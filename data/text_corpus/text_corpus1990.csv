the crop production and food security in arid regions include a biotic stress ding et al 2021 kheir et al 2021 water scarcity ding et al 2020 malik and dechmi 2019 climate change asseng et al 2018 kheir et al 2019 and rapid population growth godfray et al 2010 irrigated agriculture is critical to meeting the world s food demand because irrigation accounts for roughly half of agricultural production malek et al 2020 irrigation management may improve crop production in water stressed regions contributing to the resolution of such problems in these vulnerable areas several studies have shown the negative impact of water stress on yield and photosynthesis duration of wheat during flowering stage zhao et al 2020 and on phenological development ihsan et al 2016 furthermore excessive irrigation can raise the saline water table reducing crop yield proper irrigation management could prevent nutrient and yield loss caused by excess and insufficient irrigation furthermore it is critical to manage irrigation water use in order to achieve water productivity and economic benefits at the water food nexus clothier et al 2020 irrigation management has been studied in various studies included withholding one or more irrigation events during the growing season at specific growth stages çakir 2004 irrigation based on potential evapotranspiration dechmi et al 2003 farré and faci 2006 soil moisture depletion ding et al 2021 and leaf water potential katerji et al 2004 irrigation based actual evapotranspiration etc may be an adequate method for agricultural water management that has received less attention in arid regions despite few studies in humid regions srivastava et al 2018 in addition the accuracy of etc estimation relies mainly on the quality of weather data and the approach used despite its importance in the exchange of energy and water between soil atmosphere and land surface determining etc is difficult for direct measurement there are different methods of etc determination include eddy covariance ec volumetric lysimeters water balance energy balance penman monteith as well as the hydrological models ochoa sánchez et al 2019 the ec method proved to be a reliable technique but it is expensive and not available in many parts of the world crop simulation models csm are the most powerful tools for determining etc and managing irrigation water following a robust calibration the csm can integrate soil climate genetics and corresponding management practises ensuring crop and irrigation water management in a timely and cost effective manner asseng et al 2020 attia et al 2021 kheir et al 2020a 2020b previous research has shown that csm can be used in irrigation management and scheduling linker and kisekka 2017 liu et al 2017 tang et al 2018 the majority of previous research on crop simulation models for irrigation scheduling optimization focused on retrospective evaluation of irrigation scheduling options using experimental data and long term weather data there is very little research on using crop simulation models for real time tactical in season irrigation scheduling in the literature dssat models have been developed over the last three decades for crop prediction subject to various management practises soil climate and crop factors hoogenboom et al 2019a 2019b jones et al 2003 recently a new tool was developed in the most recent dssat version v 4 7 5 that allows irrigation based etc over crop growth stages giving these models a distinct advantage in irrigation water management this new tool need to be evaluated with different crops in various environments worldwide furthermore dssat models have another advantage in that they include multiple models for strategic crops which can improve prediction accuracy and reduce uncertainty in the arid regions there are still gaps in understanding of how different irrigation scheduling practices based on etc affect wheat yield and water productivity in this study three dssat wheat models ceres cropsim and n wheat were calibrated and evaluated using three growing season datasets and then used for long term simulation of wheat yield and water use efficiency under irrigation with different fractions of etc the objectives for this research were i to calibrate and evaluate ceres cropsim and n wheat models using datasets of irrigation based etc which determined by ec for a new high yielding wheat cultivar giza 171 ii to apply the calibrated models in predicting yield and water productivity using braod range of irrigation based etc over long term simulation 1991 2020 in different locations represent egyptian nile delta and ⅰⅰⅰ to explore the recommended irrigation treatment achieved higher yield and water productivity compared with farmer practices this is the first attempt to assess irrigation based et in csm across multiple locations and with long term weather data 2 materials and methods 2 1 study location and soil characteristics a field experiment was conducted at middle delta of egypt tanta 30 8 n and 31 0 e supplementary fig s1 and grown with new high yielding spring wheat giza 171 over three successive growing seasons 2017 2018 2018 2019 and 2019 2020 soil texture of this locaion is clay with high water holding capacity and classified as vertisol soil samples 0 150 of field experiment were collected prior to the three seasons for soil physical and chemical analysis meanwhile for other locations used in simulation the samples were collected once before first growing season supplementary table s1 the preceding crops were rice maize and sunflower in first second and third seasons respectively in the field experiment the dataset from the first growing season was used to calibrate the models while the datasets from the other two seasons were used to evaluate the models before cultivation initial soil water and nitrogen levels were measured to be used for irrigation treatments in the field experiment and later in models to reset the treatments each run supplementary table s1 2 2 experimental design and agronomic practices the experiment was performed in a split plot design with 27 plots replicated three times the main plots included sowing at different dates as early november 1 recommended november 15 and late november 30 irrigation treatments were assigned in sub main plots and irrigation triggered at the recommended threshold of soil moisture depletion from available water 50 mad and irrigation quota specified with different fractions of etc as 80 100 and 120 the timing of irrigation events was determined by daily monitoring of soil moisture using tdr heimovaara et al 2004 until the required moisture threshold was reached 50 mad the evapotranspiration values used for irrigation scheduling were measured from a nearby eddy covariance station a new high yielding cultivar of spring wheat giza 171 was selected and sown in the field experiment the recommended nitrogen fertilization 140 kg n ha 1 was divided into three doses after 20 40 and 70 days from sowing in all growing seasons crop yield yield components and phenology parameters such as grain yield final biomass grain size number of grains m2 maximum leaf area index anthesis date maturity date and grain n content were all measured and used to prepare file a in the models for calibration and evaluation 2 3 climatic data the daily climatic data sowing harvest of the experimental location consisted of maximum and minimum temperatures solar radiation and rainfall were collected from a nearby ec station and averaged over the growing season supplementary table s3 the daily weather data of 30 years 1991 2020 for all other locations represent nile delta were collected from nasa agcfsr climate dataset http data giss nasa gov impacts agmipcf supplementary fig s2 the dataset used hereinafter for long term simulation by three models 2 4 simulation study 2 4 1 description of dssat wheat models the decision support system for agrotechnology transfer dssat jones et al 2003 is a software that includes crop simulation models for over 42 crops as of version4 7 5 hoogenboom et al 2019a 2019b as well as tools to make the models easier to use database management systems for soil weather crop management and experimental data services and application programs are among the resources available as a feature of the soil plant atmosphere dynamics the models can simulate growth development and yield dssat models integrate soil weather and crop databases to simulate multi year outcomes of crop management scenarios they also interact the effects of crop soil weather and management options and allows users to ask what if questions by conducting virtual simulation experiments on a desktop computer in short time which would consume a significant part of an agronomist s career if performed in field experiments dssat includes three wheat models called ceres cropsim and n wheat which have a distinct advantage over other crop models in that they allow for the use of multiple models to reduce uncertainty the ceres wheat model which originated with modeling efforts by joe ritchie and colleagues in the 1970s can be used to simulate bread and durum wheat ritchie et al 1984 growth is modeled using a radiation use efficiency approach whereas development can be influenced by both temperature and daylength recent ceres wheat development work has primarily focused on ensuring that to the greatest extent possible model parameters of ceres wheat and cropsim wheat hunt and pararajasingham 1995 are defined in a comparable manner n wheat was recently included in dssat v4 7 as the apsim n wheat model kassie et al 2016 the input data set for n wheat is the same as for ceres wheat but it needs more cultivar coefficients to calibrate more details about n wheat modifications and its differences with ceres are detailed in asseng et al 2018 kheir et al 2019 2 4 2 model inputs the main inputs for model run include soil properties daily weather data cultivar name and characteristics and crop management the minimum weather data are maximum and minimum temperatures solar radiation rainfall and the weather station coordinate lat and long for calibration the models use different genetic parameters in genotype file such as vernalization photoperiod thermal time kernel number per unit kernel growth rate maximum stem dry weight and phyllochron interval these parameters have different codes between three models soil data include soil water content wilting point and field capacity saturation percentage drainage and runoff factors root growth factor evaporation and soil albedo crop management include irrigation treatments rates and dates fertilization doses rates and dates planting date depth and density as well as initial soil water and nitrogen either measured or estimated 2 4 3 models calibration and evaluation calibration is the process of changing each model s and cultivar s genetic coefficients to reflect the measured outputs in the study area dataset of the first growing season 2017 2018 were used for model calibration using non stress treatments boote 1999 while data of other two seasons were used for evaluation the genetic parameters of the three models were different and justified manually up to reaching the optimum values table 1 we began by calibrating the genetic parameters of crop growth and phenology followed by yield and yield components table following calibration the performance of all models was evaluated using three statistical indices such as determination coefficient r2 root mean square deviation rmsd and willmott index of agreement d jacovides and kontoyiannis 1995 moriasi et al 2007 willmott 1984 2 4 4 irrigation scheduling based et irrigation based et is a new tool in dssat models that enables irrigation with various fractions of et for this irrigation routine the automatic irrigation based et option code e was selected and irrigation events and quota were specified using three parameters these parameters are imdep which means threshold accumulation of et minus rainfall to trigger a new irrigation event mm and ithru which is the percentage of accumulated et that will be applied as irrigation for irrig e when the total accumulation is greater than imdep an irrigation is triggered then the irrigation amount sum et minus rainfall ithru using this option of irrigation scheduling we used 5 irrigation treatments to be a fraction of 50 60 70 80 90 and 100 etc the long term simulation 1991 2020 for 10 locations represent the nile delta was performed using three calibrated models i e ceres n wheat and cropsim and six irrigation treatments based et 2 5 definitions water use efficiency based et kg ha 1 mm 1 et was calculated by model as 1 wue et gy et where gy is the simulated grain yield kg ha 1 and et is the cumulative evapotranspiration irrigation water use efficiency kg ha 1 mm 1 irri was calculated using the following equation 2 wue irri gy totalwaterapplied mm where total water applied is the sum of simulated irrigation water applied under a specific treatment and the total rainfall over the growing season 2 6 statistical analysis the modeval function in the r software was used for calculations used for model calibration and evaluation indices dataset of simulated yield gy and its attributes water use efficiency wue irrigation as well as evapotranspiration etc under all irrigation scheduling treatments were analyzed using principal component analysis addinsoft 2015 to well understand the correlation between all factors 3 results 3 1 models calibration and evaluation the three dssat models were calibrated using dataset of the first growing season particularly with treatments of recommended planting date november 15 and higher irrigation levels 1 0 and 1 2 etc the calibrated genetic parameters of the cultivated cultivar giza171 for the three tested models are shown in table 1 the parameters differ between the three models but they all have a very low vernalization data in fig 1 show that the calibration of all models has been done robustly given values of grain yield biomass yield and phenology close to observed values nonetheless there are a few overestimations and underestimations based on evaluated phenology anthesis and maturity some statistical indices supplementary table s4 were used to assess the quality of the calibration process which confirmed a higher accuracy for simulated grain yield r2 values were 0 82 0 82 and 0 75 while d values were 0 92 0 92 and 0 91 for cropsim ceres and n wheat respectively supplementary table s4 this indicates that the models were able to accurately simulate grain yield when compared to observed values indicating the accuracy of their calibration the same trend was achieved with total biomass and phenology recording higher values of r2 and d whilst lower values of rmsd as a result the findings of all of the models in this analysis could be effectively used as a decision support method for selecting the best cultivars and management practices 3 2 simulated and observed evapotranspiration etc over three growing seasons etc was measured using eddy covariance ec and compared with simulated values in same period supplementary fig s3 the observed values match simulated under all treatments of sowing date and irrigation treatments with little underestimation in early sowing date november 1 the penman monteith approach was used in crop models to simulate etc values using climatic data from ec stations averaged over three sowing dates simulated values of etc were 378 346 and 335 mm for irrigation treatments of 1 2 1 0 and 0 8 etc respectively meanwhile the measured values of accumulated etc recorded 404 376 and 357 mm for irrigation treatments 1 2 1 0 and 0 8 etc respectively supplementary fig s3 thus the simulated etc values were close to the measured values indicating the accuracy of calibrated models in predicting evapotranspiration under different irrigation scheduling based et treatments when the predicted etc by three dssat models was compared to the measured values in three growing seasons under the recommended planting date the data in supplementary fig s4 show that the three models produced values that were close to the observed despite a slight underestimation of n wheat in only two of the three growing seasons as a result the calibrated models could be used successfully in long term simulations of yield and water use under a variety of irrigation scheduling based et 3 3 long term simulation of grain yield total biomass irrigation and et under different treatments of irrigation based et the calibrated models were used to predict grain yield gy and total biomass by in long term simulations across 10 different locations representing the nile delta region using 5 irrigation treatments fig 2 simulated gy and by ranged 2500 9000 kg ha 1 and 10 500 18 000 kg ha 1 respectively with associated uncertainty due to variations between years irrigation treatments and crop models irrigation scheduling based 100 etc i6 gave the superiority in simulated gy and by in most locations with non significant differences between i5 and i6 while lower values recorded under treatment of irrigation with 50 etc i1 averaged over all locations and 30 years deficit irrigation of 50 i1 60 i2 70 i3 80 i4 and 90 i5 decreased gy by 27 5 13 0 5 0 1 5 and 0 4 respectively compared with full irrigation treatment i6 fig 2a likewise the simulated biomass yield decreased by 15 0 7 0 3 0 1 2 and 0 4 respectively relative to irrigation with 100 etc fig 2b the variability of simulated gy and by between irrigation treatments in locations 6 ismalia 9 qaliobya and 10 sharkia was higher compared with other locations given higher reduction of gy and by with deficit irrigation treatments i1 i2 i3 and i4 relative to i5 fig 2 the highest simulated values of gy and by were obtained in locations 5 alexandria and 4 tanta compared with other locations simulated irrigation and et increased as irrigation treatments progressed from deficit irrigation i1 50 et to higher irrigation i6 100 et as shown in fig 3 over 30 years and 10 locations irrigation values ranged from 100 to 380 mm while et values ranged from 250 to 480 mm for irrigation treatments variability between treatments were higher in simulated irrigation fig 3a compared with simulated et fig 3b location 5 alexandria had the lowest values of simulated irrigation 80 220 mm and et 250 350 mm while location 10 had the highest values sharkia averaged over 10 locations and 30 years deficit irrigation treatments of 50 60 70 80 and 90 etc decreased simulated irrigation by 50 7 40 8 31 0 20 4 and 10 4 and et by 12 5 6 8 3 8 1 6 and 0 6 respectively relative to the full irrigation treatment 100 etc 3 4 long term simulation of wue based irrigation and et under different treatments of irrigation based et the long term simulations of water use efficiency based irrigation wue irri showed an adverse trend with irrigation treatments compared with water use efficiency based evapotranspiration wue et as shown in fig 4 for all locations and over 30 years the simulated wue et increased slightly with increasing irrigation treatments given higher values with irrigation at 90 etc and lower values at irrigation treatment of 50 etc fig 4a on the other hand the simulated values of wue irri decreased sharply with higher irrigation water applied given higher values under irrigation treatment of 50 etc and lower values under 100 etc fig 4b consequently averaged over all locations 3 models and 30 years simulation deficit irrigation of 50 60 70 and 80 etc declined wue et by 18 0 8 0 1 0 and 0 06 respectively relative to full irrigation treatment 100 etc meanwhile simulated wue et under irrigation treatment of 90 etc was higher than that in full irrigation with 0 08 on the contrary the simulated values of wue irri were increased by 40 0 42 0 35 0 22 0 and 10 6 under deficit irrigation treatments i e 50 60 70 80 and 90 etc respectively relative to irrigation with 100 etc interestingly deficit irrigation with 90 etc i5 produced higher wue values than full irrigation 100 etc with increases of 0 08 and 10 6 for wue et and wue irri respectively fig 5 respecting to locations the higher values of wue et 22 32 kg ha 1 mm 1 and wue irri 25 5 36 9 kg ha 1 mm 1 were recorded in location 5 alexandria meanwhile the lowest values of wue et 12 18 kg ha 1 mm 1 and wue irri 20 9 26 4 kg ha 1 mm 1 were noted in location 10 sharkia 3 5 comparison of simulated gy and wue et with farmer praxis irrigation at 90 etc produced the best gy by and wue during long term simulations using three dssat models therefore we used this treatment to compare simulated gy and wue irri values to measured values by farmers in the nile delta in order to highlight the economic benefits of using an appropriate irrigation scheduling program fig 6 averaged over all locations the simulated gy and wue irri increased by 1 7 and 63 respectively compared with values obtained by farmers in same area although the simulated gy in some locations such as locations 3 4 7 and 8 was lower than the farmer s yield the simulated wue irri in all locations was higher than the farmer s yield locations 1 5 and 6 had the highest simulated wue irri values increasing by13 25 and 33 when compared to farmers values this could support the importance of irrigation scheduling based on 90 etc as an appropriate irrigation scheduling program in arid regions to achieve higher yield and wue 4 discussion 4 1 models calibration and evaluation the calibration process was performed manually to determine the optimum genetic coefficients according godwin and singh 1998 of a new high yielding wheat cultivar giza171 the calibration was evaluated using some statistical indicators with lower rmsd and higher r2 and d values because of the positive relationship between crop development and yield simulated phenology was able to match observed grain yield and biomass with high accuracy ceglar et al 2011 the three tested models ceres cropsim and n wheat were robustly calibrated with yield and phenology values close to those measured in field experiments the robust calibration began with phenology archontoulis et al 2014 which included justification of p1v p1d and p5 in ceres vreq pps1 and p8 in cropsim and vsen ppsen and p5 in n wheat for anthesis and maturity date calibration the intercepted solar radiation and efficiency of radiation use are the two most important factors that can affect biomass production thus accurate calibration of total biomass is critical for model evaluation which has already been accomplished in the current study furthermore the grain yield was well calibrated due to its positive correlation with total biomass dettori et al 2011 the genetic parameters of biomass calibration are different among three dssat wheat models for ceres the biomass was determined using maximum stem and spike weight when elongation ceases g g3 meanwhile for n wheat it was controlled by the potential dray weight excluding grain stmmx and in case of cropsim the biomass was calibrated using maximum non stressed shoot dry weight shwts and area of initial leaf la1s table 1 crop canopy intercepted radiation and radiation use efficiency all contribute to grain yield grain yield has also different parameters need to be determined when calibration and differ between models such as kernel number per unit canopy weight at anthesis g1 and standard kernel size under optimum conditions g2 for ceres coefficient of kernel number per stem weight at the beginning of grain filling grno and kernel growth rate mxfil for n wheat kassie et al 2016 and maximum grain size under optimum conditions gwts and standard grains number per unit canopy weight at anthesis g wts in case of cropsim model table 1 the three models showed robust calibration indicating the selection of optimum parameters for the specific cultivar 4 2 measured and simulated et in irrigation scheduling based et et based automatic irrigation routines are new tools introduced in the latest version of dssat models v 4 7 5 the irrig switch is set to e for automatic irrigation with a determined number in this case the imdep represents the threshold accumulation of et that triggers an irrigation event when the e option is selected variable ithru can be used to set a deficit amount of irrigation it is expressed as a percentage of the accumulated et that will be applied as irrigation when compared to other crop models this function may provide dssat models with additional advantages for irrigation scheduling as a result we used the calibrated models to predict et from sowing to maturity and the models produced accurate simulations when compared to measured values supplementary figs 3 4 the et values were measured from a nearby ec station over three growing seasons resulting in high quality data when compared to those obtained by ding et al 2021 who used other methods to measure et the high quality of measured et data and well calibrated models enabled the models to perform long term simulations of yield and water use in various environments furthermore using multiple models resulted in higher accuracy with less uncertainty as previously approved in another global study by martre et al 2015 4 3 long term simulations of yield and water use efficiency under deficit irrigation based et despite the fact that water scarcity has a global negative impact on crop production in arid regions nouri et al 2019 proper irrigation scheduling may not only alleviate such yield declines but also improve yield and water productivity many previous efforts have been made in this regard to ensure a higher yield with less water use included mulching xiaomin pi 2017 drip irrigation nouri et al 2019 crop breeding tester and langridge 2010 conservation tillage azimzadeh 2012 deficit irrigation based soil moisture depletion ding et al 2021 and changes in crop pattern davis et al 2017 nonetheless there is less exposure to irrigation scheduling based evapotranspiration in arid regions particularly when crop modeling is used which will facilitate using this approach under broad management practices and climate change scenarios in less time and effort our novel approach made use of a new tool in the most recent version of dssat v4 7 5 that allows irrigation based et to generate deficit irrigation based et at 50 60 70 80 and 90 in various locations irrigation based 90 etc achieved higher yield biomass and wue etin all locations during long term simulations 1991 2020 these results are similar to those obtained during three growing seasons there were no significant differences between treatments of irrigation with 80 and 100 et this is may be due to the clay texture of soil in nile delta and contribution of water table to crop et furthermore irrigation based 90 et demonstrated greater root depth and weight in all locations when compared to other treatments supplementary fig s5 this could imply that deficit irrigation with 90 et is an appropriate irrigation scheduling method in arid regions higher yield and wue values in locations 5 alexandria and 4 tanta could be attributed to lower temperature and higher rainfall in location 5 supplementary fig s2 and soil properties in location 4 supplementary table s2 although wue irri decreased with higher irrigation water treatment 90 et no significant differences were found between wue irri and wue et at this irrigation treatment fig 4 indicating the importance of this treatment in maximizing wue the pca analysis loadings and scores was used to thoroughly understand the relationships between irrigation treatments yield and its attributes as well as wue fig 7 there is a positive relationship between wue and grain and biomass yield but a negative relationship between et and such parameters higher irrigation treatments 80 and 90 etc correlated positively with simulated yield and its components on the contrary severe irrigation treatments 50 and 60 etc showed a complete negative correlation with both higher irrigation treatments 80 and 90 etc and yield with its attributes this also translates the importance of deficit irrigation based on 90 etc in maximizing wheat yield and water productivity in arid regions which has already been confirmed by comparison with farmer practices 5 conclusions the findings of this study demonstrated the modeling of deficit irrigation based evapotranspiration in multiple locations using long term simulation three dssat wheat models were reasonably calibrated using datasets of three growing seasons and applied for long term simulation 1991 2020 of yield and water use efficiency under a broad range of deficit irrigation based et the simulation results showed that deficit irrigation based on 90 etc produced the highest yield and water productivity in all locations comparing with farmers practices in all locations simulated irrigation based 90 etc increased grain yield and water productivity by 1 7 and 63 respectively this demonstrates the value of this irrigation scheduling method in increasing yield in water stressed areas modeling of deficit irrigation based et under future climate change scenarios on the other hand could be considered an important future research to not only quantify yield reduction under water and heat stress but also to explore potential adaptation options declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or

2020 attia et al 2021 kheir et al 2020a 2020b previous research has shown that csm can be used in irrigation management and scheduling linker and kisekka 2017 liu et al 2017 tang et al 2018 the majority of previous research on crop simulation models for irrigation scheduling optimization focused on retrospective evaluation of irrigation scheduling options using experimental data and long term weather data there is very little research on using crop simulation models for real time tactical in season irrigation scheduling in the literature dssat models have been developed over the last three decades for crop prediction subject to various management practises soil climate and crop factors hoogenboom et al 2019a 2019b jones et al 2003 recently a new tool was developed in the most recent dssat version v 4 7 5 that allows irrigation based etc over crop growth stages giving these models a distinct advantage in irrigation water management this new tool need to be evaluated with different crops in various environments worldwide furthermore dssat models have another advantage in that they include multiple models for strategic crops which can improve prediction accuracy and reduce uncertainty in the arid regions there are still gaps in understanding of how different irrigation scheduling practices based on etc affect wheat yield and water productivity in this study three dssat wheat models ceres cropsim and n wheat were calibrated and evaluated using three growing season datasets and then used for long term simulation of wheat yield and water use efficiency under irrigation with different fractions of etc the objectives for this research were i to calibrate and evaluate ceres cropsim and n wheat models using datasets of irrigation based etc which determined by ec for a new high yielding wheat cultivar giza 171 ii to apply the calibrated models in predicting yield and water productivity using braod range of irrigation based etc over long term simulation 1991 2020 in different locations represent egyptian nile delta and ⅰⅰⅰ to explore the recommended irrigation treatment achieved higher yield and water productivity compared with farmer practices this is the first attempt to assess irrigation based et in csm across multiple locations and with long term weather data 2 materials and methods 2 1 study location and soil characteristics a field experiment was conducted at middle delta of egypt tanta 30 8 n and 31 0 e supplementary fig s1 and grown with new high yielding spring wheat giza 171 over three successive growing seasons 2017 2018 2018 2019 and 2019 2020 soil texture of this locaion is clay with high water holding capacity and classified as vertisol soil samples 0 150 of field experiment were collected prior to the three seasons for soil physical and chemical analysis meanwhile for other locations used in simulation the samples were collected once before first growing season supplementary table s1 the preceding crops were rice maize and sunflower in first second and third seasons respectively in the field experiment the dataset from the first growing season was used to calibrate the models while the datasets from the other two seasons were used to evaluate the models before cultivation initial soil water and nitrogen levels were measured to be used for irrigation treatments in the field experiment and later in models to reset the treatments each run supplementary table s1 2 2 experimental design and agronomic practices the experiment was performed in a split plot design with 27 plots replicated three times the main plots included sowing at different dates as early november 1 recommended november 15 and late november 30 irrigation treatments were assigned in sub main plots and irrigation triggered at the recommended threshold of soil moisture depletion from available water 50 mad and irrigation quota specified with different fractions of etc as 80 100 and 120 the timing of irrigation events was determined by daily monitoring of soil moisture using tdr heimovaara et al 2004 until the required moisture threshold was reached 50 mad the evapotranspiration values used for irrigation scheduling were measured from a nearby eddy covariance station a new high yielding cultivar of spring wheat giza 171 was selected and sown in the field experiment the recommended nitrogen fertilization 140 kg n ha 1 was divided into three doses after 20 40 and 70 days from sowing in all growing seasons crop yield yield components and phenology parameters such as grain yield final biomass grain size number of grains m2 maximum leaf area index anthesis date maturity date and grain n content were all measured and used to prepare file a in the models for calibration and evaluation 2 3 climatic data the daily climatic data sowing harvest of the experimental location consisted of maximum and minimum temperatures solar radiation and rainfall were collected from a nearby ec station and averaged over the growing season supplementary table s3 the daily weather data of 30 years 1991 2020 for all other locations represent nile delta were collected from nasa agcfsr climate dataset http data giss nasa gov impacts agmipcf supplementary fig s2 the dataset used hereinafter for long term simulation by three models 2 4 simulation study 2 4 1 description of dssat wheat models the decision support system for agrotechnology transfer dssat jones et al 2003 is a software that includes crop simulation models for over 42 crops as of version4 7 5 hoogenboom et al 2019a 2019b as well as tools to make the models easier to use database management systems for soil weather crop management and experimental data services and application programs are among the resources available as a feature of the soil plant atmosphere dynamics the models can simulate growth development and yield dssat models integrate soil weather and crop databases to simulate multi year outcomes of crop management scenarios they also interact the effects of crop soil weather and management options and allows users to ask what if questions by conducting virtual simulation experiments on a desktop computer in short time which would consume a significant part of an agronomist s career if performed in field experiments dssat includes three wheat models called ceres cropsim and n wheat which have a distinct advantage over other crop models in that they allow for the use of multiple models to reduce uncertainty the ceres wheat model which originated with modeling efforts by joe ritchie and colleagues in the 1970s can be used to simulate bread and durum wheat ritchie et al 1984 growth is modeled using a radiation use efficiency approach whereas development can be influenced by both temperature and daylength recent ceres wheat development work has primarily focused on ensuring that to the greatest extent possible model parameters of ceres wheat and cropsim wheat hunt and pararajasingham 1995 are defined in a comparable manner n wheat was recently included in dssat v4 7 as the apsim n wheat model kassie et al 2016 the input data set for n wheat is the same as for ceres wheat but it needs more cultivar coefficients to calibrate more details about n wheat modifications and its differences with ceres are detailed in asseng et al 2018 kheir et al 2019 2 4 2 model inputs the main inputs for model run include soil properties daily weather data cultivar name and characteristics and crop management the minimum weather data are maximum and minimum temperatures solar radiation rainfall and the weather station coordinate lat and long for calibration the models use different genetic parameters in genotype file such as vernalization photoperiod thermal time kernel number per unit kernel growth rate maximum stem dry weight and phyllochron interval these parameters have different codes between three models soil data include soil water content wilting point and field capacity saturation percentage drainage and runoff factors root growth factor evaporation and soil albedo crop management include irrigation treatments rates and dates fertilization doses rates and dates planting date depth and density as well as initial soil water and nitrogen either measured or estimated 2 4 3 models calibration and evaluation calibration is the process of changing each model s and cultivar s genetic coefficients to reflect the measured outputs in the study area dataset of the first growing season 2017 2018 were used for model calibration using non stress treatments boote 1999 while data of other two seasons were used for evaluation the genetic parameters of the three models were different and justified manually up to reaching the optimum values table 1 we began by calibrating the genetic parameters of crop growth and phenology followed by yield and yield components table following calibration the performance of all models was evaluated using three statistical indices such as determination coefficient r2 root mean square deviation rmsd and willmott index of agreement d jacovides and kontoyiannis 1995 moriasi et al 2007 willmott 1984 2 4 4 irrigation scheduling based et irrigation based et is a new tool in dssat models that enables irrigation with various fractions of et for this irrigation routine the automatic irrigation based et option code e was selected and irrigation events and quota were specified using three parameters these parameters are imdep which means threshold accumulation of et minus rainfall to trigger a new irrigation event mm and ithru which is the percentage of accumulated et that will be applied as irrigation for irrig e when the total accumulation is greater than imdep an irrigation is triggered then the irrigation amount sum et minus rainfall ithru using this option of irrigation scheduling we used 5 irrigation treatments to be a fraction of 50 60 70 80 90 and 100 etc the long term simulation 1991 2020 for 10 locations represent the nile delta was performed using three calibrated models i e ceres n wheat and cropsim and six irrigation treatments based et 2 5 definitions water use efficiency based et kg ha 1 mm 1 et was calculated by model as 1 wue et gy et where gy is the simulated grain yield kg ha 1 and et is the cumulative evapotranspiration irrigation water use efficiency kg ha 1 mm 1 irri was calculated using the following equation 2 wue irri gy totalwaterapplied mm where total water applied is the sum of simulated irrigation water applied under a specific treatment and the total rainfall over the growing season 2 6 statistical analysis the modeval function in the r software was used for calculations used for model calibration and evaluation indices dataset of simulated yield gy and its attributes water use efficiency wue irrigation as well as evapotranspiration etc under all irrigation scheduling treatments were analyzed using principal component analysis addinsoft 2015 to well understand the correlation between all factors 3 results 3 1 models calibration and evaluation the three dssat models were calibrated using dataset of the first growing season particularly with treatments of recommended planting date november 15 and higher irrigation levels 1 0 and 1 2 etc the calibrated genetic parameters of the cultivated cultivar giza171 for the three tested models are shown in table 1 the parameters differ between the three models but they all have a very low vernalization data in fig 1 show that the calibration of all models has been done robustly given values of grain yield biomass yield and phenology close to observed values nonetheless there are a few overestimations and underestimations based on evaluated phenology anthesis and maturity some statistical indices supplementary table s4 were used to assess the quality of the calibration process which confirmed a higher accuracy for simulated grain yield r2 values were 0 82 0 82 and 0 75 while d values were 0 92 0 92 and 0 91 for cropsim ceres and n wheat respectively supplementary table s4 this indicates that the models were able to accurately simulate grain yield when compared to observed values indicating the accuracy of their calibration the same trend was achieved with total biomass and phenology recording higher values of r2 and d whilst lower values of rmsd as a result the findings of all of the models in this analysis could be effectively used as a decision support method for selecting the best cultivars and management practices 3 2 simulated and observed evapotranspiration etc over three growing seasons etc was measured using eddy covariance ec and compared with simulated values in same period supplementary fig s3 the observed values match simulated under all treatments of sowing date and irrigation treatments with little underestimation in early sowing date november 1 the penman monteith approach was used in crop models to simulate etc values using climatic data from ec stations averaged over three sowing dates simulated values of etc were 378 346 and 335 mm for irrigation treatments of 1 2 1 0 and 0 8 etc respectively meanwhile the measured values of accumulated etc recorded 404 376 and 357 mm for irrigation treatments 1 2 1 0 and 0 8 etc respectively supplementary fig s3 thus the simulated etc values were close to the measured values indicating the accuracy of calibrated models in predicting evapotranspiration under different irrigation scheduling based et treatments when the predicted etc by three dssat models was compared to the measured values in three growing seasons under the recommended planting date the data in supplementary fig s4 show that the three models produced values that were close to the observed despite a slight underestimation of n wheat in only two of the three growing seasons as a result the calibrated models could be used successfully in long term simulations of yield and water use under a variety of irrigation scheduling based et 3 3 long term simulation of grain yield total biomass irrigation and et under different treatments of irrigation based et the calibrated models were used to predict grain yield gy and total biomass by in long term simulations across 10 different locations representing the nile delta region using 5 irrigation treatments fig 2 simulated gy and by ranged 2500 9000 kg ha 1 and 10 500 18 000 kg ha 1 respectively with associated uncertainty due to variations between years irrigation treatments and crop models irrigation scheduling based 100 etc i6 gave the superiority in simulated gy and by in most locations with non significant differences between i5 and i6 while lower values recorded under treatment of irrigation with 50 etc i1 averaged over all locations and 30 years deficit irrigation of 50 i1 60 i2 70 i3 80 i4 and 90 i5 decreased gy by 27 5 13 0 5 0 1 5 and 0 4 respectively compared with full irrigation treatment i6 fig 2a likewise the simulated biomass yield decreased by 15 0 7 0 3 0 1 2 and 0 4 respectively relative to irrigation with 100 etc fig 2b the variability of simulated gy and by between irrigation treatments in locations 6 ismalia 9 qaliobya and 10 sharkia was higher compared with other locations given higher reduction of gy and by with deficit irrigation treatments i1 i2 i3 and i4 relative to i5 fig 2 the highest simulated values of gy and by were obtained in locations 5 alexandria and 4 tanta compared with other locations simulated irrigation and et increased as irrigation treatments progressed from deficit irrigation i1 50 et to higher irrigation i6 100 et as shown in fig 3 over 30 years and 10 locations irrigation values ranged from 100 to 380 mm while et values ranged from 250 to 480 mm for irrigation treatments variability between treatments were higher in simulated irrigation fig 3a compared with simulated et fig 3b location 5 alexandria had the lowest values of simulated irrigation 80 220 mm and et 250 350 mm while location 10 had the highest values sharkia averaged over 10 locations and 30 years deficit irrigation treatments of 50 60 70 80 and 90 etc decreased simulated irrigation by 50 7 40 8 31 0 20 4 and 10 4 and et by 12 5 6 8 3 8 1 6 and 0 6 respectively relative to the full irrigation treatment 100 etc 3 4 long term simulation of wue based irrigation and et under different treatments of irrigation based et the long term simulations of water use efficiency based irrigation wue irri showed an adverse trend with irrigation treatments compared with water use efficiency based evapotranspiration wue et as shown in fig 4 for all locations and over 30 years the simulated wue et increased slightly with increasing irrigation treatments given higher values with irrigation at 90 etc and lower values at irrigation treatment of 50 etc fig 4a on the other hand the simulated values of wue irri decreased sharply with higher irrigation water applied given higher values under irrigation treatment of 50 etc and lower values under 100 etc fig 4b consequently averaged over all locations 3 models and 30 years simulation deficit irrigation of 50 60 70 and 80 etc declined wue et by 18 0 8 0 1 0 and 0 06 respectively relative to full irrigation treatment 100 etc meanwhile simulated wue et under irrigation treatment of 90 etc was higher than that in full irrigation with 0 08 on the contrary the simulated values of wue irri were increased by 40 0 42 0 35 0 22 0 and 10 6 under deficit irrigation treatments i e 50 60 70 80 and 90 etc respectively relative to irrigation with 100 etc interestingly deficit irrigation with 90 etc i5 produced higher wue values than full irrigation 100 etc with increases of 0 08 and 10 6 for wue et and wue irri respectively fig 5 respecting to locations the higher values of wue et 22 32 kg ha 1 mm 1 and wue irri 25 5 36 9 kg ha 1 mm 1 were recorded in location 5 alexandria meanwhile the lowest values of wue et 12 18 kg ha 1 mm 1 and wue irri 20 9 26 4 kg ha 1 mm 1 were noted in location 10 sharkia 3 5 comparison of simulated gy and wue et with farmer praxis irrigation at 90 etc produced the best gy by and wue during long term simulations using three dssat models therefore we used this treatment to compare simulated gy and wue irri values to measured values by farmers in the nile delta in order to highlight the economic benefits of using an appropriate irrigation scheduling program fig 6 averaged over all locations the simulated gy and wue irri increased by 1 7 and 63 respectively compared with values obtained by farmers in same area although the simulated gy in some locations such as locations 3 4 7 and 8 was lower than the farmer s yield the simulated wue irri in all locations was higher than the farmer s yield locations 1 5 and 6 had the highest simulated wue irri values increasing by13 25 and 33 when compared to farmers values this could support the importance of irrigation scheduling based on 90 etc as an appropriate irrigation scheduling program in arid regions to achieve higher yield and wue 4 discussion 4 1 models calibration and evaluation the calibration process was performed manually to determine the optimum genetic coefficients according godwin and singh 1998 of a new high yielding wheat cultivar giza171 the calibration was evaluated using some statistical indicators with lower rmsd and higher r2 and d values because of the positive relationship between crop development and yield simulated phenology was able to match observed grain yield and biomass with high accuracy ceglar et al 2011 the three tested models ceres cropsim and n wheat were robustly calibrated with yield and phenology values close to those measured in field experiments the robust calibration began with phenology archontoulis et al 2014 which included justification of p1v p1d and p5 in ceres vreq pps1 and p8 in cropsim and vsen ppsen and p5 in n wheat for anthesis and maturity date calibration the intercepted solar radiation and efficiency of radiation use are the two most important factors that can affect biomass production thus accurate calibration of total biomass is critical for model evaluation which has already been accomplished in the current study furthermore the grain yield was well calibrated due to its positive correlation with total biomass dettori et al 2011 the genetic parameters of biomass calibration are different among three dssat wheat models for ceres the biomass was determined using maximum stem and spike weight when elongation ceases g g3 meanwhile for n wheat it was controlled by the potential dray weight excluding grain stmmx and in case of cropsim the biomass was calibrated using maximum non stressed shoot dry weight shwts and area of initial leaf la1s table 1 crop canopy intercepted radiation and radiation use efficiency all contribute to grain yield grain yield has also different parameters need to be determined when calibration and differ between models such as kernel number per unit canopy weight at anthesis g1 and standard kernel size under optimum conditions g2 for ceres coefficient of kernel number per stem weight at the beginning of grain filling grno and kernel growth rate mxfil for n wheat kassie et al 2016 and maximum grain size under optimum conditions gwts and standard grains number per unit canopy weight at anthesis g wts in case of cropsim model table 1 the three models showed robust calibration indicating the selection of optimum parameters for the specific cultivar 4 2 measured and simulated et in irrigation scheduling based et et based automatic irrigation routines are new tools introduced in the latest version of dssat models v 4 7 5 the irrig switch is set to e for automatic irrigation with a determined number in this case the imdep represents the threshold accumulation of et that triggers an irrigation event when the e option is selected variable ithru can be used to set a deficit amount of irrigation it is expressed as a percentage of the accumulated et that will be applied as irrigation when compared to other crop models this function may provide dssat models with additional advantages for irrigation scheduling as a result we used the calibrated models to predict et from sowing to maturity and the models produced accurate simulations when compared to measured values supplementary figs 3 4 the et values were measured from a nearby ec station over three growing seasons resulting in high quality data when compared to those obtained by ding et al 2021 who used other methods to measure et the high quality of measured et data and well calibrated models enabled the models to perform long term simulations of yield and water use in various environments furthermore using multiple models resulted in higher accuracy with less uncertainty as previously approved in another global study by martre et al 2015 4 3 long term simulations of yield and water use efficiency under deficit irrigation based et despite the fact that water scarcity has a global negative impact on crop production in arid regions nouri et al 2019 proper irrigation scheduling may not only alleviate such yield declines but also improve yield and water productivity many previous efforts have been made in this regard to ensure a higher yield with less water use included mulching xiaomin pi 2017 drip irrigation nouri et al 2019 crop breeding tester and langridge 2010 conservation tillage azimzadeh 2012 deficit irrigation based soil moisture depletion ding et al 2021 and changes in crop pattern davis et al 2017 nonetheless there is less exposure to irrigation scheduling based evapotranspiration in arid regions particularly when crop modeling is used which will facilitate using this approach under broad management practices and climate change scenarios in less time and effort our novel approach made use of a new tool in the most recent version of dssat v4 7 5 that allows irrigation based et to generate deficit irrigation based et at 50 60 70 80 and 90 in various locations irrigation based 90 etc achieved higher yield biomass and wue etin all locations during long term simulations 1991 2020 these results are similar to those obtained during three growing seasons there were no significant differences between treatments of irrigation with 80 and 100 et this is may be due to the clay texture of soil in nile delta and contribution of water table to crop et furthermore irrigation based 90 et demonstrated greater root depth and weight in all locations when compared to other treatments supplementary fig s5 this could imply that deficit irrigation with 90 et is an appropriate irrigation scheduling method in arid regions higher yield and wue values in locations 5 alexandria and 4 tanta could be attributed to lower temperature and higher rainfall in location 5 supplementary fig s2 and soil properties in location 4 supplementary table s2 although wue irri decreased with higher irrigation water treatment 90 et no significant differences were found between wue irri and wue et at this irrigation treatment fig 4 indicating the importance of this treatment in maximizing wue the pca analysis loadings and scores was used to thoroughly understand the relationships between irrigation treatments yield and its attributes as well as wue fig 7 there is a positive relationship between wue and grain and biomass yield but a negative relationship between et and such parameters higher irrigation treatments 80 and 90 etc correlated positively with simulated yield and its components on the contrary severe irrigation treatments 50 and 60 etc showed a complete negative correlation with both higher irrigation treatments 80 and 90 etc and yield with its attributes this also translates the importance of deficit irrigation based on 90 etc in maximizing wheat yield and water productivity in arid regions which has already been confirmed by comparison with farmer practices 5 conclusions the findings of this study demonstrated the modeling of deficit irrigation based evapotranspiration in multiple locations using long term simulation three dssat wheat models were reasonably calibrated using datasets of three growing seasons and applied for long term simulation 1991 2020 of yield and water use efficiency under a broad range of deficit irrigation based et the simulation results showed that deficit irrigation based on 90 etc produced the highest yield and water productivity in all locations comparing with farmers practices in all locations simulated irrigation based 90 etc increased grain yield and water productivity by 1 7 and 63 respectively this demonstrates the value of this irrigation scheduling method in increasing yield in water stressed areas modeling of deficit irrigation based et under future climate change scenarios on the other hand could be considered an important future research to not only quantify yield reduction under water and heat stress but also to explore potential adaptation options declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or

9951,the lack of knowledge on the effects of alternating drip irrigation adi on soil gas emissions limits the understanding of the trade off between irrigation and soil gas emissions to determine the effects of adi on soil gas emissions this study investigated soil gas emissions microbial community composition and root soil interactions in a tomato crop under adi with different lower limits 50 60 and 70 field capacity fc with mulched drip irrigation mdi used as a control adi with different lower limits differentially affected root growth and microbial community composition these differences regulated root soil interactions and affected soil gas emissions compared with adi at 60 fc adi at 50 and 70 fc increased root fork numbers by 14 7 and 26 5 respectively and compared with mdi and adi at 60 fc these treatments also increased the abundance based coverage estimators of bacterial communities furthermore the total cumulative co2 emissions from adi at 50 and 70 fc were 42 1 and 46 8 greater than that of mdi respectively and the total cumulative n2o emissions from both treatments were 70 0 and 35 0 greater than those under mdi respectively compared with mdi adi at 60 fc increased the total cumulative co2 flux by 27 7 although the latter decreased the root fork numbers and abundance based coverage estimators of bacterial communities importantly the tomato yield and water use efficiency under adi at 60 fc were intermediate for the various treatments and the yield scaled soil gas emissions were significantly lower than those under adi at 50 and 70 fc therefore adi at 60 fc is a suitable irrigation method for optimizing tomato crop water use efficiency and reducing gas emissions taken together these results provide a new perspective for reducing soil gas emissions based on regulating the soil microbial community and root soil interaction mechanisms through soil water management keywords alternating drip irrigation soil co2 soil n2o soil microbial community root zone soil 1 introduction agroecosystems are relatively fragile and can be easily disturbed by natural factors and agricultural management practices such as farming fertilization and irrigation lal 2004 inevitably agroecosystems are an important source of greenhouse gas emissions co2 and n2o emissions from farmlands account for 25 and 60 respectively of anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions ipcc 2007 with societal and economic development controlled environment agriculture cea has become an important agronomic practice for example the total cea planting area in china reached approximately 4 million hectares in 2014 cea soil is an important source of greenhouse gas emissions because of the large amount of fertilizer input and the high frequency of irrigation chen et al 2004 yun cai et al 2012 therefore cea water management optimization is important for reducing soil greenhouse gas emissions soil greenhouse gases originate mainly from plant roots and soil microbial respiration biasi et al 2014 chen et al 2015 plant root biomass and architecture are governed mainly by soil moisture content the spatial distribution of soil particles and soil nutrients differences in root growth not only directly affect root soil respiration but also indirectly regulate microbial respiration by regulating root soil microbe interactions soil microbes i e bacteria and fungi can promote plant root growth by increasing the availability of nutrients such as carbon nitrogen and phosphorus affecting the carbon and nitrogen cycles ye et al 2018 and soil greenhouse gas emissions rashid et al 2016 moreover soil microbial activity is closely related to community composition which is affected by root morphology and activity under different soil moisture contents and spatial distributions in water scarce areas drip irrigation an efficient water conservation measure has been widely used in cea hou et al 2010 the ongoing promotion of drip irrigation has led to different developments such as mulched drip irrigation mdi underground drip irrigation root area based alternating drip irrigation adi and deficit drip irrigation various drip irrigation methods can cause substantial differences in the soil environment phogat et al 2016 rodrigues et al 2013 topak et al 2016 which can cause substantial amounts of soil gas emissions mdi accelerates the wetting drying alternation in the root zone thereby significantly affecting the temporal and spatial heterogeneity of soil temperature moisture and porosity hou et al 2010 khalil and baggs 2005 and enhancing plant root activity assouline et al 2006 microbial activity neilsen et al 2014 soil respiration and greenhouse gas emissions several studies have shown that compared with flood irrigation mdi results in less soil evaporation and soil co2 flux li et al 2011 in addition compared with furrow irrigation mdi uses less water but causes substantial changes in the wetted soil area sánchez martín et al 2008 thus reducing n2o emissions while greatly improving water efficiency kennedy et al 2013 wang et al 2016 adi in which the soil on both sides of the root system alternates between dry and wet conditions was developed on the basis of mdi ahmadi et al 2014 many studies have shown that compared with mdi adi can substantially improve plant water use efficiency without reducing plant yields shu et al 2020 one reason is that adi not only can improve microbial activity wang et al 2008 but also can alter microbial community composition and increase the abundance of nitrogen and phosphorus metabolizing microbiota wang et al 2017 another reason is that the frequent alternation of wetting and drying in root zone caused by adi improves root activity and root length liu et al 2020 under adi changes in microbial community composition and root growth can further affect the root soil microbe interaction and thus affect greenhouse gas emissions this occurs because most of the soil respiration is due to populations of nitrifying and denitrifying bacteria and fungi zhao et al 2011 previous studies have shown that the dry and wet soil cycles generated by adi can stimulate the mineralization of soil organic carbon and nitrogen and promote plant absorption of these two elements however adi may also lead to greater soil carbon and nitrogen loss sun et al 2013 compared with drip irrigation alternate furrow irrigation was reported to reduce soil co2 emissions by 14 qin et al 2018 however few studies have investigated greenhouse gas emissions under adi and even fewer studies have explored the relationships between greenhouse gas emissions and microbial community composition and root growth furthermore studies on soil greenhouse gas emissions under mdi and adi are scarce this lack of information limits the in depth understanding of the impact of adi on greenhouse gas emissions and restricts the optimization and improvement of adi and related drip irrigation technology i e mdi in turn the ability to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and further improve the efficient use of water and soil resources in cea is hindered therefore to elucidate the mechanism through which adi affects greenhouse gas emissions adi must be studied from the perspective of its effects on soil microbial community changes and root soil microbe interactions in addition intense agricultural practices under cea require a trade off between irrigation and soil gas emissions to achieve increased yields previous studies have attempted to balance the direct relationship between soil gas emissions irrigation volume and tomato yield by adopting aerated irrigation chen et al 2018 to balance soil n2o emissions and n use efficiency by adjusting soil tillage methods kong et al 2009 and to reduce soil gas emissions by decreasing the irrigation volume and optimizing irrigation methods fawibe et al 2019 han et al 2017 however what is the trade off between irrigation and soil gas emissions under adi there is currently no definitive answer from this perspective determining the internal mechanism of the effects of adi on soil gas emissions is urgently needed one assumption is that differences in the plant root zone caused by adi under different soil moisture contents would result in differences in root growth and soil microbial composition compared with those under mdi regulate root soil microbe interactions and ultimately affect greenhouse gas emissions in this study the effects of adi on soil co2 and n2o emissions tomato root growth and soil bacterial and fungal community composition and diversity in a greenhouse setting were evaluated conventional mdi served as a control interactions among soil environmental factors microorganisms and greenhouse gases were studied to analyze the internal mechanism of the effects of adi on soil greenhouse emissions the results serve as a reference for the rational application of drip irrigation and improving irrigation systems 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental design this experiment was executed from october 2018 to may 2019 in a greenhouse 108 m 8 m in yangling shaanxi province the soil bulk density was 1 4 g cm 3 and the field capacity was 28 2 mass water content the soil is a brown lou soil with an organic matter content of 16 5 g kg 1 a phosphorus content of 0 4 g kg 1 a nitrogen content of 1 0 g kg 1 and a potassium content of 10 4 g kg 1 the test plant species was tomato the greenhouse space was divided into different plots with two ridges in each plot the cross section of each plot was in the shape of a trapezoid with a length of 6 0 m height of 0 2 m top width of 0 6 m and bottom width of 0 3 m seventeen plants were cultivated in each row at a spacing of 0 35 m separate rows were established on both sides of each plot conventional mdi was used as the control the drip irrigation tube was located directly between the two rows the upper and lower limits of irrigation were 80 and 70 field capacity respectively three adi treatments adi50 adi60 and adi70 were established with upper irrigation limits of 60 70 and 80 field capacity respectively and lower limits of 50 60 and 70 field capacity respectively another drip irrigation tube was placed 40 cm from the plant roots at both ends of each plot for each irrigation event the irrigation tube at only one end of the planting plot was turned on and the other end was turned on during the next session thus irrigation alternated between the two ends each treatment was replicated three times for a total of 12 plots all the plots were covered with 0 014 mm thick white plastic film manufactured at the xinfeng plastic factory china the drip irrigation tube had a diameter of 16 mm a wall thickness of 0 3 mm and drip holes at every 30 cm the working pressure and drip flow were 0 1 mpa and 1 5 l h 1 respectively soil moisture was measured by a tdr 200 soil moisture meter spectrum usa for this three probe tubes were installed at a depth of 100 cm in each mdi plot and at each end of the adi plots the moisture contents were measured every 10 cm and the values were corrected by soil drilling and the oven drying method bittelli et al 2008 eller and denoth 1996 the soil moisture content was measured every 3 5 days according to the plant growth conditions and measurements were performed before and after each irrigation event when the soil moisture content under mdi or on the wet side under adi reached the lower limit moisture was applied in accordance with the irrigation formula supplementary formula 1 assuming a 40 cm thick wet soil layer during the experimental period the irrigation volumes under mdi adi50 adi60 and adi704 were 290 0 219 3 251 6 and 280 2 mm respectively as shown in supplementary table 1 the tomato water requirements under mdi adi50 adi60 and adi704 were 281 2 210 4 245 1 and 274 0 mm respectively as calculated according to supplementary formula 2 oweis et al 2011 therefore the water requirements of tomato under each treatment were satisfied during the experiment adi50 underwent 13 irrigation cycles 9 cycles in the flowering and fruit set period and four cycles in the fruit maturation period adi60 underwent nine irrigation cycles six cycles in the flowering and fruit set period and three cycles in the fruit maturation period and adi70 underwent seven irrigation cycles five cycles in the flowering and fruit set period and two cycles in the fruit maturation period supplementary table 1 2 2 indicator measurements 2 2 1 soil temperature dissolved organic carbon no3 n and porosity ground thermometers were placed with the 0 25 cm soil layer at 5 cm intervals in the front middle and back of each plot to measure soil temperature measurements were taken every 5 days at 10 00 am the average soil temperature c during the tomato growing period was subsequently calculated at 40 90 and 130 days after transplanting three soil samples were collected from the tomato root zone via the digging method in each treatment the contents of soil dissolved organic carbon and soil no3 n were determined by a continuous flow analyzer and the mean values during the growth period were calculated wang et al 2016 after harvesting three sampling points were selected in each planted groove in an s shape soil samples were collected throughout the 0 40 cm soil profile at 10 cm intervals with a ring knife 100 cm3 and returned to the laboratory for drying and soil bulk density measurements the bulk density was calculated according to supplementary formula 3 the soil porosity was calculated on the basis of the soil bulk density according to supplementary formula 4 2 2 2 tomato root system three representative plants with uniform growth per plot were selected and labeled when the fruits were ripe root samples of labeled plants were subsequently collected by removing the entire root system to the midline between two adjacent plants within a rectangular area 40 cm 30 cm the digging depth was the same as the actual root depth approximately 50 cm fig 1 root samples were returned to the laboratory soaked in water and then rinsed with water to separate soil particles the length area and other properties of clean roots were determined via a root analysis system 2 2 3 soil bacterial and fungal communities the soils in the root zone of the plants in each treatment were collected by digging methods in 1 2 2 these soils were then used for determining the soil bacterial and fungal community compositions and the diversity indices via high throughput sequencing as described in the supplementary methods 2 2 4 soil greenhouse gases soil co2 and n2o gases were collected in situ via the static black box method the static box used was custom made on the basis of the experimental needs the box consisted of two parts namely a base and a box which were composed of 1 mm thick stainless steel plates the dimensions of the outer box were 40 cm 40 cm 50 cm length width height respectively and the dimensions of the inner box were 35 cm 35 cm 50 cm length width height respectively the outer surface of the box was wrapped with foam and reflective film for insulation a small fan was installed inside the box for mixing during gas collection and as a sampling port a three way valve was installed at the bottom of the box the dimensions of the base were 40 cm 40 cm 5 cm length width height respectively and the base had a 3 cm wide groove and a ground wedge 10 cm long at each corner after the plants were transplanted the base was installed in the plot such that the base touched the soil and the upper edge of the groove was located at ground level the base remained fixed during plant growth to avoid any soil disturbance during gas collection the base groove was filled with water and then embedded into the box forming a closed collection box soil gases were collected every 10 days from november 10 2019 until tomato harvest after the box was sealed the fan was turned on for 1 min to mix the gases in the box which was marked as time 0 the soil gases were collected using a 50 ml medical syringe at 15 min intervals for 45 min at the time of sampling the temperature inside the box was measured with a thermometer installed on top of the box and the air temperature was measured using a thermometer 1 5 m above the soil surface the soil gases were analyzed with a gas chromatography system agilent usa specifically the co2 was analyzed with a flame ionization detector fid with column and detector temperatures of 80 and 200 c respectively for co2 analysis the carrier fuel and combustion supporting

together with one way anova via duncan s method p 0 05 in addition pearson s correlations were used to analyze correlations among soil environmental factors microorganisms and greenhouse gases 3 results 3 1 effects of adi on average soil temperature porosity and root growth as shown in table 1 compared with adi50 adi70 increased the average soil temperature by 11 3 significant differences in porosity were detected at various depths among the different irrigation methods and different lower limits of adi the porosity at 0 20 cm under adi70 was significantly greater 14 0 24 2 and 5 6 than that under mdi adi50 and adi60 respectively compared with mdi adi50 adi60 and adi70 increased the soil dissolved organic carbon contents by 97 8 41 4 and 81 9 respectively and adi50 adi60 and adi70 improved the soil no3 n contents by 1 4 2 8 and 1 6 times respectively in addition compared with mdi adi50 and adi70 increased the root volume by 41 8 and 35 2 respectively and adi50 and adi70 increased the root fork numbers by 2 6 and 2 9 times respectively the root forks under adi60 were 2 3 times greater than those under mdi 3 2 effects of adi on soil bacterial and fungal communities compared with those under mdi the numbers of bacterial dna sequences under adi50 and adi70 increased by 60 4 and 62 1 respectively but the number under adi60 decreased by 10 8 table 2 compared with mdi and adi60 both adi50 and adi70 significantly increased the abundance abundance based coverage estimator ace index of the bacterial communities bacteria with a relative abundance greater than 1 in a community were analyzed at the genus level conventional mdi and adi resulted in increases in the relative abundance of different bacteria fig 2 for example mdi led to pseudomonas abundance values that were 12 3 15 2 and 5 2 times greater than those resulting from adi50 adi60 and adi70 respectively flavobacterium abundance values that were 6 1 7 7 and 1 3 times greater than those resulting from adi50 adi60 and adi70 respectively and acinetobacter abundance values that were 454 6 150 0 and 13 6 times greater than those resulting from adi50 adi60 and adi70 respectively however adi50 adi60 and adi70 led to rhodanobacter abundance values that were 7 3 9 0 and 17 3 times greater respectively than that under mdi tm7 abundance values that were 72 1 5 9 and 4 3 times greater respectively than that under mdi luteimonas abundance values that were 2 2 4 0 and 3 1 times greater respectively than that under mdi and truepera abundance values that were 5 1 2 0 and 2 2 times greater respectively than that under mdi in addition compared with mdi adi50 adi60 and adi70 led to 140 2 81 3 and 67 9 increases respectively in bacillus abundance compared with those under adi50 adi50 and adi70 the fungal dna sequences under mdi increased by 21 5 21 5 and 7 3 respectively compared with adi50 and adi60 both mdi and adi70 significantly increased the ace of fungal communities the shannon indices of the fungal communities among the four treatments significantly differed with the largest value under adi70 the fungal community compositions were evaluated on the basis of major fungal genera with relative abundance levels greater than 1 fig 3 in the fungal community under mdi the top three fungal genera were unclassified o pleosporales 27 8 verticillium 24 4 and norank p mucoromycota 13 3 the top three fungal genera under adi50 were unclassified o pleosporales 37 5 chaetomium 17 3 and verticillium 11 4 however those under adi60 were verticillium 27 3 chaetomium 17 1 and unclassified o microascales 9 9 and those under adi70 were chaetomium 21 9 unclassified p ascomycota 16 7 and unclassified o pleosporales 14 9 the fungal community under mdi presented norank p mucoromycota abundance values that were 1 9 2 2 and 5 7 times greater than those under adi50 adi60 and adi70 respectively and nuclearia abundance values that were 4 3 3 0 and 2 8 times greater than those under adi50 adi60 and adi70 respectively however adi50 adi60 and adi70 led to unclassified f norank o agaricales abundance values that were 3 1 3 4 and 9 7 times greater than those resulting from mdi respectively 3 3 effects of adi on soil gas emissions the trends of soil co2 emission fluxes during the flowering and fruit set period and the fruit maturation period under the four treatments were similar fig 4 however the numbers of emission peaks and time nodes differed significantly mdi produced three emission peaks the main peak occurred 90 days after transplanting and two minor peaks occurred 60 and 120 days after tomato transplanting adi50 and adi70 produced two emission peaks the main peak occurred 70 days after transplanting and a minor peak occurred 120 days after transplanting adi60 produced three emission peaks the main peak occurred 70 days after transplanting and two minor peaks occurred 90 and 120 days after transplanting compared with those under mdi the cumulative co2 fluxes during the flowering and fruit set period under adi50 adi60 and adi70 increased by 49 3 42 3 and 79 9 respectively similarly the cumulative co2 fluxes during the same period under adi70 increased by 20 5 and 26 4 compared with those under adi50 and adi60 respectively the cumulative co2 flux during the fruit maturation period under adi50 was 1 3 times greater than that under mdi whereas the cumulative co2 flux under adi70 was 25 2 lower than that under mdi the total cumulative co2 fluxes under adi50 and adi70 did not significantly differ but were 42 1 and 46 8 greater respectively than those under mdi moreover the total cumulative co2 flux under adi60 was 27 7 greater than that under mdi table 3 fig 4 shows that the trends of n2o emission fluxes under the different treatments during the flowering and fruit set the fruit maturation periods differed and that the numbers of peaks and time nodes differed significantly mdi produced two emission peaks the main peak occurred 90 days after transplanting and a minor peak occurred 120 days after transplanting adi50 and adi70 produced two emission peaks the main peak occurred 60 days after transplanting and a minor peak occurred 90 days after transplanting adi60 produced one emissions peak 60 days after transplanting and the flux first increased but then decreased no significant difference in the cumulative n2o emission flux was observed between the adi50 and adi70 treatments during the flowering and fruit set period whereas the cumulative n2o emission fluxes under adi50 and adi70 were 2 3 and 2 1 times greater respectively than that under mdi and the differences were significant the cumulative soil n2o emission fluxes during the fruit maturation period under mdi and adi50 were significantly greater than those under adi60 and adi70 and the cumulative soil n2o emission fluxes during the same period under adi60 and adi70 were 61 6 and 51 6 lower respectively than that under mdi the total n2o emissions under adi50 were 70 0 greater than those under mdi and adi60 and the total n2o emissions under adi70 were 35 0 greater than those under adi60 and mdi table 3 comparative analysis of the soil co2 and n2o emission trends revealed that the co2 and n2o emission curves under mdi exhibited similar trends and emission peak times whereas those under adi50 adi60 and adi70 exhibited significantly different trends and emission peak times supplementary fig 1 under mdi the soil co2 emissions changed significantly faster than did the soil n2o emissions within 50 70 days after transplanting however the soil n2o emissions changed significantly faster than the soil co2 emissions under adi50 adi60 and adi70 within 110 130 days after transplanting the soil n2o emissions changed significantly faster than the soil co2 emissions did under mdi however the soil co2 emissions changed significantly faster than the soil n2o emissions did under adi50 adi60 and adi70 3 4 correlation analysis correlation analysis revealed that the cumulative soil co2 emissions were significantly positively correlated with the number of root forks and volume however the cumulative emissions of soil n2o were significantly and positively correlated with the bacterial community ace table 4 furthermore the relationships among cumulative soil gas emissions tomato root growth the soil bacterial community index and the soil fungal community index were analyzed by stepwise regression the results of which are described via the following formulas 1 cumulative emissions of soil co2 1 04 root forks 0 13 0 10 cm soil porosity 40 06 p 0 004 and 2 cumulative emissions of soil n2o 0 95 bacterial community ace 0 21 fungal community ace 0 56 p 0 021 the correlations between the major species composing the soil bacterial communities at the genus level and cumulative soil gas emissions were determined fig 5 the cumulative co2 fluxes were significantly positively correlated with abundance of haliangium lysobacter norank f a4b norank f microscillaceae norank f norank o saccharimonadales olb13 and rhodanobacter the cumulative n2o fluxes were significantly positively correlated with the abundance of bacillus chryseolinea iamia norank f akyg1722 norank f env ops 17 norank f gemmatimonadaceae norank f jg30 kf cm45 norank f norank o norank c alphaproteobacteria orank f norank o norank c gitt gs 136 norank f norank o s085 norank f norank o sbr1031 and truepera similarly correlations between the major species composing the soil fungal communities at the genus level and cumulative soil gas emissions were also determined fig 6 the cumulative co2 fluxes were negatively correlated with the abundance of norank f colpodea and unclassified o hypocreales however the cumulative n2o fluxes were negatively correlated with the abundance of norank f pyronemataceae and verticillium and significantly positively correlated with that of unclassified d eukaryota 3 5 effects of adi on tomato yield irrigation volume iwue and yield scaled soil gas emissions compared with those under mdi the tomato yields under adi60 and adi70 significantly increased by 3 7 and 13 1 respectively however the tomato yield under adi50 decreased by 6 3 table 5 compared with those under adi50 and adi60 the irrigation volumes under mdi significantly increased by 32 2 and 15 3 respectively but did not significantly differ from those under adi70 on the other hand compared with that under mdi iwue under adi50 adi60 and adi70 significantly increased by 43 9 20 3 and 19 1 respectively adi50 not only caused ys co2 levels to be 1 5 1 2 and 1 2 times greater respectively than those under mdi adi60 and adi70 but also caused ys n2o levels to be 1 8 1 9 and 1 5 times greater respectively than those under mdi adi60 and adi70 ys co2 and ys n2o under adi70 were significantly lower than those under adi50 but were 30 0 and 21 7 greater respectively than those under mdi although ys co2 under adi60 was greater than that under mdi the ys n2o levels were the same under adi60 and mdi 4 discussion 4 1 compared with mdi adi results in different co2 and n2o emission trends soil co2 emissions originate primarily from plant root and microbial respiration biasi et al 2014 chen et al 2015 on the other hand soil n2o emissions are derived mainly from microbial nitrification and denitrification kennedy et al 2013 sánchez martín et al 2008 wang et al 2016 soil moisture is the limiting factor for both plant root and soil microbial growth irrigation in cea is frequent and intensive different water supply methods mdi and adi can substantially differentially affect various soil abiotic factors such as water availability gas heat distribution and porosity assouline 2002 khalil and baggs 2005 wang et al 2000 furthermore variations in soil environmental factors can affect the growth of both microbes and plant roots assouline et al 2006 neilsen et al 2014 the results of the present study showed that compared with mdi adi not only significantly increased the soil porosity with a depth of 0 20 cm soil dissolved organic carbon levels and soil no3 n levels table 1 but also significantly altered the composition of soil bacterial and fungal communities figs 2 and 3 thus these irrigation methods inevitably affect both soil co2 and n2o generation and emissions liu et al 2012 the soil co2 and n2o emissions in the greenhouse exhibited patterns that significantly differed between conventional mdi and adi the soil co2 and n2o emission curves under mdi tended to be similar and peaked at the same time compared with those under conventional mdi however the co2 and n2o emission curves under adi exhibited significantly different trends and peaked at significantly different times i e the main emission peak occurred earlier supplementary fig 1 in addition most cumulative co2 and n2o emissions under adi were due to peaks at 70 and 60 days respectively but these peaks were delayed under mdi these differences may be due to the increased alternating dry wet frequency during the flowering and fruit set period compared with the fruit maturation period caused by adi in the root zone frequent alternating drying wetting cycles are conducive to nutrient release by soil particles and increased soil microbial activity the results of the present experiment showed that compared with mdi adi significantly increased the relative abundance of haliangium lysobacter norank f norank o saccharimonadales olb13 rhodanobacter bacillus chryseolinea norank f env ops 17 and truepera within the soil bacterial community some studies have suggested that haliangium is a beneficial rhizosphere bacterium ling et al 2014 in addition lysobacter and chryseolinea secrete large amounts of organic carbon metabolizing enzymes de bruijn et al 2015 kim et al 2013 and norank f norank o saccharimonadales increases the soil available phosphorus content mason et al 2021 moreover olb13 prefers carbon compounds song et al 2020 and rhodanobacter requires considerable amounts of energy for denitrification heuvel et al 2010 bacillus norank f env ops 17 and truepera have been reported to be involved in soil nitrogen fixation denitrification and nitrification huang et al 2019 saxena et al 2020 yin et al 2019 moreover in the present study adi significantly promoted root forks table 1 which increased the number of root soil interactions and affected soil biochemical processes the last two reasons may be attributable to the differences in the co2 and n2o emission trends in addition the separation degree of the soil co2 and n2o emissions curves decreased as the lower irrigation limits increased supplementary fig 1 this decrease may be due to the different frequencies and intensities of the alternating dry wet soil produced by the different irrigation treatments these changes could have varying effects on soil biochemical processes however the underlying mechanism requires further study 4 2 adi increases cumulative soil co2 emissions the different water supply methods mdi and adi resulted in different total cumulative co2 fluxes specifically the total cumulative co2 fluxes were significantly greater under adi than under conventional mdi unlike conventional mdi adi involves frequent soil wetting drying alternations sánchez martín et al 2008 therefore adi favors soil mineralization microbial activity and soil co2 fluxes borken and matzner 2009 li et al 2011 in the present study correlation analysis revealed that the cumulative co2 emissions were significantly positively correlated with root forks root volume and the abundance of certain genera of microorganisms such as haliangium lysobacter and rhodanobacter in addition increased root forks and relative abundance of these microorganisms resulting from adi increase soil respiration biasi et al 2014 and the availability and uptake of various micronutrients in the rhizosphere these factors not only improve the physiology of plant microbe interactions kumar et al 2016 but also increase the cumulative soil co2 emissions with different lower irrigation limits adi led to differences in wetted areas wetting drying alternation frequencies soil temperature and soil porosity buyanovsky et al 1986 sanchez martin et al 2008 these changes could further exacerbate differences in microenvironment moisture nutrient concentrations and plant root growth these differences could ultimately affect soil gas emission fluxes in the present study the number of root forks was significantly greater under the adi treatments with 50 and 70 field capacity than under the adi treatment with 60 field capacity table 1 moreover the cumulative soil co2 emissions under adi50 and adi70 were 11 3 and 15 0 greater than those under adi60 table 3 respectively the soil water content was relatively low when the lower irrigation limit was 50 field capacity and the resulting high frequency of wetting drying alternations and the stress caused by water deficit promoted tomato root growth and the soil dissolved organic carbon contents table 1 these results are consistent with those of a previous study sharp et al 2004 however the root forks and soil dissolved organic carbon significantly affected the relative abundance of some genera within the bacterial and fungal communities supplementary figs 2 and 3 these factors in turn increase root soil interactions and soil nutrient acquisition troy et al 2013 furthermore the enhancement of biochemical reactions in soil metabolism requires more energy and increases soil carbon consumption xiang et al 2008 ultimately increasing soil co2 emissions the wetting drying alternation frequency decreased as irrigation increased however the adi with a lower limit of 70 field capacity significantly promoted an increase in cumulative soil co2 emissions increased soil water content also promotes root growth ismail et al 2008 and further enhances microbial activity and root soil interactions resulting in increased soil gas emissions kuzyakov 2002 kuzyakov and xu 2013 under adi60 the wetting drying alternation frequency was lower than that under adi50 and the soil water content was lower than that under adi70 the number of root forks decreased under adi60 compared with adi50 and adi70 table 1 accordingly adi60 reduced root soil interactions therefore the cumulative soil co2 emissions under adi60 were also significantly lower than those under adi50 and adi70 4 3 both relative water deficit and an adequate adi increase cumulative soil n2o emissions different water supply methods mdi and adi also resulted in different total cumulative n2o fluxes in this study the total cumulative n2o fluxes under adi at 50 and 70 field capacity were significantly greater than those under mdi and adi60 additionally the cumulative emissions of soil n2o were significantly positively correlated with bacterial community aces stepwise regression led to the following formula cumulative emissions of soil n2o 0 95 bacterial community ace 0 21 fungal community ace 0 56 p 0 021 both relative water deficit at a lower irrigation limit of 50 and adequate water supply at a lower irrigation limit of 70 were found to promote not only the number of root forks but also bacterial community aces these two factors may promote the root soil interaction and further accelerate the cycling of available nitrogen and soil n2o emissions in soils however the two treatments may have had different effects adi50 involved frequent wetting drying alternations in the field which can affect or even damage soil aggregates decrease soil porosity table 1 and increase anoxia these changes in the soil microenvironment could increase nutrient and microbial activities that are difficult to induce troy et al 2013 in turn these changes could promote denitrification and soil n2o emissions guo et al 2014 under adi70 the wetting drying alternation frequency of the soils was lower and the soil moisture content was the greatest as a result adi70 further decreased the soil permeability and reduced damage to soil aggregates these changes are beneficial to the growth of related bacteria that decompose organic matter mocali et al 2013 thereby promoting n2o emissions in addition adi50 and adi70 increased soil co2 emissions which suggests that soil carbon metabolism increased table 1 interactions between carbon metabolism and nitrogen metabolism might also promote the latter increasing soil n2o generation and emissions under adi60 the wetting drying alternation frequency was lower than that under adi50 additionally the soil water content was lower under ad160 than under adi70 these differences may have caused decreases in the number of root fork and bacterial community aces under adi60 compared with adi50 and adi70 furthermore the weaker root soil interactions under adi60 resulted in 70 9 and 35 7 lower cumulative soil n2o emissions compared with those roots under adi50 and adi70 table 3 respectively 4 4 trade off between irrigation and soil gas emissions under adi in agricultural production adi significantly improves water use efficiency yang et al 2013 and increases plant yields du et al 2017 yang et al 2012 this is consistent with our experimental results however the results of the present study showed that the adi also significantly increased soil greenhouse gas emissions han et al 2017 reported that conventional drip irrigation with moderate irrigation volumes could significantly reduce soil n2o emissions which is also partly consistent with the results of this study compared with adi with low and high irrigation volumes adi50 and adi70 and conventional drip irrigation mdi adi with moderate irrigation volumes maintained the balance among water use efficiency tomato yield and yield scaled soil gas emissions relatively well table 1 these results are useful for addressing the trade off between irrigation and soil gas emissions but are far from sufficient thus to improve drip irrigation technology optimize irrigation systems and promote the healthy development of cea the effects of adi on the environment and its related mechanisms should be studied in depth for example some genera of soil microorganisms were significantly associated with soil gas emissions under both water management conditions in this study figs 5 and 6 in the future soil microbial communities may be regulated through reasonable irrigation management practices and targeted use of microbial fertilizers to ultimately achieve the dual purpose of reducing soil gas emissions and improving plant growth 5 conclusions adi under different lower limits of irrigation differentially affected the root growth and soil microbial community composition resulting in differences in root soil interactions and soil gas emissions adi treatments involving a relative water deficit a lower limit of 50 field capacity and an adequate water supply a lower limit of 70 field capacity promoted tomato root fork numbers and bacterial community aces significantly increased root soil interactions and increased cumulative soil gas emissions the root soil interactions decreased under adi with a moderate irrigation level a lower limit of 60 field capacity because of a reduced number of root forks compared with that under adi with lower limits of 50 and 70 field capacity however these decreased interactions resulted in the lowest yield scaled soil gas emissions among the three adi treatments taken together these findings provide insights into the trade off between irrigation and soil gas emissions through adjustments in water management practices although further studies are needed declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known

9951,the lack of knowledge on the effects of alternating drip irrigation adi on soil gas emissions limits the understanding of the trade off between irrigation and soil gas emissions to determine the effects of adi on soil gas emissions this study investigated soil gas emissions microbial community composition and root soil interactions in a tomato crop under adi with different lower limits 50 60 and 70 field capacity fc with mulched drip irrigation mdi used as a control adi with different lower limits differentially affected root growth and microbial community composition these differences regulated root soil interactions and affected soil gas emissions compared with adi at 60 fc adi at 50 and 70 fc increased root fork numbers by 14 7 and 26 5 respectively and compared with mdi and adi at 60 fc these treatments also increased the abundance based coverage estimators of bacterial communities furthermore the total cumulative co2 emissions from adi at 50 and 70 fc were 42 1 and 46 8 greater than that of mdi respectively and the total cumulative n2o emissions from both treatments were 70 0 and 35 0 greater than those under mdi respectively compared with mdi adi at 60 fc increased the total cumulative co2 flux by 27 7 although the latter decreased the root fork numbers and abundance based coverage estimators of bacterial communities importantly the tomato yield and water use efficiency under adi at 60 fc were intermediate for the various treatments and the yield scaled soil gas emissions were significantly lower than those under adi at 50 and 70 fc therefore adi at 60 fc is a suitable irrigation method for optimizing tomato crop water use efficiency and reducing gas emissions taken together these results provide a new perspective for reducing soil gas emissions based on regulating the soil microbial community and root soil interaction mechanisms through soil water management keywords alternating drip irrigation soil co2 soil n2o soil microbial community root zone soil 1 introduction agroecosystems are relatively fragile and can be easily disturbed by natural factors and agricultural management practices such as farming fertilization and irrigation lal 2004 inevitably agroecosystems are an important source of greenhouse gas emissions co2 and n2o emissions from farmlands account for 25 and 60 respectively of anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions ipcc 2007 with societal and economic development controlled environment agriculture cea has become an important agronomic practice for example the total cea planting area in china reached approximately 4 million hectares in 2014 cea soil is an important source of greenhouse gas emissions because of the large amount of fertilizer input and the high frequency of irrigation chen et al 2004 yun cai et al 2012 therefore cea water management optimization is important for reducing soil greenhouse gas emissions soil greenhouse gases originate mainly from plant roots and soil microbial respiration biasi et al 2014 chen et al 2015 plant root biomass and architecture are governed mainly by soil moisture content the spatial distribution of soil particles and soil nutrients differences in root growth not only directly affect root soil respiration but also indirectly regulate microbial respiration by regulating root soil microbe interactions soil microbes i e bacteria and fungi can promote plant root growth by increasing the availability of nutrients such as carbon nitrogen and phosphorus affecting the carbon and nitrogen cycles ye et al 2018 and soil greenhouse gas emissions rashid et al 2016 moreover soil microbial activity is closely related to community composition which is affected by root morphology and activity under different soil moisture contents and spatial distributions in water scarce areas drip irrigation an efficient water conservation measure has been widely used in cea hou et al 2010 the ongoing promotion of drip irrigation has led to different developments such as mulched drip irrigation mdi underground drip irrigation root area based alternating drip irrigation adi and deficit drip irrigation various drip irrigation methods can cause substantial differences in the soil environment phogat et al 2016 rodrigues et al 2013 topak et al 2016 which can cause substantial amounts of soil gas emissions mdi accelerates the wetting drying alternation in the root zone thereby significantly affecting the temporal and spatial heterogeneity of soil temperature moisture and porosity hou et al 2010 khalil and baggs 2005 and enhancing plant root activity assouline et al 2006 microbial activity neilsen et al 2014 soil respiration and greenhouse gas emissions several studies have shown that compared with flood irrigation mdi results in less soil evaporation and soil co2 flux li et al 2011 in addition compared with furrow irrigation mdi uses less water but causes substantial changes in the wetted soil area sánchez martín et al 2008 thus reducing n2o emissions while greatly improving water efficiency kennedy et al 2013 wang et al 2016 adi in which the soil on both sides of the root system alternates between dry and wet conditions was developed on the basis of mdi ahmadi et al 2014 many studies have shown that compared with mdi adi can substantially improve plant water use efficiency without reducing plant yields shu et al 2020 one reason is that adi not only can improve microbial activity wang et al 2008 but also can alter microbial community composition and increase the abundance of nitrogen and phosphorus metabolizing microbiota wang et al 2017 another reason is that the frequent alternation of wetting and drying in root zone caused by adi improves root activity and root length liu et al 2020 under adi changes in microbial community composition and root growth can further affect the root soil microbe interaction and thus affect greenhouse gas emissions this occurs because most of the soil respiration is due to populations of nitrifying and denitrifying bacteria and fungi zhao et al 2011 previous studies have shown that the dry and wet soil cycles generated by adi can stimulate the mineralization of soil organic carbon and nitrogen and promote plant absorption of these two elements however adi may also lead to greater soil carbon and nitrogen loss sun et al 2013 compared with drip irrigation alternate furrow irrigation was reported to reduce soil co2 emissions by 14 qin et al 2018 however few studies have investigated greenhouse gas emissions under adi and even fewer studies have explored the relationships between greenhouse gas emissions and microbial community composition and root growth furthermore studies on soil greenhouse gas emissions under mdi and adi are scarce this lack of information limits the in depth understanding of the impact of adi on greenhouse gas emissions and restricts the optimization and improvement of adi and related drip irrigation technology i e mdi in turn the ability to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and further improve the efficient use of water and soil resources in cea is hindered therefore to elucidate the mechanism through which adi affects greenhouse gas emissions adi must be studied from the perspective of its effects on soil microbial community changes and root soil microbe interactions in addition intense agricultural practices under cea require a trade off between irrigation and soil gas emissions to achieve increased yields previous studies have attempted to balance the direct relationship between soil gas emissions irrigation volume and tomato yield by adopting aerated irrigation chen et al 2018 to balance soil n2o emissions and n use efficiency by adjusting soil tillage methods kong et al 2009 and to reduce soil gas emissions by decreasing the irrigation volume and optimizing irrigation methods fawibe et al 2019 han et al 2017 however what is the trade off between irrigation and soil gas emissions under adi there is currently no definitive answer from this perspective determining the internal mechanism of the effects of adi on soil gas emissions is urgently needed one assumption is that differences in the plant root zone caused by adi under different soil moisture contents would result in differences in root growth and soil microbial composition compared with those under mdi regulate root soil microbe interactions and ultimately affect greenhouse gas emissions in this study the effects of adi on soil co2 and n2o emissions tomato root growth and soil bacterial and fungal community composition and diversity in a greenhouse setting were evaluated conventional mdi served as a control interactions among soil environmental factors microorganisms and greenhouse gases were studied to analyze the internal mechanism of the effects of adi on soil greenhouse emissions the results serve as a reference for the rational application of drip irrigation and improving irrigation systems 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental design this experiment was executed from october 2018 to may 2019 in a greenhouse 108 m 8 m in yangling shaanxi province the soil bulk density was 1 4 g cm 3 and the field capacity was 28 2 mass water content the soil is a brown lou soil with an organic matter content of 16 5 g kg 1 a phosphorus content of 0 4 g kg 1 a nitrogen content of 1 0 g kg 1 and a potassium content of 10 4 g kg 1 the test plant species was tomato the greenhouse space was divided into different plots with two ridges in each plot the cross section of each plot was in the shape of a trapezoid with a length of 6 0 m height of 0 2 m top width of 0 6 m and bottom width of 0 3 m seventeen plants were cultivated in each row at a spacing of 0 35 m separate rows were established on both sides of each plot conventional mdi was used as the control the drip irrigation tube was located directly between the two rows the upper and lower limits of irrigation were 80 and 70 field capacity respectively three adi treatments adi50 adi60 and adi70 were established with upper irrigation limits of 60 70 and 80 field capacity respectively and lower limits of 50 60 and 70 field capacity respectively another drip irrigation tube was placed 40 cm from the plant roots at both ends of each plot for each irrigation event the irrigation tube at only one end of the planting plot was turned on and the other end was turned on during the next session thus irrigation alternated between the two ends each treatment was replicated three times for a total of 12 plots all the plots were covered with 0 014 mm thick white plastic film manufactured at the xinfeng plastic factory china the drip irrigation tube had a diameter of 16 mm a wall thickness of 0 3 mm and drip holes at every 30 cm the working pressure and drip flow were 0 1 mpa and 1 5 l h 1 respectively soil moisture was measured by a tdr 200 soil moisture meter spectrum usa for this three probe tubes were installed at a depth of 100 cm in each mdi plot and at each end of the adi plots the moisture contents were measured every 10 cm and the values were corrected by soil drilling and the oven drying method bittelli et al 2008 eller and denoth 1996 the soil moisture content was measured every 3 5 days according to the plant growth conditions and measurements were performed before and after each irrigation event when the soil moisture content under mdi or on the wet side under adi reached the lower limit moisture was applied in accordance with the irrigation formula supplementary formula 1 assuming a 40 cm thick wet soil layer during the experimental period the irrigation volumes under mdi adi50 adi60 and adi704 were 290 0 219 3 251 6 and 280 2 mm respectively as shown in supplementary table 1 the tomato water requirements under mdi adi50 adi60 and adi704 were 281 2 210 4 245 1 and 274 0 mm respectively as calculated according to supplementary formula 2 oweis et al 2011 therefore the water requirements of tomato under each treatment were satisfied during the experiment adi50 underwent 13 irrigation cycles 9 cycles in the flowering and fruit set period and four cycles in the fruit maturation period adi60 underwent nine irrigation cycles six cycles in the flowering and fruit set period and three cycles in the fruit maturation period and adi70 underwent seven irrigation cycles five cycles in the flowering and fruit set period and two cycles in the fruit maturation period supplementary table 1 2 2 indicator measurements 2 2 1 soil temperature dissolved organic carbon no3 n and porosity ground thermometers were placed with the 0 25 cm soil layer at 5 cm intervals in the front middle and back of each plot to measure soil temperature measurements were taken every 5 days at 10 00 am the average soil temperature c during the tomato growing period was subsequently calculated at 40 90 and 130 days after transplanting three soil samples were collected from the tomato root zone via the digging method in each treatment the contents of soil dissolved organic carbon and soil no3 n were determined by a continuous flow analyzer and the mean values during the growth period were calculated wang et al 2016 after harvesting three sampling points were selected in each planted groove in an s shape soil samples were collected throughout the 0 40 cm soil profile at 10 cm intervals with a ring knife 100 cm3 and returned to the laboratory for drying and soil bulk density measurements the bulk density was calculated according to supplementary formula 3 the soil porosity was calculated on the basis of the soil bulk density according to supplementary formula 4 2 2 2 tomato root system three representative plants with uniform growth per plot were selected and labeled when the fruits were ripe root samples of labeled plants were subsequently collected by removing the entire root system to the midline between two adjacent plants within a rectangular area 40 cm 30 cm the digging depth was the same as the actual root depth approximately 50 cm fig 1 root samples were returned to the laboratory soaked in water and then rinsed with water to separate soil particles the length area and other properties of clean roots were determined via a root analysis system 2 2 3 soil bacterial and fungal communities the soils in the root zone of the plants in each treatment were collected by digging methods in 1 2 2 these soils were then used for determining the soil bacterial and fungal community compositions and the diversity indices via high throughput sequencing as described in the supplementary methods 2 2 4 soil greenhouse gases soil co2 and n2o gases were collected in situ via the static black box method the static box used was custom made on the basis of the experimental needs the box consisted of two parts namely a base and a box which were composed of 1 mm thick stainless steel plates the dimensions of the outer box were 40 cm 40 cm 50 cm length width height respectively and the dimensions of the inner box were 35 cm 35 cm 50 cm length width height respectively the outer surface of the box was wrapped with foam and reflective film for insulation a small fan was installed inside the box for mixing during gas collection and as a sampling port a three way valve was installed at the bottom of the box the dimensions of the base were 40 cm 40 cm 5 cm length width height respectively and the base had a 3 cm wide groove and a ground wedge 10 cm long at each corner after the plants were transplanted the base was installed in the plot such that the base touched the soil and the upper edge of the groove was located at ground level the base remained fixed during plant growth to avoid any soil disturbance during gas collection the base groove was filled with water and then embedded into the box forming a closed collection box soil gases were collected every 10 days from november 10 2019 until tomato harvest after the box was sealed the fan was turned on for 1 min to mix the gases in the box which was marked as time 0 the soil gases were collected using a 50 ml medical syringe at 15 min intervals for 45 min at the time of sampling the temperature inside the box was measured with a thermometer installed on top of the box and the air temperature was measured using a thermometer 1 5 m above the soil surface the soil gases were analyzed with a gas chromatography system agilent usa specifically the co2 was analyzed with a flame ionization detector fid with column and detector temperatures of 80 and 200 c respectively for co2 analysis the carrier fuel and combustion supporting gas were nitrogen hydrogen and air at flow rates of 40 35 and 350 ml min 1 respectively n2o was analyzed with an electron capture detector ecd with a column temperature of 80 c and a detector temperature of 320 c the carrier gas was argon methane at a flow rate of 30 ml min 1 the gas emission flux was calculated according to the following equation f ρ h 273 273 t d c d t where f ρ h t and d c d t are the gas emission flux mg m 2 h 1 gas density kg m 3 sampling box height m temperature inside the box and gas rate ml m 3 h 1 respectively the cumulative emissions of soil gas co2 or n2o were calculated according to the following formula m i n f i 1 f i 2 t i 1 t i 24 10 2 where m f i and t are the cumulative emissions of soil gas co2 or n2o kg ha 1 gas flux mg m 2 h 1 the ith measurement and number of days after tomato transplanting when the soil gas was sampled respectively 2 2 5 tomato yield irrigation water use efficiency and yield scaled soil gas emissions tomato fruits were harvested according to the different experimental treatments and the yield t ha 1 was calculated accordingly irrigation water use efficiency iwue kg m 3 was calculated according to the equation iwue y i where y is the tomato fruit yield per treatment and i is the total amount of irrigation water per treatment ouyang et al 2021 yield scaled soil gas emissions were calculated by the following formula li et al 2020 y s m y 1000 where ys is the yield scaled soil co2 or n2o emissions ys co2 or ys n2o mg kg 1 m is the cumulative soil gas emissions co2 or n2o kg ha 1 and y is the tomato fruit yield t ha 1 2 3 data processing the data were organized and analyzed by microsoft excel and spss 22 0 ibm armonk ny usa respectively analyses of normality and homogeneity were performed together with one way anova via duncan s method p 0 05 in addition pearson s correlations were used to analyze correlations among soil environmental factors microorganisms and greenhouse gases 3 results 3 1 effects of adi on average soil temperature porosity and root growth as shown in table 1 compared with adi50 adi70 increased the average soil temperature by 11 3 significant differences in porosity were detected at various depths among the different irrigation methods and different lower limits of adi the porosity at 0 20 cm under adi70 was significantly greater 14 0 24 2 and 5 6 than that under mdi adi50 and adi60 respectively compared with mdi adi50 adi60 and adi70 increased the soil dissolved organic carbon contents by 97 8 41 4 and 81 9 respectively and adi50 adi60 and adi70 improved the soil no3 n contents by 1 4 2 8 and 1 6 times respectively in addition compared with mdi adi50 and adi70 increased the root volume by 41 8 and 35 2 respectively and adi50 and adi70 increased the root fork numbers by 2 6 and 2 9 times respectively the root forks under adi60 were 2 3 times greater than those under mdi 3 2 effects of adi on soil bacterial and fungal communities compared with those under mdi the numbers of bacterial dna sequences under adi50 and adi70 increased by 60 4 and 62 1 respectively but the number under adi60 decreased by 10 8 table 2 compared with mdi and adi60 both adi50 and adi70 significantly increased the abundance abundance based coverage estimator ace index of the bacterial communities bacteria with a relative abundance greater than 1 in a community were analyzed at the genus level conventional mdi and adi resulted in increases in the relative abundance of different bacteria fig 2 for example mdi led to pseudomonas abundance values that were 12 3 15 2 and 5 2 times greater than those resulting from adi50 adi60 and adi70 respectively flavobacterium abundance values that were 6 1 7 7 and 1 3 times greater than those resulting from adi50 adi60 and adi70 respectively and acinetobacter abundance values that were 454 6 150 0 and 13 6 times greater than those resulting from adi50 adi60 and adi70 respectively however adi50 adi60 and adi70 led to rhodanobacter abundance values that were 7 3 9 0 and 17 3 times greater respectively than that under mdi tm7 abundance values that were 72 1 5 9 and 4 3 times greater respectively than that under mdi luteimonas abundance values that were 2 2 4 0 and 3 1 times greater respectively than that under mdi and truepera abundance values that were 5 1 2 0 and 2 2 times greater respectively than that under mdi in addition compared with mdi adi50 adi60 and adi70 led to 140 2 81 3 and 67 9 increases respectively in bacillus abundance compared with those under adi50 adi50 and adi70 the fungal dna sequences under mdi increased by 21 5 21 5 and 7 3 respectively compared with adi50 and adi60 both mdi and adi70 significantly increased the ace of fungal communities the shannon indices of the fungal communities among the four treatments significantly differed with the largest value under adi70 the fungal community compositions were evaluated on the basis of major fungal genera with relative abundance levels greater than 1 fig 3 in the fungal community under mdi the top three fungal genera were unclassified o pleosporales 27 8 verticillium 24 4 and norank p mucoromycota 13 3 the top three fungal genera under adi50 were unclassified o pleosporales 37 5 chaetomium 17 3 and verticillium 11 4 however those under adi60 were verticillium 27 3 chaetomium 17 1 and unclassified o microascales 9 9 and those under adi70 were chaetomium 21 9 unclassified p ascomycota 16 7 and unclassified o pleosporales 14 9 the fungal community under mdi presented norank p mucoromycota abundance values that were 1 9 2 2 and 5 7 times greater than those under adi50 adi60 and adi70 respectively and nuclearia abundance values that were 4 3 3 0 and 2 8 times greater than those under adi50 adi60 and adi70 respectively however adi50 adi60 and adi70 led to unclassified f norank o agaricales abundance values that were 3 1 3 4 and 9 7 times greater than those resulting from mdi respectively 3 3 effects of adi on soil gas emissions the trends of soil co2 emission fluxes during the flowering and fruit set period and the fruit maturation period under the four treatments were similar fig 4 however the numbers of emission peaks and time nodes differed significantly mdi produced three emission peaks the main peak occurred 90 days after transplanting and two minor peaks occurred 60 and 120 days after tomato transplanting adi50 and adi70 produced two emission peaks the main peak occurred 70 days after transplanting and a minor peak occurred 120 days after transplanting adi60 produced three emission peaks the main peak occurred 70 days after transplanting and two minor peaks occurred 90 and 120 days after transplanting compared with those under mdi the cumulative co2 fluxes during the flowering and fruit set period under adi50 adi60 and adi70 increased by 49 3 42 3 and 79 9 respectively similarly the cumulative co2 fluxes during the same period under adi70 increased by 20 5 and 26 4 compared with those under adi50 and adi60 respectively the cumulative co2 flux during the fruit maturation period under adi50 was 1 3 times greater than that under mdi whereas the cumulative co2 flux under adi70 was 25 2 lower than that under mdi the total cumulative co2 fluxes under adi50 and adi70 did not significantly differ but were 42 1 and 46 8 greater respectively than those under mdi moreover the total cumulative co2 flux under adi60 was 27 7 greater than that under mdi table 3 fig 4 shows that the trends of n2o emission fluxes under the different treatments during the flowering and fruit set the fruit maturation periods differed and that the numbers of peaks and time nodes differed significantly mdi produced two emission peaks the main peak occurred 90 days after transplanting and a minor peak occurred 120 days after transplanting adi50 and adi70 produced two emission peaks the main peak occurred 60 days after transplanting and a minor peak occurred 90 days after transplanting adi60 produced one emissions peak 60 days after transplanting and the flux first increased but then decreased no significant difference in the cumulative n2o emission flux was observed between the adi50 and adi70 treatments during the flowering and fruit set period whereas the cumulative n2o emission fluxes under adi50 and adi70 were 2 3 and 2 1 times greater respectively than that under mdi and the differences were significant the cumulative soil n2o emission fluxes during the fruit maturation period under mdi and adi50 were significantly greater than those under adi60 and adi70 and the cumulative soil n2o emission fluxes during the same period under adi60 and adi70 were 61 6 and 51 6 lower respectively than that under mdi the total n2o emissions under adi50 were 70 0 greater than those under mdi and adi60 and the total n2o emissions under adi70 were 35 0 greater than those under adi60 and mdi table 3 comparative analysis of the soil co2 and n2o emission trends revealed that the co2 and n2o emission curves under mdi exhibited similar trends and emission peak times whereas those under adi50 adi60 and adi70 exhibited significantly different trends and emission peak times supplementary fig 1 under mdi the soil co2 emissions changed significantly faster than did the soil n2o emissions within 50 70 days after transplanting however the soil n2o emissions changed significantly faster than the soil co2 emissions under adi50 adi60 and adi70 within 110 130 days after transplanting the soil n2o emissions changed significantly faster than the soil co2 emissions did under mdi however the soil co2 emissions changed significantly faster than the soil n2o emissions did under adi50 adi60 and adi70 3 4 correlation analysis correlation analysis revealed that the cumulative soil co2 emissions were significantly positively correlated with the number of root forks and volume however the cumulative emissions of soil n2o were significantly and positively correlated with the bacterial community ace table 4 furthermore the relationships among cumulative soil gas emissions tomato root growth the soil bacterial community index and the soil fungal community index were analyzed by stepwise regression the results of which are described via the following formulas 1 cumulative emissions of soil co2 1 04 root forks 0 13 0 10 cm soil porosity 40 06 p 0 004 and 2 cumulative emissions of soil n2o 0 95 bacterial community ace 0 21 fungal community ace 0 56 p 0 021 the correlations between the major species composing the soil bacterial communities at the genus level and cumulative soil gas emissions were determined fig 5 the cumulative co2 fluxes were significantly positively correlated with abundance of haliangium lysobacter norank f a4b norank f microscillaceae norank f norank o saccharimonadales olb13 and rhodanobacter the cumulative n2o fluxes were significantly positively correlated with the abundance of bacillus chryseolinea iamia norank f akyg1722 norank f env ops 17 norank f gemmatimonadaceae norank f jg30 kf cm45 norank f norank o norank c alphaproteobacteria orank f norank o norank c gitt gs 136 norank f norank o s085 norank f norank o sbr1031 and truepera similarly correlations between the major species composing the soil fungal communities at the genus level and cumulative soil gas emissions were also determined fig 6 the cumulative co2 fluxes were negatively correlated with the abundance of norank f colpodea and unclassified o hypocreales however the cumulative n2o fluxes were negatively correlated with the abundance of norank f pyronemataceae and verticillium and significantly positively correlated with that of unclassified d eukaryota 3 5 effects of adi on tomato yield irrigation volume iwue and yield scaled soil gas emissions compared with those under mdi the tomato yields under adi60 and adi70 significantly increased by 3 7 and 13 1 respectively however the tomato yield under adi50 decreased by 6 3 table 5 compared with those under adi50 and adi60 the irrigation volumes under mdi significantly increased by 32 2 and 15 3 respectively but did not significantly differ from those under adi70 on the other hand compared with that under mdi iwue under adi50 adi60 and adi70 significantly increased by 43 9 20 3 and 19 1 respectively adi50 not only caused ys co2 levels to be 1 5 1 2 and 1 2 times greater respectively than those under mdi adi60 and adi70 but also caused ys n2o levels to be 1 8 1 9 and 1 5 times greater respectively than those under mdi adi60 and adi70 ys co2 and ys n2o under adi70 were significantly lower than those under adi50 but were 30 0 and 21 7 greater respectively than those under mdi although ys co2 under adi60 was greater than that under mdi the ys n2o levels were the same under adi60 and mdi 4 discussion 4 1 compared with mdi adi results in different co2 and n2o emission trends soil co2 emissions originate primarily from plant root and microbial respiration biasi et al 2014 chen et al 2015 on the other hand soil n2o emissions are derived mainly from microbial nitrification and denitrification kennedy et al 2013 sánchez martín et al 2008 wang et al 2016 soil moisture is the limiting factor for both plant root and soil microbial growth irrigation in cea is frequent and intensive different water supply methods mdi and adi can substantially differentially affect various soil abiotic factors such as water availability gas heat distribution and porosity assouline 2002 khalil and baggs 2005 wang et al 2000 furthermore variations in soil environmental factors can affect the growth of both microbes and plant roots assouline et al 2006 neilsen et al 2014 the results of the present study showed that compared with mdi adi not only significantly increased the soil porosity with a depth of 0 20 cm soil dissolved organic carbon levels and soil no3 n levels table 1 but also significantly altered the composition of soil bacterial and fungal communities figs 2 and 3 thus these irrigation methods inevitably affect both soil co2 and n2o generation and emissions liu et al 2012 the soil co2 and n2o emissions in the greenhouse exhibited patterns that significantly differed between conventional mdi and adi the soil co2 and n2o emission curves under mdi tended to be similar and peaked at the same time compared with those under conventional mdi however the co2 and n2o emission curves under adi exhibited significantly different trends and peaked at significantly different times i e the main emission peak occurred earlier supplementary fig 1 in addition most cumulative co2 and n2o emissions under adi were due to peaks at 70 and 60 days respectively but these peaks were delayed under mdi these differences may be due to the increased alternating dry wet frequency during the flowering and fruit set period compared with the fruit maturation period caused by adi in the root zone frequent alternating drying wetting cycles are conducive to nutrient release by soil particles and increased soil microbial activity the results of the present experiment showed that compared with mdi adi significantly increased the relative abundance of haliangium lysobacter norank f norank o saccharimonadales olb13 rhodanobacter bacillus chryseolinea norank f env ops 17 and truepera within the soil bacterial community some studies have suggested that haliangium is a beneficial rhizosphere bacterium ling et al 2014 in addition lysobacter and chryseolinea secrete large amounts of organic carbon metabolizing enzymes de bruijn et al 2015 kim et al 2013 and norank f norank o saccharimonadales increases the soil available phosphorus content mason et al 2021 moreover olb13 prefers carbon compounds song et al 2020 and rhodanobacter requires considerable amounts of energy for denitrification heuvel et al 2010 bacillus norank f env ops 17 and truepera have been reported to be involved in soil nitrogen fixation denitrification and nitrification huang et al 2019 saxena et al 2020 yin et al 2019 moreover in the present study adi significantly promoted root forks table 1 which increased the number of root soil interactions and affected soil biochemical processes the last two reasons may be attributable to the differences in the co2 and n2o emission trends in addition the separation degree of the soil co2 and n2o emissions curves decreased as the lower irrigation limits increased supplementary fig 1 this decrease may be due to the different frequencies and intensities of the alternating dry wet soil produced by the different irrigation treatments these changes could have varying effects on soil biochemical processes however the underlying mechanism requires further study 4 2 adi increases cumulative soil co2 emissions the different water supply methods mdi and adi resulted in different total cumulative co2 fluxes specifically the total cumulative co2 fluxes were significantly greater under adi than under conventional mdi unlike conventional mdi adi involves frequent soil wetting drying alternations sánchez martín et al 2008 therefore adi favors soil mineralization microbial activity and soil co2 fluxes borken and matzner 2009 li et al 2011 in the present study correlation analysis revealed that the cumulative co2 emissions were significantly positively correlated with root forks root volume and the abundance of certain genera of microorganisms such as haliangium lysobacter and rhodanobacter in addition increased root forks and relative abundance of these microorganisms resulting from adi increase soil respiration biasi et al 2014 and the availability and uptake of various micronutrients in the rhizosphere these factors not only improve the physiology of plant microbe interactions kumar et al 2016 but also increase the cumulative soil co2 emissions with different lower irrigation limits adi led to differences in wetted areas wetting drying alternation frequencies soil temperature and soil porosity buyanovsky et al 1986 sanchez martin et al 2008 these changes could further exacerbate differences in microenvironment moisture nutrient concentrations and plant root growth these differences could ultimately affect soil gas emission fluxes in the present study the number of root forks was significantly greater under the adi treatments with 50 and 70 field capacity than under the adi treatment with 60 field capacity table 1 moreover the cumulative soil co2 emissions under adi50 and adi70 were 11 3 and 15 0 greater than those under adi60 table 3 respectively the soil water content was relatively low when the lower irrigation limit was 50 field capacity and the resulting high frequency of wetting drying alternations and the stress caused by water deficit promoted tomato root growth and the soil dissolved organic carbon contents table 1 these results are consistent with those of a previous study sharp et al 2004 however the root forks and soil dissolved organic carbon significantly affected the relative abundance of some genera within the bacterial and fungal communities supplementary figs 2 and 3 these factors in turn increase root soil interactions and soil nutrient acquisition troy et al 2013 furthermore the enhancement of biochemical reactions in soil metabolism requires more energy and increases soil carbon consumption xiang et al 2008 ultimately increasing soil co2 emissions the wetting drying alternation frequency decreased as irrigation increased however the adi with a lower limit of 70 field capacity significantly promoted an increase in cumulative soil co2 emissions increased soil water content also promotes root growth ismail et al 2008 and further enhances microbial activity and root soil interactions resulting in increased soil gas emissions kuzyakov 2002 kuzyakov and xu 2013 under adi60 the wetting drying alternation frequency was lower than that under adi50 and the soil water content was lower than that under adi70 the number of root forks decreased under adi60 compared with adi50 and adi70 table 1 accordingly adi60 reduced root soil interactions therefore the cumulative soil co2 emissions under adi60 were also significantly lower than those under adi50 and adi70 4 3 both relative water deficit and an adequate adi increase cumulative soil n2o emissions different water supply methods mdi and adi also resulted in different total cumulative n2o fluxes in this study the total cumulative n2o fluxes under adi at 50 and 70 field capacity were significantly greater than those under mdi and adi60 additionally the cumulative emissions of soil n2o were significantly positively correlated with bacterial community aces stepwise regression led to the following formula cumulative emissions of soil n2o 0 95 bacterial community ace 0 21 fungal community ace 0 56 p 0 021 both relative water deficit at a lower irrigation limit of 50 and adequate water supply at a lower irrigation limit of 70 were found to promote not only the number of root forks but also bacterial community aces these two factors may promote the root soil interaction and further accelerate the cycling of available nitrogen and soil n2o emissions in soils however the two treatments may have had different effects adi50 involved frequent wetting drying alternations in the field which can affect or even damage soil aggregates decrease soil porosity table 1 and increase anoxia these changes in the soil microenvironment could increase nutrient and microbial activities that are difficult to induce troy et al 2013 in turn these changes could promote denitrification and soil n2o emissions guo et al 2014 under adi70 the wetting drying alternation frequency of the soils was lower and the soil moisture content was the greatest as a result adi70 further decreased the soil permeability and reduced damage to soil aggregates these changes are beneficial to the growth of related bacteria that decompose organic matter mocali et al 2013 thereby promoting n2o emissions in addition adi50 and adi70 increased soil co2 emissions which suggests that soil carbon metabolism increased table 1 interactions between carbon metabolism and nitrogen metabolism might also promote the latter increasing soil n2o generation and emissions under adi60 the wetting drying alternation frequency was lower than that under adi50 additionally the soil water content was lower under ad160 than under adi70 these differences may have caused decreases in the number of root fork and bacterial community aces under adi60 compared with adi50 and adi70 furthermore the weaker root soil interactions under adi60 resulted in 70 9 and 35 7 lower cumulative soil n2o emissions compared with those roots under adi50 and adi70 table 3 respectively 4 4 trade off between irrigation and soil gas emissions under adi in agricultural production adi significantly improves water use efficiency yang et al 2013 and increases plant yields du et al 2017 yang et al 2012 this is consistent with our experimental results however the results of the present study showed that the adi also significantly increased soil greenhouse gas emissions han et al 2017 reported that conventional drip irrigation with moderate irrigation volumes could significantly reduce soil n2o emissions which is also partly consistent with the results of this study compared with adi with low and high irrigation volumes adi50 and adi70 and conventional drip irrigation mdi adi with moderate irrigation volumes maintained the balance among water use efficiency tomato yield and yield scaled soil gas emissions relatively well table 1 these results are useful for addressing the trade off between irrigation and soil gas emissions but are far from sufficient thus to improve drip irrigation technology optimize irrigation systems and promote the healthy development of cea the effects of adi on the environment and its related mechanisms should be studied in depth for example some genera of soil microorganisms were significantly associated with soil gas emissions under both water management conditions in this study figs 5 and 6 in the future soil microbial communities may be regulated through reasonable irrigation management practices and targeted use of microbial fertilizers to ultimately achieve the dual purpose of reducing soil gas emissions and improving plant growth 5 conclusions adi under different lower limits of irrigation differentially affected the root growth and soil microbial community composition resulting in differences in root soil interactions and soil gas emissions adi treatments involving a relative water deficit a lower limit of 50 field capacity and an adequate water supply a lower limit of 70 field capacity promoted tomato root fork numbers and bacterial community aces significantly increased root soil interactions and increased cumulative soil gas emissions the root soil interactions decreased under adi with a moderate irrigation level a lower limit of 60 field capacity because of a reduced number of root forks compared with that under adi with lower limits of 50 and 70 field capacity however these decreased interactions resulted in the lowest yield scaled soil gas emissions among the three adi treatments taken together these findings provide insights into the trade off between irrigation and soil gas emissions through adjustments in water management practices although further studies are needed declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known

9952,water scarcity is a significant global challenge water resources planning and management are vital to all sectors primarily for the agricultural sector identified as a significant consumer conjunctive water use management is ideal for decreasing water scarcity especially in arid and semiarid regions more importantly considering uncertainties in water management is critical to planning and management issues this study develops a fuzzy optimization model aiming at a qualitative quantitative conjunctive reallocation of reclaimed wastewater and groundwater resources three objectives including maximizing economic benefit minimizing fertilizer consumption and groundwater withdrawal were assessed in iran s varamin irrigation network this research uses fuzzy and non fuzzy optimization models for a quantitative qualitative conjunctive use of reclaimed wastewater and groundwater to meet multi objective functions these single and multi objective fuzzy and non fuzzy optimization models are compared the particle swarm optimization pso and multi objective pso mopso algorithms optimized single and multi objective problems a fuzzy optimization model is superior to the non fuzzy optimization model regarding optimizing multi objective functions the results indicated that the net benefit increased up to 16 without increasing the cultivated area in the fuzzy mopso model moreover groundwater withdrawal was reduced by using a larger share of reclaimed wastewater in total water consumption this increased the use of potential nitrate in reclaimed wastewater and reduced fertilizer consumption this study highlights achieving socio economic and environmental goals under uncertain circumstances using agricultural water strategies through reclaimed wastewater also a general improvement in water consumption efficiency was achieved through the optimal cropping pattern keywords conjunctive reallocation environmental sustainability fuzzy optimization mopso algorithm multi objective function 1 introduction water scarcity is a globally daunting challenge that has gradually increased competition between different water consumption sectors as the largest water consumer agriculture is facing this challenge and is under pressure due to increasing food demand thus needs a long term solution hashemy et al 2018 li et al 2017 reclaimed wastewater has been proposed as an effective solution for water scarcity particularly for irrigation tayebikhorami et al 2020 the use of this potential source increases farmers benefit feinerman and tsur 2014 yousefi et al 2018 and provides required nutrients by which the fertilizer consumption significantly reduces dawson and hilton 2011 ghneim 2010 sheidaei et al 2016 on the other hand conjunctive surface and groundwater allocation are significant for managing agricultural irrigation groundwater withdrawals and environmental impacts banihabib et al 2019 hashemy et al 2017 2015 safavi and rezaei 2015 safavi and esmikhani 2013 singh et al 2016 consequently a conjunctive reallocation of reclaimed wastewater and groundwater for irrigation is a potential solution yet methods to identify conjunctive reallocation under uncertainty remains less studied optimization techniques have effectively addressed water resources management issues lalehzari et al 2020 especially conjunctive water allocation issues jha et al 2020 liu et al 2020 mehrabi et al 2021 the pso particle swam optimization and mopso multiobjective particle swarm optimization are effectively and broadly used as optimization tools the application of these new techniques known as evolutionary algorithms has dominated in water and agriculture domains reservoir optimization fallah mehdipour et al 2011 hashemy et al 2016 hosseini moghari and banihabib 2014 water quality baltar and fontane 2006 energy management in agriculture barak et al 2016 davijani et al 2016 fard et al 2021 thus researchers have optimized different water related management problems applying these algorithms particularly water allocation yousefi et al 2018 applied pso and mopso models taking three objectives into account maximizing net benefit groundwater recharge and minimizing nitrate leaching by using reclaimed wastewater as a surface water source in varamin iran the results indicated that the net benefit and groundwater recharge were increased while fertilizer was reduced in the proposed cropping pattern however they did not investigate the uncertainties of parameters in objective functions and constraints hatamkhani and moridi 2019 proposed a simulation optimization method using weap and mopso to concurrently achieve the maximization of cultivated area and hydropower energy generation in the kashkan river basin iran the model s performance showed an 8 increase in energy generation with better results in the cultivated area bai et al 2019 optimized a five objective optimization model in the upper yellow river china using the feasible search space fss integrated with mopso they assessed conflicting objectives including control of sediment transport to hydropower facilities sediment transport water demand flood and ice control so far the good performance of these algorithms has demonstrated their capability for optimizing water reallocation nonetheless there are a large number of causes and factors that create uncertainties in optimization problems therefore applying these algorithms considering uncertainties and fuzziness in a complex system is another issue which is not yet resolved neither natural phenomena nor complex operational systems can be precisely formulated owing to existing uncertainties in their components li et al 2015 various fuzzy methods have been applied to address multiple criteria decision making concerning water planning under uncertain circumstances fuzzy inference system models to forecast consumption of urban water demand firat et al 2009 surface and groundwater quality mahapatra et al 2011 vadiati et al 2016 and conjunctive water reallocation milan et al 2018 also researchers used different fuzzy programming for agricultural water demand management banihabib et al 2020 guo et al 2014 li et al 2017 2015 zhang and guo 2017 assadi et al 2018 showed that fully fuzzy linear programming could save agricultural water by 88 22 and an increase in the net benefit was obtained through the optimal cropping pattern in the zarrinehroud basin iran banihabib and shabestari 2017 applied fuzzy and non fuzzy modified technique for order of preference by similarity to ideal solution mtopsis coupled with the analytical hierarchy process ahp as multi criteria decision making mcdm models for agricultural water demand management they observed that the fmtahp model improved the defined coefficient of variation cv index of final rates of experts opinions banihabib et al 2019 proposed a fuzzy multiobjective model using the ga algorithm and credibility level in zarrinroud iran their results demonstrated a good performance of the fuzzy model concerning conjunctive water allocation for optimal cropping pattern under uncertainties compared to the crisp method by 17 and 54 increase in urban and agricultural water allocation respectively rezaei et al 2017 used fuzzy mopso to design the optimal cropping pattern by maximizing farmers net benefit groundwater sustainability and agricultural supply in najafabad iran their results demonstrated the fuzzy model s superiority compared to the multi swarm vector evaluated pso vepso by taking the uncertainties into account wheat and rice were proposed as appropriate cropping pattern for the study area accordingly fuzzy methods were considered a better approach for existing uncertainties and complexities in the system and environment previous studies have not focused on farmers goals water resources managers and environmentalists with all possible uncertainties in the variables thus developing a quantitative model and qualitatively reallocation of reclaimed wastewater in conjunction with groundwater necessitates socioeconomically and environmentally objectives under uncertainties these uncertainties in the varamin irrigation network include lack of accurate surface water lack of detailed qualitative analysis of delivered water to the irrigation network the monthly and seasonally fluctuation of provided reclaimed wastewater by treatment plants and losses in the reclaimed wastewater transmission canal main canals and sub canals for the first time this study develops an optimization model for the conjunctive operation capable of including all these uncertainties the novelty of the present research is developing fuzzy pso fuzzy single objective optimization or fuzzy particle optimization swarm and fuzzy mopso fuzzy multi objective optimization or fuzzy particle swarm optimization models to concurrently address three proposed objectives with the following purposes 1 maximizing the net benefit socio economic aspect and aquifer recharge and minimizing nitrate leaching environmental aspect by presenting an optimal cropping pattern under uncertain conditions 2 models were single objectively and multi objectively assessed and compared to evaluate the pso and mopso performance in both types of optimization models 3 evaluating fuzzy and non fuzzy optimization models with various cropping patterns to examine their impacts on the objective functions results can provide strategies for planning and managing reclaimed wastewater groundwater and nitrogen fertilizer use in irrigation networks under uncertainties of climatic and hydrologic conditions and crop and water prices 2 material and methods 2 1 case study the varamin plain is located 30 km southeast of tehran iran between 29 58 n 56 08 e the average annual precipitation is 144 mm 42 in winter fig 1 is the study area map that shows the reclaimed wastewater transmission canal the main canal and sub canals of the varamin irrigation network the reclaimed wastewater transmission canal started from the tehran southern reclaimed wastewater treatment plant and terminated in point a divided into oa bc and ab canals these main canals are branching into nine sub canals or op oh au amx by bv cw and cnz the au sub canal with a 3053 ha of irrigation area was studied in the present study wheat barley maize alfalfa and tomato 1 1 tomato is considered as an indicator for vegetables due to its great proportion in comparison to other cultivated vegetables in the area are the main crops irrigated by this sub canal 2 2 surface water and groundwater source the varamin plain is of significant importance due to its leading part in economic and social capacities mainly agricultural and industrial activities the increasing development of this plain led to water resources development projects engineers 2014 2015 surface water resources in the varamin plain are jajrood and reclaimed wastewater canal from tehran southern reclaimed wastewater treatment plant groundwater has been withdrawn through wells springs and qanats table 1 shows the water supply in the study area the water demand for the au sub canal is 36 41 mcm however only 25 3 mcm have been supplied 2 3 pso and mopso algorithms the pso model for stochastic optimization problems was first introduced by kennedy and eberhart eberhart and kennedy 1995 this method is inspired by the movement of fish and bird flocks which is labeled as a population based algorithm being known as an evolutionary algorithm it searches the optimally possible solutions in a search space through the position and velocity of each particle which is updated in each step according to the positions of particles that are named as a personal best each particle s best known position and global best swarm s best known position pso algorithm can be expressed as follows supposing d dimensional space and i th particle of the population having a position vector xt and a velocity vector v t with its pbest and gbest as personal and swarm knowledge respectively therefore its equation follows as 1 x i t 1 x i t v i t 1 2 v i t 1 wv i t c 1 rand 0 1 p best i x i t c 2 rand 1 0 g best i x i t where v i t 1 is the new velocity of particle i in iteration t 1 v i t is the velocity of particle i in iteration t x i t 1 is new position of particle i in iteration t 1 x i t is position of particle i in iteration t w is the inertia weight and rand 0 1 is a random number between zero and one to apply randomness in particle s movements c 1 and c 2 are individual and social parameters that assist the algorithm in converging speedily each particle can update its position towards an optimal solution using eqs 1 and 2 the pso algorithm demonstrated good performance in single objective problems shi and eberhart 1998 later coello and lechuga 2002 proposed the mopso algorithm for the conflicting multiobjective problems in which possible solutions can be found in its pareto front this algorithm is developed based on pso in mopso velocity and position vectors equations remain the same as eqs 1 and 2 except for the objective function 2 3 1 fuzzy method in the present study uncertainties in parameters consist of water availability mainly reclaimed wastewater due to its dependency to urban water consumption that fluctuates seasonally and monthly precipitation as a climatic input data is uncertain thus the aquifer recharge coefficient for precipitation and irrigation losses was considered fuzzy net irrigation requirement was fuzzified owing to its dependency on climatic conditions quantitative data of nitrate amounts in the reclaimed water groundwater and soil were other fuzzy parameters these quantitative data were gathered by measuring random samples water fertilizer and crops prices are other fuzzy parameters that affect the net benefit of crops all these fuzzy parameters are specified in constraints and objective function the lack of accurate data and correct prediction has led to inefficient long term water planning in irrigation networks which is addressed by the fuzzy multi objective optimization model developed in this study the parameters were considered at the monthly time steps the main reason for selecting the monthly time scale was related to the practical orientation of the present study since the agricultural water demands needs are estimated monthly by the irrigation district s manager in this study area it is worth noting that fuzzy configuration can be efficiently conducted at more minor time scales including daily and hourly steps jayalakshmi and pandian 2012 proposed an appropriate approach for fully optimization problems in which all coefficients of objective and constraints are asymmetric fuzzy triangular numbers if parameters a ij c j x j b i and z can be expressed as p j q j r j x j y j t j a ij b ij c ij b i g i h i and z 1 z 2 z 3 thus the equation can be obtained as follows 3 max z 1 z 2 z 3 j 1 n p j q j r j x j y j t j st j 1 n a ij b ij c ij x j y j t j b i g i h i i 1 2 m j 1 2 n x j 0 y j x j 0 t j y j 0 i 1 2 m j 1 2 n suppose that a ij b ij c ij x j y j t j s ij u ij o ij then the equation can be written as 4 max z 1 z 2 z 3 j 1 n p j q j r j x j y j t j st j 1 n s ij u ij o ij b i g i h i i 1 2 m j 1 2 n x j 0 y j x j 0 t j y j 0 i 1 2 m j 1 2 n by using the mathematical operators the equation can be written as a crisp problem as table 2 this method has no limitation such as ranking for the objective function and by decomposing the main function into three levels upper middle and lower table 2 the decision variables and the objective value at each level can be obtained by using the pso and mopso algorithms these algorithms were written and developed in the matlab programming language for this study the flowchart shows the steps of this study and the performance of the jayalakshmi and et al approach fig 2 qualitative and quantitative reclaimed wastewater and groundwater data were collected for the present study and nitrate and nitrogen samples of soil and reclaimed wastewater were analyzed net irrigation requirements for crops were obtained using cropwat software for ten years between 2009 and 2019 then the aquacrop software was used to estimate the crop yield eq 5 calculates the critical plant nitrogen concentration soltani et al 2013 which was applied to assess the potential nitrate in reclaimed wastewater and groundwater for monthly required fertilizer demand 5 i 1 12 j 1 8 t d i j

second objective function then three levels lower middle and upper triangular fuzzy number were calculated for parameters in 10 years for the fuzzification phase all parameters in objective functions and constraints were considered fuzzy except the cultivation area thus the parameters minimum values in these ten years were lower for fuzzy triangular numbers similarly for upper and middle levels maximum and average values were employed in the equations after that three levels for objective functions and new constraints for their upper and lower levels were defined next the pso and mopso models were developed the non fuzzy pso and mopso and fuzzy pso and mopso for a single objective and multi objectives were subsequently obtained fig 2 shows steps in this study following the jaylakshimi method also three crops cotton grape and pistachio were added to the proposed cropping pattern to improve all three objectives not only due to their profitability but also low net irrigation requirement and nitrate demand the pso models were performed with 1000 particles and 100 iterations and the mopso models were performed with 1000 particles and 500 iterations in matlab programming language 2 3 2 objective functions three objective functions and their constraints were written as follows 6 max z 1 j 1 8 nr j a j ccw i 1 12 j 1 8 vcw ij cgw i 1 12 j 1 8 vgw ij t i 1 12

reclaimed wastewater and groundwater eqs 11 and 12 present the constraints on consumed reclaimed wastewater and groundwater limited by their availability in the month i the cultivation area for crop j is constrained in eqs 13 and 14 3 result and discussion the fuzzy non fuzzy and current status results were compared to assess the performance of pso and mopso algorithms in the optimization models there were 44 decisions variables including cultivated areas for eight crops wheat barley maize alfalfa tomato cotton grape and pistachio monthly groundwater reclaimed wastewater and fertilizer demand moreover to draw a better comparison an index was defined based on the ratio of each decision variable s value and the objective function to the value of their current status fig 3 compares the net benefit and the total cultivated area in all non fuzzy and fuzzy pso and mopso models and the current status the total cultivated area decreased in all models however the net benefit increased in four non fuzzy and fuzzy pso and mopso models these models were fuzzy and non fuzzy pso z1 and fuzzy and non fuzzy mopso the fuzzy and non fuzzy pso models for z1 optimize the net benefit as a single objective function therefore it maximizes the net benefit of the cropping pattern these models have used only over 90 of the cultivated area with obtaining a 60 and 40 increase in the net benefit compared to the current status respectively furthermore 16 and 0 07 growth were achieved regarding the net benefit of applying fuzzy and non fuzzy mopso models whereas they optimized 91 and 72 of the cultivated area although the cultivated area did not increase the net benefit grew in these models these results demonstrate that adding cotton grape and pistachio to cropping patterns could increase the study area s profitability on the other hand fuzzy and non fuzzy pso models for minimizing nitrate leaching z2 optimized only 0 14 and 0 20 of the total cultivated area with a noticeable reduction in the net benefit the net benefit was only 0 17 in the fuzzy pso model for z2 and 0 24 in its non fuzzy model similarly fuzzy and non fuzzy pso models of minimizing groundwater withdrawal z3 displayed a small percentage of the net benefit and cultivated area compared to the current status the cultivated area indices were obtained 0 5 and 0 63 in non fuzzy and fuzzy pso models for z3 moreover 0 65 and 0 86 net benefit were obtained in non fuzzy and fuzzy pso models for z3 respectively above all the net benefit improved in the models that aim to maximize crops profit the fuzzy mopso model can be selected as the best model since it takes all research objectives into account under existing uncertainties having compared the net benefit and cultivated area ratios in fuzzy and non fuzzy optimization models fuzzy models better perform these optimization problems these models have enjoyed more significant net benefit in comparison to non fuzzy models the total consumed groundwater and reclaimed wastewater and the percentage of their contribution to the total consumed water is shown in fig 4 as can be seen the current proportion of the total groundwater and reclaimed wastewater is more than 75 and less than 25 respectively the agricultural sector is using 23 78 mcm groundwater and 7 09 mcm reclaimed wastewater after applying optimization models the contribution of reclaimed wastewater in all models had a significant increase compared to the current status except fuzzy and non fuzzy models of the objective function z2 these models minimize nitrate leaching and there is a fair amount of nitrate in reclaimed wastewater thus over 70 of the allocated water was supplied by groundwater reclaimed wastewater was consumed up to 0 78 and 0 72 mcm in fuzzy and non fuzzy models for z2 whereas 2 5 and 3 2 mcm were optimized for groundwater in these models 40 contribution of reclaimed wastewater was noticeable in fuzzy pso for maximizing the net benefit function z1 this model optimized 10 6 mcm for groundwater and 7 0 mcm for reclaimed wastewater the reasons behind this increase are the low price of reclaimed wastewater and the objective of the first function maximizing crops profit the non fuzzy pso for z1 had almost the same outcome however the reclaimed wastewater use was relatively lower than fuzzy pso for z1 fuzzy mopso models optimized groundwater and reclaimed wastewater up to 11 4 and 6 7 mcm respectively reclaimed wastewater had almost 37 contribution to the total consumed water in this model the non fuzzy mopso indicated similar results with a 36 contribution of reclaimed wastewater therefore the fuzzy mopso model had a slightly better contribution of reclaimed wastewater moreover the proportion of fuzzy models of maximizing net benefit z1 and minimizing groundwater withdrawal z3 were obtained 60 and 37 respectively whereas their proportion in non fuzzy was less thus all fuzzy models slightly improved the use of reclaimed wastewater in comparison to their non fuzzy models therefore water managers goals were satisfied by reducing groundwater and increasing the reclaimed wastewater consumption for agricultural demand the fuzzy mopso model fulfilled all three requirements in the uncertain condition that is more efficient than fuzzy single objective pso for z1 z2 and z3 addressing the optimization single objectively water consumption efficiency can be defined as the net benefit ratio irr to the total consumed agricultural water cubic meter and fig 5 illustrates this index in all models the value of water consumption efficiency grew in all models compared to the current status the value of this index was 40 000 irr cubic meter in fuzzy and non fuzzy pso for z1 as these models presented a cropping pattern with maximum profitability and minimum water consumption like barley wheat and pistachio fig 6 furthermore the lower price of reclaimed wastewater than groundwater is another factor for this index the contribution of reclaimed wastewater increased relative to groundwater in all models fig 4 the water consumption efficiency index decreased to 27970 and 25097 irr cubic meter in fuzzy and non fuzzy mopso models due to taking all three objectives into account therefore low fertilizer demand should be considered in addition to low water demand in the proposed cropping pattern the fuzzy mopso model with the value of water consumption efficiency index of 27 970 irr cubic meter was obtained better than fuzzy and non fuzzy pso models for z2 and z3 having the values of 23243 26496 26634 and 18789 irr cubic meter respectively only the non fuzzy pso model for z2 demonstrated more outstanding performance than its fuzzy model these models minimize nitrate leaching that led to less reclaimed wastewater consumption hence its non fuzzy model allocated a higher amount of reclaimed wastewater resulting in less use of groundwater this caused a higher net benefit due to the lower price of reclaimed wastewater consequently more groundwater was consumed and the total water price increased in this model resulting in a lower value for the water consumption efficiency index to sum up the fuzzy model performed better and since fuzzy mopso multi objectively addressed optimization objectives this model can be recommended for the optimal cropping pattern fig 6 illustrates the proposed cropping pattern in all models before optimization the share of cultivated area for each crop was 26 26 17 9 and 22 for wheat barley maize alfalfa tomato respectively three crops including grape cotton and pistachio have zero shares of cultivated area having added three crops and applying the optimization model the cultivated area variation was obtained as follows the cultivation area of wheat barley and maize increased allocating 26 30 and 19 respectively in fuzzy pso model for z1 due to their high profit tomato and alfalfa on the other hand had a smaller percentage in this model pistachio had a share of 8 7 in the cultivated area which shows its profitability whereas grape and cotton had almost 2 in total the non fuzzy pso model for z1 showed almost the same percentage of cultivated area for each crop as its fuzzy optimization model generally the cultivation area decreased in single objective models of z2 and z3 due to their objective functions minimizing nitrate leaching and groundwater withdrawal the percentage of cultivated area for wheat barley maize alfalfa tomato and pistachio was 24 25 16 8 and 19 respectively in the fuzzy pso model z2 pistachio allocated 7 of the cultivation area in this model the allocation of cultivation for grape and cotton was insignificant the percentage of cultivated area for wheat barley maize alfalfa tomato and pistachio was 23 27 17 8 and 13 respectively in the fuzzy pso model z3 pistachio allocated 7 of the cultivation area in this model the allocation of cultivated area for cotton was almost 3 due to its low net irrigation compared to grape and the share of grape in cultivation area was insignificant maize had a 2 reduction in its cultivation area in the non fuzzy pso model for z3 compared to its fuzzy model also a 6 increase was obtained for tomatoes in the non fuzzy pso model for z3 compared to its fuzzy optimization fuzzy mopso model presented the proposed cropping pattern with outstanding contributions of wheat barley maize alfalfa tomato and pistachio with a share of 26 21 16 10 20 and 5 respectively whereas the contribution share of these crops were 27 17 17 9 22 and 6 respectively in non fuzzy mopso model as can be seen three added crops grape cotton and pistachio allocated approximately 5 10 of cultivated area demonstrating their profitability in particular pistachio with the highest contribution to the cropping pattern comparing to cotton and grape however fuzzy and non fuzzy pso models for minimizing groundwater withdrawal z3 optimized almost 3 of the cultivated area for cotton due to its low net irrigation compared to pistachio and grape fig 6 on the other hand the tomato has a smaller percentage in fuzzy and non fuzzy pso to maximize the net benefit z1 due to its low profitability in contrast this crop made more than 13 share in other models alfalfa had almost the same percentage in all models overall the fuzzy mopso model indicated a cropping pattern considering uncertainties hence this cropping pattern can be applied for the study area 4 discussion comparison of proposed cropping pattern with five in the previous study and eight crops in this research yousefi et al 2018 conducted a study using multiobjective optimization mopso to propose a cropping pattern for the au sub canal in 2014 2015 with five crops wheat barley maize alfalfa and tomato table 3 compares the results of the present study and previous research the results show that the use of reclaimed wastewater increased to 6 7 mcm whereas only 5 8 mcm of reclaimed wastewater was optimized to be used in the previous research the net benefit per area index irr ha was defined to make an accurate comparison this index is the ratio of the net benefit irr to the total area ha having compared the net benefit per unit area index in both studies the high profitability of three added crops to the cropping pattern is economically significant for farmers thus the value of this was 5e 07 irr ha in the previous study and it increased to 1 82e 08 irr ha this result indicated a 33 6 growth in the net benefit per unit area more importantly considering the existing uncertainties provided a better understanding of the real situation and addressed the problem better table 4 5 conclusion in this research conjunctive reallocation of reclaimed wastewater and groundwater was optimized by applying the fuzzy and non fuzzy pso and mopso algorithms to propose a cropping pattern in the varamin plain under uncertain circumstances considering water shortage in the area the results can be summarized as follows the contribution of reclaimed wastewater for irrigation increased in conjunctive optimization of reclaimed wastewater and groundwater moreover the total water consumption was reduced by proposing an appropriate cropping pattern applying f pso and fuzzy mopso algorithms considering uncertainties fuzzy models produced better optimal results particularly for the net benefit and water consumption efficiency as these models consider uncertain circumstances as the real world furthermore the fuzzy mopso model solved three opposing objective functions the net benefit maximization nitrate leaching and groundwater withdrawal minimization by satisfying all socio economic and environmental aspects for sustainable water management proposing optimal cropping patterns with their proper contribution by single and multi objectively applying algorithms addressed water optimization in the circumstances with uncertainties of parameters and variables overall all fuzzy models significantly improved the current condition comparing to non fuzzy models that prove the importance of considering fuzzy logic in optimization models for sustainable water management the present study significantly improved the net benefit per unit area by proposing the cropping pattern with crops having high profitability compared to previous research the present research has targeted accomplishing objectives with different aspects to solve one of the water management problems especially in the agricultural sector under existing uncertainties whether in system or nature optimizing net benefit nitrate leaching and groundwater withdrawal were considered in presenting the proposed cropping pattern with cost effective use of water reallocation and more minor environmental damage moreover for further development of this study fuzzy stochastic optimization can be considered to trace the path of probabilities in an uncertain condition finally this research can be applied in other regions and can bring improvement in water allocation and cropping patterns in an uncertain situation declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper 
9952,water scarcity is a significant global challenge water resources planning and management are vital to all sectors primarily for the agricultural sector identified as a significant consumer conjunctive water use management is ideal for decreasing water scarcity especially in arid and semiarid regions more importantly considering uncertainties in water management is critical to planning and management issues this study develops a fuzzy optimization model aiming at a qualitative quantitative conjunctive reallocation of reclaimed wastewater and groundwater resources three objectives including maximizing economic benefit minimizing fertilizer consumption and groundwater withdrawal were assessed in iran s varamin irrigation network this research uses fuzzy and non fuzzy

optimization models are compared the particle swarm optimization pso and multi objective pso mopso algorithms optimized single and multi objective problems a fuzzy optimization model is superior to the non fuzzy optimization model regarding optimizing multi objective functions the results indicated that the net benefit increased up to 16 without increasing the cultivated area in the fuzzy mopso model moreover groundwater withdrawal was reduced by using a larger share of reclaimed wastewater in total water consumption this increased the use of potential nitrate in reclaimed wastewater and reduced fertilizer consumption this study highlights achieving socio economic and environmental goals under uncertain circumstances using agricultural water strategies through reclaimed wastewater also a general improvement in water consumption efficiency was achieved through the optimal cropping pattern keywords conjunctive reallocation environmental sustainability fuzzy optimization mopso algorithm multi objective function 1 introduction water scarcity is a globally daunting challenge that has gradually increased competition between different water consumption sectors as the largest water consumer agriculture is facing this challenge and is under pressure due to increasing food demand thus needs a long term solution hashemy et al 2018 li et al 2017 reclaimed wastewater has been proposed as an effective solution for water scarcity particularly for irrigation tayebikhorami et al 2020 the use of this potential source increases farmers benefit feinerman and tsur 2014 yousefi et al 2018 and provides required nutrients by which the fertilizer consumption significantly reduces dawson and hilton 2011 ghneim 2010 sheidaei et al 2016 on the other hand conjunctive surface and groundwater allocation are significant for managing agricultural irrigation groundwater withdrawals and environmental impacts banihabib et al 2019 hashemy et al 2017 2015 safavi and rezaei 2015 safavi and esmikhani 2013 singh et al 2016 consequently a conjunctive reallocation of reclaimed wastewater and groundwater for irrigation is a potential solution yet methods to identify conjunctive reallocation under uncertainty remains less studied optimization techniques have effectively addressed water resources management issues lalehzari et al 2020 especially conjunctive water allocation issues jha et al 2020 liu et al 2020 mehrabi et al 2021 the pso particle swam optimization and mopso multiobjective particle swarm optimization are effectively and broadly used as optimization tools the application of these new techniques known as evolutionary algorithms has dominated in water and agriculture domains reservoir optimization fallah mehdipour et al 2011 hashemy et al 2016 hosseini moghari and banihabib 2014 water quality baltar and fontane 2006 energy management in agriculture barak et al 2016 davijani et al 2016 fard et al 2021 thus researchers have optimized different water related management problems applying these algorithms particularly water allocation yousefi et al 2018 applied pso and mopso models taking three objectives into account maximizing net benefit groundwater recharge and minimizing nitrate leaching by using reclaimed wastewater as a surface water source in varamin iran the results indicated that the net benefit and groundwater recharge were increased while fertilizer was reduced in the proposed cropping pattern however they did not investigate the uncertainties of parameters in objective functions and constraints hatamkhani and moridi 2019 proposed a simulation optimization method using weap and mopso to concurrently achieve the maximization of cultivated area and hydropower energy generation in the kashkan river basin iran the model s performance showed an 8 increase in energy generation with better results in the cultivated area bai et al 2019 optimized a five objective optimization model in the upper yellow river china using the feasible search space fss integrated with mopso they assessed conflicting objectives including control of sediment transport to hydropower facilities sediment transport water demand flood and ice control so far the good performance of these algorithms has demonstrated their capability for optimizing water reallocation nonetheless there are a large number of causes and factors that create uncertainties in optimization problems therefore applying these algorithms considering uncertainties and fuzziness in a complex system is another issue which is not yet resolved neither natural phenomena nor complex operational systems can be precisely formulated owing to existing uncertainties in their components li et al 2015 various fuzzy methods have been applied to address multiple criteria decision making concerning water planning under uncertain circumstances fuzzy inference system models to forecast consumption of urban water demand firat et al 2009 surface and groundwater quality mahapatra et al 2011 vadiati et al 2016 and conjunctive water reallocation milan et al 2018 also researchers used different fuzzy programming for agricultural water demand management banihabib et al 2020 guo et al 2014 li et al 2017 2015 zhang and guo 2017 assadi et al 2018 showed that fully fuzzy linear programming could save agricultural water by 88 22 and an increase in the net benefit was obtained through the optimal cropping pattern in the zarrinehroud basin iran banihabib and shabestari 2017 applied fuzzy and non fuzzy modified technique for order of preference by similarity to ideal solution mtopsis coupled with the analytical hierarchy process ahp as multi criteria decision making mcdm models for agricultural water demand management they observed that the fmtahp model improved the defined coefficient of variation cv index of final rates of experts opinions banihabib et al 2019 proposed a fuzzy multiobjective model using the ga algorithm and credibility level in zarrinroud iran their results demonstrated a good performance of the fuzzy model concerning conjunctive water allocation for optimal cropping pattern under uncertainties compared to the crisp method by 17 and 54 increase in urban and agricultural water allocation respectively rezaei et al 2017 used fuzzy mopso to design the optimal cropping pattern by maximizing farmers net benefit groundwater sustainability and agricultural supply in najafabad iran their results demonstrated the fuzzy model s superiority compared to the multi swarm vector evaluated pso vepso by taking the uncertainties into account wheat and rice were proposed as appropriate cropping pattern for the study area accordingly fuzzy methods were considered a better approach for existing uncertainties and complexities in the system and environment previous studies have not focused on farmers goals water resources managers and environmentalists with all possible uncertainties in the variables thus developing a quantitative model and qualitatively reallocation of reclaimed wastewater in conjunction with groundwater necessitates socioeconomically and environmentally objectives under uncertainties these uncertainties in the varamin irrigation network include lack of accurate surface water lack of detailed qualitative analysis of delivered water to the irrigation network the monthly and seasonally fluctuation of provided reclaimed wastewater by treatment plants and losses in the reclaimed wastewater transmission canal main canals and sub canals for the first time this study develops an optimization model for the conjunctive operation capable of including all these uncertainties the novelty of the present research is developing fuzzy pso fuzzy single objective optimization or fuzzy particle optimization swarm and fuzzy mopso fuzzy multi objective optimization or fuzzy particle swarm optimization models to concurrently address three proposed objectives with the following purposes 1 maximizing the net benefit socio economic aspect and aquifer recharge and minimizing nitrate leaching environmental aspect by presenting an optimal cropping pattern under uncertain conditions 2 models were single objectively and multi objectively assessed and compared to evaluate the pso and mopso performance in both types of optimization models 3 evaluating fuzzy and non fuzzy optimization models with various cropping patterns to examine their impacts on the objective functions results can provide strategies for planning and managing reclaimed wastewater groundwater and nitrogen fertilizer use in irrigation networks under uncertainties of climatic and hydrologic conditions and crop and water prices 2 material and methods 2 1 case study the varamin plain is located 30 km southeast of tehran iran between 29 58 n 56 08 e the average annual precipitation is 144 mm 42 in winter fig 1 is the study area map that shows the reclaimed wastewater transmission canal the main canal and sub canals of the varamin irrigation network the reclaimed wastewater transmission canal started from the tehran southern reclaimed wastewater treatment plant and terminated in point a divided into oa bc and ab canals these main canals are branching into nine sub canals or op oh au amx by bv cw and cnz the au sub canal with a 3053 ha of irrigation area was studied in the present study wheat barley maize alfalfa and tomato 1 1 tomato is considered as an indicator for vegetables due to its great proportion in comparison to other cultivated vegetables in the area are the main crops irrigated by this sub canal 2 2 surface water and groundwater source the varamin plain is of significant importance due to its leading part in economic and social capacities mainly agricultural and industrial activities the increasing development of this plain led to water resources development projects engineers 2014 2015 surface water resources in the varamin plain are jajrood and reclaimed wastewater canal from tehran southern reclaimed wastewater treatment plant groundwater has been withdrawn through wells springs and qanats table 1 shows the water supply in the study area the water demand for the au sub canal is 36 41 mcm however only 25 3 mcm have been supplied 2 3 pso and mopso algorithms the pso model for stochastic optimization problems was first introduced by kennedy and eberhart eberhart and kennedy 1995 this method is inspired by the movement of fish and bird flocks which is labeled as a population based algorithm being known as an evolutionary algorithm it searches the optimally possible solutions in a search space through the position and velocity of each particle which is updated in each step according to the positions of particles that are named as a personal best each particle s best known position and global best swarm s best known position pso algorithm can be expressed as follows supposing d dimensional space and i th particle of the population having a position vector xt and a velocity vector v t with its pbest and gbest as personal and swarm knowledge respectively therefore its equation follows as 1 x i t 1 x i t v i t 1 2 v i t 1 wv i t c 1 rand 0 1 p best i x i t c 2 rand 1 0 g best i x i t where v i t 1 is the new velocity of particle i in iteration t 1 v i t is the velocity of particle i in iteration t x i t 1 is new position of particle i in iteration t 1 x i t is position of particle i in iteration t w is the inertia weight and rand 0 1 is a random number between zero and one to apply randomness in particle s movements c 1 and c 2 are individual and social parameters that assist the algorithm in converging speedily each particle can update its position towards an optimal solution using eqs 1 and 2 the pso algorithm demonstrated good performance in single objective problems shi and eberhart 1998 later coello and lechuga 2002 proposed the mopso algorithm for the conflicting multiobjective problems in which possible solutions can be found in its pareto front this algorithm is developed based on pso in mopso velocity and position vectors equations remain the same as eqs 1 and 2 except for the objective function 2 3 1 fuzzy method in the present study uncertainties in parameters consist of water availability mainly reclaimed wastewater due to its dependency to urban water consumption that fluctuates seasonally and monthly precipitation as a climatic input data is uncertain thus the aquifer recharge coefficient for precipitation and irrigation losses was considered fuzzy net irrigation requirement was fuzzified owing to its dependency on climatic conditions quantitative data of nitrate amounts in the reclaimed water groundwater and soil were other fuzzy parameters these quantitative data were gathered by measuring random samples water fertilizer and crops prices are other fuzzy parameters that affect the net benefit of crops all these fuzzy parameters are specified in constraints and objective function the lack of accurate data and correct prediction has led to inefficient long term water planning in irrigation networks which is addressed by the fuzzy multi objective optimization model developed in this study the parameters were considered at the monthly time steps the main reason for selecting the monthly time scale was related to the practical orientation of the present study since the agricultural water demands needs are estimated monthly by the irrigation district s manager in this study area it is worth noting that fuzzy configuration can be efficiently conducted at more minor time scales including daily and hourly steps jayalakshmi and pandian 2012 proposed an appropriate approach for fully optimization problems in which all coefficients of objective and constraints are asymmetric fuzzy triangular numbers if parameters a ij c j x j b i and z can be expressed as p j q j r j x j y j t j a ij b ij c ij b i g i h i and z 1 z 2 z 3 thus the equation can be obtained as follows 3 max z 1 z 2 z 3 j 1 n p j q j r j x j y j t j st j 1 n a ij b ij c ij x j y j t j b i g i h i i 1 2 m j 1 2 n x j 0 y j x j 0 t j y j 0 i 1 2 m j 1 2 n suppose that a ij b ij c ij x j y j t j s ij u ij o ij then the equation can be written as 4 max z 1 z 2 z 3 j 1 n p j q j r j x j y j t j st j 1 n s ij u ij o ij b i g i h i i 1 2 m j 1 2 n x j 0 y j x j 0 t j y j 0 i 1 2 m j 1 2 n by using the mathematical operators the equation can be written as a crisp problem as table 2 this method has no limitation such as ranking for the objective function and by decomposing the main function into three levels upper middle and lower table 2 the decision variables and the objective value at each level can be obtained by using the pso and mopso algorithms these algorithms were written and developed in the matlab programming language for this study the flowchart shows the steps of this study and the performance of the jayalakshmi and et al approach fig 2 qualitative and quantitative reclaimed wastewater and groundwater data were collected for the present study and nitrate and nitrogen samples of soil and reclaimed wastewater were analyzed net irrigation requirements for crops were obtained using cropwat software for ten years between 2009 and 2019 then the aquacrop software was used to estimate the crop yield eq 5 calculates the critical plant nitrogen concentration soltani et al 2013 which was applied to assess the potential nitrate in reclaimed wastewater and groundwater for monthly required fertilizer demand 5 i 1 12 j 1 8 t d i j

second objective function then three levels lower middle and upper triangular fuzzy number were calculated for parameters in 10 years for the fuzzification phase all parameters in objective functions and constraints were considered fuzzy except the cultivation area thus the parameters minimum values in these ten years were lower for fuzzy triangular numbers similarly for upper and middle levels maximum and average values were employed in the equations after that three levels for objective functions and new constraints for their upper and lower levels were defined next the pso and mopso models were developed the non fuzzy pso and mopso and fuzzy pso and mopso for a single objective and multi objectives were subsequently obtained fig 2 shows steps in this study following the jaylakshimi method also three crops cotton grape and pistachio were added to the proposed cropping pattern to improve all three objectives not only due to their profitability but also low net irrigation requirement and nitrate demand the pso models were performed with 1000 particles and 100 iterations and the mopso models were performed with 1000 particles and 500 iterations in matlab programming language 2 3 2 objective functions three objective functions and their constraints were written as follows 6 max z 1 j 1 8 nr j a j ccw i 1 12 j 1 8 vcw ij cgw i 1 12 j 1 8 vgw ij t i 1 12

reclaimed wastewater and groundwater eqs 11 and 12 present the constraints on consumed reclaimed wastewater and groundwater limited by their availability in the month i the cultivation area for crop j is constrained in eqs 13 and 14 3 result and discussion the fuzzy non fuzzy and current status results were compared to assess the performance of pso and mopso algorithms in the optimization models there were 44 decisions variables including cultivated areas for eight crops wheat barley maize alfalfa tomato cotton grape and pistachio monthly groundwater reclaimed wastewater and fertilizer demand moreover to draw a better comparison an index was defined based on the ratio of each decision variable s value and the objective function to the value of their current status fig 3 compares the net benefit and the total cultivated area in all non fuzzy and fuzzy pso and mopso models and the current status the total cultivated area decreased in all models however the net benefit increased in four non fuzzy and fuzzy pso and mopso models these models were fuzzy and non fuzzy pso z1 and fuzzy and non fuzzy mopso the fuzzy and non fuzzy pso models for z1 optimize the net benefit as a single objective function therefore it maximizes the net benefit of the cropping pattern these models have used only over 90 of the cultivated area with obtaining a 60 and 40 increase in the net benefit compared to the current status respectively furthermore 16 and 0 07 growth were achieved regarding the net benefit of applying fuzzy and non fuzzy mopso models whereas they optimized 91 and 72 of the cultivated area although the cultivated area did not increase the net benefit grew in these models these results demonstrate that adding cotton grape and pistachio to cropping patterns could increase the study area s profitability on the other hand fuzzy and non fuzzy pso models for minimizing nitrate leaching z2 optimized only 0 14 and 0 20 of the total cultivated area with a noticeable reduction in the net benefit the net benefit was only 0 17 in the fuzzy pso model for z2 and 0 24 in its non fuzzy model similarly fuzzy and non fuzzy pso models of minimizing groundwater withdrawal z3 displayed a small percentage of the net benefit and cultivated area compared to the current status the cultivated area indices were obtained 0 5 and 0 63 in non fuzzy and fuzzy pso models for z3 moreover 0 65 and 0 86 net benefit were obtained in non fuzzy and fuzzy pso models for z3 respectively above all the net benefit improved in the models that aim to maximize crops profit the fuzzy mopso model can be selected as the best model since it takes all research objectives into account under existing uncertainties having compared the net benefit and cultivated area ratios in fuzzy and non fuzzy optimization models fuzzy models better perform these optimization problems these models have enjoyed more significant net benefit in comparison to non fuzzy models the total consumed groundwater and reclaimed wastewater and the percentage of their contribution to the total consumed water is shown in fig 4 as can be seen the current proportion of the total groundwater and reclaimed wastewater is more than 75 and less than 25 respectively the agricultural sector is using 23 78 mcm groundwater and 7 09 mcm reclaimed wastewater after applying optimization models the contribution of reclaimed wastewater in all models had a significant increase compared to the current status except fuzzy and non fuzzy models of the objective function z2 these models minimize nitrate leaching and there is a fair amount of nitrate in reclaimed wastewater thus over 70 of the allocated water was supplied by groundwater reclaimed wastewater was consumed up to 0 78 and 0 72 mcm in fuzzy and non fuzzy models for z2 whereas 2 5 and 3 2 mcm were optimized for groundwater in these models 40 contribution of reclaimed wastewater was noticeable in fuzzy pso for maximizing the net benefit function z1 this model optimized 10 6 mcm for groundwater and 7 0 mcm for reclaimed wastewater the reasons behind this increase are the low price of reclaimed wastewater and the objective of the first function maximizing crops profit the non fuzzy pso for z1 had almost the same outcome however the reclaimed wastewater use was relatively lower than fuzzy pso for z1 fuzzy mopso models optimized groundwater and reclaimed wastewater up to 11 4 and 6 7 mcm respectively reclaimed wastewater had almost 37 contribution to the total consumed water in this model the non fuzzy mopso indicated similar results with a 36 contribution of reclaimed wastewater therefore the fuzzy mopso model had a slightly better contribution of reclaimed wastewater moreover the proportion of fuzzy models of maximizing net benefit z1 and minimizing groundwater withdrawal z3 were obtained 60 and 37 respectively whereas their proportion in non fuzzy was less thus all fuzzy models slightly improved the use of reclaimed wastewater in comparison to their non fuzzy models therefore water managers goals were satisfied by reducing groundwater and increasing the reclaimed wastewater consumption for agricultural demand the fuzzy mopso model fulfilled all three requirements in the uncertain condition that is more efficient than fuzzy single objective pso for z1 z2 and z3 addressing the optimization single objectively water consumption efficiency can be defined as the net benefit ratio irr to the total consumed agricultural water cubic meter and fig 5 illustrates this index in all models the value of water consumption efficiency grew in all models compared to the current status the value of this index was 40 000 irr cubic meter in fuzzy and non fuzzy pso for z1 as these models presented a cropping pattern with maximum profitability and minimum water consumption like barley wheat and pistachio fig 6 furthermore the lower price of reclaimed wastewater than groundwater is another factor for this index the contribution of reclaimed wastewater increased relative to groundwater in all models fig 4 the water consumption efficiency index decreased to 27970 and 25097 irr cubic meter in fuzzy and non fuzzy mopso models due to taking all three objectives into account therefore low fertilizer demand should be considered in addition to low water demand in the proposed cropping pattern the fuzzy mopso model with the value of water consumption efficiency index of 27 970 irr cubic meter was obtained better than fuzzy and non fuzzy pso models for z2 and z3 having the values of 23243 26496 26634 and 18789 irr cubic meter respectively only the non fuzzy pso model for z2 demonstrated more outstanding performance than its fuzzy model these models minimize nitrate leaching that led to less reclaimed wastewater consumption hence its non fuzzy model allocated a higher amount of reclaimed wastewater resulting in less use of groundwater this caused a higher net benefit due to the lower price of reclaimed wastewater consequently more groundwater was consumed and the total water price increased in this model resulting in a lower value for the water consumption efficiency index to sum up the fuzzy model performed better and since fuzzy mopso multi objectively addressed optimization objectives this model can be recommended for the optimal cropping pattern fig 6 illustrates the proposed cropping pattern in all models before optimization the share of cultivated area for each crop was 26 26 17 9 and 22 for wheat barley maize alfalfa tomato respectively three crops including grape cotton and pistachio have zero shares of cultivated area having added three crops and applying the optimization model the cultivated area variation was obtained as follows the cultivation area of wheat barley and maize increased allocating 26 30 and 19 respectively in fuzzy pso model for z1 due to their high profit tomato and alfalfa on the other hand had a smaller percentage in this model pistachio had a share of 8 7 in the cultivated area which shows its profitability whereas grape and cotton had almost 2 in total the non fuzzy pso model for z1 showed almost the same percentage of cultivated area for each crop as its fuzzy optimization model generally the cultivation area decreased in single objective models of z2 and z3 due to their objective functions minimizing nitrate leaching and groundwater withdrawal the percentage of cultivated area for wheat barley maize alfalfa tomato and pistachio was 24 25 16 8 and 19 respectively in the fuzzy pso model z2 pistachio allocated 7 of the cultivation area in this model the allocation of cultivation for grape and cotton was insignificant the percentage of cultivated area for wheat barley maize alfalfa tomato and pistachio was 23 27 17 8 and 13 respectively in the fuzzy pso model z3 pistachio allocated 7 of the cultivation area in this model the allocation of cultivated area for cotton was almost 3 due to its low net irrigation compared to grape and the share of grape in cultivation area was insignificant maize had a 2 reduction in its cultivation area in the non fuzzy pso model for z3 compared to its fuzzy model also a 6 increase was obtained for tomatoes in the non fuzzy pso model for z3 compared to its fuzzy optimization fuzzy mopso model presented the proposed cropping pattern with outstanding contributions of wheat barley maize alfalfa tomato and pistachio with a share of 26 21 16 10 20 and 5 respectively whereas the contribution share of these crops were 27 17 17 9 22 and 6 respectively in non fuzzy mopso model as can be seen three added crops grape cotton and pistachio allocated approximately 5 10 of cultivated area demonstrating their profitability in particular pistachio with the highest contribution to the cropping pattern comparing to cotton and grape however fuzzy and non fuzzy pso models for minimizing groundwater withdrawal z3 optimized almost 3 of the cultivated area for cotton due to its low net irrigation compared to pistachio and grape fig 6 on the other hand the tomato has a smaller percentage in fuzzy and non fuzzy pso to maximize the net benefit z1 due to its low profitability in contrast this crop made more than 13 share in other models alfalfa had almost the same percentage in all models overall the fuzzy mopso model indicated a cropping pattern considering uncertainties hence this cropping pattern can be applied for the study area 4 discussion comparison of proposed cropping pattern with five in the previous study and eight crops in this research yousefi et al 2018 conducted a study using multiobjective optimization mopso to propose a cropping pattern for the au sub canal in 2014 2015 with five crops wheat barley maize alfalfa and tomato table 3 compares the results of the present study and previous research the results show that the use of reclaimed wastewater increased to 6 7 mcm whereas only 5 8 mcm of reclaimed wastewater was optimized to be used in the previous research the net benefit per area index irr ha was defined to make an accurate comparison this index is the ratio of the net benefit irr to the total area ha having compared the net benefit per unit area index in both studies the high profitability of three added crops to the cropping pattern is economically significant for farmers thus the value of this was 5e 07 irr ha in the previous study and it increased to 1 82e 08 irr ha this result indicated a 33 6 growth in the net benefit per unit area more importantly considering the existing uncertainties provided a better understanding of the real situation and addressed the problem better table 4 5 conclusion in this research conjunctive reallocation of reclaimed wastewater and groundwater was optimized by applying the fuzzy and non fuzzy pso and mopso algorithms to propose a cropping pattern in the varamin plain under uncertain circumstances considering water shortage in the area the results can be summarized as follows the contribution of reclaimed wastewater for irrigation increased in conjunctive optimization of reclaimed wastewater and groundwater moreover the total water consumption was reduced by proposing an appropriate cropping pattern applying f pso and fuzzy mopso algorithms considering uncertainties fuzzy models produced better optimal results particularly for the net benefit and water consumption efficiency as these models consider uncertain circumstances as the real world furthermore the fuzzy mopso model solved three opposing objective functions the net benefit maximization nitrate leaching and groundwater withdrawal minimization by satisfying all socio economic and environmental aspects for sustainable water management proposing optimal cropping patterns with their proper contribution by single and multi objectively applying algorithms addressed water optimization in the circumstances with uncertainties of parameters and variables overall all fuzzy models significantly improved the current condition comparing to non fuzzy models that prove the importance of considering fuzzy logic in optimization models for sustainable water management the present study significantly improved the net benefit per unit area by proposing the cropping pattern with crops having high profitability compared to previous research the present research has targeted accomplishing objectives with different aspects to solve one of the water management problems especially in the agricultural sector under existing uncertainties whether in system or nature optimizing net benefit nitrate leaching and groundwater withdrawal were considered in presenting the proposed cropping pattern with cost effective use of water reallocation and more minor environmental damage moreover for further development of this study fuzzy stochastic optimization can be considered to trace the path of probabilities in an uncertain condition finally this research can be applied in other regions and can bring improvement in water allocation and cropping patterns in an uncertain situation declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no

9953,as a cash crop potato plays an important role in the economic development and ensuring food security reasonable management of irrigation and fertilization can promote the uptake of water and

irrigation amounts and fertilization rates on potato yield economic benefit tuber quality water productivity wp and fertilizer use efficiency fue and soil nutrient residues during 2016 2019 multi objective optimization of irrigation amount and fertilization rate was conducted based on data in 2018 and 2019 using the analytic hierarchy process and fuzzy comprehensive evaluation methods in 2016

theoretical basis for the optimization of water and fertilizer regimes of potato in northern china and other regions with similar environments keywords potato fertigation wp fue soil nutrient residues ahp fce 1 introduction potato maize wheat and rice are the four major food crops in the world potato is a kind of food and vegetable with rich nutritional values tubers contain a lot of starch and water low amount of fat protein vitamins dietary fiber and carotene zhang 2007 the starch and starch products have been widely used in industrial production xie et al 2001 it plays an important role in providing nutritious foods ensuring food security and promoting agricultural development the temporal and spatial distributions of precipitation in northern china are uneven and most crops need to be irrigated moreover precipitation in different years varies greatly and a reasonable irrigation and fertilization scheduling is necessary for crop production potato is very sensitive to water and fertilizer but irrigation and fertilization methods are still mainly flood irrigation and soil dressing with a small range of sprinkler irrigation in northern china during potato cultivation the water and fertilizer use efficiencies are quite low the integrated control of water and fertilizer can ensure irrigation and fertilization on time and on demand according to the growth of potato this technology can not only improve the tuber yield quality and economic benefit but also reduce the waste of water resources and improve the water and fertilizer use efficiencies chen 2016 zou et al 2020 wang et al 2020 water is one of the main components of plants for photosynthesis and is an important factor affecting the yield and quality of vegetables and fruits reasonable irrigation can not only improve the photosynthetic assimilation ability of crops promote the growth and development of crop groups li and zhang 2011 but also enhance the leaf area index and promote the accumulation and transfer of biomass yang et al 2011 potatoes need to be irrigated in many areas due to the scarce and irregular precipitation wang et al 2020 liu et al 2015 found that the relative moisture content of leaves spad and root activity reduced when the soil water content was above or below 75 85 of the field water holding capacity carli et al 2014 found the reduction of irrigation after the formation of tubers had limited impact on yield but it could significantly enhance water use efficiency and starch content however saue and kadaja 2014 and woli et al 2016 found potato yield and its components were significantly affected by water deficit onder et al 2005 pointed out that water deficit exceeding 33 was not conducive to potato growth in the east mediterranean region li et al 2017 revealed that compared with full irrigation during the whole growth period mild and moderate water deficits occurred at the tuber expansion period and mild water deficit applied at the starch accumulation period lai photosynthetic potential relative growth rate and yield all reduced in short proper irrigation is necessary for high yield and good quality of potato and the key to improve the physiological characteristics of crops potato yield and quality are closely related to fertilization the effects of fertilization on potato growth have been well studied moinuddin et al 2005 zhang et al 2009 hannan et al 2011 kandi et al 2012 li et al 2015 gao et al 2015 neshev and manolov 2015 he et al 2016 wang et al 2016 zewide et al 2016 jiao et al 2018 rens et al 2018 the main conclusions are as follows 1 fertilization could improve potato yield quality water use efficiency and enhance the drought resistance and photosynthetic rate of potato 2 however when the amount of fertilization exceeded a certain threshold yield and quality declined excessive fertilization not only increased the cost but also destroyed the soil structure and improved the risk of soil leaching 3 fertilizer partial productivity decreased with the increase of fertilizer application rate 4 the fertilization time and method fertilizer type and the cooperation between fertilizers had obvious effects on the growth and physiology of potatoes the combination of water and fertilizer is the key factor to ensure high and stable potato production the main reasons are as follows 1 crop yield is determined by the availability of water while the level of yield depends on the rate of fertilizer applied darwish et al 2006 ati et al 2012 song et al 2013 sun et al 2015 fandika et al 2016 zhou et al 2016 yang et al 2017 wang et al 2019a 2019b 2020 2 the nutrients in the soil can only be absorbed and used by plants when they are dissolved in water the diffusion migration of ions and the nutrient concentration in the soil are affected by soil moisture gong 2009 fertilization can promote the growth of roots improve root activity and water absorption capacity li et al 1994 3 water and fertilizer affect the coordination of carbon and nitrogen metabolism in potato leaves which in turn affects the source capacity of plant thereby affecting the yield li 2016 4 potatoes are mostly planted in sandy soils due to high air permeability and looseness but it has poor ability to retain water and fertilizers feng et al 2018 wang et al 2020 in arid regions in order to obtain satisfactory yield save water and fertilizer and maximize resource use efficiency the integrated management of water and fertilizer must be fully explored badr et al 2012 deficit irrigation fertilizer and the coupling effect of water

decrease of irrigation amount besides water expenditure accounted for a small proportion of the total input but the reduction in irrigation amount resulted in a large loss of net income which was also the main reason why farmers were unwilling to save water in 2016 and 2017 we found the tuber yield increased as the amount of fertilizer increased when the irrigation level was the same when the application rate of fertilizer n p k was f3 200 34 9 248 9 kg ha the highest tuber yield was obtained in 2018 and 2019 a higher fertilization rate f4 250 43 7 311 2 kg ha was applied the results showed that there was no significant difference in tuber yield between f3 and f4 under full irrigation level w3 and the difference in the net income between f3 and f4 was not significant the results were consistent with the previous reports within a certain range tuber yield increased with the increase of fertilizer application rate but the yield would not continue to increase or even decreased if the fertilization exceeded a certain threshold song et al 2013 rens et al 2015 wan et al 2016 yang et al 2017 zhou et al 2018 the interactions of irrigation level with fertilization rate had significant effects p 0 05 on the shoot dry matter tuber dry matter lai and spad compared with low water and low fertilizer increasing the water supply in combination with medium and high fertilization rate increased the spad value and lai which consequently promoted dry matter accumulation of shoots and tuber and resulted in a better tuber yield however under full irrigation w3 excessive fertilization resulted in the overgrowth of potato stems and leaves which was not conducive to the increase of tuber yield but also increased the cost under deficit irrigation tuber yield increased with the increase of fertilizer rate this may be due to that fertilization enhanced the drought resistance of potatoes it was found that when water stress was light nutrients could promote the growth and development of crop roots and canopy thus the ability of root system to absorb water and nutrients was enhanced and the net photosynthetic rate of leaves was increased which promoted the formation of photosynthetic products and ultimately increased the yield zhang et al 2007 zhang and zhai 2010 therefore irrigation and fertilization techniques should be organically combined to regulate the distribution of water and nutrients so as to maximize crop yields water productivity could be enhanced by either increasing the crop yield with the same water applied or obtained the same yield with reducing water use and the application of irrigation badr et al 2012 pandey et al 2000 compared with grain and legume crops potatoes own a high water use efficiency of 6 2 11 6 kg m3 zhang et al 2005 fandika et al 2016 some researchers found the potato wp increased as the irrigation level decreased badr et al 2012 song et al 2013 gao 2017 yang et al 2017 however the results of this study showed that the wp of potatoes increased first and then decreased with the decrease of irrigation amount the iwp decreased with the increase of irrigation amount in 2016 2019 under the same fertilization level there was no significant difference in wp between w2 and w3 the reason for this difference may be due to that potatoes under 40 water deficit w1 60 etc in the sandy soil were subjected to water stress although there was a certain amount of precipitation compensation in the middle period the tuber yield was seriously reduced the tuber yield produced by the water consumption increased from 60 etc to 80 etc was greater than that from 80 etc to 100 etc our results were similar with bi 2019 badr et al 2012 found when the irrigation levels were 100 et and 80 et the wp increased as the increase of nitrogen rate 160 340 kg ha similar results were also obtained in our study fertilization promoted the development of potato canopy increased plant transpiration but reduced soil evaporation therefore it increased the ratio of transpiration to evaporation and greatly improved water use efficiency 4 2 tuber quality under various drip irrigation amounts and fertilization rates reasonable water and fertilizer management is very important for potato quality the results of previous studies on the effect of irrigation on potato starch content were inconsistent carli et al 2014 noted the decrease of irrigation enhanced the starch content and decreased vitamin c content wang et al 2020 revealed that the starch content and vitamin c content increased first and then decreased with the decrease of irrigation amount our results were similar with singh et al 2007 song et al 2013 and yang et al 2017 who found the reduction of water supply reduced the starch content of potato the reason for this difference may be due to the different soil texture climate varieties planting time and planting pattern potassium fertilizer had significant effect on potato quality hannan et al 2011 it can promote the transport and synthesis of proteins nucleic acids and carbohydrates especially increase the synthesis of carbohydrates and starch in storage organs su et al 2010 nitrogen is one of the important elements that make up proteins nucleic acids phospholipids chlorophyll enzymes and multiple vitamins zhang 2006 researches showed that the starch content and vitamin c content reached the maximum value at the moderate fertilization level and excessive fertilization caused a decline in quality song et al 2013 chen 2015 wang et al 2017 bi 2019 similar conclusions were also obtained in the present study the starch content and vitamin c content were enhanced by the increase of the water supply combined with a medium fertilization f2 150 26 2 186 7 kg ha while the changing trend of reducing sugar was opposite to starch which may be due to the irrigation and fertilization affected the conversion of sugar to starch 4 3 n p and k accumulation and use efficiency under various drip irrigation amounts and fertilization rates nitrogen n phosphorus p and potassium k are the three essential nutrients for the normal growth and development of potato controlling the application amount of n p and k and coordinating the application proportion of the three nutrients are the primary conditions to ensure the high yield of potato research showed that among the organs root stem leaf and tuber of potato n p and k accumulated most in tuber and least in root at harvest liu 2013 about 70 of n 80 of p and 75 of k were transported to tuber duan et al 2014 besides chen 2011 and gao 2017 found increasing the amount of irrigation and fertilization was beneficial to increase the accumulation of nitrogen phosphorus and potassium similar conclusions were also obtained by us at harvest the accumulation of n p and k in tuber was the largest and the accumulation of n p and k in different organs was tuber leaf stem root the accumulation of n p and k increased with the increase of irrigation and fertilization applied irrigation had significant effects on nitrogen use efficiency and nitrogen fertilizer recovery and deficit irrigation had low nitrogen use efficiency and nitrogen fertilizer recovery darwish et al 2006 badr et al 2012 the pfp of cucumber cotton and potato decreased with the increase of fertilizer rate liang et al 2015 gao 2017 wang et al 2018 2019a 2019b bi 2019 our results were consistent with the finding of previous studies the fue and pfp of potato increased with the increase of irrigation amount with the increase of fertilization amount pfp decreased and fue increased first and then decreased fue showed a quadratic parabolic relationship with fertilizer the interaction of irrigation level with fertilization rate had significant effects on fue and pfp while the irrigation and fertilization had no significant effects on agronomy fertilizer use efficiency afue compared to low irrigation level with no fertilizer increasing the application of water and fertilizer increased the dry matter accumulation and nutrient uptake which consequently promoted the fertilizer use efficiency however when the application of fertilizer exceeded f3 200 34 9 248 9 kg ha the nutrient uptake was not ideal but increased the input of fertilizer which resulted in the decrease of fertilizer use efficiency 4 4 nitrate nitrogen available phosphorus and available potassium accumulation under various drip irrigation amounts and fertilization rates ye et al 2004 revealed that irrigation had a significant effect on the accumulation of nitrate nitrogen in the soil and the change in the accumulation at high irrigation levels was greater than that at low irrigation levels previous studies showed that the contents of nitrate nitrogen available phosphorus and available potassium in the soil increased as the increase of the application rate of fertilizer zhang et al 2019 and decreased as the increase of irrigation amount xing et al 2015 gao 2017 similar results were obtained in our study under the same fertilization level the accumulation of nitrate nitrogen available phosphorus and available potassium in the 0 100 cm soil layer decreased with the increase of irrigation amount when the irrigation levels were same the accumulation of nitrate nitrogen available phosphorus and available potassium increased with the increase of fertilization full irrigation w3 improved the absorption of nutrients in plant thereby reduced the residue of fertilizer in the soil the high fertilizer treatment f4 250 43 7 311 2 kg ha was disadvantageous to environmental benefits although it obtained the high yields it increased the risk of nutrient residue and loss in particular the amount of nitrate nitrogen leaching increased by the increase of nitrogen application rate after heavy rainfall feng et al 2006 while the low fertilizer treatment owned less fertilizer residue but it was not conducive to the yield 4 5 multi objective optimization based on analytic hierarchy process and fuzzy comprehensive evaluation methods wang et al 2019b and rasool et al 2020 used the topsis to conduct the multi objective optimization analysis of potato and tomato quality for water and fertilizer management in their studies the weights of the indicators were set to be equal determining the weight of index is the basis of comprehensive evaluation which determines the rationality and reliability of the evaluation results analytic hierarchy process ahp can combine qualitative and quantitative analysis and make complex problems hierarchical and systematic it has been widely used in the calculation of the weight of the evaluation index system tong et al 2008 jiang et al 2019 however the calculation of weight was based on the questionnaire of experts in the process of ahp calculation which was may be affected by the subjective factors of experts this was also a disadvantage of this paper fuzzy comprehensive evaluation fce is a method of applying fuzzy relation synthesis to quantify some factors with unclear boundaries and difficult to quantify and then carry out comprehensive evaluation du et al 2008 ahp fce has been widely used in the optimization and evaluation of programs in the fields of power energy transportation seawater desalination and engineering xu and zhang 2011 mu et al 2015 yan et al 2019 guo et al 2020 zhang et al 2020 wu et al 2014 evaluated the total water consumption in nanjing through ahp fce jiang et al 2019 rated the performance of typical water saving irrigation technologies in northwest china through the combination of ahp and fce based on economic benefit tuber quality water and fertilizer use efficiency and environmental benefit irrigation and fertilization scheduling was optimized and selected through the ahp fce in the present study when the irrigation level was w3 100 etc and the fertilizer application rate n p k was f3 200 34 9 248 9 kg ha the multi target was optimal among the treatments however the technical optimum values of irrigation and fertilization may be different from the optimal treatment w3f3 which need to be further studied 5 conclusions reasonable water and fertilizer input was conducive to the growth of potato improved the tuber yield and quality and decreased the residual amounts of fertilizer irrigation and fertilization had significant effects on the dry matter tuber yield and quality net income and water productivity and fertilizer use efficiency when the irrigation amount was the same tuber yield net income shoot dry matter tuber dry matter lai spad starch and vitamin c content and water use efficiency all increased with the increase of fertilization rate however under full irrigation 100 etc the differences in tuber yield net income and water productivity between f3 and f4 were not significant besides the fertilizer use efficiency was highest and the tuber quality was optimal under w3f3 and w3f2 respectively the largest water use efficiency was obtained under w2 80 etc but it also had no significant difference from that under w3 100 etc the residual amounts of nitrate nitrogen available phosphorus and available potassium in the soil was decreased by either increasing irrigation amount or decreasing application rate of fertilizer the amounts of irrigation and fertilization were different when each index reached the optimum the multi objective optimization was conducted based on the analytic hierarchy process and fuzzy comprehensive evaluation methods it was concluded that the multi objective high yield quality and efficiency as well as environmentally friendly optimization was obtained when the irrigation level was 100 etc and the fertilizer n p k application rate was 200 34 9 248 9 kg ha in the sandy area of northern china declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing

9953,as a cash crop potato plays an important role in the economic development and ensuring food security reasonable management of irrigation and fertilization can promote the uptake of water and nutrients by potato thereby improving the tuber yield and quality and reducing fertilizer residues in the soil a four year field experiment was carried out to explore the effects of different irrigation amounts and fertilization rates on potato yield economic benefit tuber quality water productivity wp and fertilizer use efficiency fue and soil nutrient residues during 2016 2019 multi objective optimization of irrigation amount and fertilization rate was conducted based on data in 2018 and 2019 using the analytic hierarchy process and fuzzy comprehensive evaluation methods in 2016 and 2017 three irrigation levels w1 60 etc w2 80 etc and w3 100 etc and three fertilization n p k rates f1 100 17 5 124 5 kg ha f2 150 26 2 186 7 kg ha and f3 200 34 9 248 9 kg ha were applied the highest tuber yield was obtained under f3 in 2016 and 2017 two fertilization rates f0 0 kg ha and f4 250 43 7 311 2 kg ha were further considered in 2018 and 2019 results showed that the highest tuber yield net income wp dry matter and the residues accumulation of nitrate nitrogen available phosphorus and available potassium were obtained under f4 in 2018 and 2019 however the differences in tuber yield net income and wp between f3 and f4 were not significant under w3 deficit irrigation reduced tuber yield et net income shoot dry matter tuber dry matter lai relative chlorophyll content starch and vitamin c content and fue and increased the residues of nutrient in the soil and reducing sugar content besides w1 showed the highest irrigation water productivity but the starch and vitamin c content of w3f2 were largest the highest fue was obtained under w3f3 56 33 in 2018 and 53 33 in 2019 increasing fertilization rate decreased the fertilizer partial factor productivity and sink source based on the economic benefit tuber quality wp and fue and soil environmental benefit the multi objective optimization was evaluated by the analytic hierarchy process and fuzzy comprehensive evaluation methods when the irrigation amount was 100 etc w3 and the fertilization rate n p k was 200 34 9 248 9 kg ha f3 the multi objective optimization was obtained the results can provide a theoretical basis for the optimization of water and fertilizer regimes of potato in northern china and other regions with similar environments keywords potato fertigation wp fue soil nutrient residues ahp fce 1 introduction potato maize wheat and rice are the four major food crops in the world potato is a kind of food and vegetable with rich nutritional values tubers contain a lot of starch and water low amount of fat protein vitamins dietary fiber and carotene zhang 2007 the starch and starch products have been widely used in industrial production xie et al 2001 it plays an important role in providing nutritious foods ensuring food security and promoting agricultural development the temporal and spatial distributions of precipitation in northern china are uneven and most crops need to be irrigated moreover precipitation in different years varies greatly and a reasonable irrigation and fertilization scheduling is necessary for crop production potato is very sensitive to water and fertilizer but irrigation and fertilization methods are still mainly flood irrigation and soil dressing with a small range of sprinkler irrigation in northern china during potato cultivation the water and fertilizer use efficiencies are quite low the integrated control of water and fertilizer can ensure irrigation and fertilization on time and on demand according to the growth of potato this technology can not only improve the tuber yield quality and economic benefit but also reduce the waste of water resources and improve the water and fertilizer use efficiencies chen 2016 zou et al 2020 wang et al 2020 water is one of the main components of plants for photosynthesis and is an important factor affecting the yield and quality of vegetables and fruits reasonable irrigation can not only improve the photosynthetic assimilation ability of crops promote the growth and development of crop groups li and zhang 2011 but also enhance the leaf area index and promote the accumulation and transfer of biomass yang et al 2011 potatoes need to be irrigated in many areas due to the scarce and irregular precipitation wang et al 2020 liu et al 2015 found that the relative moisture content of leaves spad and root activity reduced when the soil water content was above or below 75 85 of the field water holding capacity carli et al 2014 found the reduction of irrigation after the formation of tubers had limited impact on yield but it could significantly enhance water use efficiency and starch content however saue and kadaja 2014 and woli et al 2016 found potato yield and its components were significantly affected by water deficit onder et al 2005 pointed out that water deficit exceeding 33 was not conducive to potato growth in the east mediterranean region li et al 2017 revealed that compared with full irrigation during the whole growth period mild and moderate water deficits occurred at the tuber expansion period and mild water deficit applied at the starch accumulation period lai photosynthetic potential relative growth rate and yield all reduced in short proper irrigation is necessary for high yield and good quality of potato and the key to improve the physiological characteristics of crops potato yield and quality are closely related to fertilization the effects of fertilization on potato growth have been well studied moinuddin et al 2005 zhang et al 2009 hannan et al 2011 kandi et al 2012 li et al 2015 gao et al 2015 neshev and manolov 2015 he et al 2016 wang et al 2016 zewide et al 2016 jiao et al 2018 rens et al 2018 the main conclusions are as follows 1 fertilization could improve potato yield quality water use efficiency and enhance the drought resistance and photosynthetic rate of potato 2 however when the amount of fertilization exceeded a certain threshold yield and quality declined excessive fertilization not only increased the cost but also destroyed the soil structure and improved the risk of soil leaching 3 fertilizer partial productivity decreased with the increase of fertilizer application rate 4 the fertilization time and method fertilizer type and the cooperation between fertilizers had obvious effects on the growth and physiology of potatoes the combination of water and fertilizer is the key factor to ensure high and stable potato production the main reasons are as follows 1 crop yield is determined by the availability of water while the level of yield depends on the rate of fertilizer applied darwish et al 2006 ati et al 2012 song et al 2013 sun et al 2015 fandika et al 2016 zhou et al 2016 yang et al 2017 wang et al 2019a 2019b 2020 2 the nutrients in the soil can only be absorbed and used by plants when they are dissolved in water the diffusion migration of ions and the nutrient concentration in the soil are affected by soil moisture gong 2009 fertilization can promote the growth of roots improve root activity and water absorption capacity li et al 1994 3 water and fertilizer affect the coordination of carbon and nitrogen metabolism in potato leaves which in turn affects the source capacity of plant thereby affecting the yield li 2016 4 potatoes are mostly planted in sandy soils due to high air permeability and looseness but it has poor ability to retain water and fertilizers feng et al 2018 wang et al 2020 in arid regions in order to obtain satisfactory yield save water and fertilizer and maximize resource use efficiency the integrated management of water and fertilizer must be fully explored badr et al 2012 deficit irrigation fertilizer and the coupling effect of water and single fertilizer nitrogen phosphorus or potassium on potato growth have been well studied however few studies have focused on the interacting effects of irrigation amount along with n p and k rates and ratio on the potato growth under drip fertigation the analytic hierarchy process ahp method was proposed by saaty 1977 which is widely used in business and management it is a decision making method that combines the qualitative and quantitative analysis and is used to calculate the weight of evaluation index system heindl and liefner 2019 han et al 2020 the fuzzy comprehensive evaluation fce method is an evaluation method based on fuzzy mathematics which can convert qualitative evaluation into quantitative according to the membership theory of fuzzy mathematics zadeh 1976 han and he 2010 han et al 2019 the objects of this paper were to 1 explore the coupling effects of different irrigation levels and fertilization rates on the dry matter accumulation tuber yield tuber quality economic benefits water and fertilizer use efficiency and soil nutrient residues and 2 establish a high yield quality and efficiency and environmentally friendly evaluation index system for potato and to optimize the multiple objectives using the ahp fce method this study is expected to provide a reference for the establishment of potato irrigation and fertilization system 2 materials and methods 2

replicates per treatment spss statistical product and service solutions software was used to carry out the analysis of variance anova with the general linear model univariate procedure anovas were performed with irrigation level fertilization rate and year as the main effects including one two and three way interactions the irrigation fertilization and year were set as fixed factor duncan s multiple range tests at a significance level of p 0 05 was used to compare the any significant differences of all treatment means 3 results 3 1 tuber yield et water productivity and irrigation water productivity year fertilization and year fertilization had a significant effects on tuber yield p 0 05 in 2016 and 2017 when the application of fertilizer was f3 the highest tuber yield was obtained therefore a higher fertilization rate f4 was applied in 2018 and 2019 under the same irrigation level the tuber yield increased with the increase of fertilizer rate applied in the four years however the difference in tuber yield between f3 and f4 under full irrigation w3 in 2018 and 2019 was not significant but they were significantly higher than that of the other three fertilization rates f0 f1 and f2 compared with the yield of f0 the tuber yields of f1 f2 f3 and f4 were increased by 42 35 59 14 75 85 and 91 15 in 2018 and 55 38 78 68 96 96 and 113 18 in 2019 under w1 respectively under w2

significant p 0 05 but year irrigation had no significant effect on tuber yield p 0 05 when the fertilization rate was the same the yield decreased with the decrease of irrigation amount and there were significant differences in yield between the three irrigation levels during 2016 2019 the irrigation fertilization and year irrigation fertilization had no significant effect on tuber yield p 0 05 compared with low irrigation amount with no fertilizer w1f0 increasing the amount of irrigation or fertilization was conducive to higher yields table 4 the effects of year fertilization and year fertilization on wp and irrigation water productivity iwp were significant p 0 05 but the effects of year fertilization on water consumption et were not significant p 0 05 table 4 due to the different climate conditions in each year et in 2016 was least and that in 2018 was greatest under the same irrigation level the difference in et between the fertilization levels was minimal however wp and iwp increased with the increasing fertilizer rate and the highest wp and iwp were obtained by the maximum fertilizer treatment during 2016 2019 the differences in wp and iwp among the fertilization levels were significant under the two deficit irrigation levels w1 and w2 in the four years however when the irrigation level was w3 the differences in wp and iwp between f3 and f4 were not significant in 2018 and 2019 the effect of irrigation on et wp and iwp were significant p 0 05 but there was no significant effect of year irrigation fertilization on wp and iwp p 0 05 under the same fertilization rate et increased with the increase of irrigation amount but iwp decreased with the increase of irrigation amount during 2016 2019 under f3 and f4 no significant difference existed in wp between w1

of year fertilization and year fertilization on starch content and vitamin c content were significant p 0 05 table 5 under deficit irrigation w1 and w2 the starch content and vitamin c content of f3 were highest and it was significantly higher than that of the other fertilization treatments during 2016 2019 however under the full irrigation the starch content and vitamin c content of f2 14 91 and

content between f2 and f3 was not significant in 2016 2018 and 2019 in 2018 and 2019 the starch content and vitamin c content increased first and then decreased with the increase of fertilizer rate the effects of irrigation year irrigation irrigation fertilization on starch content and vitamin c content were also significant p 0 05 under the same fertilization rate the starch and vitamin c content increased with the increase of irrigation amount in 2018 compared with w1 the starch content of w2 was increased by 0 38 1 32 1 14 1 81 and 0 71 and the starch content of w3 was increased by 2

87 and 3 50 respectively compared with the treatment of w1f0 a higher starch and vitamin c content could be obtained by appropriately increasing irrigation amount or fertilization rate table 5 the year irrigation fertilization the two and three way interactions had significant effects on reducing sugar content p 0 05 table 5 under deficit irrigation the reducing sugar content decreased with the increase of the fertilizer rate applied in 2016 2019 however it decreased first and then increased with the increase of the fertilizer rate under full irrigation in 2018 and 2019 under the same irrigation level the reduction in sugar content under f0 was significantly higher than that under the other four fertilization treatments under the same fertilizer level the reduction in sugar content decreased with the increase of irrigation amount in the four years table 5 the year irrigation and fertilization had significant effects on gross yield and net income p 0 05 table 6 the gross yield were 29 944 45 889 cny ha in 2016 28 746 46 572 cny ha in 2017 21 269 51 740 cny ha in 2018 and 19 633 51 335 cny ha in 2019 respectively table 6 compared with the lowest gross yield under f0 the highest gross yields were increased by 143 and 161 in 2018 and 2019 respectively the lowest net income were 9723 and 7973 cny ha and the highest were 34 753 and 34 124 cny ha in 2018 and 2019 respectively the difference in net income was 3 5 times which showed that unreasonable water and fertilizer management not only affected the gross income but also caused the net income to decrease in 2018 and 2019 compared with the water fee of w3 the water fee of w1 was only saved 297 6 and 387 2 cny ha under the same irrigation level the net income increased with the increase of fertilizer input in 2016 2019 but the difference in the net income between f3 and f4 was not significant in 2018 and 2019 however excessively high fertilizer input deteriorated the soil structure and polluted the environment table 6 3 3 shoot dry matter tuber dry matter sink source lai and spad the effects of year irrigation and year irrigation on shoot dry matter tuber dry matter sink source lai and relative chlorophyll content spad were significant p 0 05 regardless of fertilization rate the highest shoot dry matter 4 52 and 4 25 t ha tuber dry matter 8 58 and 8 86 t ha lai 4 42 and 3 91 m2 m2 and spad 42 92 and 40 53 were obtained by full irrigation level w3 100 etc in 2018 and 2019 respectively however the highest sink source 3 25 and 5 06 was attained by the deficit irrigation in the two years when the same fertilization rate was applied the shoot dry matter tuber dry matter lai and spad decreased with the decrease of irrigation amounts the shoot dry matter tuber dry matter lai and spad of w3 were significantly higher than that of the two deficit irrigation treatments table 7 fertilization and year fertilization had significant effects p 0 05 on the shoot dry matter tuber dry matter sink source lai and spad table 7 under w1 there was no significant difference in shoot dry matter tuber dry matter lai and spad between f3 and f4 but they were significantly higher than that of the other three fertilization treatments in 2018 in 2019 the shoot dry matter and lai of f4 were significantly higher than that of f0 f1 f2 and f3 under w2 shoot dry matter tuber dry matter lai and spad of f4 were highest but there was no significant difference in spad between f3 and f4 in the two years under w3 no significant difference existed between f3 and f4 in tuber dry matter and spad regardless of the irrigation level the sink source of f0 was significantly higher than that of the fertilization treatments the sink source of w3f3 1 87 in 2018 and w3f4 2 00 in 2019 were lowest the interactions of irrigation with fertilization and year irrigation fertilization also had significant effects p 0 05 on the shoot dry matter tuber dry matter lai and spad compared with the treatment of low irrigation amount and no fertilizer w1f0 increasing the amount of irrigation or fertilization was conducive to increase shoot dry matter tuber dry matter lai and spad compared with irrigation fertilization played a more important role in enhancing the growth of potato 3 4 n p and k uptake and fertilizer use efficiency the total nitrogen n phosphorus p and potassium k accumulation in the whole plant of each treatment were 59 9 188 9 kg ha 14 4 36 5 kg ha and 103 7 390 8 kg ha in 2018 and 43 0 146 2 kg ha 12 8 35 6 kg ha and 95 0 347 5 kg ha in 2019 respectively with the transport of nutrients and the shedding of leaves at harvest the amount of n p and k accumulation in leaves and stems decreased the n p and k accumulation in tuber were largest accounting for 58 73 77 86 and 52 70 of the whole plant in 2018 and 61 85 75 94 and 56 83 in 2019 respectively the n p and k accumulation in roots were smallest under the same fertilization level the total n p and k accumulation increased with the increase of irrigation amount when the full irrigation was applied in 2018 the n and k accumulation in the whole plant were largest under f4 but the p accumulation of f3 was highest and the difference in the p and k accumulation in plant and tuber between f3 and f4 was not significant under w2 and w3 in 2019 the n p and k accumulation in tuber of f3 were highest fig 5 year fertilization and year fertilization and year irrigation fertilization had significant effects on fertilizer use efficiency fue table 8 regardless of irrigation level fertilizer use efficiency increased first and then decreased with the increase of fertilizer rate the fue of f3 was significantly higher than that of the other three fertilizer treatments in 2018 and 2019 the relationship between fue and fertilizer application was quadratic parabola fig 6 the effects of irrigation year irrigation and irrigation fertilization on fue were significant p 0 05 under the same fertilization level the fue increased with the increase of irrigation amount and there were significant differences in fue among the three irrigation levels compared with w1 the fue of w2 was increased by 5 97 11 52 14 04 and 39 42 and that of w3 increased by 19 00 29 11 38 80 and 53 40 in 2018 respectively in 2019 the fue of w3 increased by 43 56 41 37 36 71 and 23 74 compared with that of w1 table 8 the irrigation fertilization and the interaction of water with fertilizer had significant effects on fertilizer partial factor productivity pfp table 8 under the three irrigation levels pfp decreased with the increase of fertilization rate fig 6 pfp of f1 was significantly higher than that of other fertilization treatments at the same fertilization level pfp increased with the increase of irrigation amount pfp of w3 was significantly higher than that of w1 and w2 in the order of w3 w2 w1 table 8 except for the year the other one two and three way had no significant effects on agronomic fertilizer use efficiency afue there was no significant difference in afue among the treatments the afue of w3f3 was highest 38 00 kg kg in 2018 while the afue of w3f1 was highest 48 76 kg kg in 2019 table 8 3 5 nitrate nitrogen available phosphorus and available potassium accumulation nitrate nitrogen available phosphorus and available phosphorus were mainly concentrated in 0 40 cm soil layer when the irrigation level was the same the accumulation of nitrate nitrogen available phosphorus and available potassium 0 100 cm increased with the increase of fertilizer rate in 2018 and 2019 there were significant differences in nitrate nitrogen accumulation between fertilization levels and the nitrate nitrogen accumulation of f4 was significantly higher than that of the other four fertilization treatments fig 7a b compared with f0 the average available phosphorus accumulation of f1 f2 f3 and f4 was increased by 25 40 39 67 60 71 and 81 08 in 2018 and 26 39 37 86 57 66 and 83 47 in 2019 respectively fig 7c d under w1 and w2 there was no significant difference in available potassium accumulation between f1 f2 and f3 under w3 there was no significant difference in available potassium accumulation between f3 and f4 fig 7e f when the fertilization level was the same the accumulation of nitrate nitrogen available phosphorus and available potassium decreased with the increase of irrigation amount 3 6 evaluation of water and fertilizer coupling effect based on ahp and fuzzy comprehensive evaluation yield and economic benefits are the goals pursued by farmers but they lack a precise irrigation and fertilization management model in water scarce areas high water and fertilizer use efficiency is the key to the sustainable development of agriculture unreasonable input of water and fertilizer will cause an increase in costs waste of fertilizer resources and deterioration of the soil structure quality is an important indicator of potato production and edibility therefore this paper aims to optimize potato economic benefit quality water and fertilizer use efficiency and soil environmental benefit ten experts in the fields of water saving irrigation and efficient use of crop water and fertilizer were consulted the total weight matrix a 0 121 0 362 0 056 0 009 0 023 0 078 0 078 0 091 0 091 0 091 table 9 after consistency test ci and cr of each

and soil environmental benefits the best irrigation and fertilization combination in the sandy area of northern china was the irrigation level of 100 etc and the fertilization rate n p k of 200 34 9 248 9 kg ha 4 discussion 4 1 plant growth tuber yield net income and wp under various drip irrigation amounts and fertilization rates as a shallow root crop potato is sensitive to water el abedin et al 2017 the lack of water and nutrients in sandy soils limits the yield of potato tubers wang et al 2020 studies showed that potato transpiration and growth rate declined when the water deficit exceeded the maximum allowable soil moisture deficit of 35 greenwood et al 2010 therefore an accurate management of water and fertilizer is essential for the growth of potatoes many researchers have found the deficit irrigation reduced the lai aboveground dry matter tuber dry matter and tuber fresh yield compared to full irrigation onder et al 2005 camargo et al 2015 kifle and gebretsadikan 2016 ierna and mauromicale 2018 elhani et al 2019 martínez romero et al 2019 when the potato was subjected to drought stress the leaf chloroplast was damaged and the net photosynthetic rate stomatal conductance transpiration rate and intercellular co2 concentration of the leaf all decreased and then it had an impact on the yield hai et al 2014 zhang et al 2015 similar conclusions have also been obtained in our study irrigation level had significant effects on the dry matter lai spad and tuber yield the shoot dry matter tuber dry matter lai spad tuber yield and net income decreased with the decrease of irrigation amount besides water expenditure accounted for a small proportion of the total input but the reduction in irrigation amount resulted in a large loss of net income which was also the main reason why farmers were unwilling to save water in 2016 and 2017 we found the tuber yield increased as the amount of fertilizer increased when the irrigation level was the same when the application rate of fertilizer n p k was f3 200 34 9 248 9 kg ha the highest tuber yield was obtained in 2018 and 2019 a higher fertilization rate f4 250 43 7 311 2 kg ha was applied the results showed that there was no significant difference in tuber yield between f3 and f4 under full irrigation level w3 and the difference in the net income between f3 and f4 was not significant the results were consistent with the previous reports within a certain range tuber yield increased with the increase of fertilizer application rate but the yield would not continue to increase or even decreased if the fertilization exceeded a certain threshold song et al 2013 rens et al 2015 wan et al 2016 yang et al 2017 zhou et al 2018 the interactions of irrigation level with fertilization rate had significant effects p 0 05 on the shoot dry matter tuber dry matter lai and spad compared with low water and low fertilizer increasing the water supply in combination with medium and high fertilization rate increased the spad value and lai which consequently promoted dry matter accumulation of shoots and tuber and resulted in a better tuber yield however under full irrigation w3 excessive fertilization resulted in the overgrowth of potato stems and leaves which was not conducive to the increase of tuber yield but also increased the cost under deficit irrigation tuber yield increased with the increase of fertilizer rate this may be due to that fertilization enhanced the drought resistance of potatoes it was found that when water stress was light nutrients could promote the growth and development of crop roots and canopy thus the ability of root system to absorb water and nutrients was enhanced and the net photosynthetic rate of leaves was increased which promoted the formation of photosynthetic products and ultimately increased the yield zhang et al 2007 zhang and zhai 2010 therefore irrigation and fertilization techniques should be organically combined to regulate the distribution of water and nutrients so as to maximize crop yields water productivity could be enhanced by either increasing the crop yield with the same water applied or obtained the same yield with reducing water use and the application of irrigation badr et al 2012 pandey et al 2000 compared with grain and legume crops potatoes own a high water use efficiency of 6 2 11 6 kg m3 zhang et al 2005 fandika et al 2016 some researchers found the potato wp increased as the irrigation level decreased badr et al 2012 song et al 2013 gao 2017 yang et al 2017 however the results of this study showed that the wp of potatoes increased first and then decreased with the decrease of irrigation amount the iwp decreased with the increase of irrigation amount in 2016 2019 under the same fertilization level there was no significant difference in wp between w2 and w3 the reason for this difference may be due to that potatoes under 40 water deficit w1 60 etc in the sandy soil were subjected to water stress although there was a certain amount of precipitation compensation in the middle period the tuber yield was seriously reduced the tuber yield produced by the water consumption increased from 60 etc to 80 etc was greater than that from 80 etc to 100 etc our results were similar with bi 2019 badr et al 2012 found when the irrigation levels were 100 et and 80 et the wp increased as the increase of nitrogen rate 160 340 kg ha similar results were also obtained in our study fertilization promoted the development of potato canopy increased plant transpiration but reduced soil evaporation therefore it increased the ratio of transpiration to evaporation and greatly improved water use efficiency 4 2 tuber quality under various drip irrigation amounts and fertilization rates reasonable water and fertilizer management is very important for potato quality the results of previous studies on the effect of irrigation on potato starch content were inconsistent carli et al 2014 noted the decrease of irrigation enhanced the starch content and decreased vitamin c content wang et al 2020 revealed that the starch content and vitamin c content increased first and then decreased with the decrease of irrigation amount our results were similar with singh et al 2007 song et al 2013 and yang et al 2017 who found the reduction of water supply reduced the starch content of potato the reason for this difference may be due to the different soil texture climate varieties planting time and planting pattern potassium fertilizer had significant effect on potato quality hannan et al 2011 it can promote the transport and synthesis of proteins nucleic acids and carbohydrates especially increase the synthesis of carbohydrates and starch in storage organs su et al 2010 nitrogen is one of the important elements that make up proteins nucleic acids phospholipids chlorophyll enzymes and multiple vitamins zhang 2006 researches showed that the starch content and vitamin c content reached the maximum value at the moderate fertilization level and excessive fertilization caused a decline in quality song et al 2013 chen 2015 wang et al 2017 bi 2019 similar conclusions were also obtained in the present study the starch content and vitamin c content were enhanced by the increase of the water supply combined with a medium fertilization f2 150 26 2 186 7 kg ha while the changing trend of reducing sugar was opposite to starch which may be due to the irrigation and fertilization affected the conversion of sugar to starch 4 3 n p and k accumulation and use efficiency under various drip irrigation amounts and fertilization rates nitrogen n phosphorus p and potassium k are the three essential nutrients for the normal growth and development of potato controlling the application amount of n p and k and coordinating the application proportion of the three nutrients are the primary conditions to ensure the high yield of potato research showed that among the organs root stem leaf and tuber of potato n p and k accumulated most in tuber and least in root at harvest liu 2013 about 70 of n 80 of p and 75 of k were transported to tuber duan et al 2014 besides chen 2011 and gao 2017 found increasing the amount of irrigation and fertilization was beneficial to increase the accumulation of nitrogen phosphorus and potassium similar conclusions were also obtained by us at harvest the accumulation of n p and k in tuber was the largest and the accumulation of n p and k in different organs was tuber leaf stem root the accumulation of n p and k increased with the increase of irrigation and fertilization applied irrigation had significant effects on nitrogen use efficiency and nitrogen fertilizer recovery and deficit irrigation had low nitrogen use efficiency and nitrogen fertilizer recovery darwish et al 2006 badr et al 2012 the pfp of cucumber cotton and potato decreased with the increase of fertilizer rate liang et al 2015 gao 2017 wang et al 2018 2019a 2019b bi 2019 our results were consistent with the finding of previous studies the fue and pfp of potato increased with the increase of irrigation amount with the increase of fertilization amount pfp decreased and fue increased first and then decreased fue showed a quadratic parabolic relationship with fertilizer the interaction of irrigation level with fertilization rate had significant effects on fue and pfp while the irrigation and fertilization had no significant effects on agronomy fertilizer use efficiency afue compared to low irrigation level with no fertilizer increasing the application of water and fertilizer increased the dry matter accumulation and nutrient uptake which consequently promoted the fertilizer use efficiency however when the application of fertilizer exceeded f3 200 34 9 248 9 kg ha the nutrient uptake was not ideal but increased the input of fertilizer which resulted in the decrease of fertilizer use efficiency 4 4 nitrate nitrogen available phosphorus and available potassium accumulation under various drip irrigation amounts and fertilization rates ye et al 2004 revealed that irrigation had a significant effect on the accumulation of nitrate nitrogen in the soil and the change in the accumulation at high irrigation levels was greater than that at low irrigation levels previous studies showed that the contents of nitrate nitrogen available phosphorus and available potassium in the soil increased as the increase of the application rate of fertilizer zhang et al 2019 and decreased as the increase of irrigation amount xing et al 2015 gao 2017 similar results were obtained in our study under the same fertilization level the accumulation of nitrate nitrogen available phosphorus and available potassium in the 0 100 cm soil layer decreased with the increase of irrigation amount when the irrigation levels were same the accumulation of nitrate nitrogen available phosphorus and available potassium increased with the increase of fertilization full irrigation w3 improved the absorption of nutrients in plant thereby reduced the residue of fertilizer in the soil the high fertilizer treatment f4 250 43 7 311 2 kg ha was disadvantageous to environmental benefits although it obtained the high yields it increased the risk of nutrient residue and loss in particular the amount of nitrate nitrogen leaching increased by the increase of nitrogen application rate after heavy rainfall feng et al 2006 while the low fertilizer treatment owned less fertilizer residue but it was not conducive to the yield 4 5 multi objective optimization based on analytic hierarchy process and fuzzy comprehensive evaluation methods wang et al 2019b and rasool et al 2020 used the topsis to conduct the multi objective optimization analysis of potato and tomato quality for water and fertilizer management in their studies the weights of the indicators were set to be equal determining the weight of index is the basis of comprehensive evaluation which determines the rationality and reliability of the evaluation results analytic hierarchy process ahp can combine qualitative and quantitative analysis and make complex problems hierarchical and systematic it has been widely used in the calculation of the weight of the evaluation index system tong et al 2008 jiang et al 2019 however the calculation of weight was based on the questionnaire of experts in the process of ahp calculation which was may be affected by the subjective factors of experts this was also a disadvantage of this paper fuzzy comprehensive evaluation fce is a method of applying fuzzy relation synthesis to quantify some factors with unclear boundaries and difficult to quantify and then carry out comprehensive evaluation du et al 2008 ahp fce has been widely used in the optimization and evaluation of programs in the fields of power energy transportation seawater desalination and engineering xu and zhang 2011 mu et al 2015 yan et al 2019 guo et al 2020 zhang et al 2020 wu et al 2014 evaluated the total water consumption in nanjing through ahp fce jiang et al 2019 rated the performance of typical water saving irrigation technologies in northwest china through the combination of ahp and fce based on economic benefit tuber quality water and fertilizer use efficiency and environmental benefit irrigation and fertilization scheduling was optimized and selected through the ahp fce in the present study when the irrigation level was w3 100 etc and the fertilizer application rate n p k was f3 200 34 9 248 9 kg ha the multi target was optimal among the treatments however the technical optimum values of irrigation and fertilization may be different from the optimal treatment w3f3 which need to be further studied 5 conclusions reasonable water and fertilizer input was conducive to the growth of potato improved the tuber yield and quality and decreased the residual amounts of fertilizer irrigation and fertilization had significant effects on the dry matter tuber yield and quality net income and water productivity and fertilizer use efficiency when the irrigation amount was the same tuber yield net income shoot dry matter tuber dry matter lai spad starch and vitamin c content and water use efficiency all increased with the increase of fertilization rate however under full irrigation 100 etc the differences in tuber yield net income and water productivity between f3 and f4 were not significant besides the fertilizer use efficiency was highest and the tuber quality was optimal under w3f3 and w3f2 respectively the largest water use efficiency was obtained under w2 80 etc but it also had no significant difference from that under w3 100 etc the residual amounts of nitrate nitrogen available phosphorus and available potassium in the soil was decreased by either increasing irrigation amount or decreasing application rate of fertilizer the amounts of irrigation and fertilization were different when each index reached the optimum the multi objective optimization was conducted based on the analytic hierarchy process and fuzzy comprehensive evaluation methods it was concluded that the multi objective high yield quality and efficiency as well as environmentally friendly optimization was obtained when the irrigation level was 100 etc and the fertilizer n p k application rate was 200 34 9 248 9 kg ha in the sandy area of northern china declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing

9954,this study investigated the transport of 9 pesticides in surface and subsurface irrigation return flow from a container plant production system over 3 16 day monitoring periods pesticides were applied 3 times during the year and the pesticides were selected to provide a range of physiochemical properties pesticides are most commonly transported in water and irrigation return flow is a driving factor therefore irrigation methods were investigated to determine effects on irrigation return flow volume and transport of pesticides a control overhead irrigation and two treatments irrigating based on substrate volumetric moisture content θ were used pesticide transport in irrigation return flow was related to days after application physiochemical properties and irrigation method additionally pesticide transport was disproportionately reduced in respect to physiochemical properties in subsurface irrigation return flow in response to irrigation methods θ based irrigation treatments reduced irrigation volume applied by 49 and 77 compared to the control leading to a reduction in the volume of surface irrigation return flow by 71 and 92 the θ based treatments reduced the total surface and subsurface volume of irrigation return flow by 52 and 78 versus the control in most cases pesticides movement in surface irrigation return flow exhibited a linear or quadratic decrease for the control while pesticide movement via subsurface irrigation return flow was related more to physiochemical properties limiting mobility rather than irrigation return flow volume or irrigation practice this study demonstrates pesticide movement in irrigation return flow can be substantially reduced by selecting pesticides with low solubility high adsorption coefficients whenever

properties of each compound surface irf is capable of transporting both soluble and insoluble pesticides whereas insoluble pesticides which typically possess greater sorption coefficients are unlikely

mobility water quality water security water management 1 introduction off site transport of potentially harmful agrichemicals by irrigation return flow irf or reintroduction in recycled water is of increasing concern in regards to water security irf is the volume of irrigation water applied that is subsequently lost to surface runoff or subsurface infiltration this irf water may or may not be contained on site allowing it to contribute to non point source pollution particularly input intensive forms of agriculture such as container crop production may result in greater risk without proper management pesticides are critical to maintaining pest free aesthetically appealing crops with herbicides insecticides and fungicides typically applied multiple times per year the frequent oftentimes daily irrigation common in container crop production is likely to result in pesticides being transported off site in irf both surface and subsurface pesticide degradation encompasses a range of processes including photolysis microbial metabolization and volatilization however pesticides may exhibit high degrees of mobility in container crop production as water is the primary transporter of agrochemicals and be transported before degradation occurs abdi and fernandez 2019 vryzas 2018 pesticides represent a critical component in modern agriculture however their widespread use across numerous agricultural sectors increase risk of export to water bodies martins et al 2020 nie et al 2020 within the ornamental crop industry over 350 modes of action spanning several pesticide and chemical classes were used in 2009 usda 2011 pesticides vary within and between classes with respect to physiochemical properties such as solubility sorption coefficients and vapor pressure all of which contribute to the likely environmental fate of a particular compound von merey et al 2016 highly soluble pesticides are likely to dissolve and move in water whereas pesticides with high sorption coefficients are more prone to movement in a particulate or suspended phase sorptive processes depend on the properties of a particular compound and organic inorganic composition within the soil yen et al 2000 pesticides lost from production areas via irf can contaminate water resources and may be toxic to local biota pesticide loss from production areas may limit the effectiveness with which applied compounds control for pests bearing financial implications for growers if resulting in crop loss due to reduced quality or mortality in agricultural operations collecting irf for recycled irrigation use pesticide residues particularly herbicides may be present in bioactive levels that may damage crops poudyal and cregg 2019 container crop production provides many advantages including improved homogeneity of growing conditions easier movement of plants increased production density and faster growth agro and zheng 2014 majsztrik et al 2017 however producing plants in containers has unique challenges limitations dictated by container volume substrate hydraulic properties and plant evapotranspiration can rapidly deplete substrate stored water necessitating frequent oftentimes

this practice is often used for crops produced in larger containers or crops spaced in low densities garber et al 2002 sensors that measure substrate volumetric moisture content θ can also be used to apply irrigation more precisely incrocci et al 2019 lea cox et al 2013 warsaw et al 2009 demonstrated overhead irrigation applied based on replenishing 100 and 75 of crop water use reduced irrigation volumes by 45 and 59 compared to a control of 190 m3 ha 1 d 1 reducing surface irf generation by 66 and 79 this study investigated movement of nine pesticides varying in physiochemical properties and mobility classes and partitioning between irrigation surface and subsurface irf when using either overhead systems or micro irrigation systems spray stakes applying water based on θ compared to a typical 190 m3 ha 1 d 1 practice within a model nursery we hypothesized 1 reducing water application volume would reduce irf and pesticide movement 2 reducing eliminating non target water interception would further reduce irf and pesticide movement 3 that irrigating more efficiently would affect surface irf more than subsurface irf 4 more water and pesticides would move in surface than subsurface irf and 5 early reductions in irf and pesticide movement would result in overall reductions in total pesticide movement 2 materials and methods 2 1 research nursery a research nursery was constructed at the michigan state university horticulture and teaching research center htrc in holt mi latitude 42 67 longitude 84 48 with sixteen raised beds for replicates the experimental raised beds were arranged in two parallel rectangular blocks measuring 61 7 62 m each with the length running north to south and separated by a 1 8 m alley each rectangular block was divided into eight individual 7 62 7 62 0 6 m lxwxh beds for a total of 16 experimental beds abdi et al 2021 the experimental nursery was designed to collect all of the surface and subsurface return flow of each individual bed therefore the existing soil within each raised bed was graded in a manner to funnel water to a low point within each bed the center point of the outside wall of each raised bed native soil within individual beds was graded to a 2 slope towards a center swale funneling water to the outer eastern or western edge of each bed within the two rectangular blocks a 7 62 cm diameter hole was drilled at this low point in order to allow water to exit a 9 1 9 1 m impermeable ethylene propylene diene monomer pondliner firestone pondgard 45mil 1 14 mm nashville tn usa was placed over the graded sub base and up the interior walls over the pond liner 0 3 m of washed natural sand clay free with particle size range of 0 75 9 5 mm was placed and graded in the same manner as the soil sub base and covered with black woven polypropylene landscape fabric de witt sblt6300 sikeston mo usa at the low point where the sand fabric layer was graded towards another 7 62 cm diameter hole was drilled this allowed water that is lost to surface return flow to exit over the fabric layer whereas all water that infiltrated and percolated through the sand layer would be collected within the individual bed and would drain through the sub base drain hole bulkhead fittings were installed in both the surface and subsurface return flow holes providing a water tight seal with plumbing connections to individual 378 l polyethylene tanks duracast manufacturer number 900100 1 2 lake wales fl usa via 4 03 cm inside diameter schedule 40 pvc for collection of surface and subsurface irf collection tanks were buried 15 2 cm below soil level and anchored with concrete 2 2 plant material a total of 15 16 beds were used to produce plants with one bed serving as a blank where no plants were used individual raised beds had 81 plants split between four taxa and produced in 11 3 l containers the four taxa used in this study were cornus sericea l farrow hydrangea paniculata sieb limelight rosa x lindl meipeporia and spiraea japonica l smnsjmfp received from a commercial propagation nursery spring meadow nursery grand haven mi the order of placement on each raised bed was randomly assigned with plants maintained in groups by taxa fertilizer applications of 61 4 g per container 4973 g per bed of a 17 3 2 10 formulation 17 nitrogen from ammonium nitrate 3 2 phosphorus from ammonium phosphate 10 potassium from soluble potash with secondary and micronutrients and a 5 6 month longevity at 27 c harrell s lakeland fl usa were applied on 11 june 2018 2 3 irrigation installation all beds were fitted with 89 µm

flow rate 12 1 l h 1 tel aviv yafo israel overhead sprinklers were located at the corners of the 6 1 6 1 m area within each bed while spray stake irrigated beds also had a manifold of four 6 1 m sections of polyethylene tubing adjacent to plant rows providing water for spray stakes 2 4 irrigation control and sensor installation all irrigation systems were managed via wireless sensor and control network using sensorweb software mayim llc pittsburgh pa usa with computer communication devices installed in the main htrc building solenoid valves were controlled via direct current battery powered nodes model nc24 meter group inc pullman wa usa with each node controlling four beds nodes were installed on the side wall of the western raised beds and oriented towards the communication devices in the htrc building capacitance substrate moisture sensors model 10hs meter group inc connected to monitoring nodes model em50r meter group inc were used to monitor θ the percentage corresponding to the volume of water within a volume of substrate or m3 water m3 substrate where each bed had four moisture sensors set to take measurements at 5 min intervals sensors were randomly assigned to one plant per taxa per bed inserted horizontally into the substrate 24 cm below the top rim of the container to go through the middle of the container 2 5 irrigation treatments a control overhead irrigation applying 190 m3 ha 1 d 1 was compared to two irrigation treatments irrigating based on θ one via overhead application oh and the other using spray stakes ss container capacity cc was assessed for each bed prior to treatment initiation with irrigation treatments intended to return θ to cc a pine bark peat moss blend 85 15 v v pb and a pine bark coconut coir mix 80 20 v v pbc were the substrates used in this study renewed earth otsego mi usa measured cc of both substrates was 38 the study was organized with five distinct combinations one control four treatments each with three replicates control pb oh pb oh pbc ss pb ss pbc for data analysis reasons explained in section 2 9 the substrate factor was removed from the analysis of variance procedures therefore beds were only assessed pooled by irrigation method control n 3 oh n 6 ss n 6 for the overhead irrigated beds based on θ up to 190 m3 ha 1 d 1 was applied split over three separate 63 3 m3 ha 1 cycles allowing five minutes to elapse between cycles to allow for θ readings ss beds irrigated based on cc would irrigate up to three 1 l per container cycles again with five minutes between cycles for θ readings if θ was at cc irrigation would not be applied either at the start of the day or between each cycle irrigation was applied from 9 00 10 00 for control replicates with both treatments beginning at 10 00 and ending no later than 11 10 the sensor in the h paniculata replicate for each bed was used as the sole basis for oh and ss due to its water consumption and sensitivity to drought stress relative to the other three taxa irrigation treatments were randomly assigned to each bed for the bed that was left as a blank without plants 190 m3 ha 1 d 1 of overhead irrigation was applied to a bed without plants and not receiving pesticides in order to establish baseline data treatments initiated on 11 june 2018 and concluded on 11 october 2018 2 6 pesticide applications nine pesticides were applied over the duration of this study in three distinct monitoring periods each consisting of 16 days each monitoring period had an herbicide insecticide and a fungicide applied with herbicides applied first followed by the insecticide fungicide application as a tank mix table 1 pesticides were selected based on their physiochemical properties and commonality in nursery production and organized based on mccall s koc sorption coefficient for affinity to organic carbon class and fao mobility classifications into three groups table 2 pre emergent herbicide was applied first followed by watering in using overhead irrigation per label recommendation after surface irf from watering in ceased insecticides fungicides tank mix were applied therefore herbicides have an additional sample date all pesticides were applied as liquids according to ornamental crop label rate via wagon mounted sprayer connected by hose to a four nozzle boom measuring 1 52 m across with a 1 83 m spray width boom width allowed the 6 1 6 1 m area to be divided into thirds with passes starting at the low point and moving uphill west to east for the western block of raised beds vice verse for the eastern block herbicide applications required one pass over each third to achieve desired application rates while the tank mix required two passes prior to application events nozzles were calibrated to a minimum of 95 uniformity in spray output and applicator walking speed was calibrated to provide desired application rates the herbicides isoxaben oxyfluorfen and prodiamine were applied first in each respective monitoring period using a teejet model 8002 nozzle wheaton il usa via spray boom followed by watering in afterwards insecticide fungicide tank mix was applied using teejet model 8006 nozzles nozzles were tested prior to each spray event to ensure uniformity in spray output and applicator walking speed was calibrated to provide desired application rates teejet 8002 average flow per nozzle 1110 ml min 1 teejet 8006 average flow per nozzle 2165 ml min 1 both 80 angles applicator walking speed 3 93 km hr 1 the first application date was 11 june 2018 consisting of isoxaben acephate bifenthrin and mefenoxam following isoxaben application all beds received 190 m3 ha 1 of overhead irrigation to water in the herbicide during monitoring periods 2 and 3 the treatments received the minimum watering in volume while the control received its typical daily application volume this was done to assess the potential for more efficient irrigation practices to specifically reduce herbicide movement following watering in events the second application date was 9 july 2018 consisting of oxyfluorfen acephate chlorpyrifos and triflumizole following oxyfluorfen application the control received 190 m3 ha 1 of overhead irrigation while the treatments received the label minimum recommended watering in rate of 63 3 m3 ha 1 the third application date was 20 august 2018 consisting of prodiamine acephate and thiophanate methyl following prodiamine application the control received 190 m3 ha 1 of overhead irrigation and treatments received the label minimum watering in rate of 126 6 m3 ha 1 no other irrigation was applied following watering in events on the day of pesticide application 2 7 sampling protocol collection tanks were emptied 24 h prior to sampling to allow accumulation of subsurface irf over a full day and surface irf collection in response to an irrigation event samples were collected following herbicide application day 0 from surface irf tanks and from surface and subsurface irf tanks 1 2 4 8 and 16 days after application for each monitoring period water height in collection tanks was measured using a meter stick and converted to liters based on tank dimensions to quantify surface and subsurface irf volumes a sump pump with a hose attachment was inserted into the tank and ran for 10 s prior to sampling in order to clear the hose samples were collected in a 950 ml glass amber bottle qorpak glc02164 clinton pa samples were spiked with 75 μl of acetic acid was added for sample stabilization 2 8 pesticide chemical analysis water samples were analyzed at the organic contaminants analytical research laboratory in the soil and water sciences department university of florida gainesville fl using sample preparation extraction techniques and instrument conditions described in supplementary text 1 supplementary table 1 and supplementary table 2 2 9 experimental design and statistical analysis a completely randomized design was used for this study with irrigation treatment substrate treatment and plant placement for individual beds randomly assigned data was analyzed using sas v9 4 cary nc usa the volume of irrigation applied was evaluated using analysis of variance anova using the procglm procedure when irrigation treatment effects were significant p 0 05 means were separated using tukey s test in the lsmeans prompt the average number of days irrigation was applied was calculated as the average of the number of days each replicate within a treatment applied any irrigation at all assessment of average surface and subsurface irf volumes throughout the season used only sample days with 5 mm of precipitation surface and subsurface irf volume pesticide concentration and pesticide load were subject to anova using the procmixed procedure with repeated measures when treatment effects were significant p 0 05 means were separated using tukey s tests in the lsmeans prompt all variable means and standard errors were calculated using the procmeans feature regression models when f values were significant p 0 05 were used to model pesticide load over the 16 day period using the procglm procedure anova by date for surface and subsurface irf showed a substrate by irrigation interaction on 6 33 sample dates and main effect due to substrate type on 2 33 sample dates but main effect due to irrigation on 21 33 sample dates therefore only irrigation main effects are presented anova by date for pesticide load in irf showed a substrate by irrigation interaction on 7 110 sample dates and main effect due to substrate type on 3 110 sample dates but main effect due to irrigation for 39 110 sample dates therefore only irrigation main effects are presented all values are expressed on a per hectare basis 3 results and discussion 3 1 water applied and irf irrigating using θ reduced water use across all three monitoring periods compared to the control oh reduced water applied by 42 63 and ss reduced water applied compared to the control by 73 81 over the three monitoring periods during the second and third monitoring periods ss reduced water use compared to oh by 54 67 the reduced volume of irrigation applied in the treatments often reduced the volume of surface irf compared to the control especially when irrigating using ss warsaw et al 2009 investigated using θ based irrigation practices in container nursery production and the effects it had on irf volume our results were consistent with their findings where irrigating based on θ reduced water use up to 44 while also reducing irf by between 66 and 79 they posited that the reduction in irf was twofold resulting from both the reduced volume of irrigation applied as well as more substrate capacity to absorb water due to likely lower substrate θ pre irrigation mathers et al 2005 also suggested that using micro irrigation and or cyclic irrigation can reduce water use as well as runoff for both treatments if the target θ was already met irrigation would not be applied and thus eliminating any surface return flow ss drastically reduced surface irf as the intermittent application cycles leaching and matric movement through substrates and lower application volumes often times resulted in no surface irf being generated in general surface return flow in ss irrigated beds was almost entirely precipitation induced subsurface irf for all treatments was similarly responsive to precipitation events with greater volumes of subsurface irf produced in the aftermath of a rain event 3 1 1 monitoring period 1 a total of 2734 m3 of irrigation was applied to the control which was greater than oh 1025 m3 and ss 531 m3 the control consistently applied more daily irrigation than both treatments fig 1a the control applied irrigation on all 16 dates which was greater than the average number of days irrigation was applied for oh 10 33 and ss 11 5 the total volume of surface irf between day 1 and 16 was 70 lower for oh and 95 lower for ss compared to the control surface irf volume collected in the first monitoring period was consistently greater in the control than both treatments on each sample date fig 1b the control and both treatments consistently generated subsurface irf fig 1c oh subsurface return flow volumes over the first two days were markedly higher than the control or ss this is likely attributed to oh producing less surface irf via reduced application volumes and delays between cycles and that the applied water had time to infiltrate and percolate through the fabric and sand profile 3 1 2 monitoring period 2 a total of 2852 m3 was applied to the control 1601 m3 to oh and 529 m3 to ss across all measured dates the control applied a greater volume of irrigation than ss fig 2a oh applied less irrigation than the control on 5 of 8 measurement dates following day 0 while also applying more than the ss on 3 sample dates the control applied irrigation on all 16 dates which was greater than oh 11 6 and ss 9 5 throughout monitoring period 2 oh and ss reduced the total volume of surface irf compared to the control by 70 and 95 the control consistently generated greater volumes of surface irf than both treatments throughout monitoring period 2 fig 2b subsurface irf was typically statistically equivalent between the control and all treatments however similarly to monitoring period 1 oh generated greater volumes of subsurface irf than the control or ss fig 2c 3 1 3 monitoring period 3 a total of 2062 m3 was applied to the control which was greater than oh 1120 m3 and ss 550 m3 irrigation was not applied to the control or treatments on day 1 or 8 due to precipitation the control applied a greater volume of irrigation than ss on all days however oh irrigation volumes were occasionally equivalent to the control fig 3a the control was irrigated on 14 dates whereas oh applied irrigation on 9 33 days and ss on 10 5 days throughout monitoring period 3 total surface irf volumes were reduced by 66 and 84 using oh and ss compared to the control greater volumes of surface irf were consistently generated in the control vs both treatments on all sample dates fig 3b subsurface irf volumes generated by oh were typically greater than the control and ss particularly over the first four sample dates of monitoring period 3 fig 3c 3 2 pesticide dynamics 3 2 1 acephate across the three monitoring periods nearly 2 3 times more acephate was recovered in surface irrigation return flow from the control than oh ss typically reduced eliminated surface irf generation with total acephate recovered in surface irf approximately 4 1000 times lower than the control the amount of acephate recovered in surface irf represented a substantial portion of the amount applied with 83 107 of the 553 g recovered in the control 24 54 in oh and 1 22 in ss across all three rounds table 3 conversely to the total load recovered in surface irf oh exported 2 3 times more acephate than the control in subsurface irf over the three monitoring periods ss exported a similar total load of acephate in subsurface irf as the control during round 2 but nearly twice as much for round 1 and 3 roughly 3 28 of applied acephate was recovered in subsurface irf from the control 14 50 for oh and 7 53 in ss demonstrating how subsurface irf is a critical vector in the movement of acephate regardless of irrigation practice for the control total acephate recovery was 3 5 27 times greater in surface irf than subsurface irf however for oh total acephate recovery in surface irf was typically equivalent to subsurface irf load recovered during the second and third monitoring period but approximately 3 2 times greater during the first monitoring period considering that ss reduced and often eliminated surface irf subsurface irf was the predominant pathway of loss for acephate nearly 2 3 times as much acephate was recovered in subsurface irf than surface irf from ss during the second and third monitoring period while in monitoring period one it was approximately 75 times greater 3 2 1 1 acephate monitoring period 1 the control exported a total of 591 g of acephate in surface irf table 3 the total load recovered in surface irf from oh and ss was 256 g and 0 51 g or 46 and 1 of applied acephate acephate load recovered in surface irf was consistently greater in the control than either treatment on any day throughout the monitoring period fig 1d both the control and oh exhibited a linear decrease in surface irf acephate load when both axes were transformed supplementary table 3 the highest acephate concentrations were measured in surface irf for the control and oh on the first two days following applications day 1 control 4420 µg l 1 oh 2590 µg l 1 day 2 control 1010 µg l 1 oh 630 µg l 1 supplementary table 4 subsurface irf samples over the 5 sample dates yielded 22 g 79 g and 39 g in the control oh and ss respectively corresponding to 4 14 and 7 of applied acephate table 3 acephate load recovered in subsurface irf was typically equivalent with the exception of day 2 where oh exhibited a spike in both load fig 1e and concentration supplementary table 4 ss exhibited a quadratic relationship when both axes were transformed supplementary table 3 suggesting a lag effect occurred in acephate movement through the sand profile of ss beds subsurface irf concentrations of acephate were typically equivalent however oh had a peak concentration of 1168 µg l 1 on day 2 and ss had a peak concentration of 1327 µg l 1 on day 4 supplementary table 4 combining total surface and subsurface acephate load 613 g 335 g and 39 2 g were recovered in the control oh and ss respectively corresponding to 110 61 and 7 of applied acephate table 3 3 2 1 2 acephate monitoring period 2 total acephate load recovered in surface irf was 461 g 134 g and 26 0 g in the control oh and ss respectively corresponding to 83 24 and 5 of applied acephate table 3 the load of acephate recovered in surface irf from the control was often equivalent to oh following day 1 fig 2d oh exhibited a linear decrease in surface irf load when both axes were transformed supplementary table 3 the concentration of acephate in surface irf was nearly 3000 µg l 1 for the control on day 1 while concentrations exceeded 1000 µg l 1 for oh on days 1 2 and 4 supplementary table 4 total subsurface irf acephate recovered was 54 1 g 125 g and 60 8 g for the control oh and ss respectively representing 10 23 and 11 of applied acephate table 3 there were no differences between the control or treatments in subsurface acephate load on day 8 and 16 however both treatments had exhibited spikes on day 1 and 4 fig 2e the control and both treatments exhibited a linear decrease in subsurface irf acephate load when transforming both axes supplementary table 3 peak concentrations of acephate in subsurface irf occurred on day 2 for the control 3820 µg l 1 and day 1 for oh 1330 µg l 1 and ss 1000 µg l 1 supplementary table 4 total load recovered in combined surface and subsurface irf yielded 515 g 259 g and 86 8 g in the control oh and ss respectively corresponding to 93 47 and 16 of applied acephate table 3 3 2 1 3 acephate monitoring period 3 total acephate load recovered in surface irf was 541 g 297 g and 124 g in the control oh and ss respectively corresponding to 98 54 and 22 of applied acephate table 3 irrigation was not applied to the control or either treatment on day 1 or 8 due to precipitation therefore ss surface irf volumes and total acephate movement 22 of applied g ha 1 were substantially greater than monitoring periods 1 1 and 2 5 acephate loads recovered in surface irf were typically greater from the control than either treatment fig 3d the control and oh exhibited a linear decrease in surface irf load of acephate when both axes were transformed supplementary table 3 acephate concentration in surface return flow peaked on day 1 which was precipitation induced for both the control 3120 µg l 1 and ss 1980 µg l 1 whereas peak surface return flow concentrations occurred on day 2 for oh 3130 µg l 1 supplementary table 4 total acephate recovered in subsurface irf yielded 157 g 276 g and 295 g for the control oh and ss respectively representing 28 50 and 53 of applied acephate table 3 subsurface acephate loads were greatest on day 1 for the control and ss and day 2 for oh fig 3e oh exhibited a quadratic relationship increasing before decreasing and ss exhibited a linear decrease in subsurface irf acephate load when both axes were transformed suggesting a lag effect from day 1 to day 2 for oh and rapid movement for ss on day 1 supplementary table 3 subsurface concentrations peaked on day 1 for the control 3740 µg l 1 and ss 6120 µg l 1 while oh peaked on day 2 8250 µg l 1 supplementary table 4 total combined irf acephate load recovered was 697 g 574 g and 419 g ha 1 in the control oh and ss respectively corresponding to 126 104 and 76 of applied acephate table 3 acephate solubility is over 31 times greater than the next most soluble pesticide mefenoxam and 818 million times greater than the least soluble pesticide bifenthrin therefore it was hypothesized that acephate would be the most mobile of all investigated pesticides the mobility of acephate in water has been reported by sun et al 2018 where in assessing pesticide concentrations in the yangtze river acephate was present in higher concentrations than any other pesticide investigated over all three monitoring periods acephate was recovered in both greatest quantity and percentage of amount applied of all pesticides used in this study in both surface and subsurface irf table 3 similarly acephate was the pesticide with the highest concentration in both surface and subsurface irf acephate is unlikely to undergo photodegradation or volatilization ncbi 2020 however aerobic degradation is a prominent degradation mechanism where ramu and seetharaman 2014 reported that the bacterial strain pseudomonas aeruginosa strain is 6 was capable of degrading acephate and a number of other organophosphorus pesticides with efficacy maintained at concentrations as high as 1 g l 1 through irrigating to reduce both surface and subsurface irf degradative processes may occur in situ before precipitation or irrigation induced irf can move acephate 3 2 2 mefenoxam the amount of applied mefenoxam recovered was second only to acephate for both surface and subsurface irf demonstrating its capacity to move through both surface and subsurface profiles total amount of mefenoxam recovered in surface irf from the control was nearly 20 times greater than subsurface irf and for oh nearly twice as much mefenoxam was recovered in surface versus subsurface irf considering ss reduced or eliminated surface irf thus resulting in subsurface irf as the prominent vector for movement approximately 22 times more mefenoxam was recovered in subsurface irf versus surface irf nearly twice as much mefenoxam was recovered in surface irf from the control 1 68 g than oh 0 95 g while the total load of mefenoxam recovered from ss 0 02 g was approximately 120 times lower than the control representing 9 5 and 1 of applied mefenoxam respectively the load of mefenoxam recovered in surface irf was typically greater in the control versus both treatments fig 1 f a linear decrease was observed in the surface irf load of both the control and oh when both axes were transformed supplementary table 3 mefenoxam concentrations in surface irf peaked on day 1 for the control and oh at 9 98 and 8 22 µg l 1 however as ss often eliminated surface irf concentrations never exceeded 1 µg l 1 supplementary table 4 mefenoxam total load recovered in subsurface irf was 0 5 g in oh which was approximately 4 5 times greater than the control 0 086 g and nearly 1 5 times greater than ss 0 31 g the amount of the applied 18 2 g recovered in subsurface irf was 1 in the control and roughly 3 and 2 for the oh and ss mefenoxam load recovered in subsurface irf exhibited peaks on day 2 for oh and day 4 for ss fig 1g a quadratic equation was significant for ss when both axes were transformed supplementary table 3 mefenoxam load recovered in subsurface irf from ss peaked on day 4 suggesting a lag effect occurred the concentration of mefenoxam in subsurface irf for the control and oh peaked on day 2 at 2 73 and 8 32 µg l 1 ss peaked on day 4 at 11 39 µg l 1 supplementary table 4 the total load of mefenoxam recovered over the monitoring period in combined irf was 1 77 g 1 45 g and 0 33 g for the control oh and ss respectively corresponding to 9 7 7 9 and 1 8 of applied mefenoxam table 3 mefenoxam was hypothesized to be present in surface and subsurface irf based on solubility and low koc and was not expected to volatilize table 2 the mobility of mefenoxam was investigated by gardner and branham 2001 where turf or barren soil plots received either static 10 mm 5 times per week or estimated evapotranspiration based irrigation regardless of the irrigation practice mefenoxam rapidly infiltrated through soil profiles in their study the quadratic model for mefenoxam movement in subsurface irf from ss in our study suggested a lag effect occurred where the reduced volume and non target application of irrigation applied relative to overhead delivery methods delayed mefenoxam movement through subsurface profiles mefenoxam is unlikely to undergo photolysis or hydrolysis triantafyllidis et al 2012 however microbial degradation has been considered the primary pathway of degradation gardner and branham 2001 monkiedje and spiteller 2005 the results suggest that rapid movement of mefenoxam in surface irf is likely to occur shortly after applying this compound and that reduced irrigation volumes and or applying irrigation with more precision can delay its movement in subsurface irf 3 2 3 bifenthrin the control exported 0 32 g of bifenthrin in surface irf roughly 2 5 times more than oh 0 126 g and 110 times more than ss 0 00284 g however this amount represented under 0 1 of applied bifenthrin in all cases table 3 bifenthrin was almost always below the limit of detection 0 125 µg l 1 in subsurface irf samples yielding total amounts recovered of 0 02 g across the control and both treatments this corresponded to 0 01 of applied bifenthrin results demonstrate that surface irf is a more likely vector in bifenthrin movement than subsurface irf bifenthrin load recovered in surface irf from the control was consistently greater than both treatments on each day fig 1h the control and oh exhibited a linear decrease in bifenthrin load exported over time via surface irf when both axes were transformed supplementary table 3 with the exception of day 1 where the control and oh exported concentrations of 1 9 µg l 1 and 1 41 µg l 1 all concentrations were below 0 7 µg l 1 in surface irf supplementary table 4 total bifenthrin load recovered in subsurface irf was 16 7 mg 12 8 mg and 8 44 mg in the control oh and ss respectively table 3 the concentration of bifenthrin in subsurface irf was typically below the limit of detection and never exceeded 0 23 µg l 1 on any date for the control and treatments supplementary table 4 therefore subsurface irf load calculations are a reflection of the volume of irf fig 1i combining total surface and subsurface irf bifenthrin load the control oh and ss exported 336 139 and 11 3 mg respectively of the 130 g applied 0 3 was recovered across the control and treatments in the total irf table 3 bifenthrin was hypothesized to move predominantly in surface return flow via erosive detachment of sediments particles and to exhibit minimal movement in subsurface return flow considering its low solubility table 2 while the low solubility of bifenthrin suggests volatilization from moist soils or surface water may occur the strong sorptive tendencies of bifenthrin may limit this pathway of degradation ncbi 2020 despite bifenthrin being considered a fairly immobile compound potential risk to water bodies may occur based on persistence in the environment and wide use sardiña et al 2019 and bioactivity at low concentrations for aquatic life bertotto et al 2019 brander et al 2016 bifenthrin is considered unlikely to photodegrade jin et al 2009 however microbial degradation by species such as pseudomonas sp cb2 and stenotrophomonas acidaminiphila have been reported lee et al 2004 zhang et al 2018 weston et al 2009 reported concentrations of 0 073 µg l 1 and 1 2 µg g 1 of bifenthrin in water and suspended sediments collected from a californian urban creek this was similar to the peak concentrations of bifenthrin in surface irf in our study control 1 9 µg l 1 oh 1 41 µg l 1 both measured the day following application however all subsequent sample dates were below 1 µg l 1 concentrations of bifenthrin in subsurface irf were nearly universally below the limit of detection and never exceeded 0 25 µg l 1 the results demonstrate that subsurface movement is unlikely to occur with bifenthrin however potential for sorbed bifenthrin to be erosively detached and transported in surface irf represents the primary vector of movement particularly in the days immediately after pesticide application therefore reducing surface irf through lower irrigation volumes oh and precision application of water ss can reduce or nearly eliminate the movement of bifenthrin 3 2 4 isoxaben across the total sample dates where isoxaben loads were collected from surface irf watering in event and days 1 2 4 8 and 16 86 4 g were recovered from the control which was nearly twice as much as oh 44 3 g and 4 times greater than ss 19 1 g table 3 this corresponded to 10 5 and 2 of applied isoxaben recovered via this vector for the control oh and ss respectively total subsurface isoxaben recovered in oh 6 07 g was nearly 4 times greater than the control 1 41 g and nearly 3 times greater than ss 2 34 g in all cases representing 0 1 of applied isoxaben comparing the amount of isoxaben recovered in surface irf versus subsurface irf nearly 61 7 3 and 8 2 times more isoxaben was recovered in the control oh and ss respectively demonstrating that surface irf is a more likely vector in isoxaben movement than subsurface irf isoxaben load recovered in surface irf was typically greater in the control than either treatment fig 1j isoxaben load in surface irf exhibited a linear decrease when both axes were transformed for the control and oh supplementary table 3 surface irf concentrations were greatest on the watering in event and day 1 where the control and both treatments had peak concentrations exceeding 340 µg l 1 supplementary table 4 isoxaben load recovered in subsurface irf was typically equivalent on every sample date however oh reached a noticeable peak on day 2 compared to the control and ss fig 1k a linear decrease was identified in subsurface irf for the control when both axes were transformed while ss exhibited an increasing then decreasing quadratic relationship supplementary table 3 indicating a lag effect occurred isoxaben concentrations in subsurface irf peaked on day 1 for the control 111 µg l 1 and ss 117 µg l 1 and day 2 for oh 99 4 µg l 1 supplementary table 4 combining surface and subsurface irf the control oh and ss exported a total of 87 8 g 50 4 g and 21 5 g respectively corresponding to 10 6 and 2 of the 867 g applied table 3 isoxaben is considered moderately soluble based on a solubility of 1 42 mg l 1 but is only slightly mobile based on its koc which suggests it is most likely to adsorb to sediments or other materials but may exhibit some mobility in water table 2 volatilization is not expected to be a major pathway of degradation from either dry or moist soils nor is it considered likely to hydrolyze based on the composition of its functional group however photodegradation may occur with isoxaben ncbi 2020 bacterial degradation particularly in aerobic and moist soils has been reported to be a prominent pathway in the dissipation of isoxaben camper et al 2001 walker 1987 isoxaben movement in nursery irf was reported to be greatest on the days immediately following application briggs et al 1998 but declined with each subsequent irrigation event following the day of application in our study the majority of isoxaben was transported in surface irf on the day of application and first two days following application representing 96 97 and 89 of the total amount recovered for the control oh and ss respectively isoxaben exhibited some mobility in subsurface irf however surface irf is the predominant vector and irrigating as conservatively as possible immediately following isoxaben application can effectively reduce the movement of this compound 3 2 5 triflumizole across the total 5 sample dates 5 99 g of triflumizole was recovered in surface irf from the control nearly 4 times greater than oh 1 66 g and 45 times greater than ss 0 13 g corresponding to recovering approximately 2 of the applied triflumizole from the control 1 for oh and 0 1 for ss approximately twice as much triflumizole was recovered in subsurface irf from oh 0 2 g vs the control 0 1 g and three times as much as ss 0 08 g however this amounted to 0 2 g total recovery for the control and each treatment or 0 1 of the triflumizole applied table 3 comparing the amount of triflumizole recovered in surface irf versus subsurface irf nearly 58 8 4 and 1 7 times more triflumizole was recovered in the control oh and ss respectively demonstrating that surface irf is a more likely vector in triflumizole movement than subsurface irf triflumizole was generally recovered in greater amounts of surface irf from the control on each sample date particularly early on however the difference was typically only noticeable compared to ss fig 2f the control exhibited a linear decrease in surface irf triflumizole load when both axes were transformed supplementary table 3 surface concentrations for the control peaked at 38 3 µg l 1 on day 1 for oh at 15 86 µg l 1 on day 2 and ss at 4 07 µg l 1 on day 4 supplementary table 4 triflumizole load recovered in subsurface irf was similar between the control and both treatments on all sample dates with all of them peaking on day 4 fig 2g subsurface concentrations for the control peaked at 5 65 µg l 1 on day 4 for oh at 2 57 µg l 1 on day 8 and ss at 1 17 µg l 1 on day 1 supplementary table 4 total triflumizole load recovered in combined surface and subsurface irf yielded 6 09 g 1 85 g and 0 21 g in the control oh and ss respectively corresponding to 2 1 1 and 0 1 of applied triflumizole table 3 triflumizole is considered to be readily soluble at 10 mg l 1 however it is considered to have low to slight mobility based on a koc of 1400 nor is it expected to volatilize table 2 triflumizole is widely used in numerous agricultural sectors therefore increasing the risk of surface water contamination where it has been reported to be detrimental towards freshwater algal species such as chlorella vulgaris xi et al 2019 the results demonstrate that minimizing surface irf particularly after triflumizole application is the most effective way to limit the movement of this compound 3 2 6 chlorpyrifos across the total 5 sample dates 4 54 g of chlorpyrifos was recovered in surface irf from the control nearly 5 5 times greater than oh 0 84 g and over 100 times greater than the ss 0 04 g considering ss typically reduced or eliminated surface irf generation table 3 in all cases this amounted to 0 1 of the applied chlorpyrifos recovered in surface irf less than 0 06 g of chlorpyrifos was recovered in subsurface irf for the control and either treatment representing 0 0001 of applied chlorpyrifos comparing the amount of chlorpyrifos recovered in surface irf versus subsurface irf nearly 179 14 2 and 1 2 times more chlorpyrifos was recovered in the control oh and ss respectively demonstrating that surface irf is a more likely vector in chlorpyrifos movement than subsurface irf chlorpyrifos load was typically greater in the control than both treatments on day 1 and 2 however were similar on day 4 and beyond fig 2h chlorpyrifos load in surface irf water from the control exhibited a linear decrease when both axes were transformed supplementary table 3 chlorpyrifos concentrations in surface irf peaked for the control and oh on day 1 at 33 89 µg l 1 and 15 65 µg l 1 ss often eliminated surface irf and the peak concentration was 1 27 µg l 1 on day 4 supplementary table 4 subsurface irf chlorpyrifos loads were typically equivalent on each date fig 2i a quadratic decrease between chlorpyrifos load recovered in subsurface irf and days after application was identified in both oh and ss when transforming both axes whereas no significant relationship was identified in the control supplementary table 3 chlorpyrifos load recovered in subsurface irf from ss increased from day 2 to day 4 followed by decreasing from day 4 to day 8 suggesting a lag effect occurred total chlorpyrifos load recovered in subsurface irf was 0 03 g 0 06 g and 0 04 g in the control oh and ss respectively corresponding to 1 of applied chlorpyrifos table 3 subsurface irf concentrations of chlorpyrifos never exceeded 1 µg l 1 supplementary table 4 the total combined irf chlorpyrifos load was 4 56 g 0 89 g and 0 08 g for the control oh and ss respectively accounting for 1 of applied chlorpyrifos table 3 chlorpyrifos is considered moderately soluble however based on a koc range of 995 31 000 may be considered moderately mobile immobile table 2 the lack of subsurface movement exhibited by chlorpyrifos was consistent with milhome et al 2015 findings of chlorpyrifos below detection in groundwater samples where in our study concentrations in subsurface irf never exceed 1 µg l 1 chlorpyrifos is likely to degrade via volatilization photolysis and or microbial degradation ncbi 2020 reducing surface irf through improved irrigation practices can maintain chlorpyrifos on production surfaces and allow these degradation practices to occur 3 2 7 oxyfluorfen nearly 3 times as much oxyfluorfen was recovered in surface irf from the control 0 22 g than oh 0 08 g and 11 more than ss 0 02 g this corresponded to recovering approximately 0 0001 of the applied oxyfluorfen from the control and far less for either treatment approximately 3 times as much oxyfluorfen was recovered in subsurface irf from oh vs the control and 2 times as much from oh vs the ss however this amounted to 0 05 g total recovery for the control and each treatment or 0 0001 of the oxyfluorfen applied comparing the amount of oxyfluorfen recovered in surface versus subsurface irf nearly 15 and 1 5 times more oxyfluorfen was recovered in the control and oh however ss had nearly 1 6 times more oxyfluorfen recovered in subsurface than surface irf results demonstrate that surface irf is a more likely vector in oxyfluorfen movement than subsurface irf oxyfluorfen loads in surface irf were typically greater than either treatment on each sample date fig 2j oxyfluorfen concentrations in surface irf universally averaged below 1 µg l 1 supplementary table 4 in total collected subsurface irf the control oh and ss recovered 0 02 g 0 05 g and 0 03 g respectively in all cases accounting for 0 01 of applied oxyfluorfen table 3 the load of oxyfluorfen recovered in subsurface irf was generally equivalent on each sample date fig 2k a linear decrease in oxyfluorfen load was observed in ss subsurface irf when transforming both axes supplementary table 3 an increase in ss subsurface irf load was observed from day 2 to day 4 suggesting the potential for a lag effect to occur oxyfluorfen concentration in subsurface irf across the control and treatments was universally below 1 µg l 1 across all dates supplementary table 4 in total combined oxyfluorfen irf samples 0 24 g 0 13 g and 0 05 g were recovered in the control oh and ss respectively universally corresponding to 1 of applied oxyfluorfen table 3 oxyfluorfen is considered slightly soluble 0 12 mg l 1 and based on a koc of 8900 is considered slightly mobile to immobile table 2 oxyfluorfen is not expected to volatilize based on henry s law constant 8 2 10 7 atm m3 mol 1 however microbial degradation is considered a prominent degradation mechanism ncbi 2020 the low concentrations of oxyfluorfen detected in surface and subsurface irf universally below 1 µg l 1 as well as the lack of mobility in subsurface profiles are consistent with riley et al 1994 finding of oxyfluorfen samples being below the level of solubility and alister et al 2009 finding that over 74 of oxyfluorfen was found in the top 2 5 cm of soil after 90 and 340 days following application in a vineyard system oxyfluorfen dissipation in soils was investigated by wu et al 2019 where they found that higher ph and organic matter content could increase degradation rate while soils with larger clay fractions reduced the degradation rate in response to less pore space for oxyfluorfen spread considering that this study used sand for its soil profile this may have enhanced degradation as there was no organic matter or clay and greater pore space 3 2 8 thiophanate methyl total load of thiophanate methyl recovered in surface irf from the control 42 8 g was 4 times greater than oh 10 8 g and 6 times greater than ss 7 36 g of the 482 g of thiophanate methyl applied roughly 9 was recovered in surface irf from the control while oh and ss led to total recovery of 2 2 and 1 5 thiophanate methyl total load recovered in subsurface irf was approximately 3 g in the control 2 g for oh and 2 75 g for ss however in all cases it accounted for 1 of the thiophanate methyl applied comparing amount of thiophanate methyl recovered in surface irf versus subsurface irf nearly 14 5 5 and 2 7 times more thiophanate methyl was recovered in the control oh and ss respectively demonstrating that surface irf is a more likely vector in thiophanate methyl movement than subsurface irf a greater load of thiophanate methyl was typically recovered in surface irf samples from the control than either treatment particularly on early sample dates fig 3f a linear decrease was identified surface irf thiophanate methyl load for the control and oh when both axes were transformed supplementary table 3 the concentration of thiophanate methyl in surface irf were highest on day 1 with peak concentrations of 341 7 µg l 1 for the control and 130 8 µg l 1 and 134 0 µg l 1 in oh and ss supplementary table 4 the load of thiophanate methyl recovered in subsurface irf was generally equivalent between the control and both treatments on all sample dates with a daily load for the control or either treatment never exceeding 3 g ha 1 fig 3g a linear decrease in subsurface irf thiophanate methyl load was identified in oh and ss when both axes were transformed supplementary table 3 subsurface thiophanate methyl concentrations peaked on day 1 for the control 71 2 µg l 1 and ss 70 7 µg l 1 and on day 2 for oh 66 1 µg l 1 supplementary table 4 total combined irf thiophanate methyl loads yielded 45 8 g 12 8 g and 10 1 g in the control oh and ss respectively corresponding to 9 5 2 7 and 2 1 of applied thiophanate methyl table 3 with a solubility of 26 6 mg l 1 and a koc of 330 thiophanate methyl is classified as moderately mobile readily soluble table 2 and may be readily mobile in irf or precipitation events shortly after application briggs et al 1998 photolysis and volatilization are unlikely pathways of degradation for thiophanate methyl however microbial degradation is considered a likely pathway briggs et al 2002 cycon et al 2011 thiophanate methyl in movement in irf from container nurseries has been reported to be greatest shortly following application where briggs et al 2002 reported that 3 5 7 of applied thiophanate methyl was recovered in the first irrigation event post application in the third monitoring period of our study no irrigation was applied the first day following application due to precipitation however the surface return flow generated from that precipitation event transported a similar percentage of applied thiophanate methyl control 7 2 oh 1 8 ss 1 5 as briggs et al 2002 observed concentrations of thiophanate methyl were greatest in both surface and subsurface irf the first two days following application supplementary table 4 but by day 8 were universally below 1 µg l 1 in both surface and subsurface irf the results demonstrate thiophanate methyl rapidly moves in both surface and subsurface vectors and minimizing irf shortly after this compound is applied can reduce the movement of this compound 3 2 9 prodiamine a total of 21 1 g of prodiamine were recovered in surface irf from the control nearly 10 times greater than oh 2 28 g and ss 2 69 g corresponding to approximately 1 of the applied prodiamine from the control and 0 1 either treatment in subsurface irf 0 15 g were recovered for the control and treatments representing 0 0001 of all applied prodiamine comparing prodiamine recovery in surface irf versus subsurface irf nearly 141 23 2 and 19 6 times more prodiamine was recovered in the control oh and ss respectively results demonstrate surface irf is a more likely vector in prodiamine movement than subsurface irf surface irf prodiamine loads were greater in the control than both treatments on all sample dates fig 3h a decreasing linear equation in surface irf prodiamine load was identified for the control and oh when both axes were transformed supplementary table 3 prodiamine concentrations were greatest over the day of application post watering in and the day after application peaking at 102 61 µg l 1 37 02 µg l 1 and 40 81 µg l 1 in the control oh and ss respectively supplementary table 4 prodiamine load in subsurface irf was equivalent on all sample dates and never exceeded 0 1 g ha 1 on a given sample date fig 3i subsurface irf prodiamine load from ss exhibited a quadratic increase then decrease when both axes were log transformed supplementary table 3 the total load recovered in subsurface irf was 0 15 g 0 1 g and 0 14 g for the control oh and ss respectively in all cases below 0 1 of applied prodiamine table 3 prodiamine concentrations in subsurface irf were universally below 8 µg l 1 supplementary table 4 the total load of prodiamine in combined irf was 21 3 g 2 37 g and 2 82 g in the control oh and ss respectively corresponding to 1 3 of applied prodiamine in the control and 1 in either treatment table 3 prodiamine is considered insoluble 0 13 mg l 1 and relatively immobile based on koc ranges of 5440 16 200 table 2 photolysis and microbial degradation are considered to be primary routes of dissipation stearman et al 2012 herbicides within the dinitroaniline class typically are characterized by high molecular weight predilection for hydrophobic sorption and lower mobility compared with other classes however volatilization can occur particularly in moist soils weber 1990 stearman et al 2012 investigated prodiamine removal from nursery irf using subsurface constructed wetlands where prodiamine concentrations from nursery irf of 500 3200 µg l 1 were reduced by 48 65 attributed to biodegradation and sorptive processes concentrations in our study peaked on the watering in event following application for the control 102 6 µg l 1 oh 37 µg l 1 and ss 40 8 µg l 1 however this was still substantially lower than stearman et al 2012 reducing irf and maintaining prodiamine on the production surface may allow more degradation processes to occur particularly photolysis 3 3 ecological toxicity pesticides and degradation products of pesticides such as methadimophos from acephate a potent acetylcholinesterase inhibitor in its own right may be ecologically deleterious if present in bioactive levels in water yen et al 2000 daphnia magna water flea and oncorhynchus mykiss rainbow trout are used as indicator species to evaluate the negative impacts that pesticide residues may have on aquatic ecosystems in relation to the lethal concentration that kills 50 of a test population lc50 or the concentration required to elicit 50 of the maximal biological response ec50 supplementary table 5 in assessing both of these indicator species the only pesticides exceeding either of these thresholds were bifenthrin daphnia magna 0 11 µg l 1 oncorhynchus mykiss 0 26 µg l 1 and chlorpyrifos daphnia magna 0 1 µg l 1 oncorhynchus mykiss 25 µg l 1 where the average concentrations occurring in surface irf in the days shortly following application were 1 9 and 33 9 µg l 1 however it should be noted that this study represents a worst case scenario in pesticide movement considering that samples were collected immediately after leaving each replicate bed therefore this serves as an indicator of relative risk to aquatic organisms between compounds investigated in this study with the remaining 7 9 pesticide concentrations varying in order of magnitudes below the eco toxicological thresholds in practice irf would likely be directed through several irf channels ditches prior to either on site collection or off site release as pesticide residues move in irf through such channels the potential for other degradative processes may further reduce concentration of these compounds while sedimentation of suspended solids bearing sorbed pesticides may limit movement majsztrik et al 2017 4 conclusions irrigating based on θ reduced the volume of water applied as well as the volume of irf for the oh reductions in the volume of water applied reduced the amount of irrigation to non target areas contributing to less irf the direct application of water to containers via ss allowed more precise irrigation applications eliminating non target access and oftentimes resulting in complete elimination of surface irf no differences were identified in subsurface irf volumes between the treatments and the control however the consistently greater volumes of surface irf from the control indicates that more efficient irrigation practices have a greater impact on surface return volume than subsurface irf volume pesticide mobility in surface and subsurface irf was reflective of each compounds physiochemical properties with more soluble pesticides capable of moving in both surface and subsurface irf while less soluble pesticides were typically only mobile in surface irf for all pesticides studied surface irf typically exported a greater amount of each pesticide a linear decrease in surface irf loads exported from the control was identified for all pesticides except oxyfluorfen thus indicating that reductions in surface irf volumes generated in the days immediately following pesticide applications reduce overall movement of pesticides through reducing pesticide movement compounds may degrade in situ irrigating via overhead using θ reduces water use and irf when compared to standard overhead irrigation practices whereas ss irrigation applies water directly to containers and often eliminates surface irf in general typically irrigating using ss will not generate surface irf only precipitation will furthermore the avoidance of applying irrigation to inter container spaces may maintain pesticides on the production surface where photolysis and volatilization rates may increase it was observed that a greater amount of applied pesticides were lost to irf from the high mobility group than the moderately and low mobility groups table 3 practical strategies to minimize pesticide movement is selecting pesticides possessing low solubilities high adsorption coefficients when possible however consideration should be given towards the potential eco toxicological risk of each compound as well regardless of pesticide physiochemical properties implementing irrigation practices that delay irrigation applications reduce irrigation volume and or provide water directly to crops containers are management practices that effectively limit pesticide movement particularly highly mobile compounds declaration of competing interest the

9954,this study investigated the transport of 9 pesticides in surface and subsurface irrigation return flow from a container plant production system over 3 16 day monitoring periods pesticides were applied 3 times during the year and the pesticides were selected to provide a range of physiochemical properties pesticides are most commonly transported in water and irrigation return flow is a driving factor therefore irrigation methods were investigated to determine effects on irrigation return flow volume and transport of pesticides a control overhead irrigation and two treatments irrigating based on substrate volumetric moisture content θ were used pesticide transport in irrigation return flow was related to days after application physiochemical properties and irrigation method additionally pesticide transport was disproportionately reduced in respect to physiochemical properties in subsurface irrigation return flow in response to irrigation methods θ based irrigation treatments reduced irrigation volume applied by 49 and 77 compared to the control leading to a reduction in the volume of surface irrigation return flow by 71 and 92 the θ based treatments reduced the total surface and subsurface volume of irrigation return flow by 52 and 78 versus the control in most cases pesticides movement in surface irrigation return flow exhibited a linear or quadratic decrease for the control while pesticide movement via subsurface irrigation return flow was related more to physiochemical properties limiting mobility rather than irrigation return flow volume or irrigation practice this study demonstrates pesticide movement in irrigation return flow can be substantially reduced by selecting pesticides with low solubility high adsorption coefficients whenever possible and reducing the volume application of irrigation to non target areas graphical abstract pesticide movement in surface and subsurface irrigation return flow irf reflect the physiochemical properties of each compound surface irf is capable of transporting both soluble and insoluble pesticides whereas insoluble pesticides which typically possess greater sorption coefficients are unlikely to infiltrate through subsurface profiles irrigating container plants based on substrate moisture content and or using micro irrigation systems like spray stakes reduces water use irf and pesticide movement compared to common overhead practices ga1 abbreviations oh overhead irrigation treatment ss spray stake irrigation treatment θ substrate volumetric water content keywords runoff pesticide mobility water quality water security water management 1 introduction off site transport of potentially harmful agrichemicals by irrigation return flow irf or reintroduction in recycled water is of increasing concern in regards to water security irf is the volume of irrigation water applied that is subsequently lost to surface runoff or subsurface infiltration this irf water may or may not be contained on site allowing it to contribute to non point source pollution particularly input intensive forms of agriculture such as container crop production may result in greater risk without proper management pesticides are critical to maintaining pest free aesthetically appealing crops with herbicides insecticides and fungicides typically applied multiple times per year the frequent oftentimes daily irrigation common in container crop production is likely to result in pesticides being transported off site in irf both surface and subsurface pesticide degradation encompasses a range of processes including photolysis microbial metabolization and volatilization however pesticides may exhibit high degrees of mobility in container crop production as water is the primary transporter of agrochemicals and be transported before degradation occurs abdi and fernandez 2019 vryzas 2018 pesticides represent a critical component in modern agriculture however their widespread use across numerous agricultural sectors increase risk of export to water bodies martins et al 2020 nie et al 2020 within the ornamental crop industry over 350 modes of action spanning several pesticide and chemical classes were used in 2009 usda 2011 pesticides vary within and between classes with respect to physiochemical properties such as solubility sorption coefficients and vapor pressure all of which contribute to the likely environmental fate of a particular compound von merey et al 2016 highly soluble pesticides are likely to dissolve and move in water whereas pesticides with high sorption coefficients are more prone to movement in a particulate or suspended phase sorptive processes depend on the properties of a particular compound and organic inorganic composition within the soil yen et al 2000 pesticides lost from production areas via irf can contaminate water resources and may be toxic to local biota pesticide loss from production areas may limit the effectiveness with which applied compounds control for pests bearing financial implications for growers if resulting in crop loss due to reduced quality or mortality in agricultural operations collecting irf for recycled irrigation use pesticide residues particularly herbicides may be present in bioactive levels that may damage crops poudyal and cregg 2019 container crop production provides many advantages including improved homogeneity of growing conditions easier movement of plants increased production density and faster growth agro and zheng 2014 majsztrik et al 2017 however producing plants in containers has unique challenges limitations dictated by container volume substrate hydraulic properties and plant evapotranspiration can rapidly deplete substrate stored water necessitating frequent oftentimes daily irrigation irrigation of container plants grown in containers 19 l is commonly applied via overhead systems providing water to the entire production area encompassing plant canopies container surfaces and inter container spaces beeson and knox 1991 majsztrik et al 2017 applied water shed by the plant canopy outside of containers or that lands in the inter container spaces typically 74 87 for overhead irrigation contributes to irf davies et al 2016 million and yeager 2015 pershey et al 2015 the inefficiencies common to overhead delivery are capable of producing considerable volumes of irf increasing agrochemical mobility majsztrik et al 2017 pershey et al 2015 warsaw et al 2009 micro irrigation such as in container spray stakes deliver water directly within the container however this practice is often used for crops produced in larger containers or crops spaced in low densities garber et al 2002 sensors that measure substrate volumetric moisture content θ can also be used to apply irrigation more precisely incrocci et al 2019 lea cox et al 2013 warsaw et al 2009 demonstrated overhead irrigation applied based on replenishing 100 and 75 of crop water use reduced irrigation volumes by 45 and 59 compared to a control of 190 m3 ha 1 d 1 reducing surface irf generation by 66 and 79 this study investigated movement of nine pesticides varying in physiochemical properties and mobility classes and partitioning between irrigation surface and subsurface irf when using either overhead systems or micro irrigation systems spray stakes applying water based on θ compared to a typical 190 m3 ha 1 d 1 practice within a model nursery we hypothesized 1 reducing water application volume would reduce irf and pesticide movement 2 reducing eliminating non target water interception would further reduce irf and pesticide movement 3 that irrigating more efficiently would affect surface irf more than subsurface irf 4 more water and pesticides would move in surface than subsurface irf and 5 early reductions in irf and pesticide movement would result in overall reductions in total pesticide movement 2 materials and methods 2 1 research nursery a research nursery was constructed at the michigan state university horticulture and teaching research center htrc in holt mi latitude 42 67 longitude 84 48 with sixteen raised beds for replicates the experimental raised beds were arranged in two parallel rectangular blocks measuring 61 7 62 m each with the length running north to south and separated by a 1 8 m alley each rectangular block was divided into eight individual 7 62 7 62 0 6 m lxwxh beds for a total of 16 experimental beds abdi et al 2021 the experimental nursery was designed to collect all of the surface and subsurface return flow of each individual bed therefore the existing soil within each raised bed was graded in a manner to funnel water to a low point within each bed the center point of the outside wall of each raised bed native soil within individual beds was graded to a 2 slope towards a center swale funneling water to the outer eastern or western edge of each bed within the two rectangular blocks a 7 62 cm diameter hole was drilled at this low point in order to allow water to exit a 9 1 9 1 m impermeable ethylene propylene diene monomer pondliner firestone pondgard 45mil 1 14 mm nashville tn usa was placed over the graded sub base and up the interior walls over the pond liner 0 3 m of washed natural sand clay free with particle size range of 0 75 9 5 mm was placed and graded in the same manner as the soil sub base and covered with black woven polypropylene landscape fabric de witt sblt6300 sikeston mo usa at the low point where the sand fabric layer was graded towards another 7 62 cm diameter hole was drilled this allowed water that is lost to surface return flow to exit over the fabric layer whereas all water that infiltrated and percolated through the sand layer would be collected within the individual bed and would drain through the sub base drain hole bulkhead fittings were installed in both the surface and subsurface return flow holes providing a water tight seal with plumbing connections to individual 378 l polyethylene tanks duracast manufacturer number 900100 1 2 lake wales fl usa via 4 03 cm inside diameter schedule 40 pvc for collection of surface and subsurface irf collection tanks were buried 15 2 cm below soil level and anchored with concrete 2 2 plant material a total of 15 16 beds were used to produce plants with one bed serving as a blank where no plants were used individual raised beds had 81 plants split between four taxa and produced in 11 3 l containers the four taxa used in this study were cornus sericea l farrow hydrangea paniculata sieb limelight rosa x lindl meipeporia and spiraea japonica l smnsjmfp received from a commercial propagation nursery spring meadow nursery grand haven mi the order of placement on each raised bed was randomly assigned with plants maintained in groups by taxa fertilizer applications of 61 4 g per container 4973 g per bed of a 17 3 2 10 formulation 17 nitrogen from ammonium nitrate 3 2 phosphorus from ammonium phosphate 10 potassium from soluble potash with secondary and micronutrients and a 5 6 month longevity at 27 c harrell s lakeland fl usa were applied on 11 june 2018 2 3 irrigation installation all beds were fitted with 89 µm

rainbird cp075 asuza ca irrigation was applied via overhead sprinklers k rain rn300 adj riviera beach fl or a micro irrigation delivery method individual container spray stakes netafim 22500 002030 flow rate 12 1 l h 1 tel aviv yafo israel overhead sprinklers were located at the corners of the 6 1 6 1 m area within each bed while spray stake irrigated beds also had a manifold of four 6 1 m sections of polyethylene tubing adjacent to plant rows providing water for spray stakes 2 4 irrigation control and sensor installation all irrigation systems were managed via wireless sensor and control network using sensorweb software mayim llc pittsburgh pa usa with computer communication devices installed in the main htrc building solenoid valves were controlled via direct current battery powered nodes model nc24 meter group inc pullman wa usa with each node controlling four beds nodes were installed on the side wall of the western raised beds and oriented towards the communication devices in the htrc building capacitance substrate moisture sensors model 10hs meter group inc connected to monitoring nodes model em50r meter group inc were used to monitor θ the percentage corresponding to the volume of water within a volume of substrate or m3 water m3 substrate where each bed had four moisture sensors set to take measurements at 5 min intervals sensors were randomly assigned to one plant per taxa per bed inserted horizontally into the substrate 24 cm below the top rim of the container to go through the middle of the container 2 5 irrigation treatments a control overhead irrigation applying 190 m3 ha 1 d 1 was compared to two irrigation treatments irrigating based on θ one via overhead application oh and the other using spray stakes ss container capacity cc was assessed for each bed prior to treatment initiation with irrigation treatments intended to return θ to cc a pine bark peat moss blend 85 15 v v pb and a pine bark coconut coir mix 80 20 v v pbc were the substrates used in this study renewed earth otsego mi usa measured cc of both substrates was 38 the study was organized with five distinct combinations one control four treatments each with three replicates control pb oh pb oh pbc ss pb ss pbc for data analysis reasons explained in section 2 9 the substrate factor was removed from the analysis of variance procedures therefore beds were only assessed pooled by irrigation method control n 3 oh n 6 ss n 6 for the overhead irrigated beds based on θ up to 190 m3 ha 1 d 1 was applied split over three separate 63 3 m3 ha 1 cycles allowing five minutes to elapse between cycles to allow for θ readings ss beds irrigated based on cc would irrigate up to three 1 l per container cycles again with five minutes between cycles for θ readings if θ was at cc irrigation would not be applied either at the start of the day or between each cycle irrigation was applied from 9 00 10 00 for control replicates with both treatments beginning at 10 00 and ending no later than 11 10 the sensor in the h paniculata replicate for each bed was used as the sole basis for oh and ss due to its water consumption and sensitivity to drought stress relative to the other three taxa irrigation treatments were randomly assigned to each bed for the bed that was left as a blank without plants 190 m3 ha 1 d 1 of overhead irrigation was applied to a bed without plants and not receiving pesticides in order to establish baseline data treatments initiated on 11 june 2018 and concluded on 11 october 2018 2 6 pesticide applications nine pesticides were applied over the duration of this study in three distinct monitoring periods each consisting of 16 days each monitoring period had an herbicide insecticide and a fungicide applied with herbicides applied first followed by the insecticide fungicide application as a tank mix table 1 pesticides were selected based on their physiochemical properties and commonality in nursery production and organized based on mccall s koc sorption coefficient for affinity to organic carbon class and fao mobility classifications into three groups table 2 pre emergent herbicide was applied first followed by watering in using overhead irrigation per label recommendation after surface irf from watering in ceased insecticides fungicides tank mix were applied therefore herbicides have an additional sample date all pesticides were applied as liquids according to ornamental crop label rate via wagon mounted sprayer connected by hose to a four nozzle boom measuring 1 52 m across with a 1 83 m spray width boom width allowed the 6 1 6 1 m area to be divided into thirds with passes starting at the low point and moving uphill west to east for the western block of raised beds vice verse for the eastern block herbicide applications required one pass over each third to achieve desired application rates while the tank mix required two passes prior to application events nozzles were calibrated to a minimum of 95 uniformity in spray output and applicator walking speed was calibrated to provide desired application rates the herbicides isoxaben oxyfluorfen and prodiamine were applied first in each respective monitoring period using a teejet model 8002 nozzle wheaton il usa via spray boom followed by watering in afterwards insecticide fungicide tank mix was applied using teejet model 8006 nozzles nozzles were tested prior to each spray event to ensure uniformity in spray output and applicator walking speed was calibrated to provide desired application rates teejet 8002 average flow per nozzle 1110 ml min 1 teejet 8006 average flow per nozzle 2165 ml min 1 both 80 angles applicator walking speed 3 93 km hr 1 the first application date was 11 june 2018 consisting of isoxaben acephate bifenthrin and mefenoxam following isoxaben application all beds received 190 m3 ha 1 of overhead irrigation to water in the herbicide during monitoring periods 2 and 3 the treatments received the minimum watering in volume while the control received its typical daily application volume this was done to assess the potential for more efficient irrigation practices to specifically reduce herbicide movement following watering in events the second application date was 9 july 2018 consisting of oxyfluorfen acephate chlorpyrifos and triflumizole following oxyfluorfen application the control received 190 m3 ha 1 of overhead irrigation while the treatments received the label minimum recommended watering in rate of 63 3 m3 ha 1 the third application date was 20 august 2018 consisting of prodiamine acephate and thiophanate methyl following prodiamine application the control received 190 m3 ha 1 of overhead irrigation and treatments received the label minimum watering in rate of 126 6 m3 ha 1 no other irrigation was applied following watering in events on the day of pesticide application 2 7 sampling protocol collection tanks were emptied 24 h prior to sampling to allow accumulation of subsurface irf over a full day and surface irf collection in response to an irrigation event samples were collected following herbicide application day 0 from surface irf tanks and from surface and subsurface irf tanks 1 2 4 8 and 16 days after application for each monitoring period water height in collection tanks was measured using a meter stick and converted to liters based on tank dimensions to quantify surface and subsurface irf volumes a sump pump with a hose attachment was inserted into the tank and ran for 10 s prior to sampling in order to clear the hose samples were collected in a 950 ml glass amber bottle qorpak glc02164 clinton pa samples were spiked with 75 μl of acetic acid was added for sample stabilization 2 8 pesticide chemical analysis water samples were analyzed at the organic contaminants analytical research laboratory in the soil and water sciences department university of florida gainesville fl using sample preparation extraction techniques and instrument conditions described in supplementary text 1 supplementary table 1 and supplementary table 2 2 9 experimental design and statistical analysis a completely randomized design was used for this study with irrigation treatment substrate treatment and plant placement for individual beds randomly assigned data was analyzed using sas v9 4 cary nc usa the volume of irrigation applied was evaluated using analysis of variance anova using the procglm procedure when irrigation treatment effects were significant p 0 05 means were separated using tukey s test in the lsmeans prompt the average number of days irrigation was applied was calculated as the average of the number of days each replicate within a treatment applied any irrigation at all assessment of average surface and subsurface irf volumes throughout the season used only sample days with 5 mm of precipitation surface and subsurface irf volume pesticide concentration and pesticide load were subject to anova using the procmixed procedure with repeated measures when treatment effects were significant p 0 05 means were separated using tukey s tests in the lsmeans prompt all variable means and standard errors were calculated using the procmeans feature regression models when f values were significant p 0 05 were used to model pesticide load over the 16 day period using the procglm procedure anova by date for surface and subsurface irf showed a substrate by irrigation interaction on 6 33 sample dates and main effect due to substrate type on 2 33 sample dates but main effect due to irrigation on 21 33 sample dates therefore only irrigation main effects are presented anova by date for pesticide load in irf showed a substrate by irrigation interaction on 7 110 sample dates and main effect due to substrate type on 3 110 sample dates but main effect due to irrigation for 39 110 sample dates therefore only irrigation main effects are presented all values are expressed on a per hectare basis 3 results and discussion 3 1 water applied and irf irrigating using θ reduced water use across all three monitoring periods compared to the control oh reduced water applied by 42 63 and ss reduced water applied compared to the control by 73 81 over the three monitoring periods during the second and third monitoring periods ss reduced water use compared to oh by 54 67 the reduced volume of irrigation applied in the treatments often reduced the volume of surface irf compared to the control especially when irrigating using ss warsaw et al 2009 investigated using θ based irrigation practices in container nursery production and the effects it had on irf volume our results were consistent with their findings where irrigating based on θ reduced water use up to 44 while also reducing irf by between 66 and 79 they posited that the reduction in irf was twofold resulting from both the reduced volume of irrigation applied as well as more substrate capacity to absorb water due to likely lower substrate θ pre irrigation mathers et al 2005 also suggested that using micro irrigation and or cyclic irrigation can reduce water use as well as runoff for both treatments if the target θ was already met irrigation would not be applied and thus eliminating any surface return flow ss drastically reduced surface irf as the intermittent application cycles leaching and matric movement through substrates and lower application volumes often times resulted in no surface irf being generated in general surface return flow in ss irrigated beds was almost entirely precipitation induced subsurface irf for all treatments was similarly responsive to precipitation events with greater volumes of subsurface irf produced in the aftermath of a rain event 3 1 1 monitoring period 1 a total of 2734 m3 of irrigation was applied to the control which was greater than oh 1025 m3 and ss 531 m3 the control consistently applied more daily irrigation than both treatments fig 1a the control applied irrigation on all 16 dates which was greater than the average number of days irrigation was applied for oh 10 33 and ss 11 5 the total volume of surface irf between day 1 and 16 was 70 lower for oh and 95 lower for ss compared to the control surface irf volume collected in the first monitoring period was consistently greater in the control than both treatments on each sample date fig 1b the control and both treatments consistently generated subsurface irf fig 1c oh subsurface return flow volumes over the first two days were markedly higher than the control or ss this is likely attributed to oh producing less surface irf via reduced application volumes and delays between cycles and that the applied water had time to infiltrate and percolate through the fabric and sand profile 3 1 2 monitoring period 2 a total of 2852 m3 was applied to the control 1601 m3 to oh and 529 m3 to ss across all measured dates the control applied a greater volume of irrigation than ss fig 2a oh applied less irrigation than the control on 5 of 8 measurement dates following day 0 while also applying more than the ss on 3 sample dates the control applied irrigation on all 16 dates which was greater than oh 11 6 and ss 9 5 throughout monitoring period 2 oh and ss reduced the total volume of surface irf compared to the control by 70 and 95 the control consistently generated greater volumes of surface irf than both treatments throughout monitoring period 2 fig 2b subsurface irf was typically statistically equivalent between the control and all treatments however similarly to monitoring period 1 oh generated greater volumes of subsurface irf than the control or ss fig 2c 3 1 3 monitoring period 3 a total of 2062 m3 was applied to the control which was greater than oh 1120 m3 and ss 550 m3 irrigation was not applied to the control or treatments on day 1 or 8 due to precipitation the control applied a greater volume of irrigation than ss on all days however oh irrigation volumes were occasionally equivalent to the control fig 3a the control was irrigated on 14 dates whereas oh applied irrigation on 9 33 days and ss on 10 5 days throughout monitoring period 3 total surface irf volumes were reduced by 66 and 84 using oh and ss compared to the control greater volumes of surface irf were consistently generated in the control vs both treatments on all sample dates fig 3b subsurface irf volumes generated by oh were typically greater than the control and ss particularly over the first four sample dates of monitoring period 3 fig 3c 3 2 pesticide dynamics 3 2 1 acephate across the three monitoring periods nearly 2 3 times more acephate was recovered in surface irrigation return flow from the control than oh ss typically reduced eliminated surface irf generation with total acephate recovered in surface irf approximately 4 1000 times lower than the control the amount of acephate recovered in surface irf represented a substantial portion of the amount applied with 83 107 of the 553 g recovered in the control 24 54 in oh and 1 22 in ss across all three rounds table 3 conversely to the total load recovered in surface irf oh exported 2 3 times more acephate than the control in subsurface irf over the three monitoring periods ss exported a similar total load of acephate in subsurface irf as the control during round 2 but nearly twice as much for round 1 and 3 roughly 3 28 of applied acephate was recovered in subsurface irf from the control 14 50 for oh and 7 53 in ss demonstrating how subsurface irf is a critical vector in the movement of acephate regardless of irrigation practice for the control total acephate recovery was 3 5 27 times greater in surface irf than subsurface irf however for oh total acephate recovery in surface irf was typically equivalent to subsurface irf load recovered during the second and third monitoring period but approximately 3 2 times greater during the first monitoring period considering that ss reduced and often eliminated surface irf subsurface irf was the predominant pathway of loss for acephate nearly 2 3 times as much acephate was recovered in subsurface irf than surface irf from ss during the second and third monitoring period while in monitoring period one it was approximately 75 times greater 3 2 1 1 acephate monitoring period 1 the control exported a total of 591 g of acephate in surface irf table 3 the total load recovered in surface irf from oh and ss was 256 g and 0 51 g or 46 and 1 of applied acephate acephate load recovered in surface irf was consistently greater in the control than either treatment on any day throughout the monitoring period fig 1d both the control and oh exhibited a linear decrease in surface irf acephate load when both axes were transformed supplementary table 3 the highest acephate concentrations were measured in surface irf for the control and oh on the first two days following applications day 1 control 4420 µg l 1 oh 2590 µg l 1 day 2 control 1010 µg l 1 oh 630 µg l 1 supplementary table 4 subsurface irf samples over the 5 sample dates yielded 22 g 79 g and 39 g in the control oh and ss respectively corresponding to 4 14 and 7 of applied acephate table 3 acephate load recovered in subsurface irf was typically equivalent with the exception of day 2 where oh exhibited a spike in both load fig 1e and concentration supplementary table 4 ss exhibited a quadratic relationship when both axes were transformed supplementary table 3 suggesting a lag effect occurred in acephate movement through the sand profile of ss beds subsurface irf concentrations of acephate were typically equivalent however oh had a peak concentration of 1168 µg l 1 on day 2 and ss had a peak concentration of 1327 µg l 1 on day 4 supplementary table 4 combining total surface and subsurface acephate load 613 g 335 g and 39 2 g were recovered in the control oh and ss respectively corresponding to 110 61 and 7 of applied acephate table 3 3 2 1 2 acephate monitoring period 2 total acephate load recovered in surface irf was 461 g 134 g and 26 0 g in the control oh and ss respectively corresponding to 83 24 and 5 of applied acephate table 3 the load of acephate recovered in surface irf from the control was often equivalent to oh following day 1 fig 2d oh exhibited a linear decrease in surface irf load when both axes were transformed supplementary table 3 the concentration of acephate in surface irf was nearly 3000 µg l 1 for the control on day 1 while concentrations exceeded 1000 µg l 1 for oh on days 1 2 and 4 supplementary table 4 total subsurface irf acephate recovered was 54 1 g 125 g and 60 8 g for the control oh and ss respectively representing 10 23 and 11 of applied acephate table 3 there were no differences between the control or treatments in subsurface acephate load on day 8 and 16 however both treatments had exhibited spikes on day 1 and 4 fig 2e the control and both treatments exhibited a linear decrease in subsurface irf acephate load when transforming both axes supplementary table 3 peak concentrations of acephate in subsurface irf occurred on day 2 for the control 3820 µg l 1 and day 1 for oh 1330 µg l 1 and ss 1000 µg l 1 supplementary table 4 total load recovered in combined surface and subsurface irf yielded 515 g 259 g and 86 8 g in the control oh and ss respectively corresponding to 93 47 and 16 of applied acephate table 3 3 2 1 3 acephate monitoring period 3 total acephate load recovered in surface irf was 541 g 297 g and 124 g in the control oh and ss respectively corresponding to 98 54 and 22 of applied acephate table 3 irrigation was not applied to the control or either treatment on day 1 or 8 due to precipitation therefore ss surface irf volumes and total acephate movement 22 of applied g ha 1 were substantially greater than monitoring periods 1 1 and 2 5 acephate loads recovered in surface irf were typically greater from the control than either treatment fig 3d the control and oh exhibited a linear decrease in surface irf load of acephate when both axes were transformed supplementary table 3 acephate concentration in surface return flow peaked on day 1 which was precipitation induced for both the control 3120 µg l 1 and ss 1980 µg l 1 whereas peak surface return flow concentrations occurred on day 2 for oh 3130 µg l 1 supplementary table 4 total acephate recovered in subsurface irf yielded 157 g 276 g and 295 g for the control oh and ss respectively representing 28 50 and 53 of applied acephate table 3 subsurface acephate loads were greatest on day 1 for the control and ss and day 2 for oh fig 3e oh exhibited a quadratic relationship increasing before decreasing and ss exhibited a linear decrease in subsurface irf acephate load when both axes were transformed suggesting a lag effect from day 1 to day 2 for oh and rapid movement for ss on day 1 supplementary table 3 subsurface concentrations peaked on day 1 for the control 3740 µg l 1 and ss 6120 µg l 1 while oh peaked on day 2 8250 µg l 1 supplementary table 4 total combined irf acephate load recovered was 697 g 574 g and 419 g ha 1 in the control oh and ss respectively corresponding to 126 104 and 76 of applied acephate table 3 acephate solubility is over 31 times greater than the next most soluble pesticide mefenoxam and 818 million times greater than the least soluble pesticide bifenthrin therefore it was hypothesized that acephate would be the most mobile of all investigated pesticides the mobility of acephate in water has been reported by sun et al 2018 where in assessing pesticide concentrations in the yangtze river acephate was present in higher concentrations than any other pesticide investigated over all three monitoring periods acephate was recovered in both greatest quantity and percentage of amount applied of all pesticides used in this study in both surface and subsurface irf table 3 similarly acephate was the pesticide with the highest concentration in both surface and subsurface irf acephate is unlikely to undergo photodegradation or volatilization ncbi 2020 however aerobic degradation is a prominent degradation mechanism where ramu and seetharaman 2014 reported that the bacterial strain pseudomonas aeruginosa strain is 6 was capable of degrading acephate and a number of other organophosphorus pesticides with efficacy maintained at concentrations as high as 1 g l 1 through irrigating to reduce both surface and subsurface irf degradative processes may occur in situ before precipitation or irrigation induced irf can move acephate 3 2 2 mefenoxam the amount of applied mefenoxam recovered was second only to acephate for both surface and subsurface irf demonstrating its capacity to move through both surface and subsurface profiles total amount of mefenoxam recovered in surface irf from the control was nearly 20 times greater than subsurface irf and for oh nearly twice as much mefenoxam was recovered in surface versus subsurface irf considering ss reduced or eliminated surface irf thus resulting in subsurface irf as the prominent vector for movement approximately 22 times more mefenoxam was recovered in subsurface irf versus surface irf nearly twice as much mefenoxam was recovered in surface irf from the control 1 68 g than oh 0 95 g while the total load of mefenoxam recovered from ss 0 02 g was approximately 120 times lower than the control representing 9 5 and 1 of applied mefenoxam respectively the load of mefenoxam recovered in surface irf was typically greater in the control versus both treatments fig 1 f a linear decrease was observed in the surface irf load of both the control and oh when both axes were transformed supplementary table 3 mefenoxam concentrations in surface irf peaked on day 1 for the control and oh at 9 98 and 8 22 µg l 1 however as ss often eliminated surface irf concentrations never exceeded 1 µg l 1 supplementary table 4 mefenoxam total load recovered in subsurface irf was 0 5 g in oh which was approximately 4 5 times greater than the control 0 086 g and nearly 1 5 times greater than ss 0 31 g the amount of the applied 18 2 g recovered in subsurface irf was 1 in the control and roughly 3 and 2 for the oh and ss mefenoxam load recovered in subsurface irf exhibited peaks on day 2 for oh and day 4 for ss fig 1g a quadratic equation was significant for ss when both axes were transformed supplementary table 3 mefenoxam load recovered in subsurface irf from ss peaked on day 4 suggesting a lag effect occurred the concentration of mefenoxam in subsurface irf for the control and oh peaked on day 2 at 2 73 and 8 32 µg l 1 ss peaked on day 4 at 11 39 µg l 1 supplementary table 4 the total load of mefenoxam recovered over the monitoring period in combined irf was 1 77 g 1 45 g and 0 33 g for the control oh and ss respectively corresponding to 9 7 7 9 and 1 8 of applied mefenoxam table 3 mefenoxam was hypothesized to be present in surface and subsurface irf based on solubility and low koc and was not expected to volatilize table 2 the mobility of mefenoxam was investigated by gardner and branham 2001 where turf or barren soil plots received either static 10 mm 5 times per week or estimated evapotranspiration based irrigation regardless of the irrigation practice mefenoxam rapidly infiltrated through soil profiles in their study the quadratic model for mefenoxam movement in subsurface irf from ss in our study suggested a lag effect occurred where the reduced volume and non target application of irrigation applied relative to overhead delivery methods delayed mefenoxam movement through subsurface profiles mefenoxam is unlikely to undergo photolysis or hydrolysis triantafyllidis et al 2012 however microbial degradation has been considered the primary pathway of degradation gardner and branham 2001 monkiedje and spiteller 2005 the results suggest that rapid movement of mefenoxam in surface irf is likely to occur shortly after applying this compound and that reduced irrigation volumes and or applying irrigation with more precision can delay its movement in subsurface irf 3 2 3 bifenthrin the control exported 0 32 g of bifenthrin in surface irf roughly 2 5 times more than oh 0 126 g and 110 times more than ss 0 00284 g however this amount represented under 0 1 of applied bifenthrin in all cases table 3 bifenthrin was almost always below the limit of detection 0 125 µg l 1 in subsurface irf samples yielding total amounts recovered of 0 02 g across the control and both treatments this corresponded to 0 01 of applied bifenthrin results demonstrate that surface irf is a more likely vector in bifenthrin movement than subsurface irf bifenthrin load recovered in surface irf from the control was consistently greater than both treatments on each day fig 1h the control and oh exhibited a linear decrease in bifenthrin load exported over time via surface irf when both axes were transformed supplementary table 3 with the exception of day 1 where the control and oh exported concentrations of 1 9 µg l 1 and 1 41 µg l 1 all concentrations were below 0 7 µg l 1 in surface irf supplementary table 4 total bifenthrin load recovered in subsurface irf was 16 7 mg 12 8 mg and 8 44 mg in the control oh and ss respectively table 3 the concentration of bifenthrin in subsurface irf was typically below the limit of detection and never exceeded 0 23 µg l 1 on any date for the control and treatments supplementary table 4 therefore subsurface irf load calculations are a reflection of the volume of irf fig 1i combining total surface and subsurface irf bifenthrin load the control oh and ss exported 336 139 and 11 3 mg respectively of the 130 g applied 0 3 was recovered across the control and treatments in the total irf table 3 bifenthrin was hypothesized to move predominantly in surface return flow via erosive detachment of sediments particles and to exhibit minimal movement in subsurface return flow considering its low solubility table 2 while the low solubility of bifenthrin suggests volatilization from moist soils or surface water may occur the strong sorptive tendencies of bifenthrin may limit this pathway of degradation ncbi 2020 despite bifenthrin being considered a fairly immobile compound potential risk to water bodies may occur based on persistence in the environment and wide use sardiña et al 2019 and bioactivity at low concentrations for aquatic life bertotto et al 2019 brander et al 2016 bifenthrin is considered unlikely to photodegrade jin et al 2009 however microbial degradation by species such as pseudomonas sp cb2 and stenotrophomonas acidaminiphila have been reported lee et al 2004 zhang et al 2018 weston et al 2009 reported concentrations of 0 073 µg l 1 and 1 2 µg g 1 of bifenthrin in water and suspended sediments collected from a californian urban creek this was similar to the peak concentrations of bifenthrin in surface irf in our study control 1 9 µg l 1 oh 1 41 µg l 1 both measured the day following application however all subsequent sample dates were below 1 µg l 1 concentrations of bifenthrin in subsurface irf were nearly universally below the limit of detection and never exceeded 0 25 µg l 1 the results demonstrate that subsurface movement is unlikely to occur with bifenthrin however potential for sorbed bifenthrin to be erosively detached and transported in surface irf represents the primary vector of movement particularly in the days immediately after pesticide application therefore reducing surface irf through lower irrigation volumes oh and precision application of water ss can reduce or nearly eliminate the movement of bifenthrin 3 2 4 isoxaben across the total sample dates where isoxaben loads were collected from surface irf watering in event and days 1 2 4 8 and 16 86 4 g were recovered from the control which was nearly twice as much as oh 44 3 g and 4 times greater than ss 19 1 g table 3 this corresponded to 10 5 and 2 of applied isoxaben recovered via this vector for the control oh and ss respectively total subsurface isoxaben recovered in oh 6 07 g was nearly 4 times greater than the control 1 41 g and nearly 3 times greater than ss 2 34 g in all cases representing 0 1 of applied isoxaben comparing the amount of isoxaben recovered in surface irf versus subsurface irf nearly 61 7 3 and 8 2 times more isoxaben was recovered in the control oh and ss respectively demonstrating that surface irf is a more likely vector in isoxaben movement than subsurface irf isoxaben load recovered in surface irf was typically greater in the control than either treatment fig 1j isoxaben load in surface irf exhibited a linear decrease when both axes were transformed for the control and oh supplementary table 3 surface irf concentrations were greatest on the watering in event and day 1 where the control and both treatments had peak concentrations exceeding 340 µg l 1 supplementary table 4 isoxaben load recovered in subsurface irf was typically equivalent on every sample date however oh reached a noticeable peak on day 2 compared to the control and ss fig 1k a linear decrease was identified in subsurface irf for the control when both axes were transformed while ss exhibited an increasing then decreasing quadratic relationship supplementary table 3 indicating a lag effect occurred isoxaben concentrations in subsurface irf peaked on day 1 for the control 111 µg l 1 and ss 117 µg l 1 and day 2 for oh 99 4 µg l 1 supplementary table 4 combining surface and subsurface irf the control oh and ss exported a total of 87 8 g 50 4 g and 21 5 g respectively corresponding to 10 6 and 2 of the 867 g applied table 3 isoxaben is considered moderately soluble based on a solubility of 1 42 mg l 1 but is only slightly mobile based on its koc which suggests it is most likely to adsorb to sediments or other materials but may exhibit some mobility in water table 2 volatilization is not expected to be a major pathway of degradation from either dry or moist soils nor is it considered likely to hydrolyze based on the composition of its functional group however photodegradation may occur with isoxaben ncbi 2020 bacterial degradation particularly in aerobic and moist soils has been reported to be a prominent pathway in the dissipation of isoxaben camper et al 2001 walker 1987 isoxaben movement in nursery irf was reported to be greatest on the days immediately following application briggs et al 1998 but declined with each subsequent irrigation event following the day of application in our study the majority of isoxaben was transported in surface irf on the day of application and first two days following application representing 96 97 and 89 of the total amount recovered for the control oh and ss respectively isoxaben exhibited some mobility in subsurface irf however surface irf is the predominant vector and irrigating as conservatively as possible immediately following isoxaben application can effectively reduce the movement of this compound 3 2 5 triflumizole across the total 5 sample dates 5 99 g of triflumizole was recovered in surface irf from the control nearly 4 times greater than oh 1 66 g and 45 times greater than ss 0 13 g corresponding to recovering approximately 2 of the applied triflumizole from the control 1 for oh and 0 1 for ss approximately twice as much triflumizole was recovered in subsurface irf from oh 0 2 g vs the control 0 1 g and three times as much as ss 0 08 g however this amounted to 0 2 g total recovery for the control and each treatment or 0 1 of the triflumizole applied table 3 comparing the amount of triflumizole recovered in surface irf versus subsurface irf nearly 58 8 4 and 1 7 times more triflumizole was recovered in the control oh and ss respectively demonstrating that surface irf is a more likely vector in triflumizole movement than subsurface irf triflumizole was generally recovered in greater amounts of surface irf from the control on each sample date particularly early on however the difference was typically only noticeable compared to ss fig 2f the control exhibited a linear decrease in surface irf triflumizole load when both axes were transformed supplementary table 3 surface concentrations for the control peaked at 38 3 µg l 1 on day 1 for oh at 15 86 µg l 1 on day 2 and ss at 4 07 µg l 1 on day 4 supplementary table 4 triflumizole load recovered in subsurface irf was similar between the control and both treatments on all sample dates with all of them peaking on day 4 fig 2g subsurface concentrations for the control peaked at 5 65 µg l 1 on day 4 for oh at 2 57 µg l 1 on day 8 and ss at 1 17 µg l 1 on day 1 supplementary table 4 total triflumizole load recovered in combined surface and subsurface irf yielded 6 09 g 1 85 g and 0 21 g in the control oh and ss respectively corresponding to 2 1 1 and 0 1 of applied triflumizole table 3 triflumizole is considered to be readily soluble at 10 mg l 1 however it is considered to have low to slight mobility based on a koc of 1400 nor is it expected to volatilize table 2 triflumizole is widely used in numerous agricultural sectors therefore increasing the risk of surface water contamination where it has been reported to be detrimental towards freshwater algal species such as chlorella vulgaris xi et al 2019 the results demonstrate that minimizing surface irf particularly after triflumizole application is the most effective way to limit the movement of this compound 3 2 6 chlorpyrifos across the total 5 sample dates 4 54 g of chlorpyrifos was recovered in surface irf from the control nearly 5 5 times greater than oh 0 84 g and over 100 times greater than the ss 0 04 g considering ss typically reduced or eliminated surface irf generation table 3 in all cases this amounted to 0 1 of the applied chlorpyrifos recovered in surface irf less than 0 06 g of chlorpyrifos was recovered in subsurface irf for the control and either treatment representing 0 0001 of applied chlorpyrifos comparing the amount of chlorpyrifos recovered in surface irf versus subsurface irf nearly 179 14 2 and 1 2 times more chlorpyrifos was recovered in the control oh and ss respectively demonstrating that surface irf is a more likely vector in chlorpyrifos movement than subsurface irf chlorpyrifos load was typically greater in the control than both treatments on day 1 and 2 however were similar on day 4 and beyond fig 2h chlorpyrifos load in surface irf water from the control exhibited a linear decrease when both axes were transformed supplementary table 3 chlorpyrifos concentrations in surface irf peaked for the control and oh on day 1 at 33 89 µg l 1 and 15 65 µg l 1 ss often eliminated surface irf and the peak concentration was 1 27 µg l 1 on day 4 supplementary table 4 subsurface irf chlorpyrifos loads were typically equivalent on each date fig 2i a quadratic decrease between chlorpyrifos load recovered in subsurface irf and days after application was identified in both oh and ss when transforming both axes whereas no significant relationship was identified in the control supplementary table 3 chlorpyrifos load recovered in subsurface irf from ss increased from day 2 to day 4 followed by decreasing from day 4 to day 8 suggesting a lag effect occurred total chlorpyrifos load recovered in subsurface irf was 0 03 g 0 06 g and 0 04 g in the control oh and ss respectively corresponding to 1 of applied chlorpyrifos table 3 subsurface irf concentrations of chlorpyrifos never exceeded 1 µg l 1 supplementary table 4 the total combined irf chlorpyrifos load was 4 56 g 0 89 g and 0 08 g for the control oh and ss respectively accounting for 1 of applied chlorpyrifos table 3 chlorpyrifos is considered moderately soluble however based on a koc range of 995 31 000 may be considered moderately mobile immobile table 2 the lack of subsurface movement exhibited by chlorpyrifos was consistent with milhome et al 2015 findings of chlorpyrifos below detection in groundwater samples where in our study concentrations in subsurface irf never exceed 1 µg l 1 chlorpyrifos is likely to degrade via volatilization photolysis and or microbial degradation ncbi 2020 reducing surface irf through improved irrigation practices can maintain chlorpyrifos on production surfaces and allow these degradation practices to occur 3 2 7 oxyfluorfen nearly 3 times as much oxyfluorfen was recovered in surface irf from the control 0 22 g than oh 0 08 g and 11 more than ss 0 02 g this corresponded to recovering approximately 0 0001 of the applied oxyfluorfen from the control and far less for either treatment approximately 3 times as much oxyfluorfen was recovered in subsurface irf from oh vs the control and 2 times as much from oh vs the ss however this amounted to 0 05 g total recovery for the control and each treatment or 0 0001 of the oxyfluorfen applied comparing the amount of oxyfluorfen recovered in surface versus subsurface irf nearly 15 and 1 5 times more oxyfluorfen was recovered in the control and oh however ss had nearly 1 6 times more oxyfluorfen recovered in subsurface than surface irf results demonstrate that surface irf is a more likely vector in oxyfluorfen movement than subsurface irf oxyfluorfen loads in surface irf were typically greater than either treatment on each sample date fig 2j oxyfluorfen concentrations in surface irf universally averaged below 1 µg l 1 supplementary table 4 in total collected subsurface irf the control oh and ss recovered 0 02 g 0 05 g and 0 03 g respectively in all cases accounting for 0 01 of applied oxyfluorfen table 3 the load of oxyfluorfen recovered in subsurface irf was generally equivalent on each sample date fig 2k a linear decrease in oxyfluorfen load was observed in ss subsurface irf when transforming both axes supplementary table 3 an increase in ss subsurface irf load was observed from day 2 to day 4 suggesting the potential for a lag effect to occur oxyfluorfen concentration in subsurface irf across the control and treatments was universally below 1 µg l 1 across all dates supplementary table 4 in total combined oxyfluorfen irf samples 0 24 g 0 13 g and 0 05 g were recovered in the control oh and ss respectively universally corresponding to 1 of applied oxyfluorfen table 3 oxyfluorfen is considered slightly soluble 0 12 mg l 1 and based on a koc of 8900 is considered slightly mobile to immobile table 2 oxyfluorfen is not expected to volatilize based on henry s law constant 8 2 10 7 atm m3 mol 1 however microbial degradation is considered a prominent degradation mechanism ncbi 2020 the low concentrations of oxyfluorfen detected in surface and subsurface irf universally below 1 µg l 1 as well as the lack of mobility in subsurface profiles are consistent with riley et al 1994 finding of oxyfluorfen samples being below the level of solubility and alister et al 2009 finding that over 74 of oxyfluorfen was found in the top 2 5 cm of soil after 90 and 340 days following application in a vineyard system oxyfluorfen dissipation in soils was investigated by wu et al 2019 where they found that higher ph and organic matter content could increase degradation rate while soils with larger clay fractions reduced the degradation rate in response to less pore space for oxyfluorfen spread considering that this study used sand for its soil profile this may have enhanced degradation as there was no organic matter or clay and greater pore space 3 2 8 thiophanate methyl total load of thiophanate methyl recovered in surface irf from the control 42 8 g was 4 times greater than oh 10 8 g and 6 times greater than ss 7 36 g of the 482 g of thiophanate methyl applied roughly 9 was recovered in surface irf from the control while oh and ss led to total recovery of 2 2 and 1 5 thiophanate methyl total load recovered in subsurface irf was approximately 3 g in the control 2 g for oh and 2 75 g for ss however in all cases it accounted for 1 of the thiophanate methyl applied comparing amount of thiophanate methyl recovered in surface irf versus subsurface irf nearly 14 5 5 and 2 7 times more thiophanate methyl was recovered in the control oh and ss respectively demonstrating that surface irf is a more likely vector in thiophanate methyl movement than subsurface irf a greater load of thiophanate methyl was typically recovered in surface irf samples from the control than either treatment particularly on early sample dates fig 3f a linear decrease was identified surface irf thiophanate methyl load for the control and oh when both axes were transformed supplementary table 3 the concentration of thiophanate methyl in surface irf were highest on day 1 with peak concentrations of 341 7 µg l 1 for the control and 130 8 µg l 1 and 134 0 µg l 1 in oh and ss supplementary table 4 the load of thiophanate methyl recovered in subsurface irf was generally equivalent between the control and both treatments on all sample dates with a daily load for the control or either treatment never exceeding 3 g ha 1 fig 3g a linear decrease in subsurface irf thiophanate methyl load was identified in oh and ss when both axes were transformed supplementary table 3 subsurface thiophanate methyl concentrations peaked on day 1 for the control 71 2 µg l 1 and ss 70 7 µg l 1 and on day 2 for oh 66 1 µg l 1 supplementary table 4 total combined irf thiophanate methyl loads yielded 45 8 g 12 8 g and 10 1 g in the control oh and ss respectively corresponding to 9 5 2 7 and 2 1 of applied thiophanate methyl table 3 with a solubility of 26 6 mg l 1 and a koc of 330 thiophanate methyl is classified as moderately mobile readily soluble table 2 and may be readily mobile in irf or precipitation events shortly after application briggs et al 1998 photolysis and volatilization are unlikely pathways of degradation for thiophanate methyl however microbial degradation is considered a likely pathway briggs et al 2002 cycon et al 2011 thiophanate methyl in movement in irf from container nurseries has been reported to be greatest shortly following application where briggs et al 2002 reported that 3 5 7 of applied thiophanate methyl was recovered in the first irrigation event post application in the third monitoring period of our study no irrigation was applied the first day following application due to precipitation however the surface return flow generated from that precipitation event transported a similar percentage of applied thiophanate methyl control 7 2 oh 1 8 ss 1 5 as briggs et al 2002 observed concentrations of thiophanate methyl were greatest in both surface and subsurface irf the first two days following application supplementary table 4 but by day 8 were universally below 1 µg l 1 in both surface and subsurface irf the results demonstrate thiophanate methyl rapidly moves in both surface and subsurface vectors and minimizing irf shortly after this compound is applied can reduce the movement of this compound 3 2 9 prodiamine a total of 21 1 g of prodiamine were recovered in surface irf from the control nearly 10 times greater than oh 2 28 g and ss 2 69 g corresponding to approximately 1 of the applied prodiamine from the control and 0 1 either treatment in subsurface irf 0 15 g were recovered for the control and treatments representing 0 0001 of all applied prodiamine comparing prodiamine recovery in surface irf versus subsurface irf nearly 141 23 2 and 19 6 times more prodiamine was recovered in the control oh and ss respectively results demonstrate surface irf is a more likely vector in prodiamine movement than subsurface irf surface irf prodiamine loads were greater in the control than both treatments on all sample dates fig 3h a decreasing linear equation in surface irf prodiamine load was identified for the control and oh when both axes were transformed supplementary table 3 prodiamine concentrations were greatest over the day of application post watering in and the day after application peaking at 102 61 µg l 1 37 02 µg l 1 and 40 81 µg l 1 in the control oh and ss respectively supplementary table 4 prodiamine load in subsurface irf was equivalent on all sample dates and never exceeded 0 1 g ha 1 on a given sample date fig 3i subsurface irf prodiamine load from ss exhibited a quadratic increase then decrease when both axes were log transformed supplementary table 3 the total load recovered in subsurface irf was 0 15 g 0 1 g and 0 14 g for the control oh and ss respectively in all cases below 0 1 of applied prodiamine table 3 prodiamine concentrations in subsurface irf were universally below 8 µg l 1 supplementary table 4 the total load of prodiamine in combined irf was 21 3 g 2 37 g and 2 82 g in the control oh and ss respectively corresponding to 1 3 of applied prodiamine in the control and 1 in either treatment table 3 prodiamine is considered insoluble 0 13 mg l 1 and relatively immobile based on koc ranges of 5440 16 200 table 2 photolysis and microbial degradation are considered to be primary routes of dissipation stearman et al 2012 herbicides within the dinitroaniline class typically are characterized by high molecular weight predilection for hydrophobic sorption and lower mobility compared with other classes however volatilization can occur particularly in moist soils weber 1990 stearman et al 2012 investigated prodiamine removal from nursery irf using subsurface constructed wetlands where prodiamine concentrations from nursery irf of 500 3200 µg l 1 were reduced by 48 65 attributed to biodegradation and sorptive processes concentrations in our study peaked on the watering in event following application for the control 102 6 µg l 1 oh 37 µg l 1 and ss 40 8 µg l 1 however this was still substantially lower than stearman et al 2012 reducing irf and maintaining prodiamine on the production surface may allow more degradation processes to occur particularly photolysis 3 3 ecological toxicity pesticides and degradation products of pesticides such as methadimophos from acephate a potent acetylcholinesterase inhibitor in its own right may be ecologically deleterious if present in bioactive levels in water yen et al 2000 daphnia magna water flea and oncorhynchus mykiss rainbow trout are used as indicator species to evaluate the negative impacts that pesticide residues may have on aquatic ecosystems in relation to the lethal concentration that kills 50 of a test population lc50 or the concentration required to elicit 50 of the maximal biological response ec50 supplementary table 5 in assessing both of these indicator species the only pesticides exceeding either of these thresholds were bifenthrin daphnia magna 0 11 µg l 1 oncorhynchus mykiss 0 26 µg l 1 and chlorpyrifos daphnia magna 0 1 µg l 1 oncorhynchus mykiss 25 µg l 1 where the average concentrations occurring in surface irf in the days shortly following application were 1 9 and 33 9 µg l 1 however it should be noted that this study represents a worst case scenario in pesticide movement considering that samples were collected immediately after leaving each replicate bed therefore this serves as an indicator of relative risk to aquatic organisms between compounds investigated in this study with the remaining 7 9 pesticide concentrations varying in order of magnitudes below the eco toxicological thresholds in practice irf would likely be directed through several irf channels ditches prior to either on site collection or off site release as pesticide residues move in irf through such channels the potential for other degradative processes may further reduce concentration of these compounds while sedimentation of suspended solids bearing sorbed pesticides may limit movement majsztrik et al 2017 4 conclusions irrigating based on θ reduced the volume of water applied as well as the volume of irf for the oh reductions in the volume of water applied reduced the amount of irrigation to non target areas contributing to less irf the direct application of water to containers via ss allowed more precise irrigation applications eliminating non target access and oftentimes resulting in complete elimination of surface irf no differences were identified in subsurface irf volumes between the treatments and the control however the consistently greater volumes of surface irf from the control indicates that more efficient irrigation practices have a greater impact on surface return volume than subsurface irf volume pesticide mobility in surface and subsurface irf was reflective of each compounds physiochemical properties with more soluble pesticides capable of moving in both surface and subsurface irf while less soluble pesticides were typically only mobile in surface irf for all pesticides studied surface irf typically exported a greater amount of each pesticide a linear decrease in surface irf loads exported from the control was identified for all pesticides except oxyfluorfen thus indicating that reductions in surface irf volumes generated in the days immediately following pesticide applications reduce overall movement of pesticides through reducing pesticide movement compounds may degrade in situ irrigating via overhead using θ reduces water use and irf when compared to standard overhead irrigation practices whereas ss irrigation applies water directly to containers and often eliminates surface irf in general typically irrigating using ss will not generate surface irf only precipitation will furthermore the avoidance of applying irrigation to inter container spaces may maintain pesticides on the production surface where photolysis and volatilization rates may increase it was observed that a greater amount of applied pesticides were lost to irf from the high mobility group than the moderately and low mobility groups table 3 practical strategies to minimize pesticide movement is selecting pesticides possessing low solubilities high adsorption coefficients when possible however consideration should be given towards the potential eco toxicological risk of each compound as well regardless of pesticide physiochemical properties implementing irrigation practices that delay irrigation applications reduce irrigation volume and or provide water directly to crops containers are management practices that effectively limit pesticide movement particularly highly mobile compounds declaration of competing interest the
