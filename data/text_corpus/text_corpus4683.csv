23415,the sulfate deterioration of cement based materials has become severe durability problems for the offshore structures considering the various service conditions such as splash and tidal zone with without sulfate attack the behavior of mortar samples under full immersion and dry wetting cycles with 0 and 5 na2so4 solution i e four exposure conditions was investigated in this research compressive strength elastic modulus permeability water permeability coefficient expansion behavior and sem images were tested and analyzed the results showed that the behavior of mortar evolved in two stages initial improvement followed by later degradation determined by two competitive effects under each condition different deterioration mechanisms worked in the different exposure conditions we proposed binomial formulas to describe the evolutions of the compressive strength and water permeability and we further applied them in other researches well meanwhile there was a linear relationship between elastic modulus and square root of compressive strength furthermore the relation between water permeability and compressive strength was highly dependent on exposure types and time study showed that compressive strength and water permeability coefficient can be selected as controlling parameters in in situ tests and a possible approach to evaluate the sulfate deterioration level of concrete structures in situ was represented keywords mortar sulfate exposures water permeability compressive strength in situ test 1 introduction cement based materials have been widely applied in marine and offshore engineering say piers abutments and offshore turbines due to their good performance and low cost however the aggressive marine environment causes serious durability problems on them shortening the service life yu et al 2017 the detrimental ions in seawater like cl chloride ions so4 2 sulfate ions mg2 magnesium ions induced reinforcement corrosion and concrete deterioration glasser et al 2008 while the temperature and humidity changes in splash and tidal zones further aggravate the durability de medeiros junior et al 2015 compared with the indirect effect from chloride ions sulfate ions deteriorate the concrete directly through reacting with cement hydration products yin et al 2017 and it is an adverse environmental factor in the service of concrete structures second to reinforcement corrosion ghafoori et al 2015 according to the deterioration features in different exposure conditions there are chemical attack and physical attack in chemical sulfate attack sulfate ions penetrate into internal pores and react with cement hydration products to form expansive products ettringite gypsum or thaumasite leading expansion cracking softening and degradation of concrete whittaker and black 2015 in physical sulfate attack psa also termed as salt weathering humidity and temperature changes induce sulfate salt crystalline and pressures against pore wall causing surface scaling and flaking of concrete haynes et al 2008 in marine environment both attacks might happen simultaneously to concrete structures for instance the structure foundations sited in sulfate bearing ground and seawater suffer from the chemical sulfate attack under the water level whereas parts of them undergo physical sulfate attack from dry wetting cycles in splash and tidal zone yoshida et al 2010 thus it is essential to investigate the behavior of cement based material under different exposure conditions of sulfate attack for the sulfate deterioration assessment of structures serving in marine environment so far chemical sulfate attack in form of full immersion in sulfate solutions on cement based materials has been paid much attention experimental results reveal the expansion and degradation mechanism whittaker and black 2015 lothenbach et al 2010 rozière et al 2009 various affecting factors e g water cement ratio cement type sulfate types temperature ph on the deterioration process have been investigated santhanam et al 2002 wee et al 2000 monteiro and kurtis 2003 further diffusion chemo mechanical models considering sulfate ions diffusion chemical reactions and mechanical damages are established bary 2008 tixier and mobasher 2003 psa on concrete was often overlooked and received little attention until recent years haynes et al 1996 many long term field tests showed that the concrete foundation parts exposed to air were severely deteriorated and various efflorescence salts remained on the evaporating surface stark 1989 li et al 1995 in laboratory tests two exposure regimes are often applied one is partial immersion in sulfate solution with cyclic temperature and humidity condition haynes et al 2008 bassuoni and rahman 2016 nehdi et al 2014 aye and oguchi 2011 the other is full immersion in sulfate solution under dry wetting cycles sahmaran et al 2007 yuan et al 2016 currently the performance of concrete subjected different sulfate environments is receiving increasingly attention also the concrete resistances have been modified using fly ash silica fume blast furnace slag nanoparticles for those exposure conditions bassuoni and rahman 2016 nehdi et al 2014 nehdi and hayek 2005 jiang et al 2014 jiang and niu 2016 explored the effect of solution concentrations and sulfate types on the deterioration process of concrete subjected to dry wetting cycles in different sulfate solutions haynes et al 2008 submerged concrete samples partially in 5 na2so4 solutions with temperature and humidity cycles simulating 5 ambient exposures aye and oguchi 2011 investigated the resistance of cement mortar blended with pozzolans in 10 na2so4 mgso4 solutions under four exposure conditions including full immersion and partial immersion at constant temperature dry wetting cycles however the mentioned exposure conditions are always the coupled actions between sulfate immersion and dry wetting cycles the comparisons between individual effect of immersion and dry wetting cycling on the behavior of concrete is limited in literature in dry wetting process drying removes water in concrete and leads shrinkage and microcracks hansen 2010 though re wetting regains water some microstructural changes and microcracks in the previous drying are irreversible wu et al 2017 such effect should not be ignored in the coupled action in addition establishing the real sulfate deterioration level in site is a hot topic for scientists however few researches above concern the damage evaluation of concrete structures on spot it is essential to extend those experimental and modelling results to the practical assessment for deteriorated concrete the permeability of concrete controls the transport of aggressive ions water primarily affecting the structure durability in severe environments permeability has been suggested to be taken into account for mix design and quality control of concrete aldea et al 1999 nevertheless the evolutions of water permeability of concrete subjected to sulfate exposures are rarely reported hadjsadok et al 2012 in our study besides the mechanical properties compressive strength static elastic modulus expansion behavior and sem images the permeability water permeability coefficient of the deteriorated mortar susceptible matrix of concrete was tested and analyzed the samples were prepared under 4 different exposure conditions i e full immersion and dry wetting cycles in 0 and 5 na2so4 solutions up to 270 days the deterioration mechanisms and property evolutions were then discussed and described by binomial functions finally we proposed a possible solution to establish real sulfate deterioration level in situ 2 experimental procedure 2 1 materials and samples preparation the ordinary portland cement p o 42 5 supplied by anhui conch cement company china was used in this study the chemical compositions and the mineral compositions are presented in table 1 the iso standard sand complying with gb 178 1977 sac 2006 was used as fine aggregate its particle size distribution and physical properties are given in table 2 the mortar mixture was prepared with the water cement ratio of 1 2 and cement sand ratio of 1 3 the mixture proportion is shown in table 3 cylinders φ 50 mm 100 mm and prismatic bars 25 mm 25 mm 285 mm were prepared the mortar was prepared in cement mixer as follows 1 the cement and fine aggregates were premixed for 0 5 min 2 the entire amount of water was added and mixed for 1 min 3 after a pause for 1 min the mortar mixture was mixed against for 2 min 4 the fresh mortar was filled into the mold by three times 5 the fresh samples were compacted by a mechanical vibrating table for 2 3 min at a frequency of 50 hz and the vibration amplitude of 0 5 mm 6 after compacting the samples were cured at 23 c for 24 h in molds covered with polyethylene film to prevent moisture loss 7 after 1 day the samples were demolded and transferred to a standard curing box 20 2 c and 95 3 rh for 28 days according to astm c192 astm 2007 2 2 exposure conditions after the standard curing of 28 days the mortar samples were divided into 4 groups and subjected to 4 different exposure list in table 4 conditions up to 270 days the solutions were refreshed every 2 months there were various dry wetting cycles in the literature nehdi et al 2014 sahmaran et al 2007 wu et al 2017 the dry wetting cycles of this study were referred to gb t 50082 2009 sac 2010 a cabr lsb ⅱdry wetting machine designed in accordance with this code was used for dry wetting cycling it was equipped with two chambers one front chamber loaded with mortar specimens and the other back chamber stored solution in drying stage one dry wetting cycle 24 h consisting of inflowing immersion draining drying and cooling was set as presented in fig 1 2 3 mechanical test at the exposure durations of 0 30 60 90 120 150 180 210 240 270 days three replicate φ 50 mm 100 mm cylinder samples under each conditions were prepared for the uniaxial compression test on the test day specimens full immersed or under wet state of dry wetting cycles were taken out from solution and the surface of each specimen was thoroughly washed and wiped then the samples were dried at 60 c until a constant mass later cooled to room temperature before tests the uniaxial compression tests were performed in auto compensated and auto equilibrated triaxial cell system fig 2 of top industry france in this cell system there are three high pressure generators equipped for deviatoric stress σ1 σ3 load confining stress σ3 σ2 σ3 load and drainage stress load pin pout respectively in the uniaxial compression test σ2 σ3 0 the deviatoric stress generator with a maximum capacity of 375 mpa is used for axial stress load σ1 and the axial displacement of the mortar was measured with two linear variable displacement transducers lvdt placed at two opposite sides of the sample the compression test was conducted in the axial displacement control mode with the rate of 0 001 mm s the values of stress σ1 and strain ε1 in the total process were collected every 5 s until the sample reached fractured 2 4 water permeability test the auto compensated and auto equilibrated triaxial cell system was also used for the water permeability test of the mortar three cylindrical samples were taken out and prepared as above in mechanical test after the exposure for 0 30 60 90 120 150 180 210 240 270 days in this test the confining pressure was set to 5 mpa to prevent side leakage between the samples and membrane and then an initial water pressure of 2 mpa was applied to the surface of the sample for 24 h pin 2 mpa pout 0 mpa the total water volume

2004 after the standard curing of 28 days the initial length of the mortar bar was tested then the sample was full immersed or placed in the dry wetting circulation machine for further length measurement the length variation was monitored through a high accuracy digital length comparator the expansion of mortar was obtained according to equation 2 2 δ l l x l i l g 100 where δl is the length change of the mortar bar at x days l x is the length of the mortar bar at x days exposed to different conditions mm l i is the initial length of the mortar bar curing for 28 days mm l g is the nominal gage length or 250 mm as applicable the visual inspection of the mortar sample was conducted by taking the sample from the full immersion solution or dry wetting circulation machine at the given exposure durations of 90 and 270 days all the changes on the surface of the mortar specimen i e surface color expansion spalling and delamination were thoroughly checked and recorded 2 6 sem analysis the microstructure of the deteriorated mortar was evaluated by scanning electron microscopy sem an fe sem s 4800 with an accelerating voltage of 0 5 30 kv and 25 800 000 magnification was used in this research the deteriorated cylinder mortar at 270 days was cut into several portions using diamond wire cutting machine switzerland well 6234 4 portions of sample were obtained and dried at 60 c the selected sample portion was then fixed on copper stubs using carbon paste polished and coated by evaporation with gold 3 results and discussion 3 1 compressive strength the evolution of compressive strength of mortar subjected to four exposure conditions are illustrated in fig 3 and it exhibits two distinct stages an initial increase stage and a decrease stage followed exposure 1 in 0 na2so4 solution tap water the compressive strength increased before early 120 days and then the growth rate slowed down even reduced slightly at later stage the further hydration of cement particles refined the microstructure and enhanced the compressive strength at early stage later the increase rate reduced and the compressive strength kept around 39 mpa furthermore the strength slightly reduced after 240 days two reasons may be given to this phenomenon one is that the value at 270 days fell in the margin of errors of the test considering the standard deviations are 2 03 at 240 days and 1 92 at 270 days it is possible that the value may remain stable at 270 days the other is leaching in which the concentration differences between pore solution and water caused reduction of calcium ions then led to a dissolution of the portlandite ch and calcium silica hydrates c s h jain and neithalath 2009 eventually triggering the loss of strength torrenti et al 2013 exposure 2 the cyclic effect caused an accelerating and greater variation in compressive strength of mortar water evaporated from mortar in drying capillary pressure and moisture gradient generated the capillary pressure acted like a prestressing to strenghten the mortar bartlett and macgregor 1994 okajima et al 1980 moisture gradient induced the differential contraction between external and internal parts of the sample not only confined the internal part but led to microcracking wu et al 2017 baǎnt and raftshol 1982 later on re wetting the loss of water and microcracking partially recovered wu et al 2017 sakata 1983 leaving residual drying effect after one cycle before 180 cycles prestressing in the residual drying and hydration took dominant and increased the compressive strenght from 28 8 mpa to 40 9 mpa afterwards the accumulative microcracing became preponderant and declined the strength to 38 0 mpa exposure 3 as expected sulfate immersion caused more severe deterioration this agreed with other research results and can be attributed to the chemical reaction between sulfate ions and hydration products lothenbach et al 2010 çavdar and yetgin 2010 zhou et al 2016 at first gypsum and ettringite the primary reaction products filled the pores and compacted the microstructure resulting in the compressive strength increment then they exceeded the pore limitation and expansive stress sprouted once the stress outstripped the tensile strength of mortar microcracking developed and deteriorated the strength also leaching and consumption of hydration products further weakened the cohesion it is noteworthy that the compressive strength of sample full immersed in 5 na2so4 solution had more significant changes than that under drying wetting cycle without sulfates exposure 2 the mortar gained 40 6 strength increase within 150 days shorter than that in exposure 2 also it lost 25 3 strength at the end of immersion more than the reduction in dry wetting cycles lee et al 2008 reported around 18 2 and 26 8 decrease in compressive strength of mortar immersed in 5 na2so4 solution for 240 days and 360 days brown 1981 found a nearly 40 0 decrease in strength for mortar after 84 days immersion in a similar exposure exposure 4 under sulfate immersion and dry wetting cycles the dual sulfate attack physical and chemical sulfate attack deteriorated the samples more seriously compared with chemical sulfate attack of exposure 3 under the residual drying effect and positive effect of expansive products the compressive strength grew sharply to 40 6 mpa from 0 day to 90 days subsequently it dropped to 28 3 mpa at 270 days much less than that under other three conditions it may be due to the fact that the drying process created super saturation of sodium sulfate which exerted high tensile stress against the pore walls and generate microcracks in wetting those microcracks along with capillary absorption gained more sulfates into mortar which further accelerated the chemical reaction and physical crystallization sahmaran et al 2007 yuan et al 2016 moreover the scheduled cycling in this study was suitable for the conversion of anhydrous sodium sulfate thenardite na2so4 to hydrous one mirabilite na2so4 10h2o involved with a 315 volumetric change haynes et al 2008 bassuoni and rahman 2016 such cyclic changes accompanied by crystallization and chemical reaction aggravated the compressive strength based on the results above a binomial function was proposed to describe the relationships between compressive strength and exposure time for 4 different conditions as eq 3 3 f t f 0 a t 2 b t 1 where f t and f 0 are uniaxial compressive strength of mortar subjected to each exposure condition at t days and 0 day respectively and the fitting parameters corresponding to the exposure condition were listed in table 5 fig 4 a b show that these proposed empirical formulas had good fitting performance considering that 2 a t b controlled the evolution rate of compressive strength with exposure time the parameter a of 2 a t b played the primary role in the strength deterioration process neglecting the influence of parameter b δ a 2 a 2 a 1 δ a 3 a 3 a 1 δ a 4 a 4 a 1 can be considered as the main effect of dry wetting cycle chemical sulfate attack and dual attack and they are 0 454 10 5 0 985 10 5 and 1 455 10 5 respectively the sum of δ a 2 and δ a 3 is less than δ a 4 indicating that the dual attack physical and chemical sulfate attack on mortar was more severe than the superposition of dry wetting cyclic attack and chemical sulfate attack note that the specific parameters are unique to the mixture proportion and exposure regime of this study to prove the applicability of the function form proposed some compressive strength data of other researches are listed in table 6 with some detailed information also the good fitting results are presented in fig 5 it is conceivable that our empirical equations can be extended to practical application 3 2 elastic modulus from fig 6 it can be observed that elastic modulus under different exposure tests increases in early exposure period and decreases in later period which are similar with the trend of compressive strength due to continuous hydration the elastic modulus of mortar subjected to exposure 1 increased from 14 6 gpa to 17 2 gpa and then the increment slowed down and just gained 4 1 increase between 120 days and 240 days it even dropped to 17 4 gpa at 270 days which can be attributed to either the standard deviation or the effect of leaching and decalcification of hydration products zhu et al 2013 studied the dynamic elastic modulus of mortar immersed in 0 na2so4 and found the value dropped after 330 days under the residual drying effect of dry wetting cycles in exposure 2 the mortar took shorter time 180 days to the peak value of elastic modulus later the damage of accumulative microcracking overrode the positive residual drying effect and the elastic modulus declined from 18 0 gpa to 16 1 gpa when being exposed to sulfate solution exposure 3 exposure 4 the elastic modulus of samples improved with the progress of immersion or dry wetting cycles until certain days 150 days 90 days subsequently the severe sulfate deterioration decreased the elastic modulus by 16 2 and 20 9 in addition the action of dry wetting cycles of exposure 4 triggered physical sulfate attack in the form of crystalline pressure and volumetric expansion the joint effect of physical and chemical damage shortened the time to the peak value of elastic modulus and sped up the decrease rate in later stage moreover as represented in fig 7 there was a significant correlation between the elastic modulus and the square root of compressive strength of mortar under each exposure condition the damage process had trivial effect on the correlation between the compressive strength and elastic modulus this is also proved by zhou et al 2016 various ranges of coarse and fine aggregates induce diverse compressive strengths and elastic moduli of cement based materials however since those aggregates are made of silica particles and the ingredients of normal concrete and mortar are similar the intrinsic relation between compressive strength and elastic modulus of concrete may be applied to that of mortar analogy to the equation suggested for normal weight concrete aci 2005 the elastic modulus of mortar can be determined by the following eq 4 with r square of 0 960 the result of concrete under sulfate attack with dry wetting cycles zhou et al 2016 can also be described by a similar equation eq 5 with r2 0 940 shown in fig 8 4 e 3 4 f 4 12 5 e 5 8 f 16 67 where e and f are elastic modulus and uniaxial compressive strength respectively even they are of different proportion and exposed to different exposure conditions the sulfate attack does not change the intrinsic relationship between compressive strength and elastic modulus thus it may be reasonable to evaluate the mechanical properties of mortar in different environment via either of the two indicators in field test 3 3 water permeability coefficient since the deterioration starts with the harmful ions transportation by water the transport property e g permeability is critical in the durability of mortar under aggressive conditions fig 9 depicts the logarithm of water permeability coefficient of mortar versus exposure days under different exposure conditions in exposure 1 the logarithm of water permeability coefficient decreased with immersion time the continuous water curing gradually refined the microstructure and decreased the internal flow channel later a lower decrease rate of permeability was observed due to the less hydration after 240 days for specimens in exposure 2 the dry wetting action led to a two staged evolution of water permeability the permeability coefficient decreased from 2 03 10 12 m s to 0 31 10 12 m s during the first period of 150 days then it increased rapidly by 341 9 from 150 days to 270 days indicating that microcracking held dominance in later stage of dry wetting cycle cracks appeared in the microstructure presented in sem analysis also proved it the full immersion in 5 na2so4 solution exposure 3 decreased the permeability coefficient from 2 07 10 12 m s to 0 38 10 12 m s after 150 days exposure the hydration products and expansive reaction products gradually filled the pores of mortar and reduced their connection later microcracking induced by expansion interconnected flow paths and increased permeability to 1 52 10 12 m s at 270 days comparatively the turning point of water permeability coefficient in exposure 3 happened at the same time with that in exposure 2 but that point of compressive strength and elastic modulus in exposure 3 happened earlier than that in exposure 2 it on one hand confirmed the water permeability was more sensitive to deterioration on the other may indicate that sulfate reaction products blocked pore and microcracks decreasing the connectivity to the mortar subjected to exposure 4 permeability experienced more dramatic variation the magnitude of which can vary largely from 10 13 to 10 11 within 90 cycles the filling effect of sulfate crystalline and chemical reaction products decreased the water permeability of mortar and the minimum value of 0 32 10 12 m s reached since the dry wetting regime includes drying at 80 c and wetting at 20 c in which the sodium sulfate is in anhydrous state thenardite for the drying and transformed to hydrous state mirabilite in the later wetting flatt 2002 with the cycles excessive crystalline pressure expansion pressure and repetitive conversion from thenardite to mirabilite caused massive microcrack initiation haynes et al 2008 bassuoni and rahman 2016 those cracks allowed more sulfates to infiltrate into the mortar facilitating deterioration and cracks such chain reaction contributed to the enormous growth in water permeability from 0 32 10 12 m s to 27 0 10 12 m s from above results the evolution of water permeability coefficient is more sensitive than the mechanical properties of deteriorated samples and can be a good indicator to evaluate the mortar durability under deterioration process the compressive strength is determined by the cohesion between the cement paste and aggregates also relevant with the microcracks and porosity while the permeability is highly dependent on the pore continuity and cracks of the microstructures bamforth 1991 moreover our paper proposed similar empirical formulas eq 6 with that for compressive strength to simulate the variation of logarithm of water permeability coefficient in the 4 exposure tests note that the following equations and parameters were derived from our study 6 lg k t lg k 0 p t 2 q t 1 where k t and k 0 are the water permeability coefficient of mortar under exposure for t days and 0 day the fitting parameters of four exposure conditions are presented in table 7 and the fitting effects are depicted in fig 10 there are good agreement between those experiment data and present fitting results those functions not only revealed the effect of each exposure condition on the water permeability coefficient of mortar but conformed to the conclusion obtained in compressive strength similar with the compressive strength when neglecting the influence of parameter q δ p 2 p 2 p 1 δ p 3 p 3 p 1 δ p 4 p 4 p 1 are 2 199 10 6 2 149 10 6 and 5 259 10 6 mainly representing the effect of exposure 2 3 and 4 it is noteworthy that δ p 4 is larger than the sum of δ p 2 and δ p 3 which confirmed the above conclusion that dry wetting cycle with sulfate caused severe physical sulfate attack on mortar besides the chemical sulfate attack and the accumulative dry wetting effect differently the parameter values of water permeability coefficient in exposure 2 were nearly the same with that in exposure 3 indicating that samples under that two conditions experienced similar damage it further supported that the water permeability coefficient was sensitive to microcracking which was the dominant deterioration factor in exposure 2 in the water permeability coefficient the deterioration degree of 4 exposure conditions was in the order of exposure 4 exposure 3 exposure 2 exposure 1 3 4 expansion the length changes of mortar bars exposed to 4 conditions are illustrated in fig 11 the dashed line represents the expansion limit of 0 10 at 26 weeks 182 days which is classified as moderate sulfate resistance as required by astm c1012 astm 2004 the corresponding surface deterioration of mortar samples for 90 and 270 days are also shown respectively in table 8 in exposure 1 mortar bars were emerged into water without water loss which prevented from drying shrinkage the expansion had a slight increase during the early period and then kept stable the surface of mortar had no remarkable change and remained smooth during the whole immersion by comparison for mortar under dry wetting cycle with water exposure 2 shrinkage took place at first and then the length turned stable drying in one cycle vaporized the surface water exerting prestress to contract the volume of sample meanwhile shrinkage was alleviated to some extents due to the subsequent re immersion the residual drying effect made the length slightly decrease to 0 01 after 78 cycles the surface turned whiter after 90 cycles with the cycles going on the contraction was mitigated in the effect of microcracking and the length remained unchanged the initial surface defects also enlarged in the sample surface as shown in table 8 the mortar bar in exposure 3 showed the two staged evolution of expansion which agreed with other studies rozière et al 2009 santhanam et al 2002 during the first 22 days the expansion of the mortar bar was insignificant which was often termed as induction stage after that the mortar started to expand and an accelerating expansion appears after 212 days immersion the dark erosion pits spalling and white powdery material started to appear on the surface after 90 days wider and thicker white powdery material precipitated larger and more erosion pits with spalling and delamination can be inspected at the end of immersion it is conceivable that sulfate ions diffused through the surface pores from outside to inside and the contents near the surface was relatively higher thus the surface pores were inclined to be erosion pits and spalling though being washed the white salt deposited can be observed owing to the high concentrations of sulfates in the pores near surface mortar subjected to exposure 4 suffered most severe expansion at early stage the filling process occurred and led trivial expansion then dry wetting cycle not only induced physical sulfate attack but promoted chemical sulfate attack 1 44 expansion is thus generated in later stage the erosion pits and white powdery material emerged excessively on the surface followed by progressive spalling and delamination this phenomenon was also observed in previous study haynes et al 2008 bassuoni and rahman 2016 nehdi et al 2014 the temperature relative humidity cycling can induce abundant white precipitated substances the combination of hydrated and unhydrated forms of na2so4 efflorescence haynes et al 2008 bassuoni and rahman 2016 the coupled effect of physical and chemical process further amplified other deterioration signs compared with single chemical attack 3 5 sem analysis fig 12 a d show sem micromorphology of mortar subjected to 4 exposure conditions for 270 days respectively in fig 12 a clusters of spinulose c s h crystals and thin hexagonal flake calcium hydroxide crystals can be observed also they were in tight connection representing compact internal microstructure of mortar this can well explain the improved mechanical properties and reduced water permeability of mortar full immersed in water in the effect of 270 dry wetting cycles cracks appeared with some white flocculent substances near the crack edge in fig 12 b the repetitive dry wetting action led to microcrack development which is the channel for leaching it is conceivable that the leaching of calcium hydroxide ca oh 2 caused the decalcification of c s h gels in the form of white substances near the cracks for the mortar immersed in 5 na2so4 solution there was a large amount of needle like ettringite randomly oriented on the surface of the selected mortar portion with loose flocculent c s h crystals nehdi and hayek 2005 ye et al 2014 growth of the columnar or tabulate gypsum and consumption of ca oh 2 were also found ye et al 2014 these expansive reaction products were responsible for the sudden expansion of mortar in the later stage cracks caused by the expansive products nearby can also be detected the loose microstructure was the main reason for the deterioration of mechanical property and increase of permeability when exposed to exposure 4 the mortar portion surface was covered with mass of rod like sodium sulfate crystals which were mainly the combinations of thenardite and mirabilite in the action of dry wetting cycle with sodium sulfate nehdi and hayek 2005 beside the physical sulfate crystalline the white acicular ettringite and columnar and sheet gypsum can be observed both physical and chemical deterioration triggered the cracks but the large amount of physical sulfate crystals was believed to be the leading deterioration factor in the exposure 4 haynes et al 2008 bassuoni and rahman 2016 nehdi et al 2014 3 6 application in in situ tests evaluating the behavior of concrete in situ has become a hot topic for engineering structure assessment and maintenance since mechanical property and durability are two main aspects in concrete structures it is worthwhile to determine the relationship between permeability and mechanical property of deteriorated concrete for a more comprehensive damage assessment though the proportion of concrete in situ is different from that of mortar in laboratory both of them are cement based materials santhanam et al 2002 concluded that the pattern of deterioration and the type of reaction products formed were similar in most of the cementitious mortar systems as the main matrix of concrete mortar is susceptible to sulfate attack the applicability of the empirical formulas for compressive strength has been verified by other types of mortar and concrete above it is reasonable to investigate the water permeability coefficient compressive strength relationships of mortar under different exposure conditions as shown in fig 13 the exposure can be categorized into two types one is immersion with only one phase the other is dry wetting cycling with two phases in immersion type the relationship between water permeability and compressive strength of mortar in early stage approximately equals to that in later stage defined as phase 1 one of the two indexes can be used in the practical assessment in dry wetting cycling type such relationship in first stage differed from that in second stage of exposure it can be explained by that the compressive strength was not as sensitive as permeability to microcracking the dry wetting cycling contributed to the burst of microcracking especially in the later stage thus the variation of permeability was more dramatic than the compressive strength not consistent with that in first stage both of the two properties should be detected for assessment in situ in phase 2 deterioration stage there are three main influential factors to the variations of the relations between water permeability and compressive strength immersion 0 and 5 na2so4 and dry wetting cycles the relationship between them with good fitting is depicted in fig 14 phase 1 of exposure 1 and 2 can be described a linear relation in which the effect of dry wetting cycling of exposure 2 is ignored since the sulfate reaction products initially compact the pores and improve the performance of mortar the variation is expected to be more significant in phase 1 as for phase 2 the dominate factor is dry wetting cycling the effect of sulfate immersion is minor hence it can be concluded that the logarithm of water permeability coefficient were related to the compressive strength of mortar subjected to different exposure but in some case the exposure types and phases needed to be considered based on the above experimental analysis a possible approach to evaluate the sulfate deterioration level in situ for concrete structures was proposed as follows 1 obtain the referential evolution of compressive strength and water permeability coefficient firstly choose the specific types from the exposure 1 4 through the sulfate concentration with without dry wetting cycle on spot then prepare laboratory samples referred to mixture proportions of the concrete structure put them into the specific exposures and conduct mechanical tests and water permeability tests the two indexes are presented as that in figs 3 and 9 2 determine the evaluated property investigate the relationship between compressive strength and water permeability coefficient as shown in figs 13 and 14 if there is only one phase in the exposure i e immersion type any one of the both indexes can be assessed in concrete structures otherwise both of strength and permeability of concrete are recommend detecting in practical assessment 3 judge the deterioration stage of concrete structure firstly detect the compressive strength or and water permeability coefficient of concrete in situ regularly every half a year the tests can be conducted on the drill core samples from the structure or through non destructive methods on selected parts like rebound methods huang et al 2011 qasrawi 2000 and autoclam system basheer 1994 yang et al 2013 and then compare the data on spot to the laboratory referential curves in step 1 to judge if this structures in deterioration stage 4 predict the performance of the structure in the future the empirical functions of the data in laboratory like eq 3 and eq 6 are proposed according to those field data the deterioration process of the structure can be predicted eventually on the basis of the deterioration level judgement and prediction proper measures for structure maintenance can be drawn up 4 conclusion considering the effect of sulfate attack and dry wetting cycles on the offshore structures in marine environment the behavior and associated deterioration mechanism of mortar subjected to four conditions full immersion and dry wetting cycles in 0 and 5 na2so4 solutions were investigated the compressive strength elastic modulus water permeability coefficient of mortar and the relations between them were analyzed also expansion visual inspection and sem analysis were conducted the following conclusions were obtained from experimental results 1 mortar samples in each exposure condition generally exhibited two staged evolution the improvement at first stage and deterioration at later stage but the process evolved differently corresponding to exposure conditions continuous hydration and slow leaching were responsible for the mortar full immersed in 0 na2so4 solution exposure 1 residual drying effect firstly dominated but then overrode by the accumulative microcracking in the process of dry wetting cycle with water exposure 2 chemical sulfate reaction took place in the mortar immersed in 5 na2so4 solution exposure 3 the expansive products gypsum and ettringite at first filled the internal pores later exceeded accommodation capacity and induced microcracking the dry wetting cycles with sulfate exposure 4 brought physical sulfate attack besides chemical one salt growth pressures and repetitive conversion between anhydrous and hydrous form of na2so4 promoted severe deterioration on mortar 2 the evolution of compressive strength and water permeability coefficient of damaged mortar can be well described by binomial functions the function form was also suitable for other researches the linear relationship between elastic modulus and square root of compressive strength was not affected by exposure conditions 3 the effect of exposure 4 to the mortar was more severe than the superstition of exposure 2 and 3 more interestingly the compressive strength variation in exposure 3 was higher than that subjected to dry wetting cycles with water exposure 2 while water permeability exhibited different trend i e exposure 2 and 3 caused similar damage to the mortar 4 the relation between the water permeability coefficient and compressive strength was highly dependent on the sulfate exposure types and time for the sake of practicality and accuracy a possible solution to the in situ concrete assessment under different exposure conditions was established acknowledgements this project was supported by national natural science foundation of china 51579088 51779087 natural science foundation of jiangsu province bk20150037 bk20150811 bk20161507 and the 111 project b12032 
23415,the sulfate deterioration of cement based materials has become severe durability problems for the offshore structures considering the various service conditions such as splash and tidal zone with without sulfate attack the behavior of mortar samples under full immersion and dry wetting cycles with 0 and 5 na2so4 solution i e four exposure conditions was investigated in this research compressive strength elastic modulus permeability water permeability coefficient expansion behavior and sem images were tested and analyzed the results showed that the behavior of mortar evolved in two stages initial improvement followed by later degradation determined by two competitive effects under each condition different deterioration mechanisms worked in the different exposure conditions we proposed binomial formulas to describe the evolutions of the compressive strength and water permeability and we further applied them in other researches well meanwhile there was a linear relationship between elastic modulus and square root of compressive strength furthermore the relation between water permeability and compressive strength was highly dependent on exposure types and time study showed that compressive strength and water permeability coefficient can be selected as controlling parameters in in situ tests and a possible approach to evaluate the sulfate deterioration level of concrete structures in situ was represented keywords mortar sulfate exposures water permeability compressive strength in situ test 1 introduction cement based materials have been widely applied in marine and offshore engineering say piers abutments and offshore turbines due to their good performance and low cost however the aggressive marine environment causes serious durability problems on them shortening the service life yu et al 2017 the detrimental ions in seawater like cl chloride ions so4 2 sulfate ions mg2 magnesium ions induced reinforcement corrosion and concrete deterioration glasser et al 2008 while the temperature and humidity changes in splash and tidal zones further aggravate the durability de medeiros junior et al 2015 compared with the indirect effect from chloride ions sulfate ions deteriorate the concrete directly through reacting with cement hydration products yin et al 2017 and it is an adverse environmental factor in the service of concrete structures second to reinforcement corrosion ghafoori et al 2015 according to the deterioration features in different exposure conditions there are chemical attack and physical attack in chemical sulfate attack sulfate ions penetrate into internal pores and react with cement hydration products to form expansive products ettringite gypsum or thaumasite leading expansion cracking softening and degradation of concrete whittaker and black 2015 in physical sulfate attack psa also termed as salt weathering humidity and temperature changes induce sulfate salt crystalline and pressures against pore wall causing surface scaling and flaking of concrete haynes et al 2008 in marine environment both attacks might happen simultaneously to concrete structures for instance the structure foundations sited in sulfate bearing ground and seawater suffer from the chemical sulfate attack under the water level whereas parts of them undergo physical sulfate attack from dry wetting cycles in splash and tidal zone yoshida et al 2010 thus it is essential to investigate the behavior of cement based material under different exposure conditions of sulfate attack for the sulfate deterioration assessment of structures serving in marine environment so far chemical sulfate attack in form of full immersion in sulfate solutions on cement based materials has been paid much attention experimental results reveal the expansion and degradation mechanism whittaker and black 2015 lothenbach et al 2010 rozière et al 2009 various affecting factors e g water cement ratio cement type sulfate types temperature ph on the deterioration process have been investigated santhanam et al 2002 wee et al 2000 monteiro and kurtis 2003 further diffusion chemo mechanical models considering sulfate ions diffusion chemical reactions and mechanical damages are established bary 2008 tixier and mobasher 2003 psa on concrete was often overlooked and received little attention until recent years haynes et al 1996 many long term field tests showed that the concrete foundation parts exposed to air were severely deteriorated and various efflorescence salts remained on the evaporating surface stark 1989 li et al 1995 in laboratory tests two exposure regimes are often applied one is partial immersion in sulfate solution with cyclic temperature and humidity condition haynes et al 2008 bassuoni and rahman 2016 nehdi et al 2014 aye and oguchi 2011 the other is full immersion in sulfate solution under dry wetting cycles sahmaran et al 2007 yuan et al 2016 currently the performance of concrete subjected different sulfate environments is receiving increasingly attention also the concrete resistances have been modified using fly ash silica fume blast furnace slag nanoparticles for those exposure conditions bassuoni and rahman 2016 nehdi et al 2014 nehdi and hayek 2005 jiang et al 2014 jiang and niu 2016 explored the effect of solution concentrations and sulfate types on the deterioration process of concrete subjected to dry wetting cycles in different sulfate solutions haynes et al 2008 submerged concrete samples partially in 5 na2so4 solutions with temperature and humidity cycles simulating 5 ambient exposures aye and oguchi 2011 investigated the resistance of cement mortar blended with pozzolans in 10 na2so4 mgso4 solutions under four exposure conditions including full immersion and partial immersion at constant temperature dry wetting cycles however the mentioned exposure conditions are always the coupled actions between sulfate immersion and dry wetting cycles the comparisons between individual effect of immersion and dry wetting cycling on the behavior of concrete is limited in literature in dry wetting process drying removes water in concrete and leads shrinkage and microcracks hansen 2010 though re wetting regains water some microstructural changes and microcracks in the previous drying are irreversible wu et al 2017 such effect should not be ignored in the coupled action in addition establishing the real sulfate deterioration level in site is a hot topic for scientists however few researches above concern the damage evaluation of concrete structures on spot it is essential to extend those experimental and modelling results to the practical assessment for deteriorated concrete the permeability of concrete controls the transport of aggressive ions water primarily affecting the structure durability in severe environments permeability has been suggested to be taken into account for mix design and quality control of concrete aldea et al 1999 nevertheless the evolutions of water permeability of concrete subjected to sulfate exposures are rarely reported hadjsadok et al 2012 in our study besides the mechanical properties compressive strength static elastic modulus expansion behavior and sem images the permeability water permeability coefficient of the deteriorated mortar susceptible matrix of concrete was tested and analyzed the samples were prepared under 4 different exposure conditions i e full immersion and dry wetting cycles in 0 and 5 na2so4 solutions up to 270 days the deterioration mechanisms and property evolutions were then discussed and described by binomial functions finally we proposed a possible solution to establish real sulfate deterioration level in situ 2 experimental procedure 2 1 materials and samples preparation the ordinary portland cement p o 42 5 supplied by anhui conch cement company china was used in this study the chemical compositions and the mineral compositions are presented in table 1 the iso standard sand complying with gb 178 1977 sac 2006 was used as fine aggregate its particle size distribution and physical properties are given in table 2 the mortar mixture was

mortar was prepared in cement mixer as follows 1 the cement and fine aggregates were premixed for 0 5 min 2 the entire amount of water was added and mixed for 1 min 3 after a pause for 1 min the mortar mixture was mixed against for 2 min 4 the fresh mortar was filled into the mold by three times 5 the fresh samples were compacted by a mechanical vibrating table for 2 3 min at a frequency of 50 hz and the vibration amplitude of 0 5 mm 6 after compacting the samples were cured at 23 c for 24 h in molds covered with polyethylene film to prevent moisture loss 7 after 1 day the samples were demolded and transferred to a standard curing box 20 2 c and 95 3 rh for 28 days according to astm c192 astm 2007 2 2 exposure conditions after the standard curing of 28 days the mortar samples were divided into 4 groups and subjected to 4 different exposure list in table 4 conditions up to 270 days the solutions were refreshed every 2 months there were various dry wetting cycles in the literature nehdi et al 2014 sahmaran et al 2007 wu et al 2017 the dry wetting cycles of this study were referred to gb t 50082 2009 sac 2010 a cabr lsb ⅱdry wetting machine designed in accordance with this code was used for dry wetting cycling it was equipped with two chambers one front chamber loaded with mortar specimens and the other back chamber stored solution in drying stage one dry wetting cycle 24 h consisting of inflowing immersion draining drying and cooling was set as presented in fig 1 2 3 mechanical test at the exposure durations of 0 30 60 90 120 150 180 210 240 270 days three replicate φ 50 mm 100 mm cylinder samples under each conditions were prepared for the uniaxial compression test on the test day specimens full immersed or under wet state of dry wetting cycles were taken out from solution and the surface of each specimen was thoroughly washed and wiped then the samples were dried at 60 c until a constant mass later cooled to room temperature before tests the uniaxial compression tests were performed in auto compensated and auto equilibrated triaxial cell system fig 2 of top industry france in this cell system there are three high pressure generators equipped for deviatoric stress σ1 σ3 load confining stress σ3 σ2 σ3 load and drainage stress load pin pout respectively in the uniaxial compression test σ2 σ3 0 the deviatoric stress generator with a maximum capacity of 375 mpa is used for axial stress load σ1 and the axial displacement of the mortar was measured with two linear variable displacement transducers lvdt placed at two opposite sides of the sample the compression test was conducted in the axial displacement control mode with the rate of 0 001 mm s the values of stress σ1 and strain ε1 in the total process were collected every 5 s until the sample reached fractured 2 4 water permeability test the auto compensated and auto equilibrated triaxial cell system was also used for the water permeability test of the mortar three cylindrical samples were taken out and prepared as above in mechanical test after the exposure for 0 30 60 90 120 150 180 210 240 270 days in this test the confining pressure was set to 5 mpa to prevent side leakage between the samples and membrane and then an initial water pressure of 2 mpa was applied to the surface of the sample for 24 h pin 2 mpa pout 0 mpa the total water volume

the acceleration of gravity m s2 2 5 expansion test twelve 25 mm 25 mm 285 mm prism bar subjected to 4 different exposure conditions were used for the expansion test as described by astm c 1012 astm 2004 after the standard curing of 28 days the initial length of the mortar bar was tested then the sample was full immersed or placed in the dry wetting circulation machine for further length measurement the length variation was monitored through a high accuracy digital length comparator the expansion of mortar was obtained according to equation 2 2 δ l l x l i l g 100 where δl is the length change of the mortar bar at x days l x is the length of the mortar bar at x days exposed to different conditions mm l i is the initial length of the mortar bar curing for 28 days mm l g is the nominal gage length or 250 mm as applicable the visual inspection of the mortar sample was conducted by taking the sample from the full immersion solution or dry wetting circulation machine at the given exposure durations of 90 and 270 days all the changes on the surface of the mortar specimen i e surface color expansion spalling and delamination were thoroughly checked and recorded 2 6 sem analysis the microstructure of the deteriorated mortar was evaluated by scanning electron microscopy sem an fe sem s 4800 with an accelerating voltage of 0 5 30 kv and 25 800 000 magnification was used in this research the deteriorated cylinder mortar at 270 days was cut into several portions using diamond wire cutting machine switzerland well 6234 4 portions of sample were obtained and dried at 60 c the selected sample portion was then fixed on copper stubs using carbon paste polished and coated by evaporation with gold 3 results and discussion 3 1 compressive strength the evolution of compressive strength of mortar subjected to four exposure conditions are illustrated in fig 3 and it exhibits two distinct stages an initial increase stage and a decrease stage followed exposure 1 in 0 na2so4 solution tap water the compressive strength increased before early 120 days and then the growth rate slowed down even reduced slightly at later stage the further hydration of cement particles refined the microstructure and enhanced the compressive strength at early stage later the increase rate reduced and the compressive strength kept around 39 mpa furthermore the strength slightly reduced after 240 days two reasons may be given to this phenomenon one is that the value at 270 days fell in the margin of errors of the test considering the standard deviations are 2 03 at 240 days and 1 92 at 270 days it is possible that the value may remain stable at 270 days the other is leaching in which the concentration differences between pore solution and water caused reduction of calcium ions then led to a dissolution of the portlandite ch and calcium silica hydrates c s h jain and neithalath 2009 eventually triggering the loss of strength torrenti et al 2013 exposure 2 the cyclic effect caused an accelerating and greater variation in compressive strength of mortar water evaporated from mortar in drying capillary pressure and moisture gradient generated the capillary pressure acted like a prestressing to strenghten the mortar bartlett and macgregor 1994 okajima et al 1980 moisture gradient induced the differential contraction between external and internal parts of the sample not only confined the internal part but led to microcracking wu et al 2017 baǎnt and raftshol 1982 later on re wetting the loss of water and microcracking partially recovered wu et al 2017 sakata 1983 leaving residual drying effect after one cycle before 180 cycles prestressing in the residual drying and hydration took dominant and increased the compressive strenght from 28 8 mpa to 40 9 mpa afterwards the accumulative microcracing became preponderant and declined the strength to 38 0 mpa exposure 3 as expected sulfate immersion caused more severe deterioration this agreed with other research results and can be attributed to the chemical reaction between sulfate ions and hydration products lothenbach et al 2010 çavdar and yetgin 2010 zhou et al 2016 at first gypsum and ettringite the primary reaction products filled the pores and compacted the microstructure resulting in the compressive strength increment then they exceeded the pore limitation and expansive stress sprouted once the stress outstripped the tensile strength of mortar microcracking developed and deteriorated the strength also leaching and consumption of hydration products further weakened the cohesion it is noteworthy that the compressive strength of sample full immersed in 5 na2so4 solution had more significant changes than that under drying wetting cycle without sulfates exposure 2 the mortar gained 40 6 strength increase within 150 days shorter than that in exposure 2 also it lost 25 3 strength at the end of immersion more than the reduction in dry wetting cycles lee et al 2008 reported around 18 2 and 26 8 decrease in compressive strength of mortar immersed in 5 na2so4 solution for 240 days and 360 days brown 1981 found a nearly 40 0 decrease in strength for mortar after 84 days immersion in a similar exposure exposure 4 under sulfate immersion and dry wetting cycles the dual sulfate attack physical and chemical sulfate attack deteriorated the samples more seriously compared with chemical sulfate attack of exposure 3 under the residual drying effect and positive effect of expansive products the compressive strength grew sharply to 40 6 mpa from 0 day to 90 days subsequently it dropped to 28 3 mpa at 270 days much less than that under other three conditions it may be due to the fact that the drying process created super saturation of sodium sulfate which exerted high tensile stress against the pore walls and generate microcracks in wetting those microcracks along with capillary absorption gained more sulfates into mortar which further accelerated the chemical reaction and physical crystallization sahmaran et al 2007 yuan et al 2016 moreover the scheduled cycling in this study was suitable for the conversion of anhydrous sodium sulfate thenardite na2so4 to hydrous one mirabilite na2so4 10h2o involved with a 315 volumetric change haynes et al 2008 bassuoni and rahman 2016 such cyclic changes accompanied by crystallization and chemical reaction aggravated the compressive strength based on the results above a binomial function was proposed to describe the relationships between compressive strength and exposure time for 4 different conditions as eq 3 3 f t f 0 a t 2 b t 1 where f t and f 0 are uniaxial compressive strength of mortar subjected to each exposure condition at t days and 0 day respectively and the fitting parameters corresponding to the exposure condition were listed in table 5 fig 4 a b show that these proposed empirical formulas had good fitting performance considering that 2 a t b controlled the evolution rate of compressive strength with exposure time the parameter a of 2 a t b played the primary role in the strength deterioration process neglecting the influence of parameter b δ a 2 a 2 a 1 δ a 3 a 3 a 1 δ a 4 a 4 a 1 can be considered as the main effect of dry wetting cycle chemical sulfate attack and dual attack and they are 0 454 10 5 0 985 10 5 and 1 455 10 5 respectively the sum of δ a 2 and δ a 3 is less than δ a 4 indicating that the dual attack physical and chemical sulfate attack on mortar was more severe than the superposition of dry wetting cyclic attack and chemical sulfate attack note that the specific parameters are unique to the mixture proportion and exposure regime of this study to prove the applicability of the function form proposed some compressive strength data of other researches are listed in table 6 with some detailed information also the good fitting results are presented in fig 5 it is conceivable that our empirical equations can be extended to practical application 3 2 elastic modulus from fig 6 it can be observed that elastic modulus under different exposure tests increases in early exposure period and decreases in later period which are similar with the trend of compressive strength due to continuous hydration the elastic modulus of mortar subjected to exposure 1 increased from 14 6 gpa to 17 2 gpa and then the increment slowed down and just gained 4 1 increase between 120 days and 240 days it even dropped to 17 4 gpa at 270 days which can be attributed to either the standard deviation or the effect of leaching and decalcification of hydration products zhu et al 2013 studied the dynamic elastic modulus of mortar immersed in 0 na2so4 and found the value dropped after 330 days under the residual drying effect of dry wetting cycles in exposure 2 the mortar took shorter time 180 days to the peak value of elastic modulus later the damage of accumulative microcracking overrode the positive residual drying effect and the elastic modulus declined from 18 0 gpa to 16 1 gpa when being exposed to sulfate solution exposure 3 exposure 4 the elastic modulus of samples improved with the progress of immersion or dry wetting cycles until certain days 150 days 90 days subsequently the severe sulfate deterioration decreased the elastic modulus by 16 2 and 20 9 in addition the action of dry wetting cycles of exposure 4 triggered physical sulfate attack in the form of crystalline pressure and volumetric expansion the joint effect of physical and chemical damage shortened the time to the peak value of elastic modulus and sped up the decrease rate in later stage moreover as represented in fig 7 there was a significant correlation between the elastic modulus and the square root of compressive strength of mortar under each exposure condition the damage process had trivial effect on the correlation between the compressive strength and elastic modulus this is also proved by zhou et al 2016 various ranges of coarse and fine aggregates induce diverse compressive strengths and elastic moduli of cement based materials however since those aggregates are made of silica particles and the ingredients of normal concrete and mortar are similar the intrinsic relation between compressive strength and elastic modulus of concrete may be applied to that of mortar analogy to the equation suggested for normal weight concrete aci 2005 the elastic modulus of mortar can be determined by the following eq 4 with r square of 0 960 the result of concrete under sulfate attack with dry wetting cycles zhou et al 2016 can also be described by a similar equation eq 5 with r2 0 940 shown in fig 8 4 e 3 4 f 4 12 5 e 5 8 f 16 67 where e and f are elastic modulus and uniaxial compressive strength respectively even they are of different proportion and exposed to different exposure conditions the sulfate attack does not change the intrinsic relationship between compressive strength and elastic modulus thus it may be reasonable to evaluate the mechanical properties of mortar in different environment via either of the two indicators in field test 3 3 water permeability coefficient since the deterioration starts with the harmful ions transportation by water the transport property e g permeability is critical in the durability of mortar under aggressive conditions fig 9 depicts the logarithm of water permeability coefficient of mortar versus exposure days under different exposure conditions in exposure 1 the logarithm of water permeability coefficient decreased with immersion time the continuous water curing gradually refined the microstructure and decreased the internal flow channel later a lower decrease rate of permeability was observed due to the less hydration after 240 days for specimens in exposure 2 the dry wetting action led to a two staged evolution of water permeability the permeability coefficient decreased from 2 03 10 12 m s to 0 31 10 12 m s during the first period of 150 days then it increased rapidly by 341 9 from 150 days to 270 days indicating that microcracking held dominance in later stage of dry wetting cycle cracks appeared in the microstructure presented in sem analysis also proved it the full immersion in 5 na2so4 solution exposure 3 decreased the permeability coefficient from 2 07 10 12 m s to 0 38 10 12 m s after 150 days exposure the hydration products and expansive reaction products gradually filled the pores of mortar and reduced their connection later microcracking induced by expansion interconnected flow paths and increased permeability to 1 52 10 12 m s at 270 days comparatively the turning point of water permeability coefficient in exposure 3 happened at the same time with that in exposure 2 but that point of compressive strength and elastic modulus in exposure 3 happened earlier than that in exposure 2 it on one hand confirmed the water permeability was more sensitive to deterioration on the other may indicate that sulfate reaction products blocked pore and microcracks decreasing the connectivity to the mortar subjected to exposure 4 permeability experienced more dramatic variation the magnitude of which can vary largely from 10 13 to 10 11 within 90 cycles the filling effect of sulfate crystalline and chemical reaction products decreased the water permeability of mortar and the minimum value of 0 32 10 12 m s reached since the dry wetting regime includes drying at 80 c and wetting at 20 c in which the sodium sulfate is in anhydrous state thenardite for the drying and transformed to hydrous state mirabilite in the later wetting flatt 2002 with the cycles excessive crystalline pressure expansion pressure and repetitive conversion from thenardite to mirabilite caused massive microcrack initiation haynes et al 2008 bassuoni and rahman 2016 those cracks allowed more sulfates to infiltrate into the mortar facilitating deterioration and cracks such chain reaction contributed to the enormous growth in water permeability from 0 32 10 12 m s to 27 0 10 12 m s from above results the evolution of water permeability coefficient is more sensitive than the mechanical properties of deteriorated samples and can be a good indicator to evaluate the mortar durability under deterioration process the compressive strength is determined by the cohesion between the cement paste and aggregates also relevant with the microcracks and porosity while the permeability is highly dependent on the pore continuity and cracks of the microstructures bamforth 1991 moreover our paper proposed similar empirical formulas eq 6 with that for compressive strength to simulate the variation of logarithm of water permeability coefficient in the 4 exposure tests note that the following equations and parameters were derived from our study 6 lg k t lg k 0 p t 2 q t 1 where k t and k 0 are the water permeability coefficient of mortar under exposure for t days and 0 day the fitting parameters of four exposure conditions are presented in table 7 and the fitting effects are depicted in fig 10 there are good agreement between those experiment data and present fitting results those functions not only revealed the effect of each exposure condition on the water permeability coefficient of mortar but conformed to the conclusion obtained in compressive strength similar with the compressive strength when neglecting the influence of parameter q δ p 2 p 2 p 1 δ p 3 p 3 p 1 δ p 4 p 4 p 1 are 2 199 10 6 2 149 10 6 and 5 259 10 6 mainly representing the effect of exposure 2 3 and 4 it is noteworthy that δ p 4 is larger than the sum of δ p 2 and δ p 3 which confirmed the above conclusion that dry wetting cycle with sulfate caused severe physical sulfate attack on mortar besides the chemical sulfate attack and the accumulative dry wetting effect differently the parameter values of water permeability coefficient in exposure 2 were nearly the same with that in exposure 3 indicating that samples under that two conditions experienced similar damage it further supported that the water permeability coefficient was sensitive to microcracking which was the dominant deterioration factor in exposure 2 in the water permeability coefficient the deterioration degree of 4 exposure conditions was in the order of exposure 4 exposure 3 exposure 2 exposure 1 3 4 expansion the length changes of mortar bars exposed to 4 conditions are illustrated in fig 11 the dashed line represents the expansion limit of 0 10 at 26 weeks 182 days which is classified as moderate sulfate resistance as required by astm c1012 astm 2004 the corresponding surface deterioration of mortar samples for 90 and 270 days are also shown respectively in table 8 in exposure 1 mortar bars were emerged into water without water loss which prevented from drying shrinkage the expansion had a slight increase during the early period and then kept stable the surface of mortar had no remarkable change and remained smooth during the whole immersion by comparison for mortar under dry wetting cycle with water exposure 2 shrinkage took place at first and then the length turned stable drying in one cycle vaporized the surface water exerting prestress to contract the volume of sample meanwhile shrinkage was alleviated to some extents due to the subsequent re immersion the residual drying effect made the length slightly decrease to 0 01 after 78 cycles the surface turned whiter after 90 cycles with the cycles going on the contraction was mitigated in the effect of microcracking and the length remained unchanged the initial surface defects also enlarged in the sample surface as shown in table 8 the mortar bar in exposure 3 showed the two staged evolution of expansion which agreed with other studies rozière et al 2009 santhanam et al 2002 during the first 22 days the expansion of the mortar bar was insignificant which was often termed as induction stage after that the mortar started to expand and an accelerating expansion appears after 212 days immersion the dark erosion pits spalling and white powdery material started to appear on the surface after 90 days wider and thicker white powdery material precipitated larger and more erosion pits with spalling and delamination can be inspected at the end of immersion it is conceivable that sulfate ions diffused through the surface pores from outside to inside and the contents near the surface was relatively higher thus the surface pores were inclined to be erosion pits and spalling though being washed the white salt deposited can be observed owing to the high concentrations of sulfates in the pores near surface mortar subjected to exposure 4 suffered most severe expansion at early stage the filling process occurred and led trivial expansion then dry wetting cycle not only induced physical sulfate attack but promoted chemical sulfate attack 1 44 expansion is thus generated in later stage the erosion pits and white powdery material emerged excessively on the surface followed by progressive spalling and delamination this phenomenon was also observed in previous study haynes et al 2008 bassuoni and rahman 2016 nehdi et al 2014 the temperature relative humidity cycling can induce abundant white precipitated substances the combination of hydrated and unhydrated forms of na2so4 efflorescence haynes et al 2008 bassuoni and rahman 2016 the coupled effect of physical and chemical process further amplified other deterioration signs compared with single chemical attack 3 5 sem analysis fig 12 a d show sem micromorphology of mortar subjected to 4 exposure conditions for 270 days respectively in fig 12 a clusters of spinulose c s h crystals and thin hexagonal flake calcium hydroxide crystals can be observed also they were in tight connection representing compact internal microstructure of mortar this can well explain the improved mechanical properties and reduced water permeability of mortar full immersed in water in the effect of 270 dry wetting cycles cracks appeared with some white flocculent substances near the crack edge in fig 12 b the repetitive dry wetting action led to microcrack development which is the channel for leaching it is conceivable that the leaching of calcium hydroxide ca oh 2 caused the decalcification of c s h gels in the form of white substances near the cracks for the mortar immersed in 5 na2so4 solution there was a large amount of needle like ettringite randomly oriented on the surface of the selected mortar portion with loose flocculent c s h crystals nehdi and hayek 2005 ye et al 2014 growth of the columnar or tabulate gypsum and consumption of ca oh 2 were also found ye et al 2014 these expansive reaction products were responsible for the sudden expansion of mortar in the later stage cracks caused by the expansive products nearby can also be detected the loose microstructure was the main reason for the deterioration of mechanical property and increase of permeability when exposed to exposure 4 the mortar portion surface was covered with mass of rod like sodium sulfate crystals which were mainly the combinations of thenardite and mirabilite in the action of dry wetting cycle with sodium sulfate nehdi and hayek 2005 beside the physical sulfate crystalline the white acicular ettringite and columnar and sheet gypsum can be observed both physical and chemical deterioration triggered the cracks but the large amount of physical sulfate crystals was believed to be the leading deterioration factor in the exposure 4 haynes et al 2008 bassuoni and rahman 2016 nehdi et al 2014 3 6 application in in situ tests evaluating the behavior of concrete in situ has become a hot topic for engineering structure assessment and maintenance since mechanical property and durability are two main aspects in concrete structures it is worthwhile to determine the relationship between permeability and mechanical property of deteriorated concrete for a more comprehensive damage assessment though the proportion of concrete in situ is different from that of mortar in laboratory both of them are cement based materials santhanam et al 2002 concluded that the pattern of deterioration and the type of reaction products formed were similar in most of the cementitious mortar systems as the main matrix of concrete mortar is susceptible to sulfate attack the applicability of the empirical formulas for compressive strength has been verified by other types of mortar and concrete above it is reasonable to investigate the water permeability coefficient compressive strength relationships of mortar under different exposure conditions as shown in fig 13 the exposure can be categorized into two types one is immersion with only one phase the other is dry wetting cycling with two phases in immersion type the relationship between water permeability and compressive strength of mortar in early stage approximately equals to that in later stage defined as phase 1 one of the two indexes can be used in the practical assessment in dry wetting cycling type such relationship in first stage differed from that in second stage of exposure it can be explained by that the compressive strength was not as sensitive as permeability to microcracking the dry wetting cycling contributed to the burst of microcracking especially in the later stage thus the variation of permeability was more dramatic than the compressive strength not consistent with that in first stage both of the two properties should be detected for assessment in situ in phase 2 deterioration stage there are three main influential factors to the variations of the relations between water permeability and compressive strength immersion 0 and 5 na2so4 and dry wetting cycles the relationship between them with good fitting is depicted in fig 14 phase 1 of exposure 1 and 2 can be described a linear relation in which the effect of dry wetting cycling of exposure 2 is ignored since the sulfate reaction products initially compact the pores and improve the performance of mortar the variation is expected to be more significant in phase 1 as for phase 2 the dominate factor is dry wetting cycling the effect of sulfate immersion is minor hence it can be concluded that the logarithm of water permeability coefficient were related to the compressive strength of mortar subjected to different exposure but in some case the exposure types and phases needed to be considered based on the above experimental analysis a possible approach to evaluate the sulfate deterioration level in situ for concrete structures was proposed as follows 1 obtain the referential evolution of compressive strength and water permeability coefficient firstly choose the specific types from the exposure 1 4 through the sulfate concentration with without dry wetting cycle on spot then prepare laboratory samples referred to mixture proportions of the concrete structure put them into the specific exposures and conduct mechanical tests and water permeability tests the two indexes are presented as that in figs 3 and 9 2 determine the evaluated property investigate the relationship between compressive strength and water permeability coefficient as shown in figs 13 and 14 if there is only one phase in the exposure i e immersion type any one of the both indexes can be assessed in concrete structures otherwise both of strength and permeability of concrete are recommend detecting in practical assessment 3 judge the deterioration stage of concrete structure firstly detect the compressive strength or and water permeability coefficient of concrete in situ regularly every half a year the tests can be conducted on the drill core samples from the structure or through non destructive methods on selected parts like rebound methods huang et al 2011 qasrawi 2000 and autoclam system basheer 1994 yang et al 2013 and then compare the data on spot to the laboratory referential curves in step 1 to judge if this structures in deterioration stage 4 predict the performance of the structure in the future the empirical functions of the data in laboratory like eq 3 and eq 6 are proposed according to those field data the deterioration process of the structure can be predicted eventually on the basis of the deterioration level judgement and prediction proper measures for structure maintenance can be drawn up 4 conclusion considering the effect of sulfate attack and dry wetting cycles on the offshore structures in marine environment the behavior and associated deterioration mechanism of mortar subjected to four conditions full immersion and dry wetting cycles in 0 and 5 na2so4 solutions were investigated the compressive strength elastic modulus water permeability coefficient of mortar and the relations between them were analyzed also expansion visual inspection and sem analysis were conducted the following conclusions were obtained from experimental results 1 mortar samples in each exposure condition generally exhibited two staged evolution the improvement at first stage and deterioration at later stage but the process evolved differently corresponding to exposure conditions continuous hydration and slow leaching were responsible for the mortar full immersed in 0 na2so4 solution exposure 1 residual drying effect firstly dominated but then overrode by the accumulative microcracking in the process of dry wetting cycle with water exposure 2 chemical sulfate reaction took place in the mortar immersed in 5 na2so4 solution exposure 3 the expansive products gypsum and ettringite at first filled the internal pores later exceeded accommodation capacity and induced microcracking the dry wetting cycles with sulfate exposure 4 brought physical sulfate attack besides chemical one salt growth pressures and repetitive conversion between anhydrous and hydrous form of na2so4 promoted severe deterioration on mortar 2 the evolution of compressive strength and water permeability coefficient of damaged mortar can be well described by binomial functions the function form was also suitable for other researches the linear relationship between elastic modulus and square root of compressive strength was not affected by exposure conditions 3 the effect of exposure 4 to the mortar was more severe than the superstition of exposure 2 and 3 more interestingly the compressive strength variation in exposure 3 was higher than that subjected to dry wetting cycles with water exposure 2 while water permeability exhibited different trend i e exposure 2 and 3 caused similar damage to the mortar 4 the relation between the water permeability coefficient and compressive strength was highly dependent on the sulfate exposure types and time for the sake of practicality and accuracy a possible solution to the in situ concrete assessment under different exposure conditions was established acknowledgements this project was supported by national

23416,the influence of soil plug effect on the dynamic response of large diameter pipe piles during low strain integrity testing is investigated based on the additional mass model considering the soil plug weight and displacement phase difference between soil plug and pipe pile an analytical solution that can consider the stress wave propagating both in the vertical and circumferential directions is derived in the frequency domain through the transfer function method the corresponding quasi analytical solution in the time domain for the pipe pile subjected to a vertical semi sinusoidal impact force is then obtained by utilizing the fourier transform technique the validity and accuracy of the solution presented in this paper is compared against a series of model tests and field experiments of pipe pile utilizing the developed solution a parametric study is performed to illustrate the influence of soil plug properties pipe pile properties and the impulse width of impact force on the composite velocity of the longitudinal stress wave propagating in pipe pile and the applicability of the plane section assumption adopting in pipe pile keywords pile vibration soil plug effect additional mass model composite velocity of pipe pile plane section assumption pile integrity testing 1 introduction low strain integrity testing has been widely used in integrity assessment and length measurement of all kinds of piles for its obvious advantages such as simplicity high efficiency and remarkable economic results likins and rausche 2000 massoudi and teffera 2004 wu et al 2017c the dynamic response measured at pile head is routinely interpreted based on the one dimensional stress wave theory which requires that the stress wave propagating in pile shaft satisfies the plane section assumption liao and roesset 1997 wang et al 2009 wang et al 2010 wu et al 2014 sun et al 2016 when the impact force is applied to the pile head three types of waves i e p wave s wave and r wave radiate from the source due to the fact that the diameter of test hammer is relatively small compared with that of the pile the body waves i e p wave and s wave can propagate not only along the vertical direction but also along the radial and circumferential directions therefore the plane section assumption does not strictly hold for the real dynamic response of piles especially for the large diameter pipe pile always utilized in ocean engineering if the measured dynamic velocity response at pile head is still interpreted based on the conventional one dimensional stress wave theory the abnormal velocity signals are often dismissed as measurement errors or mistaken for pile anomalies which in fact should be attributed to three dimensional 3d effect in the pile dynamic response chen and wang 1998 attributed the high frequency interference at pile head to the superposition of multiple reflections of s wave and r wave at the lateral surface of pile top and proposed a method to calculate the frequency of these interferences chow et al 2003 studied the 3d effect during low strain integrity pile testing with a finite element method and found that for the intact pile the negative component following the incident wave signal peak in the initial velocity response which may be erroneously interpreted as an anomaly near the pile head can be eliminated by placing the receiving accelerometer more than 0 5r from the impact point however for the defect pile the negative component can not be eliminated no matter where the receiving accelerometer is located seidle and tan 2004a 2004b recommended that the interference of rayleigh waves can be eliminated through subtracting the vertical velocity component of rayleigh waves which can be deduced from the measured horizontal velocity component of rayleigh waves by applying an appropriate correlation factor chai et al 2010 investigated the application conditions of the one dimensional stress wave theory and proposed that the hammer radius and the characteristic wavelength have important influence on the 3d effect of wave propagation during pile integrity testing zheng et al 2016a explored the detection of a defective pile with a 3d axisymmetric analytical solution soon later zheng et al 2017 continued the research to develop a 3d non axisymmetric analytical solution to investigate the effect of eccentric impact force on the dynamic response of pile head and put forward a new method to avoid the influence of eccentric impact force by placing receiving accelerometer at the pile head and striking the hammer at optimal range compared with the solid pile the 3d effect of wave propagating in pipe pile is more obvious due to its commonly large cross section and eccentric force impacted on the pile head ignoring the soil resistance fei et al 2007 used a finite element method to investigate the 3d effects in low strain integrity testing of free pipe pile and found that the 3d effects at pipe pile head are affected by bending vibrations vertical vibrations and multiple wave reflections at the surface of pile top lu et al 2012 developed an elastodynamic finite integration technique and identified that the bending waves generated by the non axisymmetric impact force can hardly interfere the reflected wave signal from pile toe because its velocity is far less than that of the p wave however in lu s model the influence of soil plug has not been taken into consideration ding et al 2011a found that the arrival time of reflected wave signals from the defective segment of pipe pile gradually increases with the increasing radius angle between the receiving acceleration transducer and the impact point they also found that this phenomenon gradually weakens as the depth of the defective pile segments increases zheng et al 2015 2016b proved that for the thin walled pipe pile the dynamic velocity response at pile head varies significantly as the receiving accelerometer is moved away from the impact point along the circumferential direction but remains basically unchanged along the radial direction significant progress has been made in the field of 3d effect of wave propagating in pipe pile however fewer attention has been focused on the dynamic interaction model between the soil plug and pipe pile during low strain integrity testing the most widely used models to calculate the soil plug effect during low strain integrity testing can be mainly categorized as winkler model or voigt model and plane strain model in the plane strain model the soil plug resistance translates to the pipe pile via dynamic complex stiffness which assumes that there is no slipping between the soil plug and the inner wall of pipe pile nevertheless both the abovementioned models can not account for the influence of soil plug weight on the dynamic response of pipe pile compared with the pile surrounding soil that extends to infinity radically the soil plug is encircled inside the pipe pile therefore the influence of inertia effect of the soil plug on the dynamic response of pipe pile can not be ignored the additional mass model was proposed by wu et al 2017a to consider the influence of soil plug weight and displacement phase difference between soil plug and pipe pile during vibrations and the validity of this model has been verified by comparing the calculated curves against the results obtained from model tests although wu s inversion velocity curves are generally in good agreement with the measured velocity curves for main feature points wu s solution still can not fully reflect the engineering practice such as the oscillation characteristics of measured velocity curves this may be owing to the fact that wu s solution is based on the one dimensional stress wave theory which can not consider the high frequency interference in pipe pile therefore aimed to clarify the dynamic interaction mechanism between large diameter pipe pile and soil plug an analytical solution which can consider the stress wave propagating both in the vertical and circumferential directions in the large diameter pipe pile is derived based on the additional mass model presented by wu et al 2017a using the solution developed herein a parametric study has been undertaken to investigate the influence of soil plug effect on the dynamic response of pipe pile 2 mathematical model and assumptions the computational model is established in the cylindrical coordinate system as shown in fig 1 considering the variations of the modulus or cross section of the pipe pile and the stratification of the soil the soil pile system is discretized into k segments or layers along the pile shaft that are marked by 1 2 j k from pile tip to pile head the properties of pipe pile and soil layer are assumed to be homogeneous within each segment or layer respectively but may vary from segment to segment or layer to layer the bottom depth of the jth soil pile segment is

height of soil plug are denoted by h and h s respectively the resistance of the jth surrounding soil layer acting on the outer wall of the jth pipe pile segment is depicted as f j s 1 z t which can be expressed as f j s 1 z t k j s 1 u j p z t where k j s 1 is the vertical complex stiffness of the jth soil layer around the outer wall of the jth pipe pile segment and u j p z t is the vertical displacement of the jth pipe pile segment in order to allow for the soil plug weight and the displacement phase difference between soil plug and pipe pile during vibrations the additional mass model is introduced to simulate the dynamic interaction between pipe pile and soil plug the unit mass of the jth soil plug layer is represented by m j s which is regarded as an additional mass of the pipe pile the additional mass m j s is connected to the jth pipe pile segment through the distributed voigt model in which the spring constant and damping coefficient are represented by k j and c j respectively for the pile segment without soil plug it is only required that m j s 0 then the assumptions of the additional mass model can be satisfied the following assumptions are adopted in this paper 1 only the vertical displacements of the soil pile system are taken into consideration and the vertical displacement of the pipe pile is assumed to be invariant along the radial direction zheng

segment respectively 3 3 initial boundary conditions of the soil pile system a fictitious impact force f j z θ t which serves as an intermediate variable to simulate the dynamic interaction at the interface of the adjacent pipe pile segment is introduced and can be expressed as 7 f j z θ t q j sin π t t δ θ t t 2 0 t t 2 j 1 2 k where q j and t are the amplitude and impulse width of the

where c m j and d m j are undetermined coefficients since the point θ 2 π coincides with the point θ it can be obtained that ϕ j p θ ϕ j p θ 2 π and it can be easily concluded that m j n n 1 2 due to

the theoretical model the solution presented in this paper is compared with experimental results and one dimensional solution wu et al 2017a and rayleigh love rod solution wu et al 2017b based on the additional mass model the model pipe pile used in the experimental tests was a polypropylene random pp r of length 2 6 m as shown in fig 2 a the outer diameter wall thickness and density of the model pipe pile were 110 mm 10 mm and 900 kg m3 respectively the material damping coefficient and longitudinal wave velocity of the pipe pile material and the values of spring constant and damping coefficient in the distributed voigt model were obtained by means of parameter inversion method and were set to 29 484 kn s m 2 1 400 m s 785 kn m 3 and 153 kn s m 3 respectively the soil plug was simulated using fine sand with a density of 1 800 kg m 3 the heights of the soil plug was set to h s 0 0 5 1 0 1 5 2 0 and 2 6 m as depicted in fig 2b fig 3 illustrates the comparison of measured and calculated curves of the dynamic velocity response in the time domain at pipe pile top for different soil plug heights it is noting that the arrival time of the peaks of the incident wave signals and the reflected wave signals from the soil plug top and the pipe pile head and toe in the three calculated curves are generally in agreement with those in the measured curves however the curves calculated based on the one dimensional theory and rayleigh love rod theory deviate far from the measured curves at some points especially for the curves between the incident wave signal peak and the first reflected wave signal peak from the pile toe where the calculated curves display relatively smooth whereas the measured curves show some irregular oscillation characteristics the curves calculated with the present solution match much better than those calculated with the one dimensional solution and rayleigh love rod solution this is because the one dimensional solution and rayleigh love rod solution cannot take the high frequency interference at pipe pile head into consideration in practical test the dynamic velocity response received at the pipe pile top is often the superposition of the high frequency interference at pipe pile head and the reflected wave signals from the soil plug and pile toe which may significantly compromise the assessment of the pipe pile quality if the measured curves are interpreted based on the one dimensional theory or rayleigh love rod theory from fig 3 a d it can also be observed that the peak values of the incident wave signals and the first reflected wave signals from soil plug and pipe pile toe in the calculated curves which are obtained with the present solution have a good agreement with those in the measured curves while for the curves after the first reflected wave signals from pipe pile toe it can be found that although the fluctuation tendency of the fitted curves is basically coincided with those of the measured curves the measured curves seem to be overall moved upward with the time increasing and the upward degree gradually weakens with the increase of soil plug height this phenomenon may be due to the fact that the dynamic velocity response measured by the receiver is the superposition of particle vibrations at the pipe pile head and rigid body motion of the whole pipe pile owing to the free support of the model pipe pile when the impact force is exerted on the pipe pile head the model pipe pile generates rigid body motion that decreases with the increase of the mass of model pipe pile compared fig 3 a with fig 3 f due to the existence of soil plug the width of the first reflected wave signal from pipe pile toe has been obviously broadened as shown in fig 3 it is worth noting that with the increase of soil plug height the arrival time of the first reflected wave signal peak from pipe pile toe is gradually delayed which indicates that the composite velocity of the longitudinal stress waves propagating in the model pipe pile decreases with the increase of soil plug height table 1 depicts the calculated and measured composite velocity values for the whole model pipe pile and for the pipe pile segment with the soil plug as shown in table 1 it can be noted that the calculated values have a good agreement with the measured composite velocity and the solution presented in this paper can be used to calculate the practical composite velocity of the longitudinal stress waves propagating in pipe pile with soil plug filling inside in order to further examine the applicability of this theoretical model for the large diameter pipe pile during low strain integrity testing the solution presented in this paper is compared against the measured result of a field experiment conducted by ding et al 2011b where the pipe pile was embedded in a chamber with a size of 5 m length 4 m width 7 m height with the soil plug filling the full inside the length diameter wall thickness and young s modulus of the pipe pile were given as 6 0 m 1 0 m 0 12 m and 24 gpa respectively the values of spring constant and damping coefficient in the distributed voigt model were obtained by employing the parameter inversion method and given as k 600 kn m 3 and c 300 kn s m 3 respectively fig 4 displays the comparison of the calculated dynamic velocity response with the measured curve the time lag between incident wave signal peak and reflected wave signal peak is often adopted to identify pile length or the location of defective pile segment the time lag for the pipe pile with soil plug and for the pipe pile without soil plug is compared with that of the measured curve for different receiving points along the circumferential direction in table 2 and table 3 respectively from fig 4 and table 2 it can be found that the trend of the calculated dynamic velocity response has a good agreement with that of the measured curve in addition comparing tables 1 and 3 it can also be observed that the decreasing degree of composite velocity of the longitudinal stress wave in the field experiment seems much lesser than that in the model pipe pile experiment this phenomenon will be discussed in detail in the following analysis according to the analysis above it can be drawn a conclusion that the theoretical model present in this paper is more reasonable to be used interpreting the measured curves during low strain integrity testing of pipe pile 5 parametric analysis and discussion unless otherwise stated parameters used herein are given as the length outer radius wall thickness poisson s ratio density and young s modulus of the pipe pile are 10 m 0 4 m 0 1 m 0 3 2 500 kg m3 and 30 gpa respectively the height and density of the soil plug are equal to 10 m and 1800 kg m3 respectively the density and shear wave velocity of the soil underlying the pipe pile are set to 1800 kg m3 and 50 m s respectively by referring to the values of the distributed voigt model inverted from abovementioned ding s experiment ding et al 2011b the values of spring constant and damping coefficient in the distributed voigt model are set to k 600 kn m 3 and c 300 kn s m 3 respectively there are some differences between the parameters of ding s experiment and those of the presented theoretical model but according to the parameter sensitivity analysis of the additional mass model performed by wu et al 2017a the values of the distributed voigt model employed in this paper are still reasonable 5 1 influence of surrounding soil properties on the dynamic velocity response of pipe pile first the influence of surrounding soil properties on the dynamic velocity response of pipe pile is investigated the density of surrounding soil is 1800 kg m3 and its shear wave velocity is set to 50 m s 75 m s 100 m s and 125 m s respectively the receiving acceleration transducer is placed at θ 90 from the impact point fig 5 depicts the influence of surrounding soil properties on the dynamic velocity response of pipe pile it can be seen that with the increase of shear wave velocities of the surrounding soil the peak value of the reflected signal from pipe pile toe decreases gradually however the arrival time remains basically unchanged it is observed that the surrounding soil properties show negligible influence on the incident wave signal and the high frequency interference between the incident wave signal peak and the reflected wave signal peak from pipe pile toe in order to accurately distinguish the reflected wave signal of the pipe pile toe from the high frequency interference at pipe pile head the shear wave velocity of soil surrounding is set to 50 m s in the following analysis 5 2 influence of the location of receiving acceleration transducer on the dynamic velocity response of pipe pile lots of attempts have been made to find the optimal position to place the receiving acceleration transducer where the dynamic velocity response measured at pipe pile head suffers the least high frequency interference most of the previous research achievements identify that the point at the radius angle of 90 relative to the impacting point is the optimal position to place the receiving acceleration transducer however the influence of soil plug on the dynamic velocity response of pipe pile for different receiving points along the circumferential direction is still unclear fig 6 demonstrates the influence of the radius angle between the receiving acceleration transducer and impact point on the dynamic velocity response of pipe pile with and without soil plug as indicated in fig 6 a for the pipe pile with soil plug as the receiving acceleration transducer moving away form the impact point the arrival time of the incident wave signal peak and the reflected wave signal peak from pipe pile toe is gradually delayed however for the pipe pile without soil plug as shown in fig 6 b the arrival time of the reflected wave signal peak remains basically unchanged with the variation of the radius angle between receiving acceleration transducer and impact point this phenomenon has been confirmed through a field experiment conducted by lu et al 2012 based on a pipe pile without soil plug filling inside comparing fig 6 a with fig 6 b it can be found that owing to the soil plug effect the applicability of the plane section assumption which assumes the velocity of the longitudinal stress wave propagating in the pile with a same velocity across the whole pile cross section seems to be weakened and this phenomenon will be further confirmed in the following analysis from fig 6 it can also be seen that due to the soil plug effect the arrival time of the reflected wave signal peak is obviously delayed and the width of the reflected wave signal has been widened these variation regulations are in line with those of the model pipe pile experiments in fig 3 in addition it is worth noting that the peak value of the high frequency interference and the incident wave signal decreases first as moving the receiving acceleration transducer away from the impact point reaching the minimum value at θ 90 and then increases again with the increase of radius angle this is because the displacement function of the pipe pile is a function of cos n θ ding et al 2011a 5 3 influence of pipe pile properties on the dynamic velocity response of pipe pile first the influence of wall thickness of the pipe pile on the dynamic velocity response at pile head is investigated the inner radius of the pipe pile is set as 0 3 m and the wall thickness is set to b 0 10 m 0 15 m and 0 20 m respectively other parameters used herein are the same as those utilized in section 5 1 fig 7 portrays the influence of wall thickness of the pipe pile on the dynamic velocity response at pile head it can be found that as the wall thickness decreases the peak values of the incident wave signal and the reflected wave signal from pipe pile toe decrease gradually and the arrival time of the reflected wave signal peak is gradually delayed the peak value of the high frequency interference increases with the decrease of wall thickness the influence of young s modulus of the pipe pile on the dynamic velocity response at pile head is studied in this section the young s modulus of the pipe pile is set to 20 gpa 30 gpa and 40 gpa respectively fig 8 demonstrates the influence of young s modulus of the pipe pile on the dynamic velocity response at pile head with the increase of young s modulus the arrival time of the reflected wave signal peak decreases gradually and the reflected wave signal peak increases gradually the peak value and resonant frequency of the high frequency interference decrease with the increasing young s modulus fig 9 depicts the influence of poisson s ratio of the pipe pile on the dynamic velocity response at pile head the poisson s ratio of the pipe pile is set to 0 2 0 25 and 0 3 respectively as shown in fig 9 it can be observed that with the increase of poisson s ratio the arrival time of the reflected wave signal peak has a gentle decrease which means the longitudinal wave velocity propagating in the pipe pile has a corresponding increase this is because the longitudinal wave velocity propagating in the pipe pile is a function of v and can be expressed as c p c 0 1 v 1 2 v 1 v where c 0 is the longitudinal wave velocity propagating in one dimensional rod the longitudinal wave velocity propagating in the pipe pile is positive correlation with its poisson s ratio 5 4 influence of impulse width of impact force on the dynamic velocity response of pipe pile fig 10 presents the influence of impulse width of impact force on the dynamic velocity response at pile head the impulse width used herein is set to 0 8 ms 1 0 ms and 1 2 ms as indicated in fig 10 with the increase of impulse width of impact force the arrival time of the incident wave signal peak and the reflected wave signal peak from the pipe pile toe is gradually delayed and the peak values of these signals increase gradually the peak value of the high frequency interference decreases with the increase of impulse width 5 5 influence of soil plug on the composite propagation velocity of the pipe pile from figs 3 and 4 it is worth noting that the soil plug filling inside the pipe pile can lead to the decrease of the composite velocity of longitudinal stress wave propagating in pipe pile through the comparison of fig 6 a and b it can be observed that owing to the soil plug effect the arrival time of the reflected wave signal peak increases as the receiving acceleration transducer moving away form the impact point in order to further clarify the influence of soil plug on the composite propagation velocity of pipe pile the delay time which is defined as the difference value of the time lags between the incident wave signal peak and reflected wave signal peak for the pipe pile with soil plug and without soil plug is investigated for different receiving points along the circumferential direction first the influence of soil plug on the arrival time of the incident wave signal peak is studied for different receiving points along the circumferential direction the impulse width of the impact force is set as 1 0 ms fig 11 demonstrates the comparison of the arrival time of the incident wave signal peak for the pipe pile with soil plug and without soil plug it can be seen that the soil plug gives rise to negligible influence on the arrival time of the incident wave signal peak in this section the influence of soil plug on the delay time of pipe pile is investigated for different pipe pile properties fig 12 a b and c display the influence of soil plug on the delay time of pipe pile for different wall thickness young s modulus and poisson s ratio of the pipe pile respectively the parameters used in fig 12 a b and c are the same as those in figs 7 9 respectively as demonstrated in fig 12 the soil plug filling inside the pipe pile can lead to the increase of the time lag between the incident wave signal peak and the reflected wave signal peak the time delay degree increases with the decrease of wall thickness and young s modulus and the increase of poisson s ratio of pipe pile in other words the above result indicates that owing to the soil plug the composite velocity of longitudinal stress wave propagating in pipe pile decreases with the decrease of wall thickness and young s modulus and the increase of poisson s ratio of pipe pile the delay time generally increases as the receiving acceleration transducer moving away from the impact point in addition the variation range of delay time along the circumferential direction becomes larger as the decrease of wall thickness and young s modulus and the increase of poisson s ratio this phenomenon implies that attributing to the soil plug the applicability of the plane section assumption decreases as the decrease of wall thickness and young s modulus and the increase of poisson s ratio of pipe pile based on the above analysis this paper presents a concept of energy transmission ability of pipe pile say etapp it can be drawn that the etapp decreases with the decrease of wall thickness and young s modulus and the increase of poisson s ratio of pipe pile owing to the soil plug filling in pipe pile the composite propagation velocity of pipe pile and the applicability of the plane section assumption for the pipe pile decrease with the decrease of etapp fig 13 depicts the influence of soil plug on the delay time of pipe pile for different impulse widths of impact force the parameters used herein are the same as those in fig 10 as shown in fig 13 it can be observed that the influence of the impulse width of impact force on the delay time of pipe pile is so gentle that can be neglected which suggests that the impulse width of impact force can hardly affected the composite velocity of longitudinal stress wave propagating in pipe pile in addition it can also be seen that the influence of the impulse width of impact force on the applicability of plane section assumption for pipe pile is also negligible 6 conclusions the additional mass model can consider the influence of soil plug weight and displacement phase difference between soil plug and pipe pile on the dynamic velocity response of pipe pile during low strain integrity testing based on the additional mass model an analytical solution which can consider the longitudinal stress wave propagating both in the vertical and circumferential directions is derived through the transfer function method the validity and accuracy of the solution presented in this paper is compared against a series of model pipe pile experiments and field experiments based on the above analysis several conclusions can be drawn as 1 the fitted curves calculated based on the present solution have a good agreement with the measured curves of the model pipe pile experiments and the field experiments 2 the soil plug leads to a decrease of composite propagation velocity of pipe pile and a weaker applicability of the plane section assumption for pipe pile 3 the concept of energy transmission ability of pipe pile etapp is proposed the etapp decreases with the decrease of wall thickness and young s modulus and the increase of poisson s ratio of pipe pile for the pipe pile with soil plug the composite propagation velocity of pipe pile and the applicability of the plane section assumption decrease with the decrease of etapp 4 due to the soil plug the width of the first reflected wave signal from pile toe becomes broadened and the arrival time of the reflected wave signal peak is delayed 5 the widen impulse time has advantages to obtain a clearer dynamic velocity curve however it can hardly affect the composite propagation velocity and the applicability of the plane section

23416,the influence of soil plug effect on the dynamic response of large diameter pipe piles during low strain integrity testing is investigated based on the additional mass model considering the soil plug weight and displacement phase difference between soil plug and pipe pile an analytical solution that can consider the stress wave propagating both in the vertical and circumferential directions is derived in the frequency domain through the transfer function method the corresponding quasi analytical solution in the time domain for the pipe pile subjected to a vertical semi sinusoidal impact force is then obtained by utilizing the fourier transform technique the validity and accuracy of the solution presented in this paper is compared against a series of model tests and field experiments of pipe pile utilizing the developed solution a parametric study is performed to illustrate the influence of soil plug properties pipe pile properties and the impulse width of impact force on the composite velocity of the longitudinal stress wave propagating in pipe pile and the applicability of the plane section assumption adopting in pipe pile keywords pile vibration soil plug effect additional mass model composite velocity of pipe pile plane section assumption pile integrity testing 1 introduction low strain integrity testing has been widely used in integrity assessment and length measurement of all kinds of piles for its obvious advantages such as simplicity high efficiency and remarkable economic results likins and rausche 2000 massoudi and teffera 2004 wu et al 2017c the dynamic response measured at pile head is routinely interpreted based on the one dimensional stress wave theory which requires that the stress wave propagating in pile shaft satisfies the plane section assumption liao and roesset 1997 wang et al 2009 wang et al 2010 wu et al 2014 sun et al 2016 when the impact force is applied to the pile head three types of waves i e p wave s wave and r wave radiate from the source due to the fact that the diameter of test hammer is relatively small compared with that of the pile the body waves i e p wave and s wave can propagate not only along the vertical direction but also along the radial and circumferential directions therefore the plane section assumption does not strictly hold for the real dynamic response of piles especially for the large diameter pipe pile always utilized in ocean engineering if the measured dynamic velocity response at pile head is still interpreted based on the conventional one dimensional stress wave theory the abnormal velocity signals are often dismissed as measurement errors or mistaken for pile anomalies which in fact should be attributed to three dimensional 3d effect in the pile dynamic response chen and wang 1998 attributed the high frequency interference at pile head to the superposition of multiple reflections of s wave and r wave at the lateral surface of pile top and proposed a method to calculate the frequency of these interferences chow et al 2003 studied the 3d effect during low strain integrity pile testing with a finite element method and found that for the intact pile the negative component following the incident wave signal peak in the initial velocity response which may be erroneously interpreted as an anomaly near the pile head can be eliminated by placing the receiving accelerometer more than 0 5r from the impact point however for the defect pile the negative component can not be eliminated no matter where the receiving accelerometer is located seidle and tan 2004a 2004b recommended that the interference of rayleigh waves can be eliminated through subtracting the vertical velocity component of rayleigh waves which can be deduced from the measured horizontal velocity component of rayleigh waves by applying an appropriate correlation factor chai et al 2010 investigated the application conditions of the one dimensional stress wave theory and proposed that the hammer radius and the characteristic wavelength have important influence on the 3d effect of wave propagation during pile integrity testing zheng et al 2016a explored the detection of a defective pile with a 3d axisymmetric analytical solution soon later zheng et al 2017 continued the research to develop a 3d non axisymmetric analytical solution to investigate the effect of eccentric impact force on the dynamic response of pile head and put forward a new method to avoid the influence of eccentric impact force by placing receiving accelerometer at the pile head and striking the hammer at optimal range compared with the solid pile the 3d effect of wave propagating in pipe pile is more obvious due to its commonly large cross section and eccentric force impacted on the pile head ignoring the soil resistance fei et al 2007 used a finite element method to investigate the 3d effects in low strain integrity testing of free pipe pile and found that the 3d effects at pipe pile head are affected by bending vibrations vertical vibrations and multiple wave reflections at the surface of pile top lu et al 2012 developed an elastodynamic finite integration technique and identified that the bending waves generated by the non axisymmetric impact force can hardly interfere the reflected wave signal from pile toe because its velocity is far less than that of the p wave however in lu s model the influence of soil plug has not been taken into consideration ding et al 2011a found that the arrival time of reflected wave signals from the defective segment of pipe pile gradually increases with the increasing radius angle between the receiving acceleration transducer and the impact point they also found that this phenomenon gradually weakens as the depth of the defective pile segments increases zheng et al 2015 2016b proved that for the thin walled pipe pile the dynamic velocity response at pile head varies significantly as the receiving accelerometer is moved away from the impact point along the circumferential direction but remains basically unchanged along the radial direction significant progress has been made in the field of 3d effect of wave propagating in pipe pile however fewer attention has been focused on the dynamic interaction model between the soil plug and pipe pile during low strain integrity testing the most widely used models to calculate the soil plug effect during low strain integrity testing can be mainly categorized as winkler model or voigt model and plane strain model in the plane strain model the soil plug resistance translates to the pipe pile via dynamic complex stiffness which assumes that there is no slipping between the soil plug and the inner wall of pipe pile nevertheless both the abovementioned models can not account for the influence of soil plug weight on the dynamic response of pipe pile compared with the pile surrounding soil that extends to infinity radically the soil plug is encircled inside the pipe pile therefore the influence of inertia effect of the soil plug on the dynamic response of pipe pile can not be ignored the additional mass model was proposed by wu et al 2017a to consider the influence of soil plug weight and displacement phase difference between soil plug and pipe pile during vibrations and the validity of this model has been verified by comparing the calculated curves against the results obtained from model tests although wu s inversion velocity curves are generally in good agreement with the measured velocity curves for main feature points wu s solution still can not fully reflect the engineering practice such as the oscillation characteristics of measured velocity curves this may be owing to the fact that wu s solution is based on the one dimensional stress wave theory which can not consider the high frequency interference in pipe pile therefore aimed to clarify the dynamic interaction mechanism between large diameter pipe pile and soil plug an analytical solution which can consider the stress wave propagating both in the vertical and circumferential directions in the large diameter pipe pile is derived based on the additional mass model presented by wu et al 2017a using the solution developed herein a parametric study has been undertaken to investigate the influence of soil plug effect on the dynamic response of pipe pile 2 mathematical model and assumptions the computational model is established in the cylindrical coordinate system as shown in fig 1 considering the variations of the modulus or cross section of the pipe pile and the stratification of the soil the soil pile system is discretized into k segments or layers along the pile shaft that are marked by 1 2 j k from pile tip to pile head the properties of pipe pile and soil layer are assumed to be homogeneous within each segment or layer respectively but may vary from segment to segment or layer to layer the bottom depth of the jth soil pile segment is

height of soil plug are denoted by h and h s respectively the resistance of the jth surrounding soil layer acting on the outer wall of the jth pipe pile segment is depicted as f j s 1 z t which can be expressed as f j s 1 z t k j s 1 u j p z t where k j s 1 is the vertical complex stiffness of the jth soil layer around the outer wall of the jth pipe pile segment and u j p z t is the vertical displacement of the jth pipe pile segment in order to allow for the soil plug weight and the displacement phase difference between soil plug and pipe pile during vibrations the additional mass model is introduced to simulate the dynamic interaction between pipe pile and soil plug the unit mass of the jth soil plug layer is represented by m j s which is regarded as an additional mass of the pipe pile the additional mass m j s is connected to the jth pipe pile segment through the distributed voigt model in which the spring constant and damping coefficient are represented by k j and c j respectively for the pile segment without soil plug it is only required that m j s 0 then the assumptions of the additional mass model can be satisfied the following assumptions are adopted in this paper 1 only the vertical displacements of the soil pile system are taken into consideration and the vertical displacement of the pipe pile is assumed to be invariant along the radial direction zheng et al 2015 2016a 2016b 2 the pipe pile is a viscoelastic hollow cylinder and is in perfect contact with pile surrounding soil during vibration 3 the pile surrounding soil is viscoelastic stratified and extending infinitely in the radial diction the top surface of the pile surrounding soil is free boundary 4 the dynamic resistance of surrounding soil translating to the outer wall of pipe pile is via vertical shear complex stiffness on the contact interface of the soil pile system 5 the soil pile system is subjected to small deformations and strains during vibration 6 at the beginning of vibration the displacement and velocity of pipe pile and soil plug are zero 3 general equations and their solutions 3 1 dynamic equation of pile surrounding soil and its solution the dynamic equation

the dynamic equation of the jth soil plug segment can be given as 5 k j u j p z θ t u j s z θ t c j u j p z θ t u j s z θ t t 2 π r j 2 ρ j s π r j 2 2 2 u j s z θ t t 2 where ρ j s 2 denotes the mass

segment respectively 3 3 initial boundary conditions of the soil pile system a fictitious impact force f j z θ t which serves as an intermediate variable to simulate the dynamic interaction at the interface of the adjacent pipe pile segment is introduced and can be expressed as 7 f j z θ t q j sin π t t δ θ t t 2 0 t t 2 j 1 2 k where q j and t are the amplitude and impulse width of the

the theoretical model the solution presented in this paper is compared with experimental results and one dimensional solution wu et al 2017a and rayleigh love rod solution wu et al 2017b based on the additional mass model the model pipe pile used in the experimental tests was a polypropylene random pp r of length 2 6 m as shown in fig 2 a the outer diameter wall thickness and density of the model pipe pile were 110 mm 10 mm and 900 kg m3 respectively the material damping coefficient and longitudinal wave velocity of the pipe pile material and the values of spring constant and damping coefficient in the distributed voigt model were obtained by means of parameter inversion method and were set to 29 484 kn s m 2 1 400 m s 785 kn m 3 and 153 kn s m 3 respectively the soil plug was simulated using fine sand with a density of 1 800 kg m 3 the heights of the soil plug was set to h s 0 0 5 1 0 1 5 2 0 and 2 6 m as depicted in fig 2b fig 3 illustrates the comparison of measured and calculated curves of the dynamic velocity response in the time domain at pipe pile top for different soil plug heights it is noting that the arrival time of the peaks of the incident wave signals and the reflected wave signals from the soil plug top and the pipe pile head and toe in the three calculated curves are generally in agreement with those in the measured curves however the curves calculated based on the one dimensional theory and rayleigh love rod theory deviate far from the measured curves at some points especially for the curves between the incident wave signal peak and the first reflected wave signal peak from the pile toe where the calculated curves display relatively smooth whereas the measured curves show some irregular oscillation characteristics the curves calculated with the present solution match much better than those calculated with the one dimensional solution and rayleigh love rod solution this is because the one dimensional solution and rayleigh love rod solution cannot take the high frequency interference at pipe pile head into consideration in practical test the dynamic velocity response received at the pipe pile top is often the superposition of the high frequency interference at pipe pile head and the reflected wave signals from the soil plug and pile toe which may significantly compromise the assessment of the pipe pile quality if the measured curves are interpreted based on the one dimensional theory or rayleigh love rod theory from fig 3 a d it can also be observed that the peak values of the incident wave signals and the first reflected wave signals from soil plug and pipe pile toe in the calculated curves which are obtained with the present solution have a good agreement with those in the measured curves while for the curves after the first reflected wave signals from pipe pile toe it can be found that although the fluctuation tendency of the fitted curves is basically coincided with those of the measured curves the measured curves seem to be overall moved upward with the time increasing and the upward degree gradually weakens with the increase of soil plug height this phenomenon may be due to the fact that the dynamic velocity response measured by the receiver is the superposition of particle vibrations at the pipe pile head and rigid body motion of the whole pipe pile owing to the free support of the model pipe pile when the impact force is exerted on the pipe pile head the model pipe pile generates rigid body motion that decreases with the increase of the mass of model pipe pile compared fig 3 a with fig 3 f due to the existence of soil plug the width of the first reflected wave signal from pipe pile toe has been obviously broadened as shown in fig 3 it is worth noting that with the increase of soil plug height the arrival time of the first reflected wave signal peak from pipe pile toe is gradually delayed which indicates that the composite velocity of the longitudinal stress waves propagating in the model pipe pile decreases with the increase of soil plug height table 1 depicts the calculated and measured composite velocity values for the whole model pipe pile and for the pipe pile segment with the soil plug as shown in table 1 it can be noted that the calculated values have a good agreement with the measured composite velocity and the solution presented in this paper can be used to calculate the practical composite velocity of the longitudinal stress waves propagating in pipe pile with soil plug filling inside in order to further examine the applicability of this theoretical model for the large diameter pipe pile during low strain integrity testing the solution presented in this paper is compared against the measured result of a field experiment conducted by ding et al 2011b where the pipe pile was embedded in a chamber with a size of 5 m length 4 m width 7 m height with the soil plug filling the full inside the length diameter wall thickness and young s modulus of the pipe pile were given as 6 0 m 1 0 m 0 12 m and 24 gpa respectively the values of spring constant and damping coefficient in the distributed voigt model were obtained by employing the parameter inversion method and given as k 600 kn m 3 and c 300 kn s m 3 respectively fig 4 displays the comparison of the calculated dynamic velocity response with the measured curve the time lag between incident wave signal peak and reflected wave signal peak is often adopted to identify pile length or the location of defective pile segment the time lag for the pipe pile with soil plug and for the pipe pile without soil plug is compared with that of the measured curve for different receiving points along the circumferential direction in table 2 and table 3 respectively from fig 4 and table 2 it can be found that the trend of the calculated dynamic velocity response has a good agreement with that of the measured curve in addition comparing tables 1 and 3 it can also be observed that the decreasing degree of composite velocity of the longitudinal stress wave in the field experiment seems much lesser than that in the model pipe pile experiment this phenomenon will be discussed in detail in the following analysis according to the analysis above it can be drawn a conclusion that the theoretical model present in this paper is more reasonable to be used interpreting the measured curves during low strain integrity testing of pipe pile 5 parametric analysis and discussion unless otherwise stated parameters used herein are given as the length outer radius wall thickness poisson s ratio density and young s modulus of the pipe pile are 10 m 0 4 m 0 1 m 0 3 2 500 kg m3 and 30 gpa respectively the height and density of the soil plug are equal to 10 m and 1800 kg m3 respectively the density and shear wave velocity of the soil underlying the pipe pile are set to 1800 kg m3 and 50 m s respectively by referring to the values of the distributed voigt model inverted from abovementioned ding s experiment ding et al 2011b the values of spring constant and damping coefficient in the distributed voigt model are set to k 600 kn m 3 and c 300 kn s m 3 respectively there are some differences between the parameters of ding s experiment and those of the presented theoretical model but according to the parameter sensitivity analysis of the additional mass model performed by wu et al 2017a the values of the distributed voigt model employed in this paper are still reasonable 5 1 influence of surrounding soil properties on the dynamic velocity response of pipe pile first the influence of surrounding soil properties on the dynamic velocity response of pipe pile is investigated the density of surrounding soil is 1800 kg m3 and its shear wave velocity is set to 50 m s 75 m s 100 m s and 125 m s respectively the receiving acceleration transducer is placed at θ 90 from the impact point fig 5 depicts the influence of surrounding soil properties on the dynamic velocity response of pipe pile it can be seen that with the increase of shear wave velocities of the surrounding soil the peak value of the reflected signal from pipe pile toe decreases gradually however the arrival time remains basically unchanged it is observed that the surrounding soil properties show negligible influence on the incident wave signal and the high frequency interference between the incident wave signal peak and the reflected wave signal peak from pipe pile toe in order to accurately distinguish the reflected wave signal of the pipe pile toe from the high frequency interference at pipe pile head the shear wave velocity of soil surrounding is set to 50 m s in the following analysis 5 2 influence of the location of receiving acceleration transducer on the dynamic velocity response of pipe pile lots of attempts have been made to find the optimal position to place the receiving acceleration transducer where the dynamic velocity response measured at pipe pile head suffers the least high frequency interference most of the previous research achievements identify that the point at the radius angle of 90 relative to the impacting point is the optimal position to place the receiving acceleration transducer however the influence of soil plug on the dynamic velocity response of pipe pile for different receiving points along the circumferential direction is still unclear fig 6 demonstrates the influence of the radius angle between the receiving acceleration transducer and impact point on the dynamic velocity response of pipe pile with and without soil plug as indicated in fig 6 a for the pipe pile with soil plug as the receiving acceleration transducer moving away form the impact point the arrival time of the incident wave signal peak and the reflected wave signal peak from pipe pile toe is gradually delayed however for the pipe pile without soil plug as shown in fig 6 b the arrival time of the reflected wave signal peak remains basically unchanged with the variation of the radius angle between receiving acceleration transducer and impact point this phenomenon has been confirmed through a field experiment conducted by lu et al 2012 based on a pipe pile without soil plug filling inside comparing fig 6 a with fig 6 b it can be found that owing to the soil plug effect the applicability of the plane section assumption which assumes the velocity of the longitudinal stress wave propagating in the pile with a same velocity across the whole pile cross section seems to be weakened and this phenomenon will be further confirmed in the following analysis from fig 6 it can also be seen that due to the soil plug effect the arrival time of the reflected wave signal peak is obviously delayed and the width of the reflected wave signal has been widened these variation regulations are in line with those of the model pipe pile experiments in fig 3 in addition it is worth noting that the peak value of the high frequency interference and the incident wave signal decreases first as moving the receiving acceleration transducer away from the impact point reaching the minimum value at θ 90 and then increases again with the increase of radius angle this is because the displacement function of the pipe pile is a function of cos n θ ding et al 2011a 5 3 influence of pipe pile properties on the dynamic velocity response of pipe pile first the influence of wall thickness of the pipe pile on the dynamic velocity response at pile head is investigated the inner radius of the pipe pile is set as 0 3 m and the wall thickness is set to b 0 10 m 0 15 m and 0 20 m respectively other parameters used herein are the same as those utilized in section 5 1 fig 7 portrays the influence of wall thickness of the pipe pile on the dynamic velocity response at pile head it can be found that as the wall thickness decreases the peak values of the incident wave signal and the reflected wave signal from pipe pile toe decrease gradually and the arrival time of the reflected wave signal peak is gradually delayed the peak value of the high frequency interference increases with the decrease of wall thickness the influence of young s modulus of the pipe pile on the dynamic velocity response at pile head is studied in this section the young s modulus of the pipe pile is set to 20 gpa 30 gpa and 40 gpa respectively fig 8 demonstrates the influence of young s modulus of the pipe pile on the dynamic velocity response at pile head with the increase of young s modulus the arrival time of the reflected wave signal peak decreases gradually and the reflected wave signal peak increases gradually the peak value and resonant frequency of the high frequency interference decrease with the increasing young s modulus fig 9 depicts the influence of poisson s ratio of the pipe pile on the dynamic velocity response at pile head the poisson s ratio of the pipe pile is set to 0 2 0 25 and 0 3 respectively as shown in fig 9 it can be observed that with the increase of poisson s ratio the arrival time of the reflected wave signal peak has a gentle decrease which means the longitudinal wave velocity propagating in the pipe pile has a corresponding increase this is because the longitudinal wave velocity propagating in the pipe pile is a function of v and can be expressed as c p c 0 1 v 1 2 v 1 v where c 0 is the longitudinal wave velocity propagating in one dimensional rod the longitudinal wave velocity propagating in the pipe pile is positive correlation with its poisson s ratio 5 4 influence of impulse width of impact force on the dynamic velocity response of pipe pile fig 10 presents the influence of impulse width of impact force on the dynamic velocity response at pile head the impulse width used herein is set to 0 8 ms 1 0 ms and 1 2 ms as indicated in fig 10 with the increase of impulse width of impact force the arrival time of the incident wave signal peak and the reflected wave signal peak from the pipe pile toe is gradually delayed and the peak values of these signals increase gradually the peak value of the high frequency interference decreases with the increase of impulse width 5 5 influence of soil plug on the composite propagation velocity of the pipe pile from figs 3 and 4 it is worth noting that the soil plug filling inside the pipe pile can lead to the decrease of the composite velocity of longitudinal stress wave propagating in pipe pile through the comparison of fig 6 a and b it can be observed that owing to the soil plug effect the arrival time of the reflected wave signal peak increases as the receiving acceleration transducer moving away form the impact point in order to further clarify the influence of soil plug on the composite propagation velocity of pipe pile the delay time which is defined as the difference value of the time lags between the incident wave signal peak and reflected wave signal peak for the pipe pile with soil plug and without soil plug is investigated for different receiving points along the circumferential direction first the influence of soil plug on the arrival time of the incident wave signal peak is studied for different receiving points along the circumferential direction the impulse width of the impact force is set as 1 0 ms fig 11 demonstrates the comparison of the arrival time of the incident wave signal peak for the pipe pile with soil plug and without soil plug it can be seen that the soil plug gives rise to negligible influence on the arrival time of the incident wave signal peak in this section the influence of soil plug on the delay time of pipe pile is investigated for different pipe pile properties fig 12 a b and c display the influence of soil plug on the delay time of pipe pile for different wall thickness young s modulus and poisson s ratio of the pipe pile respectively the parameters used in fig 12 a b and c are the same as those in figs 7 9 respectively as demonstrated in fig 12 the soil plug filling inside the pipe pile can lead to the increase of the time lag between the incident wave signal peak and the reflected wave signal peak the time delay degree increases with the decrease of wall thickness and young s modulus and the increase of poisson s ratio of pipe pile in other words the above result indicates that owing to the soil plug the composite velocity of longitudinal stress wave propagating in pipe pile decreases with the decrease of wall thickness and young s modulus and the increase of poisson s ratio of pipe pile the delay time generally increases as the receiving acceleration transducer moving away from the impact point in addition the variation range of delay time along the circumferential direction becomes larger as the decrease of wall thickness and young s modulus and the increase of poisson s ratio this phenomenon implies that attributing to the soil plug the applicability of the plane section assumption decreases as the decrease of wall thickness and young s modulus and the increase of poisson s ratio of pipe pile based on the above analysis this paper presents a concept of energy transmission ability of pipe pile say etapp it can be drawn that the etapp decreases with the decrease of wall thickness and young s modulus and the increase of poisson s ratio of pipe pile owing to the soil plug filling in pipe pile the composite propagation velocity of pipe pile and the applicability of the plane section assumption for the pipe pile decrease with the decrease of etapp fig 13 depicts the influence of soil plug on the delay time of pipe pile for different impulse widths of impact force the parameters used herein are the same as those in fig 10 as shown in fig 13 it can be observed that the influence of the impulse width of impact force on the delay time of pipe pile is so gentle that can be neglected which suggests that the impulse width of impact force can hardly affected the composite velocity of longitudinal stress wave propagating in pipe pile in addition it can also be seen that the influence of the impulse width of impact force on the applicability of plane section assumption for pipe pile is also negligible 6 conclusions the additional mass model can consider the influence of soil plug weight and displacement phase difference between soil plug and pipe pile on the dynamic velocity response of pipe pile during low strain integrity testing based on the additional mass model an analytical solution which can consider the longitudinal stress wave propagating both in the vertical and circumferential directions is derived through the transfer function method the validity and accuracy of the solution presented in this paper is compared against a series of model pipe pile experiments and field experiments based on the above analysis several conclusions can be drawn as 1 the fitted curves calculated based on the present solution have a good agreement with the measured curves of the model pipe pile experiments and the field experiments 2 the soil plug leads to a decrease of composite propagation velocity of pipe pile and a weaker applicability of the plane section assumption for pipe pile 3 the concept of energy transmission ability of pipe pile etapp is proposed the etapp decreases with the decrease of wall thickness and young s modulus and the increase of poisson s ratio of pipe pile for the pipe pile with soil plug the composite propagation velocity of pipe pile and the applicability of the plane section assumption decrease with the decrease of etapp 4 due to the soil plug the width of the first reflected wave signal from pile toe becomes broadened and the arrival time of the reflected wave signal peak is

dynamic ultimate strength are discussed keywords dynamic ultimate strength in plane compressive loading rotational restraints strain rate initial imperfection 1 introduction over the past few decades much research has been conducted on the ultimate strength of ship structures and some useful methods have been developed however most methods of computing the ultimate strength were based on quasi static approaches they can be broadly classified into following categories caldwell method caldwell 1965 nonlinear finite element method tekgoz et al 2018 idealized structural unit method ueda and rashed 1984 and smith method smith 1977 a large number of experimental studies have been performed in order to investigate the ultimate strength characteristics of box girders gordo and guedes soares 2009 gordo and guedes soares 2014 saad eldeen and garbatov 2011 ao and wang 2016 hussein and guedes soares hussein and guedes soares 2009 have studied the ultimate strength of double hull tankers designed according to iacs common structural rules and developed also the respective reliability formulation shu and moan 2012 investigated the ultimate strength of a capesize bulk carrier hull girder under combined global and local loads in the hogging and alternate hold loading ahl condition systematically by using nonlinear fe analysis with abaqus software cui and wang cui et al 2017 studied the ultimate strength of container ship hull girder and local structures under pure bending both hogging and sagging pure torsion and combined bending and torsional moments including the effects of nonlinear corrosion cui et al and yang cui et al 2016 presents the numerical results of ultimate strength of cracked plates under uniaxial compression the bottom plate of all ships is subjected to lateral pressure in addition to the in plane loads the behaviour of plates under compression and lateral loads was studied by teixeira and guedes soares teixeira and guedes soares 2001 while stiffened panels were considered by guedes soares and gordo guedes soares and gordo 1996 paik and seo 2009a paik and seo 2009b developed some useful insights on nonlinear finite element method application for ultimate limit state assessment of steel stiffened plate structures subject to combined biaxial compression and lateral pressure actions xu and guedes soares xu and guedes soares 2012 studied the ultimate strength of five narrow stiffened panels with two stiffeners under axial compression based on finite element analysis and the numerical results are in good agreement with experimental results xu and guedes soares xu and guedes soares 2013 conducted a series of numerical calculations of the load displacement behaviour of five specimens which compared well with the experimental results khedmati et al 2009 investigated the post buckling behaviour and ultimate strength characteristics of high strength stiffened aluminium plates of which material and geometric non linearities were taken into account subjected to combined in plane compressive and lateral loads actions by using non linear finite element method it can be seen that various methods have been developed to study the ultimate strength of ship structures under all kinds of load types the one common point for these loads is static so all these studies did not consider the dynamic effects however external loading is usually dynamic with high amplitude when ships encounter with a large wave wang and guedes soares 2013 hull plate may buckle and collapse under compressive loading action if it exceeds the critical loads with the increase of the size and design speed of a ship the amplitude of the dynamic loads is larger and the dynamic duration is shorter which often results in more apparent dynamic characteristics therefore it is of importance to study the ultimate strength characteristics of ship plate structures under dynamic loads as well as quasi static loads wang et al 2016 studied the dynamic structural response of ship bottom plates with forward speed under the transverse slamming impact and the compressive loading of hull bending yang and wang 2017a yang and wang 2016 studied the dynamic buckling of the ship plates with elastically restrained edges subjected to in plane half sine impact load a new simple dynamic buckling criterion was developed buckling of thin plates and stiffened plate with v grooves under axial impact load by moving mass was studied by chen and so chen et al 2007 so and chen 2007 the nonlinear dynamic buckling of rectangular plates considering initial imperfections subjected to various pulse functions with six different boundary conditions is investigated by ramezannezhad et al 2015 it can be noted that the dynamic response and buckling of ship plating under impact loading without considering the material non linearities have been studied largely therefore it is necessary to study the dynamic ultimate of the ship structures which include the effects of material non linearities the dynamic ultimate strength analysis of ship plates or hull girders is rarely found in published literature experimental and numerical methods are usually available methods to study the dynamic ultimate strength of stiffened plate under impact loading cui et al 1999 carried out a series water entry tests to investigate the dynamic post buckling properties of the simply supported rectangular plate under intermediate velocity slamming loads cheong et al 2000 experimentally studied the dynamic post buckling behaviour and plastic collapse modes of rectangular plates subjected to fluid solid slamming a suitable critical dynamic plastic collapse criterion was presented to determine the load bearing capacity of the plates numerical calculations are also performed and numerical results compared well with the test results paik paik and thayamballi 2003a conducted a series of dynamic ultimate compressive strength tests on ship plating under axial compressive loads by with different loading speeds liu et al 2015 carried out the falling weight impact experiment of a stiffened plates and numerical calculation based on finite element method to study the dynamic collapse behaviour with considering the effect of strain rates similar falling weight tests and finite element calculations have been conducted by liu et al 2013 and villavicencio and guedes soares villavicencio and guedes soares 2013 yang and wang 2017b studied the dynamic ultimate hull girder strength analysis on container ship subjected to impact bending moment based on 3 d nonlinear explicit finite element model in this paper the ultimate strength of a stiffened plate under in plane compression is important both because its ultimate strength can act as an indicator of the hull girder strength and also because a stiffened plate can be considered as a structural unit whose load end shortening response is directly used in the evaluation of the ultimate strength of the hull girder margaritis and toulios 2012 the present paper is focused on the dynamic ultimate limit states of stiffened plates which derived from 10 000teu container ship surrounded by strong support members such as longitudinal girders and transverse frames the dynamic ultimate strength of outer bottom stiffened plate of ships under combined in plane compressive loads and lateral pressure is studied the influences of the initial imperfections boundary conditions lateral pressure strain rate and structural dimensions on the dynamic ultimate strength characteristics were discussed in detail 2 fe models for analysis 2 1 geometric data and material modelling the present study addresses the dynamic ultimate strength of the outer bottom stiffened plate of ships the geometry properties of the stiffened plate are shown in fig 1 where x y and z denote longitudinal transverse and vertical directions respectively the length total breadth breadth between the two transverse frames and thickness of the stiffened plate are denoted as a b b and t p the geometrical properties of the cross section of angle bar stiffeners are shown in fig 2 the geometric dimensions of the four stiffeners are denoted as h w height of stiffener web t w thickness of stiffener web b f breadth of stiffener flange and t f thickness of stiffener flange z 0 is the distance from the plate bottom to the neutral axis of a stiffener β b t p δ y e is the slenderness ratio of plating between longitudinal stiffeners for an illustrative example the present study adopts outer bottom stiffened plate of 10 000teu container ships where the geometry of the panel is a 4300 mm b 3991 mm the longitudinal stiffener spacing b is varied at 734 and 841 mm while the number of longitudinal stiffeners is 4 to study the effects structural dimensions on the dynamic ultimate strength of the stiffened plate the other three stiffened plates with four equally distributed stiffeners were studied and the values of b are 734 and 841 respectively the values of geometrical properties of the stiffened plate are summarized in table 1 the material of the plates and stiffeners derived from 10 000teu container ship are high tensile steel with young s modulus e 2 06 105mpa poisson s ratio υ 0 3 yield strength σ y 315 mpa and material density ρ 7 8 106 kg mm3 when attention is paid to the dynamic ultimate strength of the stiffened plate it is unavoidable for the unstable nonlinear problem it is necessary to establish the nonlinear material model in terms of the relationship between stress and strain in the present study the dynamic yield strength is given by the cowper symonds power equation liu et al 2014 liu et al 2017a as follows 1 σ y d σ y 1 ε c 1 q where ε is the plastic strain rate c and q are coefficients to be determined based on test data for various materials paik and thayamballi 2018 for example the parameters for the initial yield of mild steel under dynamic loading are c 40 4s 1 and q 5 also paik et al paik 2007 determined a sample set of the cowper symonds coefficients for high tensile steel as c 3200s 1 and q 5 the collapse mode of a stiffened panel can be classified into the following six types namely paik and thayamballi 2018 mode i overall collapse mode mode ii collapse of plating between stiffeners without failure of stiffeners mode iii beam column type collapse of stiffeners with attached plating mode iv local buckling of stiffener web after collapse of plating mode v lateral torsional buckling of stiffeners after collapse of plating mode vi gross yielding of the entire panel 2 2 applied boundary conditions most current practical design criteria from classification societies for the buckling and ultimate strength of ship plates are focused on simplified boundary conditions such as simply supported or clamped boundary conditions liu et al 2017b paik and thayamballi 2003b in general stiffened plates are supported by strong members such as longitudinal girders and transverse frames along the edges which provided a finite amount of the rotational restraint stiffness for this case the rotational restraints along the edges can neither be regarded as simply supported nor clamped boundary conditions yang and wang 2017a yang and wang 2016 therefore it is of great importance and significance to the model boundary condition of the stiffened plate in a relevant way xu et al 2013a it is a good way to include the effects of the rotational restraints along edges by taking a wide extent of the fe model including the support members as tanaka et al 2014 and xu et al 2013b indicated that the research models can be divided into four types according to modelling size in each direction along longitudinal girder and transverse frame i e the 1 2 1 2 span 1 2 1 2 bay 1 2 1 2 span 1 2 1 1 2bay 1 2 1 1 2 span 1 2 1 2 bay and 1 2 1 1 2 span 1 2 1 1 2 bay models span denotes the scope in longitudinal direction while bay denotes the transverse direction in the present paper the 1 2 1 1 2 span 1 2 1 1 2 bay model is used to consider the influence of the rotational restrains along the edges it can be seen from fig 3 that a half length of the target panel is extended along the transverse direction and longitudinal direction while the transverse and longitudinal frames were not shown although it will be more accurate to include the transverse and longitudinal frames in the fe model for simplicity of modelling and saving computation time an fe model without including the transverse frames is often used the boundary conditions are shown in fig 3 where u denotes translation ur denotes rotations and the subscripts denote the coordinate axis respectively a 0 indicates constraint and a 1 indicates no constraint 2 3 initial imperfections during the fabrication and welding process of the ship steel plating it is unavoidable to cause certain amounts of initial imperfections these imperfections are primarily summarized as initial deflections and welding residual stresses both of them may lead to a reduction of the strength and stiffness of ship structures ueda et al 1995 recent studies indicated that the effect of welding residual with an average value on the ultimate strength of structures is very small paik and sohn 2012 chen and guedes soares 2016 paik et al 2009 lots of papers had demonstrated that the initial deflection is a very important influence factor for the ultimate strength analysis of ship hull structures guedes soares 1988 sadovský et al 2005 saad eldeen et al 2012 therefore only the influences of the initial deflections are discussed in the present study the amplitude of initial imperfections can be given by eq 2 khedmati et al 2009 2 w 0 max c β 2 t the value of coefficient c mainly relates to the level of initial imperfection the amplitude of the initial imperfection can be described as following according to the study of smith et al 1988 3 w 0 max 0 025 β 2 t for slight level 0 1 β 2 t for a v e r a g e level 0 3 β 2 t for severe level it is usually considered that the shape of initial deflection is consistent with the plate buckling mode which may give the lowest resistance against the external loading in this paper the effect of another initial imperfection shape of plate initial deflection is also studied paik et al 2008 steen et al 2004 studied the ultimate strength of the stiffened plate with considering the influence of initial deflection w 0max 0 1β 2 with a first buckling mode shape khedmati khedmati et al 2009 simulated the complex pattern of initial deflection by applying lateral pressure and the initial defection shape was obtained in the present study the influence of these two kinds of initial defection shapes imp 1 and imp 2 with an average value are studied they are shown in fig 4 the shape 1 is the first buckling mode of the stiffened plate while the initial imperfection with shape 2 is similar with one presented in khedmati khedmati et al 2009 2 4 loading condition the most vulnerable loading conditions for the outer bottom stiffened plate structures in ships when traversing a large wave are dynamic in plane compressive load and static lateral pressure actions as shown in fig 5 the research model adopted in the present paper is from the ship outer bottom stiffened plate the lateral pressures consist of static and dynamic lateral pressures the values of dynamic lateral pressures are usually very small compared with the static pressures so the dynamic lateral pressures were not included in this paper the stiffened plate is derived from 10 000teu container ship surrounded by strong support members such as longitudinal girders and transverse frames since the design draught of 10 000teu container ship is d 13 m so the three draft heights 1 2 d d and 3 2 d are chosen to study the influences of lateral pressures on the dynamic ultimate strength of the stiffened plate the corresponding values of lateral pressures are 63 7 kn m2 127 4 kn m2 and 191 1 kn m2 respectively the application of the dynamic loads in the present study is the same as in paik paik and thayamballi 2003a who conducted a series of experimental investigations on the ultimate strength characteristics for ship plating under dynamic compressive loads of which loading speed was varied from 10 0 mm s to 3907 2 mm s 2 5 nonlinear fe mesh modelling for the modelling of the stiffened plate structures s4r element type is used to model the panel stiffener webs and stiffener flanges the s4r element type is a four node doubly curved general purpose shell that offers reduced integration to control hourglass instability per element node has six degrees of freedom three elements were used to model the stiffener flange in the flange breadth direction and 12 elements for stiffener web in the web height direction in order to save computational time and make sure the precision of the results the models with a mesh size of 30 mm are adopted the total number of elements of the stiffened plate is 47 523 and the total number of nodes is 47 960 the nodes at two ends of the fe model are connected with the corresponding reference points by using the mpc multiple points constraint option function in plane compressive loads are applied to the reference points independent points 3 numerical validation 3 1 paik and thayamballi tests the aim of the present study is to study the dynamic ultimate strength of the outer bottom stiffened plate of ships based on the nonlinear fe analysis the test data of paik and thayanballi paik and thayamballi 2003c were used to validate the applicability of the numerical method a total of four rectangular plates with simply supported edges were tested by paik and thayamballi 2003c dynamic in plane compressive loading is applied by using an mts servo controlled hydraulic dynamic testing machine of 100 kn capacity the speed of loading always kept constant during the whole test process four different loading speeds were adopted to study the dynamic ultimate strength characteristics of the rectangular plate the strain rate ε of the test model is expressed as a function of the loading speed v 0 and given in eq 4 4 ε v 0 a where a is the length of the rectangular plate the loading speeds ranged from 0 05 mm s to 400 mm s which the corresponding strain rates ranged from 10 4s 1 to 0 8s 1 the detailed geometrical dimensions and material parameters of test specimens and test setup can be found in paik and thayamballi 2003c table 2 shows the comparison of the dynamic compressive load and end shortening between numerical and test method under the different loading speeds the ultimate strength values derived from the numerical method compared well with the experimental results while the end shortening at the ultimate limit state between the two methods were very different actually the concern is the value of the dynamic ultimate strength so the numerical method can be used to calculate the dynamic ultimate strength of the stiffened plate 3 2 static ultimate strength of the stiffened plate paik paik and thayamballi 1997 derived a simple and reasonably accurate empirical formulation to predict the ultimate strength of longitudinally stiffened plates under uniaxial compression the empirical formulation implicitly considers the effect of initial imperfections at an average large level the useful expression for predicting the ultimate strength of the stiffened plate is described in terms of the plate slenderness ratio and the column slenderness ratio as follow 5 σ u σ 0 1 0 995 0 936 λ 2 0 170 β 2 0 188 λ 2 β 2 0 067 λ 4 where λ is the column slenderness ratio of the stiffener with full plating r is the radius of gyration of the stiffener with full plating i is moment of inertia of stiffener with full plating z 0 is neutral axis height a is area of the cross section of the stiffened plate they are expressed as follow 6 λ a π r σ y e 7 r i a 8 i b t p 3 12 b t p z 0 t p 2 2 h w 3 t w 12 h w t w z 0 t p h w 2 2 b f t f 3 12 b f t f z 0 t p h w t f 2 2 9 z 0 b t p 2 2 h w t w t p h w 2 b f t f t p h w t f 2 a 10 a b t p h w t w b f t f fig 6 shows the relevant comparisons of the static ultimate strength of stiffened plate with simply supported edges between the empirical formulation and numerical method it can be seen that the results obtained from the nonlinear fe method agree well with the empirical formulation the error of the ultimate strength for these two methods was just 3 6 4 dynamic ultimate strength of stiffened plates a series of dynamic ultimate strength analyses are performed on the stiffened plate model under in plane compressive loading and lateral pressure based on nonlinear fe method 1 bay 1 span model with simply supported and clamped boundary conditions were also studied to compare with the present 1 2 1 1 2 span 1 2 1 1 2 bay model xu et al 2017 studied the ultimate strength of hull girder based on explicit dynamic analysis and the influence of loading time which depend on the wave period in this paper the dynamic ultimate strength of the stiffened plate derived from 10 000teu container ship under combined in plane slamming loading and lateral pressure were studied it is well known that the slamming loading usually has a very short duration with milliseconds order wang and guedes soares 2013 wang et al 2016 yang and wang 2017a yang and wang 2016 therefore eight different strain rates which range from 10 4s 1 to 1 4s 1 were adopted in the investigation on the dynamic ultimate strength of the stiffened plate the corresponding loading time range from 0 002s to 0 34s the influences of the strain rate boundary conditions and initial imperfections on the dynamic ultimate strength were studied in the following fig 7 shows the compressive loads versus axial end shortening curves of the stiffened plate at an average large level it can be found that the end shortening length of the reference point increase with the increase of the strain rates except for the case when ε 0 6s 1 due to the fact that the larger dynamic yield stress means the stiffened plate has a larger stiffness to resist deformation the reason why the shortening length for the case ε 0 6s 1 is larger than the case ε 0 8s 1 maybe the stress wave velocity v s for the case ε 0 8s 1 is just an integer multiple of the loading speed v s 1000v 0 and then lead to resonance response the dynamic ultimate strength of the stiffened plate corresponds quite closely to the static ultimate strength when the ε 0 003s 1 which implies that the dynamic characteristic of the stiffened plate is very unapparent when strain rate is enough small it can also be seen that the fluctuation of curves become more and more severe with the increase of strain rates this because the high frequency response of stiffened plate will be excited under high speed impact loading action it can be clearly seen that the dynamic ultimate strength of the stiffened plates increased with the increase of the loading speeds this because the strain rates of the material increase along with the loading speeds and then the larger strain rates usually lead to the larger dynamic yield stress the average stresses of the stiffened plate at the ultimate limit state against the strain rate are summarized in table 3 which shows that the stiffened plate with the initial imperfection at a severe level collapsed completely before yielding failure under quasi static compressive loading ε 0 003s 1 whether the stiffened plate loses carrying capacity before yielding or not depends on the strain rate and initial imperfection the influence of initial imperfections on the dynamic ultimate strength of the stiffened plate with eight different loading speeds is shown in fig 8 it can be clearly seen that the dynamic ultimate compressive loads increase with the increase of strain rates and it is insensitive to the strain rate when the ε 1 0s 1 the reason may be that the curve of dynamic constitutive relation will become smooth with the increase of the strain rate according to cowper symonds equation moreover the ratio of the dynamic ultimate strength ratio for the case ε 0 6 s 1 at a slight level initial imperfection to that at a severe initial imperfection is more than 1 45 times which shows the initial imperfections have an important influence on the dynamic ultimate strength of stiffened plates the ratios of the maximum dynamic ultimate strength to the static ultimate strength of the stiffened plate for three initial imperfections slight level average level and severe level are 1 756 1 863 and 1 893 respectively therefore it can be concluded that loading speed has an important influence on the ultimate strength of the stiffened plate so it is too conservative to assess the ultimate strength of ship plating under dynamic loads in terms of static ultimate strength criterion furthermore the larger initial imperfection results in the smaller dynamic ultimate strength it is worth noting that the results between slight level and average level are very close except for the case ε 0 6 fig 9 shows that the dynamic ultimate strength curves with different initial imperfection shapes the dynamic ultimate strength with the initial imperfection shape 1 is larger when ε 0 6 on the contrary it has a larger value for the initial imperfection shape 2 when ε 0 6 initial imperfection shapes have an apparent effect on the dynamic ultimate strength of stiffened plates so it will be useful to predict the dynamic ultimate strength accurately by measuring the initial imperfection shape induced by fabrication fig 10 shows the deformed shapes and von mises stress distributions of the stiffened plate at the ultimate limit state for two initial imperfections the maximum stress response at the ultimate limit state increases with the increase of strain rates it is found that the collapse modes of the stiffened plates with different initial imperfections are totally different for the stiffened plates with the imp 1 at three strain rates the collapse modes are local buckling of stiffener web after the collapse of plating mode iv however the collapse modes of the stiffened plate with imp 2 are overall collapse mode mode i and the higher order collapse modes will be activated with the increase of strain rates additionally the effects of different lateral pressure quantities on the ultimate strength were studied as shown in fig 11 for the static ultimate strength it is very apparent that the ultimate strength decreases with increased lateral pressure and the difference value between the maximum and minimum ultimate strength is 6 5 therefore lateral pressures play an important role in the static ultimate strength analysis of stiffened plates however the effects of the lateral pressure on the dynamic ultimate strength were negligible and dynamic ultimate strength of the stiffened plate has no obvious regularity to the lateral pressures the boundary conditions are also very important to the ultimate strength of the stiffened plate the three boundary restrained edges were discussed in this paper and the effects of these boundary conditions are shown in fig 12 as depicted in fig 12 the simply supported and clamped boundary condition has the smallest and the largest dynamic ultimate strength respectively moreover the dynamic ultimate strength of the stiffened plate for the extend model is located between simply supported and clamped boundary conditions it implies that by increasing the restriction in the supports the resistance ability against the stability of the stiffened plate increases for the static ultimate strength of the stiffened plate the results for clamped boundary condition compare well with the results of the extend model and the error between simply supported or clamped and the extend model is 13 7 1 8 therefore it is more realistic to compute the static ultimate strength of the outer bottom stiffened plate by adopting clamped boundary condition than simply supported boundary condition in terms of the dynamic ultimate strength analysis of the stiffened plate under in plane compressive loading although two simplified boundary conditions cannot represent the more realistic results it is better to adopt the clamped boundary condition for predicting the dynamic ultimate strength of the stiffened plate when simplified boundary conditions are adopted for simplicity and saving calculation time in the calculation of practical engineering problems it can also be found that the results for the three boundary conditions are very close when ε 1 2s 1 fig 13 compares the deformed shapes of the stiffened plates with three different boundary conditions it can be seen that the deformation of the plate under in plane dynamic loading grows to keep the same mode with the assumed initial imperfection shape and the higher order buckling modes will be activated when the strain rates increase the collapse modes for these stiffened plates are local buckling of stiffener web after collapse of plating mode iv fig 14 shows that the dynamic ultimate strength curves with varying structural dimensions all these curves have same change trend the results of the two stiffened plates with equally distributed stiffeners d2 and d3 are quite close while the stiffened plate with unevenly distributed stiffeners d1 had the largest ultimate strength results the longitudinal stiffener spacing b has a minimal impact on the ultimate strength of the stiffened plate with equally distributed stiffeners when the length of loading edges and the number of stiffeners is still the same however it is just the opposite for the stiffened plate with unevenly distributed stiffeners these results will be very useful for the strength optimization of stiffened plates fig 15 shows the deformed shapes and von mises stress distributions of the stiffened plate at the ultimate limit state varying the longitudinal stiffener spacing the maximum stress response at the ultimate limit state increases with the increase of strain rates it is found that the collapse modes between d1 and d2 are totally different however the stress response of d1and d2 are quite close this is the reason why these two stiffened plates have the same dynamic ultimate strength though the maximum stress response of the d1 is minimum the dynamic ultimate strength is largest among these stiffened plates because the mean stress of d1 at the ultimate limit state is larger than the other two stiffened plates 5 conclusions nonlinear fe method was used to calculate the dynamic ultimate strength of the outer ship bottom stiffened plate structures under in plane compressive loads with considering the effects of rotational restraints along edges the influences of initial imperfections and boundary conditions on the dynamic ultimate strength were discussed in detail a multitude of available results of the present study can be summarized as follows the dynamic ultimate compressive loads increase with the increase of strain rates the larger initial imperfection results in the smaller static and dynamic ultimate strength it is worth noting that the results between slight level and average level are very close except for the case ε 0 6 lateral pressures play an important role in the static ultimate strength analysis of stiffened plates on the contrary the effects of the lateral pressure on the dynamic ultimate strength can be negligible the dynamic ultimate strength derived from clamped boundary condition is closer to the results for the extend model the numerical results obtained in the present paper are very useful for the ultimate limit state of stiffened plates subjected to dynamic in plane compressive loads actually the loading speed cannot keep constant during the dynamic analysis process of the stiffened plate so in the future study the equivalent relationship between forced velocity loading and impact loading will be established to study the dynamic ultimate strength of ship plates more reasonably acknowledgements the work

much research has been conducted on the ultimate strength of ship structures and some useful methods have been developed however most methods of computing the ultimate strength were based on quasi static approaches they can be broadly classified into following categories caldwell method caldwell 1965 nonlinear finite element method tekgoz et al 2018 idealized structural unit method ueda and rashed 1984 and smith method smith 1977 a large number of experimental studies have been performed in order to investigate the ultimate strength characteristics of box girders gordo and guedes soares 2009 gordo and guedes soares 2014 saad eldeen and garbatov 2011 ao and wang 2016 hussein and guedes soares hussein and guedes soares 2009 have studied the ultimate strength of double hull tankers designed according to iacs common structural rules and developed also the respective reliability formulation shu and moan 2012 investigated the ultimate strength of a capesize bulk carrier hull girder under combined global and local loads in the hogging and alternate hold loading ahl condition systematically by using nonlinear fe analysis with abaqus software cui and wang cui et al 2017 studied the ultimate strength of container ship hull girder and local structures under pure bending both hogging and sagging pure torsion and combined bending and torsional moments including the effects of nonlinear corrosion cui et al and yang cui et al 2016 presents the numerical results of ultimate strength of cracked plates under uniaxial compression the bottom plate of all ships is subjected to lateral pressure in addition to the in plane loads the behaviour of plates under compression and lateral loads was studied by teixeira and guedes soares teixeira and guedes soares 2001 while stiffened panels were considered by guedes soares and gordo guedes soares and gordo 1996 paik and seo 2009a paik and seo 2009b developed some useful insights on nonlinear finite element method application for ultimate limit state assessment of steel stiffened plate structures subject to combined biaxial compression and lateral pressure actions xu and guedes soares xu and guedes soares 2012 studied the ultimate strength of five narrow stiffened panels with two stiffeners under axial compression based on finite element analysis and the numerical results are in good agreement with experimental results xu and guedes soares xu and guedes soares 2013 conducted a series of numerical calculations of the load displacement behaviour of five specimens which compared well with the experimental results khedmati et al 2009 investigated the post buckling behaviour and ultimate strength characteristics of high strength stiffened aluminium plates of which material and geometric non linearities were taken into account subjected to combined in plane compressive and lateral loads actions by using non linear finite element method it can be seen that various methods have been developed to study the ultimate strength of ship structures under all kinds of load types the one common point for these loads is static so all these studies did not consider the dynamic effects however external loading is usually dynamic with high amplitude when ships encounter with a large wave wang and guedes soares 2013 hull plate may buckle and collapse under compressive loading action if it exceeds the critical loads with the increase of the size and design speed of a ship the amplitude of the dynamic loads is larger and the dynamic duration is shorter which often results in more apparent dynamic characteristics therefore it is of importance to study the ultimate strength characteristics of ship plate structures under dynamic loads as well as quasi static loads wang et al 2016 studied the dynamic structural response of ship bottom plates with forward speed under the transverse slamming impact and the compressive loading of hull bending yang and wang 2017a yang and wang 2016 studied the dynamic buckling of the ship plates with elastically restrained edges subjected to in plane half sine impact load a new simple dynamic buckling criterion was developed buckling of thin plates and stiffened plate with v grooves under axial impact load by moving mass was studied by chen and so chen et al 2007 so and chen 2007 the nonlinear dynamic buckling of rectangular plates considering initial imperfections subjected to various pulse functions with six different boundary conditions is investigated by ramezannezhad et al 2015 it can be noted that the dynamic response and buckling of ship plating under impact loading without considering the material non linearities have been studied largely therefore it is necessary to study the dynamic ultimate of the ship structures which include the effects of material non linearities the dynamic ultimate strength analysis of ship plates or hull girders is rarely found in published literature experimental and numerical methods are usually available methods to study the dynamic ultimate strength of stiffened plate under impact loading cui et al 1999 carried out a series water entry tests to investigate the dynamic post buckling properties of the simply supported rectangular plate under intermediate velocity slamming loads cheong et al 2000 experimentally studied the dynamic post buckling behaviour and plastic collapse modes of rectangular plates subjected to fluid solid slamming a suitable critical dynamic plastic collapse criterion was presented to determine the load bearing capacity of the plates numerical calculations are also performed and numerical results compared well with the test results paik paik and thayamballi 2003a conducted a series of dynamic ultimate compressive strength tests on ship plating under axial compressive loads by with different loading speeds liu et al 2015 carried out the falling weight impact experiment of a stiffened plates and numerical calculation based on finite element method to study the dynamic collapse behaviour with considering the effect of strain rates similar falling weight tests and finite element calculations have been conducted by liu et al 2013 and villavicencio and guedes soares villavicencio and guedes soares 2013 yang and wang 2017b studied the dynamic ultimate hull girder strength analysis on container ship subjected to impact bending moment based on 3 d nonlinear explicit finite element model in this paper the ultimate strength of a stiffened plate under in plane compression is important both because its ultimate strength can act as an indicator of the hull girder strength and also because a stiffened plate can be considered as a structural unit whose load end shortening response is directly used in the evaluation of the ultimate strength of the hull girder margaritis and toulios 2012 the present paper is focused on the dynamic ultimate limit states of stiffened plates which derived from 10 000teu container ship surrounded by strong support members such as longitudinal girders and transverse frames the dynamic ultimate strength of outer bottom stiffened plate of ships under combined in plane compressive loads and lateral pressure is studied the influences of the initial imperfections boundary conditions lateral pressure strain rate and structural dimensions on the dynamic ultimate strength characteristics were discussed in detail 2 fe models for analysis 2 1 geometric data and material modelling the present study addresses the dynamic ultimate strength of the outer bottom stiffened plate of ships the geometry properties of the stiffened plate are shown in fig 1 where x y and z denote longitudinal transverse and vertical directions respectively the length total breadth breadth between the two transverse frames and thickness of the stiffened plate are denoted as a b b and t p the geometrical properties of the cross section of angle bar stiffeners are shown in fig 2 the geometric dimensions of the four stiffeners are denoted as h w height of stiffener web t w thickness of stiffener web b f breadth of stiffener flange and t f thickness of stiffener flange z 0 is the distance from the plate bottom to the neutral axis of a stiffener β b t p δ y e is the slenderness ratio of plating between longitudinal stiffeners for an illustrative example the present study adopts outer bottom stiffened plate of 10 000teu container ships where the geometry of the panel is a 4300 mm b 3991 mm the longitudinal stiffener spacing b is varied at 734 and 841 mm while the number of longitudinal stiffeners is 4 to study the effects structural dimensions on the dynamic ultimate strength of the stiffened plate the other three stiffened plates with four equally distributed stiffeners were studied and the values of b are 734 and 841 respectively the values of geometrical properties of the stiffened plate are summarized in table 1 the material of the plates and stiffeners derived from 10 000teu container ship are high tensile steel with young s modulus e 2 06 105mpa poisson s ratio υ 0 3 yield strength σ y 315 mpa and material density ρ 7 8 106 kg mm3 when attention is paid to the dynamic ultimate strength of the stiffened plate it is unavoidable for the unstable nonlinear problem it is necessary to establish the nonlinear material model in terms of the relationship between stress and strain in the present study the dynamic yield strength is given by the cowper symonds power equation liu et al 2014 liu et al 2017a as follows 1 σ y d σ y 1 ε c 1 q where ε is the plastic strain rate c and q are coefficients to be determined based on test data for various materials paik and thayamballi 2018 for example the parameters for the initial yield of mild steel under dynamic loading are c 40 4s 1 and q 5 also paik et al paik 2007 determined a sample set of the cowper symonds coefficients for high tensile steel as c 3200s 1 and q 5 the collapse mode of a stiffened panel can be classified into the following six types namely paik and thayamballi 2018 mode i overall collapse mode mode ii collapse of plating between stiffeners without failure of stiffeners mode iii beam column type collapse of stiffeners with attached plating mode iv local buckling of stiffener web after collapse of plating mode v lateral torsional buckling of stiffeners after collapse of plating mode vi gross yielding of the entire panel 2 2 applied boundary conditions most current practical design criteria from classification societies for the buckling and ultimate strength of ship plates are focused on simplified boundary conditions such as simply supported or clamped boundary conditions liu et al 2017b paik and thayamballi 2003b in general stiffened plates are supported by strong members such as longitudinal girders and transverse frames along the edges which provided a finite amount of the rotational restraint stiffness for this case the rotational restraints along the edges can neither be regarded as simply supported nor clamped boundary conditions yang and wang 2017a yang and wang 2016 therefore it is of great importance and significance to the model boundary condition of the stiffened plate in a relevant way xu et al 2013a it is a good way to include the effects of the rotational restraints along edges by taking a wide extent of the fe model including the support members as tanaka et al 2014 and xu et al 2013b indicated that the research models can be divided into four types according to modelling size in each direction along longitudinal girder and transverse frame i e the 1 2 1 2 span 1 2 1 2 bay 1 2 1 2 span 1 2 1 1 2bay 1 2 1 1 2 span 1 2 1 2 bay and 1 2 1 1 2 span 1 2 1 1 2 bay models span denotes the scope in longitudinal direction while bay denotes the transverse direction in the present paper the 1 2 1 1 2 span 1 2 1 1 2 bay model is used to consider the influence of the rotational restrains along the edges it can be seen from fig 3 that a half length of the target panel is extended along the transverse direction and longitudinal direction while the transverse and longitudinal frames were not shown although it will be more accurate to include the transverse and longitudinal frames in the fe model for simplicity of modelling and saving computation time an fe model without including the transverse frames is often used the boundary conditions are shown in fig 3 where u denotes translation ur denotes rotations and the subscripts denote the coordinate axis respectively a 0 indicates constraint and a 1 indicates no constraint 2 3 initial imperfections during the fabrication and welding process of the ship steel plating it is unavoidable to cause certain amounts of initial imperfections these imperfections are primarily summarized as initial deflections and welding residual stresses both of them may lead to a reduction of the strength and stiffness of ship structures ueda et al 1995 recent studies indicated that the effect of welding residual with an average value on the ultimate strength of structures is very small paik and sohn 2012 chen and guedes soares 2016 paik et al 2009 lots of papers had demonstrated that the initial deflection is a very important influence factor for the ultimate strength analysis of ship hull structures guedes soares 1988 sadovský et al 2005 saad eldeen et al 2012 therefore only the influences of the initial deflections are discussed in the present study the amplitude of initial imperfections can be given by eq 2 khedmati et al 2009 2 w 0 max c β 2 t the value of coefficient c mainly relates to the level of initial imperfection the amplitude of the initial imperfection can be described as following according to the study of smith et al 1988 3 w 0 max 0 025 β 2 t for slight level 0 1 β 2 t for a v e r a g e level 0 3 β 2 t for severe level it is usually considered that the shape of initial deflection is consistent with the plate buckling mode which may give the lowest resistance against the external loading in this paper the effect of another initial imperfection shape of plate initial deflection is also studied paik et al 2008 steen et al 2004 studied the ultimate strength of the stiffened plate with considering the influence of initial deflection w 0max 0 1β 2 with a first buckling mode shape khedmati khedmati et al 2009 simulated the complex pattern of initial deflection by applying lateral pressure and the initial defection shape was obtained in the present study the influence of these two kinds of initial defection shapes imp 1 and imp 2 with an average value are studied they are shown in fig 4 the shape 1 is the first buckling mode of the stiffened plate while the initial imperfection with shape 2 is similar with one presented in khedmati khedmati et al 2009 2 4 loading condition the most vulnerable loading conditions for the outer bottom stiffened plate structures in ships when traversing a large wave are dynamic in plane compressive load and static lateral pressure actions as shown in fig 5 the research model adopted in the present paper is from the ship outer bottom stiffened plate the lateral pressures consist of static and dynamic lateral pressures the values of dynamic lateral pressures are usually very small compared with the static pressures so the dynamic lateral pressures were not included in this paper the stiffened plate is derived from 10 000teu container ship surrounded by strong support members such as longitudinal girders and transverse frames since the design draught of 10 000teu container ship is d 13 m so the three draft heights 1 2 d d and 3 2 d are chosen to study the influences of lateral pressures on the dynamic ultimate strength of the stiffened plate the corresponding values of lateral pressures are 63 7 kn m2 127 4 kn m2 and 191 1 kn m2 respectively the application of the dynamic loads in the present study is the same as in paik paik and thayamballi 2003a who conducted a series of experimental investigations on the ultimate strength characteristics for ship plating under dynamic compressive loads of which loading speed was varied from 10 0 mm s to 3907 2 mm s 2 5 nonlinear fe mesh modelling for the modelling of the stiffened plate structures s4r element type is used to model the panel stiffener webs and stiffener flanges the s4r element type is a four node doubly curved general purpose shell that offers reduced integration to control hourglass instability per element node has six degrees of freedom three elements were used to model the stiffener flange in the flange breadth direction and 12 elements for stiffener web in the web height direction in order to save computational time and make sure the precision of the results the models with a mesh size of 30 mm are adopted the total number of elements of the stiffened plate is 47 523 and the total number of nodes is 47 960 the nodes at two ends of the fe model are connected with the corresponding reference points by using the mpc multiple points constraint option function in plane compressive loads are applied to the reference points independent points 3 numerical validation 3 1 paik and thayamballi tests the aim of the present study is to study the dynamic ultimate strength of the outer bottom stiffened plate of ships based on the nonlinear fe analysis the test data of paik and thayanballi paik and thayamballi 2003c were used to validate the applicability of the numerical method a total of four rectangular plates with simply supported edges were tested by paik and thayamballi 2003c dynamic in plane compressive loading is applied by using an mts servo controlled hydraulic dynamic testing machine of 100 kn capacity the speed of loading always kept constant during the whole test process four different loading speeds were adopted to study the dynamic ultimate strength characteristics of the rectangular plate the strain rate ε of the test model is expressed as a function of the loading speed v 0 and given in eq 4 4 ε v 0 a where a is the length of the rectangular plate the loading speeds ranged from 0 05 mm s to 400 mm s which the corresponding strain rates ranged from 10 4s 1 to 0 8s 1 the detailed geometrical dimensions and material parameters of test specimens and test setup can be found in paik and thayamballi 2003c table 2 shows the comparison of the dynamic compressive load and end shortening between numerical and test method under the different loading speeds the ultimate strength values derived from the numerical method compared well with the experimental results while the end shortening at the ultimate limit state between the two methods were very different actually the concern is the value of the dynamic ultimate strength so the numerical method can be used to calculate the dynamic ultimate strength of the stiffened plate 3 2 static ultimate strength of the stiffened plate paik paik and thayamballi 1997 derived a simple and reasonably accurate empirical formulation to predict the ultimate strength of longitudinally stiffened plates under uniaxial compression the empirical formulation implicitly considers the effect of initial imperfections at an average large level the useful expression for predicting the ultimate strength of the stiffened plate is described in terms of the plate slenderness ratio and the column slenderness ratio as follow 5 σ u σ 0 1 0 995 0 936 λ 2 0 170 β 2 0 188 λ 2 β 2 0 067 λ 4 where λ is the column slenderness ratio of the stiffener with full plating r is the radius of gyration of the stiffener with full plating i is moment of inertia of stiffener with full plating z 0 is neutral axis height a is area of the cross section of the stiffened plate they are expressed as follow 6 λ a π r σ y e 7 r i a 8 i b t p 3 12 b t p z 0 t p 2 2 h w 3 t w 12 h w t w z 0 t p h w 2 2 b f t f 3 12 b f t f z 0 t p h w t f 2 2 9 z 0 b t p 2 2 h w t w t p h w 2 b f t f t p h w t f 2 a 10 a b t p h w t w b f t f fig 6 shows the relevant comparisons of the static ultimate strength of stiffened plate with simply supported edges between the empirical formulation and numerical method it can be seen that the results obtained from the nonlinear fe method agree well with the empirical formulation the error of the ultimate strength for these two methods was just 3 6 4 dynamic ultimate strength of stiffened plates a series of dynamic ultimate strength analyses are performed on the stiffened plate model under in plane compressive loading and lateral pressure based on nonlinear fe method 1 bay 1 span model with simply supported and clamped boundary conditions were also studied to compare with the present 1 2 1 1 2 span 1 2 1 1 2 bay model xu et al 2017 studied the ultimate strength of hull girder based on explicit dynamic analysis and the influence of loading time which depend on the wave period in this paper the dynamic ultimate strength of the stiffened plate derived from 10 000teu container ship under combined in plane slamming loading and lateral pressure were studied it is well known that the slamming loading usually has a very short duration with milliseconds order wang and guedes soares 2013 wang et al 2016 yang and wang 2017a yang and wang 2016 therefore eight different strain rates which range from 10 4s 1 to 1 4s 1 were adopted in the investigation on the dynamic ultimate strength of the stiffened plate the corresponding loading time range from 0 002s to 0 34s the influences of the strain rate boundary conditions and initial imperfections on the dynamic ultimate strength were studied in the following fig 7 shows the compressive loads versus axial end shortening curves of the stiffened plate at an average large level it can be found that the end shortening length of the reference point increase with the increase of the strain rates except for the case when ε 0 6s 1 due to the fact that the larger dynamic yield stress means the stiffened plate has a larger stiffness to resist deformation the reason why the shortening length for the case ε 0 6s 1 is larger than the case ε 0 8s 1 maybe the stress wave velocity v s for the case ε 0 8s 1 is just an integer multiple of the loading speed v s 1000v 0 and then lead to resonance response the dynamic ultimate strength of the stiffened plate corresponds quite closely to the static ultimate strength when the ε 0 003s 1 which implies that the dynamic characteristic of the stiffened plate is very unapparent when strain rate is enough small it can also be seen that the fluctuation of curves become more and more severe with the increase of strain rates this because the high frequency response of stiffened plate will be excited under high speed impact loading action it can be clearly seen that the dynamic ultimate strength of the stiffened plates increased with the increase of the loading speeds this because the strain rates of the material increase along with the loading speeds and then the larger strain rates usually lead to the larger dynamic yield stress the average stresses of the stiffened plate at the ultimate limit state against the strain rate are summarized in table 3 which shows that the stiffened plate with the initial imperfection at a severe level collapsed completely before yielding failure under quasi static compressive loading ε 0 003s 1 whether the stiffened plate loses carrying capacity before yielding or not depends on the strain rate and initial imperfection the influence of initial imperfections on the dynamic ultimate strength of the stiffened plate with eight different loading speeds is shown in fig 8 it can be clearly seen that the dynamic ultimate compressive loads increase with the increase of strain rates and it is insensitive to the strain rate when the ε 1 0s 1 the reason may be that the curve of dynamic constitutive relation will become smooth with the increase of the strain rate according to cowper symonds equation moreover the ratio of the dynamic ultimate strength ratio for the case ε 0 6 s 1 at a slight level initial imperfection to that at a severe initial imperfection is more than 1 45 times which shows the initial imperfections have an important influence on the dynamic ultimate strength of stiffened plates the ratios of the maximum dynamic ultimate strength to the static ultimate strength of the stiffened plate for three initial imperfections slight level average level and severe level are 1 756 1 863 and 1 893 respectively therefore it can be concluded that loading speed has an important influence on the ultimate strength of the stiffened plate so it is too conservative to assess the ultimate strength of ship plating under dynamic loads in terms of static ultimate strength criterion furthermore the larger initial imperfection results in the smaller dynamic ultimate strength it is worth noting that the results between slight level and average level are very close except for the case ε 0 6 fig 9 shows that the dynamic ultimate strength curves with different initial imperfection shapes the dynamic ultimate strength with the initial imperfection shape 1 is larger when ε 0 6 on the contrary it has a larger value for the initial imperfection shape 2 when ε 0 6 initial imperfection shapes have an apparent effect on the dynamic ultimate strength of stiffened plates so it will be useful to predict the dynamic ultimate strength accurately by measuring the initial imperfection shape induced by fabrication fig 10 shows the deformed shapes and von mises stress distributions of the stiffened plate at the ultimate limit state for two initial imperfections the maximum stress response at the ultimate limit state increases with the increase of strain rates it is found that the collapse modes of the stiffened plates with different initial imperfections are totally different for the stiffened plates with the imp 1 at three strain rates the collapse modes are local buckling of stiffener web after the collapse of plating mode iv however the collapse modes of the stiffened plate with imp 2 are overall collapse mode mode i and the higher order collapse modes will be activated with the increase of strain rates additionally the effects of different lateral pressure quantities on the ultimate strength were studied as shown in fig 11 for the static ultimate strength it is very apparent that the ultimate strength decreases with increased lateral pressure and the difference value between the maximum and minimum ultimate strength is 6 5 therefore lateral pressures play an important role in the static ultimate strength analysis of stiffened plates however the effects of the lateral pressure on the dynamic ultimate strength were negligible and dynamic ultimate strength of the stiffened plate has no obvious regularity to the lateral pressures the boundary conditions are also very important to the ultimate strength of the stiffened plate the three boundary restrained edges were discussed in this paper and the effects of these boundary conditions are shown in fig 12 as depicted in fig 12 the simply supported and clamped boundary condition has the smallest and the largest dynamic ultimate strength respectively moreover the dynamic ultimate strength of the stiffened plate for the extend model is located between simply supported and clamped boundary conditions it implies that by increasing the restriction in the supports the resistance ability against the stability of the stiffened plate increases for the static ultimate strength of the stiffened plate the results for clamped boundary condition compare well with the results of the extend model and the error between simply supported or clamped and the extend model is 13 7 1 8 therefore it is more realistic to compute the static ultimate strength of the outer bottom stiffened plate by adopting clamped boundary condition than simply supported boundary condition in terms of the dynamic ultimate strength analysis of the stiffened plate under in plane compressive loading although two simplified boundary conditions cannot represent the more realistic results it is better to adopt the clamped boundary condition for predicting the dynamic ultimate strength of the stiffened plate when simplified boundary conditions are adopted for simplicity and saving calculation time in the calculation of practical engineering problems it can also be found that the results for the three boundary conditions are very close when ε 1 2s 1 fig 13 compares the deformed shapes of the stiffened plates with three different boundary conditions it can be seen that the deformation of the plate under in plane dynamic loading grows to keep the same mode with the assumed initial imperfection shape and the higher order buckling modes will be activated when the strain rates increase the collapse modes for these stiffened plates are local buckling of stiffener web after collapse of plating mode iv fig 14 shows that the dynamic ultimate strength curves with varying structural dimensions all these curves have same change trend the results of the two stiffened plates with equally distributed stiffeners d2 and d3 are quite close while the stiffened plate with unevenly distributed stiffeners d1 had the largest ultimate strength results the longitudinal stiffener spacing b has a minimal impact on the ultimate strength of the stiffened plate with equally distributed stiffeners when the length of loading edges and the number of stiffeners is still the same however it is just the opposite for the stiffened plate with unevenly distributed stiffeners these results will be very useful for the strength optimization of stiffened plates fig 15 shows the deformed shapes and von mises stress distributions of the stiffened plate at the ultimate limit state varying the longitudinal stiffener spacing the maximum stress response at the ultimate limit state increases with the increase of strain rates it is found that the collapse modes between d1 and d2 are totally different however the stress response of d1and d2 are quite close this is the reason why these two stiffened plates have the same dynamic ultimate strength though the maximum stress response of the d1 is minimum the dynamic ultimate strength is largest among these stiffened plates because the mean stress of d1 at the ultimate limit state is larger than the other two stiffened plates 5 conclusions nonlinear fe method was used to calculate the dynamic ultimate strength of the outer ship bottom stiffened plate structures under in plane compressive loads with considering the effects of rotational restraints along edges the influences of initial imperfections and boundary conditions on the dynamic ultimate strength were discussed in detail a multitude of available results of the present study can be summarized as follows the dynamic ultimate compressive loads increase with the increase of strain rates the larger initial imperfection results in the smaller static and dynamic ultimate strength it is worth noting that the results between slight level and average level are very close except for the case ε 0 6 lateral pressures play an important role in the static ultimate strength analysis of stiffened plates on the contrary the effects of the lateral pressure on the dynamic ultimate strength can be negligible the dynamic ultimate strength derived from clamped boundary condition is closer to the results for the extend model the numerical results obtained in the present paper are very useful for the ultimate limit state of stiffened plates subjected to dynamic in plane compressive loads actually the loading speed cannot keep constant during the dynamic analysis process of the stiffened plate so in the future study the equivalent relationship between forced velocity loading and impact loading will be established to study the dynamic ultimate strength of ship plates more reasonably acknowledgements the work

synchronization range of vortex induced vibration viv of the structure u r is varied by changing the density of the material the force coefficients the frequency of shedding flapping are observed to be the function of g d and u r the positive vortices diffuses faster as g d decreases the skewness in the amplitude attained by the flapping filament on either side of the cylinder causes unsteady shedding of vortices filament flaps in frequency that is closer to its natural frequency at higher g d and at lower g d the frequency of flaps for all u r is similar for lower gap ratios 0 5 and 0 6 the modulations in flapping amplitude is observed the modulation is predominant as the u r increases during the growth and damping phase of the amplitudes in each modulation cycle the vortex shedding

frequency keywords cylinder flexible splitter plate ground effect vortex induced vibration fluid structure interaction 1 introduction flow past cylinder has been the area of interest for researchers because of its applications in engineering fields the alternate shedding of vortices causes the cylinder to excite due to pressure fluctuations these fluctuations are undesirable in industrial applications such as the pipeline or for the locomotion of insects they cause the body to vibrate at a particular frequency which causes fatigue these phenomena are extensively studied by many researchers and are briefly reviewed by sarpkaya 2004 and williamson and govardhan 2008 the methods of controlling the vortex shedding gained importance and have been studied using active and passive means splitter plate at the wake of the cylinder is one of the passive methods that efficiently modify the flow field by preventing the shear layer interaction at the trailing edge gozmen et al 2013 most of the literature that reports the effect of splitter plate on lift and drag coefficients are based on the reynolds number and the length of the plate the plate considered is rigid and non deformable under different conditions drag reduction and vortex suppression phenomena are reported sudhakar and vengadesan 2012 performed numerical studies on oscillating splitter plate which controls the flow when oscillated at low frequencies for stationary plate the length required is of five times the diameter of the cylinder inspired by nature the effect of the flexible splitter plate which aids locomotion is being studied simultaneously the effect of flexible fin is found to manipulate the vortex shedding because of its motion induced by the hydrodynamic loads on the plate the frequency of flapping of the plate depends on the natural frequency of the geometry and reynolds number of the flow this motion is studied to harvest energy as shown through experiments allen and smits 2001 numerical studies on flexible geometries are also conducted for a wide variety of parametric variations lee and you 2013 concluded that the effect of bending stiffness has a major effect on the hydrodynamic forces and shedding frequency wu et al 2014 reported that compared to rigid splitter plate of the flexible plate with low bending stiffness suppresses the shedding biologically flexible splitter plate or wing plays a major role in reducing the drag lacis et al 2014 concluded that the plate projection should be sufficiently short giving more area for the flow reversal teksin and yayla 2017 and teksin and yayla 2016 conducted experiments to analyse the behaviour of deformable splitter plate of different lengths understanding the effect of wall proximity is necessary for the field of ocean and aerospace industries many animals like fish swims near the wall to reduce the energy spent in moving wing in ground effect has already attracted many researchers because of the aerodynamic benefits gained when flying near the ground the ground effects on the isolated cylinder are reported by various literature lei et al 2000 concluded at higher gap ratio g d 1 the lift coefficient does not change significantly the lift coefficient increases as the distance from the wall decreases zhang and shi 2016 observed the same behaviour from cylinder with splitter plate near the moving wall akilli et al ozkan et al 2017 miau et al 1993 he et al 2017 and fu and rockwell 2005 have studied the flow control of circular cylinder near wall vortex induced vibration of cylinder vibrating near the wall are analysed by tham et al 2015 shaafi et al 2017 analysed the vortex phenomenon by numerically studying the behaviour of rotating cylinder near the ground recently flow past flexible plunging plate near the ground had been numerically studied by park et al 2017 and reported that the observed hydrodynamic benefits or penalties are not only due to ground effects but also due to the flexibility of the plate it is seen that deformable material has a significant impact on the flow parameters and flow structures but none of the literature has conducted studies on varying density the objective of the present study is to examine the effect of density of the deformable filament in the wake of the cylinder on the flow field the cylinder is kept at different wall proximities to observe the dynamic response of the plate and force coefficient the paper is arranged in the following manner the governing equations and numerical methodology are explained validation tests are carried out problem description and the results for different domain and grids independence tests are reported it is followed by results and discussion in section 6 and the concluding remarks 2

lagrangian eulerian approach is implemented for coupling fluid solid interface and for moving the mesh based on solid deformation 4 flow parameters and independence tests the problem is studied in the range of parameters provided in table 1 the reynolds number of the flow based on the diameter of the cylinder is 200 the parameters of interest are wall proximity g d and reduced velocity u r the u r is varied by changing the density of the splitter plate it can be noted that the elastic modulus can also influence the response of the structure but it is maintained as a constant to observe the response of structure due to density variation the reduced velocities are selected such that the vortex induced vibration synchronization range is appropriately captured 4 1 domain independence study in order to carry out the domain independence test upstream streamwise l s distance of 7 5d is fixed and downstream distance is varied from 25d to 35d table 2 a shows computed rms value of c d it is observed that the variation in the c d r m s is negligible between 30d and 35d hence it is fixed as 30d in the transverse direction distance l t is varied from 5d to 15d from table 2b c d r m s is compared and observed that 10d is reasonable hence the domain considered for further simulations as 30d and 10d 4 2 grid independence study 4 2 1 fluid domain unstructured grid is used to discretize the fluid domain the grid is generated based on the base size value h and it is uniform in the region enclosing the cylinder base sizes considered are 0 02d 0 01d and 0 005d table 3 consists of rms value lift coefficients the optimum grid size considered for the cases is 0 01d 4 2 2 structural domain a body force of sinusoidal function a cos 2 π f x is applied on the top of the beam where the x is a node on the solid body a is the amplitude of the force and f is the frequency of the forcing function and l 2 norm of the nodal displacement ζ y r m s in y direction is taken to perform the test the results are summarized in table 4 the changes in the l 2 norm is negligible when the grid size reduces from 0 01d 0 14d and it is chosen for discretizing the structural domain 5 validation 5 1 flow solver the numerical scheme for solving the navier stokes is benchmarked against the published literature shaafi et al 2017 on wake wall interactions of rotating cylinder the upstream distance of the cylinder is 8d and the ground distance g d is 1 5 the case chosen is stationary cylinder of zero rotation rate the r e number of the flow is 200 the force coefficients are given in the form of the table below the comparison suggests that the results agree well with the published results see table 5 5 2 fluid structure interaction the algorithm is validated against the literature by turek and hron 2006 the flow past a cylinder with flexible splitter plate in the wake is numerically simulated for the purpose of comparison the tip displacement in cross flow field direction is plotted against the literature the parameters considered for the simulation are listed in table 6 a parabolic velocity profile is imposed as the boundary condition at velocity inlet the domain size of 2 5d 0 41d is used both top and bottom wall are imposed of no slip boundary conditions cylinder s origin is placed at the distance of 2d from the velocity inlet and 2d from the top wall the grid is clustered near the cylinder with the plate of size 0 0375d for csd simulations 1000 elements are used fig 2 shows the time history of the tip displacement of the plate predicted by the present simulation where ζ y represents the tip displacement in y direction non dimensionalized by the diameter of the cylinder d fig 3 shows the alternating vortex shedding over the cylinder and the corresponding plate response at maximum positive and negative tip displacement once again the foregoing result suggests the satisfactory validation of fluid structure interaction simulation 6 results and discussion a two dimensional numerical study on flow past a cylinder with flexible filament is investigated for different wall proximities and for different reduced velocities the parameters of fluid flow and solid properties are provided in table 1 reduced velocity is defined as u f n d where u is the free stream velocity f n is the natural frequency of the filament and d is the diameter of the cylinder as discussed earlier the r e is kept constant throughout the study and the natural frequency f n is varied for the purpose of changing the u r the natural frequency is inversely proportional to the density of the material as density increases the natural frequency falls and reduced velocity increases higher the reduced velocity the material is very heavy and at lower reduced velocity the material is light 6 1 force coefficients the coefficients and flow field are reported for flow past cylinder with a flexible filament for different wall proximities in fig 4 a and b to examine the response of the filament and force coefficients different values of u r 3 6 are used the mean value of the lift coefficient c l is observed to be similar to that of zhang et al 2017 in unbounded flow the c l is expected to be symmetric in order to bring out the variation of c l and c d across the entire range of g d and u r these are plotted in fig 4a and b against u r from fig 4a the cylinder is observed to experience mean positive lift force c l i e it is pushed away from the wall for u r of 3 for all wall proximities except for g d 0 5 and gradually decreases and becomes negative as the u r increases this asymmetricity gradually tends to disappear as the u r exceeds 5 the mean lift coefficient is high for intermediate g d of 1 5 followed by that for 2 and 2 5 the g d of 0 5 has the lowest c l across all u r similarly from fig 4b mean drag force c d is minimum for low u r g d of 2 5 has the minimum c d for u r till 4 5 which is followed by g d of 0 5 at g d 0 8 for all u r experience maximum c d similar to asymmetricity in c l there exists a corresponding asymmetricity in ζ y fig 5 gives the variation of lift and displacement for u r 6 5 at all g d in order to explain the above the time history of ζ y tip displacement in y direction is non dimensionalized with diameter of the cylinder and c l are plotted in fig 5 6 2 vortex shedding pattern vorticity contours for different wall proximities are plotted in fig 6 to understand the physics behind the interaction between proximity and lift generation typical ka rma n vortex street is seen for higher wall proximities of g d and irregular shedding for the intermediate distance of 1 1 5 the asymmetricity in the force coefficient because of the proximity is reflected in the shedding of vortices complete suppression of positive vortices are observed for g d of 0 5 0 8 in all cases the shedding frequency is observed to be in synchronization with flapping frequency the distance between two alternate vortices are different because of the asymmetricity in c l this can be visualized in the vorticity plots for g d of 0 5 negative vortices are formed on the wall near the cylinder in the downstream because of the adverse pressure gradient this vortices roll on the wall moving downstream for g d of 0 6 this secondary vortices gets diffused after moving some distance in the downstream as the wall proximity increases to 0 6 0 8 or 1 the formation and destruction of secondary vortices happen instantaneously and for wall proximity of 1 5 there are no formation of secondary vortices due to the interaction of the wall boundary layer with the wake structures at the g d of 0 5 and 0 6 the flapping of the filament has modulation in vortex shedding frequency when the flapping amplitude of the filament is relatively large the negative vortex shed from the filament remains parallel to the wall and the secondary vortex moves downstream during lock out cycle the negative vortices shed from the filament tend to move towards the wall in downstream and get diffused this is presented in fig 7 for g d of 0 5 for intermediate g d of 1 and 1 5 the vortex shed is deflected from the wall and moves obliquely for g d of 2 the alternative vortices are shed forming a chain of vortices with alternating signs at g d 2 5 the symmetric pair of vortex is shed the shedding pattern remains similar for all u r but the frequency is observed to be reducing as u r increases as stated earlier the natural frequency reduces as u r increases so the vortex shedding frequency is dominated by the u r at higher g d for g d of 0 5 1 the shedding frequency is affected by the wall proximity and the flow is observed to be controlled compared to the higher g d for the same u r 6 3 filament dynamics the asymmetricity in the c l due to wall proximity is reflected in the flapping amplitude of the filament for higher wall proximities where the positive vortex formation is least interfered by the wall amplitude attained by filament on either side of the cylinder is relatively higher the tip displacement ζ y is small for lower wall proximities because of the suppression of positive vortices in order to visualize the asymmetricity the instantaneous positions of the filament over a full cycle of flapping are brought out in fig 8 lock in is referred when the amplitude of the flapping filament reaches the maximum displacement across all u r for a particular g d as can be observed from fig 9 lock in across different g d occurs at different u r for higher g d the lock in occurs at u r of 5 and for g d 0 6 lock in occurs at u r of 3 for intermediate g d it falls at u r of 4 g d of 0 5 is observed to have modulations in flapping amplitude because of the instabilities due to boundary layer interaction lock in regime gradually shifts from u r of 3 as the g d increases the lock in regime is observed to be broader as g d increases i e at g d of 2 5 the rise and fall of ζ y value is gradual compared to g d 0 5 this is because of the flow being controlled by wall and suppression of positive vortices the strouhal number s t in fig 10 indicates the significant shift in the shedding frequency the loci of tip displacement are plotted for u r 4 at g d of 0 5 0 6 and 2 in fig 11 it can be observed that the filament is extended beyond its length when the negative vortices are shed for g d where the wall effects are predominant this extension gradually reduces as the wall proximity increases at g d of 0 5 the filament vibrates in constant amplitude at u r of 3 as the reduced velocity increases there are modulations in time trace of the amplitude of flapping the filament gradually increases in amplitude and then falls at u r of 4 the modulation appears to be symmetrical i e the rise and fall of the amplitude remains similar with respect to time fig 12 gives the time traces of lift drag and tip displacement in y the time trace for g d of 0 6 looks similar but the amplitude modulation starts from u r 5 and remains symmetrical about the peak the drag and displacement are in the same phase whereas the lift is in the phase difference of 180 more insight of the filament dynamics could be derived by investigating the time traces of ζ y of the filament c l and c d as shown in fig 12 in order to save space only the typical time traces are produced in the above mentioned figure at g d of 0 6 u r of 6 5 in fig 12a g d of 0 5 u r of 5 5 and 6 5 in fig 12b and c it is evident that there is clearly modulated responses in case of g d less than 0 5 at the synchronization region while the magnitude of modulation is barely appreciable at g d of 0 6 it comes out very predominantly for g d of 0 5 referring to the time traces of ζ y the multiple frequency components as observed in the amplitude of spectra is clearly brought out in fig 13 there appears to be a strong lock in at partial anti nodes and lock out at nodes the frequency of lock in and lock out is about 1 10 t h of the filament s frequency this is noted in frequency spectra also it can also be observed that there is a significant increase in c d at the time of lock in at the same time when this occurs there is also an increase in c l as it amplifies from minimum during lock out cycle these effects are observed in g d of 0 5 the modulation in the force coefficients are clearly reflected in the frequency plot from g d of 0 8 the maximum amplitude attained by the flapping filament remains constant from fig 13a and b the peak occurs at the non dimensional frequency ratio of 1 i e natural frequency and flapping frequency are same 7 conclusions the study has analysed the effects of wall proximity on the flexible filament for different reduced velocities the filament is fixed at the leading edge and free to flap because of the hydrodynamic loads along the downstream length the reynolds number of the flow is 200 the non dimensionalized wall proximity g d is varied from 0 5 to 2 5 and reduced velocity is varied from 3 to 6 to capture the synchronization range appropriately there is asymmetry in the c l and it tends to reduce as u r increases the shedding frequency for higher g d is closer to the natural frequency of the filament at lower g d the frequency for all u r remains almost similar variation in lock in regime for different g d are observed at higher g d lock in regime is broader and for lower g d lock in is narrow skewness in the amplitude attained by the filament on either side of the cylinder is observed because of the proximity this reflects in the shedding of alternate vortices in the single flapping cycle there are secondary vortices formed due to adverse pressure gradient downstream on the wall which increases in magnitude as g d reduces at g d of 0 5 there are modulations in flapping amplitude because of the wall boundary layer interaction with the filament the modulation appears to be symmetric for u r 3 and gradually becomes asymmetric as u r increases the drag and lift grow during lock out cycle and attains peak at lock in cycle

synchronization range of vortex induced vibration viv of the structure u r is varied by changing the density of the material the force coefficients the frequency of shedding flapping are observed to be the function of g d and u r the positive vortices diffuses faster as g d decreases the skewness in the amplitude attained by the flapping filament on either side of the cylinder causes unsteady shedding of vortices filament flaps in frequency that is closer to its natural frequency at higher g d and at lower g d the frequency of flaps for all u r is similar for lower gap ratios 0 5 and 0 6 the modulations in flapping amplitude is observed the modulation is predominant as the u r increases during the growth and damping phase of the amplitudes in each modulation cycle the vortex shedding is observed to be oblique towards the wall the filament flaps in single mode shape the frequency of the flapping depends on the u r and g d the frequency of the flapping is in resonance with shedding frequency keywords cylinder flexible splitter plate ground effect vortex induced vibration fluid structure interaction 1 introduction flow past cylinder has been the area of interest for researchers because of its applications in engineering fields the alternate shedding of vortices causes the cylinder to excite due to pressure fluctuations these fluctuations are undesirable in industrial applications such as the pipeline or for the locomotion of insects they cause the body to vibrate at a particular frequency which causes fatigue these phenomena are extensively studied by many researchers and are briefly reviewed by sarpkaya 2004 and williamson and govardhan 2008 the methods of controlling the vortex shedding gained importance and have been studied using active and passive means splitter plate at the wake of the cylinder is one of the passive methods that efficiently modify the flow field by preventing the shear layer interaction at the trailing edge gozmen et al 2013 most of the literature that reports the effect of splitter plate on lift and drag coefficients are based on the reynolds number and the length of the plate the plate considered is rigid and non deformable under different conditions drag reduction and vortex suppression phenomena are reported sudhakar and vengadesan 2012 performed numerical studies on oscillating splitter plate which controls the flow when oscillated at low frequencies for stationary plate the length required is of five times the diameter of the cylinder inspired by nature the effect of the flexible splitter plate which aids locomotion is being studied simultaneously the effect of flexible fin is found to manipulate the vortex shedding because of its motion induced by the hydrodynamic loads on the plate the frequency of flapping of the plate depends on the natural frequency of the geometry and reynolds number of the flow this motion is studied to harvest energy as shown through experiments allen and smits 2001 numerical studies on flexible geometries are also conducted for a wide variety of parametric variations lee and you 2013 concluded that the effect of bending stiffness has a major effect on the hydrodynamic forces and shedding frequency wu et al 2014 reported that compared to rigid splitter plate of the flexible plate with low bending stiffness suppresses the shedding biologically flexible splitter plate or wing plays a major role in reducing the drag lacis et al 2014 concluded that the plate projection should be sufficiently short giving more area for the flow reversal teksin and yayla 2017 and teksin and yayla 2016 conducted experiments to analyse the behaviour of deformable splitter plate of different lengths understanding the effect of wall proximity is necessary for the field of ocean and aerospace industries many animals like fish swims near the wall to reduce the energy spent in moving wing in ground effect has already attracted many researchers because of the aerodynamic benefits gained when flying near the ground the ground effects on the isolated cylinder are reported by various literature lei et al 2000 concluded at higher gap ratio g d 1 the lift coefficient does not change significantly the lift coefficient increases as the distance from the wall decreases zhang and shi 2016 observed the same behaviour from cylinder with splitter plate near the moving wall akilli et al ozkan et al 2017 miau et al 1993 he et al 2017 and fu and rockwell 2005 have studied the flow control of circular cylinder near wall vortex induced vibration of cylinder vibrating near the wall are analysed by tham et al 2015 shaafi et al 2017 analysed the vortex phenomenon by numerically studying the behaviour of rotating cylinder near the ground recently flow past flexible plunging plate near the ground had been numerically studied by park et al 2017 and reported that the observed hydrodynamic benefits or penalties are not only due to ground effects but also due to the flexibility of the plate it is seen that deformable material has a significant impact on the flow parameters and flow structures but none of the literature has conducted studies on varying density the objective of the present study is to examine the effect of density of the deformable filament in the wake of the cylinder on the flow field the cylinder is kept at different wall proximities to observe the dynamic response of the plate and force coefficient the paper is arranged in the following manner the governing equations and numerical methodology are explained validation tests are carried out problem description and the results for different domain and grids independence tests are reported it is followed by results and discussion in section 6 and the concluding remarks 2 problem description the cylinder with a flexible filament attached at the wake is placed near the ground fig 1 shows the schematic diagram of the geometry concerned with computational domain and

lagrangian eulerian approach is implemented for coupling fluid solid interface and for moving the mesh based on solid deformation 4 flow parameters and independence tests the problem is studied in the range of parameters provided in table 1 the reynolds number of the flow based on the diameter of the cylinder is 200 the parameters of interest are wall proximity g d and reduced velocity u r the u r is varied by changing the density of the splitter plate it can be noted that the elastic modulus can also influence the response of the structure but it is maintained as a constant to observe the response of structure due to density variation the reduced velocities are selected such that the vortex induced vibration synchronization range is appropriately captured 4 1 domain independence study in order to carry out the domain independence test upstream streamwise l s distance of 7 5d is fixed and downstream distance is varied from 25d to 35d table 2 a shows computed rms value of c d it is observed that the variation in the c d r m s is negligible between 30d and 35d hence it is fixed as 30d in the transverse direction distance l t is varied from 5d to 15d from table 2b c d r m s is compared and observed that 10d is reasonable hence the domain considered for further simulations as 30d and 10d 4 2 grid independence study 4 2 1 fluid domain unstructured grid is used to discretize the fluid domain the grid is generated based on the base size value h and it is uniform in the region enclosing the cylinder base sizes considered are 0 02d 0 01d and 0 005d table 3 consists of rms value lift coefficients the optimum grid size considered for the cases is 0 01d 4 2 2 structural domain a body force of sinusoidal function a cos 2 π f x is applied on the top of the beam where the x is a node on the solid body a is the amplitude of the force and f is the frequency of the forcing function and l 2 norm of the nodal displacement ζ y r m s in y direction is taken to perform the test the results are summarized in table 4 the changes in the l 2 norm is negligible when the grid size reduces from 0 01d 0 14d and it is chosen for discretizing the structural domain 5 validation 5 1 flow solver the numerical scheme for solving the navier stokes is benchmarked against the published literature shaafi et al 2017 on wake wall interactions of rotating cylinder the upstream distance of the cylinder is 8d and the ground distance g d is 1 5 the case chosen is stationary cylinder of zero rotation rate the r e number of the flow is 200 the force coefficients are given in the form of the table below the comparison suggests that the results agree well with the published results see table 5 5 2 fluid structure interaction the algorithm is validated against the literature by turek and hron 2006 the flow past a cylinder with flexible splitter plate in the wake is numerically simulated for the purpose of comparison the tip displacement in cross flow field direction is plotted against the literature the parameters considered for the simulation are listed in table 6 a parabolic velocity profile is imposed as the boundary condition at velocity inlet the domain size of 2 5d 0 41d is used both top and bottom wall are imposed of no slip boundary conditions cylinder s origin is placed at the distance of 2d from the velocity inlet and 2d from the top wall the grid is clustered near the cylinder with the plate of size 0 0375d for csd simulations 1000 elements are used fig 2 shows the time history of the tip displacement of the plate predicted by the present simulation where ζ y represents the tip displacement in y direction non dimensionalized by the diameter of the cylinder d fig 3 shows the alternating vortex shedding over the cylinder and the corresponding plate response at maximum positive and negative tip displacement once again the foregoing result suggests the satisfactory validation of fluid structure interaction simulation 6 results and discussion a two dimensional numerical study on flow past a cylinder with flexible filament is investigated for different wall proximities and for different reduced velocities the parameters of fluid flow and solid properties are provided in table 1 reduced velocity is defined as u f n d where u is the free stream velocity f n is the natural frequency of the filament and d is the diameter of the cylinder as discussed earlier the r e is kept constant throughout the study and the natural frequency f n is varied for the purpose of changing the u r the natural frequency is inversely proportional to the density of the material as density increases the natural frequency falls and reduced velocity increases higher the reduced velocity the material is very heavy and at lower reduced velocity the material is light 6 1 force coefficients the coefficients and flow field are reported for flow past cylinder with a flexible filament for different wall proximities in fig 4 a and b to examine the response of the filament and force coefficients different values of u r 3 6 are used the mean value of the lift coefficient c l is observed to be similar to that of zhang et al 2017 in unbounded flow the c l is expected to be symmetric in order to bring out the variation of c l and c d across the entire range of g d and u r these are plotted in fig 4a and b against u r from fig 4a the cylinder is observed to experience mean positive lift force c l i e it is pushed away from the wall for u r of 3 for all wall proximities except for g d 0 5 and gradually decreases and becomes negative as the u r increases this asymmetricity gradually tends to disappear as the u r exceeds 5 the mean lift coefficient is high for intermediate g d of 1 5 followed by that for 2 and 2 5 the g d of 0 5 has the lowest c l across all u r similarly from fig 4b mean drag force c d is minimum for low u r g d of 2 5 has the minimum c d for u r till 4 5 which is followed by g d of 0 5 at g d 0 8 for all u r experience maximum c d similar to asymmetricity in c l there exists a corresponding asymmetricity in ζ y fig 5 gives the variation of lift and displacement for u r 6 5 at all g d in order to explain the above the time history of ζ y tip displacement in y direction is non dimensionalized with diameter of the cylinder and c l are plotted in fig 5 6 2 vortex shedding pattern vorticity contours for different wall proximities are plotted in fig 6 to understand the physics behind the interaction between proximity and lift generation typical ka rma n vortex street is seen for higher wall proximities of g d and irregular shedding for the intermediate distance of 1 1 5 the asymmetricity in the force coefficient because of the proximity is reflected in the shedding of vortices complete suppression of positive vortices are observed for g d of 0 5 0 8 in all cases the shedding frequency is observed to be in synchronization with flapping frequency the distance between two alternate vortices are different because of the asymmetricity in c l this can be visualized in the vorticity plots for g d of 0 5 negative vortices are formed on the wall near the cylinder in the downstream because of the adverse pressure gradient this vortices roll on the wall moving downstream for g d of 0 6 this secondary vortices gets diffused after moving some distance in the downstream as the wall proximity increases to 0 6 0 8 or 1 the formation and destruction of secondary vortices happen instantaneously and for wall proximity of 1 5 there are no formation of secondary vortices due to the interaction of the wall boundary layer with the wake structures at the g d of 0 5 and 0 6 the flapping of the filament has modulation in vortex shedding frequency when the flapping amplitude of the filament is relatively large the negative vortex shed from the filament remains parallel to the wall and the secondary vortex moves downstream during lock out cycle the negative vortices shed from the filament tend to move towards the wall in downstream and get diffused this is presented in fig 7 for g d of 0 5 for intermediate g d of 1 and 1 5 the vortex shed is deflected from the wall and moves obliquely for g d of 2 the alternative vortices are shed forming a chain of vortices with alternating signs at g d 2 5 the symmetric pair of vortex is shed the shedding pattern remains similar for all u r but the frequency is observed to be reducing as u r increases as stated earlier the natural frequency reduces as u r increases so the vortex shedding frequency is dominated by the u r at higher g d for g d of 0 5 1 the shedding frequency is affected by the wall proximity and the flow is observed to be controlled compared to the higher g d for the same u r 6 3 filament dynamics the asymmetricity in the c l due to wall proximity is reflected in the flapping amplitude of the filament for higher wall proximities where the positive vortex formation is least interfered by the wall amplitude attained by filament on either side of the cylinder is relatively higher the tip displacement ζ y is small for lower wall proximities because of the suppression of positive vortices in order to visualize the asymmetricity the instantaneous positions of the filament over a full cycle of flapping are brought out in fig 8 lock in is referred when the amplitude of the flapping filament reaches the maximum displacement across all u r for a particular g d as can be observed from fig 9 lock in across different g d occurs at different u r for higher g d the lock in occurs at u r of 5 and for g d 0 6 lock in occurs at u r of 3 for intermediate g d it falls at u r of 4 g d of 0 5 is observed to have modulations in flapping amplitude because of the instabilities due to boundary layer interaction lock in regime gradually shifts from u r of 3 as the g d increases the lock in regime is observed to be broader as g d increases i e at g d of 2 5 the rise and fall of ζ y value is gradual compared to g d 0 5 this is because of the flow being controlled by wall and suppression of positive vortices the strouhal number s t in fig 10 indicates the significant shift in the shedding frequency the loci of tip displacement are plotted for u r 4 at g d of 0 5 0 6 and 2 in fig 11 it can be observed that the filament is extended beyond its length when the negative vortices are shed for g d where the wall effects are predominant this extension gradually reduces as the wall proximity increases at g d of 0 5 the filament vibrates in constant amplitude at u r of 3 as the reduced velocity increases there are modulations in time trace of the amplitude of flapping the filament gradually increases in amplitude and then falls at u r of 4 the modulation appears to be symmetrical i e the rise and fall of the amplitude remains similar with respect to time fig 12 gives the time traces of lift drag and tip displacement in y the time trace for g d of 0 6 looks similar but the amplitude modulation starts from u r 5 and remains symmetrical about the peak the drag and displacement are in the same phase whereas the lift is in the phase difference of 180 more insight of the filament dynamics could be derived by investigating the time traces of ζ y of the filament c l and c d as shown in fig 12 in order to save space only the typical time traces are produced in the above mentioned figure at g d of 0 6 u r of 6 5 in fig 12a g d of 0 5 u r of 5 5 and 6 5 in fig 12b and c it is evident that there is clearly modulated responses in case of g d less than 0 5 at the synchronization region while the magnitude of modulation is barely appreciable at g d of 0 6 it comes out very predominantly for g d of 0 5 referring to the time traces of ζ y the multiple frequency components as observed in the amplitude of spectra is clearly brought out in fig 13 there appears to be a strong lock in at partial anti nodes and lock out at nodes the frequency of lock in and lock out is about 1 10 t h of the filament s frequency this is noted in frequency spectra also it can also be observed that there is a significant increase in c d at the time of lock in at the same time when this occurs there is also an increase in c l as it amplifies from minimum during lock out cycle these effects are observed in g d of 0 5 the modulation in the force coefficients are clearly reflected in the frequency plot from g d of 0 8 the maximum amplitude attained by the flapping filament remains constant from fig 13a and b the peak occurs at the non dimensional frequency ratio of 1 i e natural frequency and flapping frequency are same 7 conclusions the study has analysed the effects of wall proximity on the flexible filament for different reduced velocities the filament is fixed at the leading edge and free to flap because of the hydrodynamic loads along the downstream length the reynolds number of the flow is 200 the non dimensionalized wall proximity g d is varied from 0 5 to 2 5 and reduced velocity is varied from 3 to 6 to capture the synchronization range appropriately there is asymmetry in the c l and it tends to reduce as u r increases the shedding frequency for higher g d is closer to the natural frequency of the filament at lower g d the frequency for all u r remains almost similar variation in lock in regime for different g d are observed at higher g d lock in regime is broader and for lower g d lock in is narrow skewness in the amplitude attained by the filament on either side of the cylinder is observed because of the proximity this reflects in the shedding of alternate vortices in the single flapping cycle there are secondary vortices formed due to adverse pressure gradient downstream on the wall which increases in magnitude as g d reduces at g d of 0 5 there are modulations in flapping amplitude because of the wall boundary layer interaction with the filament the modulation appears to be symmetric for u r 3 and gradually becomes asymmetric as u r increases the drag and lift grow during lock out cycle and attains peak at lock in cycle 
23419,estimating the space time characteristics of a sea state is of crucial importance to a number of engineering applications such as the ones involving three dimensional waves interacting with marine structures in this context developing a technique that allows extrapolating information about the wave field utilizing only a relatively small number of records is highly impactful as it allows minimizing the use of expensive and sophisticated measurement techniques in this paper a compressive sampling cs based technique is developed for extrapolating free surface displacement data the technique relies on a directional spectrum compatible sparse representation in conjunction with formulating and solving an l1 norm optimization problem further the accuracy of the developed technique is significantly enhanced via the use of an adaptive basis re weighting procedure pertinent numerical examples demonstrate that the technique is capable of reconstructing the time history of a free surface displacement record successfully while capturing the main features of the target frequency spectrum and of the cross correlation function satisfactorily keywords compressive sampling sparse representation adaptive basis random wave field directional spectrum 1 introduction determining the spatial characteristics of a sea state is pivotal for ensuring that marine structures operate safely when subjected to rare extreme events for instance commonly utilized large body structures such as breakwaters both fixed and floating are excited by wave fields exhibiting a well defined spatial configuration in case of extreme events isaacson and nwogu 1987 boccotti 2014 that must be accounted for to prevent structural failures oumeraci 1994 another relevant example pertains to the emerging field of wave energy converters where single point buoy like energy harvesters are aimed to be installed in arrays with a specified spatial distribution in this context a given array is typically regarded as one system providing the grid network with electrical power therefore determining the response of all harvesters simultaneously is of significant importance to optimizing the performance of both the energy harvesters and the electrical grid folley and whittaker 2009 a final example relates to the field of sea wave statistics recent research work fedele et al 2009 2011 naess and batsevych 2010 fedele 2012 romolo and arena 2015 romolo et al 2016 demonstrated that conventional time domain analyses underestimate real sea wave statistics in space time domain and thus introduce unsafe input data in the design process in this regard knowledge of spatial data is clearly indispensable for estimating the appropriate design wave height to be adopted in the design of a marine structure a number of instruments methods have been developed for quantifying sea state spatial characteristics such as wave gauges ultrasonic instruments wave buoys synthetic aperture radar schulz stellenfleth and lehner 2004 li et al 2010 satellites chelton et al 2001 and variational stereo cameras gallego et al 2011 fedele et al 2013 wave gauges and ultrasonic instruments can be used for retrieving information about the frequency spectrum or in case of multiple sensors about the directional spectrum of the free surface displacement similar information is provided by individual wave buoys via acceleration data post processing tucker 1989 these data are utilized for acquiring only local information free surface data at a certain point in the time domain thus they cannot be used for obtaining space time information unless affording the high cost associated with the installation of a quite large number of instruments over a certain area radars and satellites allow covering quite large areas but they are unavoidably affected by limited resolution when it comes to relatively small spatial scales to overcome the above limitations stereo wave imaging has been proposed by the implementation of variational stereo cameras benetazzo et al 2015 these techniques involve the use of two or more cameras recording free surface images over a certain area which are post processed via 3 d reconstruction algorithms for recovering measurements of the free surface displacement in this context the main drawback of the technique relates to the significant processing power required this has an impact on the quality of the reconstruction algorithms that are designed considering a trade off between speed and accuracy further an additional drawback relates to the occasional inability to record some areas for instance the occurrence of a large wave crest may impede a given camera to have visual contact with a part of the wave field and thus the stereo technique cannot reconstruct the associated portion of the wave field therefore the record shows small holes in the measured wave field gallego et al 2011 this paper addresses the problem of extrapolating the time history of the free surface displacement at a certain location x j y j given recorded time histories at various other different known locations x i y i the solution to this problem can be regarded as a tool for overtaking some of the limitations associated with the aforementioned methodologies for example given the free surface data recorded by few ultrasonic probes placed at relatively distant locations we may determine free surface data at other locations without the need of several expensive sensors another example relates to the variational stereo technique given a successfully recovered time history we may extrapolate information pertaining to the holes directly from the already available data at no additional cost in terms of camera requirements the technique developed in the paper is based on compressive sampling cs ideas in conjunction with sparse representations cs was first proposed in the field of seismology by claerbout and muir 1973 and was recently revitalized due to the results of candes et al 2006a candes and tao 2006 and donoho 2006 see also candes and wakin 2008 candes and wakin 2008 which contributed extensively to establishing a rigorous mathematical foundation for cs their results fostered cs applications to quite diverse disciplines qaisar et al 2013 such as radar imaging baraniuk and steeghs 2007 face recognition qiao et al 2010 and magnetic resonance image reconstruction trzasko and manduca 2009 civil engineering applications have been proposed as well for instance the structural health monitoring community has exploited cs to reduce the number of data required for monitoring and assessing the damage of civil infrastructures huang et al 2014 di ianni et al 2015 tau siesakul et al 2015 wang and hao 2015 yang and nagarajaiah 2015 zou et al 2015 klis and chatzi 2017 further comerford et al 2014 2016 and zhang et al 2017a 2017b demonstrated that cs is effective also for reconstructing signals describing random environmental processes such as winds earthquakes and sea waves which are characterized by a relatively small number of dominant frequencies specifically they developed a technique for determining the power spectral density function of a signal either stationary or non stationary subject to missing data in the time domain and showed that power spectra can be successfully estimated even in cases of highly limited data even up to 80 missing data for some cases although cs has already revolutionized the signal processing field the ocean engineering community has neglected so far the capabilities of cs in this context the first applications were proposed by bayındır 2015 2016a b that utilized cs for conducting numerical simulations of nonlinear gravity waves and for the early identification of crossing rough seas while laface et al 2017 proposed the technique for reconstructing free surface data in time domain in the following sections a cs technique is developed for reconstructing a wave field based on a given set of recorded data the technique involves a relatively sparse representation compatible with a certain directional spectrum in conjunction with appropriate l1 norm minimization algorithms it is demonstrated that the main features of frequency spectra and spatial cross correlations are preserved during the extrapolation it is noted that concepts and ideas developed in comerford et al 2016 are extended herein to account for the significantly more sophisticated case of directional spectrum whereas it is demonstrated that an adaptation of the iterative procedure enhancement proposed by comerford et al 2014 2017 is particularly beneficial to the herein considered numerical examples 2 overview on stochastic process representation of a sea state this section reviews in a concise manner a typical stochastic process representation used in the context of linear water wave mechanics for describing the free surface displacement in an undisturbed wave field next it introduces the main statistical quantities involved in the description of a random wave field a stationary homogeneous gaussian random wave field is represented by the equation ochi 2005 1 η x y t i 1 n a i cos k i y cos θ i k i x sin θ i ω i t ε i where η x y t is the free surface displacement calculated at a certain location x y at a given time instant t a i are wave amplitudes ω i are frequencies such that ω i ω j if i j θ i are wave directions k i are wave numbers and ε i are random phase angles uniformly distributed over the interval 0 ε i 2π the wave numbers are directly related to the frequencies ω i specifically in deep waters they are calculated as mei et al 2005 2 k i ω i 2 g g being the acceleration due to gravity eq 1 involves the superposition of a large number n of regular waves each having a certain frequency and direction however their amplitudes are related to ω i and θ i via the directional spectrum s ω θ according to the relation 3 s ω θ δ ω δ θ i 1 2 a i 2 for ω ω i ω δ ω and θ θ i θ δ θ in this regard note that the frequency spectrum e ω of the process is associated with the directional spectrum 3 by the equation 4 e ω π π s ω θ d θ the statistical characteristics of the free surface displacement are directly estimated from the directional spectrum ochi 2005 boccotti 2014 specifically the significant wave height h s is given by 5 h s 4 0 π π s ω θ d θ d ω where it is recognized that the quantity under the square root is the variance of the free surface displacement process and the spatial cross correlation is 6 c x y τ e η x y t η x x y y t τ e being the mathematical expectation operator x and y being space lags and τ being a time lag in this context it is seen that c 00 τ is the auto correlation function and c 00 0 is the variance of the free surface displacement process the cross correlation 6 is readily calculated from the directional spectrum via the equation 7 c x y τ 0 π π s ω θ cos k y cos θ k x sin θ ω τ d θ d ω 3 compressive sampling the celebrated shannon s theorem states that the sampling rate of a signal must be at least twice the maximum frequency present in the signal shannon 1949 cs allows recovering signals even in case of undersampling that is even if the sampling rate is smaller than the nyquist rate in this section the fundamental cs assumptions and conditions sparsity incoherence and restricted isometry property are reviewed for completeness next the optimization problem involved in the extrapolation of free surface data is formulated in conjunction with an adaptive iterative procedure for enhancing the accuracy of the extrapolated signal 3 1 sparsity incoherence and restricted isometry property many signals associated with natural phenomena such as sea wave displacements can be represented via a convenient basis with much fewer coefficients than the ones required by the shannon nyquist rate in this regard consider a free surface displacement time history expanded as 8 η t i 1 n a i t z i where a i are the components of an orthonormal basis and z i are the coefficient sequences obtained by projecting η in the a i space the free surface displacement has a sparse representation if several of the z i coefficients have adequately small values and thus can be disregarded for its reconstruction once the coefficients are identified via appropriate optimization algorithms sparsity allows pursuing efficient data compression and statistical estimation comerford et al 2016 the choice of the basis is guided by the property of incoherence specifically cs is pursued by considering that the sampling domain and the sparse transform domain have a high degree of incoherence for instance regarding the fourier basis spikes in the frequency domain correspond to sinusoids in the time domain and vice versa this pair is maximally incoherent as a single coefficient characterizing the signal in the transform domain corresponds to a harmonic signal spanning the entire length of the sampling domain next the robustness of cs is guaranteed by the restricted isometry property rip candes and tao 2005 the sampling matrix a satisfies rip if there exists a constant δ k such that 9 1 δ k z l 2 2 a z l 2 2 1 δ k z l 2 2 for every vector z z 1 z 2 z n with at least k non zero values this property ensures that z cannot be in the null space of a or equivalently that any matrix composed of k randomly selected columns of a should have full rank and be nearly orthonormal to demonstrate that rip holds for a given matrix a is np hard candes et al 2006b however for some matrices such as gaussian random matrices fornasier and rauhut 2011 rip holds with a high probability 3 2 signal reconstruction by l1 norm minimization consider n free surface displacement time histories each composed by n samples available at certain locations x i y i next the objective is to extrapolate and determine time histories at arbitrary m distinct points x j y j for this purpose define η the nn 1 column vector containing the known samples of the free surface displacement and a the nn n n m sampling matrix then the measurement vector z considered sparse is determined by solving the problem 10 η a z eq 10 constitutes an underdetermined problem with infinite solutions therefore an additional constraint is imposed with the objective of determining a unique solution that is as sparse as possible it is known that the sparsest solution occurs when the l0 norm of z is minimized however this optimization problem is non convex with no known exact solution candes et al 2006a instead a known solution is available by minimizing the l2 norm of z in this context it can be readily shown that 11 min z l 2 a t a a t 1 η this solution minimizes z in a mean square sense but in general does not lead to a sparse solution a convenient alternative to these constraints is given by the minimization of the l1 norm indeed l1 norm still promotes sparsity and in addition gives rise to a convex optimization problem that can be solved for instance by a gradient based optimization method stanković et al 2012 in this context the optimization problem is recast in the linear programming form 12 min z l 1 subject to η az considering the fact that z is usually only approximately sparse and that some noise is always included in the computed values eq 12 takes the form 13 min z l 1 subject to a z η l 2 e where e denotes a tolerance value this modification has the effect of applying intervals to the solution further promoting sparsity 3 3 accuracy enhancement via an adaptive iterative procedure as demonstrated in comerford et al 2014 eq 12 or eq 13 is rather straightforward to apply however this kind of treatment comes with certain limitations one potential drawback relates to the significant computational effort required in case of large amounts of recorded data the second issue relates to the fact that the reconstructed free surface spectrum may occasionally contain spurious large peaks at unanticipated frequency values this situation occurs specifically when the number of available records is small and there is a significant number of unknown data to address the above issues an enhancement of the technique is proposed in the ensuing analysis via adapting and extending the iterative procedure proposed by comerford et al 2014 to account for the extrapolation problem at hand in particular the measurement vector z is determined via the optimization problem 14 min z l 1 subject to η a w z or via the counterpart of eq 13 where w is a reweighting matrix see also comerford et al 2014 the rationale of the method relates to the fact that the diagonal matrix w can be used for appropriately weighting the columns of the sampling matrix a for this purpose the elements of the matrix w are selected as the magnitudes of the components of z this choice promotes sparsity as it allows reducing the contribution of the small components of the measurement vector however it has the drawback of requiring a preliminary estimate of z in this regard the l2 norm solution is utilized herein as the associated explicit formula 11 requires a limited computational cost while capturing the key components of the signal adequately next the measurement vector z is determined by solving problem 14 the procedure is beneficial particularly when an ensemble of realizations is available comerford et al 2014 however field measurements involve unique realizations which cannot be repeated in this context the method can be implemented by partitioning the records in small subsets thus considering each subset as an independent realization the procedure is implemented as follows at the first iteration the reweighting matrix is assumed equal to the identity matrix then for each available realization the approximate values of z are calculated by the equation 15 z a w t a w a w t 1 η the magnitude of these values are used for estimating a second matrix w 2 having null values when computed for the first realization as 16 w 2 w 2 d i a g w 1 w 1 w 2 w 2 w n n 2 w n n 2 where 17 w i z 2 i 1 z 2 i once all the realizations have been processed the reweighting matrix is calculated as 18 w w 2 and the procedure is iterated until converging to a certain matrix as a final step the sparse measurement vector z is determined by eq 14 4 numerical application this section provides a numerical example where 3 recorded records of the free surface displacement are used for extrapolating information pertaining to a fourth point located at the centre of their spatial configuration fig 1 the distance between the given points and the extrapolation point is r while the points are uniformly distributed around the extrapolation one in this regard note that the choice of this particular configuration is absolutely arbitrary and is used only for simplifying the discussion and accommodating further analyses on the limits of the technique thus other configurations with for instance more records at various distances from the extrapolation point or points can be adopted the realizations of the free surface displacement in deep water are obtained by numerical simulations relying on the representation 1 according to the method of boccotti et al 2011 each time history is composed by n 120 samples for a total duration of 60 s the generated sea state is compatible with the directional spectrum 19 s ω θ e ω d θ where e ω and d θ are a frequency spectrum and a directional spreading function respectively in this regard the jonswap frequency spectrum hasselmann et al 1973 is utilized in conjunction with a cosine power directional spreading function mitsuyasu et al 1975 specifically 20 e ω α g 2 ω 5 exp 5 4 ω ω p 4 exp ln γ exp ω ω p 2 2 σ 2 ω p 2 and 21 d θ cos 2 s 1 2 θ θ p 0 2 π cos 2 s 1 2 θ 1 the constants in eqs 20 and 21 are γ 3 3 σ 0 07 if ω ω p 0 09 if ω ω p s 20 ω p 1 47 rad s θ p 0 and α 0 01 the significant wave height of the generated sea states is h s 1 m 4 1 sampling matrix construction the full sampling matrix is constructed according to the representation adopted in eq 1 specifically each individual time history of the free surface displacement at a given spatial point is associated with a matrix a x i y i such that 22 a x i y i cos ξ 1 i cos ω 1 t 1 sin ξ 1 i sin ω 1 t 1 cos ξ n n m 2 i cos ω n n m 2 t 1 sin ξ n n m 2 i sin ω n n m 2 t 1 cos ξ 1 i cos ω 1 t n sin ξ 1 i sin ω 1 t n cos ξ n n m 2 i cos ω n n m 2 t n sin ξ n n m 2 i sin ω n n m 2 t n where 23 ξ j i k j y i cos θ j k j x i sin θ j in this regard note that the selection of the angles θ j associated with the frequencies ω j is conducted by the method described by boccotti et al 2011 specifically the directional domain is divided into n small intervals such that 24 θ i θ i 1 d θ d θ 1 n from the directional domain n wave angles are calculated by the equation 25 θ i θ i θ i 1 θ i ε i where ε i are random variables uniformly distributed over the interval 0 1 then each frequency ω j is associated randomly with a certain direction θ i next the full sampling matrix is constructed by assembling individual matrices associated with each record as shown in fig 2 further in the same figure it is shown that the vector on the right hand side is composed by vectors encapsulating the given values of the free surface displacement as 26 η x i y i η x i y i t 1 η x i y i t n the underdetermined system utilized for estimating the sparse measurement vector z is obtained by removing from the full system the rows pertaining to the unknown free surface displacement data 4 2 extrapolation of the free surface displacement an example of extrapolation is shown in fig 3 the figures show on the left panel the given time histories of the free surface displacement such time histories pertain to the same realization obtained via the representation 1 by utilizing the same set of random phase angles for all the records the right panel compares the reconstructed free surface continuous line with the true free surface obtained within the numerical simulation dotted line in this regard note that the reconstruction was pursued without resorting to the adaptive basis approach this specific example has been pursued under the stipulation that the recording points are at a distance r 0 1 l p where l p is the dominant wave length of the sea state it is seen that the reconstruction accuracy of the free surface is quite satisfactory indeed the periods of the individual waves are preserved during the reconstruction while the crests and troughs are slightly either over or under estimated fig 4 shows comparisons regarding frequency spectra and cross correlation functions in this regard note that the cross correlation has been calculated by considering the time histories of points x 1 y 1 and x 1 y 1 while the frequency spectrum of the free surface at the extrapolation point is calculated via the squared amplitudes of its fourier components further note that the results were obtained by averaging the results of 200 realizations the frequency spectrum of the reconstructed signals captures the salient features of the original frequency spectrum dotted line but it also shows unexpected peaks occurring at the high frequency tail this discrepancy was observed also by comerford et al 2014 and apparently relates to the fact that a straightforward application of the l1 norm minimization approach as described in section 3 2 does not yield always the sparsest or even a sparse enough solution this feature doesn t seem to affect the cross correlation that notably retains a quite satisfactory accuracy degree during the reconstruction further to enhance the accuracy the adaptive basis is implemented fig 5 shows that in this case a sparser solution is obtained and thus the unanticipated peaks are eliminated from the record and the frequency spectrum is reasonably well estimated over the entire frequency domain a slight underestimation of the peak frequency value is noticed however the location of the peak is satisfactorily captured furthermore the cross correlation agrees well with the target cross correlation in addition the figure shows a comparison with the results pertaining to the application of a l2 norm minimization in this case it is seen that the results are markedly less representative of the target values indeed the target spectrum is systematically underestimated over the entire frequency domain as are the maxima and minima of the cross correlation a crucial issue in the implementation of cs for extrapolation purposes is the distance between the extrapolation point and the recording point figs 6 and 7 show the results pertaining to the case where the distance r 0 5 l p in a similar manner as in the previous example cs is utilized without fig 6 and with fig 7 the adaptive basis it is seen that the quality of the reconstruction deteriorates if the recording points are far from the extrapolation point however the use of the adaptive basis allows preserving the main features of the cross correlation that otherwise are completely lost as in the previous example the use of a l2 norm minimization provides with a significantly worse extrapolation result as compared to the proposed adaptive basis indeed although the cross correlations are quite similar to each other it is seen that the l2 norm overestimates the frequency spectrum over the whole frequency domain and introduces rather large unrealistic peaks at both low and high frequencies a more general overview on this last issue is given in fig 8 where the correlation coefficient ρ a b given by the equation 27 ρ a b cov a b σ a σ b cov a b being the covariance between a and b and σ a and σ b being the standard deviations of a and b respectively is used for measuring the similarity between the simulated free surface displacements and the reconstructed free surface displacements it is seen that the similarity between the signals rapidly decays with the distance from the recording points the graph is limited to the interval r l p0 0 1 as numerical computations showed that larger values lead to uncorrelated free surface displacement data 4 3 extrapolation of nonlinear free surface data there is a general consensus about the fact that realistic representations of the free surface displacement must account for nonlinear second order in a stokes expansion effects indeed sea waves exhibit sharp crests and flat troughs producing deviations of the crest and trough distributions from the rayleigh distribution which are not captured via the linear water wave theory arena and guedes soares 2009 herein the cs approach is employed via the formulation described in the previous sections by utilizing nonlinear free surface displacement data the rationale of this numerical example is evaluating to what extent this formulation is eligible for applications in real seas where nonlinearity may play a significant role in this context the input data and the target free surface displacement at the point x 1 y 1 are simulated numerically via the method described by romolo et al 2014 which produces a free surface displacement compatible with a random second order stokes wave by superposing a linear wave to a second order contribution for comparison purposes the reconstruction is conducted also by utilizing exclusively the underlying linear free surface displacement finally the correlation coefficient is calculated for both cases in order to check if introducing nonlinearities in the free surface may deteriorate the quality of the reconstruction this numerical example considers three sea states with identical h s 4 m and different peak spectral periods t p 8 5 s 7 s and 6 s these three sea states have steepness coefficient s p 0 035 0 052 and 0 071 respectively forristall 2000 in all cases the simulated time window is 120 s fig 9 shows the correlation coefficients calculated by using the nonlinear waves vis à vis the correlation coefficient calculated by using the linear waves the calculation is pursued by assuming r 0 1 l p totally 100 realizations of the free surface displacement have been synthesized in each case the figure shows that the reconstruction via nonlinear free surface is affected by a small decrease of the correlation coefficient with respect to the linear case with 15 variation of the correlation coefficient with respect to the linear wave reconstruction this evidence is observed also by considering the average value of the correlation coefficient indeed table 1 shows that the greatest discrepancy pertains to the steeper sea state while no substantial difference is observed in case of low steepness 5 concluding remarks compressive sampling cs has revolutionized the signal processing field by allowing sampling signals without the constraint of the nyquist rate to date the ocean engineering community has marginally considered cs as a potent tool for sea waves processing in this paper a cs based technique has been developed for extrapolating free surface displacement time histories the technique relies on the identification of a sampling matrix ensuring determination of a sparse measurement vector incoherence between bases in the sampling and the transform domains and validity of the restricted isometry property the paper has demonstrated that the cs based technique can successfully recover the time history of the free surface displacement given free surface data recorded at various other locations it has been shown that the quality of the reconstruction is highly dependent on the distance between the extrapolation point and the recording point indeed for relatively large distances the quality of the extrapolation deteriorates in this regard it was observed that reliable data are extrapolated at a distance of 0 1 l p l p being the dominant wave length of the sea state while the reconstruction is rather rough for distances of 0 5 l p note that the utilization of an adaptive basis in the technique has drastically improved its accuracy and has addressed the above limitation at a large extent in fact the enhanced technique has reconstructed the target frequency spectrum more accurately while capturing at the same time the main features of the cross correlation between free surface displacement data the herein proposed l1 norm technique has shown to exhibit superior accuracy to a standard l2 norm minimization technique which determined unrealistic peaks in the spectrum at both low and high frequencies in view of the implementation with real field data the technique has been implemented also in conjunction with nonlinear free surface data the numerical results have shown that the reconstruction is slightly less accurate with respect to the case of linear waves this observation appears more evident in quite steep seas where nonlinear effects are important in this regard future studies focusing on situations where nonlinear effects are significant for instance waves in finite water depth or in inhomogeneous wave fields may be pursued in

statistical quantities involved in the description of a random wave field a stationary homogeneous gaussian random wave field is represented by the equation ochi 2005 1 η x y t i 1 n a i cos k i y cos θ i k i x sin θ i ω i t ε i where η x y t is the free surface displacement calculated at a certain location x y at a given time instant t a i are wave amplitudes ω i are frequencies such that ω i ω j if i j θ i are wave directions k i are wave numbers and ε i are random phase angles uniformly distributed over the interval 0 ε i 2π the wave numbers are directly related to the frequencies ω i specifically in deep waters they are calculated as mei et al 2005 2 k i ω i 2 g g being the acceleration due to gravity eq 1 involves the superposition of a large number n of regular waves each having a certain frequency and direction however their amplitudes are related to ω i and θ i via the directional spectrum s ω θ according to the relation 3 s ω θ δ ω δ θ i 1 2 a i 2 for ω ω i ω δ ω and θ θ i θ δ θ in this regard note that the frequency spectrum e ω of the process is associated with the directional spectrum 3 by the equation 4 e ω π π s ω θ d θ the statistical characteristics of the free surface displacement are directly estimated from the directional spectrum ochi 2005 boccotti 2014 specifically the significant wave height h s is given by 5 h s 4 0 π π s ω θ d θ d ω where it is recognized that the quantity under the square root is the variance of the free surface displacement process and the spatial cross correlation is 6 c x y τ e η x y t η x x y y t τ e being the mathematical expectation operator x and y being space lags and τ being a time lag in this context it is seen that c 00 τ is the auto correlation function and c 00 0 is the variance of the free surface displacement process the cross correlation 6 is readily calculated from the directional spectrum via the equation 7 c x y τ 0 π π s ω θ cos k y cos θ k x sin θ ω τ d θ d ω 3 compressive sampling the celebrated shannon s theorem states that the sampling rate of a signal must be at least twice the maximum frequency present in the signal shannon 1949 cs allows recovering signals even in case of undersampling that is even if the sampling rate is smaller than the nyquist rate in this section the fundamental cs assumptions and conditions sparsity incoherence and restricted isometry property are reviewed for completeness next the optimization problem involved in the extrapolation of free surface data is formulated in conjunction with an adaptive iterative procedure for enhancing the accuracy of the extrapolated signal 3 1 sparsity incoherence and restricted isometry property many signals associated with natural phenomena such as sea wave displacements can be represented via a convenient basis with much fewer coefficients than the ones required by the shannon nyquist rate in this regard consider a free surface displacement time history expanded as 8 η t i 1 n a i t z i where a i are the components of an orthonormal basis and z i are the coefficient sequences obtained by projecting η in the a i space the free surface displacement has a sparse representation if several of the z i coefficients have adequately small values and thus can be disregarded for its reconstruction once the coefficients are identified via appropriate optimization algorithms sparsity allows pursuing efficient data compression and statistical estimation comerford et al 2016 the choice of the basis is guided by the property of incoherence specifically cs is pursued by considering that the sampling domain and the sparse transform domain have a high degree of incoherence for instance regarding the fourier basis spikes in the frequency domain correspond to sinusoids in the time domain and vice versa this pair is maximally incoherent as a single coefficient characterizing the signal in the transform domain corresponds to a harmonic signal spanning the entire length of the sampling domain next the robustness of cs is guaranteed by the restricted isometry property rip candes and tao 2005 the sampling matrix a satisfies rip if there exists a constant δ k such that 9 1 δ k z l 2 2 a z l 2 2 1 δ k z l 2 2 for every vector z z 1 z 2 z n with at least k non zero values this property ensures that z cannot be in the null space of a or equivalently that any matrix composed of k randomly selected columns of a should have full rank and be nearly orthonormal to demonstrate that rip holds for a given matrix a is np hard candes et al 2006b however for some matrices such as gaussian random matrices fornasier and rauhut 2011 rip holds with a high probability 3 2 signal reconstruction by l1 norm minimization consider n free surface displacement time histories each composed by n samples available at certain locations x i y i next the objective is to extrapolate and determine time histories at arbitrary m distinct points x j y j for this purpose define η the nn 1 column vector containing the known samples of the free surface displacement and a the nn n n m sampling matrix then the measurement vector z considered sparse is determined by solving the problem 10 η a z eq 10 constitutes an underdetermined problem with infinite solutions therefore an additional constraint is imposed with the objective of determining a unique solution that is as sparse as possible it is known that the sparsest solution occurs when the l0 norm of z is minimized however this optimization problem is non convex with no known exact solution candes et al 2006a instead a known solution is available by minimizing the l2 norm of z in this context it can be readily shown that 11 min z l 2 a t a a t 1 η this solution minimizes z in a mean square sense but in general does not lead to a sparse solution a convenient alternative to these constraints is given by the minimization of the l1 norm indeed l1 norm still promotes sparsity and in addition gives rise to a convex optimization problem that can be solved for instance by a gradient based optimization method stanković et al 2012 in this context the optimization problem is recast in the linear programming form 12 min z l 1 subject to η az considering the fact that z is usually only approximately sparse and that some noise is always included in the computed values eq 12 takes the form 13 min z l 1 subject to a z η l 2 e where e denotes a tolerance value this modification has the effect of applying intervals to the solution further promoting sparsity 3 3 accuracy enhancement via an adaptive iterative procedure as demonstrated in comerford et al 2014 eq 12 or eq 13 is rather straightforward to apply however this kind of treatment comes with certain limitations one potential drawback relates to the significant computational effort required in case of large amounts of recorded data the second issue relates to the fact that the reconstructed free surface spectrum may occasionally contain spurious large peaks at unanticipated frequency values this situation occurs specifically when the number of available records is small and there is a significant number of unknown data to address the above issues an enhancement of the technique is proposed in the ensuing analysis via adapting and extending the iterative procedure proposed by comerford et al 2014 to account for the extrapolation problem at hand in particular the measurement vector z is determined via the optimization problem 14 min z l 1 subject to η a w z or via the counterpart of eq 13 where w is a reweighting matrix see also comerford et al 2014 the rationale of the method relates to the fact that the diagonal matrix w can be used for appropriately weighting the columns of the sampling matrix a for this purpose the elements of the matrix w are selected as the magnitudes of the components of z this choice promotes sparsity as it allows reducing the contribution of the small components of the measurement vector however it has the drawback of requiring a preliminary estimate of z in this regard the l2 norm solution is utilized herein as the associated explicit formula 11 requires a limited computational cost while capturing the key components of the signal adequately next the measurement vector z is determined by solving problem 14 the procedure is beneficial particularly when an ensemble of realizations is available comerford et al 2014 however field measurements involve unique realizations which cannot be repeated in this context the method can be implemented by partitioning the records in small subsets thus considering each subset as an independent realization the procedure is implemented as follows at the first iteration the reweighting matrix is assumed equal to the identity matrix then for each available realization the approximate values of z are calculated by the equation 15 z a w t a w a w t 1 η the magnitude of these values are used for estimating a second matrix w 2 having null values when computed for the first realization as 16 w 2 w 2 d i a g w 1 w 1 w 2 w 2 w n n 2 w n n 2 where 17 w i z 2 i 1 z 2 i once all the realizations have been processed the reweighting matrix is calculated as 18 w w 2 and the procedure is iterated until converging to a certain matrix as a final step the sparse measurement vector z is determined by eq 14 4 numerical application this section provides a numerical example where 3 recorded records of the free surface displacement are used for extrapolating information pertaining to a fourth point located at the centre of their spatial configuration fig 1 the distance between the given points and the extrapolation point is r while the points are uniformly distributed around the extrapolation one in this regard note that the choice of this particular configuration is absolutely arbitrary and is used only for simplifying the discussion and accommodating further analyses on the limits of the technique thus other configurations with for instance more records at various distances from the extrapolation point or points can be adopted the realizations of the free surface displacement in deep water are obtained by numerical simulations relying on the representation 1 according to the method of boccotti et al 2011 each time history is composed by n 120 samples for a total duration of 60 s the generated sea state is compatible with the directional spectrum 19 s ω θ e ω d θ where e ω and d θ are a frequency spectrum and a directional spreading function respectively in this regard the jonswap frequency spectrum hasselmann et al 1973 is utilized in conjunction with a cosine power directional spreading function mitsuyasu et al 1975 specifically 20 e ω α g 2 ω 5 exp 5 4 ω ω p 4 exp ln γ exp ω ω p 2 2 σ 2 ω p 2 and 21 d θ cos 2 s 1 2 θ θ p 0 2 π cos 2 s 1 2 θ 1 the constants in eqs 20 and 21 are γ 3 3 σ 0 07 if ω ω p 0 09 if ω ω p s 20 ω p 1 47 rad s θ p 0 and α 0 01 the significant wave height of the generated sea states is h s 1 m 4 1 sampling matrix construction the full sampling matrix is constructed according to the representation adopted in eq 1 specifically each individual time history of the free surface displacement at a given spatial point is associated with a matrix a x i y i such that 22 a x i y i cos ξ 1 i cos ω 1 t 1 sin ξ 1 i sin ω 1 t 1 cos ξ n n m 2 i cos ω n n m 2 t 1 sin ξ n n m 2 i sin ω n n m 2 t 1 cos ξ 1 i cos ω 1 t n sin ξ 1 i sin ω 1 t n cos ξ n n m 2 i cos ω n n m 2 t n sin ξ n n m 2 i sin ω n n m 2 t n where 23 ξ j i k j y i cos θ j k j x i sin θ j in this regard note that the selection of the angles θ j associated with the frequencies ω j is conducted by the method described by boccotti et al 2011 specifically the directional domain is divided into n small intervals such that 24 θ i θ i 1 d θ d θ 1 n from the directional domain n wave angles are calculated by the equation 25 θ i θ i θ i 1 θ i ε i where ε i are random variables uniformly distributed over the interval 0 1 then each frequency ω j is associated randomly with a certain direction θ i next the full sampling matrix is constructed by assembling individual matrices associated with each record as shown in fig 2 further in the same figure it is shown that the vector on the right hand side is composed by vectors encapsulating the given values of the free surface displacement as 26 η x i y i η x i y i t 1 η x i y i t n the underdetermined system utilized for estimating the sparse measurement vector z is obtained by removing from the full system the rows pertaining to the unknown free surface displacement data 4 2 extrapolation of the free surface displacement an example of extrapolation is shown in fig 3 the figures show on the left panel the given time histories of the free surface displacement such time histories pertain to the same realization obtained via the representation 1 by utilizing the same set of random phase angles for all the records the right panel compares the reconstructed free surface continuous line with the true free surface obtained within the numerical simulation dotted line in this regard note that the reconstruction was pursued without resorting to the adaptive basis approach this specific example has been pursued under the stipulation that the recording points are at a distance r 0 1 l p where l p is the dominant wave length of the sea state it is seen that the reconstruction accuracy of the free surface is quite satisfactory indeed the periods of the individual waves are preserved during the reconstruction while the crests and troughs are slightly either over or under estimated fig 4 shows comparisons regarding frequency spectra and cross correlation functions in this regard note that the cross correlation has been calculated by considering the time histories of points x 1 y 1 and x 1 y 1 while the frequency spectrum of the free surface at the extrapolation point is calculated via the squared amplitudes of its fourier components further note that the results were obtained by averaging the results of 200 realizations the frequency spectrum of the reconstructed signals captures the salient features of the original frequency spectrum dotted line but it also shows unexpected peaks occurring at the high frequency tail this discrepancy was observed also by comerford et al 2014 and apparently relates to the fact that a straightforward application of the l1 norm minimization approach as described in section 3 2 does not yield always the sparsest or even a sparse enough solution this feature doesn t seem to affect the cross correlation that notably retains a quite satisfactory accuracy degree during the reconstruction further to enhance the accuracy the adaptive basis is implemented fig 5 shows that in this case a sparser solution is obtained and thus the unanticipated peaks are eliminated from the record and the frequency spectrum is reasonably well estimated over the entire frequency domain a slight underestimation of the peak frequency value is noticed however the location of the peak is satisfactorily captured furthermore the cross correlation agrees well with the target cross correlation in addition the figure shows a comparison with the results pertaining to the application of a l2 norm minimization in this case it is seen that the results are markedly less representative of the target values indeed the target spectrum is systematically underestimated over the entire frequency domain as are the maxima and minima of the cross correlation a crucial issue in the implementation of cs for extrapolation purposes is the distance between the extrapolation point and the recording point figs 6 and 7 show the results pertaining to the case where the distance r 0 5 l p in a similar manner as in the previous example cs is utilized without fig 6 and with fig 7 the adaptive basis it is seen that the quality of the reconstruction deteriorates if the recording points are far from the extrapolation point however the use of the adaptive basis allows preserving the main features of the cross correlation that otherwise are completely lost as in the previous example the use of a l2 norm minimization provides with a significantly worse extrapolation result as compared to the proposed adaptive basis indeed although the cross correlations are quite similar to each other it is seen that the l2 norm overestimates the frequency spectrum over the whole frequency domain and introduces rather large unrealistic peaks at both low and high frequencies a more general overview on this last issue is given in fig 8 where the correlation coefficient ρ a b given by the equation 27 ρ a b cov a b σ a σ b cov a b being the covariance between a and b and σ a and σ b being the standard deviations of a and b respectively is used for measuring the similarity between the simulated free surface displacements and the reconstructed free surface displacements it is seen that the similarity between the signals rapidly decays with the distance from the recording points the graph is limited to the interval r l p0 0 1 as numerical computations showed that larger values lead to uncorrelated free surface displacement data 4 3 extrapolation of nonlinear free surface data there is a general consensus about the fact that realistic representations of the free surface displacement must account for nonlinear second order in a stokes expansion effects indeed sea waves exhibit sharp crests and flat troughs producing deviations of the crest and trough distributions from the rayleigh distribution which are not captured via the linear water wave theory arena and guedes soares 2009 herein the cs approach is employed via the formulation described in the previous sections by utilizing nonlinear free surface displacement data the rationale of this numerical example is evaluating to what extent this formulation is eligible for applications in real seas where nonlinearity may play a significant role in this context the input data and the target free surface displacement at the point x 1 y 1 are simulated numerically via the method described by romolo et al 2014 which produces a free surface displacement compatible with a random second order stokes wave by superposing a linear wave to a second order contribution for comparison purposes the reconstruction is conducted also by utilizing exclusively the underlying linear free surface displacement finally the correlation coefficient is calculated for both cases in order to check if introducing nonlinearities in the free surface may deteriorate the quality of the reconstruction this numerical example considers three sea states with identical h s 4 m and different peak spectral periods t p 8 5 s 7 s and 6 s these three sea states have steepness coefficient s p 0 035 0 052 and 0 071 respectively forristall 2000 in all cases the simulated time window is 120 s fig 9 shows the correlation coefficients calculated by using the nonlinear waves vis à vis the correlation coefficient calculated by using the linear waves the calculation is pursued by assuming r 0 1 l p totally 100 realizations of the free surface displacement have been synthesized in each case the figure shows that the reconstruction via nonlinear free surface is affected by a small decrease of the correlation coefficient with respect to the linear case with 15 variation of the correlation coefficient with respect to the linear wave reconstruction this evidence is observed also by considering the average value of the correlation coefficient indeed table 1 shows that the greatest discrepancy pertains to the steeper sea state while no substantial difference is observed in case of low steepness 5 concluding remarks compressive sampling cs has revolutionized the signal processing field by allowing sampling signals without the constraint of the nyquist rate to date the ocean engineering community has marginally considered cs as a potent tool for sea waves processing in this paper a cs based technique has been developed for extrapolating free surface displacement time histories the technique relies on the identification of a sampling matrix ensuring determination of a sparse measurement vector incoherence between bases in the sampling and the transform domains and validity of the restricted isometry property the paper has demonstrated that the cs based technique can successfully recover the time history of the free surface displacement given free surface data recorded at various other locations it has been shown that the quality of the reconstruction is highly dependent on the distance between the extrapolation point and the recording point indeed for relatively large distances the quality of the extrapolation deteriorates in this regard it was observed that reliable data are extrapolated at a distance of 0 1 l p l p being the dominant wave length of the sea state while the reconstruction is rather rough for distances of 0 5 l p note that the utilization of an adaptive basis in the technique has drastically improved its accuracy and has addressed the above limitation at a large extent in fact the enhanced technique has reconstructed the target frequency spectrum more accurately while capturing at the same time the main features of the cross correlation between free surface displacement data the herein proposed l1 norm technique has shown to exhibit superior accuracy to a standard l2 norm minimization technique which determined unrealistic peaks in the spectrum at both low and high frequencies in view of the implementation with real field data the technique has been implemented also in conjunction with nonlinear free surface data the numerical results have shown that the reconstruction is slightly less accurate with respect to the case of linear waves this observation appears more evident in quite steep seas where nonlinear effects are important in this regard future studies focusing on situations where nonlinear effects are significant for instance waves in finite water depth or in inhomogeneous wave fields may be pursued in
