385,the remediation of aquifers contaminated by viscous dense non aqueous phase liquids dnapls is a challenging problem coal tars are the most abundant persistent dnapls due to their high viscosity and complexity pumping processes leave considerable volume fractions of dnapls in the soil and demand high operational costs to reach cleaning objectives thermally enhanced recovery focuses on decreasing dnapl viscosity to reduce residual saturation the oil industry has previously applied this technique with great success for enhanced oil recovery applications however in soil remediation high porous media permeabilities and product densities may invalidate those techniques additionally the impacts of temperature on coal tar s physical properties have not been thoroughly discussed in available literature here we investigated how coal tar s physical properties the capillary pressure saturation curve and the relative permeability of two phase flow in porous media depend on the temperature and flow rate experimentally drainage and imbibition experiments under quasi static steady state and dynamic unsteady state conditions have been carried out at 293 15 k and 323 15 k in a 1d small cell filled with 1 mm homogeneous glass beads two different pairs of immiscible fluids have been investigated coal tar water and canola oil ethanol results demonstrated similar trends for temperature effect and values of fluid properties for both liquid pairs which backs up the use of canola oil ethanol to model coal tar water flow it was found that there is no temperature effect on drainage imbibition curves or residual saturation under quasi static conditions in dynamic conditions the dnapl residual saturation decreased by 16 when the temperature changed from 293 15 k to 323 15 k this drop was mainly linked to decreasing viscous fingering as well as the appearance of wetting phase films around the glass beads both phenomena have been observed only in dynamic experiments a high enough pumping flow rate is needed to generate dynamic effects in the porous medium ethanol and oil s relative permeabilities also increase with temperature under dynamic measurement conditions our findings indicate that flow rate is an important parameter to consider in thermal enhanced recovery processes these effects are not taken into account in the classically used generalized darcy s

their high density dnapls can deeply sink into the subsurface until reaching a less permeable layer and form a non aqueous reservoir subsurface zones contaminated by dnapls are generally hard to delimit due to soil heterogeneity soil dispersion and the substantial depth of the contamination combined with gravity driven finger flow thus remediating these pollutants in the aquifer is a complicated matter dnapl source zones are even more problematic because they may keep on dissolving toxic compounds into the groundwater ultimately future health and environmental problems can arise such as drinking water contamination or soil quality degradation commonly reported dnapl contaminants include chlorinated solvents namely trichloroethylene tce and tetrachloroethylene pce that were previously widely used as solvents for organic materials schwille and pankow 1988 coal tars are also a notable dnapl found in the subsurface and are also more viscous than water brown et al 2006 have measured coal tar s dynamic viscosity on multiple sites and have found that the coal tar water viscosity ratio can vary between 10 and 106 brown et al 2006 this range is linked to the chemical heterogeneity in coal tar diagnosis and risk assessment are hard because the exact composition of coal tar is generally not identifiable hence a site polluted by coal tar is difficult to clean up and the choice for an applicable recovery method has to be made on a case by case basis in our study the focus is on coal tar source zones with high pollutant concentrations pumping in the subsurface through production wells is a primary step used in remediation operations however the pumping rate is very low for dnapls and the remediation could take tens to hundreds of years which is economically unsatisfying usepa 1996 russell and rabideau 2000 kavanaugh and kresic 2008 navy 2008 newell et al 2011 the most efficient current methods for remediating dnapl source zones are thermal treatments ding et al 2019 generally temperature is increased to vaporize mcdade et al 2005 baker et al 2006 baston et al 2010 or even burn rein 2009 switzer et al 2009 hasan et al 2015 scholes et al 2015 the pollutant the vapors generated are then collected and treated with carbon activated filters however generating high temperature fields can be dangerous for the nutritional and biological functions of the soil pape et al 2015 have shown that even if a contaminant can be completely treated at 773 15 k the soil is unusable for future construction or industrial operations o carroll et al 2005 pape et al 2015 as a result napl residual saturation is lower in the soil after a thermally enhanced process afterwards the high soil temperature can increase the degradation rate of chemical treatments oxidation surfactant flooding and biological methods bio or phytoremediation melin et al 1998 hot water flooding is another technique that has shown success in treating viscous napls light or dense contamination the idea is to reduce the dynamic viscosity of the napl by increasing its temperature during pumping the hot water will progressively replace the napl and leave residual napl saturation in the soil previous authors have shown that injecting hot water increases total napl recovery volumes by pumping processes fulton and reuter 1991 davis 1997 o carroll and sleep 2007 pumping a dnapl phase from the subsurface can be represented by an imbibition process in porous media the dnapl phase is progressively pushed away from the soil and the water slowly fills the pores left vacant thus it is important to analyze and better understand fluid displacements before drawing any conclusions to characterize the behavior of the physical system composed of dnapl water and a solid matrix is still an ongoing challenge in fluid mechanics currently modelling is based on the theory of immiscible multiphase flow in porous media in our case dnapl and water are represented as two separate phases and the soil is an immobile solid matrix in which both liquids may flow for this type of engineering application the simultaneous flow of dnapl and water in a porous medium is commonly described using the generalization of darcy s law to multiphase flow for each phase muskat and meres 1936 1 u i k k r i s i μ i p i ρ i g where u i is the darcy velocity m s 1 g the gravitational acceleration k the permeability tensor m2 pi the pressure pa μ i and ρ i respectively the dynamic viscosity pa s and density kg m 3 the subscript i designates the water or dnapl phase the main difference between darcy s law and its extension to multiphase flow is the addition of relative permeability terms k r i it signifies that each phase flows independently through a virtual porous medium of permeability kk r i si the dnapl occupies a part of the total pore space depending on its saturation which reduces the volume of water that can flow through and vice versa this equation generally holds true when there is no momentum transfer at the interface of both fluid phases whitaker 1986 the presence of the two fluid phases results in an interface that is subjected to interfacial tension at the pore scale this interface also causes a pressure discontinuity at the macroscale with respect to capillary pressure pc this is subsequently defined as the difference between the pressure of the non wetting fluid pnw and the pressure of the wetting fluid pw 2 p n w p w p c s w immiscible dnapls flowing in the aquifer can be assimilated to a two phase flow in porous media the dimensionless numbers controlling the actual flow pattern are respectively bond number bo capillary number ca and viscosity ratio m in the case of the imbibition of a wetting phase inside a porous medium saturated with a non wetting phase these numbers can be written as 3 b o ρ n w ρ w g l 2 γ 4 c a v c μ i n v γ 5 m μ i n v μ d i s l is a characteristic length in unconsolidated media like glass beads l is often chosen equal to the mean particle diameter γ is the interfacial tension between both liquid phases vc is a characteristic velocity representing the order of magnitude of the flow rate inside the pores the subscripts inv and dis respectively represent the invading and displaced phase in this work the dnapl and water are the invading phases during drainage and imbibition respectively alternatively the viscosity ratio may be replaced by the mobility ratio the ratio between relative permeability and viscosity the latter includes relative permeabilities in its calculation and can be more suitable for real porous media hagoort 1974 it is possible to identify flow regimes depending on the order of magnitude of each number the different types of two phase flow that occur in micro models are classified as capillary fingering viscous fingering and stable displacement lenormand et al 1988 according to the authors the type of flow that promotes maximum coal tar recovery and minimizes residual dnapl saturation is stable displacement which occurs only for m 1 and ca 10 4 in practice coal tar is much more viscous than water and m 1 in the case of pumping coal tar the main objective of thermally enhanced oil recovery is therefore to reduce this viscosity ratio in order to decrease the mobility ratio and to promote stable displacement in the porous medium the effect of temperature on bond and capillary number should also be estimated in order to link those to the benefits of thermal enhancement mclaren et al 2009 found that for a soil consisting of london clays an increase from 12 c to 30 c not only reduces the kinematic viscosity of a coal tar from 10 4 m2 s 1 to 10 5 m2 s 1 but also significantly reduces the residual saturation despite a small variation in the capillary effect mclaren et al 2009 davis 1994 experimentally obtained a decrease in residual dnapl saturation by heating from 10 c to 30 c without any temperature effect on interfacial tension davis 1994 sleep and ma 1997 found only a 10 change in the interfacial tension of the pce water pair when heated from 20 c to 90 c sleep and ma 1997 bachmann et al 2002 suggest that the decrease in residual saturation is also related to a decrease in the contact angle it can decrease by 0 03 c for sand and up to 0 26 c for silts bachmann et al 2002 more recently colombano et al 2020 studied the thermally enhanced recovery of heavy chlorinated solvents in a highly permeable porous medium and observed no effect of temperature on residual saturation on quasi static drainage and imbibition conditions colombano et al 2020 a few similar studies have been proposed in the past for viscous oil recovery koci et al 1989 studied the effect of temperature on oil water in unconsolidated porous media sand between 298 15 k and 443 15 k the main findings were that raising temperature increased the irreducible water saturation but also decreased the residual oil saturation and the relative oil permeability koci et al 1989 wang et al 2006 investigated the effect of oil viscosity on relative permeability curves for oil water in sand packs the measurements were made at constant flow rate the decrease in oil viscosity was linked to an increase in both oil and water relative permeability curves wang et al 2006 the impact of temperature on oil water relative permeability interfacial tension and wettability has been reviewed by esmaeili et al 2019 observations on the effect of temperature on two phase flow in porous media were mainly linked to variations in those parameters therefore it is very difficult to extend the findings from literature reviews on different liquids to a complex liquid such as coal tar also some authors pointed out that a lot of relative permeability available data is not exact due to the presence of experimental artifacts e g viscous fingering capillary end effects wettability and pore distribution changes due to temperature variations specifically reliable relative permeability measurements require a flow regime dominated by capillary forces at the pore scale eq 1 is only valid for low capillary numbers davit and quintard 2019 oil reservoirs generally have low permeability less than 10 11 m2 the velocity is generally low enough to validate the hypothesis behind the use of generalized darcy s law however in the case of soil remediation the napl phase is present due to a spill and is often found in highly permeable zones in the subsurface above 10 11 m2 for instance in our application case coal tar was pumped in alluvial sands with a permeability of 10 9 m2 the use of generalized darcy s law and eq 2 implies a quasi static assumption the interface between both fluid phases is described by a succession of quasi static thermodynamic states without any dependence on time capillary effects are predominant at the pore scale and are represented at macroscale using eq 2 relative permeabilities represent viscous effects to generalize darcy s law to multiphase flow however this assumption is not always satisfied when considering multiphase flows in a transient process for instance when considering pumping napl in the subsurface the capillary number will be obviously very high near the production well the main objective of this work is to measure changes in the physical properties of coal tar caused by temperature variations and to relate those to two phase flow properties in highly permeable porous media we explored how temperature influences the capillary pressure saturation and relative permeability curves under quasi static two phase flow conditions our goal was to better understand and characterize the two phase flow in highly permeable porous media with a focus on temperature first we determined the properties of coal tar sampled from a real polluted site section 2 data on its density dynamic viscosity interfacial tension with water and contact angle with water on a glass slide were measured between 293 15 k and 323 15 k then we describe an experimental setup that has been used to study two phase flow in porous media in isothermal conditions section 3 we conducted experiments at two temperatures 293 15 k and 323 15 k under quasi static conditions then we carried out drainage and imbibition tests at different flow rates and temperatures to study the effect of temperature on two phase flow under dynamic conditions finally we summarize the results including the capillary pressure saturation relationship analysis of used dimensionless numbers and a discussion on saturation and pressure time profiles as well as relative permeability curves obtained under dynamic conditions section 4 2 fluid characterization as a function of temperature 2 1 fluid selection and properties the main couple of liquids for this study is coal tar and water coal tars are pyrolysis by products polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons pahs are the main chemical compounds found in coal tars previous studies on coal tars indicate that their physical properties depend on their chemical origin and the geology of the source zones kong 2004 in addition the complete chemical composition of coal tars is hard to determine by analytical means johansson et al 2019 we used a coal tar sample produced from a well situated in a former coke plant suspended solid particles were removed from the sample using a glass fiber membrane gf d 2 7 µm pore size some water was also collected during coal tar sampling the water contained inside the sample was filtered out with a vacuum pump and a 10 μm pore size hydrophobic ptfe membrane the resulting sample containing only coal tar was kept in a cold room at 277 15 k to limit chemical reaction rates evaporation and variations in physical properties during the study degassed tap water was used in all coal tar and water flow in porous media experiments ultrapure water was also considered for the experiments but was not suitable because coal tar dissolves partially in it dnapls like coal tar are generally difficult to experiment with due to their high toxicity and their adhesion on laboratory glassware as previously mentioned coal tar has generally an unknown and very heterogeneous composition it has also been observed that the composition of coal tar can change in the experimental setups therefore we chose a model fluid pair made of two immiscible pure compounds canola oil and ethanol virgin canola oil was used as the substitute for coal tar non wetting fluid the choice of virgin oil was motivated by the fact that refined canola oil was found to change color when heated vegetable oils have however a lower density than water thus we chose to work with ethanol as the wetting fluid sodium chloride was dissolved into the ethanol at room temperature 293 15 k at a concentration of 0 65 g kg the addition of salt was required to measure soil resistivity in a parallel study iravani et al 2020 from this point water and salty ethanol will be referred to as the wetting phase coal tar and canola oil will be referred to as the non wetting phase 2 2 density we measured all the densities coal tar water salty ethanol canola oil using a pycnometer 25 ml 0 04 ml and an analytical balance 0 01 g the pycnometer was first calibrated with ultrapure water at room temperature 293 15 k density values were then measured at the same temperature the effect of temperature on density was determined by placing the liquid inside an insulated closet initially at 293 15 k the temperature of the closet was increased by steps of 10 k and the density was then measured with the same pycnometer the procedure was repeated until reaching 323 15 k in triplicate per liquid finally measurements were also acquired at 277 15 k by placing the sample in a cold room fig 1 presents the density measurements as a function of temperature for ethanol canola oil water and coal tar coal tar has a higher density than water at all temperatures tested in this study therefore coal tar behaves as a dnapl in the polluted aquifer zone the coal tar density values measured in this study were close to previously reported measurements at 295 15 k 308 15 k and 323 15 k kong 2004 linear regression was applied using the least squares method we observed that ethanol canola oil water and coal tar densities decrease almost linearly when their temperature increases from 277 15 k to 323 15 k the measurements indicate that the volumetric thermal expansion coefficient can be considered constant for these fluids for each fluid the estimated correlations are the following with temperature in kelvin 6 ρ c t t 1237 0 4818 t 7 ρ w t 1073 0 2598 t 8 ρ e t 990 3 0 6224 t 9 ρ o t 1059 0 5033 t 2 3 dynamic viscosity we measured all the dynamic viscosities coal tar water salty ethanol canola oil using a rotational rheometer thermo scientific haake mars iii and cone plate geometry the plate was connected to thermoelectric cooling peltier effect in order to reach temperatures between 283 15 k and 323 15 k the rheometer applied a constant shear rate and measured the responding shear stress of the liquid correct calibration of the gap between the cone and the plate is of great importance for precise measurements in our study this gap can change due to thermal expansion thus we first heated the plate to the desired temperature then calibrated the gap prior to measurements finally the liquid sample 2 ml was injected onto the plate the range of the shear rate measurements was comprised between 10 s 1 and 100 s 1 for newtonian fluids the shear stress is proportional to the shear rate in this case the dynamic viscosity μ is defined as a constant proportionality factor between both parameters first coal tar shear stress was determined at 293 15 k for shear rates varying from 10 s 1 to 100 s 1 the shear stress increased proportionally as the shear rate increases thus the coal tar sampled in this study displays the behavior of a newtonian fluid between 283 15 k and 323 15 k previous studies have found that liquid coal tar is shear thinning bhatia et al 1977 fitzer et al 1987 the difference in behavior found here may be due to either the historical origin of the coal tar sample or the focus on a lower temperature 283 15 k compared to these studies 373 15 k fig 2 presents the effect of temperature on the dynamic viscosities of ethanol canola oil water and coal tar dynamic viscosities decreased while temperature increased in all fluids the andrade equation two parameters empirical exponential model was used to fit viscosity data andrade 1940 the relative changes of dynamic viscosity due to temperature were found to be close for non wetting liquids canola oil and coal tar and also wetting liquids ethanol and water 10 μ c t t 1 71 10 8 e 4 37 10 3 t 11 μ w t 9 82 10 7 e 2 03 10 3 t 12 μ e t 1 22 10 6 e 2 16 10 3 t 13 μ o t 1 60 10 7 e 3 96 10 3 t 2 4 interfacial tension and contact angle interfacial tension and contact angles measurements were made with a drop shape analyzer krüss dsa 100 the apparatus consists of a light source a camera and the sample provided by a syringe a drop of the non wetting fluid coal tar or canola oil is injected into a bath filled with the wetting fluid water or salty ethanol the bath and the syringe are surrounded by an insulated chamber the chamber is connected to a thermostat which can change the measuring temperature between 285 15 k and 323 15 k the accuracy for interfacial tension contact angle and temperature measurements are respectively 0 3 mn m 0 3 and 0 1 k a camera controlled by krüss advance software is able to detect the drop and shape contours from images for interfacial tension and contact angle measurements the calibration of the apparatus was checked by measuring pure water s surface tension between 285 15 k and 323 15 k for interfacial tension measurements a 1 mm diameter ptfe needle was used a non wetting drop was formed at the tip of the needle directly inside the wetting fluid the choices of needle diameter and drop volume were motivated by a previous work berry et al 2015 the measurements were done in triplicate for each target temperature the measurements were then acquired every minute and averaged over one hour the interfacial tension was determined with young laplace equation the method used by krüss advance software automatically detects the drop in the image and fit shape factor in order to reproduce its contour the interfacial tension is then calculated from 14 γ δ ρ g r 0 2 β where δρ is the difference between densities of the two phases g the standard acceleration due to gravity r0 the drop radius at its apex β a shape factor for contact angle measurements a glass slide was introduced inside the wetting fluid water and ethanol bath a non wetting fluid dnapl and canola oil drop was then injected on the glass slide the drop shape was reproduced by krüss software using the previously introduced young laplace equation the contact angle was measured as the angle between the detected contour and baseline represented by the horizontal glass slide pure water air surface tension measurements were in agreement with previous ones made by vargaftik et al 1983 this validates the proposed experimental apparatus and our protocol prior to temperature measurements interfacial tension was measured against time for a coal tar tap water system over 200 minutes at 293 15 k and 323 15 k the interfacial tension decreased in both cases as coal tar ages in tap water this change in interfacial tension results from a small amount of coal tar dissolving rate into the water at the interface the measurements could not be taken for a longer time as the drop fell off afterwards to discuss only the temperature effect all the interfacial tension measurements that follow were taken after 2 minutes the interfacial tension measurements for salty ethanol canola oil and coal tar water are plotted in fig 3 the reported range of interfacial tensions is generally comprised between 20 50 mn m for tce pce and chlorinated solvents with water at 293 15 k cai and mohanty 1997 dawson and roberts 1997 smith and zhang 2001 yet for both fluid pairs studied we observed low interfacial tensions 3 mn m such low values are found for liquids containing amphiphilic substances this may be the case for the coal tar used in this study as it was a mixture sampled from a real polluted site and its exact chemical composition is unknown commercial oils can also contain additives that reduce the interfacial tension of water oil gaonkar 1989 sanaiotti et al 2010 measured a range of interfacial tensions between soybean oil and water and ethanol mixtures sanaiotti et al 2010 the reported values were between 1 3 mn m which are close to what we measured unknown additives inside the oil might be the cause of these differences previous studies have found that the influence of temperature on interfacial tension is linked to its influence on mutual solubility for binary mixtures composed of a polar and a non polar liquid solubility increases linearly with temperature as a consequence interfacial tension also decreases linearly donahue and bartell 1952 the same trend was found here for coal tar and water as well as for canola oil ethanol in our measurements however the decreasing interfacial tension with temperature for canola oil ethanol was more significant than the decrease for the coal tar water system the linear relationships between interfacial tension and temperatures for both fluid pairs are described by 15 γ c t w t 3 3 3 3 10 3 t 16 γ o e t 5 7 1 2 10 2 t the accuracy of the apparatus was 0 3 mn m which is around 10 of our absolute measurement value fig 4 presents contact angles for coal tar and canola oil droplets against temperature the variations of contact angle are not significant between 283 15 k and 333 15 k and can be considered constant with temperature the slight variations observed on coal tar sessile drops could also be due to repeatability issues with the sessile drop method all materials were cleaned thoroughly between any two measurements and the measurement conditions temperature injection speed and droplet size were precisely respected the measured contact angles between both couples of liquids seem close however coal tar also sticks on solid surfaces while canola oil does not our measurements of contact angle on a glass slide are a first indication of wetting phase conditions they do not reflect the more complex behavior happening with complex liquids like coal tar inside a real porous medium 3 experimental setups and procedures for capillary behavior characterizations the parameters measured in section 2 indicate that temperature has an effect only on the dynamic viscosities of the fluids here we performed the drainage and imbibition experiments for coal tar water and canola oil ethanol in two experimental configurations fig 5 first small pressure variations were applied using a small 1d column to limit viscous fingering and measure capillary pressure saturation curves at 293 15 k and 323 15 k this also avoided interface instability thus we focused on how parameters change with temperature in a generalized darcy s law application case the drainage and imbibition experiments were done using a small transparent 2d cell using the same configuration as before finally the 2d cell was connected to a volumetric pump where flow rate and temperature were varied to observe their effects on saturation and pressure profiles 3 1 experimental setups experiments were carried out inside a 1d vertical column diameter 5 2 cm height 5 6 cm the column fig 5a was made of polyvinylidene fluoride pvdf to resist coal tar corrosion the measurements were made for both fluid pairs coal tar water and canola oil ethanol coal tar was sampled from a field mainly composed of coarse sand with d50 1 mm thus 1 mm homogeneous glass beads were chosen for the experiments this was to avoid inaccuracies due to adsorption effects particle shape heterogeneity pore size distribution and possible wettability changes during data acquisition as shown in fig 5b the drainage imbibition experiments for coal tar water and canola oil ethanol were also performed in a small 2d cell length 5 0 cm height 5 0 cm width 2 0 cm this 2d cell was also made of pvdf to ensure high corrosion resistance against coal tar the cell was made of two transparent glass plates in order to visualize the two phase flow using imaging the container with both fluids was placed on a sartorius cubis mse 0 1 g mass scale acquiring data automatically every 6 s two pressure transducers keller pr33x 300 pa were added to the setup as three way junctions at the top and bottom of the cell the tubing connected to transducers was filled with ethanol initially to avoid the presence of air in the system both transducers were initially calibrated to read 0 10 pa at atmospheric pressure at their respective positions the homogeneity of our beads was checked with sieves with mesh sizes between 0 96 mm and 1 04 mm the mass of glass beads inside the medium was kept constant in order to ensure similar compaction porosity and initial saturation between various experiments the column was filled with glass beads and vibrated slowly during the packing process glass beads were held inside the setup using the stainless steel grids mesh size 0 9 mm initially the wetting phase was injected at 25 ml min with a peristaltic pump inside the porous medium the possible presence of residual air was checked by measuring porosity and permeability experiments were conducted on columns with a porosity between 0 39 and 0 42 the mean permeability of the glass beads was measured to be 3 5 10 10 m2 3 2 quasi static experiment procedure in the quasi static experiment setup the column was connected to two scaled reservoirs 3 5 cm internal diameter and 41 8 cm high details on the experimental setup in quasi static conditions are available in colombano et al 2020 one reservoir was connected to the bottom of the column and filled with the non wetting phase the other reservoir was connected to the top and filled with the wetting phase in this setup the measurements were made by successive equilibrium states the capillary pressure pc is defined as the difference between the pressure of the non wetting phase and that of the wetting phase thus the capillary pressure can be directly defined as the difference of hydrostatic pressures hc between the non wetting and wetting liquids 17 p c p n w p w ρ n w ρ w g h c we chose the initial conditions for the experiments so that the interface between the non wetting and wetting phase would be at equilibrium at the bottom of the 1d column this means that z 0 corresponds to a level of non wetting fluid znw equal to ρ w zw ρ nw for drainage experiments the non wetting reservoir base level was progressively increased by z 0 02 m steps which represents 20 pa and 18 pa variations at 293 15 k and 323 15 k respectively the volume balance between the non wetting phase level znw and wetting phase level zw gave the saturation change between two successive steps this process was repeated until no difference could be observed between the non wetting and wetting reservoir volume variations the levels of non wetting and wetting fluids could be determined with a precision of 1 mm the irreducible wetting saturation sir w was measured as the difference between initial and produced volumes of the wetting phase reservoir during drainage for imbibition experiments the non wetting phase reservoir base level was decreased by 0 02 m steps this time the difference between the initially injected non wetting phase volume and the volume produced during the imbibition gave the residual non wetting saturation sr nw the time step between each height change is an important parameter for achieving the equilibrium condition this time step was kept constant for experimental repeatability to choose this time step we measured the level of the interface inside the 1d cell after a 0 02 m step this level was stationary 3 hours after changing the non wetting phase reservoir for coal tar water and 1 hour for oil ethanol during imbibition we saw slightly low stabilization times during drainages this is mainly due to the influence of gravity drainages are produced upwards imbibitions downwards hence the reservoir level was changed when the saturation in the cell was constant these experimental conditions have been chosen in order to keep a capillary dominant process inside the cell the heights measurements were corrected for the evaporation rate using a reference reservoir to quantify water level change because of evaporation also we limited evaporation by closing the end of the reservoirs with a perforated plastic cap as pointed out before the reservoirs were made with pvdf which is hydrophobic therefore the volume attached to the reservoir wall is not significant and was not considered for hydrostatic pressure measurement for canola oil ethanol and coal tar water two sets of three cell experiments were carried out at 293 15 k and 323 15 k the whole setup was placed in an oven when heated at 323 15 k each set consisted of two successive drainages and imbibitions for the first set of experiments the temperature was kept at 293 15 k for the whole experiment for the second set the primary drainage was performed at 293 15 k but the temperature was increased to 323 15 k from the first imbibition for each experimental case capillary pressure versus saturation datasets were fitted on van genuchten empirical model using a levenberg marquardt algorithm lma written in python 18 s w s i r w 1 s i r w s r n w 1 α h c n 1 1 n we found that this model gave the best least squares residuals out of all tested for our data van genuchten parameters α n and residual saturations have been averaged for each experiment 3 3 dynamic pumping experiment procedure in this case the drainage and imbibition experiments were done only for the oil ethanol system as coal tar was completely opaque and the imaging procedure was not suitable for determining coal tar saturation inside the cell for both drainage and imbibition we used three constant flow rates at room temperature 6 12 24 ml min at 293 15 k in a clockwise motion after injecting 2 pore volumes the pump s direction of rotation was changed to recover the non wetting phase imbibition oil ethanol imbibition was also carried out at 12 ml min at 323 15 k to study the effect of temperature fig 6 presents photographs of the cell during the dynamic experiments the interface between salty ethanol and canola oil observed during drainages was stable for all cases only two pore volumes were needed to reach irreducible ethanol saturation however imbibitions were unstable and prone to viscous fingering ten pore volumes were pumped during imbibition in all cases the pressure difference initially increased because of the ethanol injection until a value of 3800 pa the pressure was read every 6 seconds we observed substantial oscillations on the pressure readings due to the pump s peristaltic motion a digital low pass filter with a cut frequency equal to the cycle frequency of the pump was applied to the data to remove these artefacts the sum of the wetting and non wetting phase outlet masses was measured continuously during the experiment the mass was measured every 6 seconds during both drainage and imbibition 3 4 saturation measurements using imaging saturation was determined inside the 2d small cell with an imaging technique a nikon d810 with nikkor lens 105 nikon digital camera which has a 34 megapixel resolution was used for optical imaging images were acquired every 30 seconds during the injection or pumping of the non wetting phase the experiments were performed in a dark room with two light spots 2 300 w broncolor camera parameters and lighting conditions were identical for all experiments light transmission and light reflection methods have both been used in the past to observe two phase flow processes in porous media geel and sykes 1994 darnault et al 1998 wu et al 2017 in this study the light reflection method lrm was used the main idea of imaging analysis is to determine a relationship between light intensity and wetting phase saturation sw previous work found an exponential relationship between light intensity and saturation gerhard and kueper 2003 colombano et al 2020 the images were in rgb but were transformed in 8 bit images for image analysis the mean gray values were obtained using fiji freeware the following procedure was applied for image analysis of photos from the same experiments adjust or correct lighting differences with the 8 grayscale levels the black and white square correspond to the reflectance of 18 9 and 98 2 respectively as reference values determine the pixel area to be analyzed the pixel area has to be big enough to avoid microscale effects but at the same time not too big to avoid shadows and non uniform lighting the mean gray value averaged over the pixel area was plotted before analyzing images this plot was used to determine an area where the mean gray value was constant use a calibration curve to determine the wetting phase saturation inside the cell for the calibration we took images of cells containing a known volume fraction of glass beads and liquids for each saturation endpoints sw sir w or sw 1 sr nw the cell was uniformly saturated and the reflected light intensity was measured fig b 1 the optical density was defined as the ratio between this measured intensity and the intensity of a white reference 98 2 for oil and ethanol we found a linear relationship sw 2 63 od 2 34 with a coefficient of determination r² close to 1 r² 0 95 this result means ethanol saturation can be determined directly from light intensity measurements this property is useful in order for measuring saturation especially in dynamic conditions for both fluid pairs the relationship between optical density and saturation was measured at 293 15 k and 323 15 k we saw no effect of temperature on the relationship between optical density and saturation 4 results discussion 4 1 effect of temperature on quasi static capillary pressure saturation curves an example of the capillary pressure saturation curves is plotted in fig 7 at 293 15 k for coal tar water the experimental data from all three experiments are presented by crosses exp without distinction however van genuchten parameters were obtained for each experiment separately and then were averaged solid and dashed lines fitted van genuchten parameters irreducible and residual saturations are summarized in table 1 for all experiments this model uses two fitting parameters α m 1 and n which are related to the inverse of the entry pressure and the homogeneity of the porous medium respectively for oil ethanol and coal tar water experiments α values are different this result is coherent because their corresponding measured values of interfacial tension are not the same the parameter n is also much higher for coal tar water than for oil ethanol wetting irreducible and non wetting residual saturations are almost the same when comparing the same case for both fluid pairs following dury et al 1998 we also calculated β coefficients table 1 the ratio between the inverse of α and the interfacial tension for all experiments this ratio is used to scale existing capillary curves to other fluid pairs in our case we found that the values are slightly higher for oil ethanol than coal tar water thus using the scaling procedure it is not possible to get coal tar water capillary pressure saturation curves from oil ethanol ones our results indicate that the scaling laws are not suitable when using complex fluids like coal tar for canola oil ethanol and coal tar water the differences observed in capillary pressure saturation curves between 293 15 k and 323 15 k are within the standard deviation and could not be attributed to temperature effect fig 8 however for coal tar water and the same water saturation values the capillary pressure is lower at 323 15 k than at 293 15 k the previous measurements indicate that temperature changes are almost negligible for density interfacial tension and contact angle between 293 15 k and 323 15 k we showed before that only dynamic viscosity was influenced by temperature changes however the dependency of the dynamic viscosity on temperature did not influence the capillary pressure saturation curves in static conditions the small difference between coal tar water curves at 293 15 k and 323 15 k might be explained by either the heterogeneity of coal tar or alteration of the coal tar water mixture at a higher temperature density dynamic viscosity interfacial tension and contact angle results were used to calculate the relevant dimensionless numbers related to imbibition experiments table 2 bond number bo and viscosity ratio m could be calculated directly with the measured parameters the intrinsic velocity calculated with darcy law was used to calculate ca numbers the pressure difference used in this expression is the same as the one used in our experiments the resulting definition for ca is thus equivalent to the one proposed in chatzis and morrow 1984 since drainage is mostly a stable process due to a favorable viscosity ratio dimensionless numbers will be calculated in the case of imbibition to verify the validity of darcy s law we found the bond number to be slightly below 1 due to the small difference in density between the two phases the flow between coal tar water and oil ethanol in 1 mm glass beads can therefore be described by darcy s law oil ethanol bond number increases with temperature while that of coal tar water decreases this can be explained by the fact that the density difference ρ nw ρ w increases with temperature in the case of oil ethanol but decreases for coal tar water the capillary number has been found to be low enough 10 5 to justify that capillary forces prevail rather than viscous forces at the pore scale in addition no emergence of viscous fingers has been noted during the small pressure step experiments thus we can conclude that measurements of capillary pressure saturation in our case has been done with respect to hypothesis behind generalized darcy s law namely the fact that the interface between both liquid phases is rigid and no fingering occurs it has been found that viscosity ratio during imbibition decreases by a factor 3 for coal tar water and a factor of 2 for oil ethanol here the influence of temperature on the viscosity ratio was not as high as expected those variations were not sufficient to change the order of magnitude of the dimensionless values and to change the residual saturations increasing the temperature has two consequences for the imbibition process increasing the viscosity ratio and decreasing the capillary number also it appears that the effect of temperature on residual non wetting phase saturation sr nw was almost negligible in both cases however previous viscous lnapl and dnapl displacement experiments have shown that the injection of hot water increases the recovery rate of the contaminant and reduces the residual saturation jabbour et al 1996 o carroll and sleep 2007 the experiments are done here by increasing the capillary pressure with small pressure steps several weeks are needed to complete a drainage and imbibition cycle experiment the capillary numbers in our quasi static experiments are still low ca 1 which corresponds to a capillary fingering regime in this case the displacement structure is controlled by the fluctuations in the capillary threshold pressures at the displacement front thus the viscosity ratio does not have a visible effect on the results however for high invasion rates the dependence on m may become relevant because of the viscous dominated displacement in addition the dimensionless numbers between coal tar water and oil ethanol are quite close considering that oil and coal tar are both non wetting fluids the same residual saturations and capillary curves between both fluid pairs should be expected the use of oil ethanol as a model fluid pair is thereby justified 4 2 dynamic effect on two phase flow properties as previously noted two pore volumes pv were needed to reach ethanol irreducible saturation the injection of oil from the bottom drainage into the porous column saturated with ethanol was found to be a stable process at all flow rates during this step only ethanol was produced from the cell outlet and as soon as oil reached the cell outlet only oil was the displacement front was stable due to gravity effects and because oil s dynamic viscosity is higher than ethanol s m 1 we saw a completely different trend for the injection of 10 pv of ethanol from the top of the cell imbibition the following observations were observed for the smallest flow rate 6 ml min the injection of 10 pv of ethanol lasted 38 minutes only oil was recovered during the first 6 minutes 0 to 1 6 pv after that ethanol bubbles started to flow out separately from the system until 10 minutes 1 6 to 2 6 pv then ethanol and oil were both recovered as separate phases at the same time in the tubing oil was flowing near the walls while ethanol was recovered near the center 2 6 to 4 pv finally after pumping for 15 minutes 4 to 10 pv only ethanol was produced for the rest of the injection and the oil saturation did not change these saturation changes during oil injection a and pumping b are shown in fig 9 for different flow rates and temperature values the error bars show the difference between the saturation values calculated from the imaging technique and mass balance for all saturation points the maximum saturation difference between both methods is 0 05 1 ml which validates the proposed imaging technique to determine liquid saturation inside the cell as shown in fig 9a the irreducible saturation sir w has been found not to depend on the flow rate its value varied between 0 03 at 6 ml min and 0 07 at 24 ml min also when the pump was stopped between the injection and pumping steps there was a small time window where a saturation change occurred this effect was even more noticeable for a low flow rate during this time we noticed saturation redistribution inside the cell likely due to end effects there are indeed local saturation gradients inside the cell at pore scale that are more important in dynamic conditions however we do not take it into account because we mostly focused our study on macroscopic characteristics and measure the mean saturation over the whole cell conversely oil pumping heavily depends on both flow rate and temperature fig 9b first higher oil residual saturations were obtained for higher flow rates during the experiments more ethanol fingers swept a lower area at a high flow rate this phenomenon had already been observed and confirmed by doorwar and mohanty 2015 consequently oil saturation decreased at a slower rate even though the pumping rate was higher another important point is that residual saturation was obtained with lower pore volumes for low flow rates almost 8 pv were needed to reach sr o 0 29 at 24 ml min while only 5 pv were needed with sr o 0 06 at 6 ml min the comparison between both profiles at 12 ml min one obtained at 293 15 k and the other 323 15 k shows that temperature had two effects the oil recovery rate was increased at high temperature during our fluid characterization we noted that only the viscosity ratio decreased with temperature thus fewer fingers are formed during the injection of ethanol inside oil at 323 15 k and a higher volume of oil is recovered from the cell in addition the residual saturation is smaller at high temperature 0 06 at 323 15 k vs 0 15 at 293 15 k however as we see before the temperature had no effect on the residual saturation in the quasi static experiments thus from a certain flow rate capillary number where the dynamic effect becomes important the temperature significantly affects the residual saturation finally the results also underline that with increasing temperature which leads to a lower viscosity ratio oil recovery is enhanced at even higher flow rates this means that the remediation time is shortened at higher temperatures the pressure differences between the inlet and outlet of the cell vs saturation curves during oil injection a and pumping b are presented in fig 10 for different flow rates and temperature values as mentioned before we ran the experiments with a volumetric pump this type of pump keeps a constant flow rate and pressure adapts itself in consequence thus a higher injection flow rate leads to a higher pressure difference in the system conversely if the pumping flow rate is high the depression needed will be bigger and can go under atmospheric pressure defined as a relative pressure equal to 0 pa here it is also interesting to note that the pressure required to rotate the pump at 12 ml min was also lower for higher temperature value 323 15 k the cell was at zero oil saturation at the beginning of the oil injection fig 8a the pressure difference inside the cell slowly increased almost linearly until irreducible wetting ethanol saturation the prescribed flow rate at the pump increased the measured pressure difference inside the cell but no difference in saturation values was observed at irreducible ethanol saturation the pressure still increased due to the rise of ethanol level inside the ethanol reservoir situated above the cell the cell was at irreducible wetting saturation at the beginning of the oil pumping fig 8b the pressure difference fell almost immediately as soon as pumping began a higher flow rate translated into a higher initial pressure drop then the pressure difference increased linearly until ethanol breakthrough time at which ethanol starts to be recovered the pressure difference stabilized at non wetting oil residual saturation the pressure needed to pump oil from the cell at 323 15 k was lower than that at 293 15 k this effect is mainly linked to the reduction of dynamic viscosity it is possible to interpret this from another point of view the recovery rate of oil would be higher at 323 15 k than at 293 15 k initially but the pumping done with the highest flow rate 26 ml min is also the pumping that generated the highest residual oil saturation 0 29 a certain balance between operating pressure and temperature needs to be determined for viscous dnapls in permeable media to recover the largest volume from the porous media in the smallest time a summary of all experiments dimensionless numbers irreducible saturations sir w and residual saturations sr o obtained in this work are presented in table 3 for dynamic experiments the characteristic velocity was considered equal to the pump flow rate in m3 s divided by the porous medium section 5 6 cm 2 5 cm for capillary number calculations as seen before for quasi static experiments the bond number can be considered constant this is because the parameters contributing to capillary forces interfacial tension wettability pore geometry are invariant with temperature capillary numbers during dynamic experiments were very high ca 10 2 compared to quasi static ones ca 10 5 viscous forces were much more predominant than capillary forces in that case it should be noted that the reported capillary numbers were obtained in one dimensional flow conditions in a real site the velocity field will change depending on the radial distance from the well studies in 2d and 3d experimental setups are needed to better understand the governing conditions that may impact the dynamic effects in real sites during injection the flow rates tested gave almost zero irreducible saturation the oil was able to sweep almost all the ethanol initially inside the cell the capillary number and mobility ratio were both important to determine the effect of temperature on residual saturation in this case first the flow rate increased ca increased leading to a higher residual saturation due to thinner and longer viscous fingers then the dimensionless numbers were almost the same at 6 ml min at 293 15 k and 12 ml min at 323 15 k thus it is logical to obtain the same residual saturation however it took 10 minutes to reach this value at 323 15 k instead of 40 minutes at 6 ml min at 293 15 k validating the use of temperature as a way to enhance dnapl pumping the generalized darcy s law with the use of relative permeability is often used in order to understand the effect of temperature however in the case of injection or pumping in highly permeable media dynamic effects must be considered and cannot be represented by this law accurately the theoretical notion of relative permeability is compromised due to the presence of viscous fingering and ethanol films around the glass beads in this situation it is difficult to admit the hypothesis that both phases are flowing separately in the medium the fact that temperature reduces oil residual saturation appears to be linked to this also we noted the presence of ethanol films in all experiments under dynamic conditions these films are generally not taken into account in numerical studies considering the effect of temperature their emergence was even higher when the temperature had been increased no experimental study has been conducted on fluid film behavior and it is therefore difficult to highlight if this is an experimental artifact due to the fluids used or a phenomenon that should be taken into account yet when approaching residual saturation values the number of films decreases and becomes even less visible as the capillary number becomes high the presence of these films has been observed in the past in trickle bed reactors reinecke and mewes 1997 the solid particle size used in this type of reactors is in the millimeter range like the ones studied here this leads us to conclude that the presence and retention of these films inside a porous medium are mostly linked to the high capillary number encountered in highly permeable porous media moura et al 2019 have also observed the presence of capillary bridges during drainage experiments their results show that film flow can enhance the recovery of the trapped liquid moura et al 2019 this is coherent with our observations more films are present during imbibition at 323 15 k than at 293 15 k and the resulting ethanol saturation is then reduced pressure difference and ethanol saturation data have been used in order to determine relative permeability curves with the jbn method welge 1952 johnson et al 1959 qin et al 2018 previously measured oil and water relative permeabilities in sand packs and determined that temperature effectively increases both fluids relative permeabilities qin et al 2018 fig 11 represents the effect of temperature on oil and ethanol relative permeability measured in pumping conditions at 12 ml min oil relative permeabilities have been found to have an exponential profile at 293 15 k and an almost linear profile at 323 15 k ethanol relative permeabilities have a small magnitude compared to oil relative permeability due to the high viscosity ratio considered in our study in addition ethanol relative permeability increases with temperature for all saturations oil and ethanol relative permeabilities are higher at 323 15 k rather than at 293 15 k this is due to the difference in saturation profiles between pumping at 293 15 k and 323 15 k both oil and ethanol are thus able to flow at a faster rate in pumping applications for higher temperature 5 conclusion changing soil temperature during dnapl pure phase recovery involves analyses of the parameters used in generalized darcy s law hypotheses behind the use of this equation were recalled and it appears that in soil remediation applications wetting phase film and viscous fingering may appear under dynamic conditions the influence of temperature on a coal tar sampled from a field was investigated density dynamic viscosity interfacial tension and contact angle parameters for coal tar water and oil ethanol a model two phase liquid have been measured between 293 15 k and 323 15 k dynamic viscosities of all studied liquids decrease exponentially with temperature liquids densities and interfacial tensions between the two immiscible coupled fluids decrease linearly with temperature these parameters are all important in the capillary and viscous forces balance determining the flow regime the studies on the expected flow pattern have been investigated by lenormand et al 1988 the further analysis of dimensionless numbers between both fluid pairs showed that it is possible to use oil and ethanol as a model fluid for studying coal tar water two phase flow in porous media we performed drainage and imbibition experiments in a 1d porous cell under almost quasi static ca 10 5 conditions and in the application range of generalized darcy s law during the experiments no viscous fingering was noted nor was a temperature effect observed on two phase flow van genuchten parameters or residual saturations for both couples of liquids at 293 15 k and 323 15 k it should be noted that capillary forces are relatively small in these cases this is because of the highly permeable porous medium used and the low interfacial tension of the considered liquids in all our drainage imbibition experiments the residual saturations and observations obtained with canola oil and ethanol experiments were close to the ones observed with coal tar and water however it is considerably easier to obtain results with simple and almost not toxic liquids like canola oil and ethanol especially by image analyzing techniques this type of simplification is done with glass beads in experiments to model a simpler and inert porous medium with the same permeability and porosity finally we further studied the effect of temperature by pumping oil in the small cell filled by the glass beads at irreducible ethanol saturation and 323 15 k increasing the temperature reduces the pressure difference needed to reach the same pumping rate increases the recovery rate of oil from the porous medium sr o 16 down to 6 when heating from 293 15 k to 323 15 k and finally increases both oil and ethanol relative permeabilities the higher recovery rate is linked not only to reduced viscous fingering but also to the presence of interfacial films that seem to appear because of the high capillary numbers ca 10 2 encountered in highly permeable media residual saturation has also been found to decrease considerably due to decreasing the viscous fingering occurred at low flow rate the presence and growth of viscous fingerings allow the ethanol to flush a larger part of the medium the experiments performed under dynamic conditions have shown that dynamic effects are important when considering temperature effects during pumping operations in complement to our study which focuses on macroscopic quantities it would be interesting to extract local and microscopic quantities to investigate more thoroughly the impact of temperature on two phase flow in a real site the coupling between heat transfers and two phase flow should be also considered in order to better understand the physical mechanisms happening during thermally enhanced dnapl pumping credit authorship

385,the remediation of aquifers contaminated by viscous dense non aqueous phase liquids dnapls is a challenging problem coal tars are the most abundant persistent dnapls due to their high viscosity and complexity pumping processes leave considerable volume fractions of dnapls in the soil and demand high operational costs to reach cleaning objectives thermally enhanced recovery focuses on decreasing dnapl viscosity to reduce residual saturation the oil industry has previously applied this technique with great success for enhanced oil recovery applications however in soil remediation high porous media permeabilities and product densities may invalidate those techniques additionally the impacts of temperature on coal tar s physical properties have not been thoroughly discussed in available literature here we investigated how coal tar s physical properties the capillary pressure saturation curve and the relative permeability of two phase flow in porous media depend on the temperature and flow rate experimentally drainage and imbibition experiments under quasi static steady state and dynamic unsteady state conditions have been carried out at 293 15 k and 323 15 k in a 1d small cell filled with 1 mm homogeneous glass beads two different pairs of immiscible fluids have been investigated coal tar water and canola oil ethanol results demonstrated similar trends for temperature effect and values of fluid properties for both liquid pairs which backs up the use of canola oil ethanol to model coal tar water flow it was found that there is no temperature effect on drainage imbibition curves or residual saturation under quasi static conditions in dynamic conditions the dnapl residual saturation decreased by 16 when the temperature changed from 293 15 k to 323 15 k this drop was mainly linked to decreasing viscous fingering as well as the appearance of wetting phase films around the glass beads both phenomena have been observed only in dynamic experiments a high enough pumping flow rate is needed to generate dynamic effects in the porous medium ethanol and oil s relative permeabilities also increase with temperature under dynamic measurement conditions our findings indicate that flow rate is an important parameter to consider in thermal enhanced recovery processes these effects are not taken into account in the classically used generalized darcy s

phase ethanol or water w water nw non wetting phase canola oil or coal tar 1 introduction dense non aqueous phase liquids dnapls are liquids denser than water and slightly soluble in water due to their high density dnapls can deeply sink into the subsurface until reaching a less permeable layer and form a non aqueous reservoir subsurface zones contaminated by dnapls are generally hard to delimit due to soil heterogeneity soil dispersion and the substantial depth of the contamination combined with gravity driven finger flow thus remediating these pollutants in the aquifer is a complicated matter dnapl source zones are even more problematic because they may keep on dissolving toxic compounds into the groundwater ultimately future health and environmental problems can arise such as drinking water contamination or soil quality degradation commonly reported dnapl contaminants include chlorinated solvents namely trichloroethylene tce and tetrachloroethylene pce that were previously widely used as solvents for organic materials schwille and pankow 1988 coal tars are also a notable dnapl found in the subsurface and are also more viscous than water brown et al 2006 have measured coal tar s dynamic viscosity on multiple sites and have found that the coal tar water viscosity ratio can vary between 10 and 106 brown et al 2006 this range is linked to the chemical heterogeneity in coal tar diagnosis and risk assessment are hard because the exact composition of coal tar is generally not identifiable hence a site polluted by coal tar is difficult to clean up and the choice for an applicable recovery method has to be made on a case by case basis in our study the focus is on coal tar source zones with high pollutant concentrations pumping in the subsurface through production wells is a primary step used in remediation operations however the pumping rate is very low for dnapls and the remediation could take tens to hundreds of years which is economically unsatisfying usepa 1996 russell and rabideau 2000 kavanaugh and kresic 2008 navy 2008 newell et al 2011 the most efficient current methods for remediating dnapl source zones are thermal treatments ding et al 2019 generally temperature is increased to vaporize mcdade et al 2005 baker et al 2006 baston et al 2010 or even burn rein 2009 switzer et al 2009 hasan et al 2015 scholes et al 2015 the pollutant the vapors generated are then collected and treated with carbon activated filters however generating high temperature fields can be dangerous for the nutritional and biological functions of the soil pape et al 2015 have shown that even if a contaminant can be completely treated at 773 15 k the soil is unusable for future construction or industrial operations o carroll et al 2005 pape et al 2015 as a result napl residual saturation is lower in the soil after a thermally enhanced process afterwards the high soil temperature can increase the degradation rate of chemical treatments oxidation surfactant flooding and biological methods bio or phytoremediation melin et al 1998 hot water flooding is another technique that has shown success in treating viscous napls light or dense contamination the idea is to reduce the dynamic viscosity of the napl by increasing its temperature during pumping the hot water will progressively replace the napl and leave residual napl saturation in the soil previous authors have shown that injecting hot water increases total napl recovery volumes by pumping processes fulton and reuter 1991 davis 1997 o carroll and sleep 2007 pumping a dnapl phase from the subsurface can be represented by an imbibition process in porous media the dnapl phase is progressively pushed away from the soil and the water slowly fills the pores left vacant thus it is important to analyze and better understand fluid displacements before drawing any conclusions to characterize the behavior of the physical system composed of dnapl water and a solid matrix is still an ongoing challenge in fluid mechanics currently modelling is based on the theory of immiscible multiphase flow in porous media in our case dnapl and water are represented as two separate phases and the soil is an immobile solid matrix in which both liquids may flow for this type of engineering application the simultaneous flow of dnapl and water in a porous medium is commonly described using the generalization of darcy s law to multiphase flow for each phase muskat and meres 1936 1 u i k k r i s i μ i p i ρ i g where u i is the darcy velocity m s 1 g the gravitational acceleration k the permeability tensor m2 pi the pressure pa μ i and ρ i respectively the dynamic viscosity pa s and density kg m 3 the subscript i designates the water or dnapl phase the main difference between darcy s law and its extension to multiphase flow is the addition of relative permeability terms k r i it signifies that each phase flows independently through a virtual porous medium of permeability kk r i si the dnapl occupies a part of the total pore space depending on its saturation which reduces the volume of water that can flow through and vice versa this equation generally holds true when there is no momentum transfer at the interface of both fluid phases whitaker 1986 the presence of the two fluid phases results in an interface that is subjected to interfacial tension at the pore scale this interface also causes a pressure discontinuity at the macroscale with respect to capillary pressure pc this is subsequently defined as the difference between the pressure of the non wetting fluid pnw and the pressure of the wetting fluid pw 2 p n w p w p c s w immiscible dnapls flowing in the aquifer can be assimilated to a two phase flow in porous media the dimensionless numbers controlling the actual flow pattern are respectively bond number bo capillary number ca and viscosity ratio m in the case of the imbibition of a wetting phase inside a porous medium saturated with a non wetting phase these numbers can be written as 3 b o ρ n w ρ w g l 2 γ 4 c a v c μ i n v γ 5 m μ i n v μ d i s l is a characteristic length in unconsolidated media like glass beads l is often chosen equal to the mean particle diameter γ is the interfacial tension between both liquid phases vc is a characteristic velocity representing the order of magnitude of the flow rate inside the pores the subscripts inv and dis respectively represent the invading and displaced phase in this work the dnapl and water are the invading phases during drainage and imbibition respectively alternatively the viscosity ratio may be replaced by the mobility ratio the ratio between relative permeability and viscosity the latter includes relative permeabilities in its calculation and can be more suitable for real porous media hagoort 1974 it is possible to identify flow regimes depending on the order of magnitude of each number the different types of two phase flow that occur in micro models are classified as capillary fingering viscous fingering and stable displacement lenormand et al 1988 according to the authors the type of flow that promotes maximum coal tar recovery and minimizes residual dnapl saturation is stable displacement which occurs only for m 1 and ca 10 4 in practice coal tar is much more viscous than water and m 1 in the case of pumping coal tar the main objective of thermally enhanced oil recovery is therefore to reduce this viscosity ratio in order to decrease the mobility ratio and to promote stable displacement in the porous medium the effect of temperature on bond and capillary number should also be estimated in order to link those to the benefits of thermal enhancement mclaren et al 2009 found that for a soil consisting of london clays an increase from 12 c to 30 c not only reduces the kinematic viscosity of a coal tar from 10 4 m2 s 1 to 10 5 m2 s 1 but also significantly reduces the residual saturation despite a small variation in the capillary effect mclaren et al 2009 davis 1994 experimentally obtained a decrease in residual dnapl saturation by heating from 10 c to 30 c without any temperature effect on interfacial tension davis 1994 sleep and ma 1997 found only a 10 change in the interfacial tension of the pce water pair when heated from 20 c to 90 c sleep and ma 1997 bachmann et al 2002 suggest that the decrease in residual saturation is also related to a decrease in the contact angle it can decrease by 0 03 c for sand and up to 0 26 c for silts bachmann et al 2002 more recently colombano et al 2020 studied the thermally enhanced recovery of heavy chlorinated solvents in a highly permeable porous medium and observed no effect of temperature on residual saturation on quasi static drainage and imbibition conditions colombano et al 2020 a few similar studies have been proposed in the past for viscous oil recovery koci et al 1989 studied the effect of temperature on oil water in unconsolidated porous media sand between 298 15 k and 443 15 k the main findings were that raising temperature increased the irreducible water saturation but also decreased the residual oil saturation and the relative oil permeability koci et al 1989 wang et al 2006 investigated the effect of oil viscosity on relative permeability curves for oil water in sand packs the measurements were made at constant flow rate the decrease in oil viscosity was linked to an increase in both oil and water relative permeability curves wang et al 2006 the impact of temperature on oil water relative permeability interfacial tension and wettability has been reviewed by esmaeili et al 2019 observations on the effect of temperature on two phase flow in porous media were mainly linked to variations in those parameters therefore it is very difficult to extend the findings from literature reviews on different liquids to a complex liquid such as coal tar also some authors pointed out that a lot of relative permeability available data is not exact due to the presence of experimental artifacts e g viscous fingering capillary end effects wettability and pore distribution changes due to temperature variations specifically reliable relative permeability measurements require a flow regime dominated by capillary forces at the pore scale eq 1 is only valid for low capillary numbers davit and quintard 2019 oil reservoirs generally have low permeability less than 10 11 m2 the velocity is generally low enough to validate the hypothesis behind the use of generalized darcy s law however in the case of soil remediation the napl phase is present due to a spill and is often found in highly permeable zones in the subsurface above 10 11 m2 for instance in our application case coal tar was pumped in alluvial sands with a permeability of 10 9 m2 the use of generalized darcy s law and eq 2 implies a quasi static assumption the interface between both fluid phases is described by a succession of quasi static thermodynamic states without any dependence on time capillary effects are predominant at the pore scale and are represented at macroscale using eq 2 relative permeabilities represent viscous effects to generalize darcy s law to multiphase flow however this assumption is not always satisfied when considering multiphase flows in a transient process for instance when considering pumping napl in the subsurface the capillary number will be obviously very high near the production well the main objective of this work is to measure changes in the physical properties of coal tar caused by temperature variations and to relate those to two phase flow properties in highly permeable porous media we explored how temperature influences the capillary pressure saturation and relative permeability curves under quasi static two phase flow conditions our goal was to better understand and characterize the two phase flow in highly permeable porous media with a focus on temperature first we determined the properties of coal tar sampled from a real polluted site section 2 data on its density dynamic viscosity interfacial tension with water and contact angle with water on a glass slide were measured between 293 15 k and 323 15 k then we describe an experimental setup that has been used to study two phase flow in porous media in isothermal conditions section 3 we conducted experiments at two temperatures 293 15 k and 323 15 k under quasi static conditions then we carried out drainage and imbibition tests at different flow rates and temperatures to study the effect of temperature on two phase flow under dynamic conditions finally we summarize the results including the capillary pressure saturation relationship analysis of used dimensionless numbers and a discussion on saturation and pressure time profiles as well as relative permeability curves obtained under dynamic conditions section 4 2 fluid characterization as a function of temperature 2 1 fluid selection and properties the main couple of liquids for this study is coal tar and water coal tars are pyrolysis by products polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons pahs are the main chemical compounds found in coal tars previous studies on coal tars indicate that their physical properties depend on their chemical origin and the geology of the source zones kong 2004 in addition the complete chemical composition of coal tars is hard to determine by analytical means johansson et al 2019 we used a coal tar sample produced from a well situated in a former coke plant suspended solid particles were removed from the sample using a glass fiber membrane gf d 2 7 µm pore size some water was also collected during coal tar sampling the water contained inside the sample was filtered out with a vacuum pump and a 10 μm pore size hydrophobic ptfe membrane the resulting sample containing only coal tar was kept in a cold room at 277 15 k to limit chemical reaction rates evaporation and variations in physical properties during the study degassed tap water was used in all coal tar and water flow in porous media experiments ultrapure water was also considered for the experiments but was not suitable because coal tar dissolves partially in it dnapls like coal tar are generally difficult to experiment with due to their high toxicity and their adhesion on laboratory glassware as previously mentioned coal tar has generally an unknown and very heterogeneous composition it has also been observed that the composition of coal tar can change in the experimental setups therefore we chose a model fluid pair made of two immiscible pure compounds canola oil and ethanol virgin canola oil was used as the substitute for coal tar non wetting fluid the choice of virgin oil was motivated by the fact that refined canola oil was found to change color when heated vegetable oils have however a lower density than water thus we chose to work with ethanol as the wetting fluid sodium chloride was dissolved into the ethanol at room temperature 293 15 k at a concentration of 0 65 g kg the addition of salt was required to measure soil resistivity in a parallel study iravani et al 2020 from this point water and salty ethanol will be referred to as the wetting phase coal tar and canola oil will be referred to as the non wetting phase 2 2 density we measured all the densities coal tar water salty ethanol canola oil using a pycnometer 25 ml 0 04 ml and an analytical balance 0 01 g the pycnometer was first calibrated with ultrapure water at room temperature 293 15 k density values were then measured at the same temperature the effect of temperature on density was determined by placing the liquid inside an insulated closet initially at 293 15 k the temperature of the closet was increased by steps of 10 k and the density was then measured with the same pycnometer the procedure was repeated until reaching 323 15 k in triplicate per liquid finally measurements were also acquired at 277 15 k by placing the sample in a cold room fig 1 presents the density measurements as a function of temperature for ethanol canola oil water and coal tar coal tar has a higher density than water at all temperatures tested in this study therefore coal tar behaves as a dnapl in the polluted aquifer zone the coal tar density values measured in this study were close to previously reported measurements at 295 15 k 308 15 k and 323 15 k kong 2004 linear regression was applied using the least squares method we observed that ethanol canola oil water and coal tar densities decrease almost linearly when their temperature increases from 277 15 k to 323 15 k the measurements indicate that the volumetric thermal expansion coefficient can be considered constant for these fluids for each fluid the estimated correlations are the following with temperature in kelvin 6 ρ c t t 1237 0 4818 t 7 ρ w t 1073 0 2598 t 8 ρ e t 990 3 0 6224 t 9 ρ o t 1059 0 5033 t 2 3 dynamic viscosity we measured all the dynamic viscosities coal tar water salty ethanol canola oil using a rotational rheometer thermo scientific haake mars iii and cone plate geometry the plate was connected to thermoelectric cooling peltier effect in order to reach temperatures between 283 15 k and 323 15 k the rheometer applied a constant shear rate and measured the responding shear stress of the liquid correct calibration of the gap between the cone and the plate is of great importance for precise measurements in our study this gap can change due to thermal expansion thus we first heated the plate to the desired temperature then calibrated the gap prior to measurements finally the liquid sample 2 ml was injected onto the plate the range of the shear rate measurements was comprised between 10 s 1 and 100 s 1 for newtonian fluids the shear stress is proportional to the shear rate in this case the dynamic viscosity μ is defined as a constant proportionality factor between both parameters first coal tar shear stress was determined at 293 15 k for shear rates varying from 10 s 1 to 100 s 1 the shear stress increased proportionally as the shear rate increases thus the coal tar sampled in this study displays the behavior of a newtonian fluid between 283 15 k and 323 15 k previous studies have found that liquid coal tar is shear thinning bhatia et al 1977 fitzer et al 1987 the difference in behavior found here may be due to either the historical origin of the coal tar sample or the focus on a lower temperature 283 15 k compared to these studies 373 15 k fig 2 presents the effect of temperature on the dynamic viscosities of ethanol canola oil water and coal tar dynamic viscosities decreased while temperature increased in all fluids the andrade equation two parameters empirical exponential model was used to fit viscosity data andrade 1940 the relative changes of dynamic viscosity due to temperature were found to be close for non wetting liquids canola oil and coal tar and also wetting liquids ethanol and water 10 μ c t t 1 71 10 8 e 4 37 10 3 t 11 μ w t 9 82 10 7 e 2 03 10 3 t 12 μ e t 1 22 10 6 e 2 16 10 3 t 13 μ o t 1 60 10 7 e 3 96 10 3 t 2 4 interfacial tension and contact angle interfacial tension and contact angles measurements were made with a drop shape analyzer krüss dsa 100 the apparatus consists of a light source a camera and the sample provided by a syringe a drop of the non wetting fluid coal tar or canola oil is injected into a bath filled with the wetting fluid water or salty ethanol the bath and the syringe are surrounded by an insulated chamber the chamber is connected to a thermostat which can change the measuring temperature between 285 15 k and 323 15 k the accuracy for interfacial tension contact angle and temperature measurements are respectively 0 3 mn m 0 3 and 0 1 k a camera controlled by krüss advance software is able to detect the drop and shape contours from images for interfacial tension and contact angle measurements the calibration of the apparatus was checked by measuring pure water s surface tension between 285 15 k and 323 15 k for interfacial tension measurements a 1 mm diameter ptfe needle was used a non wetting drop was formed at the tip of the needle directly inside the wetting fluid the choices of needle diameter and drop volume were motivated by a previous work berry et al 2015 the measurements were done in triplicate for each target temperature the measurements were then acquired every minute and averaged over one hour the interfacial tension was determined with young laplace equation the method used by krüss advance software automatically detects the drop in the image and fit shape factor in order to reproduce its contour the interfacial tension is then calculated from 14 γ δ ρ g r 0 2 β where δρ is the difference between densities of the two phases g the standard acceleration due to gravity r0 the drop radius at its apex β a shape factor for contact angle measurements a glass slide was introduced inside the wetting fluid water and ethanol bath a non wetting fluid dnapl and canola oil drop was then injected on the glass slide the drop shape was reproduced by krüss software using the previously introduced young laplace equation the contact angle was measured as the angle between the detected contour and baseline represented by the horizontal glass slide pure water air surface tension measurements were in agreement with previous ones made by vargaftik et al 1983 this validates the proposed experimental apparatus and our protocol prior to temperature measurements interfacial tension was measured against time for a coal tar tap water system over 200 minutes at 293 15 k and 323 15 k the interfacial tension decreased in both cases as coal tar ages in tap water this change in interfacial tension results from a small amount of coal tar dissolving rate into the water at the interface the measurements could not be taken for a longer time as the drop fell off afterwards to discuss only the temperature effect all the interfacial tension measurements that follow were taken after 2 minutes the interfacial tension measurements for salty ethanol canola oil and coal tar water are plotted in fig 3 the reported range of interfacial tensions is generally comprised between 20 50 mn m for tce pce and chlorinated solvents with water at 293 15 k cai and mohanty 1997 dawson and roberts 1997 smith and zhang 2001 yet for both fluid pairs studied we observed low interfacial tensions 3 mn m such low values are found for liquids containing amphiphilic substances this may be the case for the coal tar used in this study as it was a mixture sampled from a real polluted site and its exact chemical composition is unknown commercial oils can also contain additives that reduce the interfacial tension of water oil gaonkar 1989 sanaiotti et al 2010 measured a range of interfacial tensions between soybean oil and water and ethanol mixtures sanaiotti et al 2010 the reported values were between 1 3 mn m which are close to what we measured unknown additives inside the oil might be the cause of these differences previous studies have found that the influence of temperature on interfacial tension is linked to its influence on mutual solubility for binary mixtures composed of a polar and a non polar liquid solubility increases linearly with temperature as a consequence interfacial tension also decreases linearly donahue and bartell 1952 the same trend was found here for coal tar and water as well as for canola oil ethanol in our measurements however the decreasing interfacial tension with temperature for canola oil ethanol was more significant than the decrease for the coal tar water system the linear relationships between interfacial tension and temperatures for both fluid pairs are described by 15 γ c t w t 3 3 3 3 10 3 t 16 γ o e t 5 7 1 2 10 2 t the accuracy of the apparatus was 0 3 mn m which is around 10 of our absolute measurement value fig 4 presents contact angles for coal tar and canola oil droplets against temperature the variations of contact angle are not significant between 283 15 k and 333 15 k and can be considered constant with temperature the slight variations observed on coal tar sessile drops could also be due to repeatability issues with the sessile drop method all materials were cleaned thoroughly between any two measurements and the measurement conditions temperature injection speed and droplet size were precisely respected the measured contact angles between both couples of liquids seem close however coal tar also sticks on solid surfaces while canola oil does not our measurements of contact angle on a glass slide are a first indication of wetting phase conditions they do not reflect the more complex behavior happening with complex liquids like coal tar inside a real porous medium 3 experimental setups and procedures for capillary behavior characterizations the parameters measured in section 2 indicate that temperature has an effect only on the dynamic viscosities of the fluids here we performed the drainage and imbibition experiments for coal tar water and canola oil ethanol in two experimental configurations fig 5 first small pressure variations were applied using a small 1d column to limit viscous fingering and measure capillary pressure saturation curves at 293 15 k and 323 15 k this also avoided interface instability thus we focused on how parameters change with temperature in a generalized darcy s law application case the drainage and imbibition experiments were done using a small transparent 2d cell using the same configuration as before finally the 2d cell was connected to a volumetric pump where flow rate and temperature were varied to observe their effects on saturation and pressure profiles 3 1 experimental setups experiments were carried out inside a 1d vertical column diameter 5 2 cm height 5 6 cm the column fig 5a was made of polyvinylidene fluoride pvdf to resist coal tar corrosion the measurements were made for both fluid pairs coal tar water and canola oil ethanol coal tar was sampled from a field mainly composed of coarse sand with d50 1 mm thus 1 mm homogeneous glass beads were chosen for the experiments this was to avoid inaccuracies due to adsorption effects particle shape heterogeneity pore size distribution and possible wettability changes during data acquisition as shown in fig 5b the drainage imbibition experiments for coal tar water and canola oil ethanol were also performed in a small 2d cell length 5 0 cm height 5 0 cm width 2 0 cm this 2d cell was also made of pvdf to ensure high corrosion resistance against coal tar the cell was made of two transparent glass plates in order to visualize the two phase flow using imaging the container with both fluids was placed on a sartorius cubis mse 0 1 g mass scale acquiring data automatically every 6 s two pressure transducers keller pr33x 300 pa were added to the setup as three way junctions at the top and bottom of the cell the tubing connected to transducers was filled with ethanol initially to avoid the presence of air in the system both transducers were initially calibrated to read 0 10 pa at atmospheric pressure at their respective positions the homogeneity of our beads was checked with sieves with mesh sizes between 0 96 mm and 1 04 mm the mass of glass beads inside the medium was kept constant in order to ensure similar compaction porosity and initial saturation between various experiments the column was filled with glass beads and vibrated slowly during the packing process glass beads were held inside the setup using the stainless steel grids mesh size 0 9 mm initially the wetting phase was injected at 25 ml min with a peristaltic pump inside the porous medium the possible presence of residual air was checked by measuring porosity and permeability experiments were conducted on columns with a porosity between 0 39 and 0 42 the mean permeability of the glass beads was measured to be 3 5 10 10 m2 3 2 quasi static experiment procedure in the quasi static experiment setup the column was connected to two scaled reservoirs 3 5 cm internal diameter and 41 8 cm high details on the experimental setup in quasi static conditions are available in colombano et al 2020 one reservoir was connected to the bottom of the column and filled with the non wetting phase the other reservoir was connected to the top and filled with the wetting phase in this setup the measurements were made by successive equilibrium states the capillary pressure pc is defined as the difference between the pressure of the non wetting phase and that of the wetting phase thus the capillary pressure can be directly defined as the difference of hydrostatic pressures hc between the non wetting and wetting liquids 17 p c p n w p w ρ n w ρ w g h c we chose the initial conditions for the experiments so that the interface between the non wetting and wetting phase would be at equilibrium at the bottom of the 1d column this means that z 0 corresponds to a level of non wetting fluid znw equal to ρ w zw ρ nw for drainage experiments the non wetting reservoir base level was progressively increased by z 0 02 m steps which represents 20 pa and 18 pa variations at 293 15 k and 323 15 k respectively the volume balance between the non wetting phase level znw and wetting phase level zw gave the saturation change between two successive steps this process was repeated until no difference could be observed between the non wetting and wetting reservoir volume variations the levels of non wetting and wetting fluids could be determined with a precision of 1 mm the irreducible wetting saturation sir w was measured as the difference between initial and produced volumes of the wetting phase reservoir during drainage for imbibition experiments the non wetting phase reservoir base level was decreased by 0 02 m steps this time the difference between the initially injected non wetting phase volume and the volume produced during the imbibition gave the residual non wetting saturation sr nw the time step between each height change is an important parameter for achieving the equilibrium condition this time step was kept constant for experimental repeatability to choose this time step we measured the level of the interface inside the 1d cell after a 0 02 m step this level was stationary 3 hours after changing the non wetting phase reservoir for coal tar water and 1 hour for oil ethanol during imbibition we saw slightly low stabilization times during drainages this is mainly due to the influence of gravity drainages are produced upwards imbibitions downwards hence the reservoir level was changed when the saturation in the cell was constant these experimental conditions have been chosen in order to keep a capillary dominant process inside the cell the heights measurements were corrected for the evaporation rate using a reference reservoir to quantify water level change because of evaporation also we limited evaporation by closing the end of the reservoirs with a perforated plastic cap as pointed out before the reservoirs were made with pvdf which is hydrophobic therefore the volume attached to the reservoir wall is not significant and was not considered for hydrostatic pressure measurement for canola oil ethanol and coal tar water two sets of three cell experiments were carried out at 293 15 k and 323 15 k the whole setup was placed in an oven when heated at 323 15 k each set consisted of two successive drainages and imbibitions for the first set of experiments the temperature was kept at 293 15 k for the whole experiment for the second set the primary drainage was performed at 293 15 k but the temperature was increased to 323 15 k from the first imbibition for each experimental case capillary pressure versus saturation datasets were fitted on van genuchten empirical model using a levenberg marquardt algorithm lma written in python 18 s w s i r w 1 s i r w s r n w 1 α h c n 1 1 n we found that this model gave the best least squares residuals out of all tested for our data van genuchten parameters α n and residual saturations have been averaged for each experiment 3 3 dynamic pumping experiment procedure in this case the drainage and imbibition experiments were done only for the oil ethanol system as coal tar was completely opaque and the imaging procedure was not suitable for determining coal tar saturation inside the cell for both drainage and imbibition we used three constant flow rates at room temperature 6 12 24 ml min at 293 15 k in a clockwise motion after injecting 2 pore volumes the pump s direction of rotation was changed to recover the non wetting phase imbibition oil ethanol imbibition was also carried out at 12 ml min at 323 15 k to study the effect of temperature fig 6 presents photographs of the cell during the dynamic experiments the interface between salty ethanol and canola oil observed during drainages was stable for all cases only two pore volumes were needed to reach irreducible ethanol saturation however imbibitions were unstable and prone to viscous fingering ten pore volumes were pumped during imbibition in all cases the pressure difference initially increased because of the ethanol injection until a value of 3800 pa the pressure was read every 6 seconds we observed substantial oscillations on the pressure readings due to the pump s peristaltic motion a digital low pass filter with a cut frequency equal to the cycle frequency of the pump was applied to the data to remove these artefacts the sum of the wetting and non wetting phase outlet masses was measured continuously during the experiment the mass was measured every 6 seconds during both drainage and imbibition 3 4 saturation measurements using imaging saturation was determined inside the 2d small cell with an imaging technique a nikon d810 with nikkor lens 105 nikon digital camera which has a 34 megapixel resolution was used for optical imaging images were acquired every 30 seconds during the injection or pumping of the non wetting phase the experiments were performed in a dark room with two light spots 2 300 w broncolor camera parameters and lighting conditions were identical for all experiments light transmission and light reflection methods have both been used in the past to observe two phase flow processes in porous media geel and sykes 1994 darnault et al 1998 wu et al 2017 in this study the light reflection method lrm was used the main idea of imaging analysis is to determine a relationship between light intensity and wetting phase saturation sw previous work found an exponential relationship between light intensity and saturation gerhard and kueper 2003 colombano et al 2020 the images were in rgb but were transformed in 8 bit images for image analysis the mean gray values were obtained using fiji freeware the following procedure was applied for image analysis of photos from the same experiments adjust or correct lighting differences with the 8 grayscale levels the black and white square correspond to the reflectance of 18 9 and 98 2 respectively as reference values determine the pixel area to be analyzed the pixel area has to be big enough to avoid microscale effects but at the same time not too big to avoid shadows and non uniform lighting the mean gray value averaged over the pixel area was plotted before analyzing images this plot was used to determine an area where the mean gray value was constant use a calibration curve to determine the wetting phase saturation inside the cell for the calibration we took images of cells containing a known volume fraction of glass beads and liquids for each saturation endpoints sw sir w or sw 1 sr nw the cell was uniformly saturated and the reflected light intensity was measured fig b 1 the optical density was defined as the ratio between this measured intensity and the intensity of a white reference 98 2 for oil and ethanol we found a linear relationship sw 2 63 od 2 34 with a coefficient of determination r² close to 1 r² 0 95 this result means ethanol saturation can be determined directly from light intensity measurements this property is useful in order for measuring saturation especially in dynamic conditions for both fluid pairs the relationship between optical density and saturation was measured at 293 15 k and 323 15 k we saw no effect of temperature on the relationship between optical density and saturation 4 results discussion 4 1 effect of temperature on quasi static capillary pressure saturation curves an example of the capillary pressure saturation curves is plotted in fig 7 at 293 15 k for coal tar water the experimental data from all three experiments are presented by crosses exp without distinction however van genuchten parameters were obtained for each experiment separately and then were averaged solid and dashed lines fitted van genuchten parameters irreducible and residual saturations are summarized in table 1 for all experiments this model uses two fitting parameters α m 1 and n which are related to the inverse of the entry pressure and the homogeneity of the porous medium respectively for oil ethanol and coal tar water experiments α values are different this result is coherent because their corresponding measured values of interfacial tension are not the same the parameter n is also much higher for coal tar water than for oil ethanol wetting irreducible and non wetting residual saturations are almost the same when comparing the same case for both fluid pairs following dury et al 1998 we also calculated β coefficients table 1 the ratio between the inverse of α and the interfacial tension for all experiments this ratio is used to scale existing capillary curves to other fluid pairs in our case we found that the values are slightly higher for oil ethanol than coal tar water thus using the scaling procedure it is not possible to get coal tar water capillary pressure saturation curves from oil ethanol ones our results indicate that the scaling laws are not suitable when using complex fluids like coal tar for canola oil ethanol and coal tar water the differences observed in capillary pressure saturation curves between 293 15 k and 323 15 k are within the standard deviation and could not be attributed to temperature effect fig 8 however for coal tar water and the same water saturation values the capillary pressure is lower at 323 15 k than at 293 15 k the previous measurements indicate that temperature changes are almost negligible for density interfacial tension and contact angle between 293 15 k and 323 15 k we showed before that only dynamic viscosity was influenced by temperature changes however the dependency of the dynamic viscosity on temperature did not influence the capillary pressure saturation curves in static conditions the small difference between coal tar water curves at 293 15 k and 323 15 k might be explained by either the heterogeneity of coal tar or alteration of the coal tar water mixture at a higher temperature density dynamic viscosity interfacial tension and contact angle results were used to calculate the relevant dimensionless numbers related to imbibition experiments table 2 bond number bo and viscosity ratio m could be calculated directly with the measured parameters the intrinsic velocity calculated with darcy law was used to calculate ca numbers the pressure difference used in this expression is the same as the one used in our experiments the resulting definition for ca is thus equivalent to the one proposed in chatzis and morrow 1984 since drainage is mostly a stable process due to a favorable viscosity ratio dimensionless numbers will be calculated in the case of imbibition to verify the validity of darcy s law we found the bond number to be slightly below 1 due to the small difference in density between the two phases the flow between coal tar water and oil ethanol in 1 mm glass beads can therefore be described by darcy s law oil ethanol bond number increases with temperature while that of coal tar water decreases this can be explained by the fact that the density difference ρ nw ρ w increases with temperature in the case of oil ethanol but decreases for coal tar water the capillary number has been found to be low enough 10 5 to justify that capillary forces prevail rather than viscous forces at the pore scale in addition no emergence of viscous fingers has been noted during the small pressure step experiments thus we can conclude that measurements of capillary pressure saturation in our case has been done with respect to hypothesis behind generalized darcy s law namely the fact that the interface between both liquid phases is rigid and no fingering occurs it has been found that viscosity ratio during imbibition decreases by a factor 3 for coal tar water and a factor of 2 for oil ethanol here the influence of temperature on the viscosity ratio was not as high as expected those variations were not sufficient to change the order of magnitude of the dimensionless values and to change the residual saturations increasing the temperature has two consequences for the imbibition process increasing the viscosity ratio and decreasing the capillary number also it appears that the effect of temperature on residual non wetting phase saturation sr nw was almost negligible in both cases however previous viscous lnapl and dnapl displacement experiments have shown that the injection of hot water increases the recovery rate of the contaminant and reduces the residual saturation jabbour et al 1996 o carroll and sleep 2007 the experiments are done here by increasing the capillary pressure with small pressure steps several weeks are needed to complete a drainage and imbibition cycle experiment the capillary numbers in our quasi static experiments are still low ca 1 which corresponds to a capillary fingering regime in this case the displacement structure is controlled by the fluctuations in the capillary threshold pressures at the displacement front thus the viscosity ratio does not have a visible effect on the results however for high invasion rates the dependence on m may become relevant because of the viscous dominated displacement in addition the dimensionless numbers between coal tar water and oil ethanol are quite close considering that oil and coal tar are both non wetting fluids the same residual saturations and capillary curves between both fluid pairs should be expected the use of oil ethanol as a model fluid pair is thereby justified 4 2 dynamic effect on two phase flow properties as previously noted two pore volumes pv were needed to reach ethanol irreducible saturation the injection of oil from the bottom drainage into the porous column saturated with ethanol was found to be a stable process at all flow rates during this step only ethanol was produced from the cell outlet and as soon as oil reached the cell outlet only oil was the displacement front was stable due to gravity effects and because oil s dynamic viscosity is higher than ethanol s m 1 we saw a completely different trend for the injection of 10 pv of ethanol from the top of the cell imbibition the following observations were observed for the smallest flow rate 6 ml min the injection of 10 pv of ethanol lasted 38 minutes only oil was recovered during the first 6 minutes 0 to 1 6 pv after that ethanol bubbles started to flow out separately from the system until 10 minutes 1 6 to 2 6 pv then ethanol and oil were both recovered as separate phases at the same time in the tubing oil was flowing near the walls while ethanol was recovered near the center 2 6 to 4 pv finally after pumping for 15 minutes 4 to 10 pv only ethanol was produced for the rest of the injection and the oil saturation did not change these saturation changes during oil injection a and pumping b are shown in fig 9 for different flow rates and temperature values the error bars show the difference between the saturation values calculated from the imaging technique and mass balance for all saturation points the maximum saturation difference between both methods is 0 05 1 ml which validates the proposed imaging technique to determine liquid saturation inside the cell as shown in fig 9a the irreducible saturation sir w has been found not to depend on the flow rate its value varied between 0 03 at 6 ml min and 0 07 at 24 ml min also when the pump was stopped between the injection and pumping steps there was a small time window where a saturation change occurred this effect was even more noticeable for a low flow rate during this time we noticed saturation redistribution inside the cell likely due to end effects there are indeed local saturation gradients inside the cell at pore scale that are more important in dynamic conditions however we do not take it into account because we mostly focused our study on macroscopic characteristics and measure the mean saturation over the whole cell conversely oil pumping heavily depends on both flow rate and temperature fig 9b first higher oil residual saturations were obtained for higher flow rates during the experiments more ethanol fingers swept a lower area at a high flow rate this phenomenon had already been observed and confirmed by doorwar and mohanty 2015 consequently oil saturation decreased at a slower rate even though the pumping rate was higher another important point is that residual saturation was obtained with lower pore volumes for low flow rates almost 8 pv were needed to reach sr o 0 29 at 24 ml min while only 5 pv were needed with sr o 0 06 at 6 ml min the comparison between both profiles at 12 ml min one obtained at 293 15 k and the other 323 15 k shows that temperature had two effects the oil recovery rate was increased at high temperature during our fluid characterization we noted that only the viscosity ratio decreased with temperature thus fewer fingers are formed during the injection of ethanol inside oil at 323 15 k and a higher volume of oil is recovered from the cell in addition the residual saturation is smaller at high temperature 0 06 at 323 15 k vs 0 15 at 293 15 k however as we see before the temperature had no effect on the residual saturation in the quasi static experiments thus from a certain flow rate capillary number where the dynamic effect becomes important the temperature significantly affects the residual saturation finally the results also underline that with increasing temperature which leads to a lower viscosity ratio oil recovery is enhanced at even higher flow rates this means that the remediation time is shortened at higher temperatures the pressure differences between the inlet and outlet of the cell vs saturation curves during oil injection a and pumping b are presented in fig 10 for different flow rates and temperature values as mentioned before we ran the experiments with a volumetric pump this type of pump keeps a constant flow rate and pressure adapts itself in consequence thus a higher injection flow rate leads to a higher pressure difference in the system conversely if the pumping flow rate is high the depression needed will be bigger and can go under atmospheric pressure defined as a relative pressure equal to 0 pa here it is also interesting to note that the pressure required to rotate the pump at 12 ml min was also lower for higher temperature value 323 15 k the cell was at zero oil saturation at the beginning of the oil injection fig 8a the pressure difference inside the cell slowly increased almost linearly until irreducible wetting ethanol saturation the prescribed flow rate at the pump increased the measured pressure difference inside the cell but no difference in saturation values was observed at irreducible ethanol saturation the pressure still increased due to the rise of ethanol level inside the ethanol reservoir situated above the cell the cell was at irreducible wetting saturation at the beginning of the oil pumping fig 8b the pressure difference fell almost immediately as soon as pumping began a higher flow rate translated into a higher initial pressure drop then the pressure difference increased linearly until ethanol breakthrough time at which ethanol starts to be recovered the pressure difference stabilized at non wetting oil residual saturation the pressure needed to pump oil from the cell at 323 15 k was lower than that at 293 15 k this effect is mainly linked to the reduction of dynamic viscosity it is possible to interpret this from another point of view the recovery rate of oil would be higher at 323 15 k than at 293 15 k initially but the pumping done with the highest flow rate 26 ml min is also the pumping that generated the highest residual oil saturation 0 29 a certain balance between operating pressure and temperature needs to be determined for viscous dnapls in permeable media to recover the largest volume from the porous media in the smallest time a summary of all experiments dimensionless numbers irreducible saturations sir w and residual saturations sr o obtained in this work are presented in table 3 for dynamic experiments the characteristic velocity was considered equal to the pump flow rate in m3 s divided by the porous medium section 5 6 cm 2 5 cm for capillary number calculations as seen before for quasi static experiments the bond number can be considered constant this is because the parameters contributing to capillary forces interfacial tension wettability pore geometry are invariant with temperature capillary numbers during dynamic experiments were very high ca 10 2 compared to quasi static ones ca 10 5 viscous forces were much more predominant than capillary forces in that case it should be noted that the reported capillary numbers were obtained in one dimensional flow conditions in a real site the velocity field will change depending on the radial distance from the well studies in 2d and 3d experimental setups are needed to better understand the governing conditions that may impact the dynamic effects in real sites during injection the flow rates tested gave almost zero irreducible saturation the oil was able to sweep almost all the ethanol initially inside the cell the capillary number and mobility ratio were both important to determine the effect of temperature on residual saturation in this case first the flow rate increased ca increased leading to a higher residual saturation due to thinner and longer viscous fingers then the dimensionless numbers were almost the same at 6 ml min at 293 15 k and 12 ml min at 323 15 k thus it is logical to obtain the same residual saturation however it took 10 minutes to reach this value at 323 15 k instead of 40 minutes at 6 ml min at 293 15 k validating the use of temperature as a way to enhance dnapl pumping the generalized darcy s law with the use of relative permeability is often used in order to understand the effect of temperature however in the case of injection or pumping in highly permeable media dynamic effects must be considered and cannot be represented by this law accurately the theoretical notion of relative permeability is compromised due to the presence of viscous fingering and ethanol films around the glass beads in this situation it is difficult to admit the hypothesis that both phases are flowing separately in the medium the fact that temperature reduces oil residual saturation appears to be linked to this also we noted the presence of ethanol films in all experiments under dynamic conditions these films are generally not taken into account in numerical studies considering the effect of temperature their emergence was even higher when the temperature had been increased no experimental study has been conducted on fluid film behavior and it is therefore difficult to highlight if this is an experimental artifact due to the fluids used or a phenomenon that should be taken into account yet when approaching residual saturation values the number of films decreases and becomes even less visible as the capillary number becomes high the presence of these films has been observed in the past in trickle bed reactors reinecke and mewes 1997 the solid particle size used in this type of reactors is in the millimeter range like the ones studied here this leads us to conclude that the presence and retention of these films inside a porous medium are mostly linked to the high capillary number encountered in highly permeable porous media moura et al 2019 have also observed the presence of capillary bridges during drainage experiments their results show that film flow can enhance the recovery of the trapped liquid moura et al 2019 this is coherent with our observations more films are present during imbibition at 323 15 k than at 293 15 k and the resulting ethanol saturation is then reduced pressure difference and ethanol saturation data have been used in order to determine relative permeability curves with the jbn method welge 1952 johnson et al 1959 qin et al 2018 previously measured oil and water relative permeabilities in sand packs and determined that temperature effectively increases both fluids relative permeabilities qin et al 2018 fig 11 represents the effect of temperature on oil and ethanol relative permeability measured in pumping conditions at 12 ml min oil relative permeabilities have been found to have an exponential profile at 293 15 k and an almost linear profile at 323 15 k ethanol relative permeabilities have a small magnitude compared to oil relative permeability due to the high viscosity ratio considered in our study in addition ethanol relative permeability increases with temperature for all saturations oil and ethanol relative permeabilities are higher at 323 15 k rather than at 293 15 k this is due to the difference in saturation profiles between pumping at 293 15 k and 323 15 k both oil and ethanol are thus able to flow at a faster rate in pumping applications for higher temperature 5 conclusion changing soil temperature during dnapl pure phase recovery involves analyses of the parameters used in generalized darcy s law hypotheses behind the use of this equation were recalled and it appears that in soil remediation applications wetting phase film and viscous fingering may appear under dynamic conditions the influence of temperature on a coal tar sampled from a field was investigated density dynamic viscosity interfacial tension and contact angle parameters for coal tar water and oil ethanol a model two phase liquid have been measured between 293 15 k and 323 15 k dynamic viscosities of all studied liquids decrease exponentially with temperature liquids densities and interfacial tensions between the two immiscible coupled fluids decrease linearly with temperature these parameters are all important in the capillary and viscous forces balance determining the flow regime the studies on the expected flow pattern have been investigated by lenormand et al 1988 the further analysis of dimensionless numbers between both fluid pairs showed that it is possible to use oil and ethanol as a model fluid for studying coal tar water two phase flow in porous media we performed drainage and imbibition experiments in a 1d porous cell under almost quasi static ca 10 5 conditions and in the application range of generalized darcy s law during the experiments no viscous fingering was noted nor was a temperature effect observed on two phase flow van genuchten parameters or residual saturations for both couples of liquids at 293 15 k and 323 15 k it should be noted that capillary forces are relatively small in these cases this is because of the highly permeable porous medium used and the low interfacial tension of the considered liquids in all our drainage imbibition experiments the residual saturations and observations obtained with canola oil and ethanol experiments were close to the ones observed with coal tar and water however it is considerably easier to obtain results with simple and almost not toxic liquids like canola oil and ethanol especially by image analyzing techniques this type of simplification is done with glass beads in experiments to model a simpler and inert porous medium with the same permeability and porosity finally we further studied the effect of temperature by pumping oil in the small cell filled by the glass beads at irreducible ethanol saturation and 323 15 k increasing the temperature reduces the pressure difference needed to reach the same pumping rate increases the recovery rate of oil from the porous medium sr o 16 down to 6 when heating from 293 15 k to 323 15 k and finally increases both oil and ethanol relative permeabilities the higher recovery rate is linked not only to reduced viscous fingering but also to the presence of interfacial films that seem to appear because of the high capillary numbers ca 10 2 encountered in highly permeable media residual saturation has also been found to decrease considerably due to decreasing the viscous fingering occurred at low flow rate the presence and growth of viscous fingerings allow the ethanol to flush a larger part of the medium the experiments performed under dynamic conditions have shown that dynamic effects are important when considering temperature effects during pumping operations in complement to our study which focuses on macroscopic quantities it would be interesting to extract local and microscopic quantities to investigate more thoroughly the impact of temperature on two phase flow in a real site the coupling between heat transfers and two phase flow should be also considered in order to better understand the physical mechanisms happening during thermally enhanced dnapl pumping credit authorship

386,using micro ct imaging and differential pressure measurements we design a comparative study in which we simultaneously measure relative permeability and capillary pressure on the same reservoir sandstone sample under water wet and mixed wet conditions during steady state waterflooding experiments this allows us to isolate the impact of wettability on a pore by pore basis and its effect on the macroscopic parameters capillary pressure and relative permeability while keeping the pore space geometry unchanged first oil and brine were injected through a water wet reservoir sandstone sample at a fixed total flow rate but in a sequence of increasing brine fractional flows with micro ct scans of the fluid phases taken in each step then the sample was brought back to initial water saturation and the surface wettability of the sample was altered after prolonged contact with crude oil and the same measurement procedure was repeated on the altered wettability sample which we call mixed wet geometric contact angles were measured which discriminated the water wet and mixed wet cases with average values of 75 and 89 respectively additionally an energy balance was used to determine the effective contact angles for displacement which indicated that a higher advancing contact angle of 116 was needed to displace oil in the mixed wet case for the water wet experiment the filling sequence was pore size dependent with a strong correlation between pore size and oil occupancy however in the mixed wet experiment the principal determinant of the filling sequence was the wettability rather than the pore size and there was no correlation between pore size and the residual oil occupancy the oil water interfacial area had a larger maximum in the mixed wet case which was supported by the observation of sheet or saddle like menisci shapes present throughout the sample volume that impede the flow these shapes were quantified by much larger negative gaussian curvature which indicated better connectivity of the phases consistent with the lower residual oil saturation mean curvature and associated capillary pressure were positive for the water wet case but decreased to a negative value for the mixed wet case pointing to forced displacement from oil wet pores this analysis explained why the relative permeabilities for the mixed wet case were lower than for the water wet case for the same fractional flow keywords micro ct imaging relative permeability capillary pressure curvature wettability alteration pore occupancy 1 introduction multiphase flow in porous media is encountered in many geophysical and industrial applications such as hydrocarbon recovery carbon dioxide sequestration groundwater management and catalyst supports used in the automotive industry bachu 2003 blunt 2017 narula et al 1996 to design these processes an accurate understanding of the physics of flow at the underlying pore scale is of vital importance in particular the important parameters affecting multiphase flow properties are wettability and pore scale geometry the combination of x ray computed microtomography micro ct as an advanced imaging and analysis tool as well as the use of high pressure high temperature coreflooding apparatus provides a myriad of opportunities to develop insights into the fundamentals of multiphase flow in porous media this methodology can provide not only measurements of capillary pressure andrew et al 2014a armstrong et al 2012 and relative permeability alhammadi et al 2020 gao et al 2017 but also simultaneously includes a characterization of pore structure contact angle and curvature locally on a pore by pore basis alratrout et al 2017 andrew et al 2014b berg et al 2013 blunt et al 2013 herring et al 2013 khishvand et al 2017 saif et al 2019 wildenschild and sheppard 2013 more recently it has been used to measure relative permeability and capillary pressure in water wet and mixed wet sandstones and carbonates alhammadi et al 2020 gao et al 2017 y 2019 lin et al 2018 q 2019 zou et al 2018 however hitherto there has not been a comparative study between water wet and altered wettability porous media with the same pore space geometry that systematically relates local to macroscopic wettability descriptors of multiphase flow behaviour wettability plays an important role in controlling the fluid configuration at the pore scale which in turn impacts capillary pressure and relative permeability anderson 1987a b avraam and payatakes 1995 1999 blunt 2017 hirasaki 1991 since hydrocarbon reservoirs have been saturated with crude oil over geologic times they are typically under altered wettability conditions due to the deposition of surface active components of the oil asphaltenes on the solid surface of the rock buckley et al 1998 kovscek et al 1993 salathiel 1973 this wettability alteration changes the contact angle the angle oil and water interface forms with the solid surface image based measurements of contact angle inside the rock have shown that wettability cannot be described by a single contact angle alhammadi et al 2017 alratrout et al 2017 the wettability of the surface depends on the fluids the surface itself and the local pore geometry and roughness this can result in a range of contact angle both above and below 90 mixed wet conditions which can enable the simultaneous flow of oil and water over a wide range of saturations alratrout et al 2018 while the geometric contact angle which directly measures this angle inside the rock from an image can be used to characterise wettability it does not necessarily describe the contact angle during fluid displacement akai et al 2019 this is because the fluid solid contacts are often pinned with a hinging angle the contact only moves in a displacement when a sufficiently high advancing angle is reached that allows the water to progress across an oil wet surface kovscek et al 1993 the use of energy balance has provided athermodynamic contact angle that captures the wettability consistent with the displacement observed akai et al 2020 blunt et al 2019 in this work we will test both geometric and energy balance approaches to understand wettability zou et al 2018 measured relative permeability in a mixed wet bentheimer sandstone with the wettability altered by an organic chemical octadecyltrichlorosilane ots and compared these results with data obtained from the same sample under water wet conditions lin et al 2019 measured relative permeability and capillary pressure in mixed wet bentheimer and compared these to a water wet case both these studies have found that the oil relative permeability was lower in the mixed wet case before the crossover point the saturation where the two relative permeabilities are equal while the brine relative permeability was higher at the residual oil saturation the low residual oil saturation observed in mixed wet media implies that both oil and water remain connected through the pore space over a wide saturation range alhammadi et al 2017 2020 lin et al 2019 topologically this is linked to the presence of saddle shaped interfaces between oil and water with the two principal curvatures of different sign in orthogonal directions khanamiri et al 2018 this results in a low capillary pressure but high connectivity of both oil and brine alhammadi et al 2020 explored the relative permeability capillary pressure and oil recovery in a mixed wet microporous carbonate and observed saddle shaped interfaces which helped explain the favourable oil recovery obtained moreover the recovery was facilitated by water flowing through micro porosity over a wide range of saturation which was manifested through the low water relative permeability in a modelling study bakhshian et al 2019 analysed the effect of wettability heterogeneity on a co2 brine system in a sandstone using the lattice boltzmann method and found that when the percentage of co2 wet regions increases at a given saturation for the drainage cycle the brine relative permeability is higher the co2 relative permeability is lower and the capillary pressure is lower furthermore using the same method and for the same co2 brine system bakhshian et al 2020 studied the interaction between wettability and heterogeneity for a wide range of contact angle 25 θ 175 and concluded that the both wettability and heterogeneity play an important role determining recovery these previous studies comparing water wet and mixed wet conditions were either performed on different samples or on the same sample but with wettability altered by a chemical instead of crude oil to accurately assess and understand how crude oil alters wettability and how the wettability impacts fluid configurations and flow properties it is necessary to perform both experiments on the same rock sample and use crude oil to mimic realistic reservoir conditions in this paper we study oil and brine configurations in the pore space of the same reservoir sandstone sample under water wet and mixed wet conditions over a range of fractional flows we use x ray imaging combined with pressure measurements to quantify the impact that wettability alteration on a pore by pore basis exerts on pore and throat fluid occupancy and to relate these observations to the measured relative permeability and capillary pressure our goal is to quantify i geometric and thermodynamic contact angles ii oil and brine pore occupancy and pore filling sequence iii interfacial area iv mean curvature v gaussian curvature vi capillary pressure and vii relative permeability using this rich range of multi phase flow descriptors we will accurately discriminate different wettability behaviour at the local pore and macroscopic core scales 2 materials and methods 2 1 rock samples and fluid properties a cylindrical sample of a reservoir sandstone 6 mm in diameter with a length of 32 mm was used in this study as shown in fig 1 the porosity estimated from the micro ct image was 0 184 0 009 in which micro porosity accounted for 0 022 0 003 the micro porosity was measured using differential imaging and will be characterised in section 2 3 2 the helium porosity measured from a cm scale sample from which this smaller sample was drilled was 0 206 based on darcy s law the absolute permeability was calculated by measuring the pressure differential under single phase brine flow to be 9 56 0 06 10 13 m2 the absolute permeability measured using the same method on the cm sized rock from which our sample was taken was 9 8 10 13 m2 the agreement for absolute permeability and porosity between the mm and cm sized samples indicates that the rock is reasonably homogeneous at the mm scale and that our results are likely to be representative of a larger body of rock the oil phase was decalin with a dynamic viscosity of 2 96 0 08 mpa s at 20 c provided by alfa aesar the aqueous brine phase was water doped with 3 5 wt potassium iodide ki which was used as a high contrast dopant to distinguish the brine phase with the other two phases oil and grain the viscosity of the brine was 0 93 0 05 mpa s measured by rheometer mcr301 anton paar and the interfacial tension between oil and water was measured as 51 5 1 6 mn m by the pendant drop method using a rame hart apparatus 590 f4 series at ambient conditions andreas et al 1938 stauffer 1965 the crude oil used for ageing was from the oil field from which the sandstone sample was taken the molecular weight was 229 3 the density and viscosity at 70 c was 864 6 kg m3 and 12 71 mpaˑs respectively the composition of the crude oil was 51 wt saturates 33 6 wt aromatics and 15 4 wt polar measured by total 2 2 experimental methods this study consisted of three main experiments a a steady state flow experiment performed on a water wet sample in which the total flow rate was 0 02 ml min b wettability alteration at high temperature and high pressure on the same sample and c a steady state flow experiment performed on the same sample now with altered wettability in which the total flow rate was again 0 02 ml min the dual injection flow apparatus used in this study is shown in fig 2 the experimental flow apparatus showing the three main components core holder differential pressure transducer and four syringe pumps to apply a constant flow rate as well as confining and back pressure the sample was placed in a fluoro polymer elastomer viton sleeve in the carbon fibre hassler type flow cell fluid flow lines were used to connect the core holder with the pumps brine and oil were injected into the sample through two separate ports to ensure that two fluids flowed into the sample simultaneously for the steady state flow experiments the total flow rate was 0 02 ml min while varying the fractional flow defined as the volumetric flow rate of water brine to the total flow rate brine plus oil the capillary number was 6 6 10 7 based on the definition ca μq σ where μ is the average viscosity of the injected fluids q is the total darcy velocity and σ is the interfacial tension between the two phases this capillary number was chosen to ensure that fixed and stable brine and oil pathways could be observed as shown in our previous work in bentheimer sandstone gao et al 2017 gao et al 2020 the experiments were performed by following the steps 1 the rock sample was put in the viton sleeve in the core holder fluid flow lines were used to connect the pumps and core holder inside the micro ct scanner 2 confining pressure was applied by injecting deionized water into the empty annulus space between the carbon fibre sleeve and the viton sleeve 2 mpa was set for confining pressure to avoid any bypass flow between the sample and the sleeve 3 four continuous images were taken for the whole sample with a voxel size of 6 µm the overlap between one scan to the next was approximately 25 this overlap was used to stitch the two scans together two scans were taken over part of the sample with the voxel size of 3 58 µm the scan position is shown in fig 1 the overlap between these two scans was about 25 as well 4 carbon dioxide was injected for 30 min to replace the air in the sample 5 at least 200 pore volumes pv 30 wt brine was injected into the rock sample to ensure that it was 100 saturated with brine this step was used to measure the sub resolution pore space as the contrast between 30 wt brine and grain was sufficient to observe the change in x ray absorption in micro porosity compared to the dry air saturated scan lin et al 2016 gao et al 2019 alhammadi et al 2020 this will be introduced in detail in section 2 3 2 6 the pressure differential between the inlet and outlet of the sample was measured over two flow rates which was used to calculate the absolute permeability a back pressure of 2 mpa was set for the flow system the confining pressure was set at 4 mpa 7 four brine scans were taken for the whole sample when the voxel size was 6 µm and two more were taken when voxel size was 3 58 µm at the same positions as the dry scans 8 at least 1000 pv 3 5 wt brine was flooded to remove the high salinity brine in the sample 9 at least 110 pv oil was injected from 0 02 ml min to 2 ml min to reach a uniform initial water saturation this is a primary drainage process 10 oil was injected continually at a flow rate of 0 02 ml min when the brine fractional flow was 0 when steady state was identified the measured pressure drop was constant for more than 2 h the scans were taken at the same position as mentioned in step 3 it took approximately 24 h to reach steady state in this experiment 11 step 10 was repeated for fractional flows of fw 0 05 0 15 0 3 0 5 0 7 and 0 95 with a total flow rate of 0 02 ml min the oil flow rate was decreased from 0 019 ml min to 0 001 ml min and the brine flow rate was increased from 0 001 ml min to 0 019 ml min six scans were taken at each fractional flow at steady state at the same position as described in step 3 the pressure differential was recorded throughout the whole experiment 12 at least 110 pv brine was injected from 0 02 ml min to 2 ml min step by step to reach the residual oil saturation then brine injection continued at 0 02 ml min to measure the pressure differential when the fractional flow was 1 six scans were taken at the same position as described in step 3 13 the sample was taken out of the core holder and the pressure differences along the tubing were measured by repeating steps 10 to 12 but without the rock present 14 the brine in the sample was replaced by deionized water and dried in an oven for one week both water and remaining oil in the sample evaporated and left the sample clean and dry then the sample was put into the core holder and then moved into the oven the oven temperature was 80 1 c 15 steps 1 2 4 and 8 were repeated the pore pressure and confining pressure were set to 10 mpa and 12 mpa respectively the sandstone was kept at these conditions for 3 days to allow for ion equilibration occurring between the grains and brine 16 at least 100 pv of heated crude oil about 80 c were injected into the sample from 0 02 ml min to 2 ml min the sandstone sample was kept at these conditions for two weeks then the flow direction was reversed and 100 more pv of crude oil were injected by increasing the flow rate from 0 02 ml min to 2 ml min this was done to obtain a uniform initial brine saturation resulting in a homogeneous wettability alteration the sample was then exposed to the same conditions for three more weeks this whole process is called ageing and is used to alter the wettability of the sample which mimics the reservoir conditions in the subsurface 17 the pore pressure was decreased to 2 mpa and the confining pressure was decreased to 4 mpa the core holder was then isolated by closing the valves connected to the tubing then the core holder was moved into the micro ct scan with the apparatus as shown in fig 2 the pid controller was connected to the core holder and the temperature was set at 70 c to allow the crude oil to flow 18 decalin was injected into the sample to displace the crude oil inside the sample until no crude oil was produced then the temperature was set back to ambient conditions 19 steps 9 to 12 were repeated on the mixed wet sample oil and brine were co injected at eight brine fractional flows f w 0 0 05 0 15 0 3 0 5 0 7 0 95 and 1 at a fixed flow rate of 0 02 ml min and images were taken at the same position as described in step 3 again the pressure differential was recorded throughout the experiment 2 3 imaging methods and processing 2 3 1 imaging method the images were taken by a zeiss xrm 510 x ray microscope using a flat panel detector the x ray energy was 75 kev and the power was 6 5 w the number of projections for each image was 2200 to enhance image quality all tomograms were reconstructed into three dimensional images using the zeiss reconstructor software at each fractional flow the four images with 6 35 µm voxel size were normalized to the brine saturated images as a reference and stitched together to obtain an image of the whole sample as shown on the left in fig 1 the stitched image size was 1000 1000 5340 voxels which measured 6 6 32 mm3 similarly each pair of overlapping images with voxel size of 3 58 µm were normalized to the brine images and then stitched together as shown on the right in fig 1 the stitched image size was 1608 1608 2933 voxels or 6 6 10 5 mm3 all images were registered to the brine images to have the same orientation and the lanczos algorithm was used to resample the images burger and burge 2016 a non local means filter was used to remove noise and smooth the images while preserving edges buades et al 2005 2008 2 3 2 characterization of the pore space differential imaging was used to quantify both the resolvable and the sub resolution pore space 30 wt ki brine increased the contrast between brine and grain and emphasized the sub resolution pore space lin et al 2016 this was analysed from the 6 6 10 5 mm3 sample with a voxel size of 3 58 µm fig 3 a shows a two dimensional slice of the dry scan while fig 3 b shows the same slice of the fully brine saturated image we clearly observe some sub resolution pores with intermediate grey scales in both images indicated by the yellow boxes to quantify the porosity of the sub resolution pore space the differential image between fig 3 b and a is obtained as shown in fig 3 c figs 4 and 5 confirmed that oil did not enter these micro porous regions during the steady state experiments proving that the capillary entry pressure was not sufficiently high for the oil to displace brine from these regions fig 3 d shows the segmented macro pore space table 1 lists the volume fraction of solid grain micro pore space macro pore space and the corresponding porosity the porosity of sub resolution pores is 0 56 0 01 and its contribution to the total porosity is 0 022 0 003 where the total porosity is 0 184 0 009 more details of this method can be found in lin et al 2016 and gao et al 2019 2 3 3 characterization of fluids in the pore space grey scale images for each fractional flow with the voxel size of 3 58 µm from the water wet experiment are illustrated in fig 4 while those from the mixed wet experiment are shown in fig 5 the black is oil the dark grey is grains and the light grey is brine the watershed method was applied to segment the images to oil and water phases beucher and meyer 1993 to quantify oil and brine saturation accurately the images were cropped into cylindrical sections to avoid the sleeve shown at the boundary of the core for the macro pore space the fluids were segmented into brine blue and oil red as shown in fig 6 water wet and fig 7 mixed wet a description of the measurements used for this paper which includes the image size and voxel size are listed in table 2 3 results and discussion we start with wettability characterization by quantifying the geometric and thermodynamic contact angles for the two sets of experiments in section 3 1 then we present fluid occupancy in pores and throats in section 3 2 this is followed by an analysis of interfacial area in section 3 3 in section 3 4 we present interfacial curvature including mean curvature and gaussian curvature then the calculation of capillary pressure from the mean curvature isdescribed in section 3 5 followed by the determination of relative permeability in section 3 6 3 1 wettability characterization fig 8 a shows the configuration of oil and water in a selected region of the pore space under water wet and mixed wet conditions as an example black is oil and light grey is water oil resided in large pores under water wet conditions while it occupied some small pores and corners for the mixed wet case in situ contact angle can be measured from x ray images alhammadi et al 2017 andrew et al 2014b and an automated method has been developed to quantify the distribution of contact angle alratrout et al 2017 we call this the geometric contact angle this automated method identifies the fluid fluid and fluid solid interfaces in the segmented images these interfaces are then smoothed and the three phase contact line where the fluid fluid interface contacts the solid is identified at every voxel in the image on the contact line the two vectors that have a direction which is perpendicular to both surfaces fluid solid and fluid fluid is identified then contact angle values at all recognized oil brine solid contacts can be generated from the dot product of these vectors we used this automated method to measure the distribution of contact angle when the fractional flow was 0 5 shown in fig 8 b the average contact angle was 74 9 and 88 8 for water wet and mixed wet conditions respectively the geometric contact angle for all fractional flows under both conditions are listed in table 3 we can see that there is a wider range of contact angles for mixed wet case with values both above and below 90 the wide range of measured contact angles reflects complex structure of the rough surfaces in the pore space alratrout et al 2018 because the geometric contact angle was measured directly at the three phase contact line from the images this process is particularly sensitive to the image quality and segmentation which introduces uncertainties furthermore because some interfaces between oil and brine may be pinned at the contact line before a higher angle for brine to advance over an altered wettability surface is reached morrow 1970 the measured contact angles may not properly represent the values during a displacement to provide the wettability for a displacement process directly the thermodynamic contact angle considering changes in saturation and interfacial areas between each phase are calculated from an energy balance assuming negligible viscous dissipation blunt et al 2019 1 δ a w s c o s θ t 2 κ ϕ δ s w δ a o w where δaws is the change in the specific interfacial area between water brine and solid θ t is the thermodynamic contact angle κ is the mean curvature ϕ is the porosity δsw is the change in the water brine saturation and δaow is the change in the specific interfacial area between oil and water brine the specific interfacial area here is defined as the surface area per unit volume fig 8 c shows the thermodynamic contact angles calculated for water wet and mixed wet conditions the differences in eq 1 are found from two subsequent fractional flows and the contact angle is shown as a function of the lower fractional flow used in the calculation up to s w 0 3 the contact angle increases to 100 in the mixed wet case and to 80 in the water wet case with further water injection the thermodynamic contact angle increases to 116 in the mixed wet case while it slightly decreases to 65 in the water wet experiment a higher advancing contact angle is needed to displace oil in the mixed wet case as expected brine first fills the more water wet pores and then later less water wet pores more details on how interfacial area changes are provided in section 3 3 and how the water saturation changes in section 3 6 3 2 fluid occupancy in pores and throats we now test how wettability impacts pore and throat occupancy from the segmented images previously shown in figs 6 and 7 the location and size of the pores and or throats occupied by oil and brine are investigated based on the radii of spheres inscribed in the pore space the void space was subdivided into pores representing wider regions and throats representing narrow connections between the pores using a generalized pore network extraction algorithm raeini et al 2017 each voxel is assigned to a unique pore as well as to a unique throat the voxels which are located at local maxima of the distance map the distance of any point in the void space to the nearest solid are assigned as the centres of pore or throat then the volume weighted fraction of pores and throats whose centres were occupied by brine or oil were computed to analyse the statistics of the pore and throat fluid occupancy figs 9 and 10 show the results for different fractional flows for the water wet and mixed wet experiments respectively for both cases the initial water saturation was very low oil resided in almost all the pores and throats consistent with the pore filling sequence for a water wet medium as shown in fig 9 when the fractional flow increased we can see that brine initially filled the smaller elements and then filled progressively larger pores and throats oil always occupied the larger pores and throats when fw increased from 0 05 to 0 7 brine mainly filled in more small pores and the corners of larger pores more brine occupied pores of intermediate size when fw 0 7 for comparison fig 10 illustrates a different pore throat filling sequence in the mixed wet case during the waterflooding process there is no preference for the water to fill either large or small pores this shows that local contact angle rather than pore size is the principal determinant of the filling sequence there is however a tendency for the smaller throats to fill first which indicates that the narrowest restrictions in the pore space remain largely water wet after ageing overall more oil was displaced compared to the water wet case showing that mixed wet conditions give a lower residual oil saturation alhammadi et al 2017 jadhunandan and morrow 1995 to quantify the correlation between the radius of pore space oil occupancy and filling order we calculate the pearson correlation coefficient benesty et al 2009 for the water wet and mixed wet samples the pearson correlation coefficients between oil occupancy at pore and throat centres which is either 1 or 0 and their inscribed radii for each fractional flow are shown in fig 11 the correlation coefficient is computed with pore and throat volumes as weighting factors 2 c c c o v r a σ r σ a where c o v r a i v i a i a r i r i v i is the covariance between radius r and oil occupancy ɑ and σ x c o v x x is the standard deviation v is pore or throat volume and the summation is performed over all pores and throats subscript i for the water wet sample the correlation coefficient initially increases with s w and is approximately 0 6 when s w 0 4 however for the mixed wet experiment the correlation coefficient decreases when s w increases the correlation between pore and throat radius and oil occupancy at the end of water injection is 0 54 in the water wet case while it is 0 06 for the mixed wet data we can conclude that there is a reasonably strong correlation between pore and throat radius and occupancy by oil for the water wet sample but essentially no correlation in the mixed wet case this proves that for the water wet case oil is first pushed out of small pores and then out of some large pores as well in the altered wettability case both small and large pores tend to be filled at low water fractional flows but overall more oil is displaced from large pores than out of smaller pores and hence the correlation coefficients move toward zero and negative values as the fractional flow is increased 3 3 interfacial area fig 12 a shows the oil brine interfaces at f w 0 5 for an image of size 560 560 560 voxels with a voxel size of 3 58 µm as an example the interfaces between oil and brine were extracted and smoothed using a volume preserving gaussian smoothing to remove voxelization artefacts taubin 1995 we can see that the interfaces are quasi spherical in the water wet case while the arrangement of the interfaces is more complex for the mixed wet experiment we observe saddle shaped interfaces with opposite curvatures in orthogonal directions this will be discussed in more detail in section 3 4 the measured specific interfacial area which is the interfacial area per unit volume between oil brine brine solid and oil solid is shown in fig 12 b for both cases the interfacial area between oil and solid was highest at the beginning of the waterflood when oil occupied almost all the pore space for the water wet case at higher water saturations brine starts to fill small pores and the corners of large pores and the water solid interfacial area increased approximately linearly with water saturation while the oil solid interfacial area decreased correspondingly the oil brine interfacial area increased first and reached a maximum at fw 0 7 then decreased at higher fractional flow the menisci between oil and brine contributing to the area principally block pores and throats and add to the resistance to flow at higher fractional flows the oil brine area decreases as there are fewer menisci although it remains high as oil is trapped in the larger pore spaces surrounded by brine for the mixed wet case the oil solid interfacial area initially decreases rapidly which represents the displacement of oil from some of the larger pores the final area at the end of waterflooding is lower than in the water wet case since the remaining oil saturation is lower the oil brine interfacial area increased initially with fractional flow and reached a maximum at fw 0 5 then decreased the maximum oil water interfacial area was approximately 50 larger in the mixed wet case which is consistent with the visualizations in fig 12 a showing sheet or saddle like menisci spanning the sample 3 4 curvature analysis the gaussian curvature is defined as k κ 1 κ 2 berger and gostiaux 2012 gauss and pesic 2005 where κ1 and κ2 are the two principal curvatures and we define κ 1 κ 2 the mean curvature is κ κ 1 κ 2 2 both mean and gaussian curvatures were analysed on the same sub volume considered for interfacial area in the previous section the mean curvature was measured on the connected oil phase and brine clusters of volume greater than 0 01 mm3 in the water wet case the curvature values larger than 0 2 μm 1 or smaller than 0 2 μm 1 were considered as outliers caused by segmentation artefacts and were excluded from the analysis alhammadi et al 2020 lin et al 2018 2019 in the mixed wet case curvature values larger than 0 25 μm 1 or smaller than 0 25 μm 1 were excluded fig 13 illustrates the mean curvature distribution at fw 0 5 for both cases where we identify three possibilities κ 1 0 κ 2 0 κ 1 κ 2 0 and κ 1 0 κ 2 0 the mean curvature distribution includes measurements for both connected and disconnected oil brine interfaces in the water wet case most interfaces have two positive principal curvatures although in many cases one curvature is positive and the other negative this represents arc menisci in the corners of the pore space andrew et al 2014a the percentage of the principal curvature groups defining different gaussian curvatures that have both positive both negative and one positive one negative principal curvatures is 58 8 0 2 and 41 0 respectively the interfaces with one positive curvature and the other negative are important to maintain connectivity of the oil as discussed later there are almost no interfaces with two negative principal curvatures indicating that water is well connected in the mixed wet experiment there are more negative curvatures than positive curvatures and most of the curvatures have one positive and one negative value giving a negative gaussian curvature the percentage of the principal curvature groups that have both positive both negative and one positive one negative principal curvatures is 3 9 32 8 and 63 3 respectively as we show later this has implications for oil connectivity there are more interfaces that have two negative principal curvatures than the ones that have two positive curvatures this implies poor water connectivity but better oil connectivity signifying a lower residual oil saturation fig 14 a shows the distributions of the two principal curvatures κ 1 and κ 2 for the water wet experiment at f w 0 5 and for the mixed wet experiment at f w 0 05 and f w 0 5 fig 14 b shows the corresponding gaussian curvatures for the connected oil phase both κ 1 and κ 2 distributions are more negative in the mixed wet case for the water wet case at f w 0 5 κ 1 is always positive while κ 2 has both negative and positive values for the mixed wet case both κ 1 and κ 2 shift towards more negative values from the f w 0 05 to f w 0 5 this difference in principal curvatures for f w 0 05 and f w 0 5 is sufficiently large that as we will show in section 3 5 for the former this results in a positive mean curvature and hence positive capillary pressure while for the latter capillary pressure is negative moreover the distributions are wider in the mixed wet case implying more negative gaussian curvatures leading to simultaneous flow of oil and brine as shown in fig 14 b fig 15 shows the mean curvature for all eight fractional flows here we consider the connected oil phase only which contributed to the flow in the beginning of waterflooding as brine preferentially filled more water wet regions of the pore space the shape of oil brine menisci was almost spherical with a positive mean curvature for the water wet case the mean curvatures for all fractional flows remained positive consistent with previous experiments on water wet bentheimer sandstone lin et al 2018 however in the mixed wet case for fw 0 3 invasion principally filled oil wet regions where the thermodynamic contact angle for displacement was greater than 90 see fig 8 c as a result the mean curvatures were negative again as seen in a mixed wet bentheimer lin et al 2019 and an aged reservoir carbonate alhammadi et al 2020 fig 16 demonstrates the average gaussian curvature for the eight fractional flows by considering all the interfaces between oil and brine as mentioned at the start of this section gaussian curvature is the product of the two principal curvatures in orthogonal directions the gauss bonnet theorem provides a relationship between the topology of the oil clusters and the integral of the gaussian curvature across the bounding surface allendoerfer and weil 1943 armstrong et al 2019 blunt et al 2020 the more negative the value of this integral the better connected the object considered here connectivity refers to the number of redundant loops in the structure in our context for a negative gaussian curvature when water invades oil occupied pores and throats the oil remains connected since filling does not disconnect the oil clusters in both cases the gaussian curvatures are negative with a similar magnitude when fw 1 which shows that the oil connectivity remains high even when more brine was injected into the sample the absolute value of average gaussian curvature obtained from the mixed wet case was larger than that obtained from water wet case implying that the oil connectivity was better in mixed wet case as the oil can remain in layers even in water occupied pores and throats which is consistent with a lower residual oil saturation at fw 1 the end point the oil is disconnected and hence trapped and in both cases the gaussian curvature therefore is as expected positive as fig 17 a shows the volume of trapped oil ganglia under water wet conditions was larger than that under mixed wet conditions and this is supported by the ganglia size distribution analysis shown in fig 17 b in the water wet case we see fewer small trapped clusters and more larger clusters as opposed to the mixed wet system where the remaining oil resides in smaller pores and as layers 3 5 capillary pressure capillary pressure is defined as the pressure difference between the oil and brine phases pc po pw the local capillary pressure has been calculated from mean interfacial curvature from pore scale images section 3 4 using the young laplace law 3 p c 2 σ κ the capillary pressure calculated from eq 3 using the mean curvature shown in fig 15 is illustrated in fig 18 the uncertainties in saturation are estimated from likely uncertainties in the image segmentation the uncertainties in capillary pressure are calculated from the variations in the mean interfacial curvature for the water wet case the capillary pressure is positive and gradually decreases with saturation here oil is displaced from water wet pores by spontaneous imbibition for the mixed wet case capillary pressure becomes negative signifying water injection for which water needs to be forced into more oil wet pores resulting in additional recovery the primary drainage capillary pressure was measured on a separate sample taken from the same larger block of sandstone as the one used in these experiments 3 6 relative permeability darcy s law was used to calculate the relative permeabilities for the sample under water wet and mixed wet conditions the brine saturation at each fractional flow was measured from the images of the whole sample see fig 1 the brine saturation profiles measured across the whole sample for all fractional flows are shown in fig 19 this accounts for both brine in the macro pores explicitly resolvable in the segmented images and brine in micro porosity see section 2 3 2 fig 19 a1 and b1 shows the brine saturation profiles averaged in slices perpendicular to the flow direction for all the eight fractional flows over the length of the whole image taken with a voxel size of 6 35 µm under water wet and mixed wet conditions respectively for comparison fig 19 a2 and b2 shows the brine saturation profiles over the part of the sample scanned with the voxel size of 3 58 µm under water wet and mixed wet conditions respectively since there is no discernible saturation gradient we do not correct for the capillary pressure gradients caused by capillary end effect lin et al 2019 which is not unexpected in systems with low capillary pressure the pressure differentials across the sample at steady state were recorded by a precise differential transducer pd 33x keller with a range of 500 kpa and the accuracy was 0 05 of the whole range table 4 presents the pressure differential and its standard deviation for both water wet and mixed wet experiments the relative permeabilities were calculated by 4 k r w q w μ w l δ p k k r o q o μ o l δ p k where kr is the relative permeability of each phase q is the darcy velocity of each phase μ is the viscosity l is the length of the whole sample δp is the pressure differential along the sample and k is the absolute permeability the subscript w represents the brine water phase and o represents the oil table 4 presents the brine water saturation and the relative permeabilities at each fractional flow for these two experiments fig 20 shows the measured relative permeabilities for the same sample under water wet and mixed wet conditions error bars in the x direction consider uncertainties caused by segmentation error bars in the y direction consider uncertainties caused by the measurement of the length and diameter pressure measurement and the pump rates in the water wet case the initial water saturation was 0 20 in the mixed wet case the initial water saturation was 0 17 in both cases the initial water principally resides in sub resolution micro porosity see section 2 3 2 initially f w 0 kro is slightly higher in the mixed wet case however during displacement at the same fractional flow between 0 15 and 0 95 both water and oil relative permeabilities in the mixed wet case are lower than those in water wet case menisci spanning the pore space impede the flow of the fluids the lower relative permeabilities in the mixed wet case are consistent with the larger oil brine interfacial areas measured see fig 12 while in the mixed wet case brine occupies some of the larger pores fig 10 these pores do not connect across the pore space until a high brine saturation is reached which keeps the water relative permeability low the oil relative permeability is also low as the oil now is confined to smaller pores these results are consistent with previous measurements on a mixed wet bentheimer sandstone lin et al 2019 and a reservoir carbonate alhammadi et al 2020 at the end point f w 1 krw in the mixed wet case with a residual oil saturation of 0 18 is higher than that in water wet case which has a higher residual oil saturation of 0 26 this is consistent with the connectivity analysis based on gaussian curvature fig 16 that indicates that the oil is better connected in the mixed wet case the water tends to occupy some of the larger pores particularly near the end point as seen in fig 10 which explains the higher end point water relative permeability compared to the water wet experiment where water only resides in the smaller pores see fig 9 our results are compared with the experimental results obtained from bentheimer sandstone under water wet conditions by gao et al 2017 and lin et al 2018 2019 under both water wet and mixed wet conditions bentheimer has a similar pore structure porosity and permeability to the reservoir sample here although it contains a negligible amount of micro porosity these results show similar trends for both the water wet and mixed wet cases there is however one crucial difference in bentheimer the cross over saturation where the two relative permeabilities are equal in the mixed wet case was higher implying in mainly cases a more favourable waterflood oil recovery blunt 2017 in our experiments the water saturation of the cross over point is similar under both conditions this cross over is governed by a subtle balance of pore occupancy and connectivity controlled by pore structure and wettability in bentheimer the water filled some larger pores under mixed wet conditions but these pores remained poorly connected in our experimentsexperiments we observe the same phenomenon but the water relative permeability rises slightly more rapidly this is likely due to increases in connectivity and conductivity mediated by the small amount of water filled micro porosity which is absent in bentheimer 4 conclusions to assess the impact of wettability on two phase flow signatures in porous media we combined micro ct imaging with a waterflood experiment and conducted steady state measurements on one reservoir sandstone sample under both water wet and mixed wet conditions the comparison of wettability pore occupancy interfacial area mean curvature gaussian curvature capillary pressure and relative permeability in the same rock sample allows us to obtain a rich understanding of the two phase displacement mechanisms and changes in pore occupancy caused by wettability alteration 1 the measured average of geometric contact angles was within the range of 74 76 under water wet conditions while it was 88 91 for mixed wet conditions the thermodynamic contact angle computed for displacement using energy balance was approximately 65 in the water wet case but 116 in the mixed wet sample at the end of the displacement 2 brine mainly filled small pores and throats and the corners of larger pores and oil occupied the large pores for the water wet case while pores of all size were filled during waterflooding in the mixed wet case 3 for both water wet and mixed wet experiments with an increase in water fractional flow the oil brine interfacial area increased reached a maximum value and then decreased the oil brine interfacial area was 50 larger in the mixed wet case implying greater blocking of the pore space by menisci 4 the mean curvatures for the connected oil phase were positive in the water wet case while they were positive at the start of waterflooding and then became negative for fractional flows f w 0 15 in the mixed wet experiment as more oil wet regions of the pore space were invaded 5 the average gaussian curvatures defined as the product of the two principal curvatures was negative during the displacement implying connected phases the gaussian curvature was lower more negative in the mixed wet case which explains the better connectivity of the oil phase and the lower residual oil saturation 6 capillary pressure was calculated from the mean interfacial curvature for the water wet case capillary pressures were positive and decreased slowly with an increase of f w for the mixed wet case capillary pressures were positive at the start and became negative when f w 0 15 7 relative permeabilities were calculated from the pressure differential measured during the experiment and the saturation calculated based on the images consistent with the analysis of pore occupancy and interfacial area the relative permeabilities for the mixed wet case were lower for the same fractional flow the water relative permeability in the mixed wet case remained low at intermediate saturation since the water even if it resided in some of the larger pores did not have connected pathways of wide pores through the pore space at a higher water saturation the water relative permeability rose to a higher value than in the water wet case where the water was always confined to the smaller pores and throats the oil relative permeability in the mixed wet case was low since now oil occupied some of the smaller pores and throats with low conductance this imaging experimental and analysis approach provides rich data sets to understand two phase flow through porous media the results can be used to benchmark and validate pore scale models in the future this method can be further applied in more heterogeneous rocks and mixed wet systems furthermore this method can be applied to study various other porous medium problems including fuel cells water and

386,using micro ct imaging and differential pressure measurements we design a comparative study in which we simultaneously measure relative permeability and capillary pressure on the same reservoir sandstone sample under water wet and mixed wet conditions during steady state waterflooding experiments this allows us to isolate the impact of wettability on a pore by pore basis and its effect on the macroscopic parameters capillary pressure and relative permeability while keeping the pore space geometry unchanged first oil and brine were injected through a water wet reservoir sandstone sample at a fixed total flow rate but in a sequence of increasing brine fractional flows with micro ct scans of the fluid phases taken in each step then the sample was brought back to initial water saturation and the surface wettability of the sample was altered after prolonged contact with crude oil and the same measurement procedure was repeated on the altered wettability sample which we call mixed wet geometric contact angles were measured which discriminated the water wet and mixed wet cases with average values of 75 and 89 respectively additionally an energy balance was used to determine the effective contact angles for displacement which indicated that a higher advancing contact angle of 116 was needed to displace oil in the mixed wet case for the water wet experiment the filling sequence was pore size dependent with a strong correlation between pore size and oil occupancy however in the mixed wet experiment the principal determinant of the filling sequence was the wettability rather than the pore size and there was no correlation between pore size and the residual oil occupancy the oil water interfacial area had a larger maximum in the mixed wet case which was supported by the observation of sheet or saddle like menisci shapes present throughout the sample volume that impede the flow these shapes were quantified by much larger negative gaussian curvature which indicated better connectivity of the phases consistent with the lower residual oil saturation mean curvature and associated capillary pressure were positive for the water wet case but decreased to a negative value for the mixed wet case pointing to forced displacement from oil wet pores this analysis explained why the relative permeabilities for the mixed wet case were lower than for the water wet case for the same fractional flow keywords micro ct imaging relative permeability capillary pressure curvature wettability alteration pore occupancy 1 introduction multiphase flow in porous media is encountered in many geophysical and industrial applications such as hydrocarbon recovery carbon dioxide sequestration groundwater management and catalyst supports used in the automotive industry bachu 2003 blunt 2017 narula et al 1996 to design these processes an accurate understanding of the physics of flow at the underlying pore scale is of vital importance in particular the important parameters affecting multiphase flow properties are wettability and pore scale geometry the combination of x ray computed microtomography micro ct as an advanced imaging and analysis tool as well as the use of high pressure high temperature coreflooding apparatus provides a myriad of opportunities to develop insights into the fundamentals of multiphase flow in porous media this methodology can provide not only measurements of capillary pressure andrew et al 2014a armstrong et al 2012 and relative permeability alhammadi et al 2020 gao et al 2017 but also simultaneously includes a characterization of pore structure contact angle and curvature locally on a pore by pore basis alratrout et al 2017 andrew et al 2014b berg et al 2013 blunt et al 2013 herring et al 2013 khishvand et al 2017 saif et al 2019 wildenschild and sheppard 2013 more recently it has been used to measure relative permeability and capillary pressure in water wet and mixed wet sandstones and carbonates alhammadi et al 2020 gao et al 2017 y 2019 lin et al 2018 q 2019 zou et al 2018 however hitherto there has not been a comparative study between water wet and altered wettability porous media with the same pore space geometry that systematically relates local to macroscopic wettability descriptors of multiphase flow behaviour wettability plays an important role in controlling the fluid configuration at the pore scale which in turn impacts capillary pressure and relative permeability anderson 1987a b avraam and payatakes 1995 1999 blunt 2017 hirasaki 1991 since hydrocarbon reservoirs have been saturated with crude oil over geologic times they are typically under altered wettability conditions due to the deposition of surface active components of the oil asphaltenes on the solid surface of the rock buckley et al 1998 kovscek et al 1993 salathiel 1973 this wettability alteration changes the contact angle the angle oil and water interface forms with the solid surface image based measurements of contact angle inside the rock have shown that wettability cannot be described by a single contact angle alhammadi et al 2017 alratrout et al 2017 the wettability of the surface depends on the fluids the surface itself and the local pore geometry and roughness this can result in a range of contact angle both above and below 90 mixed wet conditions which can enable the simultaneous flow of oil and water over a wide range of saturations alratrout et al 2018 while the geometric contact angle which directly measures this angle inside the rock from an image can be used to characterise wettability it does not necessarily describe the contact angle during fluid displacement akai et al 2019 this is because the fluid solid contacts are often pinned with a hinging angle the contact only moves in a displacement when a sufficiently high advancing angle is reached that allows the water to progress across an oil wet surface kovscek et al 1993 the use of energy balance has provided athermodynamic contact angle that captures the wettability consistent with the displacement observed akai et al 2020 blunt et al 2019 in this work we will test both geometric and energy balance approaches to understand wettability zou et al 2018 measured relative permeability in a mixed wet bentheimer sandstone with the wettability altered by an organic chemical octadecyltrichlorosilane ots and compared these results with data obtained from the same sample under water wet conditions lin et al 2019 measured relative permeability and capillary pressure in mixed wet bentheimer and compared these to a water wet case both these studies have found that the oil relative permeability was lower in the mixed wet case before the crossover point the saturation where the two relative permeabilities are equal while the brine relative permeability was higher at the residual oil saturation the low residual oil saturation observed in mixed wet media implies that both oil and water remain connected through the pore space over a wide saturation range alhammadi et al 2017 2020 lin et al 2019 topologically this is linked to the presence of saddle shaped interfaces between oil and water with the two principal curvatures of different sign in orthogonal directions khanamiri et al 2018 this results in a low capillary pressure but high connectivity of both oil and brine alhammadi et al 2020 explored the relative permeability capillary pressure and oil recovery in a mixed wet microporous carbonate and observed saddle shaped interfaces which helped explain the favourable oil recovery obtained moreover the recovery was facilitated by water flowing through micro porosity over a wide range of saturation which was manifested through the low water relative permeability in a modelling study bakhshian et al 2019 analysed the effect of wettability heterogeneity on a co2 brine system in a sandstone using the lattice boltzmann method and found that when the percentage of co2 wet regions increases at a given saturation for the drainage cycle the brine relative permeability is higher the co2 relative permeability is lower and the capillary pressure is lower furthermore using the same method and for the same co2 brine system bakhshian et al 2020 studied the interaction between wettability and heterogeneity for a wide range of contact angle 25 θ 175 and concluded that the both wettability and heterogeneity play an important role determining recovery these previous studies comparing water wet and mixed wet conditions were either performed on different samples or on the same sample but with wettability altered by a chemical instead of crude oil to accurately assess and understand how crude oil alters wettability and how the wettability impacts fluid configurations and flow properties it is necessary to perform both experiments on the same rock sample and use crude oil to mimic realistic reservoir conditions in this paper we study oil and brine configurations in the pore space of the same reservoir sandstone sample under water wet and mixed wet conditions over a range of fractional flows we use x ray imaging combined with pressure measurements to quantify the impact that wettability alteration on a pore by pore basis exerts on pore and throat fluid occupancy and to relate these observations to the measured relative permeability and capillary pressure our goal is to quantify i geometric and thermodynamic contact angles ii oil and brine pore occupancy and pore filling sequence iii interfacial area iv mean curvature v gaussian curvature vi capillary pressure and vii relative permeability using this rich range of multi phase flow descriptors we will accurately discriminate different wettability behaviour at the local pore and macroscopic core scales 2 materials and methods 2 1 rock samples and fluid properties a cylindrical sample of a reservoir sandstone 6 mm in diameter with a length of 32 mm was used in this study as shown in fig 1 the porosity estimated from the micro ct image was 0 184 0 009 in which micro porosity accounted for 0 022 0 003 the micro porosity was measured using differential imaging and will be characterised in section 2 3 2 the helium porosity measured from a cm scale sample from which this smaller sample was drilled was 0 206 based on darcy s law the absolute permeability was calculated by measuring the pressure differential under single phase brine flow to be 9 56 0 06 10 13 m2 the absolute permeability measured using the same method on the cm sized rock from which our sample was taken was 9 8 10 13 m2 the agreement for absolute permeability and porosity between the mm and cm sized samples indicates that the rock is reasonably homogeneous at the mm scale and that our results are likely to be representative of a larger body of rock the oil phase was decalin with a dynamic viscosity of 2 96 0 08 mpa s at 20 c provided by alfa aesar the aqueous brine phase was water doped with 3 5 wt potassium iodide ki which was used as a high contrast dopant to distinguish the brine phase with the other two phases oil and grain the viscosity of the brine was 0 93 0 05 mpa s measured by rheometer mcr301 anton paar and the interfacial tension between oil and water was measured as 51 5 1 6 mn m by the pendant drop method using a rame hart apparatus 590 f4 series at ambient conditions andreas et al 1938 stauffer 1965 the crude oil used for ageing was from the oil field from which the sandstone sample was taken the molecular weight was 229 3 the density and viscosity at 70 c was 864 6 kg m3 and 12 71 mpaˑs respectively the composition of the crude oil was 51 wt saturates 33 6 wt aromatics and 15 4 wt polar measured by total 2 2 experimental methods this study consisted of three main experiments a a steady state flow experiment performed on a water wet sample in which the total flow rate was 0 02 ml min b wettability alteration at high temperature and high pressure on the same sample and c a steady state flow experiment performed on the same sample now with altered wettability in which the total flow rate was again 0 02 ml min the dual injection flow apparatus used in this study is shown in fig 2 the experimental flow apparatus showing the three main components core holder differential pressure transducer and four syringe pumps to apply a constant flow rate as well as confining and back pressure the sample was placed in a fluoro polymer elastomer viton sleeve in the carbon fibre hassler type flow cell fluid flow lines were used to connect the core holder with the pumps brine and oil were injected into the sample through two separate ports to ensure that two fluids flowed into the sample simultaneously for the steady state flow experiments the total flow rate was 0 02 ml min while varying the fractional flow defined as the volumetric flow rate of water brine to the total flow rate brine plus oil the capillary number was 6 6 10 7 based on the definition ca μq σ where μ is the average viscosity of the injected fluids q is the total darcy velocity and σ is the interfacial tension between the two phases this capillary number was chosen to ensure that fixed and stable brine and oil pathways could be observed as shown in our previous work in bentheimer sandstone gao et al 2017 gao et al 2020 the experiments were performed by following the steps 1 the rock sample was put in the viton sleeve in the core holder fluid flow lines were used to connect the pumps and core holder inside the micro ct scanner 2 confining pressure was applied by injecting deionized water into the empty annulus space between the carbon fibre sleeve and the viton sleeve 2 mpa was set for confining pressure to avoid any bypass flow between the sample and the sleeve 3 four continuous images were taken for the whole sample with a voxel size of 6 µm the overlap between one scan to the next was approximately 25 this overlap was used to stitch the two scans together two scans were taken over part of the sample with the voxel size of 3 58 µm the scan position is shown in fig 1 the overlap between these two scans was about 25 as well 4 carbon dioxide was injected for 30 min to replace the air in the sample 5 at least 200 pore volumes pv 30 wt brine was injected into the rock sample to ensure that it was 100 saturated with brine this step was used to measure the sub resolution pore space as the contrast between 30 wt brine and grain was sufficient to observe the change in x ray absorption in micro porosity compared to the dry air saturated scan lin et al 2016 gao et al 2019 alhammadi et al 2020 this will be introduced in detail in section 2 3 2 6 the pressure differential between the inlet and outlet of the sample was measured over two flow rates which was used to calculate the absolute permeability a back pressure of 2 mpa was set for the flow system the confining pressure was set at 4 mpa 7 four brine scans were taken for the whole sample when the voxel size was 6 µm and two more were taken when voxel size was 3 58 µm at the same positions as the dry scans 8 at least 1000 pv 3 5 wt brine was flooded to remove the high salinity brine in the sample 9 at least 110 pv oil was injected from 0 02 ml min to 2 ml min to reach a uniform initial water saturation this is a primary drainage process 10 oil was injected continually at a flow rate of 0 02 ml min when the brine fractional flow was 0 when steady state was identified the measured pressure drop was constant for more than 2 h the scans were taken at the same position as mentioned in step 3 it took approximately 24 h to reach steady state in this experiment 11 step 10 was repeated for fractional flows of fw 0 05 0 15 0 3 0 5 0 7 and 0 95 with a total flow rate of 0 02 ml min the oil flow rate was decreased from 0 019 ml min to 0 001 ml min and the brine flow rate was increased from 0 001 ml min to 0 019 ml min six scans were taken at each fractional flow at steady state at the same position as described in step 3 the pressure differential was recorded throughout the whole experiment 12 at least 110 pv brine was injected from 0 02 ml min to 2 ml min step by step to reach the residual oil saturation then brine injection continued at 0 02 ml min to measure the pressure differential when the fractional flow was 1 six scans were taken at the same position as described in step 3 13 the sample was taken out of the core holder and the pressure differences along the tubing were measured by repeating steps 10 to 12 but without the rock present 14 the brine in the sample was replaced by deionized water and dried in an oven for one week both water and remaining oil in the sample evaporated and left the sample clean and dry then the sample was put into the core holder and then moved into the oven the oven temperature was 80 1 c 15 steps 1 2 4 and 8 were repeated the pore pressure and confining pressure were set to 10 mpa and 12 mpa respectively the sandstone was kept at these conditions for 3 days to allow for ion equilibration occurring between the grains and brine 16 at least 100 pv of heated crude oil about 80 c were injected into the sample from 0 02 ml min to 2 ml min the sandstone sample was kept at these conditions for two weeks then the flow direction was reversed and 100 more pv of crude oil were injected by increasing the flow rate from 0 02 ml min to 2 ml min this was done to obtain a uniform initial brine saturation resulting in a homogeneous wettability alteration the sample was then exposed to the same conditions for three more weeks this whole process is called ageing and is used to alter the wettability of the sample which mimics the reservoir conditions in the subsurface 17 the pore pressure was decreased to 2 mpa and the confining pressure was decreased to 4 mpa the core holder was then isolated by closing the valves connected to the tubing then the core holder was moved into the micro ct scan with the apparatus as shown in fig 2 the pid controller was connected to the core holder and the temperature was set at 70 c to allow the crude oil to flow 18 decalin was injected into the sample to displace the crude oil inside the sample until no crude oil was produced then the temperature was set back to ambient conditions 19 steps 9 to 12 were repeated on the mixed wet sample oil and brine were co injected at eight brine fractional flows f w 0 0 05 0 15 0 3 0 5 0 7 0 95 and 1 at a fixed flow rate of 0 02 ml min and images were taken at the same position as described in step 3 again the pressure differential was recorded throughout the experiment 2 3 imaging methods and processing 2 3 1 imaging method the images were taken by a zeiss xrm 510 x ray microscope using a flat panel detector the x ray energy was 75 kev and the power was 6 5 w the number of projections for each image was 2200 to enhance image quality all tomograms were reconstructed into three dimensional images using the zeiss reconstructor software at each fractional flow the four images with 6 35 µm voxel size were normalized to the brine saturated images as a reference and stitched together to obtain an image of the whole sample as shown on the left in fig 1 the stitched image size was 1000 1000 5340 voxels which measured 6 6 32 mm3 similarly each pair of overlapping images with voxel size of 3 58 µm were normalized to the brine images and then stitched together as shown on the right in fig 1 the stitched image size was 1608 1608 2933 voxels or 6 6 10 5 mm3 all images were registered to the brine images to have the same orientation and the lanczos algorithm was used to resample the images burger and burge 2016 a non local means filter was used to remove noise and smooth the images while preserving edges buades et al 2005 2008 2 3 2 characterization of the pore space differential imaging was used to quantify both the resolvable and the sub resolution pore space 30 wt ki brine increased the contrast between brine and grain and emphasized the sub resolution pore space lin et al 2016 this was analysed from the 6 6 10 5 mm3 sample with a voxel size of 3 58 µm fig 3 a shows a two dimensional slice of the dry scan while fig 3 b shows the same slice of the fully brine saturated image we clearly observe some sub resolution pores with intermediate grey scales in both images indicated by the yellow boxes to quantify the porosity of the sub resolution pore space the differential image between fig 3 b and a is obtained as shown in fig 3 c figs 4 and 5 confirmed that oil did not enter these micro porous regions during the steady state experiments proving that the capillary entry pressure was not sufficiently high for the oil to displace brine from these regions fig 3 d shows the segmented macro pore space table 1 lists the volume fraction of solid grain micro pore space macro pore space and the corresponding porosity the porosity of sub resolution pores is 0 56 0 01 and its contribution to the total porosity is 0 022 0 003 where the total porosity is 0 184 0 009 more details of this method can be found in lin et al 2016 and gao et al 2019 2 3 3 characterization of fluids in the pore space grey scale images for each fractional flow with the voxel size of 3 58 µm from the water wet experiment are illustrated in fig 4 while those from the mixed wet experiment are shown in fig 5 the black is oil the dark grey is grains and the light grey is brine the watershed method was applied to segment the images to oil and water phases beucher and meyer 1993 to quantify oil and brine saturation accurately the images were cropped into cylindrical sections to avoid the sleeve shown at the boundary of the core for the macro pore space the fluids were segmented into brine blue and oil red as shown in fig 6 water wet and fig 7 mixed wet a description of the measurements used for this paper which includes the image size and voxel size are listed in table 2 3 results and discussion we start with wettability characterization by quantifying the geometric and thermodynamic contact angles for the two sets of experiments in section 3 1 then we present fluid occupancy in pores and throats in section 3 2 this is followed by an analysis of interfacial area in section 3 3 in section 3 4 we present interfacial curvature including mean curvature and gaussian curvature then the calculation of capillary pressure from the mean curvature isdescribed in section 3 5 followed by the determination of relative permeability in section 3 6 3 1 wettability characterization fig 8 a shows the configuration of oil and water in a selected region of the pore space under water wet and mixed wet conditions as an example black is oil and light grey is water oil resided in large pores under water wet conditions while it occupied some small pores and corners for the mixed wet case in situ contact angle can be measured from x ray images alhammadi et al 2017 andrew et al 2014b and an automated method has been developed to quantify the distribution of contact angle alratrout et al 2017 we call this the geometric contact angle this automated method identifies the fluid fluid and fluid solid interfaces in the segmented images these interfaces are then smoothed and the three phase contact line where the fluid fluid interface contacts the solid is identified at every voxel in the image on the contact line the two vectors that have a direction which is perpendicular to both surfaces fluid solid and fluid fluid is identified then contact angle values at all recognized oil brine solid contacts can be generated from the dot product of these vectors we used this automated method to measure the distribution of contact angle when the fractional flow was 0 5 shown in fig 8 b the average contact angle was 74 9 and 88 8 for water wet and mixed wet conditions respectively the geometric contact angle for all fractional flows under both conditions are listed in table 3 we can see that there is a wider range of contact angles for mixed wet case with values both above and below 90 the wide range of measured contact angles reflects complex structure of the rough surfaces in the pore space alratrout et al 2018 because the geometric contact angle was measured directly at the three phase contact line from the images this process is particularly sensitive to the image quality and segmentation which introduces uncertainties furthermore because some interfaces between oil and brine may be pinned at the contact line before a higher angle for brine to advance over an altered wettability surface is reached morrow 1970 the measured contact angles may not properly represent the values during a displacement to provide the wettability for a displacement process directly the thermodynamic contact angle considering changes in saturation and interfacial areas between each phase are calculated from an energy balance assuming negligible viscous dissipation blunt et al 2019 1 δ a w s c o s θ t 2 κ ϕ δ s w δ a o w where δaws is the change in the specific interfacial area between water brine and solid θ t is the thermodynamic contact angle κ is the mean curvature ϕ is the porosity δsw is the change in the water brine saturation and δaow is the change in the specific interfacial area between oil and water brine the specific interfacial area here is defined as the surface area per unit volume fig 8 c shows the thermodynamic contact angles calculated for water wet and mixed wet conditions the differences in eq 1 are found from two subsequent fractional flows and the contact angle is shown as a function of the lower fractional flow used in the calculation up to s w 0 3 the contact angle increases to 100 in the mixed wet case and to 80 in the water wet case with further water injection the thermodynamic contact angle increases to 116 in the mixed wet case while it slightly decreases to 65 in the water wet experiment a higher advancing contact angle is needed to displace oil in the mixed wet case as expected brine first fills the more water wet pores and then later less water wet pores more details on how interfacial area changes are provided in section 3 3 and how the water saturation changes in section 3 6 3 2 fluid occupancy in pores and throats we now test how wettability impacts pore and throat occupancy from the segmented images previously shown in figs 6 and 7 the location and size of the pores and or throats occupied by oil and brine are investigated based on the radii of spheres inscribed in the pore space the void space was subdivided into pores representing wider regions and throats representing narrow connections between the pores using a generalized pore network extraction algorithm raeini et al 2017 each voxel is assigned to a unique pore as well as to a unique throat the voxels which are located at local maxima of the distance map the distance of any point in the void space to the nearest solid are assigned as the centres of pore or throat then the volume weighted fraction of pores and throats whose centres were occupied by brine or oil were computed to analyse the statistics of the pore and throat fluid occupancy figs 9 and 10 show the results for different fractional flows for the water wet and mixed wet experiments respectively for both cases the initial water saturation was very low oil resided in almost all the pores and throats consistent with the pore filling sequence for a water wet medium as shown in fig 9 when the fractional flow increased we can see that brine initially filled the smaller elements and then filled progressively larger pores and throats oil always occupied the larger pores and throats when fw increased from 0 05 to 0 7 brine mainly filled in more small pores and the corners of larger pores more brine occupied pores of intermediate size when fw 0 7 for comparison fig 10 illustrates a different pore throat filling sequence in the mixed wet case during the waterflooding process there is no preference for the water to fill either large or small pores this shows that local contact angle rather than pore size is the principal determinant of the filling sequence there is however a tendency for the smaller throats to fill first which indicates that the narrowest restrictions in the pore space remain largely water wet after ageing overall more oil was displaced compared to the water wet case showing that mixed wet conditions give a lower residual oil saturation alhammadi et al 2017 jadhunandan and morrow 1995 to quantify the correlation between the radius of pore space oil occupancy and filling order we calculate the pearson correlation coefficient benesty et al 2009 for the water wet and mixed wet samples the pearson correlation coefficients between oil occupancy at pore and throat centres which is either 1 or 0 and their inscribed radii for each fractional flow are shown in fig 11 the correlation coefficient is computed with pore and throat volumes as weighting factors 2 c c c o v r a σ r σ a where c o v r a i v i a i a r i r i v i is the covariance between radius r and oil occupancy ɑ and σ x c o v x x is the standard deviation v is pore or throat volume and the summation is performed over all pores and throats subscript i for the water wet sample the correlation coefficient initially increases with s w and is approximately 0 6 when s w 0 4 however for the mixed wet experiment the correlation coefficient decreases when s w increases the correlation between pore and throat radius and oil occupancy at the end of water injection is 0 54 in the water wet case while it is 0 06 for the mixed wet data we can conclude that there is a reasonably strong correlation between pore and throat radius and occupancy by oil for the water wet sample but essentially no correlation in the mixed wet case this proves that for the water wet case oil is first pushed out of small pores and then out of some large pores as well in the altered wettability case both small and large pores tend to be filled at low water fractional flows but overall more oil is displaced from large pores than out of smaller pores and hence the correlation coefficients move toward zero and negative values as the fractional flow is increased 3 3 interfacial area fig 12 a shows the oil brine interfaces at f w 0 5 for an image of size 560 560 560 voxels with a voxel size of 3 58 µm as an example the interfaces between oil and brine were extracted and smoothed using a volume preserving gaussian smoothing to remove voxelization artefacts taubin 1995 we can see that the interfaces are quasi spherical in the water wet case while the arrangement of the interfaces is more complex for the mixed wet experiment we observe saddle shaped interfaces with opposite curvatures in orthogonal directions this will be discussed in more detail in section 3 4 the measured specific interfacial area which is the interfacial area per unit volume between oil brine brine solid and oil solid is shown in fig 12 b for both cases the interfacial area between oil and solid was highest at the beginning of the waterflood when oil occupied almost all the pore space for the water wet case at higher water saturations brine starts to fill small pores and the corners of large pores and the water solid interfacial area increased approximately linearly with water saturation while the oil solid interfacial area decreased correspondingly the oil brine interfacial area increased first and reached a maximum at fw 0 7 then decreased at higher fractional flow the menisci between oil and brine contributing to the area principally block pores and throats and add to the resistance to flow at higher fractional flows the oil brine area decreases as there are fewer menisci although it remains high as oil is trapped in the larger pore spaces surrounded by brine for the mixed wet case the oil solid interfacial area initially decreases rapidly which represents the displacement of oil from some of the larger pores the final area at the end of waterflooding is lower than in the water wet case since the remaining oil saturation is lower the oil brine interfacial area increased initially with fractional flow and reached a maximum at fw 0 5 then decreased the maximum oil water interfacial area was approximately 50 larger in the mixed wet case which is consistent with the visualizations in fig 12 a showing sheet or saddle like menisci spanning the sample 3 4 curvature analysis the gaussian curvature is defined as k κ 1 κ 2 berger and gostiaux 2012 gauss and pesic 2005 where κ1 and κ2 are the two principal curvatures and we define κ 1 κ 2 the mean curvature is κ κ 1 κ 2 2 both mean and gaussian curvatures were analysed on the same sub volume considered for interfacial area in the previous section the mean curvature was measured on the connected oil phase and brine clusters of volume greater than 0 01 mm3 in the water wet case the curvature values larger than 0 2 μm 1 or smaller than 0 2 μm 1 were considered as outliers caused by segmentation artefacts and were excluded from the analysis alhammadi et al 2020 lin et al 2018 2019 in the mixed wet case curvature values larger than 0 25 μm 1 or smaller than 0 25 μm 1 were excluded fig 13 illustrates the mean curvature distribution at fw 0 5 for both cases where we identify three possibilities κ 1 0 κ 2 0 κ 1 κ 2 0 and κ 1 0 κ 2 0 the mean curvature distribution includes measurements for both connected and disconnected oil brine interfaces in the water wet case most interfaces have two positive principal curvatures although in many cases one curvature is positive and the other negative this represents arc menisci in the corners of the pore space andrew et al 2014a the percentage of the principal curvature groups defining different gaussian curvatures that have both positive both negative and one positive one negative principal curvatures is 58 8 0 2 and 41 0 respectively the interfaces with one positive curvature and the other negative are important to maintain connectivity of the oil as discussed later there are almost no interfaces with two negative principal curvatures indicating that water is well connected in the mixed wet experiment there are more negative curvatures than positive curvatures and most of the curvatures have one positive and one negative value giving a negative gaussian curvature the percentage of the principal curvature groups that have both positive both negative and one positive one negative principal curvatures is 3 9 32 8 and 63 3 respectively as we show later this has implications for oil connectivity there are more interfaces that have two negative principal curvatures than the ones that have two positive curvatures this implies poor water connectivity but better oil connectivity signifying a lower residual oil saturation fig 14 a shows the distributions of the two principal curvatures κ 1 and κ 2 for the water wet experiment at f w 0 5 and for the mixed wet experiment at f w 0 05 and f w 0 5 fig 14 b shows the corresponding gaussian curvatures for the connected oil phase both κ 1 and κ 2 distributions are more negative in the mixed wet case for the water wet case at f w 0 5 κ 1 is always positive while κ 2 has both negative and positive values for the mixed wet case both κ 1 and κ 2 shift towards more negative values from the f w 0 05 to f w 0 5 this difference in principal curvatures for f w 0 05 and f w 0 5 is sufficiently large that as we will show in section 3 5 for the former this results in a positive mean curvature and hence positive capillary pressure while for the latter capillary pressure is negative moreover the distributions are wider in the mixed wet case implying more negative gaussian curvatures leading to simultaneous flow of oil and brine as shown in fig 14 b fig 15 shows the mean curvature for all eight fractional flows here we consider the connected oil phase only which contributed to the flow in the beginning of waterflooding as brine preferentially filled more water wet regions of the pore space the shape of oil brine menisci was almost spherical with a positive mean curvature for the water wet case the mean curvatures for all fractional flows remained positive consistent with previous experiments on water wet bentheimer sandstone lin et al 2018 however in the mixed wet case for fw 0 3 invasion principally filled oil wet regions where the thermodynamic contact angle for displacement was greater than 90 see fig 8 c as a result the mean curvatures were negative again as seen in a mixed wet bentheimer lin et al 2019 and an aged reservoir carbonate alhammadi et al 2020 fig 16 demonstrates the average gaussian curvature for the eight fractional flows by considering all the interfaces between oil and brine as mentioned at the start of this section gaussian curvature is the product of the two principal curvatures in orthogonal directions the gauss bonnet theorem provides a relationship between the topology of the oil clusters and the integral of the gaussian curvature across the bounding surface allendoerfer and weil 1943 armstrong et al 2019 blunt et al 2020 the more negative the value of this integral the better connected the object considered here connectivity refers to the number of redundant loops in the structure in our context for a negative gaussian curvature when water invades oil occupied pores and throats the oil remains connected since filling does not disconnect the oil clusters in both cases the gaussian curvatures are negative with a similar magnitude when fw 1 which shows that the oil connectivity remains high even when more brine was injected into the sample the absolute value of average gaussian curvature obtained from the mixed wet case was larger than that obtained from water wet case implying that the oil connectivity was better in mixed wet case as the oil can remain in layers even in water occupied pores and throats which is consistent with a lower residual oil saturation at fw 1 the end point the oil is disconnected and hence trapped and in both cases the gaussian curvature therefore is as expected positive as fig 17 a shows the volume of trapped oil ganglia under water wet conditions was larger than that under mixed wet conditions and this is supported by the ganglia size distribution analysis shown in fig 17 b in the water wet case we see fewer small trapped clusters and more larger clusters as opposed to the mixed wet system where the remaining oil resides in smaller pores and as layers 3 5 capillary pressure capillary pressure is defined as the pressure difference between the oil and brine phases pc po pw the local capillary pressure has been calculated from mean interfacial curvature from pore scale images section 3 4 using the young laplace law 3 p c 2 σ κ the capillary pressure calculated from eq 3 using the mean curvature shown in fig 15 is illustrated in fig 18 the uncertainties in saturation are estimated from likely uncertainties in the image segmentation the uncertainties in capillary pressure are calculated from the variations in the mean interfacial curvature for the water wet case the capillary pressure is positive and gradually decreases with saturation here oil is displaced from water wet pores by spontaneous imbibition for the mixed wet case capillary pressure becomes negative signifying water injection for which water needs to be forced into more oil wet pores resulting in additional recovery the primary drainage capillary pressure was measured on a separate sample taken from the same larger block of sandstone as the one used in these experiments 3 6 relative permeability darcy s law was used to calculate the relative permeabilities for the sample under water wet and mixed wet conditions the brine saturation at each fractional flow was measured from the images of the whole sample see fig 1 the brine saturation profiles measured across the whole sample for all fractional flows are shown in fig 19 this accounts for both brine in the macro pores explicitly resolvable in the segmented images and brine in micro porosity see section 2 3 2 fig 19 a1 and b1 shows the brine saturation profiles averaged in slices perpendicular to the flow direction for all the eight fractional flows over the length of the whole image taken with a voxel size of 6 35 µm under water wet and mixed wet conditions respectively for comparison fig 19 a2 and b2 shows the brine saturation profiles over the part of the sample scanned with the voxel size of 3 58 µm under water wet and mixed wet conditions respectively since there is no discernible saturation gradient we do not correct for the capillary pressure gradients caused by capillary end effect lin et al 2019 which is not unexpected in systems with low capillary pressure the pressure differentials across the sample at steady state were recorded by a precise differential transducer pd 33x keller with a range of 500 kpa and the accuracy was 0 05 of the whole range table 4 presents the pressure differential and its standard deviation for both water wet and mixed wet experiments the relative permeabilities were calculated by 4 k r w q w μ w l δ p k k r o q o μ o l δ p k where kr is the relative permeability of each phase q is the darcy velocity of each phase μ is the viscosity l is the length of the whole sample δp is the pressure differential along the sample and k is the absolute permeability the subscript w represents the brine water phase and o represents the oil table 4 presents the brine water saturation and the relative permeabilities at each fractional flow for these two experiments fig 20 shows the measured relative permeabilities for the same sample under water wet and mixed wet conditions error bars in the x direction consider uncertainties caused by segmentation error bars in the y direction consider uncertainties caused by the measurement of the length and diameter pressure measurement and the pump rates in the water wet case the initial water saturation was 0 20 in the mixed wet case the initial water saturation was 0 17 in both cases the initial water principally resides in sub resolution micro porosity see section 2 3 2 initially f w 0 kro is slightly higher in the mixed wet case however during displacement at the same fractional flow between 0 15 and 0 95 both water and oil relative permeabilities in the mixed wet case are lower than those in water wet case menisci spanning the pore space impede the flow of the fluids the lower relative permeabilities in the mixed wet case are consistent with the larger oil brine interfacial areas measured see fig 12 while in the mixed wet case brine occupies some of the larger pores fig 10 these pores do not connect across the pore space until a high brine saturation is reached which keeps the water relative permeability low the oil relative permeability is also low as the oil now is confined to smaller pores these results are consistent with previous measurements on a mixed wet bentheimer sandstone lin et al 2019 and a reservoir carbonate alhammadi et al 2020 at the end point f w 1 krw in the mixed wet case with a residual oil saturation of 0 18 is higher than that in water wet case which has a higher residual oil saturation of 0 26 this is consistent with the connectivity analysis based on gaussian curvature fig 16 that indicates that the oil is better connected in the mixed wet case the water tends to occupy some of the larger pores particularly near the end point as seen in fig 10 which explains the higher end point water relative permeability compared to the water wet experiment where water only resides in the smaller pores see fig 9 our results are compared with the experimental results obtained from bentheimer sandstone under water wet conditions by gao et al 2017 and lin et al 2018 2019 under both water wet and mixed wet conditions bentheimer has a similar pore structure porosity and permeability to the reservoir sample here although it contains a negligible amount of micro porosity these results show similar trends for both the water wet and mixed wet cases there is however one crucial difference in bentheimer the cross over saturation where the two relative permeabilities are equal in the mixed wet case was higher implying in mainly cases a more favourable waterflood oil recovery blunt 2017 in our experiments the water saturation of the cross over point is similar under both conditions this cross over is governed by a subtle balance of pore occupancy and connectivity controlled by pore structure and wettability in bentheimer the water filled some larger pores under mixed wet conditions but these pores remained poorly connected in our experimentsexperiments we observe the same phenomenon but the water relative permeability rises slightly more rapidly this is likely due to increases in connectivity and conductivity mediated by the small amount of water filled micro porosity which is absent in bentheimer 4 conclusions to assess the impact of wettability on two phase flow signatures in porous media we combined micro ct imaging with a waterflood experiment and conducted steady state measurements on one reservoir sandstone sample under both water wet and mixed wet conditions the comparison of wettability pore occupancy interfacial area mean curvature gaussian curvature capillary pressure and relative permeability in the same rock sample allows us to obtain a rich understanding of the two phase displacement mechanisms and changes in pore occupancy caused by wettability alteration 1 the measured average of geometric contact angles was within the range of 74 76 under water wet conditions while it was 88 91 for mixed wet conditions the thermodynamic contact angle computed for displacement using energy balance was approximately 65 in the water wet case but 116 in the mixed wet sample at the end of the displacement 2 brine mainly filled small pores and throats and the corners of larger pores and oil occupied the large pores for the water wet case while pores of all size were filled during waterflooding in the mixed wet case 3 for both water wet and mixed wet experiments with an increase in water fractional flow the oil brine interfacial area increased reached a maximum value and then decreased the oil brine interfacial area was 50 larger in the mixed wet case implying greater blocking of the pore space by menisci 4 the mean curvatures for the connected oil phase were positive in the water wet case while they were positive at the start of waterflooding and then became negative for fractional flows f w 0 15 in the mixed wet experiment as more oil wet regions of the pore space were invaded 5 the average gaussian curvatures defined as the product of the two principal curvatures was negative during the displacement implying connected phases the gaussian curvature was lower more negative in the mixed wet case which explains the better connectivity of the oil phase and the lower residual oil saturation 6 capillary pressure was calculated from the mean interfacial curvature for the water wet case capillary pressures were positive and decreased slowly with an increase of f w for the mixed wet case capillary pressures were positive at the start and became negative when f w 0 15 7 relative permeabilities were calculated from the pressure differential measured during the experiment and the saturation calculated based on the images consistent with the analysis of pore occupancy and interfacial area the relative permeabilities for the mixed wet case were lower for the same fractional flow the water relative permeability in the mixed wet case remained low at intermediate saturation since the water even if it resided in some of the larger pores did not have connected pathways of wide pores through the pore space at a higher water saturation the water relative permeability rose to a higher value than in the water wet case where the water was always confined to the smaller pores and throats the oil relative permeability in the mixed wet case was low since now oil occupied some of the smaller pores and throats with low conductance this imaging experimental and analysis approach provides rich data sets to understand two phase flow through porous media the results can be used to benchmark and validate pore scale models in the future this method can be further applied in more heterogeneous rocks and mixed wet systems furthermore this method can be applied to study various other porous medium problems including fuel cells water and

387,multiphase flow in porous media is found in a variety of engineering problems including in technologies focused on satisfying the energy needs of an expanding global population while minimizing the effects of human activity on climate change the objective of this study is to provide a better understanding of the importance and interdependence of the wettability altered fraction the degree of wettability alteration and the spatially varying contact angle assignment in influencing the pore scale and macroscale flow properties in order to conduct this investigation and analyze the effects on the relative permeability curves and fluid configurations the shan chen multi relaxation time multicomponent lattice boltzmann model with explicit forcing is utilized and domains of increasing fractions of wettability altered pores are generated we find that the fraction altered the degree of alteration and the accurate contact angle assignment are all correlated and play a role to varying extents in influencing the flow behavior and the resulting relative permeability curves the fraction altered displays the strongest effect and the effects of the degree of alteration and contact angle assignment become more significant when a larger fraction of the sample has undergone wettability alteration a sample that has undergone fractional wettability alteration results in a larger resistance to the overall flow and more tortuous flow paths at intermediate saturations in comparison to a strongly water oil wetting domain in a high porosity domain that is becoming increasingly oil wet the degree of wettability alteration has a more pronounced effect on the flow behavior of the oil phase whereas the flow of the water phase remains dictated by the large pore spaces and the regions of the domain that have not undergone wettability alteration until a significant fraction of the domain has been altered moreover a spatially varying contact angle assignment becomes more important for a system with a large distribution of contact angles the results demonstrate the correlations between wettability alteration and pore geometry and highlight the need for an algorithm that captures the true time dependent wettability state of a porous medium sample keywords relative permeability wettability alteration porous media multiphase flow lattice boltzmann method mrt 1 introduction many of the pressing challenges of the twenty first century are dictated by the physics of multiphase flow in porous media these challenges include but are not limited to providing an uninterrupted energy supply and access to clean water for a rapidly growing global population while mitigating the harmful environmental impacts of human activity on climate change a substantial portion of the world s current energy sources are located in porous underground reservoirs in the form of hydrocarbons moreover carbon capture and sequestration ccs which involves capturing and injecting carbon dioxide in porous underground reservoirs is an increasingly implemented method which aims to minimize these emissions and thus reduce the effects of human activity on climate change many other scientific and engineering applications such as fuel cells contaminant transport and membranes for desalination are governed by the principles of flow in porous media hence it is of paramount importance to continue to enhance our understanding of the relevant physical phenomena associated with flow in porous media blunt 2017 the relative permeability of a porous medium is a measure of the sample s ability to conduct one fluid in the presence of one or more other fluids anderson 1987 the relative permeability curves are a function of many parameters such as the pore geometry topology capillary number viscosity ratio saturation history and wettability warner 2015 zhao et al 2017 the wettability of a porous medium can be defined as the competition between multiple immiscible fluids to adhere on the medium s solid surface and plays an important role in influencing multiphase flow in porous media warner 2015 wettability at the pore scale is typically defined using the contact angle which is the angle that the fluid fluid interface forms with the solid surface zhao et al 2018 o carroll et al 2005 a fluid is said to preferentially wet the surface if the contact angle it forms is less than 90 wettability is a significant parameter that controls the pore scale flow behavior and the resulting macroscale multiphase properties such as relative permeability and capillary pressure murison et al 2014 bakhshian and hosseini 2019 for example in cieplak and robbins 1990 the impact of wettability on the capillary displacement in a two dimensional porous media was investigated by varying the contact angle of the invading fluid in the non wetting limit the fluid invasion pattern was consistent with percolation and the growth of the invading cluster occurred in bursts as the domain became more wetting to the invading fluid growth mechanisms became dominated by overlaps and touches and the finger width in the invasion pattern increased until a divergence of the finger width was observed at a critical contact angle below the critical contact angle a transition from percolation to a uniform flood occurred additionally in zhao et al 2016 the effect of wettability on viscously unfavorable fluid fluid displacement was analyzed and it was shown that increasing the wettability of the domain with respect to the invading fluid improved the efficiency of the defending fluid displacement due to cooperative pore filling until a critical wetting transition was reached and the trend was reversed wettability has also been investigated in the context of residual trapping it has been demonstrated that the wettability distribution strongly impacts capillary trapping with conflicting recommendations about the optimal wettability condition in order to suppress or improve residual trapping chaudhary et al 2013 rahman et al 2016 herring et al 2016 wang et al 2016 the wettability distribution of a porous medium sample can either be homogeneous or heterogeneous for the homogeneous case the various fluids have a uniform wetting preference throughout the whole sample most previous studies have investigated multiphase flow in systems with homogeneous wettability distributions despite the significant impact of wettability heterogeneity on relative permeability capillary pressure and recovery efficiency bakhshian and hosseini 2019 masalmeh 2003 in many of the systems of interest and for example in a drainage process where oil displaces an initially water saturated porous medium wettability alteration typically occurs due to polar interactions between the oil and the solid surface buckley and liu 1998 a similar phenomenon occurs in contaminant transport where non aqueous phase liquid napl additives adsorb onto the solid surface harrold et al 2001 as a result a heterogeneous wettability distribution mixed wet system is typically encountered in these systems and providing a better understanding of its effect on both the pore scale and macroscale flow properties is an important task 1 1 background an understanding of the microscopic physics serves as a prelude towards determining the macroscopic transport properties of flow in porous media however characterizing and predicting the pore scale physics in porous media involves many challenges the most prominent challenge stems from the heterogeneous complicated and system dependent topology of porous media armstrong et al 2016 in these geological systems the size of the highly heterogeneous pores where the fluids reside is on the order of micrometers dullien 2012 therefore typical macroscale darcy s law based models which neglect the pore scale flow details fail to effectively capture many commonly observed physical phenomena such as hysteresis capillary trapping and haines jump schlüter et al 2016 andrew et al 2015 berg et al 2013 2016 as a result in order to improve our understanding of the microscale fundamental mechanisms that result in the macroscale natural processes correctly capturing and simulating the pore scale physical behavior in these systems is necessary the continuing advancements in computational tools and the development of image processing methods have enabled numerical models to become an attractive solution to quickly and cost efficiently simulate and understand the pore scale physics in porous media zhao et al 2019 several numerical methods have been proposed in order to investigate multiphase flow within porous media these methods include the lattice boltzmann method lbm boek and venturoli 2010 ramstad et al 2012 pore scale network modeling pnm blunt and king 1991 blunt 2001 and grid based computational fluid dynamics cfd methods such as the volume of fluid vof method raeini et al 2012 rabbani et al 2018 the level set ls method jettestuen et al 2013 and the phase field method cogswell and szulczewski 2017 pore scale network modeling is implemented by constructing a sample network of pores and throats representing the porous medium of interest and simulating the fluid flow on the extracted network xiong et al 2016 oren et al 1998 piri and blunt 2005 the main advantage of pnm is the computational efficiency making the method ideal for use on large samples however the main drawback of this approach is that a medium s heterogeneity is incorporated by making simplifications in the domain representation jiang et al 2007 and therefore the networks do not capture the true pore structure and connectivity of a sample that can be obtained by advanced tomographic imaging golparvar et al 2018 as a result losses in accuracy are expected as the medium complexity increases liu et al 2016 traditional grid based computational fluid dynamics cfd methods solve the navier stokes equations while implementing a technique to track and capture the fluid fluid interface the main difficulties associated with grid based cfd methods are capturing and tracking the dynamic fluid fluid interface for multiphase flows in addition to incorporating fluid solid interfacial effects golparvar et al 2018 liu et al 2016 as an alternative the lbm is a robust and efficient algorithm which can be used to simulate flows in geometrically complex porous media the lbm utilizes particle distribution functions pdfs or simply particles to model a group of fluid molecules succi 2001 and is ideal for use with micro computed tomography micro ct scanned images of porous media thus enabling the precise determination of transport properties in real porous media in addition capturing the interface is not required in the lbm since the interface arises automatically due to phase separation chen and doolen 1998 the lbm also has further advantages such as local computation which increases the method s suitability for parallel implementation and improves its computational efficiency harting et al 2005 as a result the lbm is a strong candidate for investigating and simulating multiphase and multicomponent flows in porous media various multiphase and multicomponent models have been proposed such as the pseudo potential model shan and chen 1993 color gradient model gunstensen et al 1991 free energy model swift et al 1996 and mean field model he et al 1999 the lbm has been gaining in popularity for simulating multiphase flow in porous media on both realistic ramstad et al 2012 tsuji et al 2016 and ideal pore structures sphere packs li et al 2018 liu et al 2015 pore scale lbm simulations investigating the effects of various parameters such as the pore structure capillary number viscosity ratio interfacial tension and wettability on the relative permeability curves have been conducted zhao et al 2018 boek and venturoli 2010 pan et al 2004 martys and chen 1996 zhang et al 2016 ghassemi and pak 2011 hazlett et al 1998 landry et al 2014 dou and zhou 2013 bakhshian et al 2019 however lbm investigations of the impact of mixed wettability systems on relative permeability are more limited for example in the work of hazlett et al 1998 and landry et al 2014 the wettability is altered at the portion of the domain in contact with the non wetting phase at the end of drainage furthermore a sensitivity analysis is conducted to investigate the impact of the degree of wettability alteration for a given initial fluid saturation in landry et al 2014 it was found that the non wetting phase is more sensitive to wettability alteration and displays a decrease in relative permeability whereas minimal changes are observed in the wetting phase relative permeability this is in contrast to the pore network modeling study of gharbi and blunt 2012 which found a significant reduction in both the non wetting and wetting phase relative permeability in a mixed wet limestone an additional investigation was conducted in zhao et al 2018 where the relative permeability curves were obtained for increasing oil wet solid fractions of an initially fully water wet domain similarly the impact of wettability heterogeneity on the pore scale displacement dynamics and the capillary trapping mechanism in a supercritical co 2 brine system was investigated in bakhshian and hosseini 2019 it was found that the heterogeneous wettability distributions have a significant impact on the fluid distributions resulting in more tortuous flow paths and a higher interfacial area between the fluid phases moreover the impact of wettability also extends to the fluid entrapment patterns and the phase connectivity in all of these investigations the wettability is altered to a constant value however in the recent study of akai et al 2019 in situ measured experimental contact angles were incorporated into the simulations and compared against a waterflooding experiment the assignment of a constant and non uniform contact angle was investigated and it was found that the constant contact angle assignment predicted a 54 higher water effective permeability while the spatially varying contact angle assignment resulted in less than 1 relative error the objective of this study is to investigate the relative importance of the wettability altered fraction the portion of the domain undergoing wettability alteration the degree of wettability alteration the extent wettability is varied at the wettability altered fractions and the accurate contact angle assignment and their effects on relative permeability and fluid configurations using the shan chen multicomponent lattice boltzmann method scmc lbm in order to conduct the investigation domains of increasing fractions of wettability altered pores are created and the impacts on relative permeability and fluid configuration are studied by assigning both a uniform and spatially varying contact angle at the wettability altered portion of the domain the goal is to motivate the need for a time dependent wettability alteration algorithm for the lbm in the next section the shan chen multi relaxation time mrt multicomponent lattice boltzmann model is introduced and the steps associated with implementing the model are explained the model is then validated using standard benchmark tests static droplet contact angle and layered flow following that the effects of the capillary number driving force viscosity ratio and varying homogeneous wettability are studied in order to confirm that the model captures the expected trends in relative permeability in the heterogeneous wettability test domains of increasing wettability altered fractions are used and the impacts of the degree of wettability alteration are analyzed using both a constant and a spatially varying contact angle assignment in the final section conclusions are drawn and suggestions for future work are provided 2 methods shan chen multicomponent lattice boltzmann model scmc lbm with explicit forcing in this work we employ the scmc lbm with the mrt collision model wolf gladrow 2004

introduced the scmc lbm model is validated using three standard benchmarks tests the young laplace test the contact angle test and layered flow 3 1 1 the young laplace test the aim of the young laplace validation is to test the model s capability for accurately defining an interfacial tension and forming a sharp interface between the two fluid components moreover it is used to establish a relationship between the fluid fluid interaction parameter g σ σ and the interfacial tension σ for a droplet of one fluid suspended in another fluid at mechanical equilibrium the difference in pressure inside and outside of the droplet δ p should be inversely proportional to the radius of the droplet r the constant of proportionality is the interfacial tension the laplace pressure in 2d is given by 16 δ p σ r a circular droplet of one component is initialized in the center of the other component and the system is allowed to reach steady state in the absence of any external forcing the system is periodic in the x and y directions succi 2001 maier et al 1996 for each viscosity ratio tested five droplets are initialized of initial radii r i 15 20 25 30 50 lu the viscosity ratio of the system is the ratio of the viscosity of the non wetting nw phase to the viscosity of the wetting w phase and is altered by varying the relaxation rates s v σ of each component the simulation domain size is taken to be five times the initial radius in both the x and y directions the steady state criterion is given by eq 17 17 y u y y t u y y t 1 000 2 y u y y t 2 10 5 once steady state is reached the final droplet formed is plotted as shown in fig 1 the pressure difference across the interface and the final radius of the droplet are determined and plotted as shown in fig 2 in all of the simulations described in this paper the wetting and non wetting fluid densities ρσ in lattice units is scaled to 1 0 ρ w ρ n w 1000 k g m 3 the viscosity ratios investigated are m 0 1 1 0 10 and 100 the value of the fluid fluid interaction parameter resulting in a sharp interface between the two fluids is determined and utilized in all of the remaining simulations g σ σ 3 1 the resulting interfacial tension in lattice units is 0 0925 σ 15 m n m the procedure for converting lattice units to physical units involves determining scaling quantities for length l time t and fluid density m zhao et al 2018 liu et al 2015 ramstad et al 2010 due to the diffusive nature of the pseudo potential model li et al 2018 shan and doolen 1996 both wetting and non wetting phases coexist at each fluid node for example at a fluid node where the w phase density is much larger than the nw phase density the minor phase nw phase can be considered to be dissolved in the major phase therefore the minor phase has a finite and negligible density at fluid nodes with a much larger major phase density typically major to minor phase density vary by over 3 4 orders of magnitude so that the presence of the minor phase can be assumed to be negligible as observed in fig 2 the model indeed satisfies laplace s law and as expected a linear function relating the pressure difference and the radius of the droplet is obtained furthermore the interfacial tension is a function of the fluid fluid interaction parameter only g σ σ and roughly independent of the viscosity ratio of the fluids 3 1 2 contact angle test a contact angle test is conducted in order to test the wetting boundary condition introduced earlier and to obtain the resulting contact angles under different values of the fluid solid interaction parameter gσs a semicircular droplet of one component is initialized at the center of the channel wall surrounded by the second component the domain used is 125 127 lu 2 and the bounce back boundary condition no slip zero velocity he and luo 1997 is implemented at the channel walls while the periodic boundary condition is implemented at the inlet and outlet of the domain similar to the young laplace test the system is allowed to reach steady state in the absence of any external forcing once the interfacial tension value is set by g σ σ the value of gσs is varied and the resulting contact angle measured in fig 3 a sample droplet is shown for a weak wetting case for different values of gσs the resulting contact angles are plotted in fig 4 a linear fit of the contact angle data is used in order to obtain a relationship between gσs and θ for the given interfacial tension value θ 157 26 g σ s 91 731 this relationship can prove useful when simulating a domain with heterogeneous wettability 3 1 3 layered flow for the final validation test the layered flow problem is chosen since it tests the model s capability of obtaining accurate velocity profiles and as a result relative permeability curves for different viscosity ratios under varying saturations of the two fluids in the layered flow problem the nw fluid is initialized in the center of the domain while the w fluid flows along the boundary as shown in fig 5 periodic boundary conditions are implemented at the inlet outlet ends of the domain while the bounce back boundary condition is utilized along the solid walls an external body force is used to drive the flow f b 1 10 6 in the x direction the simulation domain is 20 201 lu 2 the analytical velocity profile and the resulting relative permeability curves are obtained using the following equations zhao et al 2018 kang et al 2004 huang and lu 2009 ba et al 2016 18 u x n w a 1 y 2 c 1 0 y a 19 u x w a 2 y 2 b 2 y c 2 a y b where u x nw and u x w are the velocities of the non wetting and wetting fluids in the x direction the parameters are computed as follows a 1 f b 2 ρ n w v n w a 2 f b 2 ρ w v w b 2 2 a 2 a 2 m a 1 a c 1 a 2 a 1 a 2 b 2 b a a 2 b 2 and c 2 a 2 b 2 b 2 b where vnw and vw are the kinematic viscosities of the non wetting and wetting fluids and m μ n w μ w is the dynamic viscosity ratio in figs 6 and 7 we demonstrate the model s capability of handling a wide range of viscosity ratios as shown an excellent fit between the simulated and analytical velocity profiles is observed however the more important validations associated with the layered flow problem for the application of flow in porous media are the relative permeability curves obtained we focus on a viscosity ratio equal to 10 and conduct the simulation for varying initial values of the w fluid saturation the velocity profiles are obtained and the relative permeability curves are generated from the integration of the velocity profiles using eqs 20 and 21 20 k r w s w y a l u w d y y 0 l u w d y 21 k r n w s w y 0 a u n w d y y 0 l u n w d y the theoretical relative permeability curves are a function of the viscosity ratio and initial fluid saturation as shown in eqs 22 and 23 yiotis et al 2007 22 k r w 1 2 s w 2 3 s w 23 k r n w s n w 3 2 m s n w 2 1 3 2 m where s n w a b is the saturation of the non wetting phase and s w 1 a b is the saturation of the wetting phase similarly an excellent agreement is observed between the theoretical and computed relative permeability values as shown in fig 8 for the w fluid at lower saturations we observe very thin layers which flow very slowly which in turn explains the low relative permeability as the saturation is further increased the relative permeability value approaches the absolute permeability k r 1 as if the w fluid is the only fluid in the system and experiences no impediment to flow due to the presence of the nw fluid for the nw fluid we observe more interesting results where the relative permeability values are greater than one this is due to the lubricating effect that the w fluid provides to the nw fluid since the nw fluid is confined to the center of the domain the w fluid flows in layers adjacent to the solid boundaries and enhances the movement of the nw fluid through the center of the channel for all intermediate saturation values blunt 2017 3 2 relative permeability of a sphere pack in order to conduct more representative simulations the remaining simulations are performed on the sphere pack slice shown in fig 9 obtained from the digital rocks portal finney 2016 the sphere pack image is obtained by x ray microtomography with a resolution of 5 7μm and the porosity of the sphere pack sample is 0 3421 the pore size distribution of the sample is presented in fig 10 rabbani et al 2014 the density and viscosity ratios are both set to unity for all the remaining simulations except for when the effect of the viscosity ratio is studied which is adequate for approximating a water napl system in a capillary force dominated regime where the density and viscosity of the two components are of the same order of magnitude li et al 2018 the interfacial tension is 15 m n m periodic boundary conditions are implemented in the x and y directions and the fluids are initialized according to li et al 2018 as shown in fig 11 the width of the wetting non wetting fluid regions are varied in order to adjust the saturations the procedure for determining the final fluid saturations and the resulting relative permeability is obtained from li et al 2018 in the following three sections we focus on the effect of the capillary number viscosity ratio and wettability in order to observe whether the model captures the expected trends 3 2 1 effect of capillary number the effect of the capillary ca number i e the ratio of viscous forces to capillary forces is tested by varying the force driving the fluids which is equivalent to changing the pressure gradient three driving forces f b 9 10 6 4 10 5 and 6 10 5 are applied on both the w and nw fluids which are roughly equivalent to capillary numbers of c a 9 7 10 5 4 3 10 4 and 6 5 10 4 the effect of the ca number is tested on a strong wetting domain θ 20 and under the same initial fluid saturations and configurations a strong wetting domain is chosen to simulate a drainage process where oil nw displaces water w in a strong water wetting medium due to the large computational burden of the simulations and the numerous investigations to be conducted we performed the ca number test on the two subset domain sizes shown in fig 12 in order to obtain a representative elementary volume rev capable of capturing the expected trends the simulation domain sizes are 401 401 lu 2 por 0 3924 and 601 601 lu 2 por 0 3439 respectively the porosity of the original sphere pack sample is 0 3426 the relative permeability values are computed across the whole saturation range tested for the three ca numbers investigated and are plotted in fig 12 as observed the two domains are capable of capturing qualitatively similar trends with increasing ca numbers however the trends are more pronounced in the 401 401 lu 2 domain owing to the higher porosity and lower tortuosity of the sample since porosity and permeability do not vary significantly between the subset domain 601 601lu 2 and the original sample 788 788 lu 2 we conclude that the 601 601 lu 2 domain is a suitable rev however since the correct trends are captured using both subset domain sizes we conclude that both domains can be used in order to capture qualitatively the effect of different parameters on relative permeability therefore we will utilize the 601 601 lu 2 subset domain in order to test the effect of the capillary number viscosity ratio and wettability and investigate the model s capability of capturing the expected behavior following that we will investigate the role of heterogeneous wettability on both the 401 401 lu 2 subset domain and the original sphere pack image 788 788lu 2 in order to analyze the effect of pore geometry and obtain results of the highest accuracy as shown in fig 12 the relative permeability values of both the w and nw fluids increase for a higher ca number across the whole saturation range moreover the cross over saturation is greater than 0 5 for both ca numbers which is expected in a wetting system the relative permeability curves generated demonstrate a similar trend with the changing ca number as was observed in li et al 2005 and langaas and papatzacos 2001 the relative permeability curves for both phases increase and approach a straight line as the capillary number is increased towards the viscous limit and the effect of capillary forces is overcome longeron 1980 the relative permeability values of both fluids show a smaller variation with saturation for low saturation values of a specific component with a more abrupt increase in relative permeability as the saturation is increased further beyond the cross over saturation in order to better understand and explain the observed relative permeability curves the fluid distributions at equivalent increasing time steps for the three ca numbers are investigated at sw 0 5 and provided in fig 13 by comparing the fluid distributions at equivalent time steps columns evidence of a faster evolution is observed throughout the domain for a higher ca number as is expected however in order to better understand the pore scale flow details which are resulting in these larger relative permeability values a closer look at the pore scale behavior is needed the nw fluid takes the form of disconnected blobs or ganglion which are trapped either in dead end pores or the larger pores a consequence of the wettability condition capillary forces ensure that the nw fluid remains trapped in these large pores however as the driving force ca number increases evidence of the nw fluid overcoming the entry capillary pressure of tighter pore spaces is evident in fig 13 as a result the connectivity of the nw fluid increases and additional flow paths are created which results in an enhancement of the overall relative permeability of the nw fluid across the whole saturation range huang and lu 2009 shi and tang 2018 the w fluid is found adjacent to the solid surface entrapped in the tighter regions of the pore space due to the wettability condition and demonstrates increasing relative permeability values with a larger driving force 3 2 2 effect of viscosity ratio in the second investigation the effect of the viscosity ratio m is tested the capillary number is set at c a 6 5 10 4 and the wettability of the porous medium is set to a strong wetting condition θ 20 the viscosity ratios simulated are m 1 0 and 10 the fluid saturations and configurations are initialized similar to the ca number investigation in order to ensure consistency of results the relative permeability values are determined for the viscosity ratios investigated and are plotted in fig 14 as shown in fig 14 the lubricating effect mentioned earlier is apparent in this study but to a lesser extent due to the increased tortuosity of the domain in comparison to the layered flow investigation a higher viscosity ratio leads to larger and smaller relative permeability values for the nw and w fluids respectively the w phase relative permeability curve is less affected by the change in the viscosity ratio this is explained by the fact that the w fluid flows in layers along the pore walls and in the smaller pore spaces thus improving the flow of the nw fluid through the center of the larger pores dullien 2012 the lubricating effect is proportional to m and is more prominent in systems with smaller pores and larger viscosity ratios li et al 2005 as shown in fig 14 the lubricating effect is very significant at intermediate saturations in the previous study of li et al 2005 it was found that the relative permeability of the w fluid is not heavily affected by the viscosity ratio however this is due to the fact that the viscosity ratio in that study was altered by varying only the viscosity of the nw fluid in our study the viscosity ratio is varied by changing the viscosity of both the w and nw fluids which explains why we observe changes in the relative permeability values of the w fluid these relative permeability trends can be further explained by observing the fluid configurations for the two viscosity ratios studied at sw 0 5 in fig 15 as m is increased it is apparent from the front position that the higher viscosity nw fluid traverses the domain slower bakhshian et al 2019 the lower viscosity w fluid is entrapped against the walls of the porous medium domain which decelerates the flow of the w fluid and results in the lower relative permeability values observed as a result the larger relative permeability values of the more viscous nw fluid are due to two effects the improved connectivity of the nw fluid and the better coating of the solid walls by the w fluid which enhances the lubricating effect on the nw fluid 3 2 3 effect of homogeneous wettability in order to test the effect of a homogeneous wettability distribution on the flow behavior and relative permeability curves of oil and water we conduct a series of simulations where the wettability of the porous medium is set to be strongly oil wetting θ 160 neutral wetting θ 90 or strongly water wetting θ 20 in order to focus on the effect of wettability the simulations are performed under a constant ca number c a 6 5 10 4 and constant initial fluid saturations and configurations the relative permeability curves of the oil and water phase as a function of the wettability conditions investigated are presented in fig 16 the initial saturation of the fluid pair has a major effect on the relative permeability of both phases we observe increasing relative permeability for the two phases with increasing phase saturation beyond a critical saturation but to varying extents depending on the wettability of the sample this is due to the greater phase connectivity brought about by increasing the fluid saturation as the wettability state of the domain is varied from an oil wetting to a water wetting condition the relative permeability of the oil phase increases and the water phase decreases across the whole saturation range in strongly wetting conditions there is an increase in the fluid solid interfacial area for the w fluid which results in a decrease in the relative permeability and vice versa for the nw fluid li et al 2018 as the medium becomes more wetting the w fluid flows through wetting layers and becomes increasingly confined to the narrower regions of the pore space thus allowing the nw phase to flow with a higher conductance through the wider regions of the pore space blunt 2017 in addition the cross over saturation in a wetting system occurs beyond a wetting fluid saturation of 0 5 donaldson and thomas 1971 as shown in fig 16 the cross over saturation in the oil wetting condition occurs at so 0 5 and the cross over saturation in the water wetting case occurs at so 0 5 or sw 0 5 this is consistent with a wetting system where the relative permeability of the nw phase is equal to that of the w phase when the saturation of the nw phase is lower than the saturation of the w phase as mentioned earlier this is a result of the greater resistance to flow experienced by the w phase due to the stronger interactions between the w fluid and the solid walls as explained in the observations and reported in li et al 2005 the effect of wettability on the relative permeability behavior of the fluid pair is a balance between the enhancements to flow due to higher phase connectivity and the resistances due to larger fluid solid interfacial areas however our observations of the relative permeability curves at neutral wetting conditions highlight the complex nature of intermediate wetting systems as the wetting state is varied from an oil wetting condition to a neutral wetting condition the relative permeability of the oil phase increases as expected because it is no longer confined to flow strictly in the narrow regions along the surfaces of the domain however a lower extent of reduction in the water relative permeability was observed as the wettability state was changed from an oil wetting to a neutral wetting condition it seems that changes in the w phase relative permeability are influenced by wettability and the flow is enhanced by relaxing the wetting condition on the other hand the pore morphology is such that no significant reductions in the relative permeability of the nw phase occur as we transition from a strong wetting to a neutral wetting condition except at higher saturations of the nw phase only once the wettability of the sample has been transformed such that the nw phase is now the w phase do we begin to observe significant reductions in the phase relative permeability in the high porosity domain being investigated in order to better illustrate the effects of wettability on phase connectivity and flow behavior the fluid configurations at the same time step are presented in fig 17 for the three wettability states investigated as demonstrated by increasing the strength of one fluid s affinity to the solid surface improved phase connectivity is observed for the w fluid which flows in layers adjacent to the solid surfaces thereby allowing the nw fluid to flow through the center of the pores as a result the w fluid is found in the tighter regions of the pore space adjacent to a solid surface thus leaving large amounts of the nw fluid in the wider regions of the pore space therefore as the domain becomes more wetting lower relative permeability values for the w phase are expected due to the resistance to the flow caused by the adjacent solid surfaces in comparison to the nw phase which flows more easily through the larger portions of the pore space anderson 1987 li et al 2005 as the wettability is varied to a neutral wetting condition the flow behavior becomes more complicated and we observe a combination of concave and convex interfaces the two components equally wet the surface and the relative permeability values are dependent on the interaction between pore geometry and wettability in intermediate wet conditions the interface curvature is a function of the pore geometry and the angularity of the pores as shown in rabbani et al 2018 consequently under intermediate wet conditions the co existence of concave and convex interfaces signifies the simultaneous occurrence of imbibition and drainage in various regions of the pore space rabbani et al 2017 bakhshian et al 2020 by comparing the nw fluid configurations presented in fig 17 green component in neutral and oil wetting conditions we can see that the nw phase maintains a similar degree of connectivity in both situations as a consequence of the pore geometry as a result the nw phase relative permeability becomes a stronger function of the phase connectivity and less dependent on the wettability condition due to the large porosity of the sample which allows the nw phase to be located in the larger pore spaces even under neutral wet conditions as a result the reason for the smaller changes in the nw phase relative permeability after wettability alteration is the effect of phase connectivity as a result of pore morphology and the smaller fluid solid interfacial area once the originally nw phase begins to wet the surface water in a water wetting domain we observe a reduction in the relative permeability at all saturations as expected these observations highlight the importance of accurately capturing both the domain and wettability heterogeneity in a porous medium sample due to their combined influence on the pore scale fluid displacement mechanisms in the next section the effect of a heterogeneous wettability condition will be investigated in order to further analyze the factors contributing to wettability heterogeneity 3 3 heterogeneous wettability although it is algorithmically simple and appealing to assume that the wettability distribution is uniform across the whole domain this is not representative of the true nature of wettability in real reservoir systems in fact most reservoirs display mixed wettability characteristics and moreover the wettability altered fractions of the reservoir cannot be expected to have uniform wetting characteristics therefore in this section the effect of heterogeneous wettability is investigated by generating domains with increasing wettability altered fractions 25 50 75 100 the wettability heterogeneity is generated by randomly assigning locations where wettability is altered and performing different equal sized perturbations in all directions such that bounded regions of wettability altered locations with various sizes are created until the wettability altered fraction threshold is reached assuming an initially water wet domain the fractions altered are wetting with respect to oil thus resembling a drainage process where oil displaces an initially water wet medium the simulations are performed for a constant ca number c a 6 5 x 10 4 and under constant initial fluid saturations and configurations in the following sections the effects of the wettability altered fraction the degree of wettability alteration and the spatially varying contact angle assignment on the flow behavior are investigated 3 3 1 effect of fraction altered in order to test and demonstrate the importance of wettability alteration and specifically the effect of varying the wettability altered fraction in the domain the following sets of simulations are carried out the relative permeability curves and the fluid distributions are obtained for a fully water wet domain θ 20 three domains of increasing wettability altered fractions with respect to oil 25 50 and 75 and a fully oil wet domain θ 160 it should be noted however that in the intermediate domains with fractional wettability alteration the portions of the domain that have not undergone wettability alteration remain strongly wetting with respect to water for example in the 25 wettability altered domain the wettability state of 25 of the total solid surface area is altered to become strongly oil wetting θ 160 while the remaining 75 remains strongly wetting with respect to water θ 20 we conduct the investigations on the 401 401 lu 2 and 788 788 lu 2 domains to ensure that our observations are a consequence of wettability alteration and not artifacts of the domain size used the relative permeability curves obtained for the two subset domains investigated with the different wettability altered fractions are presented in figs 18 and 19 similar trends are observed in the relative permeability curves for the two domains investigated however the extent of the differences are more pronounced in the smaller domain due to its higher porosity and lower tortuosity as the evolution from a completely water wetting domain 0 to an oil wetting domain 100 occurs the relative permeability of water and oil increase and decrease respectively for all saturation values this occurs because water transitions from being the w fluid to the nw fluid and the opposite occurs for oil where the w fluid resides on the solid surface and flows in the narrower regions of the pore space while the nw fluid flows in the wider regions of the pore space a closer observation of kro at low oil saturations so shows that it declines sharply in the 0 case indicating water wet conditions very low water relative permeability at low water saturations high so with a sharp rise at high water saturations is indicative of mixed wet oil wet conditions although we expect the fractional wettability curves to be located between the two completely wetting cases this is only partially observed this trend is observed for so 0 5 and sw 0 8 generally speaking at high saturations of each fluid the relative permeability trend with the fractional values located between the two completely wetting cases is observed in other words once the saturations are high enough to overcome any microscale effects occurring due to initial saturation or wettability distributions the relative permeability curves conform to the expected behavior due to improved phase connectivity however at low and intermediate saturations of each fluid the resistance to flow in the fractional wettability domains does not necessarily follow a pattern as we increment the portion of the domain being wetted therefore situations can arise where the resistance to flow to the oil phase in a fractionally wetting domain with respect to oil is greater than in a completely oil wetting domain zhao et al 2018 for example oil relative permeability values in a domain that is fractionally wetting with respect to oil 25 50 are lower than those in a completely oil wetting domain 100 for so 0 5 as shown in the oil relative permeability curves in fig 19 similarly water relative permeability values in a domain that is fractionally wetting with respect to water are lower than those in a completely water wetting domain 0 for sw 0 8 as shown in the water relative permeability curves in fig 19 our results demonstrate very similar characteristics to those reported in zhao et al 2018 and hwang et al 2006 especially for the higher tortuosity domain an alternative approach to determining and quantifying the restrictions to flow of a fluid system comprised of two phases is a plot of the sum of the relative permeability of the two phases k r o k r w in these plots the lower the sum of the relative permeability of the two phases the larger the resistance to flow the plot of the relative permeability sum as a function of increasing oil saturation for the domains investigated is presented in fig 20 our results are consistent with what has been reported in zhao et al 2018 at high oil saturations so 0 85 the resistance to flow is highest in the completely oil wetting domain 100 and lowest in the completely water wetting domain 0 with the resistance to flow in the fractional wettability domains occurring in order between the two extremes similarly for higher water saturations so 0 15 a similar phenomenon is observed where the resistance to flow is highest in the completely water wetting domain 0 and lowest in the completely oil wetting domain 100 and the fractional wettability curves are located between them however as we approach intermediate saturation values we observe in the fractional wettability domains a larger resistance to flow than in the completely wetting domains in the form of lower relative permeability sums an analysis of the pore scale flow details is needed in order to justify the macroscale relative permeability behavior observed the wettability distributions assigned in addition to the fluid configurations at equivalent time steps for the fractional wettability alteration test are presented in fig 21 as we transition from a strongly water wet domain to a strongly oil wet domain increasing fractions of the domain undergo wettability alteration from water wet to oil wet represented by the yellow surfaces since oil is the nw phase in the water wet domain it flows in the form of ganglia of varying sizes through the center of the large pores surrounded by the w phase in samples with a larger fraction of wettability alteration the oil phase now the w phase with respect to the portion of the domain that has undergone wettability alteration becomes increasingly connected and attached to the wettability altered surfaces the oil phase now begins to incrementally flow in layers along the wettability altered portions of the domain while still retaining some of the nw phase flow features in the portions of the domain that have not undergone wettability alteration finally in the strongly oil wetting domain the oil phase has now completely transitioned from the nw phase to the w phase and flows in thin connected layers along the solid surfaces as the fraction of oil wetting regions increases we observe an increasing amount of entrapped oil clusters controlled primarily by the wettability distribution and the pore morphology in the fractionally altered domains the oil phase displays random distributions and forms more tortuous flow paths than in the completely wetting domains as a consequence of the wettability alteration that has occurred moreover we also confirm the presence of both concave and convex interfaces in the fractionally altered domains which have implications on the pore scale flow mechanisms as has been observed in bakhshian and hosseini 2019 and rabbani et al 2017 the more tortuous flow paths especially at intermediate saturations provide insight into the larger resistance to flow observed in the domains that have undergone fractional wettability alteration in comparison to the completely wetting domains as a result this demonstrates the importance of accurately determining the locations where wettability alteration occurs since it has a significant effect on the general flow behavior of the system and the resulting pore scale and macroscale flow properties 3 3 2 effect of degree of alteration in a real flow system the degree of wettability alteration is largely dependent on the time duration of the wettability alteration process as a result the portions of the domain that undergo wettability alteration will not necessarily transform from being water wet to oil wet and vice versa furthermore we expect to observe a distribution of contact angles after wettability alteration where the new wetting state of the wettability altered domains is proportional to the time that specific region interacted with wettability altering agents in this section in order to isolate the effect of the degree of wettability alteration the portions of the domain that have undergone wettability alteration will instead demonstrate a neutral wetting θ 90 preference in comparison to the oil wetting θ 160 preference from the previous section the portions that have not undergone wettability alteration will remain water wet θ 20 for example in the 25 fractionally altered domain 75 of the domain remains strongly water wet whereas 25 of the domain displays neutral wetting characteristics in the 100 domain the whole domain is modeled to have undergone wettability alteration and displays neutral wetting characteristics with respect to both fluids the relative permeability curves are obtained and compared to those obtained in the previous section in order to test the effect of the degree of wettability alteration the investigations are conducted on the 401 401 lu 2 and 788 788 lu 2 domains and the relative permeability curves are shown in figs 22 and 23 the oil phase demonstrates expected behavior by altering the wetting property of the wettability altered regions from a strong oil wetting condition to a neutral wetting condition the relative permeability of the oil phase increases as expected as shown in figs 22 and 23 due to the decreased fluid solid interfacial area and the lower likelihood of flowing in the narrower regions of the pore space however what is more important to note is that the extent of the variation in the relative permeability curves is also dependent on the fraction of the domain undergoing wettability alteration as the wettability altered fraction increases the variation in the oil relative permeability increases the more interesting observations are those associated with the behavior of the water phase the nw phase with respect to the wettability altered regions since the water phase strongly wets a portion of the domain we do not observe significant changes in the relative permeability curves as shown in fig 22 moreover the high porosity nature of the domain means that there exists a significant amount of large pore spaces which the nw phase occupies therefore the flow behavior of the nw phase in a large porosity domain becomes less dependent on the solid fluid interfacial area and consequently the wettability alteration in the higher tortuosity domain 788 788 lu 2 we do not observe significant variations in the water relative permeability curves for the domains that are predominantly wetting with respect to water i e the 25 domain that is 75 strongly wetting with respect to water and the 50 domain that is 50 strongly wetting with respect to water the mobility of the water phase is still dictated by the portions of the domain that have not undergone wettability alteration water wet regions however in the 75 domain that is only 25 strongly wetting with respect to water wettability alteration effects at a significant portion of the domain begin to overcome the effects of the smaller wetting portion of the domain and we begin to observe variations in the water relative permeability curves as a result we conclude that the flow pattern of the water phase and the resulting relative permeability curves in high porosity domains that are becoming less water wetting are dominated by the large pore spaces and the regions that remain strongly water wetting and become affected by the portions of the domain that have undergone wettability alteration once a significant percentage of the domain has undergone wettability alteration in addition it was also observed that a neutral wetting condition improved the mobility of both phases in the 788 788lu 2 but only the oil phase in the 401 401 lu 2 a similar discrepancy has been previously reported in the literature landry et al 2014 li et al 2005 which can be attributed to the competition between the improved mobility of the nw phase due to a smaller fluid solid interfacial area and the reduced mobility due to a decrease in connectivity in addition as mentioned earlier the co existence of concave and convex interfaces in neutral wetting conditions is heavily influenced by the pore geometry and angularity and influences the pore scale displacement mechanisms governing the flow and the mobility of the phases rabbani et al 2017 2018 bakhshian et al 2020 rabbani et al 2016 in summary for an initially water saturated porous medium as increasing portions of the domain undergo varying degrees of wettability alteration towards an intermediate or oil wetting condition the mobility of the oil phase is sensitive to the degree of wettability alteration and the difference is proportional to the fraction altered on the other hand the mobility of the water phase in a high porosity domain which continues to strongly wet the unaltered portions of the domain is less sensitive to the degree of alteration until a significant portion of the domain has undergone wettability alteration which also indicates that the degree of alteration effects are proportional to the fraction altered the observations in this section demonstrate the correlations between the wettability altered fraction the pore geometry and the degree of wettability alteration and highlight the need to constantly assess this for realistic predictions in a porous medium sample a heterogeneous wettability investigation was conducted in landry et al 2014 by altering the wettability of the nodes in contact with the nw phase at the end of homogeneous wet simulations for s w 0 5 the wettability of the nodes was altered to preferentially wet the nw phase and a number of mixed wet states was created the authors observed a significant reduction in the nw phase relative permeability since portions of the domain were altered to become wetting with respect to the originally nw phase moreover it was determined that the degree of wettability alteration also impacted the extent of the relative permeability variation of the originally nw phase this is consistent with what we observed in section 3 3 1 and section 3 3 2 as larger portions of an initially water wetting domain were altered to become oil wetting we observed a reduction in the oil relative permeability and a dependency on the fraction of the domain undergoing wettability alteration as shown in figs 18 and 19 this was also confirmed in hwang et al 2006 where an experimental study on the effects of fractional wettability on capillary pressure and relative permeability relations was conducted however we also observed at low oil saturations lower oil phase relative permeability in a domain with fractional wettability than in a completely oil wetting domain as has been reported in zhao et al 2018 where oil water two phase flow was simulated in domains of increasing oil wetting fractions and the relative permeability was computed additionally in section 3 3 2 we saw a dependence in the oil phase relative permeability on the degree of wettability alteration in landry et al 2014 wettability alteration was implemented for a specific initial saturation and only one specific case of fractional wettability alteration was studied therefore we also added an additional observation that the dependency of the oil phase relative permeability on the degree of wettability alteration increases when a larger fraction of the domain has undergone wettability alteration in an originally water wet system as shown in figs 22 and 23 in terms of the water phase initially w phase in a water wetting domain it was reported in landry et al 2014 that the w phase water in our simulations was insensitive to wettability alteration this was observed because wettability was unaltered at the locations in contact with the w phase and the relative permeability of the w phase was dependent on the established flow paths since we alter the wettability randomly at increasing portions of the domain in section 3 3 1 we eventually observe an increase in the water phase relative permeability in addition we also observe lower water phase relative permeability at certain saturations in a domain with fractional wettability than in a water wetting domain as shown in figs 18 and 19 and observed in zhao et al 2018 moreover we confirm that the water phase relative permeability is less sensitive to the degree of wettability alteration for lower wettability altered fractions and we conclude that the flow of the water phase remains controlled by the unaltered portions of the domain water wetting potions and is not severely impacted by the fluid solid interfacial area in a high porosity domain until a significant fraction of the domain has undergone wettability alteration by conducting simulations in a more tortuous pore space 788 788 lu 2 we observe a dependency between the extent of change in the water phase relative permeability due to the degree of wettability alteration and the fraction of the domain undergoing wettability alteration as larger portions of the domain undergo wettability alteration the water phase relative permeability becomes more sensitive to the degree of wettability alteration at the portion of the domain that is not water wetting as shown in fig 23 these observations shed insight into the complex nature of mixed wet flows and the conflicting observations in the literature with regards to flow ability and residual trapping in mixed wet systems as a consequence of the strong dependence between wettability and pore geometry and highlight the need for additional investigations 3 3 3 effect of contact angle assignment as mentioned earlier once wettability alteration has occurred the wetting state in the domain and even more specifically in a pore can vary as a result in this section we investigate the effect of assigning a non uniform contact angle distribution by comparing the results with those obtained earlier when a constant contact angle was assigned in the first investigation a conservative distribution of contact angles is investigated that distribution will be expanded in the second investigation for all of the domains that have undergone wettability alteration the two wettability states investigated are neutral wetting and strong wetting for the neutral wetting case the constant contact angle assignment is performed by assigning a θ 90 contact angle while the non uniform assignment is done by randomly assigning contact angles from the following gaussian distribution θ 90 15 similarly in the strong wetting case the constant contact angle assignment is performed by assigning a θ 160 contact angle while the non uniform assignment is done by randomly assigning contact angles from the following gaussian distribution θ 155 15 the resulting relative permeability curves are presented in fig 24 and we observe very minor differences between the constant and non uniform contact angle assignment however this is attributed to the very narrow distribution of contact angles assigned furthermore similar to what has been observed in the degree of alteration test the extent of the variation in the relative permeability curves also is dependent on the fraction of the domain undergoing wettability alteration although the differences are minor the variation in the relative permeability increases as the wettability altered fraction increases in a real and more heterogeneous porous media system where the fluids in place reside for a very long time and in larger volumes a larger contact angle distribution usually exists for example in alratrout et al 2017 an automatic algorithm which measures the contact angle between immiscible fluids directly on pore scale x ray images was developed the algorithm was validated and then implemented on a ketton sample for both a water wet and a wettability altered system in the initial water wet system the sample showed a gaussian distribution with a mean contact angle equal to 71 and a narrow standard deviation of 12 in the altered wettability system the contact angles were more widely spread with a mean contact angle equal to 90 and a standard deviation of 26 similarly in alhammadi et al 2017 three wettability aging protocols were performed on three samples from the same carbonate core plug as a result three different wettability states were obtained with the following distributions 77 21 weakly water wet system 104 26 mixed wet system and 94 24 mixed wet system in order to test the wider contact angle distribution the following investigations are conducted for the neutral and strong wetting cases the contact angle distributions are 90 45 and 35 25 the new and old contact angle distributions are tested on the originally water wet 0 and oil wet 100 domains in order for the results to be comparable the resulting relative permeability curves are presented in fig 25 by comparing the relative permeability curves obtained when a narrow and wide contact angle distribution is assigned we observe that the differences in the relative permeability curves do indeed increase but not significantly for the neutral wetting case the distribution is centered at the same value used in the constant contact angle assignment 90 and therefore the difference is less than that observed in the strong wetting case where the distribution is centered at a different value than that used in the constant contact angle assignment this is also attributed to the pore geometry effect where the nw phase relative permeability in the domain studied is strongly correlated with phase connectivity and the smaller fluid solid interfacial area as a result in the context of a spatial contact angle assignment the importance of capturing the specific contact angle in every pore is dependent on the pore geometry in addition to the contact angle distribution and the severity of the standard deviations for example in a tortuous sample where a very wide distribution of contact angles with a large standard deviation is observed it is recommended to capture the spatial variation in the contact angles 4 conclusions and future work in this work the scmc lbm model was able to simulate the expected trends for multiphase flow in porous media under varying capillary numbers viscosity ratios and homogeneous wettability conditions it was also utilized to isolate and analyze the different factors that contribute to wettability heterogeneity the effect of the fraction of the domain undergoing wettability alteration the degree of wettability alteration at the wettability altered pores and the assignment of a spatially varying contact angle distribution were investigated in order to determine their relative importance in order to conduct the investigation we generated domains of increasing fractions of wettability altered pores from a completely water wet domain to an oil wet domain the main conclusions drawn from this study are the effect of wettability on the relative permeability behavior and the fluid configurations observed acts through two opposing mechanisms enhancement and resistance to flow due to increased connectivity and larger fluid solid interfacial areas respectively in a fractional wettability system the same two mechanisms are present but to varying extents depending on the amount of pores that have undergone wettability alteration the extent of the wettability alteration and the variance in the contact angle assignment we observe that a larger resistance to the overall flow and more tortuous flow paths specifically at comparable saturations of the two fluids exist in a domain that has undergone wettability alteration in comparison to a completely water oil wet domain as we fractionally transition from a water wet to an oil wet domain the degree of wettability alteration becomes more important with the increasing fractions and its effect more prominent on the flow behavior and relative permeability curves of the oil phase on the other hand the flow of the water phase in a high porosity domain remains dictated by the large pore spaces and the regions of the domain that have not undergone wettability alteration water wet until a significant portion of the domain undergoes wettability alteration the accurate spatial contact angle assignment also demonstrates a dependence on the fraction altered and becomes more important for domains that display large deviations in the contact angle values we find that the relative permeability and the flow behavior in the context of wettability alteration are influenced primarily by the fraction of the pores undergoing wettability alteration after primary drainage followed by the degree of alteration and the contact angle assignment which are also dependent on the wettability altered fraction the interactions between pore morphology and wettability heterogeneity especially under neutral wetting conditions strongly influence the pore scale displacement mechanisms and highlight the importance of lattice boltzmann simulations which easily incorporate domain and wettability heterogeneity the observations in this study demonstrate the intricate interplay and co dependence of many factors when studying wettability alteration and enhance the argument for an all encompassing algorithm which can correctly capture the time dependent wettability state of every pore in order to better understand the relationship between domain and wettability heterogeneity and the resulting pore scale flow mechanisms that will be

387,multiphase flow in porous media is found in a variety of engineering problems including in technologies focused on satisfying the energy needs of an expanding global population while minimizing the effects of human activity on climate change the objective of this study is to provide a better understanding of the importance and interdependence of the wettability altered fraction the degree of wettability alteration and the spatially varying contact angle assignment in influencing the pore scale and macroscale flow properties in order to conduct this investigation and analyze the effects on the relative permeability curves and fluid configurations the shan chen multi relaxation time multicomponent lattice boltzmann model with explicit forcing is utilized and domains of increasing fractions of wettability altered pores are generated we find that the fraction altered the degree of alteration and the accurate contact angle assignment are all correlated and play a role to varying extents in influencing the flow behavior and the resulting relative permeability curves the fraction altered displays the strongest effect and the effects of the degree of alteration and contact angle assignment become more significant when a larger fraction of the sample has undergone wettability alteration a sample that has undergone fractional wettability alteration results in a larger resistance to the overall flow and more tortuous flow paths at intermediate saturations in comparison to a strongly water oil wetting domain in a high porosity domain that is becoming increasingly oil wet the degree of wettability alteration has a more pronounced effect on the flow behavior of the oil phase whereas the flow of the water phase remains dictated by the large pore spaces and the regions of the domain that have not undergone wettability alteration until a significant fraction of the domain has been altered moreover a spatially varying contact angle assignment becomes more important for a system with a large distribution of contact angles the results demonstrate the correlations between wettability alteration and pore geometry and highlight the need for an algorithm that captures the true time dependent wettability state of a porous medium sample keywords relative permeability wettability alteration porous media multiphase flow lattice boltzmann method mrt 1 introduction many of the pressing challenges of the twenty first century are dictated by the physics of multiphase flow in porous media these challenges include but are not limited to providing an uninterrupted energy supply and access to clean water for a rapidly growing global population while mitigating the harmful environmental impacts of human activity on climate change a substantial portion of the world s current energy sources are located in porous underground reservoirs in the form of hydrocarbons moreover carbon capture and sequestration ccs which involves capturing and injecting carbon dioxide in porous underground reservoirs is an increasingly implemented method which aims to minimize these emissions and thus reduce the effects of human activity on climate change many other scientific and engineering applications such as fuel cells contaminant transport and membranes for desalination are governed by the principles of flow in porous media hence it is of paramount importance to continue to enhance our understanding of the relevant physical phenomena associated with flow in porous media blunt 2017 the relative permeability of a porous medium is a measure of the sample s ability to conduct one fluid in the presence of one or more other fluids anderson 1987 the relative permeability curves are a function of many parameters such as the pore geometry topology capillary number viscosity ratio saturation history and wettability warner 2015 zhao et al 2017 the wettability of a porous medium can be defined as the competition between multiple immiscible fluids to adhere on the medium s solid surface and plays an important role in influencing multiphase flow in porous media warner 2015 wettability at the pore scale is typically defined using the contact angle which is the angle that the fluid fluid interface forms with the solid surface zhao et al 2018 o carroll et al 2005 a fluid is said to preferentially wet the surface if the contact angle it forms is less than 90 wettability is a significant parameter that controls the pore scale flow behavior and the resulting macroscale multiphase properties such as relative permeability and capillary pressure murison et al 2014 bakhshian and hosseini 2019 for example in cieplak and robbins 1990 the impact of wettability on the capillary displacement in a two dimensional porous media was investigated by varying the contact angle of the invading fluid in the non wetting limit the fluid invasion pattern was consistent with percolation and the growth of the invading cluster occurred in bursts as the domain became more wetting to the invading fluid growth mechanisms became dominated by overlaps and touches and the finger width in the invasion pattern increased until a divergence of the finger width was observed at a critical contact angle below the critical contact angle a transition from percolation to a uniform flood occurred additionally in zhao et al 2016 the effect of wettability on viscously unfavorable fluid fluid displacement was analyzed and it was shown that increasing the wettability of the domain with respect to the invading fluid improved the efficiency of the defending fluid displacement due to cooperative pore filling until a critical wetting transition was reached and the trend was reversed wettability has also been investigated in the context of residual trapping it has been demonstrated that the wettability distribution strongly impacts capillary trapping with conflicting recommendations about the optimal wettability condition in order to suppress or improve residual trapping chaudhary et al 2013 rahman et al 2016 herring et al 2016 wang et al 2016 the wettability distribution of a porous medium sample can either be homogeneous or heterogeneous for the homogeneous case the various fluids have a uniform wetting preference throughout the whole sample most previous studies have investigated multiphase flow in systems with homogeneous wettability distributions despite the significant impact of wettability heterogeneity on relative permeability capillary pressure and recovery efficiency bakhshian and hosseini 2019 masalmeh 2003 in many of the systems of interest and for example in a drainage process where oil displaces an initially water saturated porous medium wettability alteration typically occurs due to polar interactions between the oil and the solid surface buckley and liu 1998 a similar phenomenon occurs in contaminant transport where non aqueous phase liquid napl additives adsorb onto the solid surface harrold et al 2001 as a result a heterogeneous wettability distribution mixed wet system is typically encountered in these systems and providing a better understanding of its effect on both the pore scale and macroscale flow properties is an important task 1 1 background an understanding of the microscopic physics serves as a prelude towards determining the macroscopic transport properties of flow in porous media however characterizing and predicting the pore scale physics in porous media involves many challenges the most prominent challenge stems from the heterogeneous complicated and system dependent topology of porous media armstrong et al 2016 in these geological systems the size of the highly heterogeneous pores where the fluids reside is on the order of micrometers dullien 2012 therefore typical macroscale darcy s law based models which neglect the pore scale flow details fail to effectively capture many commonly observed physical phenomena such as hysteresis capillary trapping and haines jump schlüter et al 2016 andrew et al 2015 berg et al 2013 2016 as a result in order to improve our understanding of the microscale fundamental mechanisms that result in the macroscale natural processes correctly capturing and simulating the pore scale physical behavior in these systems is necessary the continuing advancements in computational tools and the development of image processing methods have enabled numerical models to become an attractive solution to quickly and cost efficiently simulate and understand the pore scale physics in porous media zhao et al 2019 several numerical methods have been proposed in order to investigate multiphase flow within porous media these methods include the lattice boltzmann method lbm boek and venturoli 2010 ramstad et al 2012 pore scale network modeling pnm blunt and king 1991 blunt 2001 and grid based computational fluid dynamics cfd methods such as the volume of fluid vof method raeini et al 2012 rabbani et al 2018 the level set ls method jettestuen et al 2013 and the phase field method cogswell and szulczewski 2017 pore scale network modeling is implemented by constructing a sample network of pores and throats representing the porous medium of interest and simulating the fluid flow on the extracted network xiong et al 2016 oren et al 1998 piri and blunt 2005 the main advantage of pnm is the computational efficiency making the method ideal for use on large samples however the main drawback of this approach is that a medium s heterogeneity is incorporated by making simplifications in the domain representation jiang et al 2007 and therefore the networks do not capture the true pore structure and connectivity of a sample that can be obtained by advanced tomographic imaging golparvar et al 2018 as a result losses in accuracy are expected as the medium complexity increases liu et al 2016 traditional grid based computational fluid dynamics cfd methods solve the navier stokes equations while implementing a technique to track and capture the fluid fluid interface the main difficulties associated with grid based cfd methods are capturing and tracking the dynamic fluid fluid interface for multiphase flows in addition to incorporating fluid solid interfacial effects golparvar et al 2018 liu et al 2016 as an alternative the lbm is a robust and efficient algorithm which can be used to simulate flows in geometrically complex porous media the lbm utilizes particle distribution functions pdfs or simply particles to model a group of fluid molecules succi 2001 and is ideal for use with micro computed tomography micro ct scanned images of porous media thus enabling the precise determination of transport properties in real porous media in addition capturing the interface is not required in the lbm since the interface arises automatically due to phase separation chen and doolen 1998 the lbm also has further advantages such as local computation which increases the method s suitability for parallel implementation and improves its computational efficiency harting et al 2005 as a result the lbm is a strong candidate for investigating and simulating multiphase and multicomponent flows in porous media various multiphase and multicomponent models have been proposed such as the pseudo potential model shan and chen 1993 color gradient model gunstensen et al 1991 free energy model swift et al 1996 and mean field model he et al 1999 the lbm has been gaining in popularity for simulating multiphase flow in porous media on both realistic ramstad et al 2012 tsuji et al 2016 and ideal pore structures sphere packs li et al 2018 liu et al 2015 pore scale lbm simulations investigating the effects of various parameters such as the pore structure capillary number viscosity ratio interfacial tension and wettability on the relative permeability curves have been conducted zhao et al 2018 boek and venturoli 2010 pan et al 2004 martys and chen 1996 zhang et al 2016 ghassemi and pak 2011 hazlett et al 1998 landry et al 2014 dou and zhou 2013 bakhshian et al 2019 however lbm investigations of the impact of mixed wettability systems on relative permeability are more limited for example in the work of hazlett et al 1998 and landry et al 2014 the wettability is altered at the portion of the domain in contact with the non wetting phase at the end of drainage furthermore a sensitivity analysis is conducted to investigate the impact of the degree of wettability alteration for a given initial fluid saturation in landry et al 2014 it was found that the non wetting phase is more sensitive to wettability alteration and displays a decrease in relative permeability whereas minimal changes are observed in the wetting phase relative permeability this is in contrast to the pore network modeling study of gharbi and blunt 2012 which found a significant reduction in both the non wetting and wetting phase relative permeability in a mixed wet limestone an additional investigation was conducted in zhao et al 2018 where the relative permeability curves were obtained for increasing oil wet solid fractions of an initially fully water wet domain similarly the impact of wettability heterogeneity on the pore scale displacement dynamics and the capillary trapping mechanism in a supercritical co 2 brine system was investigated in bakhshian and hosseini 2019 it was found that the heterogeneous wettability distributions have a significant impact on the fluid distributions resulting in more tortuous flow paths and a higher interfacial area between the fluid phases moreover the impact of wettability also extends to the fluid entrapment patterns and the phase connectivity in all of these investigations the wettability is altered to a constant value however in the recent study of akai et al 2019 in situ measured experimental contact angles were incorporated into the simulations and compared against a waterflooding experiment the assignment of a constant and non uniform contact angle was investigated and it was found that the constant contact angle assignment predicted a 54 higher water effective permeability while the spatially varying contact angle assignment resulted in less than 1 relative error the objective of this study is to investigate the relative importance of the wettability altered fraction the portion of the domain undergoing wettability alteration the degree of wettability alteration the extent wettability is varied at the wettability altered fractions and the accurate contact angle assignment and their effects on relative permeability and fluid configurations using the shan chen multicomponent lattice boltzmann method scmc lbm in order to conduct the investigation domains of increasing fractions of wettability altered pores are created and the impacts on relative permeability and fluid configuration are studied by assigning both a uniform and spatially varying contact angle at the wettability altered portion of the domain the goal is to motivate the need for a time dependent wettability alteration algorithm for the lbm in the next section the shan chen multi relaxation time mrt multicomponent lattice boltzmann model is introduced and the steps associated with implementing the model are explained the model is then validated using standard benchmark tests static droplet contact angle and layered flow following that the effects of the capillary number driving force viscosity ratio and varying homogeneous wettability are studied in order to confirm that the model captures the expected trends in relative permeability in the heterogeneous wettability test domains of increasing wettability altered fractions are used and the impacts of the degree of wettability alteration are analyzed using both a constant and a spatially varying contact angle assignment in the final section conclusions are drawn and suggestions for future work are provided 2 methods shan chen multicomponent lattice boltzmann model scmc lbm with explicit forcing in this work we employ the scmc lbm with the mrt collision model wolf gladrow 2004

introduced the scmc lbm model is validated using three standard benchmarks tests the young laplace test the contact angle test and layered flow 3 1 1 the young laplace test the aim of the young laplace validation is to test the model s capability for accurately defining an interfacial tension and forming a sharp interface between the two fluid components moreover it is used to establish a relationship between the fluid fluid interaction parameter g σ σ and the interfacial tension σ for a droplet of one fluid suspended in another fluid at mechanical equilibrium the difference in pressure inside and outside of the droplet δ p should be inversely proportional to the radius of the droplet r the constant of proportionality is the interfacial tension the laplace pressure in 2d is given by 16 δ p σ r a circular droplet of one component is initialized in the center of the other component and the system is allowed to reach steady state in the absence of any external forcing the system is periodic in the x and y directions succi 2001 maier et al 1996 for each viscosity ratio tested five droplets are initialized of initial radii r i 15 20 25 30 50 lu the viscosity ratio of the system is the ratio of the viscosity of the non wetting nw phase to the viscosity of the wetting w phase and is altered by varying the relaxation rates s v σ of each component the simulation domain size is taken to be five times the initial radius in both the x and y directions the steady state criterion is given by eq 17 17 y u y y t u y y t 1 000 2 y u y y t 2 10 5 once steady state is reached the final droplet formed is plotted as shown in fig 1 the pressure difference across the interface and the final radius of the droplet are determined and plotted as shown in fig 2 in all of the simulations described in this paper the wetting and non wetting fluid densities ρσ in lattice units is scaled to 1 0 ρ w ρ n w 1000 k g m 3 the viscosity ratios investigated are m 0 1 1 0 10 and 100 the value of the fluid fluid interaction parameter resulting in a sharp interface between the two fluids is determined and utilized in all of the remaining simulations g σ σ 3 1 the resulting interfacial tension in lattice units is 0 0925 σ 15 m n m the procedure for converting lattice units to physical units involves determining scaling quantities for length l time t and fluid density m zhao et al 2018 liu et al 2015 ramstad et al 2010 due to the diffusive nature of the pseudo potential model li et al 2018 shan and doolen 1996 both wetting and non wetting phases coexist at each fluid node for example at a fluid node where the w phase density is much larger than the nw phase density the minor phase nw phase can be considered to be dissolved in the major phase therefore the minor phase has a finite and negligible density at fluid nodes with a much larger major phase density typically major to minor phase density vary by over 3 4 orders of magnitude so that the presence of the minor phase can be assumed to be negligible as observed in fig 2 the model indeed satisfies laplace s law and as expected a linear function relating the pressure difference and the radius of the droplet is obtained furthermore the interfacial tension is a function of the fluid fluid interaction parameter only g σ σ and roughly independent of the viscosity ratio of the fluids 3 1 2 contact angle test a contact angle test is conducted in order to test the wetting boundary condition introduced earlier and to obtain the resulting contact angles under different values of the fluid solid interaction parameter gσs a semicircular droplet of one component is initialized at the center of the channel wall surrounded by the second component the domain used is 125 127 lu 2 and the bounce back boundary condition no slip zero velocity he and luo 1997 is implemented at the channel walls while the periodic boundary condition is implemented at the inlet and outlet of the domain similar to the young laplace test the system is allowed to reach steady state in the absence of any external forcing once the interfacial tension value is set by g σ σ the value of gσs is varied and the resulting contact angle measured in fig 3 a sample droplet is shown for a weak wetting case for different values of gσs the resulting contact angles are plotted in fig 4 a linear fit of the contact angle data is used in order to obtain a relationship between gσs and θ for the given interfacial tension value θ 157 26 g σ s 91 731 this relationship can prove useful when simulating a domain with heterogeneous wettability 3 1 3 layered flow for the final validation test the layered flow problem is chosen since it tests the model s capability of obtaining accurate velocity profiles and as a result relative permeability curves for different viscosity ratios under varying saturations of the two fluids in the layered flow problem the nw fluid is initialized in the center of the domain while the w fluid flows along the boundary as shown in fig 5 periodic boundary conditions are implemented at the inlet outlet ends of the domain while the bounce back boundary condition is utilized along the solid walls an external body force is used to drive the flow f b 1 10 6 in the x direction the simulation domain is 20 201 lu 2 the analytical velocity profile and the resulting relative permeability curves are obtained using the following equations zhao et al 2018 kang et al 2004 huang and lu 2009 ba et al 2016 18 u x n w a 1 y 2 c 1 0 y a 19 u x w a 2 y 2 b 2 y c 2 a y b where u x nw and u x w are the velocities of the non wetting and wetting fluids in the x direction the parameters are computed as follows a 1 f b 2 ρ n w v n w a 2 f b 2 ρ w v w b 2 2 a 2 a 2 m a 1 a c 1 a 2 a 1 a 2 b 2 b a a 2 b 2 and c 2 a 2 b 2 b 2 b where vnw and vw are the kinematic viscosities of the non wetting and wetting fluids and m μ n w μ w is the dynamic viscosity ratio in figs 6 and 7 we demonstrate the model s capability of handling a wide range of viscosity ratios as shown an excellent fit between the simulated and analytical velocity profiles is observed however the more important validations associated with the layered flow problem for the application of flow in porous media are the relative permeability curves obtained we focus on a viscosity ratio equal to 10 and conduct the simulation for varying initial values of the w fluid saturation the velocity profiles are obtained and the relative permeability curves are generated from the integration of the velocity profiles using eqs 20 and 21 20 k r w s w y a l u w d y y 0 l u w d y 21 k r n w s w y 0 a u n w d y y 0 l u n w d y the theoretical relative permeability curves are a function of the viscosity ratio and initial fluid saturation as shown in eqs 22 and 23 yiotis et al 2007 22 k r w 1 2 s w 2 3 s w 23 k r n w s n w 3 2 m s n w 2 1 3 2 m where s n w a b is the saturation of the non wetting phase and s w 1 a b is the saturation of the wetting phase similarly an excellent agreement is observed between the theoretical and computed relative permeability values as shown in fig 8 for the w fluid at lower saturations we observe very thin layers which flow very slowly which in turn explains the low relative permeability as the saturation is further increased the relative permeability value approaches the absolute permeability k r 1 as if the w fluid is the only fluid in the system and experiences no impediment to flow due to the presence of the nw fluid for the nw fluid we observe more interesting results where the relative permeability values are greater than one this is due to the lubricating effect that the w fluid provides to the nw fluid since the nw fluid is confined to the center of the domain the w fluid flows in layers adjacent to the solid boundaries and enhances the movement of the nw fluid through the center of the channel for all intermediate saturation values blunt 2017 3 2 relative permeability of a sphere pack in order to conduct more representative simulations the remaining simulations are performed on the sphere pack slice shown in fig 9 obtained from the digital rocks portal finney 2016 the sphere pack image is obtained by x ray microtomography with a resolution of 5 7μm and the porosity of the sphere pack sample is 0 3421 the pore size distribution of the sample is presented in fig 10 rabbani et al 2014 the density and viscosity ratios are both set to unity for all the remaining simulations except for when the effect of the viscosity ratio is studied which is adequate for approximating a water napl system in a capillary force dominated regime where the density and viscosity of the two components are of the same order of magnitude li et al 2018 the interfacial tension is 15 m n m periodic boundary conditions are implemented in the x and y directions and the fluids are initialized according to li et al 2018 as shown in fig 11 the width of the wetting non wetting fluid regions are varied in order to adjust the saturations the procedure for determining the final fluid saturations and the resulting relative permeability is obtained from li et al 2018 in the following three sections we focus on the effect of the capillary number viscosity ratio and wettability in order to observe whether the model captures the expected trends 3 2 1 effect of capillary number the effect of the capillary ca number i e the ratio of viscous forces to capillary forces is tested by varying the force driving the fluids which is equivalent to changing the pressure gradient three driving forces f b 9 10 6 4 10 5 and 6 10 5 are applied on both the w and nw fluids which are roughly equivalent to capillary numbers of c a 9 7 10 5 4 3 10 4 and 6 5 10 4 the effect of the ca number is tested on a strong wetting domain θ 20 and under the same initial fluid saturations and configurations a strong wetting domain is chosen to simulate a drainage process where oil nw displaces water w in a strong water wetting medium due to the large computational burden of the simulations and the numerous investigations to be conducted we performed the ca number test on the two subset domain sizes shown in fig 12 in order to obtain a representative elementary volume rev capable of capturing the expected trends the simulation domain sizes are 401 401 lu 2 por 0 3924 and 601 601 lu 2 por 0 3439 respectively the porosity of the original sphere pack sample is 0 3426 the relative permeability values are computed across the whole saturation range tested for the three ca numbers investigated and are plotted in fig 12 as observed the two domains are capable of capturing qualitatively similar trends with increasing ca numbers however the trends are more pronounced in the 401 401 lu 2 domain owing to the higher porosity and lower tortuosity of the sample since porosity and permeability do not vary significantly between the subset domain 601 601lu 2 and the original sample 788 788 lu 2 we conclude that the 601 601 lu 2 domain is a suitable rev however since the correct trends are captured using both subset domain sizes we conclude that both domains can be used in order to capture qualitatively the effect of different parameters on relative permeability therefore we will utilize the 601 601 lu 2 subset domain in order to test the effect of the capillary number viscosity ratio and wettability and investigate the model s capability of capturing the expected behavior following that we will investigate the role of heterogeneous wettability on both the 401 401 lu 2 subset domain and the original sphere pack image 788 788lu 2 in order to analyze the effect of pore geometry and obtain results of the highest accuracy as shown in fig 12 the relative permeability values of both the w and nw fluids increase for a higher ca number across the whole saturation range moreover the cross over saturation is greater than 0 5 for both ca numbers which is expected in a wetting system the relative permeability curves generated demonstrate a similar trend with the changing ca number as was observed in li et al 2005 and langaas and papatzacos 2001 the relative permeability curves for both phases increase and approach a straight line as the capillary number is increased towards the viscous limit and the effect of capillary forces is overcome longeron 1980 the relative permeability values of both fluids show a smaller variation with saturation for low saturation values of a specific component with a more abrupt increase in relative permeability as the saturation is increased further beyond the cross over saturation in order to better understand and explain the observed relative permeability curves the fluid distributions at equivalent increasing time steps for the three ca numbers are investigated at sw 0 5 and provided in fig 13 by comparing the fluid distributions at equivalent time steps columns evidence of a faster evolution is observed throughout the domain for a higher ca number as is expected however in order to better understand the pore scale flow details which are resulting in these larger relative permeability values a closer look at the pore scale behavior is needed the nw fluid takes the form of disconnected blobs or ganglion which are trapped either in dead end pores or the larger pores a consequence of the wettability condition capillary forces ensure that the nw fluid remains trapped in these large pores however as the driving force ca number increases evidence of the nw fluid overcoming the entry capillary pressure of tighter pore spaces is evident in fig 13 as a result the connectivity of the nw fluid increases and additional flow paths are created which results in an enhancement of the overall relative permeability of the nw fluid across the whole saturation range huang and lu 2009 shi and tang 2018 the w fluid is found adjacent to the solid surface entrapped in the tighter regions of the pore space due to the wettability condition and demonstrates increasing relative permeability values with a larger driving force 3 2 2 effect of viscosity ratio in the second investigation the effect of the viscosity ratio m is tested the capillary number is set at c a 6 5 10 4 and the wettability of the porous medium is set to a strong wetting condition θ 20 the viscosity ratios simulated are m 1 0 and 10 the fluid saturations and configurations are initialized similar to the ca number investigation in order to ensure consistency of results the relative permeability values are determined for the viscosity ratios investigated and are plotted in fig 14 as shown in fig 14 the lubricating effect mentioned earlier is apparent in this study but to a lesser extent due to the increased tortuosity of the domain in comparison to the layered flow investigation a higher viscosity ratio leads to larger and smaller relative permeability values for the nw and w fluids respectively the w phase relative permeability curve is less affected by the change in the viscosity ratio this is explained by the fact that the w fluid flows in layers along the pore walls and in the smaller pore spaces thus improving the flow of the nw fluid through the center of the larger pores dullien 2012 the lubricating effect is proportional to m and is more prominent in systems with smaller pores and larger viscosity ratios li et al 2005 as shown in fig 14 the lubricating effect is very significant at intermediate saturations in the previous study of li et al 2005 it was found that the relative permeability of the w fluid is not heavily affected by the viscosity ratio however this is due to the fact that the viscosity ratio in that study was altered by varying only the viscosity of the nw fluid in our study the viscosity ratio is varied by changing the viscosity of both the w and nw fluids which explains why we observe changes in the relative permeability values of the w fluid these relative permeability trends can be further explained by observing the fluid configurations for the two viscosity ratios studied at sw 0 5 in fig 15 as m is increased it is apparent from the front position that the higher viscosity nw fluid traverses the domain slower bakhshian et al 2019 the lower viscosity w fluid is entrapped against the walls of the porous medium domain which decelerates the flow of the w fluid and results in the lower relative permeability values observed as a result the larger relative permeability values of the more viscous nw fluid are due to two effects the improved connectivity of the nw fluid and the better coating of the solid walls by the w fluid which enhances the lubricating effect on the nw fluid 3 2 3 effect of homogeneous wettability in order to test the effect of a homogeneous wettability distribution on the flow behavior and relative permeability curves of oil and water we conduct a series of simulations where the wettability of the porous medium is set to be strongly oil wetting θ 160 neutral wetting θ 90 or strongly water wetting θ 20 in order to focus on the effect of wettability the simulations are performed under a constant ca number c a 6 5 10 4 and constant initial fluid saturations and configurations the relative permeability curves of the oil and water phase as a function of the wettability conditions investigated are presented in fig 16 the initial saturation of the fluid pair has a major effect on the relative permeability of both phases we observe increasing relative permeability for the two phases with increasing phase saturation beyond a critical saturation but to varying extents depending on the wettability of the sample this is due to the greater phase connectivity brought about by increasing the fluid saturation as the wettability state of the domain is varied from an oil wetting to a water wetting condition the relative permeability of the oil phase increases and the water phase decreases across the whole saturation range in strongly wetting conditions there is an increase in the fluid solid interfacial area for the w fluid which results in a decrease in the relative permeability and vice versa for the nw fluid li et al 2018 as the medium becomes more wetting the w fluid flows through wetting layers and becomes increasingly confined to the narrower regions of the pore space thus allowing the nw phase to flow with a higher conductance through the wider regions of the pore space blunt 2017 in addition the cross over saturation in a wetting system occurs beyond a wetting fluid saturation of 0 5 donaldson and thomas 1971 as shown in fig 16 the cross over saturation in the oil wetting condition occurs at so 0 5 and the cross over saturation in the water wetting case occurs at so 0 5 or sw 0 5 this is consistent with a wetting system where the relative permeability of the nw phase is equal to that of the w phase when the saturation of the nw phase is lower than the saturation of the w phase as mentioned earlier this is a result of the greater resistance to flow experienced by the w phase due to the stronger interactions between the w fluid and the solid walls as explained in the observations and reported in li et al 2005 the effect of wettability on the relative permeability behavior of the fluid pair is a balance between the enhancements to flow due to higher phase connectivity and the resistances due to larger fluid solid interfacial areas however our observations of the relative permeability curves at neutral wetting conditions highlight the complex nature of intermediate wetting systems as the wetting state is varied from an oil wetting condition to a neutral wetting condition the relative permeability of the oil phase increases as expected because it is no longer confined to flow strictly in the narrow regions along the surfaces of the domain however a lower extent of reduction in the water relative permeability was observed as the wettability state was changed from an oil wetting to a neutral wetting condition it seems that changes in the w phase relative permeability are influenced by wettability and the flow is enhanced by relaxing the wetting condition on the other hand the pore morphology is such that no significant reductions in the relative permeability of the nw phase occur as we transition from a strong wetting to a neutral wetting condition except at higher saturations of the nw phase only once the wettability of the sample has been transformed such that the nw phase is now the w phase do we begin to observe significant reductions in the phase relative permeability in the high porosity domain being investigated in order to better illustrate the effects of wettability on phase connectivity and flow behavior the fluid configurations at the same time step are presented in fig 17 for the three wettability states investigated as demonstrated by increasing the strength of one fluid s affinity to the solid surface improved phase connectivity is observed for the w fluid which flows in layers adjacent to the solid surfaces thereby allowing the nw fluid to flow through the center of the pores as a result the w fluid is found in the tighter regions of the pore space adjacent to a solid surface thus leaving large amounts of the nw fluid in the wider regions of the pore space therefore as the domain becomes more wetting lower relative permeability values for the w phase are expected due to the resistance to the flow caused by the adjacent solid surfaces in comparison to the nw phase which flows more easily through the larger portions of the pore space anderson 1987 li et al 2005 as the wettability is varied to a neutral wetting condition the flow behavior becomes more complicated and we observe a combination of concave and convex interfaces the two components equally wet the surface and the relative permeability values are dependent on the interaction between pore geometry and wettability in intermediate wet conditions the interface curvature is a function of the pore geometry and the angularity of the pores as shown in rabbani et al 2018 consequently under intermediate wet conditions the co existence of concave and convex interfaces signifies the simultaneous occurrence of imbibition and drainage in various regions of the pore space rabbani et al 2017 bakhshian et al 2020 by comparing the nw fluid configurations presented in fig 17 green component in neutral and oil wetting conditions we can see that the nw phase maintains a similar degree of connectivity in both situations as a consequence of the pore geometry as a result the nw phase relative permeability becomes a stronger function of the phase connectivity and less dependent on the wettability condition due to the large porosity of the sample which allows the nw phase to be located in the larger pore spaces even under neutral wet conditions as a result the reason for the smaller changes in the nw phase relative permeability after wettability alteration is the effect of phase connectivity as a result of pore morphology and the smaller fluid solid interfacial area once the originally nw phase begins to wet the surface water in a water wetting domain we observe a reduction in the relative permeability at all saturations as expected these observations highlight the importance of accurately capturing both the domain and wettability heterogeneity in a porous medium sample due to their combined influence on the pore scale fluid displacement mechanisms in the next section the effect of a heterogeneous wettability condition will be investigated in order to further analyze the factors contributing to wettability heterogeneity 3 3 heterogeneous wettability although it is algorithmically simple and appealing to assume that the wettability distribution is uniform across the whole domain this is not representative of the true nature of wettability in real reservoir systems in fact most reservoirs display mixed wettability characteristics and moreover the wettability altered fractions of the reservoir cannot be expected to have uniform wetting characteristics therefore in this section the effect of heterogeneous wettability is investigated by generating domains with increasing wettability altered fractions 25 50 75 100 the wettability heterogeneity is generated by randomly assigning locations where wettability is altered and performing different equal sized perturbations in all directions such that bounded regions of wettability altered locations with various sizes are created until the wettability altered fraction threshold is reached assuming an initially water wet domain the fractions altered are wetting with respect to oil thus resembling a drainage process where oil displaces an initially water wet medium the simulations are performed for a constant ca number c a 6 5 x 10 4 and under constant initial fluid saturations and configurations in the following sections the effects of the wettability altered fraction the degree of wettability alteration and the spatially varying contact angle assignment on the flow behavior are investigated 3 3 1 effect of fraction altered in order to test and demonstrate the importance of wettability alteration and specifically the effect of varying the wettability altered fraction in the domain the following sets of simulations are carried out the relative permeability curves and the fluid distributions are obtained for a fully water wet domain θ 20 three domains of increasing wettability altered fractions with respect to oil 25 50 and 75 and a fully oil wet domain θ 160 it should be noted however that in the intermediate domains with fractional wettability alteration the portions of the domain that have not undergone wettability alteration remain strongly wetting with respect to water for example in the 25 wettability altered domain the wettability state of 25 of the total solid surface area is altered to become strongly oil wetting θ 160 while the remaining 75 remains strongly wetting with respect to water θ 20 we conduct the investigations on the 401 401 lu 2 and 788 788 lu 2 domains to ensure that our observations are a consequence of wettability alteration and not artifacts of the domain size used the relative permeability curves obtained for the two subset domains investigated with the different wettability altered fractions are presented in figs 18 and 19 similar trends are observed in the relative permeability curves for the two domains investigated however the extent of the differences are more pronounced in the smaller domain due to its higher porosity and lower tortuosity as the evolution from a completely water wetting domain 0 to an oil wetting domain 100 occurs the relative permeability of water and oil increase and decrease respectively for all saturation values this occurs because water transitions from being the w fluid to the nw fluid and the opposite occurs for oil where the w fluid resides on the solid surface and flows in the narrower regions of the pore space while the nw fluid flows in the wider regions of the pore space a closer observation of kro at low oil saturations so shows that it declines sharply in the 0 case indicating water wet conditions very low water relative permeability at low water saturations high so with a sharp rise at high water saturations is indicative of mixed wet oil wet conditions although we expect the fractional wettability curves to be located between the two completely wetting cases this is only partially observed this trend is observed for so 0 5 and sw 0 8 generally speaking at high saturations of each fluid the relative permeability trend with the fractional values located between the two completely wetting cases is observed in other words once the saturations are high enough to overcome any microscale effects occurring due to initial saturation or wettability distributions the relative permeability curves conform to the expected behavior due to improved phase connectivity however at low and intermediate saturations of each fluid the resistance to flow in the fractional wettability domains does not necessarily follow a pattern as we increment the portion of the domain being wetted therefore situations can arise where the resistance to flow to the oil phase in a fractionally wetting domain with respect to oil is greater than in a completely oil wetting domain zhao et al 2018 for example oil relative permeability values in a domain that is fractionally wetting with respect to oil 25 50 are lower than those in a completely oil wetting domain 100 for so 0 5 as shown in the oil relative permeability curves in fig 19 similarly water relative permeability values in a domain that is fractionally wetting with respect to water are lower than those in a completely water wetting domain 0 for sw 0 8 as shown in the water relative permeability curves in fig 19 our results demonstrate very similar characteristics to those reported in zhao et al 2018 and hwang et al 2006 especially for the higher tortuosity domain an alternative approach to determining and quantifying the restrictions to flow of a fluid system comprised of two phases is a plot of the sum of the relative permeability of the two phases k r o k r w in these plots the lower the sum of the relative permeability of the two phases the larger the resistance to flow the plot of the relative permeability sum as a function of increasing oil saturation for the domains investigated is presented in fig 20 our results are consistent with what has been reported in zhao et al 2018 at high oil saturations so 0 85 the resistance to flow is highest in the completely oil wetting domain 100 and lowest in the completely water wetting domain 0 with the resistance to flow in the fractional wettability domains occurring in order between the two extremes similarly for higher water saturations so 0 15 a similar phenomenon is observed where the resistance to flow is highest in the completely water wetting domain 0 and lowest in the completely oil wetting domain 100 and the fractional wettability curves are located between them however as we approach intermediate saturation values we observe in the fractional wettability domains a larger resistance to flow than in the completely wetting domains in the form of lower relative permeability sums an analysis of the pore scale flow details is needed in order to justify the macroscale relative permeability behavior observed the wettability distributions assigned in addition to the fluid configurations at equivalent time steps for the fractional wettability alteration test are presented in fig 21 as we transition from a strongly water wet domain to a strongly oil wet domain increasing fractions of the domain undergo wettability alteration from water wet to oil wet represented by the yellow surfaces since oil is the nw phase in the water wet domain it flows in the form of ganglia of varying sizes through the center of the large pores surrounded by the w phase in samples with a larger fraction of wettability alteration the oil phase now the w phase with respect to the portion of the domain that has undergone wettability alteration becomes increasingly connected and attached to the wettability altered surfaces the oil phase now begins to incrementally flow in layers along the wettability altered portions of the domain while still retaining some of the nw phase flow features in the portions of the domain that have not undergone wettability alteration finally in the strongly oil wetting domain the oil phase has now completely transitioned from the nw phase to the w phase and flows in thin connected layers along the solid surfaces as the fraction of oil wetting regions increases we observe an increasing amount of entrapped oil clusters controlled primarily by the wettability distribution and the pore morphology in the fractionally altered domains the oil phase displays random distributions and forms more tortuous flow paths than in the completely wetting domains as a consequence of the wettability alteration that has occurred moreover we also confirm the presence of both concave and convex interfaces in the fractionally altered domains which have implications on the pore scale flow mechanisms as has been observed in bakhshian and hosseini 2019 and rabbani et al 2017 the more tortuous flow paths especially at intermediate saturations provide insight into the larger resistance to flow observed in the domains that have undergone fractional wettability alteration in comparison to the completely wetting domains as a result this demonstrates the importance of accurately determining the locations where wettability alteration occurs since it has a significant effect on the general flow behavior of the system and the resulting pore scale and macroscale flow properties 3 3 2 effect of degree of alteration in a real flow system the degree of wettability alteration is largely dependent on the time duration of the wettability alteration process as a result the portions of the domain that undergo wettability alteration will not necessarily transform from being water wet to oil wet and vice versa furthermore we expect to observe a distribution of contact angles after wettability alteration where the new wetting state of the wettability altered domains is proportional to the time that specific region interacted with wettability altering agents in this section in order to isolate the effect of the degree of wettability alteration the portions of the domain that have undergone wettability alteration will instead demonstrate a neutral wetting θ 90 preference in comparison to the oil wetting θ 160 preference from the previous section the portions that have not undergone wettability alteration will remain water wet θ 20 for example in the 25 fractionally altered domain 75 of the domain remains strongly water wet whereas 25 of the domain displays neutral wetting characteristics in the 100 domain the whole domain is modeled to have undergone wettability alteration and displays neutral wetting characteristics with respect to both fluids the relative permeability curves are obtained and compared to those obtained in the previous section in order to test the effect of the degree of wettability alteration the investigations are conducted on the 401 401 lu 2 and 788 788 lu 2 domains and the relative permeability curves are shown in figs 22 and 23 the oil phase demonstrates expected behavior by altering the wetting property of the wettability altered regions from a strong oil wetting condition to a neutral wetting condition the relative permeability of the oil phase increases as expected as shown in figs 22 and 23 due to the decreased fluid solid interfacial area and the lower likelihood of flowing in the narrower regions of the pore space however what is more important to note is that the extent of the variation in the relative permeability curves is also dependent on the fraction of the domain undergoing wettability alteration as the wettability altered fraction increases the variation in the oil relative permeability increases the more interesting observations are those associated with the behavior of the water phase the nw phase with respect to the wettability altered regions since the water phase strongly wets a portion of the domain we do not observe significant changes in the relative permeability curves as shown in fig 22 moreover the high porosity nature of the domain means that there exists a significant amount of large pore spaces which the nw phase occupies therefore the flow behavior of the nw phase in a large porosity domain becomes less dependent on the solid fluid interfacial area and consequently the wettability alteration in the higher tortuosity domain 788 788 lu 2 we do not observe significant variations in the water relative permeability curves for the domains that are predominantly wetting with respect to water i e the 25 domain that is 75 strongly wetting with respect to water and the 50 domain that is 50 strongly wetting with respect to water the mobility of the water phase is still dictated by the portions of the domain that have not undergone wettability alteration water wet regions however in the 75 domain that is only 25 strongly wetting with respect to water wettability alteration effects at a significant portion of the domain begin to overcome the effects of the smaller wetting portion of the domain and we begin to observe variations in the water relative permeability curves as a result we conclude that the flow pattern of the water phase and the resulting relative permeability curves in high porosity domains that are becoming less water wetting are dominated by the large pore spaces and the regions that remain strongly water wetting and become affected by the portions of the domain that have undergone wettability alteration once a significant percentage of the domain has undergone wettability alteration in addition it was also observed that a neutral wetting condition improved the mobility of both phases in the 788 788lu 2 but only the oil phase in the 401 401 lu 2 a similar discrepancy has been previously reported in the literature landry et al 2014 li et al 2005 which can be attributed to the competition between the improved mobility of the nw phase due to a smaller fluid solid interfacial area and the reduced mobility due to a decrease in connectivity in addition as mentioned earlier the co existence of concave and convex interfaces in neutral wetting conditions is heavily influenced by the pore geometry and angularity and influences the pore scale displacement mechanisms governing the flow and the mobility of the phases rabbani et al 2017 2018 bakhshian et al 2020 rabbani et al 2016 in summary for an initially water saturated porous medium as increasing portions of the domain undergo varying degrees of wettability alteration towards an intermediate or oil wetting condition the mobility of the oil phase is sensitive to the degree of wettability alteration and the difference is proportional to the fraction altered on the other hand the mobility of the water phase in a high porosity domain which continues to strongly wet the unaltered portions of the domain is less sensitive to the degree of alteration until a significant portion of the domain has undergone wettability alteration which also indicates that the degree of alteration effects are proportional to the fraction altered the observations in this section demonstrate the correlations between the wettability altered fraction the pore geometry and the degree of wettability alteration and highlight the need to constantly assess this for realistic predictions in a porous medium sample a heterogeneous wettability investigation was conducted in landry et al 2014 by altering the wettability of the nodes in contact with the nw phase at the end of homogeneous wet simulations for s w 0 5 the wettability of the nodes was altered to preferentially wet the nw phase and a number of mixed wet states was created the authors observed a significant reduction in the nw phase relative permeability since portions of the domain were altered to become wetting with respect to the originally nw phase moreover it was determined that the degree of wettability alteration also impacted the extent of the relative permeability variation of the originally nw phase this is consistent with what we observed in section 3 3 1 and section 3 3 2 as larger portions of an initially water wetting domain were altered to become oil wetting we observed a reduction in the oil relative permeability and a dependency on the fraction of the domain undergoing wettability alteration as shown in figs 18 and 19 this was also confirmed in hwang et al 2006 where an experimental study on the effects of fractional wettability on capillary pressure and relative permeability relations was conducted however we also observed at low oil saturations lower oil phase relative permeability in a domain with fractional wettability than in a completely oil wetting domain as has been reported in zhao et al 2018 where oil water two phase flow was simulated in domains of increasing oil wetting fractions and the relative permeability was computed additionally in section 3 3 2 we saw a dependence in the oil phase relative permeability on the degree of wettability alteration in landry et al 2014 wettability alteration was implemented for a specific initial saturation and only one specific case of fractional wettability alteration was studied therefore we also added an additional observation that the dependency of the oil phase relative permeability on the degree of wettability alteration increases when a larger fraction of the domain has undergone wettability alteration in an originally water wet system as shown in figs 22 and 23 in terms of the water phase initially w phase in a water wetting domain it was reported in landry et al 2014 that the w phase water in our simulations was insensitive to wettability alteration this was observed because wettability was unaltered at the locations in contact with the w phase and the relative permeability of the w phase was dependent on the established flow paths since we alter the wettability randomly at increasing portions of the domain in section 3 3 1 we eventually observe an increase in the water phase relative permeability in addition we also observe lower water phase relative permeability at certain saturations in a domain with fractional wettability than in a water wetting domain as shown in figs 18 and 19 and observed in zhao et al 2018 moreover we confirm that the water phase relative permeability is less sensitive to the degree of wettability alteration for lower wettability altered fractions and we conclude that the flow of the water phase remains controlled by the unaltered portions of the domain water wetting potions and is not severely impacted by the fluid solid interfacial area in a high porosity domain until a significant fraction of the domain has undergone wettability alteration by conducting simulations in a more tortuous pore space 788 788 lu 2 we observe a dependency between the extent of change in the water phase relative permeability due to the degree of wettability alteration and the fraction of the domain undergoing wettability alteration as larger portions of the domain undergo wettability alteration the water phase relative permeability becomes more sensitive to the degree of wettability alteration at the portion of the domain that is not water wetting as shown in fig 23 these observations shed insight into the complex nature of mixed wet flows and the conflicting observations in the literature with regards to flow ability and residual trapping in mixed wet systems as a consequence of the strong dependence between wettability and pore geometry and highlight the need for additional investigations 3 3 3 effect of contact angle assignment as mentioned earlier once wettability alteration has occurred the wetting state in the domain and even more specifically in a pore can vary as a result in this section we investigate the effect of assigning a non uniform contact angle distribution by comparing the results with those obtained earlier when a constant contact angle was assigned in the first investigation a conservative distribution of contact angles is investigated that distribution will be expanded in the second investigation for all of the domains that have undergone wettability alteration the two wettability states investigated are neutral wetting and strong wetting for the neutral wetting case the constant contact angle assignment is performed by assigning a θ 90 contact angle while the non uniform assignment is done by randomly assigning contact angles from the following gaussian distribution θ 90 15 similarly in the strong wetting case the constant contact angle assignment is performed by assigning a θ 160 contact angle while the non uniform assignment is done by randomly assigning contact angles from the following gaussian distribution θ 155 15 the resulting relative permeability curves are presented in fig 24 and we observe very minor differences between the constant and non uniform contact angle assignment however this is attributed to the very narrow distribution of contact angles assigned furthermore similar to what has been observed in the degree of alteration test the extent of the variation in the relative permeability curves also is dependent on the fraction of the domain undergoing wettability alteration although the differences are minor the variation in the relative permeability increases as the wettability altered fraction increases in a real and more heterogeneous porous media system where the fluids in place reside for a very long time and in larger volumes a larger contact angle distribution usually exists for example in alratrout et al 2017 an automatic algorithm which measures the contact angle between immiscible fluids directly on pore scale x ray images was developed the algorithm was validated and then implemented on a ketton sample for both a water wet and a wettability altered system in the initial water wet system the sample showed a gaussian distribution with a mean contact angle equal to 71 and a narrow standard deviation of 12 in the altered wettability system the contact angles were more widely spread with a mean contact angle equal to 90 and a standard deviation of 26 similarly in alhammadi et al 2017 three wettability aging protocols were performed on three samples from the same carbonate core plug as a result three different wettability states were obtained with the following distributions 77 21 weakly water wet system 104 26 mixed wet system and 94 24 mixed wet system in order to test the wider contact angle distribution the following investigations are conducted for the neutral and strong wetting cases the contact angle distributions are 90 45 and 35 25 the new and old contact angle distributions are tested on the originally water wet 0 and oil wet 100 domains in order for the results to be comparable the resulting relative permeability curves are presented in fig 25 by comparing the relative permeability curves obtained when a narrow and wide contact angle distribution is assigned we observe that the differences in the relative permeability curves do indeed increase but not significantly for the neutral wetting case the distribution is centered at the same value used in the constant contact angle assignment 90 and therefore the difference is less than that observed in the strong wetting case where the distribution is centered at a different value than that used in the constant contact angle assignment this is also attributed to the pore geometry effect where the nw phase relative permeability in the domain studied is strongly correlated with phase connectivity and the smaller fluid solid interfacial area as a result in the context of a spatial contact angle assignment the importance of capturing the specific contact angle in every pore is dependent on the pore geometry in addition to the contact angle distribution and the severity of the standard deviations for example in a tortuous sample where a very wide distribution of contact angles with a large standard deviation is observed it is recommended to capture the spatial variation in the contact angles 4 conclusions and future work in this work the scmc lbm model was able to simulate the expected trends for multiphase flow in porous media under varying capillary numbers viscosity ratios and homogeneous wettability conditions it was also utilized to isolate and analyze the different factors that contribute to wettability heterogeneity the effect of the fraction of the domain undergoing wettability alteration the degree of wettability alteration at the wettability altered pores and the assignment of a spatially varying contact angle distribution were investigated in order to determine their relative importance in order to conduct the investigation we generated domains of increasing fractions of wettability altered pores from a completely water wet domain to an oil wet domain the main conclusions drawn from this study are the effect of wettability on the relative permeability behavior and the fluid configurations observed acts through two opposing mechanisms enhancement and resistance to flow due to increased connectivity and larger fluid solid interfacial areas respectively in a fractional wettability system the same two mechanisms are present but to varying extents depending on the amount of pores that have undergone wettability alteration the extent of the wettability alteration and the variance in the contact angle assignment we observe that a larger resistance to the overall flow and more tortuous flow paths specifically at comparable saturations of the two fluids exist in a domain that has undergone wettability alteration in comparison to a completely water oil wet domain as we fractionally transition from a water wet to an oil wet domain the degree of wettability alteration becomes more important with the increasing fractions and its effect more prominent on the flow behavior and relative permeability curves of the oil phase on the other hand the flow of the water phase in a high porosity domain remains dictated by the large pore spaces and the regions of the domain that have not undergone wettability alteration water wet until a significant portion of the domain undergoes wettability alteration the accurate spatial contact angle assignment also demonstrates a dependence on the fraction altered and becomes more important for domains that display large deviations in the contact angle values we find that the relative permeability and the flow behavior in the context of wettability alteration are influenced primarily by the fraction of the pores undergoing wettability alteration after primary drainage followed by the degree of alteration and the contact angle assignment which are also dependent on the wettability altered fraction the interactions between pore morphology and wettability heterogeneity especially under neutral wetting conditions strongly influence the pore scale displacement mechanisms and highlight the importance of lattice boltzmann simulations which easily incorporate domain and wettability heterogeneity the observations in this study demonstrate the intricate interplay and co dependence of many factors when studying wettability alteration and enhance the argument for an all encompassing algorithm which can correctly capture the time dependent wettability state of every pore in order to better understand the relationship between domain and wettability heterogeneity and the resulting pore scale flow mechanisms that will be

388,catalytic membranes can degrade gaseous pollutants to clean gas via a catalytic reaction to achieve green emissions further a catalytic membrane is a three scale porous medium membranes used in catalytic filters usually have thicknesses of centimeters or millimeters and consist of active washcoat particles inert material and microscale micron size pores the washcoat particles are porous material with nanoscale pores the catalytic reactions are heterogeneous surface reactions and they occur on the surface of the nanopores obviously simulations at fully resolved pore scale are not feasible and upscaling techniques have to be applied it is known that the same microscale problem can be upscaled to different macroscale equations depending on the characteristic numbers in this paper we study the homogenization of reactive flow in the presence of strong absorption in the washcoat particles two reactive transport regimes are studied where in both the reaction dominates over the convection and the diffusion péclet s number in the first one is of order 1 and in the second one it is proportional to the ratio of the thickness of the catalytic membrane and the characteristic length of the microscale pores two different upscaled equations are obtained respectively direct numerical simulation at microscale is used to validate these derived macroscale equations keywords reactive flow catalytic filter homogenization validation 1 introduction particulate filters are a standard component of the exhaust purification system of diesel vehicles and recently they are also introduced for gasoline vehicles see e g yang et al 2018 current filters in automotive catalysis use honeycomb monolith structures see e g fig 1 with a large number of parallel channels that are alternatingly connected to the inlet and to the outlet so that the gas is forced through the walls membranes and the soot is deposited inside or on top of the wall membrane current exhaust systems contain several different catalysts for the removal of nox co and unburned hydrocarbons there is a strong interest to integrate some of the catalytic functionality into the particulate filter as such multifunctional catalytic filters allow to reduce the number of components of the exhaust system the resulting more compact exhaust systems are advantageous in terms of weight space requirements and cost and allow faster heat up during vehicle cold start in diesel vehicles mostly the diesel oxidation catalyst functionality or the selective catalytic reduction scr functionality have been integrated in the particulate filter for gasoline vehicles particulate filters with integrated three way catalytic functionality have been developed since these devices simultaneously remove co hydrocarbons no and soot they are also called four way catalysts the focus of our study is the usage of catalytic membranes for gas cleaning and more precisely the modeling of the processes within such membrane in the case when the reaction dominates the diffusion and the convection for discussion on modeling and simulation of particulate filters we refer to iliev et al 2015 for simulation of reactive flow in 3d ct image geometries we refer e g to iliev lakdawala nessler prill vutov yang and yao 2017 and greiner robert prill iliev van setten and votsmeier 2019 due to their importance for industry catalytic membranes have become a subject of intensive studies in particular in the area of modeling and simulation of these processes the thickness of the catalytic membranes is usually of millimeter or centimeter size the membranes are intrinsic multiscale consisting of inert matrix micron size pores and washcoat active particles the latter being nanoscale porous catalytic filters or catalytic reactors which may have decimeter or meter size are on a bigger scale membranes serve as walls of the channels from which a catalytic filter is built therefore within this paper sometimes the word wall is also used in the sense of membrane despite the importance of the catalytic filters and the achievements in developing new more active washcoat there is a lack of rigorous mathematical knowledge for the performance of these advanced washcoats for which the reaction can dominate the diffusion and or convection we observe that the industry is still broadly using heuristically derived models or models derived for the diffusion dominated reactive transport regimes in many cases such models are postulated using the large experimental knowledge and the similarity with other processes obviously such models have been validated often after calibration for many particular regimes and have played an important role in the design and optimization of catalytic filters special software tools like detchem www detchem com have been developed based on such models and general purpose software tools like comsol multiphysics www comsol com and fluent www fluent com have been used to solve some of these models simulation of processes in catalytic filters is discussed e g in inderwildi and richard 2005 pereira et al 2014 yang et al 2016 wang et al 2019 hettel et al 2019 to name just a few papers however as discussed many times in the literature in connection with different application areas see e g the discussion on page 1 in davit et al 2010 the problems with the heuristic models are that the conditions and the parameter range of their validity is not clearly determined a short discussion on the upscaling methods for reactive flows in porous media will be useful for understanding the focus and the novelty of this paper the main approaches for upscaling are asymptotic homogenization and volume averaging for a comprehensive discussion on these as well as on other upscaling approaches in conjunctions with porous media we refer to the recent overview paper battiato et al 2019 see also references therein advantages and disadvantages of the presented upscaling approaches are discussed there and what is very important and useful the area of applicability of the these methods and regimes is discussed as well for general discussions on homogenization we refer e g to sánchez palencia 1980 jikov et al 1994 hornung 1997 mei and vernescu 2010 and bakhvalov et al 2012 in particular upscaling from the single phase stokes problem to the darcy problem is discussed e g in the chapter allaire 1997 by allaire in hornung 1997 the reactive flows are characterized by an interplay between convection diffusion reaction and pore scale morphology asymptotic homogenization for reactive flows at the earlier period was limited to the diffusion dominated case a general homogenization result on this approach in conjunction with surface heterogeneous reaction can be found e g in hornung and jäger 1991 so called cell problems in terms of pdes are defined in the papers mentioned above and their solution need to be post processed in order to compute the effective coefficients for the macroscale upscaled equation note that the homogenization section in battiato et al 2019 emphasizes and states that the standard homogenization approaches do not work for the reaction dominated case see also battiato tartakovsky tartakovsky and scheibe 2009 and boso and battiato 2013 but they do not elaborate on the advanced homogenization approaches which we shortly discuss below more challenging is the upscaling in the case of dominant convection and or reaction which is the case of large péclet and or damköhler number recall that large péclet number indicates that the convection dominates the diffusion and large damköhler number of first kind indicates that the reaction dominates the diffusion such problems were first considered in the study of dispersion in porous media for large péclet numbers and non zero drift classical two scale expansions lead either to systems of equations without solution or to low order precision hyperbolic models the difficulty was solved by auriault and adler 1995 where two different time scales were introduced and by mauri rubinstein who included higher order terms in the expansion in rubinstein and mauri 1986 mauri 1991 if the model contains also the reaction terms with a high damköhler number reaction dominated problems then the problem becomes even more complicated in papanicolaou 1995 the effective drift was taken as a part of the two scale expansion and it allowed for a successful study of dispersion effects the approach was further developed in works of marušić paloka and piatnitski 2005 and allaire and raphael 2007 the presence of a large drift was handled by introducing a drift in the expansion and a large bulk reaction terms lead to an exponential decay linked to an eigenvalue problem the idea was applied to the reaction diffusion systems in porous media with surface reactions by allaire et al 2010a and allaire et al 2010b the case of diffusion and reactions was studied in allaire and piatnitski 2010 models involving also a surface diffusion were studied by allaire and hutridurga 2015 and allaire and hutridurga 2016 it should be remarked that in addition to the pdes based cell problems needed to calculate the effective coefficients in this case an auxiliary eigenvalue problem is derived on the periodicity cell and its solution is needed to account for the exponential concentration decay caused by the high damköhler number note that the formulation of an eigenvalue problem in order to account for the exponential decay was known before adopting it in the context of homogenization e g see the one dimensional analysis for time periodic reactive flows in shapiro and brenner 1987 and its extension to two dimensional arrays in edwards et al 1993 the last two papers unlike all other papers cited here are formulated with respect to probability density functions for more details on the history of this ansatz we refer to the literature in the above mentioned homogenization papers an important conclusion can be drawn based on the above papers namely even starting from the same microscale problem for different sizes of the characteristic numbers the homogenization results in different upscaled macroscale model depending on the considered regime different here means that these can be different types of equations which cannot be converted to each other by simple fitting of the coefficients for examples the drift term in the case of dominant convection and the term with the exponential decay of the concentration in the case of large damköhler number are not present in the basic convection diffusion reaction equation derived for the diffusion dominated case and their effects can not be accounted for by tuning the coefficients in this basic equation this already implies that trying just to fit the coefficients in a heuristically postulated equation is an approach which does not lead to predictive modeling and in particular does not highlight the area of validity of a heuristic model it should be noted that the literature on homogenization of reactive flow in conjunctions with catalytic filters is very scarce in hornung and jäger 1991 hornung et al 1994 conca et al 2003 2004 díaz et al 2016 the authors consider this problem but they neglect the convection and consider only diffusion a reaction equation also the regimes they discuss differ from regimes which are considered in this paper the literature on the theory and application of the method of volume averaging mva in conjunction with multiscale passive and active transport in porous media is very rich basic references are e g whitaker 2013 slattery 1999 bear and bachmat 2012 while at the early stages of the mva developments the closures needed to separate the scales were based on a number of assumptions the predictivity of mva was significantly increased after the rigorous derivation of pdes based auxilliary problems for the closure variables note that there is conceptual similarity between these closure problems and the cell problems derived in the homogenization in both cases local problems at the microscale are solved in order to compute the effective coefficients for the macroscale model as a part of a scale separation algorithm although the closure problems are discussed in the context of periodic media applicability of the derived in this way volume averaged macroscale models to problems in random porous media is justified in several papers for discussion on the derivation of the closure problems we refer to e g quintard and whitaker 2005 wood et al 2007 quintard and whitaker 1998 valdés parada lasseux and whitaker 2019 see also the respective section and the references in the recent overview battiato et al 2019 the use of pdes based closure problems for computing corrections deviations in mva is useful in investigating the impact of the reaction on the effective diffusivity and on the effective reaction rate a validation of the derived macroscale models by comparison with the solution of the respective microscale problem is available but only for the diffusion reaction problems i e in absence of convection see e g valdés parada et al 2017 these papers however consider the diffusion dominated case called also mixing controlled case i e the cases da 1 and in few cases da 1 the catalysis has attracted the attention of the volume averaging community and below we mention selectively several papers which deal with it thorough discussion on volume averaging in absence of convection i e diffusion reaction model in catalytic pellets is presented in the early paper ryan et al 1981 closure equations are proposed and different regimes are discussed unlike our case ideal gas under constant pressure is considered there in whitaker 1987 the analysis is extended to develop a general relation for all the molar fluxes in an n component system in de souza and whitaker 2003 authors consider catalytic porous bed reactor elaborate on the dispersion in the fluid phase in the case of periodic media present closure problems under clearly defined length scale constraints and provide expressions for the effective coefficients the important question when the reaction influences the effective diffusivity is discussed e g in valdés parada and alvarez ramirez 2010 valdés parada and aguilar madera 2011 the respective closure problems are solved for a range of thiele modulus proportional to damköhler number for several periodic geometries and the presented plots give quantitative answer on the studied question the solution of the closure problems and calculations of the effective parameters in periodic and in random porous media is a part of the recent paper valdés parada aguilar madera 2011 valdés parada lasseux whitaker 2017 in the latter the volume averaged macroscale models for catalytic reactions in the presence of diffusive transport no convection were revisited and expansion with respect to thiele modulus was used to analyze them for thiele modulus going up to one recall that the analysis earlier was presented only for thiele modulus being much smaller than unity an interesting part of the paper is the validation of the upscaled model in comparison with direct numerical simulation of the microscale problem under steady and transient conditions study of dispersion in porous media with large péclet numbers using the volume averaging is also one of the favorite research field of michel quintard he wrote several seminal papers on the problem and contributed on essential way to our understanding of the phenomenon see e g quintard and whitaker 1993 and quintard and whitaker 2005 the goal of this paper is to present a rigorous derivation of the upscaled model of the reactive flow through catalytic membranes which are the essential component of the catalytic filters for the regime of strong absorption within the washcoat particles the ratio between the characteristic size of the micropores and thickness of the membrane denoted by ε is a small number we consider reaction dominated problems with the absorption in the washcoat particles being of order of o ε 2 for the transport through the membrane we consider either weak or moderate convection p e f o 1 and p e f o ε 1 and apply the ansatz from allaire and raphael 2007 to derive the homogenized models in addition we compute the effective coefficients and validate the derived upscaled model through a comparison with the full solution of the microscale problem up to our knowledge the regimes with dominating absorption which are considered here are rigorously discussed neither in homogenization nor in volume averaging literature we are also not aware of using direct numerical simulation at microscale for validation of derived macroscale equations in conjunction with considered here regimes the reminder of the paper is organized as follows section 2 is dedicated to the derivation of upscaled equations for strong absorption in the washcoat particles and two flow regimes namely p e f o 1 and p e f o ε 1 section 3 deals with the validation of the derived upscaled equations by means of comparison of their solution with the solution of the microscale problems 2 upscaling of transport in presence of adsorption the membranes used in catalytic filters are three scale porous media they consist of active washcoat particles inert material and microscale pores the washcoat particles are porous material with nanoscale pores the inert material is ignored here because it does not play a role in the adsorption process a sketch of the three scale geometry is presented in fig 1 the characteristic length of the nanopores is denoted by ℓ np the characteristic length of the micropores is denoted by ℓ mp and finally the characteristic length at macroscale catalytic membrane thickness is l we suppose ℓ np ℓ mp l for the sake of simplicity we concentrate on the following strict separation of scales ℓ np ℓ mp δ 1 ℓ mp l ε 1 also we suppose rigid solid grains 2 1 the geometry we start by introducing the nanoporous domain ω w its geometry is based on the dimensionless unit periodicity cell z 0 1 n on which we consider a smooth partition zs z np where zs is the solid part and z np is the pore space its periodic extension is a smooth connected open subset γnp is the internal boundary between z np and zs the dimensionless pore space is ω np j z n ℓ np ℓ mp z np j and the dimensionless total reactive surface is b np j z n ℓ np ℓ mp γ np j it is supposed that the ratio between the characteristic micropores length ℓ mp and the nanopores length ℓ np of the periodic structure is always a natural number the finite union of all unit cells dilated by ℓ np ℓ mp gives a parallelepiped ω w r n n 2 3 with a characteristic length ℓ mp ℓ np containing a periodic arrangement of solid particles with reactive surface the dimensional nanoporous domain ω w is obtained after a dilatation of ω w by a scale factor ℓ mp ω np and b np are obtained analogously next we introduce the membrane macroscale domain which has micro scale porosity for simplicity we suppose that the macroscale domain ω is a parallelepiped consisting of a periodic structure in r n n 2 3 it is supposed that the ratio between the characteristic length l of the parallelepiped and the length ℓ mp of the periodic structure is always a natural number the unit periodicity cell is y 0 1 n on which we consider a smooth partition yw y mp where yw is the washcoat particle considered as effective averaged media and y mp is the pore space γmp is the interface between yw and y mp by periodic translations we obtain the domain occupied by the microscale pores ω mp j z n j k l ℓ mp ℓ mp y mp j and the domain occupied by washcoat particles ω w j z n j k l ℓ mp ℓ mp y w j the interface between the micropores and the averaged washcoat particles is denoted by b mp j z n j k l ℓ mp ℓ mp γ mp j further on ω w ω w ℓ mp ω mp ω mp ℓ mp and b mp b mp ℓ mp remark 1 in this article we perform two successive homogenizations the first one is undertaken in the washcoat particles which are porous media themselves containing the nanopores after obtaining the homogenized model in the washcoat particles we undertake the second homogenization in the membrane consisting of the micro pores and the washcoat grains an alternative is to average using the three scale expansion the obtained homogenized models have similarity but differ in general particularly at the interfaces which motivated us to introduce an additional parameter γmp in section 2 4 the used notations are summarized in table 1 note that subscript np indicates values or functions within nanopores the subscript mp indicated values or functions within microscale pores subscript w indicates values or functions defined in the averaged washcoat particles throughout the paper bar is used for denoting the dimensional variables while no bar is used for the dimensionless variables the permeability of the nanoporous particles is of order o ℓ np 2 and the advection velocity of the solute there is negligible with respect to the diffusion and the reaction only the diffusion and adsorption effects are important within the washcoat particles it is assumed that fick s law is applicable and furthermore a first order linear adsorption model is considered in this paper the model for the evolution of the concentration c at nano scale is given by 1 c t div x d p x c 0 in ω np 2 ν d p x c k α c on b np where ν is the outward unit normal as it is common in homogenization derivations periodic boundary conditions are imposed it should be noted that the derived upscaled equations are valid also for other types of boundary conditions 2 2 dimensionless form of the model in the nanoscale pores within washcoat particles let v c be the characteristic transport velocity in the membrane and let d p d p d np d mp be the characteristic value of the diffusion coefficient in the micropores and in the nanopores without lack of generality considered to be the same k α is the adsorption coefficient on the nanopores walls two characteristic time scales are introduced 1 t t l v c the transport time at macroscale 2 t d ℓ mp 2 d p the diffusion time in the nanopores next we set 1 pe f l v c d p péclet s number at

have supposed that the ratio td tads is small with respect to one we choose the diffusion time as a characteristic time and the adsorption effects will be captured with this choice hence we set y x ℓ

particles problem 4 5 is upscaled using the method of two scale asymptotic expansions see e g papanicolaou 1995 the homogenized dimensionless equation reads as follows 6 z np c w t da np δ 1 γ np c w div y d np eff y c w in ω w the homogenized diffusion matrix d np eff is symmetric positive definite and is calculated from the solution of the so called cell problem notice that the size of coefficients in front of the time derivative and in front of the effective adsorption term explains the fast decay of the concentration within the washcoat particles observed in section 5 of greiner et al 2019 the dimensional effective eq 7 in the washcoat particles is obtained from the dimensionless eq 6 by returning to the dimensional variables in ω w 7 z np c w t γ np k α ℓ np c w div x d p d

describing convection diffusion and absorption at microscale next we homogenize the microscale problem posed at the level of the averaged effective washcoat particles and the microscale pores between them on the interface between the washcoat particles and the microscale pores b mp we consider perfect contact i e continuity of the normal component of the mass flux and continuity of the concentration effects like interfacial accumulation mass transfer resistance i e discontinuity of the concentration and or the normal component of the mass flux surface diffusion deformation are not considered here thus in the microscale pores ω mp and on the interfaces between micropores and the effective washcoat particles we consider the following problem 8 c mp t v x c mp div x d p x c mp 0 in ω mp 9 ν γ mp d p x c mp ν d p d np eff x c np on b mp 10 c mp c np on b mp γmp is the interface porosity we suppose that the flow is incompressible at the micropores level and negligible in the nanopores i e 11 div y v t x y 0 in ω mp and we set v t x y 0 for y b mp and y ω w we recall that the solute reactive diffusion in the washcoat particles ω w is given by the effective homogenized averaged eq 7 and that the velocity is calculated separately by solving the stokes or navier stokes equations in ω mp with the no slip condition for it at b mp in the membrane we choose the diffusion time t d l 2 d p as characteristic time hence we set x x l v t x x ℓ mp v c v t x x ε c x t c x t and t t d t l 2 d p t recall that the dimensional variables are denoted bar the dimensionless form of the system 8 10 is 12 γ mp c mp t pe f v x c mp γ mp δ x c mp 0 in ω mp 13 ν γ mp x c mp ν d np eff x c np on b mp 14 c mp c np on b mp and the dimensionless form of the eq 7 is now rewritten with the new time and space scaling it is written not only in one washcoat particle zw but also in the domain occupying all washcoat particles namely ω w 15 z np c w t γ np k α l 2 d p ℓ np o ε 2 c w div x d

3 namely da np o δ we complete the explanation it is known that the homogenization of the system 12 14 15 depends on the size of the characteristic numbers and their ratios so that different upscaled equations are obtained depending on those numbers below we will consider the case of strong absorption rate once with moderate p e f o 1 convection and once with stronger convection p e f o ε 1 2 5 homogenization of the microscale equations in the case strong absorption and convection p e f o 1 in this subsection we concentrate to the case k α l 2 d p ℓ np o ε 2 and pe f o 1 the case pe f o ε 1 is of interest for larger injection velocities and we consider it in section 2 7 in difference to the homogenization in the nanopores here we follow allaire and raphael 2007 and allaire et al 2010a and start with a new two scale ansatz 16 s t x e r t ε 2 i 0 ε i s i t x x ε where s t x c mp t x in ω mp c w t x in ω w si is y periodic in y the fast variable at this scale is denoted by y x ε note that this notation is local and the y here should not be mixed with the y which was used locally in the previous subsection the factor r in the above expansion is the unknown effective adsorption rate the motivation for seeking the solution in this form comes from the presence of a strong bulk reaction term within the washcoat particles originating from adsorption in the nanopores and the fact that in this case a standard two scale expansion like the one in the previous section would lead to equations with no solution after plugging all these expressions into the eqs 12 15 and equating the coefficients in front of the same powers of ε we get the following cascade of equations equation of order ε 2 17 γ mp δ y c 0 m r γ mp c 0 m in y mp γ mp y c 0 m ν d np eff y c 0 n ν and c 0 m c 0 n

and the corresponding eigenfunction ψ is strictly positive and can be interpreted as a local equilibrium concentration the eigenfunctions ψ are normalized by setting 19 γ mp y mp ψ 2 y d y z np y w ψ

summarize the upscaled dimensionless equations as usual in the expansion 16 only the zeroth order term namely s 0 is considered unlike typical upscaling problems the zeroth order term here still depends on both fast y and slow x variables the advantage with respect to the full microscale problem is that the fast and slow variables terms separate see 20 which makes the solution of the upscaled problem much simpler compared to the solution of the microscale problem to find s 0 20 one needs to solve in a periodic cell the eigenvalue problem 18 for ψ y and macroscale eq 26 for s t x the upscaled coefficients in 26 are calculated according to 27 29 from the solutions of the cell problems 23 24 to complete the solution procedure according to 16 one also needs to obtain the reaction rate r which is the smallest eigenvalue of the above mentioned eigenvalue problem 18 conclusion 3 in many cases only the averaged solution is needed at macroscale in such cases we can integrate 20 over y with respect to y to introduce 30 s eff t x y mp ψ y s t x d y y w ψ y s t x d y y ψ y d y s t x recall that s t x satisfies 26 such averaging is used in the section on numerical validation when comparing the solutions of the microscale and of the macroscale problems conclusion 4 note that the dependence from the fast variable may be eliminated if a weighted mean is considered i e we can multiply 20 by ψ y and integrate thus introducing 31 s eff t x γ mp y mp ψ 2 y s t x d y z np y w ψ 2 y s t x d y having in mind that ψ y was normalized 19 we get 32 s eff t x s t x recall that s t x satisfies 26 conclusion 5 in the regime under consideration of strong adsorption k α l 2 d p ℓ p o ε 2 and with moderate advection p e f o 1 the effective dimensional homogenized equation for the solute concentration c eff reads 33 c eff t x e r t d p ℓ mp 2 ψ x ε s eff t x where s eff solves the equation 34 s eff t d p l a t x s eff d p a 0 l 2 s eff div x d p a h x s eff in ω and ψ and r are given by the spectral problem 18 r gives the effective adsorption rate and ψ can be interpreted as a local equilibrium profile between diffusion and adsorption the adsorption affects through ψ the effective transport velocity d p l a t the effective reaction coefficient d p a 0 l 2 and the effective diffusion tensor dpah 2 6 properties of the effective diffusion matrix ah hence the homogenization approach gave eq 26 as the effective dimensionless equation it is important to prove that the effective diffusion matrix ah is symmetric positive definite formula 27 is not well adapted for establishing this property in this direction we recall that the eigenfunction ψ computed by solving spectral problem 18 is strictly positive hence function ξ i w i ψ i 1 n is well defined we insert w i ψ ξ i i 1 n into system 23 and multiply the resulting system by ψζ ζ h p e r 1 y using the spectral problem 18 gives 35 γ mp y ψ 2 ζ y ξ i m γ mp ψ 2 y ξ i m y ζ 2 γ mp ζ ψ ψ y i in y mp γ

matrix ah is symmetric and positive definite 2 7 homogenization of the microscale equations in the case of strong absorption and p e o ε 1 in this subsection we suppose a larger filtration velocity

follow allaire and raphael 2007 and allaire et al 2010a and start with a two scale with drift ansatz now it has to contain also a decay 38 c p t x e r t ε 2 i 0 ε i z i t x v ε x ε where c p t x c mp t x in ω mp c w t x in ω w zi is y periodic in y for every i and v is a constant drift velocity to be determined as in section 2 5 its fast variable here is denoted by y x ε the factor and r is the unknown effective adsorption rate motivation comes from the presence of large damköhler s and péclet s numbers representing the adsorption and the ratio between transport and diffusion after plugging all these expressions into the eqs 12 15 using the chain rule of differentiation z i t x v t ε x ε ε 1 y x z i t x v t ε x ε δ z i t x v t ε x ε ε 2 δ y 2 ε div x y δ x z i t x v ε t x ε t z i t x v t ε x ε t v ε x z i t x v t ε x ε and equating the coefficients in front of the same powers of ε we get the following cascade of equations equation of order ε 2 39 γ mp δ y z 0 m pe f 0 γ mp v y y z 0 m

problem 39 is a spectral problem and we have to determine in the same time the eigenvalues r and corresponding eigenfunctions it is not a symmetric eigenvalue problem and it is not clear that there are eigenvalues notice that we are interested only in having a strictly positive r the following operator is linked to the eigenvalue problem 39 40 b σ ζ γ mp y mp y σ y ζ d y y w d w c d p d np eff y

the krein rutman theorem see e g dautray and lions 1999 according to this theorem there exists a simple positive eigenvalue λ 0 1 r of the operator b 1 with a positive corresponding eigenfunction ξ c

same geometries are used here for the unit cell problems at nanoscale and at microscale two geometries are considered namely a unit square with either a circular inclusion with radius 0 25 or with an elliptical inclusion the length of the semi minor axis of the elliptical inclusion is 0 125 and of the semi major axis 0 25 the inclination of the semi major axis with the x axis was set to 20 the porosity of the two domains is z n p z m p 0 804 in the isotropic case 0 901 in the non isotropic case the specific surface area of the circular nanoscale inclusion in the dimensional case is γ n p 2 π ℓ np 4 0 5 π ℓ np while the interface porosity of the circular microscale inclusion is γ m p 0 804 for the validation we simulate the time evolution of the microscale model on a geometry consisting of a repetition of n c 5 10 and 20 periodic cells in x direction varying the number of the periodic cells in the row allows to study the convergence with respect to ε since the length of the macroscale domain is fixed to the unit interval the length of the periodic cells is given by ℓ mp 1 n c 1 5 1 10 1 20 the periodic cells extend from ℓ mp 2 to ℓ mp 2 in y direction the macroscale problem in this case is just a 1d problem and it is solved on the interval 0 1 software and discretization the problems considered here were solved using the commercial software tool comsol multiphysics at version 5 1 the laminar flow model was used for the flow problem and the cell problems and the microscale reactive transport problems were solved using the coefficient form pde module of comsol multiphysics steady state problems were solved for the flow and for the cell problems the eigenvalue problems were solved using comsol multiphysics eigenvalue solver the discretization of the problems is based on galerkin finite element method the flow and transport equations were discretized using quadratic lagrange elements a very fine triangular mesh was generated in the 2d computational domain for the cell problems using the extremely fine mesh setting option a mesh convergence study was conducted and it was found that this grid is fine enough for our purposes the results from this study are not presented here for brevity flow simulation the reactant in the micropores is convected by a microscopic velocity v which is divergence free 1 periodic in the fast variable y and satisfies the no slip condition at the interfaces between the washcoat particles and the macropores we plot on fig 2 the computed velocity which we will use for the numerical examples on fig 3 we plot the streamlines and the pressure these are results from solving a stokes problem in the unit cell y 0 1 2 the characteristic velocity vc is given by 54 v c 1 y mp y mp v x d y solved

sensitivity of the effective transport parameters with respect to the cell reaction rate the cell problems were solved for amic 1 4 16 initial and boundary conditions all models are solved with periodic boundary conditions and with the following initial condition 55 c t 0 x cos 2 x π x 0 1 and in the simulation time t 0 tf the final time tf in both models is scaled with the typical reaction timescale tr hence the final time was chosen as t f t r 0 16 0 04 0 01 for nc 5 10 20 respectively convergence of the micro scale model to the filter wall scale membrane scale models recall that in the both considered cases p e f o 1 and p e f o 1 ε to find the homogenized model one needs to solve an eigenvalue problem for either ψ y or ξ y and ξ y respectively this also yields the reaction rate r from the solution of the above mentioned eigenvalue problem further on one has to solve the macroscale equation for either s t x or c x t where the upscaled coefficients are calculated according from the solutions of the respective cell problems in combination these results give the filter wall scale models as the leading terms in the expansions 16 and 38 to compare the microscale model with the filter wall scale model in the case p e o 1 we integrate the leading term in eq 16 over the unit cell in the fast variable to compute the first moment i e the mean of the microscopic concentration in the cell using eq 20 this yields 56 c e f f x t e r t ε 2 s 0 x y t e r t ε 2 ψ 1 s x t with the normalization ψ 1 1 γ m p y ψ y d y analogously for the case p e o ε 1 the filter scale solution was

similarly we compute the mean of the microscale model given by eqs 12 15 over each periodic cell 58 c x i t y 1 y i y i c x t d x where c solves the microscale problem yi is the ith periodic cell and xi is its center point to demonstrate the difference between the oscillating micro scale solution and the averaged solution of the homogenized model in the comparisons below the average of the microscale concentration was computed for each fast variable x along y lines across the periodic cell perpendicular to the flow direction 59 c y x t 1 ℓ mp ℓ mp 2 ℓ mp 2 c x y d y where in this case y is the y coordinate of the 2d computational domain a numerical error analysis was performed to evaluate the convergence of the upscaled equation to the average of the microscopic model depending on ε the results are presented in sections 3 3 and 3 4 below to this end l 2 norm of the differences between the above defined cell means of the microscale solution and the homogenized solution both taken at the centers of the periodic cells was computed the distance measures were computed as follows 60 d l 2 t 1 n c i c x i t y c e f f x i t 2 3 2 computing effective microscale parameter starting with nanoscale equations for the two specific cell geometries considered here we calculate the solution to the respective periodic auxiliary cell problem in order to obtain the effective diffusion tensor for the micro scale equations the solution of the auxilliary cell problem for the cylindrical and the elliptical inclusions are shown in fig 5 the respective effective diffusion tensor in this isotropic case is the diagonal matrix d np eff 0 671 i for the non isotropic case i e for the elliptical inclusion the following full tensor is obtained d np eff 0 8496 0 0376 0 0376 0 756 the effective diffusion coefficient d np eff computed for the cylindrical inclusion is then used in the microscale model as the diffusion coefficient in the washcoat particle 3 3 numerical homogenization results for the case of strong absorption o ε 2 and p e o 1 in this section we present a numerical study on the convergence of the solution of the microscale model 12 15 to the solution of the macroscale model 56 first the respective cell problems are solved at microscale in order to compute the effective coefficients for the macroscale model 20 26 next the macroscale model is solved with the upscaled coefficients and its y averaged solution is compared to the y averaged solution of the microscale problem the macroscale solution is compared also to vertically averaged microscale solution numerical solution of the cell problems for pe o 1 solution of the spectral problem 18 fig 6 shows the solutions for the spectral problem for the three values of acell for the cylindrical inclusion notably the adsorption in the washcoat leads to a minimum of the eigenfunction ψ in the inclusion which is more pronounced for higher values of acell as the eigenfunction represents a kind of equilibrium distribution of the solvent this means that for high reaction rates the solvent is concentrated outside the washcoat this in turn is due to the diffusion limitation of the transport of the solvent into the washcoat particle solutions of the cell problems 23 and 24 the effective diffusive tensor dpah and the transport velocity a t are calculated from the solutions of the cell problems 23 for wi and 24 for q solutions for the cylindrical geometry are presented here the numerical solutions to the cell problems are shown in fig 7 and fig 8 for the three different values of acell 1 4 16 while the cell problem 23 is a cell problem to compute the effective diffusion coefficient of a porous medium the cell problem 24 is a correction of the spectral problem for the convective transport in the pore space as we assume small convection the overall magnitude of q is much smaller than the overall magnitude of w effective transport parameters the diffusion matrix ah given by 27 the transport velocity a t and reaction coefficient a 0 given by 28 are computed from the solution of the cell problems and are summarized in table 2 as it can be seen the effective diffusion has a very small dependence on the microscopic reaction rate further the effective reaction rate r grows sublinearly with the reaction rate acell this again can be explained by the transport limitation of the solvent into the washcoat particle convergence of the pore scale model 12 15 to the filter wall scale membrane scale model 56 visual comparison for visual comparison the solutions of the filter scale model and the aforementioned averages were computed at six different moments in time corresponding to t 0 0 2tr 0 4tr 0 6tr 0 8tr tr figs 9 show the y averaged solutions of the filter wall scale model and an average of the micro scale model over the width of the domain c y x t illustrating the oscillations of the micro model around the filter scale model notably for t 0 the vertical average coincides with the macro model solution as both models have identical initial conditions also the microscale model shows oscillations around the filter wall scale model and while the period of the oscillation decreases with the number of periodicity cells n c ϵ 1 the amplitude does not further fig 10 shows the means over the unit cells in the micro model compared to the solution of the effective solution for the filter wall scale model noticeably despite from a small deviation at n c 5 the cell means are almost perfectly coinciding with the solution of the filter wall scale model this demonstrates that for the parameters used in this study already n c 10 gives good accuracy error analysis errors computated according to the error measure introduced in 60 are summarized in table 3 convergence with respect to ε can be observed it is seen that the error is very small of order of 10 3 and less due to the strong reaction the concentration for larger times goes fast to zero the error becomes of order 10 3 and less 3 4 results for the homogenization for strong absorption and p e o ε 1 here we verify the convergence of eqs 12 15 to 57 in the limit ϵ 0 for the same reaction parameters as in the previous section but for a larger injection velocity i e pe f ε 1 eigenvalue problems 42 and 43 and filter scale transport parameters as in the previous case the effective transport parameters have to be computed by solving the cell problems 42 and 43 however since the velocity does not vary macroscopically the mixing reaction rate amix vanishes and only the transport velocity v and the effective reaction rate r have to be computed from the corresponding cell problems i e the eigenvalue problem 42 and its adjoint problem 43 the cell problems for this case depend on ε not only through the reaction rate acell but also through the local péclet number pe f 0 pe f ε which has to be varied as well therefore we solve the eigenvalue problem for the three cases i ε 0 2 a 1 pe f 0 2 ii ε 0 1 a 4 pe f 0 1 and iii ε 0 05 a 16 pe f 0 0 5 the solutions to the spectral problems ξ and ξ are shown in fig 11 for three values of acell and pe f 0 in order to compute the microscopic diffusion dispersion tensor ah the cell problem 50 was solved for the same parameters the respective solutions for αx are shown in fig 12 effective transport parameters for the isotropic case the computed eigenvalue and effective transport velocities are summarized in table 4 it is apparent that the transport velocity v grows almost linearly with the péclet number p e f 0 but is virtually unaffected by the cell reaction rate acell while the effective reaction rate r grows almost linearly with the cell reaction rate but is unaffected by the péclet number the effective diffusion dispersion tensor ah remains almost constant over the entire parameter range convergence of the pore scale model 12 15 to the filter wall scale model 56 in order to test the convergence of the micro scale to the effective model we again compute the y averages and the averages c y x and c y i x i of the microscale model and compare with the solution of the filter wall scale model at six different points in time corresponding to t t 0 0 15 t r 0 3 t r 0 45 t r 0 6 t r 0 75 t r 0 9 t r the oscillating slice averages and the effective model solutions are shown in fig 13 visual comparison again from the vertical averaging it is clearly visible that the micro scale solution oscillates and that the oscillations do not decrease in amplitude for smaller ε also even for n c 5 periodicity cells the cell averages c y i x i shown in fig 14 a coinside very well with the values for the effective model this indicates a strong viability of the upscaling approach even for small values of the scale separation parameter ϵ error analysis errors computated according to the error measure introduced in 60 are summarized in table 5 convergence with respect to ε can be observed it is seen that the error is very small of order of 10 3 and less due to the strong reaction the concentration for larger times goes fast to zero the error becomes of order 10 3 and less 4 conclusion homogenization of reactive flow through catalytic membranes in the presence of strong absorption in the washcoat particles is studied in this paper as recognized earlier see e g battiato et al 2019 the standard homogenization approach does not work in the case when the reaction dominates both the diffusion and the convection to overcome this the derivation presented here is based on the approach involving auxiliary eigenvalue problem that allows to account for the exponential concentration decay two reactive transport regimes are studied in both the reaction dominates over the convection and the diffusion and respectively two different upscaled equations are rigorously derived direct numerical simulation at microscale is used to validate numerically the macroscale equations in the case of

388,catalytic membranes can degrade gaseous pollutants to clean gas via a catalytic reaction to achieve green emissions further a catalytic membrane is a three scale porous medium membranes used in catalytic filters usually have thicknesses of centimeters or millimeters and consist of active washcoat particles inert material and microscale micron size pores the washcoat particles are porous material with nanoscale pores the catalytic reactions are heterogeneous surface reactions and they occur on the surface of the nanopores obviously simulations at fully resolved pore scale are not feasible and upscaling techniques have to be applied it is known that the same microscale problem can be upscaled to different macroscale equations depending on the characteristic numbers in this paper we study the homogenization of reactive flow in the presence of strong absorption in the washcoat particles two reactive transport regimes are studied where in both the reaction dominates over the convection and the diffusion péclet s number in the first one is of order 1 and in the second one it is proportional to the ratio of the thickness of the catalytic membrane and the characteristic length of the microscale pores two different upscaled equations are obtained respectively direct numerical simulation at microscale is used to validate these derived macroscale equations keywords reactive flow catalytic filter homogenization validation 1 introduction particulate filters are a standard component of the exhaust purification system of diesel vehicles and recently they are also introduced for gasoline vehicles see e g yang et al 2018 current filters in automotive catalysis use honeycomb monolith structures see e g fig 1 with a large number of parallel channels that are alternatingly connected to the inlet and to the outlet so that the gas is forced through the walls membranes and the soot is deposited inside or on top of the wall membrane current exhaust systems contain several different catalysts for the removal of nox co and unburned hydrocarbons there is a strong interest to integrate some of the catalytic functionality into the particulate filter as such multifunctional catalytic filters allow to reduce the number of components of the exhaust system the resulting more compact exhaust systems are advantageous in terms of weight space requirements and cost and allow faster heat up during vehicle cold start in diesel vehicles mostly the diesel oxidation catalyst functionality or the selective catalytic reduction scr functionality have been integrated in the particulate filter for gasoline vehicles particulate filters with integrated three way catalytic functionality have been developed since these devices simultaneously remove co hydrocarbons no and soot they are also called four way catalysts the focus of our study is the usage of catalytic membranes for gas cleaning and more precisely the modeling of the processes within such membrane in the case when the reaction dominates the diffusion and the convection for discussion on modeling and simulation of particulate filters we refer to iliev et al 2015 for simulation of reactive flow in 3d ct image geometries we refer e g to iliev lakdawala nessler prill vutov yang and yao 2017 and greiner robert prill iliev van setten and votsmeier 2019 due to their importance for industry catalytic membranes have become a subject of intensive studies in particular in the area of modeling and simulation of these processes the thickness of the catalytic membranes is usually of millimeter or centimeter size the membranes are intrinsic multiscale consisting of inert matrix micron size pores and washcoat active particles the latter being nanoscale porous catalytic filters or catalytic reactors which may have decimeter or meter size are on a bigger scale membranes serve as walls of the channels from which a catalytic filter is built therefore within this paper sometimes the word wall is also used in the sense of membrane despite the importance of the catalytic filters and the achievements in developing new more active washcoat there is a lack of rigorous mathematical knowledge for the performance of these advanced washcoats for which the reaction can dominate the diffusion and or convection we observe that the industry is still broadly using heuristically derived models or models derived for the diffusion dominated reactive transport regimes in many cases such models are postulated using the large experimental knowledge and the similarity with other processes obviously such models have been validated often after calibration for many particular regimes and have played an important role in the design and optimization of catalytic filters special software tools like detchem www detchem com have been developed based on such models and general purpose software tools like comsol multiphysics www comsol com and fluent www fluent com have been used to solve some of these models simulation of processes in catalytic filters is discussed e g in inderwildi and richard 2005 pereira et al 2014 yang et al 2016 wang et al 2019 hettel et al 2019 to name just a few papers however as discussed many times in the literature in connection with different application areas see e g the discussion on page 1 in davit et al 2010 the problems with the heuristic models are that the conditions and the parameter range of their validity is not clearly determined a short discussion on the upscaling methods for reactive flows in porous media will be useful for understanding the focus and the novelty of this paper the main approaches for upscaling are asymptotic homogenization and volume averaging for a comprehensive discussion on these as well as on other upscaling approaches in conjunctions with porous media we refer to the recent overview paper battiato et al 2019 see also references therein advantages and disadvantages of the presented upscaling approaches are discussed there and what is very important and useful the area of applicability of the these methods and regimes is discussed as well for general discussions on homogenization we refer e g to sánchez palencia 1980 jikov et al 1994 hornung 1997 mei and vernescu 2010 and bakhvalov et al 2012 in particular upscaling from the single phase stokes problem to the darcy problem is discussed e g in the chapter allaire 1997 by allaire in hornung 1997 the reactive flows are characterized by an interplay between convection diffusion reaction and pore scale morphology asymptotic homogenization for reactive flows at the earlier period was limited to the diffusion dominated case a general homogenization result on this approach in conjunction with surface heterogeneous reaction can be found e g in hornung and jäger 1991 so called cell problems in terms of pdes are defined in the papers mentioned above and their solution need to be post processed in order to compute the effective coefficients for the macroscale upscaled equation note that the homogenization section in battiato et al 2019 emphasizes and states that the standard homogenization approaches do not work for the reaction dominated case see also battiato tartakovsky tartakovsky and scheibe 2009 and boso and battiato 2013 but they do not elaborate on the advanced homogenization approaches which we shortly discuss below more challenging is the upscaling in the case of dominant convection and or reaction which is the case of large péclet and or damköhler number recall that large péclet number indicates that the convection dominates the diffusion and large damköhler number of first kind indicates that the reaction dominates the diffusion such problems were first considered in the study of dispersion in porous media for large péclet numbers and non zero drift classical two scale expansions lead either to systems of equations without solution or to low order precision hyperbolic models the difficulty was solved by auriault and adler 1995 where two different time scales were introduced and by mauri rubinstein who included higher order terms in the expansion in rubinstein and mauri 1986 mauri 1991 if the model contains also the reaction terms with a high damköhler number reaction dominated problems then the problem becomes even more complicated in papanicolaou 1995 the effective drift was taken as a part of the two scale expansion and it allowed for a successful study of dispersion effects the approach was further developed in works of marušić paloka and piatnitski 2005 and allaire and raphael 2007 the presence of a large drift was handled by introducing a drift in the expansion and a large bulk reaction terms lead to an exponential decay linked to an eigenvalue problem the idea was applied to the reaction diffusion systems in porous media with surface reactions by allaire et al 2010a and allaire et al 2010b the case of diffusion and reactions was studied in allaire and piatnitski 2010 models involving also a surface diffusion were studied by allaire and hutridurga 2015 and allaire and hutridurga 2016 it should be remarked that in addition to the pdes based cell problems needed to calculate the effective coefficients in this case an auxiliary eigenvalue problem is derived on the periodicity cell and its solution is needed to account for the exponential concentration decay caused by the high damköhler number note that the formulation of an eigenvalue problem in order to account for the exponential decay was known before adopting it in the context of homogenization e g see the one dimensional analysis for time periodic reactive flows in shapiro and brenner 1987 and its extension to two dimensional arrays in edwards et al 1993 the last two papers unlike all other papers cited here are formulated with respect to probability density functions for more details on the history of this ansatz we refer to the literature in the above mentioned homogenization papers an important conclusion can be drawn based on the above papers namely even starting from the same microscale problem for different sizes of the characteristic numbers the homogenization results in different upscaled macroscale model depending on the considered regime different here means that these can be different types of equations which cannot be converted to each other by simple fitting of the coefficients for examples the drift term in the case of dominant convection and the term with the exponential decay of the concentration in the case of large damköhler number are not present in the basic convection diffusion reaction equation derived for the diffusion dominated case and their effects can not be accounted for by tuning the coefficients in this basic equation this already implies that trying just to fit the coefficients in a heuristically postulated equation is an approach which does not lead to predictive modeling and in particular does not highlight the area of validity of a heuristic model it should be noted that the literature on homogenization of reactive flow in conjunctions with catalytic filters is very scarce in hornung and jäger 1991 hornung et al 1994 conca et al 2003 2004 díaz et al 2016 the authors consider this problem but they neglect the convection and consider only diffusion a reaction equation also the regimes they discuss differ from regimes which are considered in this paper the literature on the theory and application of the method of volume averaging mva in conjunction with multiscale passive and active transport in porous media is very rich basic references are e g whitaker 2013 slattery 1999 bear and bachmat 2012 while at the early stages of the mva developments the closures needed to separate the scales were based on a number of assumptions the predictivity of mva was significantly increased after the rigorous derivation of pdes based auxilliary problems for the closure variables note that there is conceptual similarity between these closure problems and the cell problems derived in the homogenization in both cases local problems at the microscale are solved in order to compute the effective coefficients for the macroscale model as a part of a scale separation algorithm although the closure problems are discussed in the context of periodic media applicability of the derived in this way volume averaged macroscale models to problems in random porous media is justified in several papers for discussion on the derivation of the closure problems we refer to e g quintard and whitaker 2005 wood et al 2007 quintard and whitaker 1998 valdés parada lasseux and whitaker 2019 see also the respective section and the references in the recent overview battiato et al 2019 the use of pdes based closure problems for computing corrections deviations in mva is useful in investigating the impact of the reaction on the effective diffusivity and on the effective reaction rate a validation of the derived macroscale models by comparison with the solution of the respective microscale problem is available but only for the diffusion reaction problems i e in absence of convection see e g valdés parada et al 2017 these papers however consider the diffusion dominated case called also mixing controlled case i e the cases da 1 and in few cases da 1 the catalysis has attracted the attention of the volume averaging community and below we mention selectively several papers which deal with it thorough discussion on volume averaging in absence of convection i e diffusion reaction model in catalytic pellets is presented in the early paper ryan et al 1981 closure equations are proposed and different regimes are discussed unlike our case ideal gas under constant pressure is considered there in whitaker 1987 the analysis is extended to develop a general relation for all the molar fluxes in an n component system in de souza and whitaker 2003 authors consider catalytic porous bed reactor elaborate on the dispersion in the fluid phase in the case of periodic media present closure problems under clearly defined length scale constraints and provide expressions for the effective coefficients the important question when the reaction influences the effective diffusivity is discussed e g in valdés parada and alvarez ramirez 2010 valdés parada and aguilar madera 2011 the respective closure problems are solved for a range of thiele modulus proportional to damköhler number for several periodic geometries and the presented plots give quantitative answer on the studied question the solution of the closure problems and calculations of the effective parameters in periodic and in random porous media is a part of the recent paper valdés parada aguilar madera 2011 valdés parada lasseux whitaker 2017 in the latter the volume averaged macroscale models for catalytic reactions in the presence of diffusive transport no convection were revisited and expansion with respect to thiele modulus was used to analyze them for thiele modulus going up to one recall that the analysis earlier was presented only for thiele modulus being much smaller than unity an interesting part of the paper is the validation of the upscaled model in comparison with direct numerical simulation of the microscale problem under steady and transient conditions study of dispersion in porous media with large péclet numbers using the volume averaging is also one of the favorite research field of michel quintard he wrote several seminal papers on the problem and contributed on essential way to our understanding of the phenomenon see e g quintard and whitaker 1993 and quintard and whitaker 2005 the goal of this paper is to present a rigorous derivation of the upscaled model of the reactive flow through catalytic membranes which are the essential component of the catalytic filters for the regime of strong absorption within the washcoat particles the ratio between the characteristic size of the micropores and thickness of the membrane denoted by ε is a small number we consider reaction dominated problems with the absorption in the washcoat particles being of order of o ε 2 for the transport through the membrane we consider either weak or moderate convection p e f o 1 and p e f o ε 1 and apply the ansatz from allaire and raphael 2007 to derive the homogenized models in addition we compute the effective coefficients and validate the derived upscaled model through a comparison with the full solution of the microscale problem up to our knowledge the regimes with dominating absorption which are considered here are rigorously discussed neither in homogenization nor in volume averaging literature we are also not aware of using direct numerical simulation at microscale for validation of derived macroscale equations in conjunction with considered here regimes the reminder of the paper is organized as follows section 2 is dedicated to the derivation of upscaled equations for strong absorption in the washcoat particles and two flow regimes namely p e f o 1 and p e f o ε 1 section 3 deals with the validation of the derived upscaled equations by means of comparison of their solution with the solution of the microscale problems 2 upscaling of transport in presence of adsorption the membranes used in catalytic filters are three scale porous media they consist of active washcoat particles inert material and microscale pores the washcoat particles are porous material with nanoscale pores the inert material is ignored here because it does not play a role in the adsorption process a sketch of the three scale geometry is presented in fig 1 the characteristic length of the nanopores is denoted by ℓ np the characteristic length of the micropores is denoted by ℓ mp and finally the characteristic length at macroscale catalytic membrane thickness is l we suppose ℓ np ℓ mp l for the sake of simplicity we concentrate on the following strict separation of scales ℓ np ℓ mp δ 1 ℓ mp l ε 1 also we suppose rigid solid grains 2 1 the geometry we start by introducing the nanoporous domain ω w its geometry is based on the dimensionless unit periodicity cell z 0 1 n on which we consider a smooth partition zs z np where zs is the solid part and z np is the pore space its periodic extension is a smooth connected open subset γnp is the internal boundary between z np and zs the dimensionless pore space is ω np j z n ℓ np ℓ mp z np j and the dimensionless total reactive surface is b np j z n ℓ np ℓ mp γ np j it is supposed that the ratio between the characteristic micropores length ℓ mp and the nanopores length ℓ np of the periodic structure is always a natural number the finite union of all unit cells dilated by ℓ np ℓ mp gives a parallelepiped ω w r n n 2 3 with a characteristic length ℓ mp ℓ np containing a periodic arrangement of solid particles with reactive surface the dimensional nanoporous domain ω w is obtained after a dilatation of ω w by a scale factor ℓ mp ω np and b np are obtained analogously next we introduce the membrane macroscale domain which has micro scale porosity for simplicity we suppose that the macroscale domain ω is a parallelepiped consisting of a periodic structure in r n n 2 3 it is supposed that the ratio between the characteristic length l of the parallelepiped and the length ℓ mp of the periodic structure is always a natural number the unit periodicity cell is y 0 1 n on which we consider a smooth partition yw y mp where yw is the washcoat particle considered as effective averaged media and y mp is the pore space γmp is the interface between yw and y mp by periodic translations we obtain the domain occupied by the microscale pores ω mp j z n j k l ℓ mp ℓ mp y mp j and the domain occupied by washcoat particles ω w j z n j k l ℓ mp ℓ mp y w j the interface between the micropores and the averaged washcoat particles is denoted by b mp j z n j k l ℓ mp ℓ mp γ mp j further on ω w ω w ℓ mp ω mp ω mp ℓ mp and b mp b mp ℓ mp remark 1 in this article we perform two successive homogenizations the first one is undertaken in the washcoat particles which are porous media themselves containing the nanopores after obtaining the homogenized model in the washcoat particles we undertake the second homogenization in the membrane consisting of the micro pores and the washcoat grains an alternative is to average using the three scale expansion the obtained homogenized models have similarity but differ in general particularly at the interfaces which motivated us to introduce an additional parameter γmp in section 2 4 the used notations are summarized in table 1 note that subscript np indicates values or functions within nanopores the subscript mp indicated values or functions within microscale pores subscript w indicates values or functions defined in the averaged washcoat particles throughout the paper bar is used for denoting the dimensional variables while no bar is used for the dimensionless variables the permeability of the nanoporous particles is of order o ℓ np 2 and the advection velocity of the solute there is negligible with respect to the diffusion and the reaction only the diffusion and adsorption effects are important within the washcoat particles it is assumed that fick s law is applicable and furthermore a first order linear adsorption model is considered in this paper the model for the evolution of the concentration c at nano scale is given by 1 c t div x d p x c 0 in ω np 2 ν d p x c k α c on b np where ν is the outward unit normal as it is common in homogenization derivations periodic boundary conditions are imposed it should be noted that the derived upscaled equations are valid also for other types of boundary conditions 2 2 dimensionless form of the model in the nanoscale pores within washcoat particles let v c be the characteristic transport velocity in the membrane and let d p d p d np d mp be the characteristic value of the diffusion coefficient in the micropores and in the nanopores without lack of generality considered to be the same k α is the adsorption coefficient on the nanopores walls two characteristic time scales are introduced 1 t t l v c the transport time at macroscale 2 t d ℓ mp 2 d p the diffusion time in the nanopores next we set 1 pe f l v c d p péclet s number at

have supposed that the ratio td tads is small with respect to one we choose the diffusion time as a characteristic time and the adsorption effects will be captured with this choice hence we set y x ℓ

particles problem 4 5 is upscaled using the method of two scale asymptotic expansions see e g papanicolaou 1995 the homogenized dimensionless equation reads as follows 6 z np c w t da np δ 1 γ np c w div y d np eff y c w in ω w the homogenized diffusion matrix d np eff is symmetric positive definite and is calculated from the solution of the so called cell problem notice that the size of coefficients in front of the time derivative and in front of the effective adsorption term explains the fast decay of the concentration within the washcoat particles observed in section 5 of greiner et al 2019 the dimensional effective eq 7 in the washcoat particles is obtained from the dimensionless eq 6 by returning to the dimensional variables in ω w 7 z np c w t γ np k α ℓ np c w div x d p d

describing convection diffusion and absorption at microscale next we homogenize the microscale problem posed at the level of the averaged effective washcoat particles and the microscale pores between them on the interface between the washcoat particles and the microscale pores b mp we consider perfect contact i e continuity of the normal component of the mass flux and continuity of the concentration effects like interfacial accumulation mass transfer resistance i e discontinuity of the concentration and or the normal component of the mass flux surface diffusion deformation are not considered here thus in the microscale pores ω mp and on the interfaces between micropores and the effective washcoat particles we consider the following problem 8 c mp t v x c mp div x d p x c mp 0 in ω mp 9 ν γ mp d p x c mp ν d p d np eff x c np on b mp 10 c mp c np on b mp γmp is the interface porosity we suppose that the flow is incompressible at the micropores level and negligible in the nanopores i e 11 div y v t x y 0 in ω mp and we set v t x y 0 for y b mp and y ω w we recall that the solute reactive diffusion in the washcoat particles ω w is given by the effective homogenized averaged eq 7 and that the velocity is calculated separately by solving the stokes or navier stokes equations in ω mp with the no slip condition for it at b mp in the membrane we choose the diffusion time t d l 2 d p as characteristic time hence we set x x l v t x x ℓ mp v c v t x x ε c x t c x t and t t d t l 2 d p t recall that the dimensional variables are denoted bar the dimensionless form of the system 8 10 is 12 γ mp c mp t pe f v x c mp γ mp δ x c mp 0 in ω mp 13 ν γ mp x c mp ν d np eff x c np on b mp 14 c mp c np on b mp and the dimensionless form of the eq 7 is now rewritten with the new time and space scaling it is written not only in one washcoat particle zw but also in the domain occupying all washcoat particles namely ω w 15 z np c w t γ np k α l 2 d p ℓ np o ε 2 c w div x d

3 namely da np o δ we complete the explanation it is known that the homogenization of the system 12 14 15 depends on the size of the characteristic numbers and their ratios so that different upscaled equations are obtained depending on those numbers below we will consider the case of strong absorption rate once with moderate p e f o 1 convection and once with stronger convection p e f o ε 1 2 5 homogenization of the microscale equations in the case strong absorption and convection p e f o 1 in this subsection we concentrate to the case k α l 2 d p ℓ np o ε 2 and pe f o 1 the case pe f o ε 1 is of interest for larger injection velocities and we consider it in section 2 7 in difference to the homogenization in the nanopores here we follow allaire and raphael 2007 and allaire et al 2010a and start with a new two scale ansatz 16 s t x e r t ε 2 i 0 ε i s i t x x ε where s t x c mp t x in ω mp c w t x in ω w si is y periodic in y the fast variable at this scale is denoted by y x ε note that this notation is local and the y here should not be mixed with the y which was used locally in the previous subsection the factor r in the above expansion is the unknown effective adsorption rate the motivation for seeking the solution in this form comes from the presence of a strong bulk reaction term within the washcoat particles originating from adsorption in the nanopores and the fact that in this case a standard two scale expansion like the one in the previous section would lead to equations with no solution after plugging all these expressions into the eqs 12 15 and equating the coefficients in front of the same powers of ε we get the following cascade of equations equation of order ε 2 17 γ mp δ y c 0 m r γ mp c 0 m in y mp γ mp y c 0 m ν d np eff y c 0 n ν and c 0 m c 0 n

summarize the upscaled dimensionless equations as usual in the expansion 16 only the zeroth order term namely s 0 is considered unlike typical upscaling problems the zeroth order term here still depends on both fast y and slow x variables the advantage with respect to the full microscale problem is that the fast and slow variables terms separate see 20 which makes the solution of the upscaled problem much simpler compared to the solution of the microscale problem to find s 0 20 one needs to solve in a periodic cell the eigenvalue problem 18 for ψ y and macroscale eq 26 for s t x the upscaled coefficients in 26 are calculated according to 27 29 from the solutions of the cell problems 23 24 to complete the solution procedure according to 16 one also needs to obtain the reaction rate r which is the smallest eigenvalue of the above mentioned eigenvalue problem 18 conclusion 3 in many cases only the averaged solution is needed at macroscale in such cases we can integrate 20 over y with respect to y to introduce 30 s eff t x y mp ψ y s t x d y y w ψ y s t x d y y ψ y d y s t x recall that s t x satisfies 26 such averaging is used in the section on numerical validation when comparing the solutions of the microscale and of the macroscale problems conclusion 4 note that the dependence from the fast variable may be eliminated if a weighted mean is considered i e we can multiply 20 by ψ y and integrate thus introducing 31 s eff t x γ mp y mp ψ 2 y s t x d y z np y w ψ 2 y s t x d y having in mind that ψ y was normalized 19 we get 32 s eff t x s t x recall that s t x satisfies 26 conclusion 5 in the regime under consideration of strong adsorption k α l 2 d p ℓ p o ε 2 and with moderate advection p e f o 1 the effective dimensional homogenized equation for the solute concentration c eff reads 33 c eff t x e r t d p ℓ mp 2 ψ x ε s eff t x where s eff solves the equation 34 s eff t d p l a t x s eff d p a 0 l 2 s eff div x d p a h x s eff in ω and ψ and r are given by the spectral problem 18 r gives the effective adsorption rate and ψ can be interpreted as a local equilibrium profile between diffusion and adsorption the adsorption affects through ψ the effective transport velocity d p l a t the effective reaction coefficient d p a 0 l 2 and the effective diffusion tensor dpah 2 6 properties of the effective diffusion matrix ah hence the homogenization approach gave eq 26 as the effective dimensionless equation it is important to prove that the effective diffusion matrix ah is symmetric positive definite formula 27 is not well adapted for establishing this property in this direction we recall that the eigenfunction ψ computed by solving spectral problem 18 is strictly positive hence function ξ i w i ψ i 1 n is well defined we insert w i ψ ξ i i 1 n into system 23 and multiply the resulting system by ψζ ζ h p e r 1 y using the spectral problem 18 gives 35 γ mp y ψ 2 ζ y ξ i m γ mp ψ 2 y ξ i m y ζ 2 γ mp ζ ψ ψ y i in y mp γ

matrix ah is symmetric and positive definite 2 7 homogenization of the microscale equations in the case of strong absorption and p e o ε 1 in this subsection we suppose a larger filtration velocity

follow allaire and raphael 2007 and allaire et al 2010a and start with a two scale with drift ansatz now it has to contain also a decay 38 c p t x e r t ε 2 i 0 ε i z i t x v ε x ε where c p t x c mp t x in ω mp c w t x in ω w zi is y periodic in y for every i and v is a constant drift velocity to be determined as in section 2 5 its fast variable here is denoted by y x ε the factor and r is the unknown effective adsorption rate motivation comes from the presence of large damköhler s and péclet s numbers representing the adsorption and the ratio between transport and diffusion after plugging all these expressions into the eqs 12 15 using the chain rule of differentiation z i t x v t ε x ε ε 1 y x z i t x v t ε x ε δ z i t x v t ε x ε ε 2 δ y 2 ε div x y δ x z i t x v ε t x ε t z i t x v t ε x ε t v ε x z i t x v t ε x ε and equating the coefficients in front of the same powers of ε we get the following cascade of equations equation of order ε 2 39 γ mp δ y z 0 m pe f 0 γ mp v y y z 0 m

problem 39 is a spectral problem and we have to determine in the same time the eigenvalues r and corresponding eigenfunctions it is not a symmetric eigenvalue problem and it is not clear that there are eigenvalues notice that we are interested only in having a strictly positive r the following operator is linked to the eigenvalue problem 39 40 b σ ζ γ mp y mp y σ y ζ d y y w d w c d p d np eff y

y furthermore b 1 is positive in the sense that for f y 0 we have b 1 f y 0 on y and if f y 0 on y then 0 c 1 min y f b 1 f y c 2 min y f hence b 1 is also 1 bounded now we are in situation to apply the krein rutman theorem see e g dautray and lions 1999 according to this theorem there exists a simple positive eigenvalue λ 0 1 r of the operator b 1 with a positive corresponding eigenfunction ξ c

numerically studied this section is organized as follows in the first subsection preliminaries are discussed namely geometries grids discretization used software equations to be solved and parameters for them in the second subsection the upscaling from nanoscale to microscale i e from nanoporous washcoat particles to averaged washcoat particles is shortly discussed in the third subsection validation of the upscaling from microscale to macroscale for strong absorption in the washcoat particles o ϵ 2 and p e f o 1 is presented and finally in the fourth subsection validation for upscaling

same geometries are used here for the unit cell problems at nanoscale and at microscale two geometries are considered namely a unit square with either a circular inclusion with radius 0 25 or with an elliptical inclusion the length of the semi minor axis of the elliptical inclusion is 0 125 and of the semi major axis 0 25 the inclination of the semi major axis with the x axis was set to 20 the porosity of the two domains is z n p z m p 0 804 in the isotropic case 0 901 in the non isotropic case the specific surface area of the circular nanoscale inclusion in the dimensional case is γ n p 2 π ℓ np 4 0 5 π ℓ np while the interface porosity of the circular microscale inclusion is γ m p 0 804 for the validation we simulate the time evolution of the microscale model on a geometry consisting of a repetition of n c 5 10 and 20 periodic cells in x direction varying the number of the periodic cells in the row allows to study the convergence with respect to ε since the length of the macroscale domain is fixed to the unit interval the length of the periodic cells is given by ℓ mp 1 n c 1 5 1 10 1 20 the periodic cells extend from ℓ mp 2 to ℓ mp 2 in y direction the macroscale

the problems is based on galerkin finite element method the flow and transport equations were discretized using quadratic lagrange elements a very fine triangular mesh was generated in the 2d computational domain for the cell problems using the extremely fine mesh setting option a mesh convergence study was conducted and it was found that this grid is fine enough for our purposes the results from this study are not presented here for brevity flow simulation the reactant in the micropores is convected by a microscopic velocity v which is divergence free 1 periodic in the fast

periodic boundary conditions and with the following initial condition 55 c t 0 x cos 2 x π x 0 1 and in the simulation time t 0 tf the final time tf in both models is scaled with the typical reaction timescale tr hence the final time was chosen as t f t r 0 16 0 04 0 01 for nc 5 10 20 respectively convergence of the micro scale model to the filter wall scale membrane scale models recall that in the both considered cases p e f o 1 and p e f o 1 ε to find the homogenized model one needs to solve an eigenvalue problem for either ψ y or ξ y and ξ y respectively this also yields the reaction rate r from the solution of the above mentioned eigenvalue problem further on one has to solve the macroscale equation for either s t x or c x t where the upscaled coefficients are calculated according from the solutions of the respective cell problems in combination these results give the filter wall scale models as the leading terms in the expansions 16 and 38 to compare the microscale model with the filter wall scale model in the case p e o 1 we integrate the leading term in eq 16 over the unit cell in the fast variable to compute the first moment i e the mean of the microscopic concentration in the cell using eq 20 this yields 56 c e f f x t e r t ε 2 s 0 x y t e r t ε 2 ψ 1 s x t with the normalization ψ 1 1 γ m p y ψ y d y analogously for the case p e o ε 1 the filter scale solution was

similarly we compute the mean of the microscale model given by eqs 12 15 over each periodic cell 58 c x i t y 1 y i y i c x t d x where c solves the microscale problem yi is the ith periodic cell and xi is its center point to demonstrate the difference between the oscillating micro scale solution and the averaged solution of the homogenized model in the comparisons below the average of the

nanoscale equations for the two specific cell geometries considered here we calculate the solution to the respective periodic auxiliary cell problem in order to obtain the effective diffusion tensor for the micro scale equations the solution of the auxilliary cell problem for the cylindrical and the elliptical inclusions are shown in fig 5 the respective effective diffusion tensor in this isotropic case is the diagonal matrix d np eff 0 671 i for the non isotropic case i e for the elliptical inclusion the following full tensor is obtained d np eff 0 8496 0 0376 0 0376 0 756 the effective diffusion coefficient d np eff computed for the cylindrical inclusion is then used in the microscale model as the diffusion coefficient in the washcoat particle 3 3 numerical homogenization results for the case of strong absorption o ε 2 and p e o 1 in this section we present a numerical study on the convergence of the solution of the microscale model 12 15 to the solution of the macroscale model 56 first the respective cell problems are solved at microscale in order to compute the effective coefficients for the macroscale model 20 26 next the macroscale model is solved with the upscaled coefficients and its y averaged solution is compared to the y averaged solution of the microscale problem the macroscale solution is compared also to vertically averaged microscale solution numerical solution of the cell problems for pe o 1 solution of the spectral problem 18 fig 6 shows the solutions for the spectral problem for the three values of acell for the cylindrical inclusion notably the adsorption in the washcoat leads to a minimum of the eigenfunction ψ in the inclusion which is more pronounced for higher values of acell as the eigenfunction represents a kind of equilibrium distribution of the solvent this means that for high reaction rates the solvent is concentrated outside the washcoat this in turn is due to the diffusion limitation of the transport of the solvent into the washcoat particle solutions of the cell problems 23 and 24 the effective diffusive tensor dpah and the transport velocity a t are calculated from the solutions of the cell problems 23 for wi and 24 for q solutions for the cylindrical geometry are presented here the numerical solutions to the cell problems are shown in fig 7 and fig 8 for the three different values of acell 1 4 16 while the cell problem 23 is a cell problem to compute the effective diffusion coefficient of a porous medium the cell problem 24 is a correction of the spectral problem for the convective transport in the pore space as we assume small convection the overall magnitude of q is much smaller than the overall magnitude of w effective transport parameters the diffusion matrix ah given by 27 the transport velocity a t and reaction coefficient a 0 given by 28 are computed from the solution of the cell problems and are summarized in table 2 as it can be seen the effective diffusion has a very small dependence on the microscopic reaction rate further the effective reaction rate r grows sublinearly with the reaction rate acell this again can be explained by the transport limitation of the solvent into the washcoat particle convergence of the pore scale model 12 15 to the filter wall scale membrane scale model 56 visual comparison for visual comparison the solutions of the filter scale model and the aforementioned averages were computed at six different moments in time corresponding to t 0 0 2tr 0 4tr 0 6tr 0 8tr tr figs 9 show the y averaged solutions of the filter wall scale model and an average of the micro scale model over the width of the domain c y x t illustrating the oscillations of the micro model around the filter scale model notably for t 0 the vertical average coincides with the macro model solution as both models have identical initial conditions also the microscale model shows oscillations around the filter wall scale model and while the period of the oscillation decreases with the number of periodicity cells n c ϵ 1 the amplitude does not further fig 10 shows the means over the unit cells in the micro model compared to the solution of the effective solution for the filter wall scale model noticeably despite from a small deviation at n c 5 the cell means are almost perfectly coinciding with the solution of the filter wall scale model this demonstrates that for the parameters used in this study already n c 10 gives good accuracy error analysis errors computated according to the error measure introduced in 60 are summarized in table 3 convergence with respect to ε can be observed it is seen that the error is very small of order of 10 3 and less due to the strong reaction the concentration for larger times goes fast to zero the error becomes of order 10 3 and less 3 4 results for the homogenization for strong absorption and p e o ε 1 here we verify the convergence of eqs 12 15 to 57 in the limit ϵ 0 for the same reaction parameters as in the previous section but for a larger injection velocity i e pe f ε 1 eigenvalue problems 42 and 43 and filter scale transport parameters as in the previous case the effective transport parameters have to be computed by solving the cell problems 42 and 43 however since the velocity does not vary macroscopically the mixing reaction rate amix vanishes and only the transport velocity v and the effective reaction rate r have to be computed from the corresponding cell problems i e the eigenvalue problem 42 and its adjoint problem 43 the cell problems for this case depend on ε not only through the reaction rate acell but also through the local péclet number pe f 0 pe f ε which has to be varied as well therefore we solve the eigenvalue problem for the three cases i ε 0 2 a 1 pe f 0 2 ii ε 0 1 a 4 pe f 0 1 and iii ε 0 05 a 16 pe f 0 0 5 the solutions to the spectral problems ξ and ξ are shown in fig 11 for three values of acell and pe f 0 in order to compute the microscopic diffusion dispersion tensor ah the cell problem 50 was solved for the same parameters the respective solutions for αx are shown in fig 12 effective transport parameters for the isotropic case the computed eigenvalue and effective transport velocities are summarized in table 4 it is apparent that the transport velocity v grows almost linearly with the péclet number p e f 0 but is virtually unaffected by the cell reaction rate acell while the effective reaction rate r grows almost linearly with the cell reaction rate but is unaffected by the péclet number the effective diffusion dispersion tensor ah remains almost constant over the entire parameter range convergence of the pore scale model 12 15 to the filter wall scale model 56 in order to test the convergence of the micro scale to the effective model we again compute the y averages and the averages c y x and c y i x i of the microscale model and compare with the solution of the filter wall scale model at six different points in time corresponding to t t 0 0 15 t r 0 3 t r 0 45 t r 0 6 t r 0 75 t r 0 9 t r the oscillating slice averages and the effective model solutions are shown in fig 13 visual comparison again from the vertical averaging it is clearly visible that the micro scale solution oscillates and that the oscillations do not decrease in amplitude for smaller ε also even for n c 5 periodicity cells the cell averages c y i x i shown in fig 14 a coinside very well with the values for the effective model this indicates a strong viability of the upscaling approach even for small values of the scale separation parameter ϵ error analysis errors computated according to the error measure introduced in 60 are summarized in table 5 convergence with respect to ε can be observed it is seen that the error is very small of order of 10 3 and less due to the strong reaction the concentration for larger times goes fast to zero the error becomes of order 10 3 and less 4 conclusion homogenization of reactive flow through catalytic membranes in the presence of strong absorption in the washcoat particles is studied in this paper as recognized earlier see e g battiato et al 2019 the standard homogenization approach does not work in the case when the reaction dominates both the diffusion and the convection to overcome this the derivation presented here is based on the approach involving auxiliary eigenvalue problem that allows to account for the exponential concentration decay two reactive transport regimes are studied in both the reaction dominates over the convection and the diffusion and respectively two different upscaled equations are rigorously derived direct numerical simulation at microscale is used to validate numerically the macroscale equations in the case of

389,this article shows how to consistently and accurately manage the lagrangian formulation of chemical reaction equations coupled with the superficial velocity formalism introduced in the late 80s by quintard and whitaker lagrangian methods prove very helpful in problems in which transport effects are strong or dominant but they need to be periodically put back in a regular lattice a process called remeshing in the context of digital rock physics we need to ensure positive concentrations and regularity to accurately handle stagnation point neighborhoods these two conditions lead to the use of kernels resulting in extra diffusion which can be prohibitively high when the diffusion coefficient is small this is the case especially for reactive porous media and the phenomenon is reinforced in porous rock matrices due to archie s law this article shows how to overcome this difficulty in the context of a two scale porosity model applied in the darcy brinkman stokes equations and how to obtain simultaneous sign preservation regularity and accurate diffusion and apply it to dissolution processes at the pore scale of actual rocks keywords three dimensional flows digital rock physics reactive flows dissolution process lagrangian methods porous media 1 introduction dissolution processes at pore scale play a crucial role in a wide range of applications for example mineral dissolution alters the hydraulic conductivity of soils wissmeier and barry 2009 and calcite dissolution in seawater is a key mechanism affecting the global carbon budget of the planet naviaux et al 2019 several emerging technologies rely on an in depth understanding of dissolution mechanisms such as the storage of natural gas in underground caverns located in deep salt domes bayram and bektasoglu 2020 the assessment of the long term storage capacity of co2 in carbonate formations hao et al 2019 singh et al 2018 and the chemical stimulation of geothermal reservoirs lucas et al 2020 other industrial processes such as water desalination also rely on the dissolution of caco3 lehmann et al 2013 the modeling of reactive transport and dissolution at pore scale is currently still a challenge in the context of co2 sequestration liu et al 2019 highlighted the need to develop numerical schemes meeting requirements of stability and convergence as well as local mass conservation and minimal numerical diffusion steefel et al 2005 advocated for the use of reactive transport models in earth sciences yet stressed that capturing the scale dependence of reactive transport processes is a challenge yet to be overcome as a concrete example of this scale dependence we can cite the work of gray et al 2018 confronting experimental results with simulations of calcite dissolution in hcl showed that small morphological features such as pore throat size micro porosity and specific reactive area could have a significant impact on the reaction rates and the dissolution patterns obtained li et al 2006 focused their attention on another scale related challenge namely sign preservation more precisely the use of volume averaged concentrations might lead locally to an erroneous prediction of the reaction direction i e dissolution instead of crystallization or vice versa the preceding overview aims to clarify that while the governing partial differential equations for reactive transport modeling are largely understood they remain difficult to implement many models and related numerical methods have been developed in order to investigate pore scale physics and mechanics these reactive hydrodynamic models are mainly based on surface reactions or volume reactions surface reactions are well suited to mesh based methods finite volumes molins et al 2012 pereira nunes et al 2016 finite elements akanji and matthai 2010 balhoff et al 2008 lattice boltzmann methods kang et al 2014 ale starchenko et al 2016 boundary element methods barreau et al 1995 liska and colonius 2016 poncet 2007 etc while volume reactions allow most of the usual numerical methods including lbm yoon et al 2012 khirevich and patzek 2018 fv soulaine et al 2017 and sph bandara et al 2013 but require clever modeling of surface localized phenomena volume based modeling using structured meshes can involve crude no slip conditions fusing penalization techniques angot et al 2016 ossmani and poncet 2010 but nowadays two scale models are suitably formalized panga et al 2005 molins et al 2020 soulaine et al 2017 allowing greater physical involvement of the rock matrix in the samples in this work we are proposing a method to tackle some of these issues we suggest coupling a lagrangian formulation of the chemical equations with the superficial velocity formalism introduced in the late 80s by quintard and whitaker 1987a b the velocity formulation relies on a two scale scalar porosity field representing the micro porosity of the rock which can degenerate to 100 to model pure fluid regions macro porosity the appropriate fluid transport equations are recovered in both regions ion transport is governed by a particle method that has been modified in order to accurately handle both diffusion and convection dominated regions care has been taken to ensure that the chemical reaction consistently modifies the micro and macro porosity and thus the specific reactive area lagrangian and particle methods are especially well suited to transport dominant phenomena but most of the time an accurate remeshing step must be periodically performed in order to avoid disorganized particle distributions cottet and koumoutsakos 2000 koumoutsakos 2005 convolving with second order and higher kernels does not preserve the sign however digital rock physics modeling requires ensuring the sign preservation of quantities in chemical terms consequently from a mathematical point of view this is possible only if a relatively inaccurate diffusive remeshing process is used moreover in this study we couple several physical phenomena thereby requiring state variables on both particles and grids hence the need for detailed remeshing and interpolation using smooth and or high order interpolation kernels provides a good contrast on state variables and avoids the concentration of particles on interfaces and fronts the present article describe a technique to overcome these two difficulties how to estimate the diffusion induced by remeshing and thereby adapt the physical diffusion and how and when to switch from a low order to a high order convolution the aim being to minimize the remeshing diffusion when the physical diffusion is too small to be adapted the objective is to introduce a 3d numerical method and apply it in order to perform long time dissolution of real geometries in 3d nevertheless validation is achieved by means of a benchmark problem in 2d and 1d examples are given to illustrate numerical analyze section 2 describes the governing equations of reactive transport one liquid phase through a heterogeneous porous medium including a porous rock matrix and fluid pore space section 3 explains the lagrangian formulation of reactive transport the remeshing procedure and illustrates the weaknesses of several straightforward strategies more particularly over diffusion and instability the a posteriori kernel selection technique is then presented to answer the question and includes a numerical illustration of a variable diffusion heat equation section 4 is dedicated to the numerical implementation of the model based on a hybrid gpu cpu implementation of the method in section 5 we put into practice the full reaction transport diffusion equation with superficial velocity feedback in porous media first for the validation step in section 5 1 we consider the dissolution of a 2d calcite core following the configuration of the benchmark described in molins et al 2020 second in section 5 2 we consider the dissolution process in a high resolution 3d image of a real carbonate rock obtained by microct ferreira et al 2020a this makes it possible to follow the wormhole formation in a heterogeneous media here a non percolating medium whose pore space is composed of fluid inclusions third in order to exhibit a wormholing regime in a more conventional porous medium we consider in the section 5 3 a percolating sandstone featuring a porosity of 28 and a permeability around 10 11 m 2 whose evolution is computed until 70 of its mass is dissolved 2 governing equation of reactive transport 2 1 superficial velocity the superficial velocity u of a viscous fluid in a porous medium can be modeled by the darcy brinkman stokes dbs equation quintard and whitaker 1987b 1 ε 1 ρ u t ε 1 d i v ε 1 ρ u u ε 1 d i v μ d u μ k 1 u f p where porosity is denoted ε and permeability k pressure p density ρ shear rate d u u u t 2 dynamic viscosity μ and external force f the deviated viscosity μ often chosen as being equal to μ can take into account the deviation of thermodynamic or chemical properties due to the strong variations in porosity this equation goes together with the incompressibility condition d i v u 0 when density remains constant but can be non zero due to density variations if fast dissolution or nucleation occurs soulaine et al 2017 in the case of homogeneous materials it can be assumed that permeability depends on porosity this relationship is expressed by the kozeny carman law carman 1937 kozeny 1927 2 k ε k 0 ε 3 1 ε 2 so that the inverse permeability in eq 1 is k ε 1 k 0 1 1 ε 2 ε 3 well defined and vanishing in pure fluid regions i e where porosity equals 1 moreover permeabilities k and k 0 are scalar here and feature isotropic samples and local rock matrix materials but this formalism also applies in the case of a tensorial permeability in this formulation porosity is a scalar field potentially highly variable in space and time in particular this model enables degeneration of porosity to 1 modeling a pure fluid region which locally results in the classical stokes equation in the context of pore scale modeling this formulation take into account both the fluid region inside the pores and the small porosity of the surrounding matrix it is a two scale model furthermore such a term can be used as a penalization technique in order to satisfy a no slip condition at the fluid solid interface angot et al 2016 sanchez et al 2019 by choosing a value of ε that is as small as possible given the robustness of the numerical method used since the problem becomes stiffer as ε decreases in the context of highly viscous darciean flow the first two terms of eq 1 are negligible in combination with the kozeny carman law 2 we therefore obtain 3 d i v μ d u μ k 0 1 1 ε 2 ε 2 u ε f p 2 2 velocity vorticity model and boundary conditions we can convert this expression into a velocity vorticity formulation by taking the curl of eq 3 and introducing vorticity ω u 4 d i v μ d ω μ k 0 1 1 ε 2 ε 2 u ε f p where the right hand side is neglected in the following since the curl of the kozeny carman term generates a ε 3 ε term that is colinear to the right hand side but several orders of magnitude larger in the purely fluid pore space ε is constantly equal to 1 so the term vanishes assuming f 0 this needs to be supplemented with a poisson equation that links velocity to vorticity 5 δ u ω let us consider that the driving force is along direction x so that the sample is bounded in an impermeable non reactive cell in directions y and z this leads to the following boundary conditions reflecting the experiments in the computational cartesian box ω the boundary conditions are periodic in directions y and z the xz and xy faces respectively whereas u x n p n 0 and u y u z 0 in the direction x the yz face these boundary conditions ensure that d i v u 0 on every face along with δ d i v u d i v ω 0 so that d i v u 0 everywhere 0 being the only solution of this equation velocity is lifted by a constant vector u e x that controls the flow rate and make it possible to fit the correct driving force f by proportionality using the linear feature of the dbs equation 2 3 reaction model this velocity vorticity formulation needs to be completed by the transport equation for the fluid species following the quintard and whitaker notation the mass fraction and the molar mass of the kth component are denoted ω f k and mk respectively fluid density which is assumed to be constant is denoted by ρf and the volume fractions of the solid and fluid phases are denoted by ε f and ε s respectively both are related by ε f ε 1 ε s the mass balance by fluid species is then written quintard and whitaker 1987a soulaine et al 2017 6 ε f ρ f ω f k t d i v u ρ f ω f k d i v ε f ρ f σ k ε ω f k m k where σk are the diffusion coefficients of the kth species into the fluid we introduce the superficial concentration 7 c k ε f ρ f ω f k m k and the reaction rate r k c m k m k so that the number of moles of the kth species in a control volume v is ckv and its concentration by unit of fluid is ck ε f all concentrations can be stacked into a vector c r n and the reaction rates into a vector r c depending on the concentrations ck including the stoichiometric coefficients consequently eq 6 can be rewritten as 8 c k t d i v ε 1 u c k d i v σ k ε ε c k r k c and for the solid phase we obtain 9 c k t r k c we assume that diffusion follows archie s law archie 1942 as expressed by wakao and smith 1962 10 σ k ε ε d m where dm is the molecular diffusion of the kth component in practice the lifted operator ε ε ε 1 can be approximated by the gradient operator the boundary conditions for the concentrations are similar to those of the velocity periodic on the lateral faces since the non reactive cell prevents the chemical species from reaching these faces and the input output conditions in the direction x are given by a fluid buffer with an inlet value dirichlet boundary condition and free exit 2 4 global system considered for calcite dissolution in the context of the dissolution of a calcite body occuring in carbonate rocks the idealized chemical reaction considered here is given by 11 caco 3 h ca 2 hco 3 where species concentrations c x t r 3 are denoted by c 1 caco 3 c 2 h and c 3 ca 2 hco 3 indeed a synthetic case is considered in which the initial fluid is ideally free of ca 2 and hco 3 which leads to a permanent equality between these concentrations this spatially distributed reaction is modeled by the evolution of the superficial velocity 3 and concentrations 8 and 9 as follows 12 μ δ u μ k 0 1 1 ε 2 ε 2 u ε f p c 1 t r c c 2 t d i v ε 1 u c 2 d i v σ k ε c 2 r c c 3 t d i v ε 1 u c 3 d i v σ k ε c 3 r c c 1 1 ε v m where v m 36 93 cm mol 1 is the molar volume of calcite the reaction rate associated with an acid kinetic mechanism farshidi et al 2013 steefel and lasaga 1994 is given by the transition state theory tst laidler and king 1983 steefel et al 2015 expressed as follows 13 r c k s a s 1 c 3 2 k e q c 1 c 2 γ 2 c 2 where γ 2 10 3 cm mol 1 is the activity of h a consequence is that porosity follows the equation ε t k s a s v m 1 v m c 3 2 k e q 1 ε c 2 γ 2 c 2 3 particle methods 3 1 lagrangian formulation of 8 eqs 8 and 9 can be solved based on a particle description of c 14 c k t p c k p t δ ξ k p t v k p t where cp ξp vp are concentration position volume triplets called particles that are function only of time t each species has its own particle description since they can be transported at different velocities here we distinguish the fluid species from the solid species according to the velocity the latter remains at rest i e its velocity is equal to zero which is compatible with eq 9 from a theoretical perspective the delta functions δ denote dirac functions defined at different positions including generalized functions suitable for the analysis from a practical perspective this can be understood as being the position of the particle the diffusion transport eq 8 can be computed by means of a lagrangian method using the particle formulation 14 by means of an operator splitting between transport diffusion on the one hand and reaction on the other hand the following system of equations is obtained 15 d c k p d t d i v σ k ε c k c k u ε 1 ξ k p t d ξ k p d t ε 1 ξ k p t u ξ k p t d v k p d t d i v ε 1 u ξ k p t v k p t so long as d i v u 0 so that d i v ε 1 u c k ε 1 u c k c k u ε 1 and such that the chain formula for the transport term ε 1 u c k leads to the dynamical system on the particle positions pushed by the field ε 1 u whose divergence controls the particle volume the only quantity that is of interest for reaction computations is the number of moles by unit of volume vp that is to say c k p vp this quantity satisfies 16 d c k p v k p d t d c k p d t v k p d v k p d t c k p v k p d i v σ k ε c k ξ k p t which is the same as if term u ε 1 is removed from eq 15 consequently the set of eq 15 can be simplified to 17 d c k p d t d i v σ k ε c k ξ k p t d ξ k p d t ε 1 ξ p t u ξ k p t d v k p d t 0 the evaluation of div σk ɛ ck on the particle positions ξp t can be performed either by means of a particle strength exchange method a convolution with a diffusion kernel cf poncet 2006 or using the usual cross shaped scheme in which particles are dispatched on a uniform or structured grid the positions ξ k p t are obtained from a standard dynamical system that can be solved numerically using an explicit runge kutta second or fourth order method and whose solutions follow the field ε 1 u 3 2 remeshing and mesh transfers when the dbs eq 3 and the reaction model 8 and 9 are combined to obtain the global reactive porous media system a strong coupling is obtained between these equations on the one hand the dbs eq 3 gives the superficial velocity field u and depends on porosity ε and on the other hand the reactions give the porosity and depend on velocity the fluid reactions 9 and the solid reactions 9 are coupled the evolution of species concentrations in the fluid can be described either in a eulerian way by 8 or in a lagrangian way by eq 17 in order to construct an efficient solution scheme the dbs equation can be solved using a method finite elements finite volumes finite differences etc other than the one used for the reaction equation for which a lagrangian framework is adopted in this study these different formulations do not need to be simulated at the same resolution however whatever the method chosen to solve the dbs equation the particle position ξ k p t of the fluid species will generally not coincide with the points nodes of the dbs discretization nor with the particle positions of the solid species consequently the solid chemical species c k p t need to be interpolated on the grid used for solving the dbs equation in order to obtain ε and on the fluid particles in order to obtain the diffusion coefficients furthermore the velocity has to be interpolated to the lagrangian set of particles so that u is available for solving eq 17 in addition it is imperative to periodically re position the particles on a structured lattice in order to avoid regions with too much or too little information this is particularly important around stagnation points the interpolation procedure is called remeshing and is crucial to ensure the accuracy and the convergence of particle methods interpolation and remeshing are performed by means of convolution with strongly compact supported kernels let us consider a generalized function f p f p δ x p v p defined in a point wise manner at positions x p r d another set of positions x q and a kernel k i r where i is an interval centered on 0 the interpolation from a set of points to another is then defined by the convolution 18 f q f k h x q r d f y k h x q y d y p f p k h x q x p v p where kh is the rescaled kernel defined by 19 k h x 1 h d k d x h 1 h d k x 1 h k x d h whose characteristic length h is the typical distance between particles in the event of interpolation on a structured grid this length is naturally the step size possibly generalized to anisotropic grids different values of h depending on the direction the integral of kernel k must be equal to 1 in order to ensure a consistent interpolation moreover it must satisfy zero momentum up to the order p 20 k z z k d z 0 for all k 1 p with the p 1 th momentum bounded monaghan 1985 in order to achieve the best possible interpolation remeshing it is necessary to maximize the order and the regularity of k however k is either of order 1 and relatively inaccurate but consistant or is at least order 2 and the second momentum at zero implies that k is negative meaning that the sign of the interpolated quantity is not preserved this point is especially problematic in the case of chemical computations among the symmetric kernels considered in the present work one can mention 21 m 4 x 2 x 3 6 2 1 x 3 3 if 0 x 1 2 x 3 6 if 1 x 2 0 if x 2 which is of order 1 cf chaniotis and poulikakos 2004 but more regular than the hat or tent function λ g x 1 x and 22 m 4 x 3 x 3 5 x 2 2 2 if 0 x 1 2 x 2 1 x 2 if 1 x 2 0 if x 2 which is of second order and of class c 3 except in 0 see monaghan 1985 and chatelin and poncet 2013 cottet et al 2014a a variant of m 4 with a shorter support is 23 m 3 x 3 4 x 2 if 0 x 1 2 3 2 x 2 2 if 1 2 x 3 2 0 if x 3 2 moreover the preservation of the discrete integrals is ensured by the spline like property of all these kernels λ g m 3 m 4 and m 4 24 j z k x j 1 this can easily be demonstrated in 1d but the demonstration being is in any dimension by using the tensorial writing of the kernel 19 indeed if the receiving particles are located on a structured grid that is x q q h and v q h for all q z then the interpolation formula 18 reads 25 q f q v q q p f p k h x q x p v p v q p f p v p q k h q h x p v q p f p v p q k q x p h p f p v p which ensures mass conservation when applied to the species concentrations and momentum conservation when applied to velocity fields 3 3 evidence of over diffusion effects in addition to the issues related to sign preserving another potential issue is over diffusion a first indication is that m 3 0 3 4 1 and m 4 0 2 3 1 more precisely it can be shown that on a structured grid there exists a quadrature of the laplace operator δ h such that the convolution by one of these kernels is expressed as 1 β h 2 δ h o h 3 with β 0 to show how this over diffusion can be corrected and quantified it a one dimensional configuration is described let us consider a uniform grid x p p h p z on which particles are positioned if we consider the usual second order finite difference scheme u x p h 2 u x p 1 2 u x p u x p 1 o h 4 and the radon measure pointwise description d ξ h p z d δ x p it is easy to show that 26 u k x p u x p k 1 h 2 u x p o h 4 the diffusion induced by the remeshing process is therefore 27 d r k 1 h 2 δ t when formalized as an explicit euler scheme whose time step is denoted δt the correction across several dimensions of space is the same the one dimensional correction each 1d correction acting on one second derivative of the laplace operator indeed in two variables of space with step sizes δx and δy the eq 26 is written 28 u k 2 x y r r u x ξ 1 y ξ 2 k ξ 1 d ξ 1 k ξ 2 d ξ 2 r u x y ξ 2 k 1 δ x 2 2 u x 2 x y o δ x 4 k ξ 2 d ξ 2 u x y k 1 δ x 2 2 u x 2 x y k 1 δ y 2 2 u y 2 x y k 1 2 δ y 2 δ x 2 4 u x 2 y 2 x y o δ x 4 o δ y 4 this is easily generalized to multi dimensional remeshing which gives assuming that a common step size h is used 29 u k d u k 1 h 2 δ u o h 4 leading to the same correction coefficient given by eq 27 in case of different step sizes one can either rescale the kernels differently depending on the direction or use this result to apply an anisotropic correction to the diffusion despite the fact that there is no stability condition due to the 1 δt term artificial diffusion can be critical in digital rock physics simulations which typically use values of h that are much larger compared to the characteristic dimensions of pores for example we will use the following example to illustrate our approach designed to tackle this over diffusion problem let us consider the interval ω π π r on which periodic boundary conditions are imposed such that h 2 π n and the nodes are x p π p h with p 0 n 1 let us further assume that the porosity is 1 in the interval 1 2 and 100 elsewhere the diffusion coefficient follows the discontinuous archie s law σ x σ 0 ε x with σ 0 0 5 the numerical parameters are n 100 and δ t 10 2 and the initial condition is given by the one dimensional gaussian function g x 1 2 with 30 g x s 1 s 2 π e x 2 2 s 2 here denoted without subscript since there is only one component in this example consequently defining the initial values of particle c p 0 g x p 1 2 this diffusion equation the solution to 17 with a velocity of zero is solved by means of a second order implicit euler scheme and displayed as a plain black line in fig 1 at different times the initial condition is displayed as a dashed line it can be observed that if the porosity were constant the exact solution would be 31 c x t g x s 2 2 ε t but the fact that the porosity drops from 1 to 10 2 in the interval 1 2 generates a slope discontinuity making this example a non trivial test case solving the same test case using alternate diffusion and remeshing steps with kernel m 4 yields the solution represented by red symbols over diffusion suggested by formula 26 leads to substantial lack of accuracy especially when computing the boundary layer in the low porosity domain 3 4 a posteriori adaptive kernels in the present work we propose to perform an a posteriori kernel selection based on the local peclet number as opposed to an a priori kernel selection it is easy to demonstrate that a priori selective interpolation is not suited to this family of kernels to do so a formula 18 is generalized to a space dependent kernel λ y such as 32 f x r d f y λ h y x y d y where λ h y z h d λ y z h and λ y is m 4 if y 0 and m 4 if y 0 if we consider the constant pointwise function over r equal to a r defined by 33 f k z a δ k h h then its 1d remeshed value at 0 is given by 34 f 0 a λ 1 1 a λ 0 0 λ 1 1 a m 4 1 a m 4 0 a m 4 1 7 6 a which is unstable when performing successive steps of remeshing as a geometric sequence consequently an a posteriori selective kernel is introduced the proposed strategy for choosing the kernel is motivated by the following observation the second order kernel m 4 is not diffusive and can be used when the particle motion is limited namely when the distance traveled in one time step is close to 0 this is typically quantified by the local courant friedrich lewy value α x u x δ t h which implies the definition of the slow region by 35 ω s l o w x ω α x α 0 for a given threshold α 0 it is then possible to select the kernel required to perform an a posteriori interpolation switching from a kernel λ1 in the slow region to a kernel λ2 elsewhere by means of the formula 36 f 1 ω s l o w f λ 1 1 ω f a s t f λ 2 where ω f a s t 1 1 ω s l o w 1 being the characteristic function of the set denoted in the index when considering a low permeability medium or when applying the kozeny carman law 2 the superficial velocity of eq 3 scales as ε 2 k 0 the boundary layer scales as ε k 0 with the right hand side scaling as ε this means that the slow region owing to the archie s law is also the region of the weakest species diffusion when applying the remeshing procedure it is consequently a good strategy to use a non diffusive kernel in the slow region whose lack of sign preservation will not affect particles at quasi rest use a sign preserving kernel in the fast region whose diffusion dr can be predicted and used to correct the diffusion coefficient σk ε in practice we will apply formula 36 with m 4 in the fast region and m 4 in the slow region 37 f 1 ω s l o w f m 4 1 ω f a s t f m 4 in combination with the corrected diffusion coefficient 38 σ k ε σ k ε 1 ω f a s t m 4 1 h 2 δ t the correction term is the d dimensional equivalent of eq 27 for the diffusion induced by remeshing with kernel m 4 it can be observed that this correction is evaluated by means of particles at rest inducing the value m 4 1 this may be improved by considering the local topology of the particle network but at the cost of a great deal of computational time the present solution has no computational cost and is shown see section 5 1 to already dramatically improve the convergence of the method 4 computational aspects and gpu implementation 4 1 numerical method the transport diffusion reaction equations are solved by the lagrangian method 17 described above including the correction 37 38 and the resulting dynamical system is solved by a runge kutta fourth order method at each sub step its velocity field can be obtained by solving the darcy brinkman stokes equation in its formulation 4 after introducing the vorticity ω u and the operator a u v 2 d u v δ u v we can see that d i v 2 μ d u a u μ μ δ ω for a constant viscosity μ a u μ 0 so the solution of the dbs equation is obtained as the limit of the following sequence 39 ω n 1 ω n q μ δ ω n 1 q μ k 0 1 1 ε 2 ε 2 u n 0 where q is a descent parameter whose dimension is a mass per unit of time with the boundary conditions mentioned in section 2 the consistency of this fixed point method is discussed in hume and poncet 2020 in the event of variable viscosity this method can be easily generalized by adding the source term a u n μ the velocity at the next time step is then recovered either by 40 δ u n 1 ω n 1 or by 41 δ ψ n 1 ω n 1 followed by u n 1 ψ n 1 including the lift velocity at the boundary conditions providing the driving force these sequences 39 and 40 or 39 41 are always evaluated after a remeshing step so that all the differential operators are computed by straightforward finite difference schemes fourth order since the remeshed particle network is structured these last three equations are implicit and involve non separable poisson equation solved fusing the mudpack solver based on fast fourier transforms fft and tchebitchev polynomials adams 1993 these algorithms complexity scale as o n log n where n is the number of particles coinciding with the number of underlying grid points of the remeshed particle network for more details see hejlesen et al 2015 cottet et al 2014b molins et al 2020 ossmani and poncet 2010 for the velocity vorticity formulation and sanchez et al 2019 chatelin and poncet 2013 for the velocity pressure formulation remeshing and finite difference schemes are processed direction by direction magni and cottet 2012 which corresponds to a second level of fractional steps algorithms in the present simulations we use the sequence 39 41 whose numerical solution algebraically satisfies d i v u n 1 d i v ψ n 1 0 since the discrete operators of finite difference schemes satisfy div 0 exactly note that to satisfy this property for the sequence 39 and 40 staggered grids are required but by using colocation the state variable is aligned with the microct scan data once the velocity has been updated the chemical system 17 in its lagrangian form is pushed to the next time step by means of a runge kutta second or fourth order scheme diffusion is computed by a finite difference scheme as mentioned above an important consequence of the lagrangian formulation is that it removes the transport terms in eq 17 hence removing as well its stability condition leading to aparticularly robust method lastly the resulting particles carrying the chemical state variable are remeshed on the underlying uniform grid which has no impact on the divergence free velocity field and the next time step can begin fig 2 shows the directed acyclic graph for these temporal iterations 4 2 hybrid cpu gpu implementation the numerical applications presented below where performed using an in house code which is due to be being open source and is currently in its first release candidate version the software is a generic high performance hybrid computing code for remeshed particle methods the entire code is based on an operator splitting strategy where each operator is solved with the most appropriate numerical method currently all the methods considered are cartesian grid based methods such as finite difference spectral and remeshed particle methods the actual development started with the introduction of high order remeshing formulas well suited to gpu implementation using opencl etancelin 2014 cottet et al 2014a more recently the code has been successfully used for passive control of bluff body flows mimeau et al 2017 and for sediment flow simulations keck 2019 in the next paragraphs we briefly describe the key features of the library the overall structure of the library is written in python so as to benefit from object oriented programming and high level interfaces with utilities such as data representation on cartesian grids mpi opencl compiled languages interoperability symbolic computations and hdf5 parallel i o through the python packages numpy mpi4py pyopencl f2py sympy and h5py using the code consists in defining the different operators that act on several variables defined on a computational domain the operators are obtained by equations splitting the variables are either present in the equations or intermediate variables this high level of abstraction is designed to solve problems regardless of the architecture and discrete models used in practice the problem description must be formalized as a directed acyclic graph of operators that defines a temporal iteration of the semi discrete equations where vertices represent the operators and edges represent the dependencies between operators operators are defined along with their numerical discretization numerical method parameters and targeted architecture the graph is automatically completed in order to insert appropriate low level operators and ensure data consistency of variables across the different discretization characteristics and architecture once the graph is defined the gpu targeted operators are being initialized by means of automatic code generation and performance auto tuning gpu kernels code is generated either using simple text formatting capabilities or abstract syntax trees from a symbolic representation of variables the former is used in case of complex algorithms generated by numerical methods while the latter is mostly used for vectorization of simple expressions the autotuning of the gpu kernels ensures optimal use of resources thanks to the adjustment of kernel parameters with discretization and hardware capabilities finally data locality is managed automatically in the case accelerated and distributed architectures gpu operators work on device mirrored data and memory coherence is maintained by the library itself thanks to the pyopencl package distributed architectures are handled by a fixed domain decomposition through mpi cartesian topologies all communication patterns can therefore be set up and optimized during the initialization phase 5 application to rock dissolution 5 1 validation of the fully coupled model to validate the proposed model the chemical reaction and the global model described in section 2 4 are considered based on the 2d benchmark described in molins et al 2020 it consists of a circular 1 porous calcite core of radius 0 01cm in a channel 0 05 cm wide and 0 1 cm long as shown in fig 3 exposed to hydrochloric acid injection at p h 2 and flow rate 0 12 cm s 1 periodic boundary conditions are set at the top and bottom walls which by symmetry are equivalent to free slip and no slip through boundary conditions for both the hydrodynamics and the species transport including acid and products in fig 4 a and b we compare the spatial distribution of the acid concentration at two points in time for diffusive top half and diffusion corrected simulations bottom half the most obvious difference is that the concentration gradient is spread out over a larger distance in the diffusive case a closer look shows that the contour of the crystal is also slightly different i e more elongated relative to the direction of flow in the corrected case grain size evolution defined as the volume inside the 0 5 level of porosity is represented in fig 4c it is clear that the simulations based on adaptive a posteriori kernel selection and a corrected diffusion coefficient yield similar results on all considered the meshes considered predicting the time of complete dissolution at around t 4200 in accordance with results from molins et al 2020 even on the finest discretization considered the simulations using diffusive remeshing overestimate the time needed for complete dissolution moreover comparison of the contour at t 45 min with the contours from molins et al 2020 in fig 4d shows that the grain shape isovalue at ε 0 5 is quite similar whether we use the corrected method in blue or not in light green the practical advantages of correction are consequently to avoid the appearance of fuzzy solid see fig 4c for instance to increase reliability since convergence is much improved when using the correction the curves at 128 256 and 256 512 are superimposed in fig 4c it is also worth noting that the present method does not need to be constrained by the reaction to be located at the interface as it is commonly performed in dissolution simulations 5 2 dissolution of a non percolating 3d carbonate rock the second case focuses on the impact of dissolution on the hydraulic properties of carbonates the rock studied is indiana limestone an almost pure outcrop rock composed of 99 calcite the initial geometry of the rock is provided by ferreira et al through the digital rocks portal ferreira et al 2020a 2020b based on the methodology outlined in arns et al 2019 the concept of backgroud porosity ferreira et al argue that none of the voxels are pore free at the resolution used they conclude in a 5 porosity for the solid matrix which is fully compatible with the present formalism by setting ε 0 05 in the solid region this type of sample is especially challenging as it comprises both pores and a porous but non percolating rock matrix by non percolating we mean that the pure fluid region ε 1 is not continuous between the inlet and outlet faces in this work the gray level g of each voxel is converted into a porosity field ε as follows 42 ε 1 if 1 g g p t 1 0 05 g t s g g t s g p t α 0 05 if g p t g g t s 0 05 if g t s g 2 16 where the grey level thresholds between the pores and the transition zone g p t 9000 and between the transition zone and the solid phase g t s 12 000 are visually determined based on an image analysis and where the exponent α 2 25 is calibrated such that the overall porosity of the rock corresponds to the measured porosity of 14 9 ferreira et al 2020a 2020b the initial geometry is characterized by an absolute permeability of k 10 14 m2 the specific reactive area is computed from an estimation of the pore solid interface so that a s 1582 m 1 the other simulation parameters are summarized in table 1 in this example the following pclet and damkhler numbers are considered 43 p u k d m 2 and d a i i r d m a s 6 3 10 6 and are expected to lead to wormhole formation soulaine et al 2017 the goal of the present study is to measure permeability evolution throughout the dissolution process so several macroscopic indicators were computed as shown in fig 7 we first computed a porosity estimate ϕ of our sample based on the pores volume as ϕ ω ε d v the estimation of the permeability k is derived directly from the darcy s law as 44 k μ u x f where is a volume averaged quantity and ux is the velocity in the flow direction the term f f p since p 0 is not computed in the method because of the velocity vorticity formulation of the dbs eq 4 consequently we reconstructed this quantity through eq 8 from the computed values of ux with second order finite differences one can see that if the fluid region ω fluid is defined where ε 1 and ε 0 elsewhere hence considering a fluid solid partition then ϕ tends towards the volume of ω fluid and u tends towards 0 in the solid region so that the usual definition of permeability is obtained lim ε 0 k μ ϕ f ω f l u i d u x d v finally the following averaged quantities c 2 and c 3 where also computed indicating the overall behavior of the chemical species from the raw dataset we extracted a sample of 5123 voxels placed in a non reactive and non permeable solid casing this region denoted ω is defined as a quartic cylinder of radius 11 mm in direction x as shown in fig 5 the choice of using a casing was made to improve the regularity of the geometry of domains to maximize the useful volume of data the sample was taken at the same resolution as the raw data i e voxels of size 0 045263 mm3 based on the sample data an estimated porosity value of 15 6 was obtained which is close to the global rock porosity after the first iteration of the method the initial flow field was characterized and an averaged velocity in direction x of u x 2 045 10 5 m s 1 was measured which corresponds to a mass flow rate of 10 981 ml s 1 an initial permeability of k 2 62 10 14 m2 was obtained based on an estimation of the driving force of f 7 80 10 5 nm 3 which is in a good accordance with the overall absolute permeability this value may be sensitive to the choice of gray scale conversion 42 from microct images in order to simulate the effect of fluid inclusions what gray et al 2018 refer to as detailed structure versus the homogeneous equivalent material we focused on a sub sample of 1283 voxels that is characterized by the presence of a large pore in a crescent shape as illustrated in fig 6 in this sub sample we enforced boundary conditions inherited from the superficial velocity of the full sample and began the simulation at t 0 with the acid inlet at p h 2 as for the full sample as expected for the pclet damkhler regimes the acid flows created a dominant wormhole through the calcite connecting high porosity regions as shown in fig 8a the dissolution process leads to an increase in porosity over time a dramatic change occurs once the first wormhole reaches the opposite end of the sample material the acid flow fills the opened pores and digs through the calcite in the regions with the lowest local porosity as a result the overall acidity rises over time as shown in fig 8b the sample considered contains a large open regular shaped pore that explains the nearly constant evolution of products concentration during digging times once the dominant wormhole becomes a through hole jumps in both permeability and concentration can be observed when the wormhole is complete the acid is expected to no longer be fully consumed according to ferreira et al 2020b 5 3 dissolution of a percolating 3d carbonate rock the third case focuses on the dissolution of a castlegate sandstone sample sheppard and prodanovic 2015 at a resolution of 2563 voxels displayed on the right picture of fig 8 this dataset is used only as an input geometry and we assume the same 5 porosity for the solid matrix as in section 5 2 so that here the initial porosity is larger than the estimation from sheppard and prodanovic 2015 the voxel size is 5 63 µm3 giving a sample of 1 43 mm wide in this case the black and white image is simply converted to bang bang values for ε an inlet velocity of u 2 10 5 m s 1 was enforced corresponding to a mass flow rate of 0 164 µl s 1 the specific reactive area is estimated from the pore solid interface so that a s 8288 m 1 and the molecular diffusion is set at d m 10 10 m2 s 1 together with a dissolution constant k s 10 2 the absolute permeability of the sample is unknown but an estimated initial permeability of k 1 22 10 11 m 2 was obtained with a driving force of f 603 nm 3 and the initial porosity is computed at ϕ 0 284 this case is characterized by p e 0 7 and d a i i 1 2 10 4 that is to say d a i 1 7 10 4 the evolution of permeability and porosity are shown on fig 8 we can observe more regularity than for the non percolating geometry studied in the previous section since there is no break through process 50 h of dissolution are simulated making the porosity grow from 28 to 70 associated to an increase of permeability furthermore one can observe a dramatic growth of permeability once the porosity reaches 50 around 20 h at such a high dahmkhler number the dissolution regime is expected to be driven by the peclet number according to soulaine et al 2017 their figure 15 on page 476 we expect conical wormholes in the present simulation the typical feature of 0 01 pe 1 and dai 1 with a pclet number close to the dominant wormhole regime to the opposite of the synthetic configurations considered in soulaine et al 2017 the present real geometry exhibits a natural ramified structure consequently leading to an apparently ramified wormholing as shown on fig 10 up to 12 h nevertheless long time scales more than 40 h in our simulation lead to a set of a few conical wormholes the evolution of the rock matrix is specifically displayed on the bottom pictures of fig 10 in order to identify more clearly the regime occurring the time derivation of the local porosity ε t is displayed on the fig 9 at time t 12 3 h showing that the dissolution is occurring at the fluid solid interface and not dispatch over all the pores featuring a collection of individual conical wormholes finally if the pclet number was based on a typical size of pore throats counting roughly 5 pores in the sample width its resulting value would be 82 time larger and the coherence with the pclet number based on the permeability may deserve to be investigated 6 conclusions and perspectives this study focused on the accurate simulation of dissolution processes at pore scale this paper presents a transport diffusion dissolution model that consistently couples a lagrangian formulation for the reaction equations with the superficial velocity formalism introduced by quintard and whitaker the present study shows that a posteriori kernel selection makes if possible to reconcile accurate interpolation and sign preservation the main outcome is that the method benefits from the quality of particle tracking for the transport the quality of the particle distribution through the remeshing procedure and the accurate computation of the diffusion owing to its adaptation to the choice of remeshing kernel this adaptative diffusion was performed in two steps first by selecting a remeshing kernel as a function of the local porosity in order to maximize the interpolation order in fast regions and minimize the spurious diffusion in the rock matrix physically small due to archie s law second by adjusting the diffusion coefficient using an a posteriori estimation of the spurious diffusion induced by the remeshing procedure the robust method developed in this article could be extended naturally to the computation of reactions between fluids with an heterogeneous rheology or plasticity and to precipitation and crystallization processes future studies will focus on the different dissolution regimes in rocks exhibiting ramified pore structures in order to build

389,this article shows how to consistently and accurately manage the lagrangian formulation of chemical reaction equations coupled with the superficial velocity formalism introduced in the late 80s by quintard and whitaker lagrangian methods prove very helpful in problems in which transport effects are strong or dominant but they need to be periodically put back in a regular lattice a process called remeshing in the context of digital rock physics we need to ensure positive concentrations and regularity to accurately handle stagnation point neighborhoods these two conditions lead to the use of kernels resulting in extra diffusion which can be prohibitively high when the diffusion coefficient is small this is the case especially for reactive porous media and the phenomenon is reinforced in porous rock matrices due to archie s law this article shows how to overcome this difficulty in the context of a two scale porosity model applied in the darcy brinkman stokes equations and how to obtain simultaneous sign preservation regularity and accurate diffusion and apply it to dissolution processes at the pore scale of actual rocks keywords three dimensional flows digital rock physics reactive flows dissolution process lagrangian methods porous media 1 introduction dissolution processes at pore scale play a crucial role in a wide range of applications for example mineral dissolution alters the hydraulic conductivity of soils wissmeier and barry 2009 and calcite dissolution in seawater is a key mechanism affecting the global carbon budget of the planet naviaux et al 2019 several emerging technologies rely on an in depth understanding of dissolution mechanisms such as the storage of natural gas in underground caverns located in deep salt domes bayram and bektasoglu 2020 the assessment of the long term storage capacity of co2 in carbonate formations hao et al 2019 singh et al 2018 and the chemical stimulation of geothermal reservoirs lucas et al 2020 other industrial processes such as water desalination also rely on the dissolution of caco3 lehmann et al 2013 the modeling of reactive transport and dissolution at pore scale is currently still a challenge in the context of co2 sequestration liu et al 2019 highlighted the need to develop numerical schemes meeting requirements of stability and convergence as well as local mass conservation and minimal numerical diffusion steefel et al 2005 advocated for the use of reactive transport models in earth sciences yet stressed that capturing the scale dependence of reactive transport processes is a challenge yet to be overcome as a concrete example of this scale dependence we can cite the work of gray et al 2018 confronting experimental results with simulations of calcite dissolution in hcl showed that small morphological features such as pore throat size micro porosity and specific reactive area could have a significant impact on the reaction rates and the dissolution patterns obtained li et al 2006 focused their attention on another scale related challenge namely sign preservation more precisely the use of volume averaged concentrations might lead locally to an erroneous prediction of the reaction direction i e dissolution instead of crystallization or vice versa the preceding overview aims to clarify that while the governing partial differential equations for reactive transport modeling are largely understood they remain difficult to implement many models and related numerical methods have been developed in order to investigate pore scale physics and mechanics these reactive hydrodynamic models are mainly based on surface reactions or volume reactions surface reactions are well suited to mesh based methods finite volumes molins et al 2012 pereira nunes et al 2016 finite elements akanji and matthai 2010 balhoff et al 2008 lattice boltzmann methods kang et al 2014 ale starchenko et al 2016 boundary element methods barreau et al 1995 liska and colonius 2016 poncet 2007 etc while volume reactions allow most of the usual numerical methods including lbm yoon et al 2012 khirevich and patzek 2018 fv soulaine et al 2017 and sph bandara et al 2013 but require clever modeling of surface localized phenomena volume based modeling using structured meshes can involve crude no slip conditions fusing penalization techniques angot et al 2016 ossmani and poncet 2010 but nowadays two scale models are suitably formalized panga et al 2005 molins et al 2020 soulaine et al 2017 allowing greater physical involvement of the rock matrix in the samples in this work we are proposing a method to tackle some of these issues we suggest coupling a lagrangian formulation of the chemical equations with the superficial velocity formalism introduced in the late 80s by quintard and whitaker 1987a b the velocity formulation relies on a two scale scalar porosity field representing the micro porosity of the rock which can degenerate to 100 to model pure fluid regions macro porosity the appropriate fluid transport equations are recovered in both regions ion transport is governed by a particle method that has been modified in order to accurately handle both diffusion and convection dominated regions care has been taken to ensure that the chemical reaction consistently modifies the micro and macro porosity and thus the specific reactive area lagrangian and particle methods are especially well suited to transport dominant phenomena but most of the time an accurate remeshing step must be periodically performed in order to avoid disorganized particle distributions cottet and koumoutsakos 2000 koumoutsakos 2005 convolving with second order and higher kernels does not preserve the sign however digital rock physics modeling requires ensuring the sign preservation of quantities in chemical terms consequently from a mathematical point of view this is possible only if a relatively inaccurate diffusive remeshing process is used moreover in this study we couple several physical phenomena thereby requiring state variables on both particles and grids hence the need for detailed remeshing and interpolation using smooth and or high order interpolation kernels provides a good contrast on state variables and avoids the concentration of particles on interfaces and fronts the present article describe a technique to overcome these two difficulties how to estimate the diffusion induced by remeshing and thereby adapt the physical diffusion and how and when to switch from a low order to a high order convolution the aim being to minimize the remeshing diffusion when the physical diffusion is too small to be adapted the objective is to introduce a 3d numerical method and apply it in order to perform long time dissolution of real geometries in 3d nevertheless validation is achieved by means of a benchmark problem in 2d and 1d examples are given to illustrate numerical analyze section 2 describes the governing equations of reactive transport one liquid phase through a heterogeneous porous medium including a porous rock matrix and fluid pore space section 3 explains the lagrangian formulation of reactive transport the remeshing procedure and illustrates the weaknesses of several straightforward strategies more particularly over diffusion and instability the a posteriori kernel selection technique is then presented to answer the question and includes a numerical illustration of a variable diffusion heat equation section 4 is dedicated to the numerical implementation of the model based on a hybrid gpu cpu implementation of the method in section 5 we put into practice the full reaction transport diffusion equation with superficial velocity feedback in porous media first for the validation step in section 5 1 we consider the dissolution of a 2d calcite core following the configuration of the benchmark described in molins et al 2020 second in section 5 2 we consider the dissolution process in a high resolution 3d image of a real carbonate rock obtained by microct ferreira et al 2020a this makes it possible to follow the wormhole formation in a heterogeneous media here a non percolating medium whose pore space is composed of fluid inclusions third in order to exhibit a wormholing regime in a more conventional porous medium we consider in the section 5 3 a percolating sandstone featuring a porosity of 28 and a permeability around 10 11 m 2 whose evolution is computed until 70 of its mass is dissolved 2 governing equation of reactive transport 2 1 superficial velocity the superficial velocity u of a viscous fluid in a porous medium can be modeled by the darcy brinkman stokes dbs equation quintard and whitaker 1987b 1 ε 1 ρ u t ε 1 d i v ε 1 ρ u u ε 1 d i v μ d u μ k 1 u f p where porosity is denoted ε and permeability k pressure p density ρ shear rate d u u u t 2 dynamic viscosity μ and external force f the deviated viscosity μ often chosen as being equal to μ can take into account the deviation of thermodynamic or chemical properties due to the strong variations in porosity this equation goes together with the incompressibility condition d i v u 0 when density remains constant but can be non zero due to density variations if fast dissolution or nucleation occurs soulaine et al 2017 in the case of homogeneous materials it can be assumed that permeability depends on porosity this relationship is expressed by the kozeny carman law carman 1937 kozeny 1927 2 k ε k 0 ε 3 1 ε 2 so that the inverse permeability in eq 1 is k ε 1 k 0 1 1 ε 2 ε 3 well defined and vanishing in pure fluid regions i e where porosity equals 1 moreover permeabilities k and k 0 are scalar here and feature isotropic samples and local rock matrix materials but this formalism also applies in the case of a tensorial permeability in this formulation porosity is a scalar field potentially highly variable in space and time in particular this model enables degeneration of porosity to 1 modeling a pure fluid region which locally results in the classical stokes equation in the context of pore scale modeling this formulation take into account both the fluid region inside the pores and the small porosity of the surrounding matrix it is a two scale model furthermore such a term can be used as a penalization technique in order to satisfy a no slip condition at the fluid solid interface angot et al 2016 sanchez et al 2019 by choosing a value of ε that is as small as possible given the robustness of the numerical method used since the problem becomes stiffer as ε decreases in the context of highly viscous darciean flow the first two terms of eq 1 are negligible in combination with the kozeny carman law 2 we therefore obtain 3 d i v μ d u μ k 0 1 1 ε 2 ε 2 u ε f p 2 2 velocity vorticity model and boundary conditions we can convert this expression into a velocity vorticity formulation by taking the curl of eq 3 and introducing vorticity ω u 4 d i v μ d ω μ k 0 1 1 ε 2 ε 2 u ε f p where the right hand side is neglected in the following since the curl of the kozeny carman term generates a ε 3 ε term that is colinear to the right hand side but several orders of magnitude larger in the purely fluid pore space ε is constantly equal to 1 so the term vanishes assuming f 0 this needs to be supplemented with a poisson equation that links velocity to vorticity 5 δ u ω let us consider that the driving force is along direction x so that the sample is bounded in an impermeable non reactive cell in directions y and z this leads to the following boundary conditions reflecting the experiments in the computational cartesian box ω the boundary conditions are periodic in directions y and z the xz and xy faces respectively whereas u x n p n 0 and u y u z 0 in the direction x the yz face these boundary conditions ensure that d i v u 0 on every face along with δ d i v u d i v ω 0 so that d i v u 0 everywhere 0 being the only solution of this equation velocity is lifted by a constant vector u e x that controls the flow rate and make it possible to fit the correct driving force f by proportionality using the linear feature of the dbs equation 2 3 reaction model this velocity vorticity formulation needs to be completed by the transport equation for the fluid species following the quintard and whitaker notation the mass fraction and the molar mass of the kth component are denoted ω f k and mk respectively fluid density which is assumed to be constant is denoted by ρf and the volume fractions of the solid and fluid phases are denoted by ε f and ε s respectively both are related by ε f ε 1 ε s the mass balance by fluid species is then written quintard and whitaker 1987a soulaine et al 2017 6 ε f ρ f ω f k t d i v u ρ f ω f k d i v ε f ρ f σ k ε ω f k m k where σk are the diffusion coefficients of the kth species into the fluid we introduce the superficial concentration 7 c k ε f ρ f ω f k m k and the reaction rate r k c m k m k so that the number of moles of the kth species in a control volume v is ckv and its concentration by unit of fluid is ck ε f all concentrations can be stacked into a vector c r n and the reaction rates into a vector r c depending on the concentrations ck including the stoichiometric coefficients consequently eq 6 can be rewritten as 8 c k t d i v ε 1 u c k d i v σ k ε ε c k r k c and for the solid phase we obtain 9 c k t r k c we assume that diffusion follows archie s law archie 1942 as expressed by wakao and smith 1962 10 σ k ε ε d m where dm is the molecular diffusion of the kth component in practice the lifted operator ε ε ε 1 can be approximated by the gradient operator the boundary conditions for the concentrations are similar to those of the velocity periodic on the lateral faces since the non reactive cell prevents the chemical species from reaching these faces and the input output conditions in the direction x are given by a fluid buffer with an inlet value dirichlet boundary condition and free exit 2 4 global system considered for calcite dissolution in the context of the dissolution of a calcite body occuring in carbonate rocks the idealized chemical reaction considered here is given by 11 caco 3 h ca 2 hco 3 where species concentrations c x t r 3 are denoted by c 1 caco 3 c 2 h and c 3 ca 2 hco 3 indeed a synthetic case is considered in which the initial fluid is ideally free of ca 2 and hco 3 which leads to a permanent equality between these concentrations this spatially distributed reaction is modeled by the evolution of the superficial velocity 3 and concentrations 8 and 9 as follows 12 μ δ u μ k 0 1 1 ε 2 ε 2 u ε f p c 1 t r c c 2 t d i v ε 1 u c 2 d i v σ k ε c 2 r c c 3 t d i v ε 1 u c 3 d i v σ k ε c 3 r c c 1 1 ε v m where v m 36 93 cm mol 1 is the molar volume of calcite the reaction rate associated with an acid kinetic mechanism farshidi et al 2013 steefel and lasaga 1994 is given by the transition state theory tst laidler and king 1983 steefel et al 2015 expressed as follows 13 r c k s a s 1 c 3 2 k e q c 1 c 2 γ 2 c 2 where γ 2 10 3 cm mol 1 is the activity of h a consequence is that porosity follows the equation ε t k s a s v m 1 v m c 3 2 k e q 1 ε c 2 γ 2 c 2 3 particle methods 3 1 lagrangian formulation of 8 eqs 8 and 9 can be solved based on a particle description of c 14 c k t p c k p t δ ξ k p t v k p t where cp ξp vp are concentration position volume triplets called particles that are function only of time t each species has its own particle description since they can be transported at different velocities here we distinguish the fluid species from the solid species according to the velocity the latter remains at rest i e its velocity is equal to zero which is compatible with eq 9 from a theoretical perspective the delta functions δ denote dirac functions defined at different positions including generalized functions suitable for the analysis from a practical perspective this can be understood as being the position of the particle the diffusion transport eq 8 can be computed by means of a lagrangian method using the particle formulation 14 by means of an operator splitting between transport diffusion on the one hand and reaction on the other hand the following system of equations is obtained 15 d c k p d t d i v σ k ε c k c k u ε 1 ξ k p t d ξ k p d t ε 1 ξ k p t u ξ k p t d v k p d t d i v ε 1 u ξ k p t v k p t so long as d i v u 0 so that d i v ε 1 u c k ε 1 u c k c k u ε 1 and such that the chain formula for the transport term ε 1 u c k leads to the dynamical system on the particle positions pushed by the field ε 1 u whose divergence controls the particle volume the only quantity that is of interest for reaction computations is the number of moles by unit of volume vp that is to say c k p vp this quantity satisfies 16 d c k p v k p d t d c k p d t v k p d v k p d t c k p v k p d i v σ k ε c k ξ k p t which is the same as if term u ε 1 is removed from eq 15 consequently the set of eq 15 can be simplified to 17 d c k p d t d i v σ k ε c k ξ k p t d ξ k p d t ε 1 ξ p t u ξ k p t d v k p d t 0 the evaluation of div σk ɛ ck on the particle positions ξp t can be performed either by means of a particle strength exchange method a convolution with a diffusion kernel cf poncet 2006 or using the usual cross shaped scheme in which particles are dispatched on a uniform or structured grid the positions ξ k p t are obtained from a standard dynamical system that can be solved numerically using an explicit runge kutta second or fourth order method and whose solutions follow the field ε 1 u 3 2 remeshing and mesh transfers when the dbs eq 3 and the reaction model 8 and 9 are combined to obtain the global reactive porous media system a strong coupling is obtained between these equations on the one hand the dbs eq 3 gives the superficial velocity field u and depends on porosity ε and on the other hand the reactions give the porosity and depend on velocity the fluid reactions 9 and the solid reactions 9 are coupled the evolution of species concentrations in the fluid can be described either in a eulerian way by 8 or in a lagrangian way by eq 17 in order to construct an efficient solution scheme the dbs equation can be solved using a method finite elements finite volumes finite differences etc other than the one used for the reaction equation for which a lagrangian framework is adopted in this study these different formulations do not need to be simulated at the same resolution however whatever the method chosen to solve the dbs equation the particle position ξ k p t of the fluid species will generally not coincide with the points nodes of the dbs discretization nor with the particle positions of the solid species consequently the solid chemical species c k p t need to be interpolated on the grid used for solving the dbs equation in order to obtain ε and on the fluid particles in order to obtain the diffusion coefficients furthermore the velocity has to be interpolated to the lagrangian set of particles so that u is available for solving eq 17 in addition it is imperative to periodically re position the particles on a structured lattice in order to avoid regions with too much or too little information this is particularly important around stagnation points the interpolation procedure is called remeshing and is crucial to ensure the accuracy and the convergence of particle methods interpolation and remeshing are performed by means of convolution with strongly compact supported kernels let us consider a generalized function f p f p δ x p v p defined in a point wise manner at positions x p r d another set of positions x q and a kernel k i r where i is an interval centered on 0 the interpolation from a set of points to another is then defined by the convolution 18 f q f k h x q r d f y k h x q y d y p f p k h x q x p v p where kh is the rescaled kernel defined by 19 k h x 1 h d k d x h 1 h d k x 1 h k x d h whose characteristic length h is the typical distance between particles in the event of interpolation on a structured grid this length is naturally the step size possibly generalized to anisotropic grids different values of h depending on the direction the integral of kernel k must be equal to 1 in order to ensure a consistent interpolation moreover it must satisfy zero momentum up to the order p 20 k z z k d z 0 for all k 1 p with the p 1 th momentum bounded monaghan 1985 in order to achieve the best possible interpolation remeshing it is necessary to maximize the order and the regularity of k however k is either of order 1 and relatively inaccurate but consistant or is at least order 2 and the second momentum at zero implies that k is negative meaning that the sign of the interpolated quantity is not preserved this point is especially problematic in the case of chemical computations among the symmetric kernels considered in the present work one can mention 21 m 4 x 2 x 3 6 2 1 x 3 3 if 0 x 1 2 x 3 6 if 1 x 2 0 if x 2 which is of order 1 cf chaniotis and poulikakos 2004 but more regular than the hat or tent function λ g x 1 x and 22 m 4 x 3 x 3 5 x 2 2 2 if 0 x 1 2 x 2 1 x 2 if 1 x 2 0 if x 2 which is of second order and of class c 3 except in 0 see monaghan 1985 and chatelin and poncet 2013 cottet et al 2014a a variant of m 4 with a shorter support is 23 m 3 x 3 4 x 2 if 0 x 1 2 3 2 x 2 2 if 1 2 x 3 2 0 if x 3 2 moreover the preservation of the discrete integrals is ensured by the spline like property of all these kernels λ g m 3 m 4 and m 4 24 j z k x j 1 this can easily be demonstrated in 1d but the demonstration being is in any dimension by using the tensorial writing of the kernel 19 indeed if the receiving particles are located on a structured grid that is x q q h and v q h for all q z then the interpolation formula 18 reads 25 q f q v q q p f p k h x q x p v p v q p f p v p q k h q h x p v q p f p v p q k q x p h p f p v p which ensures mass conservation when applied to the species concentrations and momentum conservation when applied to velocity fields 3 3 evidence of over diffusion effects in addition to the issues related to sign preserving another potential issue is over diffusion a first indication is that m 3 0 3 4 1 and m 4 0 2 3 1 more precisely it can be shown that on a structured grid there exists a quadrature of the laplace operator δ h such that the convolution by one of these kernels is expressed as 1 β h 2 δ h o h 3 with β 0 to show how this over diffusion can be corrected and quantified it a one dimensional configuration is described let us consider a uniform grid x p p h p z on which particles are positioned if we consider the usual second order finite difference scheme u x p h 2 u x p 1 2 u x p u x p 1 o h 4 and the radon measure pointwise description d ξ h p z d δ x p it is easy to show that 26 u k x p u x p k 1 h 2 u x p o h 4 the diffusion induced by the remeshing process is therefore 27 d r k 1 h 2 δ t when formalized as an explicit euler scheme whose time step is denoted δt the correction across several dimensions of space is the same the one dimensional correction each 1d correction acting on one second derivative of the laplace operator indeed in two variables of space with step sizes δx and δy the eq 26 is written 28 u k 2 x y r r u x ξ 1 y ξ 2 k ξ 1 d ξ 1 k ξ 2 d ξ 2 r u x y ξ 2 k 1 δ x 2 2 u x 2 x y o δ x 4 k ξ 2 d ξ 2 u x y k 1 δ x 2 2 u x 2 x y k 1 δ y 2 2 u y 2 x y k 1 2 δ y 2 δ x 2 4 u x 2 y 2 x y o δ x 4 o δ y 4 this is easily generalized to multi dimensional remeshing which gives assuming that a common step size h is used 29 u k d u k 1 h 2 δ u o h 4 leading to the same correction coefficient given by eq 27 in case of different step sizes one can either rescale the kernels differently depending on the direction or use this result to apply an anisotropic correction to the diffusion despite the fact that there is no stability condition due to the 1 δt term artificial diffusion can be critical in digital rock physics simulations which typically use values of h that are much larger compared to the characteristic dimensions of pores for example we will use the following example to illustrate our approach designed to tackle this over diffusion problem let us consider the interval ω π π r on which periodic boundary conditions are imposed such that h 2 π n and the nodes are x p π p h with p 0 n 1 let us further assume that the porosity is 1 in the interval 1 2 and 100 elsewhere the diffusion coefficient follows the discontinuous archie s law σ x σ 0 ε x with σ 0 0 5 the numerical parameters are n 100 and δ t 10 2 and the initial condition is given by the one dimensional gaussian function g x 1 2 with 30 g x s 1 s 2 π e x 2 2 s 2 here denoted without subscript since there is only one component in this example consequently defining the initial values of particle c p 0 g x p 1 2 this diffusion equation the solution to 17 with a velocity of zero is solved by means of a second order implicit euler scheme and displayed as a plain black line in fig 1 at different times the initial condition is displayed as a dashed line it can be observed that if the porosity were constant the exact solution would be 31 c x t g x s 2 2 ε t but the fact that the porosity drops from 1 to 10 2 in the interval 1 2 generates a slope discontinuity making this example a non trivial test case solving the same test case using alternate diffusion and remeshing steps with kernel m 4 yields the solution represented by red symbols over diffusion suggested by formula 26 leads to substantial lack of accuracy especially when computing the boundary layer in the low porosity domain 3 4 a posteriori adaptive kernels in the present work we propose to perform an a posteriori kernel selection based on the local peclet number as opposed to an a priori kernel selection it is easy to demonstrate that a priori selective interpolation is not suited to this family of kernels to do so a formula 18 is generalized to a space dependent kernel λ y such as 32 f x r d f y λ h y x y d y where λ h y z h d λ y z h and λ y is m 4 if y 0 and m 4 if y 0 if we consider the constant pointwise function over r equal to a r defined by 33 f k z a δ k h h then its 1d remeshed value at 0 is given by 34 f 0 a λ 1 1 a λ 0 0 λ 1 1 a m 4 1 a m 4 0 a m 4 1 7 6 a which is unstable when performing successive steps of remeshing as a geometric sequence consequently an a posteriori selective kernel is introduced the proposed strategy for choosing the kernel is motivated by the following observation the second order kernel m 4 is not diffusive and can be used when the particle motion is limited namely when the distance traveled in one time step is close to 0 this is typically quantified by the local courant friedrich lewy value α x u x δ t h which implies the definition of the slow region by 35 ω s l o w x ω α x α 0 for a given threshold α 0 it is then possible to select the kernel required to perform an a posteriori interpolation switching from a kernel λ1 in the slow region to a kernel λ2 elsewhere by means of the formula 36 f 1 ω s l o w f λ 1 1 ω f a s t f λ 2 where ω f a s t 1 1 ω s l o w 1 being the characteristic function of the set denoted in the index when considering a low permeability medium or when applying the kozeny carman law 2 the superficial velocity of eq 3 scales as ε 2 k 0 the boundary layer scales as ε k 0 with the right hand side scaling as ε this means that the slow region owing to the archie s law is also the region of the weakest species diffusion when applying the remeshing procedure it is consequently a good strategy to use a non diffusive kernel in the slow region whose lack of sign preservation will not affect particles at quasi rest use a sign preserving kernel in the fast region whose diffusion dr can be predicted and used to correct the diffusion coefficient σk ε in practice we will apply formula 36 with m 4 in the fast region and m 4 in the slow region 37 f 1 ω s l o w f m 4 1 ω f a s t f m 4 in combination with the corrected diffusion coefficient 38 σ k ε σ k ε 1 ω f a s t m 4 1 h 2 δ t the correction term is the d dimensional equivalent of eq 27 for the diffusion induced by remeshing with kernel m 4 it can be observed that this correction is evaluated by means of particles at rest inducing the value m 4 1 this may be improved by considering the local topology of the particle network but at the cost of a great deal of computational time the present solution has no computational cost and is shown see section 5 1 to already dramatically improve the convergence of the method 4 computational aspects and gpu implementation 4 1 numerical method the transport diffusion reaction equations are solved by the lagrangian method 17 described above including the correction 37 38 and the resulting dynamical system is solved by a runge kutta fourth order method at each sub step its velocity field can be obtained by solving the darcy brinkman stokes equation in its formulation 4 after introducing the vorticity ω u and the operator a u v 2 d u v δ u v we can see that d i v 2 μ d u a u μ μ δ ω for a constant viscosity μ a u μ 0 so the solution of the dbs equation is obtained as the limit of the following sequence 39 ω n 1 ω n q μ δ ω n 1 q μ k 0 1 1 ε 2 ε 2 u n 0 where q is a descent parameter whose dimension is a mass per unit of time with the boundary conditions mentioned in section 2 the consistency of this fixed point method is discussed in hume and poncet 2020 in the event of variable viscosity this method can be easily generalized by adding the source term a u n μ the velocity at the next time step is then recovered either by 40 δ u n 1 ω n 1 or by 41 δ ψ n 1 ω n 1 followed by u n 1 ψ n 1 including the lift velocity at the boundary conditions providing the driving force these sequences 39 and 40 or 39 41 are always evaluated after a remeshing step so that all the differential operators are computed by straightforward finite difference schemes fourth order since the remeshed particle network is structured these last three equations are implicit and involve non separable poisson equation solved fusing the mudpack solver based on fast fourier transforms fft and tchebitchev polynomials adams 1993 these algorithms complexity scale as o n log n where n is the number of particles coinciding with the number of underlying grid points of the remeshed particle network for more details see hejlesen et al 2015 cottet et al 2014b molins et al 2020 ossmani and poncet 2010 for the velocity vorticity formulation and sanchez et al 2019 chatelin and poncet 2013 for the velocity pressure formulation remeshing and finite difference schemes are processed direction by direction magni and cottet 2012 which corresponds to a second level of fractional steps algorithms in the present simulations we use the sequence 39 41 whose numerical solution algebraically satisfies d i v u n 1 d i v ψ n 1 0 since the discrete operators of finite difference schemes satisfy div 0 exactly note that to satisfy this property for the sequence 39 and 40 staggered grids are required but by using colocation the state variable is aligned with the microct scan data once the velocity has been updated the chemical system 17 in its lagrangian form is pushed to the next time step by means of a runge kutta second or fourth order scheme diffusion is computed by a finite difference scheme as mentioned above an important consequence of the lagrangian formulation is that it removes the transport terms in eq 17 hence removing as well its stability condition leading to aparticularly robust method lastly the resulting particles carrying the chemical state variable are remeshed on the underlying uniform grid which has no impact on the divergence free velocity field and the next time step can begin fig 2 shows the directed acyclic graph for these temporal iterations 4 2 hybrid cpu gpu implementation the numerical applications presented below where performed using an in house code which is due to be being open source and is currently in its first release candidate version the software is a generic high performance hybrid computing code for remeshed particle methods the entire code is based on an operator splitting strategy where each operator is solved with the most appropriate numerical method currently all the methods considered are cartesian grid based methods such as finite difference spectral and remeshed particle methods the actual development started with the introduction of high order remeshing formulas well suited to gpu implementation using opencl etancelin 2014 cottet et al 2014a more recently the code has been successfully used for passive control of bluff body flows mimeau et al 2017 and for sediment flow simulations keck 2019 in the next paragraphs we briefly describe the key features of the library the overall structure of the library is written in python so as to benefit from object oriented programming and high level interfaces with utilities such as data representation on cartesian grids mpi opencl compiled languages interoperability symbolic computations and hdf5 parallel i o through the python packages numpy mpi4py pyopencl f2py sympy and h5py using the code consists in defining the different operators that act on several variables defined on a computational domain the operators are obtained by equations splitting the variables are either present in the equations or intermediate variables this high level of abstraction is designed to solve problems regardless of the architecture and discrete models used in practice the problem description must be formalized as a directed acyclic graph of operators that defines a temporal iteration of the semi discrete equations where vertices represent the operators and edges represent the dependencies between operators operators are defined along with their numerical discretization numerical method parameters and targeted architecture the graph is automatically completed in order to insert appropriate low level operators and ensure data consistency of variables across the different discretization characteristics and architecture once the graph is defined the gpu targeted operators are being initialized by means of automatic code generation and performance auto tuning gpu kernels code is generated either using simple text formatting capabilities or abstract syntax trees from a symbolic representation of variables the former is used in case of complex algorithms generated by numerical methods while the latter is mostly used for vectorization of simple expressions the autotuning of the gpu kernels ensures optimal use of resources thanks to the adjustment of kernel parameters with discretization and hardware capabilities finally data locality is managed automatically in the case accelerated and distributed architectures gpu operators work on device mirrored data and memory coherence is maintained by the library itself thanks to the pyopencl package distributed architectures are handled by a fixed domain decomposition through mpi cartesian topologies all communication patterns can therefore be set up and optimized during the initialization phase 5 application to rock dissolution 5 1 validation of the fully coupled model to validate the proposed model the chemical reaction and the global model described in section 2 4 are considered based on the 2d benchmark described in molins et al 2020 it consists of a circular 1 porous calcite core of radius 0 01cm in a channel 0 05 cm wide and 0 1 cm long as shown in fig 3 exposed to hydrochloric acid injection at p h 2 and flow rate 0 12 cm s 1 periodic boundary conditions are set at the top and bottom walls which by symmetry are equivalent to free slip and no slip through boundary conditions for both the hydrodynamics and the species transport including acid and products in fig 4 a and b we compare the spatial distribution of the acid concentration at two points in time for diffusive top half and diffusion corrected simulations bottom half the most obvious difference is that the concentration gradient is spread out over a larger distance in the diffusive case a closer look shows that the contour of the crystal is also slightly different i e more elongated relative to the direction of flow in the corrected case grain size evolution defined as the volume inside the 0 5 level of porosity is represented in fig 4c it is clear that the simulations based on adaptive a posteriori kernel selection and a corrected diffusion coefficient yield similar results on all considered the meshes considered predicting the time of complete dissolution at around t 4200 in accordance with results from molins et al 2020 even on the finest discretization considered the simulations using diffusive remeshing overestimate the time needed for complete dissolution moreover comparison of the contour at t 45 min with the contours from molins et al 2020 in fig 4d shows that the grain shape isovalue at ε 0 5 is quite similar whether we use the corrected method in blue or not in light green the practical advantages of correction are consequently to avoid the appearance of fuzzy solid see fig 4c for instance to increase reliability since convergence is much improved when using the correction the curves at 128 256 and 256 512 are superimposed in fig 4c it is also worth noting that the present method does not need to be constrained by the reaction to be located at the interface as it is commonly performed in dissolution simulations 5 2 dissolution of a non percolating 3d carbonate rock the second case focuses on the impact of dissolution on the hydraulic properties of carbonates the rock studied is indiana limestone an almost pure outcrop rock composed of 99 calcite the initial geometry of the rock is provided by ferreira et al through the digital rocks portal ferreira et al 2020a 2020b based on the methodology outlined in arns et al 2019 the concept of backgroud porosity ferreira et al argue that none of the voxels are pore free at the resolution used they conclude in a 5 porosity for the solid matrix which is fully compatible with the present formalism by setting ε 0 05 in the solid region this type of sample is especially challenging as it comprises both pores and a porous but non percolating rock matrix by non percolating we mean that the pure fluid region ε 1 is not continuous between the inlet and outlet faces in this work the gray level g of each voxel is converted into a porosity field ε as follows 42 ε 1 if 1 g g p t 1 0 05 g t s g g t s g p t α 0 05 if g p t g g t s 0 05 if g t s g 2 16 where the grey level thresholds between the pores and the transition zone g p t 9000 and between the transition zone and the solid phase g t s 12 000 are visually determined based on an image analysis and where the exponent α 2 25 is calibrated such that the overall porosity of the rock corresponds to the measured porosity of 14 9 ferreira et al 2020a 2020b the initial geometry is characterized by an absolute permeability of k 10 14 m2 the specific reactive area is computed from an estimation of the pore solid interface so that a s 1582 m 1 the other simulation parameters are summarized in table 1 in this example the following pclet and damkhler numbers are considered 43 p u k d m 2 and d a i i r d m a s 6 3 10 6 and are expected to lead to wormhole formation soulaine et al 2017 the goal of the present study is to measure permeability evolution throughout the dissolution process so several macroscopic indicators were computed as shown in fig 7 we first computed a porosity estimate ϕ of our sample based on the pores volume as ϕ ω ε d v the estimation of the permeability k is derived directly from the darcy s law as 44 k μ u x f where is a volume averaged quantity and ux is the velocity in the flow direction the term f f p since p 0 is not computed in the method because of the velocity vorticity formulation of the dbs eq 4 consequently we reconstructed this quantity through eq 8 from the computed values of ux with second order finite differences one can see that if the fluid region ω fluid is defined where ε 1 and ε 0 elsewhere hence considering a fluid solid partition then ϕ tends towards the volume of ω fluid and u tends towards 0 in the solid region so that the usual definition of permeability is obtained lim ε 0 k μ ϕ f ω f l u i d u x d v finally the following averaged quantities c 2 and c 3 where also computed indicating the overall behavior of the chemical species from the raw dataset we extracted a sample of 5123 voxels placed in a non reactive and non permeable solid casing this region denoted ω is defined as a quartic cylinder of radius 11 mm in direction x as shown in fig 5 the choice of using a casing was made to improve the regularity of the geometry of domains to maximize the useful volume of data the sample was taken at the same resolution as the raw data i e voxels of size 0 045263 mm3 based on the sample data an estimated porosity value of 15 6 was obtained which is close to the global rock porosity after the first iteration of the method the initial flow field was characterized and an averaged velocity in direction x of u x 2 045 10 5 m s 1 was measured which corresponds to a mass flow rate of 10 981 ml s 1 an initial permeability of k 2 62 10 14 m2 was obtained based on an estimation of the driving force of f 7 80 10 5 nm 3 which is in a good accordance with the overall absolute permeability this value may be sensitive to the choice of gray scale conversion 42 from microct images in order to simulate the effect of fluid inclusions what gray et al 2018 refer to as detailed structure versus the homogeneous equivalent material we focused on a sub sample of 1283 voxels that is characterized by the presence of a large pore in a crescent shape as illustrated in fig 6 in this sub sample we enforced boundary conditions inherited from the superficial velocity of the full sample and began the simulation at t 0 with the acid inlet at p h 2 as for the full sample as expected for the pclet damkhler regimes the acid flows created a dominant wormhole through the calcite connecting high porosity regions as shown in fig 8a the dissolution process leads to an increase in porosity over time a dramatic change occurs once the first wormhole reaches the opposite end of the sample material the acid flow fills the opened pores and digs through the calcite in the regions with the lowest local porosity as a result the overall acidity rises over time as shown in fig 8b the sample considered contains a large open regular shaped pore that explains the nearly constant evolution of products concentration during digging times once the dominant wormhole becomes a through hole jumps in both permeability and concentration can be observed when the wormhole is complete the acid is expected to no longer be fully consumed according to ferreira et al 2020b 5 3 dissolution of a percolating 3d carbonate rock the third case focuses on the dissolution of a castlegate sandstone sample sheppard and prodanovic 2015 at a resolution of 2563 voxels displayed on the right picture of fig 8 this dataset is used only as an input geometry and we assume the same 5 porosity for the solid matrix as in section 5 2 so that here the initial porosity is larger than the estimation from sheppard and prodanovic 2015 the voxel size is 5 63 µm3 giving a sample of 1 43 mm wide in this case the black and white image is simply converted to bang bang values for ε an inlet velocity of u 2 10 5 m s 1 was enforced corresponding to a mass flow rate of 0 164 µl s 1 the specific reactive area is estimated from the pore solid interface so that a s 8288 m 1 and the molecular diffusion is set at d m 10 10 m2 s 1 together with a dissolution constant k s 10 2 the absolute permeability of the sample is unknown but an estimated initial permeability of k 1 22 10 11 m 2 was obtained with a driving force of f 603 nm 3 and the initial porosity is computed at ϕ 0 284 this case is characterized by p e 0 7 and d a i i 1 2 10 4 that is to say d a i 1 7 10 4 the evolution of permeability and porosity are shown on fig 8 we can observe more regularity than for the non percolating geometry studied in the previous section since there is no break through process 50 h of dissolution are simulated making the porosity grow from 28 to 70 associated to an increase of permeability furthermore one can observe a dramatic growth of permeability once the porosity reaches 50 around 20 h at such a high dahmkhler number the dissolution regime is expected to be driven by the peclet number according to soulaine et al 2017 their figure 15 on page 476 we expect conical wormholes in the present simulation the typical feature of 0 01 pe 1 and dai 1 with a pclet number close to the dominant wormhole regime to the opposite of the synthetic configurations considered in soulaine et al 2017 the present real geometry exhibits a natural ramified structure consequently leading to an apparently ramified wormholing as shown on fig 10 up to 12 h nevertheless long time scales more than 40 h in our simulation lead to a set of a few conical wormholes the evolution of the rock matrix is specifically displayed on the bottom pictures of fig 10 in order to identify more clearly the regime occurring the time derivation of the local porosity ε t is displayed on the fig 9 at time t 12 3 h showing that the dissolution is occurring at the fluid solid interface and not dispatch over all the pores featuring a collection of individual conical wormholes finally if the pclet number was based on a typical size of pore throats counting roughly 5 pores in the sample width its resulting value would be 82 time larger and the coherence with the pclet number based on the permeability may deserve to be investigated 6 conclusions and perspectives this study focused on the accurate simulation of dissolution processes at pore scale this paper presents a transport diffusion dissolution model that consistently couples a lagrangian formulation for the reaction equations with the superficial velocity formalism introduced by quintard and whitaker the present study shows that a posteriori kernel selection makes if possible to reconcile accurate interpolation and sign preservation the main outcome is that the method benefits from the quality of particle tracking for the transport the quality of the particle distribution through the remeshing procedure and the accurate computation of the diffusion owing to its adaptation to the choice of remeshing kernel this adaptative diffusion was performed in two steps first by selecting a remeshing kernel as a function of the local porosity in order to maximize the interpolation order in fast regions and minimize the spurious diffusion in the rock matrix physically small due to archie s law second by adjusting the diffusion coefficient using an a posteriori estimation of the spurious diffusion induced by the remeshing procedure the robust method developed in this article could be extended naturally to the computation of reactions between fluids with an heterogeneous rheology or plasticity and to precipitation and crystallization processes future studies will focus on the different dissolution regimes in rocks exhibiting ramified pore structures in order to build
