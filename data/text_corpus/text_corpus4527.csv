22635,a rigid oscillator of square cross section at zero incidence is susceptible to galloping motion depending on the mass ratio m of the oscillator the oscillations may be vortex induced viv or alternately vortex induced at low reynolds numbers r e and galloping at higher r e for r e 250 the mass ratio at which the motion turns from viv only to the one with combined viv and galloping is determined via space time finite element computations in two dimensions for 3 m 4 this choice of m range is driven by the conclusion drawn by sen and mittal 2015 that the value of transition mass ratio lies between 1 and 5 for free undamped vibrations of a square cylinder simultaneously along and across the flow the transition occurs when the value of m equals 3 4 there exists an essential interdependence between the onset of galloping and presence of secondary hysteresis at m 3 4 keywords square cylinder space time finite element vortex induced vibrations galloping transition mass ratio periodic and quasi periodic 1 introduction the free or vortex induced vibrations viv of a flexibly mounted rigid obstacle immersed in a moving viscous fluid is the most common type of fluid structure interaction fsi bluff oscillators of any shape undergo viv provided they possess sufficient afterbody or extent of material body beyond the separation points bearman et al 1987 corless and parkinson 1988 galloping motion on the other hand is a self excited fsi executed by oscillators of non axisymmetric cross section cui et al 2015 the basic non circular cylinders that execute low frequency strouhal number s t 1 corless and parkinson 1988 and high amplitude galloping motion are triangular alonso et al 2012 rectangular robertson et al 2003 cui et al 2015 square amandolese and hemon 2010 sen and mittal 2011 2015 2016 he et al 2012 cui et al 2015 etc such cylinders execute viv as well bearman et al 1987 the amplitude of viv is self limiting in nature limiting normalized amplitude is of the order of unity whereas in galloping instability the response builds up with rising incident flow speed the oscillation amplitude of a circular cylinder executing viv is of the order of its diameter whereas for an ice coated circular transmission cable the galloping response reaches even 100 times the diameter corless and parkinson 1988 for fsi in an incompressible fluid medium blevins 1990 listed seven key non dimensional parameters that depict the vibrations these are body geometry reduced speed normalized amplitude mass ratio reynolds number damping factor and turbulent intensity in the context of vortex induced motion of a given oscillator in the two dimensional laminar flow regime the controlling parameters are 1 reduced speed u the reference free stream speed u normalized by the oscillator natural frequency f n and characteristic dimension d of the oscillator it is expressed as u u f n d the reciprocal of reduced speed is known as reduced natural frequency f n 2 mass ratio m the ratio of the mass of the oscillator m per unit length to the mass of the displaced fluid m is proportional to the m ρ d 2 ratio where ρ is the density of the fluid 3 reynolds number r e it equals the product u d ν where ν is the kinematic viscosity of the fluid 4 damping factor ζ expressed as c 2 k m here c and k respectively denote the damping and stiffness of the oscillator system the present numerical investigation relates to the transition of viv to combined viv and galloping of a square section oscillator in the subsequent paragraphs an account is provided on the earlier studies concerning viv and galloping of a square cylinder the objectives of the current investigation follows thereafter parkinson and smith 1964 proposed a quasi steady theory to model aerodynamic loading on a structure undergoing one degree of freedom galloping for various values of u they presented results for response of a symmetric square cylinder executing galloping in wind bearman et al 1987 conducted experiments for flow induced vibrations of a square cylinder in a wind tunnel for the first time they reported the existence of a kink in the response curve of a square cylinder near u 6 π they also observed an 1 3 sub harmonic synchronization in the kink region corless and parkinson 1988 proposed a semi empirical model to predict the interactions between viv and galloping to this end they combined the hartlen curie model of viv with parkinson and smith s 1964 quasi steady model of galloping by employing a stabilized finite element formulation su et al 2007 perhaps for the first time investigated the free transverse vibrations of a square cylinder of m 10 for undamped motion they presented results for response and fluid forcing at r e 100 for m 905 and 5 u 20 amandolese and hemon 2010 performed aeroelastic experiments on transverse only vibrations of a rigid square cylinder of low structural damping the range of reynolds number was 2000 8000 sen and mittal 2011 numerically investigated over r e 60 250 free undamped vibrations simultaneous in line and cross stream of a rigid square cylinder of m 10 they noted that the motion of cylinder is viv at low r e followed by galloping at high r e he et al 2012 numerically studied the transverse only motion of a square cylinder at r e 250 using m 20 ζ 0 0037 f n 0 025 and u 6 20 40 and 80 for simultaneous in line and transverse free undamped translations of a square cylinder of m 10 they resolved the galloping motion but could not capture the c 2s and 2p 2s wake modes identified by sen and mittal 2011 2015 by considering two additional mass ratios of 5 and 20 he et al 2012 briefly explored the effects of mass ratio on two degrees of freedom viv galloping characteristics based on forced vibration experiments on a circular cylinder williamson and roshko 1988 introduced the nomenclature for various wake vortex modes following the interactions among vortices shed in an oscillation cycle by s williamson and roshko 1988 denoted a single vortex while the symbol p was used to signify a pair of vortices of opposite signs accordingly the basic karman mode of vortex shedding was designated by the symbol 2s thus 2s signifies the basic mode in which a pair of opposite signed vortices are shed in an oscillation cycle the coalescence of 2s vortices in the near wake gives rise to the c 2s mode where c stands for coalescence in 2p 2s mode a pair of opposite signed vortices along with a single vortex shed from either side of the oscillator in a half oscillation cycle therefore a total of six vortices three of them clockwise and rest three counter clockwise constitute the 2p 2s mode by incorporating a quasi steady model joly et al 2012 studied the low r e transverse galloping of a square cylinder for m 1 2 3 4 5 10 15 and 20 they concluded that the critical reynolds number for the onset of galloping in a square cylinder is 140 a value noticeably different than those predicted by barrero gil et al 2009 and sen and mittal 2015 transverse only vibrations of a square cylinder of low mass ratio m 2 2 were experimentally studied by nemes et al 2012 the values of input parameters employed were ζ 2 95 1 0 3 r e 2500 12500 and the angle of incidence was varied from 0 to 45 they noted that motion of the cylinder was viv for 45 incidence and it was galloping for 0 incidence this observation is in agreement with the findings of later experimental investigation by zhao et al 2014a over a narrow regime of intermediate angles of incidence nemes et al 2012 identified a new response branch where the magnitude of response exceeded those obtained from viv or galloping for symmetric 0 and 45 as well as asymmetric 20 angles of incidence zhao et al 2014a conducted high r e experiments concerning flow induced vibrations a low mass ratio of 2 64 was used in consistency with the results of nemes et al 2012 zhao et al 2014a found that the angle of incidence is a key parameter that governs the type of motion to be induced in the oscillator cui et al 2015 employed finite element treatment of two dimensional reynolds averaged navier stokes equations and the k ω turbulence equations to study the flow induced transverse vibrations of a square cylinder for angles of incidence 0 22 5 and 45 and a rectangular cylinder for angles of incidence 0 45 and 90 of aspect ratio 0 5 for each cross section the mass ratio was fixed to 2 4 the motion of the square cylinder with zero incidence was found to be overwhelmingly galloping and for other angles viv was predominant for the rectangular cylinder galloping was prominent for 0 and 90 and viv for 45 incidence the literature presented above essentially suggests that bulk of the research focussed on a single mass ratio of the square cylinder the brief results relating to effects of m on flow and motion of a square cylinder reported by he et al 2012 do not also lead to the concept of the existence of a transition m since they did not consider a sufficiently low m the den hartog stability criterion requires that c y α 0 joly et al 2012 for occurrence of galloping the lateral force c y is computed for a stationary square cylinder oriented at different angles of incidence α close to 0 hence this condition is independent of the mass of the cylinder owing to this the den hartog criterion that is satisfied by the square section does not take into account the role of m hence it is not clear that this is an absolute condition for occurrence of galloping it appears that the oscillator mass ratio is a key parameter that in addition to the den hartog criterion also governs the possibility of galloping it is highly likely that even after satisfying the c y α 0 condition a square cylinder of sufficiently low m may not gallop as discussed above depending on the angle of incidence the motion of a square with sharp corners may be viv galloping or other than viv galloping nemes et al 2012 zhao et al 2014a cui et al 2015 the implication is that the existence of galloping of a square cylinder is a function of its mass ratio angle of incidence and reynolds number or reduced speed it is discussed later in section 5 3 6 that material damping also influences the transition to galloping the role of m on the two degrees of freedom motion of a rigid square cylinder was investigated in details by sen and mittal 2015 via finite element computations for r e 50 250 they studied the free undamped motion of m 1 5 10 and 20 cylinders at zero incidence the cylinder with m 1 executes pure viv while the motion for m 5 is initially viv and galloping thereafter a natural conclusion they therefore had is that the transition from viv only motion to combined viv and galloping occurs at an m that lies between 1 and 5 they also predicted that a square cylinder of arbitrary m cannot gallop below r e 165 687 and u 11 514 the corresponding value of r e predicted by barrero gil et al 2009 was 159 zhao et al 2013 performed finite element simulations of the flow and rigid body equations at r e 100 to explore the vortex induced vibrations of an m 3 square cylinder the reduced speed was varied from 1 to 30 and angles of incidence considered were 0 22 5 and 45 galloping was not seen for any orientation of the oscillator the absence of galloping for zero incidence even well beyond u 11 514 is consistent with quite lower value of r e 165 687 used by zhao et al 2013 a substance of interest therefore evolves around the existence of a certain m below which galloping instability for zero incidence configuration gets suppressed this forms the background for the current numerical investigation the primary objective of this current study is to determine the value of the mass ratio below which galloping motion is not induced in a square cylinder at zero incidence for r e 250 to meet this objective undamped two degrees of freedom motions of a square cylinder is computed for r e 60 250 and a blockage b of 5 blockage is a non dimensional quantity defined as the ratio of width of the body across the flow to the width of the computational domain the relationship f n 14 39 r e or r e 14 39 u coupling the reduced speed and reynolds number is also used the remaining of the document is set in the following manner the governing equations for incompressible fluid flow and motion of rigid body are discussed in section 2 section 3 contains a brief description of the space time finite element formulation the problem statement adequacy of mesh and size of time step are detailed in section 4 this section also provides a detailed discussion of validation of the predicted results the main results are presented in section 5 finally in section 6 few concluding remarks are made 2 the governing equations 2 1 the incompressible flow equations let ω t r 2 and 0 t respectively denote the spatial and temporal domains while γ t i e the boundary of ω t is piecewise smooth the spatial and temporal coordinates are denoted by x x y and t respectively in strong form the coordinate free navier stokes equations of motion governing incompressible flow are 1 ρ u t u u σ 0 on ω t 0 t 2 u 0 on ω t 0 t here u u v and σ are the velocity and stress tensor respectively the constitutive relation for stress tensor in terms of its isotropic or inviscid component p i and deviatoric or viscous component t is 3 σ p i t t 2 μ ε u ε u 1 2 u u t where p i μ and ε are the pressure identity tensor dynamic viscosity of the fluid and strain rate tensor respectively both the essential dirichlet and natural neumann type boundary conditions are considered the initial condition on the velocity field is 4 u x 0 u 0 on ω 0 where u 0 is divergence free i e u 0 satisfies eq 2 signifying conservation of mass 2 2 equations of motion for an elastically mounted rigid square cylinder the two degrees of freedom translations of an oscillator are governed by newton s second law of motion along the in line and cross stream directions expressed as 5 m x y c x y k x y f x t f y t for 0 t here x t and y t stand for dimensional streamwise and transverse displacements of the oscillator respectively these displacements are measured relative to the origin of the fixed coordinate system see fig 1a in eq 5 differentiation with respect to t is represented by a dot in the above dimensional odes the terms in the left hand side stand for inertia force viscous damping and restoring force respectively the instantaneous forcing terms f x t and f y t on the right hand side act at the fluid solid interface and couple the flow and rigid body equations these instantaneous forces are computed by summing up the elemental traction forces at the fluid solid interface the square section oscillator is flexibly mounted and fully immersed in a moving viscous fluid fig 1a normalization of the spatial scale is performed by the characteristic dimension d here d is the edge length of the square cylinder the temporal scale is normalized by u and d the instantaneous drag coefficient c d t f x t 0 5 ρ u 2 d and instantaneous lift coefficient c l t f y t 0 5 ρ u 2 d in the absence of viscous damping the normalized equations of rigid body translation along and across the flow obtained from eq 5 are 6 x 2 π f n 2 x c d 2 m for 0 t 7 y 2 π f n 2 y c l 2 m for 0 t the initial conditions for the above odes are 8 x 0 0 y 0 0 x 0 0 and y 0 0 or the cylinder is initially at rest at the 0 0 location for each m the above initial conditions are employed at the lowest r e considered i e r e 60 and as r e is changed solutions available at the nearest r e are used as initial conditions the details of normalization of eqs 6 and 7 have been presented in kumar et al 2018a the numerical experiments are performed by setting the value of natural frequency of the oscillator equal to the corresponding stationary vortex shedding frequency 0 1439 of the square cylinder at r e 100 from here one obtains the inverse relationships between f n and r e as f n 14 39 r e 3 the finite element formulation a stabilized space time finite element formulation accommodating equal order interpolation for velocity and pressure is used in the present study the interpolation functions are bilinear in space and linear in time globally these interpolation functions are continuous in space but discontinuous in time details of the space time finite element formulation can be found in tezduyar et al 1992a b the stabilization parameters are defined in tezduyar et al 1992c apart from the equations of fluid flow the equations of motion for the oscillator given by eqs 6 and 7 are also cast in the space time formulation details of this are available in tezduyar et al 1992b and mittal 1992 4 problem description convergence tests and validation 4 1 problem statement fig 1a depicts the problem set up for free undamped translations of a rigid square cylinder at zero incidence simultaneously along and across the flow a fluid domain of rectangular shape and size 54 d 20 d is truncated in which the cylinder resides at the onset of cylinder motion location of its centre coincides with the origin of the cartesian coordinate system the x y coordinate system is stationary i e not fixed to the body or the frame of reference is inertial this implies that x x t and y y t the width of the computational domain 20 d corresponds to a blockage of 5 relative to the origin of the coordinate system the upstream and downstream boundaries are located at distances of 24 d and 30 d respectively the boundary conditions employed are free stream inlet slip lateral boundaries stress free exit and no slip fluid solid interface the no slip condition on velocity at the cylinder surface is time dependent and this condition along with fluid forcing couple the flow and rigid body equations a multi block structured mesh consisting of five mesh blocks each of which is composed of bilinear quadrilateral elements is used for domain discretization irrespective of the value of mass ratio the mesh contains 24149 nodes and 23780 bilinear quadrilateral elements while the number of nodes on cylinder surface n t equals 240 the mesh is adaptive in nature it needs reconstruction at each time step such that the outer domain boundary and coordinate system remain fixed with respect to time fig 1b shows the undeformed mesh 4 2 tests for mesh convergence and time step size the computations in the present study have been performed by using the same numerical tool as used by sen 2010 and sen and mittal 2011 for undamped two degrees of freedom motions of a rigid square oscillator of mass ratio 10 sen and mittal 2011 discussed the mesh convergence at r e 90 corresponding to moderate amplitude oscillations in the lower branch of response to establish mesh independence of the computed results they reported results on two meshes m1 and m2 the mesh m1 contains 24149 nodes 23780 bilinear quadrilateral elements and 240 nodes on the cylinder surface for mesh m2 with roughly double the resolution of m1 respective values of these variables are 46256 nodes 45744 bilinear quadrilateral elements and 296 surface nodes table 1 of sen and mittal 2011 demonstrated the sufficiency of mesh m1 for free vibration computations of the square oscillator the present computations have been performed entirely on mesh m1 for m 10 and identical problem set up as considered in this study sen 2010 tested the effect of time step size t on undamped viv characteristics of a rigid square cylinder at r e 90 the discussion and table presented here on adequacy of time step size have been reproduced from sen 2010 for computations on mesh m1 two values of time step size were considered i e t u d 0 03 and 0 015 table 1 below summarizes the results for test of adequacy of time step size as apparent from this table the characteristic flow viv quantities display insensitivity to normalized time step size smaller than 0 03 a maximum deviation of about 3 57 is found for x r m s thus sufficiency of t u d 0 03 for the present set of computations is established based on the mesh and time sensitivity tests all the computations in this work have been performed on mesh m1 using a normalized time step size of 0 03 4 3 validation of results to the best of the knowledge of the authors no experimental result is currently available for viv of a square cylinder over the range of r e considered in the present work owing to this the validation is performed relative to the computational results available in the literature the results presented by sen and mittal 2011 in context of undamped two degrees of freedom free vibrations of a rigid square cylinder of m 10 were used by he et al 2012 for validation of their proposed combined interface boundary condition cibc method tables 12 and 13 of he et al 2012 display the comparison and a close agreement of parameters such as response forces and frequency from the two sets of computations is quite obvious in this work we have conducted at r e 100 and u 5 validation test of the computed results with other results available zhao et al 2013 jaiman et al 2016 both of these studies consider two degrees of freedom viv at r e 100 in the literature for a freely vibrating rigid square cylinder at zero and 45 angles of incidence in each case m 3 and ζ 0 zhao et al 2013 explored the viv of a square cylinder at zero and 45 incidences while jaiman et al 2016 considered the case of zero incidence for u 5 table 2 compares the predicted y m a x d with those reported by zhao et al 2013 and jaiman et al 2016 the closeness of the comparison establishes the accuracy of the predicted results the studies by sen and mittal 2011 he et al 2012 zhao et al 2013 jaiman et al 2016 as well as the present study are all based on finite element computations the present study employs implicit time stepping and hence the size of time step is not restricted by the cfl condition for each of the studies discussed above table 3 lists the values of time step size total number of nodes and of elements in the mesh for the current computations convergence for mesh resolution and time step size have been discussed in section 4 2 5 results using a blockage of 5 results concerning undamped free vibrations of a square cylinder for 3 m 4 are presented using two dimensional computations over 60 r e 250 the element level matrix and vector entries are computed by employing the 2 2 2 points gauss legendre quadrature rule within each time step the discretized flow equations are solved by using the gmres iterative solver developed by saad and schultz 1986 for asymmetric matrix equation systems while the second order odes for oscillator motion are solved via numerical integration see mittal and tezduyar 1994 two sets of computations are performed for each m these correspond to calculations along increasing and decreasing r e for which solutions from lower and higher r e respectively are used as initial guess this is done to examine the existence of hysteresis or solution multiplicity in flow and characteristics of rigid body motion irrespective of m the lowest value of r e for occurrence of galloping is of the order of 150 while the minimum reduced speed is 11 514 discussed in details later in section 5 3 1 we therefore choose the upper limit of r e such that it exceeds 150 and similarly the maximum value of u exceeds 11 514 following the observation of sen and mittal 2015 that the motion of the cylinder with unit mass ratio is purely viv and it is a combination of viv and galloping for m 5 we first explore the motion of the m 3 cylinder the response for m 3 fig 2b of this paper turns out to be very similar to that of m 1 see figure 3a of sen and mittal 2015 this confirms that the mass ratio marking the transition from viv only motion to combined viv and galloping for 150 r e 250 and 11 514 u 250 14 39 17 37 lies between 3 and 5 5 1 overview of viv and flow characteristics for m 3 5 1 1 synchronization and response for m 3 fig 2a illustrates the reynolds number or reduced speed dependence of cylinder oscillation frequency s t y and vortex shedding frequency s t c l over the entire range of r e the frequencies converge 1 1 synchronization between transverse oscillations and vortex shedding ensuring that motion of the oscillator is periodic with single dominant frequency the phenomenon of lock in or synchronization implies oneness of the cylinder oscillation frequency vortex shedding frequency and natural frequency of the cylinder williamson and govardhan 2004 for an oscillator of high mass ratio lock in suggests that the frequency ratio or ratio of the cylinder oscillation frequency to its natural frequency closely approaches the value of unity for m 3 cylinder the response consists of the initial branch lower branch and desynchronization or decoherence regime by analysing the viv response of an elliptic cylinder navrose et al 2014 further decomposed the region of desynchronization or out of resonance or lock in into its dsi and dsii components according to navrose et al 2014 an oscillator undergoes low amplitude normalized response 0 03 oscillations in the first regime of desynchronization or dsi this regime occurs prior to the onset of lock in the second regime of desynchronization or dsii exists close to the upper extremity of resonance or lock in this is also a low amplitude region amplitude exceeds that of dsi whose extent appreciably surpasses that of dsi kumar et al 2018a recently proposed a method for identification of response branches and associated transitions from one branch to another this method relies on change of slope of the frequency curve for m 3 the first change of slope of s t y occurs at r e 72 this slope change marks the transition from the first regime of desynchronization dsi to initial branch a jump discontinuity to s t y 0 1564 at r e 73 from s t y 0 1433 at r e 72 signifies the onset of lock in unlike the cases of higher m i e 5 the jump however does not mark the beginning of lower branch since the slope of s t y r e profile remains the same till r e 74 therefore the initial branch extends from r e 72 to 74 the second transition or transition from initial to lower branch follows the subsequent slope change of s t y and is found to take place at r e 75 at this juncture s t y attains its peak value of 0 1614 during lock in s t y initially rises in initial branch and then drops in lower branch the third final slope change or transition from lower branch to the second regime of desynchronization dsii occurs at r e 96 where both s t y and s t c l become minimum 0 1508 post lock in this is the closure of lock in s t continues to rise with r e in dsii as noted for a fixed cylinder overall s t ranges roughly between 0 12 and 0 19 for galloping of m 5 10 and 20 square cylinders over r e 50 250 sen and mittal 2015 found that the value of s t y is one order of magnitude lower i e it hovers around 0 06 the later study by sen and mittal 2016 suggests that galloping at its inception involves quasi periodicity the order of magnitude of s t y and absence of quasi periodicity underscore that motion of the m 3 cylinder is pure viv the variation of maximum transverse response y m a x d is depicted in fig 2b the maximum response of 0 3029 d is attained at r e 74 post lock in considering forward r e as well as backward r e solutions sen and mittal 2015 earlier demonstrated that irrespective of m the maximum transverse response of a square cylinder is practically constant to 0 3 d for the present case of pure viv with m 3 it is noted that occurrence of maximum y m a x d does not coincide with the onset of lock in or beginning of lower branch the x y lissajou diagrams signifying trajectory of the cylinder centre are double looped as shown at representative reynolds numbers of 80 fig 2c and 250 fig 2d for both cases the pair of loops implies that frequency of in line motion is twice the frequency of cross stream motion as discussed above lock out or closure of lock in occurs at r e 96 marking the termination of the lower branch and the dsii regime initiates at r e 96 for m 1 sen and mittal 2015 incorrectly labelled the corresponding response regime as lower branch fig 3a of their paper 5 1 2 the surface pressure c p the lower branch of resonance extends from r e 75 to 96 therefore vortex shedding is very strong and very weak near its lower and upper bounds respectively to examine the modifications of c p due to vortex shedding a set of two borderline reynolds numbers 75 and 95 is considered fig 3 illustrates for r e 75 the time series of surface pressure at the stagnation points and shoulders interestingly c p at stagnation points i e c p 0 and c p b displays time periodicity with single frequency and at the shoulders c p t and c p d it reveals time periodicity with multiple frequencies this behaviour is evident from the power spectra presented via fig 3c through 3f c p at the shoulders oscillate with cylinder oscillation frequency or frequency of lift of magnitude 0 1614 on the contrary at the stagnation points it oscillates with twice the cylinder oscillation frequency or frequency of drag c p is positive pressure directed towards the surface at the forward stagnation point and negative pressure is directed away from the surface at the other three points analysis of the time traces at the stagnation points reveals that c p 0 and c p b are almost in phase fig 3a the difference between mean values of c p 0 1 0789 and c p b 1 0055 is a measure of pressure recovery at cylinder base higher the difference lower the pressure recovery higher the drag and vice versa fig 3b indicates that surface pressure at the top and bottom shoulders is identical while being out of phase the out of phase relationship is consistent with the alternate shedding of opposite signed vortices from the upper and lower rear surfaces of the cylinder identical magnitude of mean c p at the shoulders tallies well with the zero mean value of transverse lift force maximum fluctuations in c p is associated in the direction of lift and minimum fluctuation is recorded by c p 0 therefore the r m s of lift is expected to surpass the magnitude of r m s of drag see section 5 1 3 since vortex shedding modifies the surface pressure distribution amplitudes of c p at two sets of diametrically opposite points underscore that modification of c p due to vortex shedding is dominant across the flow fig 4 illustrates the characteristics of surface pressure for r e 95 from here it is obvious that weak vortex shedding is unable to excite large fluctuations in the pressure signals figs 4a and 4b therefore the magnitudes of c d r m s and c l r m s fall drastically figs 6b and 6c compared to those at r e 75 comparison of figs 3a and 4a reveals that the effects of vibrations are more on c p b than on c p 0 stronger the vibrations lesser the c p b the mean values of c p 0 and c p b at r e 95 are 1 0438 and 0 7420 respectively the pressure recovery with high amplitude oscillations at r e 75 is therefore much lesser than pressure recovery with low amplitude oscillations at r e 95 this predicts a higher value of mean drag at r e 75 than at r e 95 fig 5a plots at r e 75 and fig 5b at r e 95 the distribution of time averaged c p along the oscillator surface in either case c p is maximum at the forward stagnation point e and minimum near the front corners a and b it is constant along the rear surface cd c p displays symmetry about the base point f a symmetry of mean surface pressure about the base point is indicative of anti symmetric vortex shedding in such cases an asymmetric wake vortex mode does not generate therefore at r e 75 and 95 the wake mode must be anti symmetric in section 5 1 4 it is shown that the mode is basic karman or 2s which is anti symmetric it is evident from fig 5 that the differential pressure between points e and f is higher for r e 75 than for r e 95 this further ascertains the higher recovery of pressure at base near the end of lock in 5 1 3 fluid forces the mean drag of the freely vibrating cylinder is shown in fig 6a along with its stationary counterpart except for dsi drag of the vibrating cylinder surpasses the drag of the stationary one at r e 80 the computations by jaiman et al 2015 for a fixed square cylinder at zero incidence yield c p 0 1 1277 and c p b 0 5726 for the freely vibrating square cylinder the values of c p 0 and c p b at a comparative r e of 75 see section 5 1 2 underscore that vibrations significantly reduce the value of c p b in addition pressure recovery with vibrations is much less as compared to those of a stationary cylinder this explains the higher drag with vibrating cylinders the relationship of r m s of drag with r e is depicted in fig 6b in general c d r m s is considerably smaller than c l r m s when vortex shedding is strong eg r e 75 it enhances the c p fluctuations more on the shoulders than at the stagnation points figs 3a and 3b hence c l r m s exceeds c d r m s when vortex shedding is weak eg r e 95 c p fluctuations at the shoulders fall drastically fig 4b for such cases c d r m s surpasses c l r m s as apparent from the discussions in section 5 1 2 stronger the vortex shedding larger the fluctuations of c p at cylinder shoulders and larger the c l r m s therefore the magnitude of c l r m s indicates the strength of vortex shedding lam and wei 2010 yang and wu 2013 kumar et al 2018b fig 6c plots the r m s of lift with r e and u up to r e 75 i e for dsi initial branch and beginning of lower branch c l r m s rises monotonically implying gradual strengthening of vortex shedding subsequently c l r m s falls with r e and attains its least value at r e 96 where s t y is also minimum this suggests that vortex shedding at r e 96 is extremely weak the closure of lower branch lock in is hence associated with the occurrence of minimum of s t y as well as c l r m s in the dsii regime r e 96 c l r m s again rises with r e amplification of c l r m s however does not affect the response fig 2b since c l and y are out of phase in this regime of decoherence see section 5 3 9 c d c l lissajou diagrams shown in the insets of fig 6c for r e 75 95 and 240 further ascertain the periodic nature of the flow each phase plot suggests for a zero value of mean lift force the zero mean lift results from symmetric mean pressure distribution between the upper and lower surfaces of the square absence of unbalanced lift therefore suggests for zero mean y and shedding of identical but opposite signed vorticity in each shedding cycle for 1 1 synchronization the most common type of wake mode is 2s and its variant c 2s 5 1 4 wake modes of vortex formation figs 7a 7b and 7c respectively illustrate the wake vortex modes at r e 75 95 and 230 corresponding to high and low amplitude transverse displacements of the oscillator the instantaneous vorticity snapshots indicate that the wake modes are c 2s and 2s respectively this corroborates with the discussion in section 5 1 3 from these contours one can have an idea of relative strength of vortex shedding at the reynolds numbers considered as discussed in previous sub sections the magnitude of r m s lift is an indicator of the strength of vortex shedding higher the c l r m s higher is the strength and vice versa from fig 6c depicting the c l r m s r e relationship it is found that c l r m s at r e 75 c l r m s at r e 230 c l r m s at r e 95 therefore strength of vortex shedding is maximum at r e 75 corresponding to maximum oscillation frequency in lock in and minimum at r e 95 corresponding to minimum oscillation frequency in lock in this is consistent with the facts that the phenomenon of lock in enhances the strength of vortex shedding park 1981 and vibrations enhance the strength of vortices ferguson and parkinson 1967 toebes 1969 as apparent from fig 7 for comparable downstream distance the intervortex spacing is minimum for r e 75 and maximum for r e 95 it implies that in a given time interval the maximum number of vortices are shed at r e 75 followed by r e 230 and 95 in consistency with the relative magnitude of c l r m s at r e 75 95 and 230 this order of longitudinal intervortex spacing with r e indirectly suggests that vortex shedding is strongest at r e 75 followed by r e 230 and 95 for forced motion of a circular cylinder at r e 200 with frequencies other than the natural frequency koopmann 1967 experimentally found that the longitudinal spacing between wake vortices decreases at higher oscillation frequency at lower oscillation frequency this trend of spacing reversed in context of forced motion of a circular cylinder at r e 144 and 190 griffin and ramberg 1974 experimentally observed in the lock in regime that the lateral spacing of vortices in the wake depends on the oscillation amplitude higher the amplitude smaller the lateral spacing they further noted that the oscillation frequency affects the rate of vorticity generation as well as the ratio of lateral and longitudinal spacing of vortices in the wake thus governs the development of the wake in particular the longitudinal spacing between vortices was found to vary inversely with the oscillation frequency this explains the closeness of like sign wake vortices at r e 75 compared to those at r e 95 5 2 overview of vibration and flow characteristics for m 4 5 2 1 synchronization and response towards higher values of r e the s t r e curve undergoes significant modification as m is increased from 3 to 4 as illustrated in fig 8a for m 4 s t y and s t c l converge up to r e 197 this is the pre galloping regime comprising of dsi initial branch lower branch and dsii divergence of s t y from s t c l via a sharp drop of s t y at r e 198 or u 13 76 marks the onset of galloping cui et al 2015 li et al 2019 the dsii galloping transition involves a change of slope of the s t y r e profile at r e 197 s t y diverges from s t c l in the galloping regime such that s t y s t c l during galloping motion s t c l increases slowly with r e while s t y continues to fall the magnitude of s t y is one order lower than the one for s t c l a jump discontinuity in y m a x fig 8b at r e 198 reflects the onset of galloping thereafter the response undergoes monotonic rise the onset of lock in and attainment of peak transverse response occur simultaneously at r e 77 coincidence of these events with m 4 as opposed to their divergence with m 3 signifies the essential role of mass ratio however s t y attains its peak at r e 78 therefore even with m 4 onset of lock in does not signify the beginning of lower branch prior to the onset of galloping the flow and body motion are periodic with single frequency the dsii galloping transition is associated with transition from periodic to quasi periodic flow and body motion fig 8c presents a close up of this transition regime the flow oscillations remain quasi periodic up to the maximum reynolds number of 250 considered along the path of decreasing r e the response is quasi periodic in the galloping regime as well as the upper extremity of dsii at r e 197 fig 8i elsewhere in dsii it is periodic primary hysteresis is absent and secondary hysteresis exists only at a discrete point i e the terminal point of dsii corresponding to r e 197 the solutions at r e 197 along the increasing and decreasing paths are periodic fig 8h and quasi periodic fig 8i respectively this is the reason that solutions differ or turn hysteretic at this point time traces of lift fig 8d and cross stream response fig 8f establish the quasi periodic nature of oscillation and flow at r e 198 the respective power spectra are shown in figs 8e and 8g each power spectrum consists of a pair of peaks corresponding to s t y and s t c l respectively the vortex shedding frequency obtained via fft of c l fig 8e corresponds to the dominant peak at s t 0 176 the weaker peak with s t 0 0475 relates to the oscillation frequency the peaks for y are of identical strength fig 8g with s t y 0 049 and s t c l 0 175 the ratio of the larger to smaller frequency is 3 57 an irrational number this further ascertains the quasi periodicity of y the trajectory of cylinder centre suggests that the oscillations are periodic at r e 197 fig 8h and quasi periodic at r e 197 decreasing fig 8i 198 fig 8j 199 fig 8k and 250 fig 8l in summary for m 4 the oscillations are periodic viv at low r e and quasi periodic galloping at high r e in the viv regime an 1 1 synchronization exists between transverse oscillations and vortex shedding however for galloping motion at r e 198 oscillation and vortex shedding frequencies maintain a ratio of 1 3 59 that is different from but quite close to 1 3 several earlier studies bearman et al 1987 zhao et al 2014a sen and mittal 2015 2016 identified an 1 3 sub harmonic synchronization between transverse oscillations and vortex shedding in the galloping branch for representative r e in the viv and galloping regimes table 4 lists the values of oscillation and shedding frequencies along with their ratios 5 2 2 the surface pressure time averaged pressure along the cylinder surface is depicted in fig 9 for r e 200 and 240 respectively corresponding to low and high amplitude galloping oscillations the pressure profiles are quite similar to their viv counterparts fig 5 for m 3 symmetry of each c p curve about the base point eliminates the possibility of asymmetric wake in the galloping regime the pressure differential between points e and f increases as r e is increased from 200 to 240 therefore c d continues to increase in the galloping branch 5 2 3 wake modes of vortex formation an 1 3 sub harmonic synchronization suggests the equivalence of one oscillation cycle to three cycles of vortex shedding therefore three pairs of opposite signed vortices are shed in each oscillation cycle sen and mittal 2016 discussed that under such condition the possible wake vortex arrangements are unstable 2s or 3 2s for quasi periodic galloping and 2p 2s for periodic galloping an additional constraint for formation of 2p 2s mode is that y m a x d must be equal to or greater than 0 7 sen and mittal 2015 for m 4 galloping is quasi periodic and the maximum value of normalized y response is 0 3644 at r e 250 with this background it is obvious that the possible wake mode in the galloping branch is n 2s where n is the nearest integer of s t c l s t y ratio for m 4 n 3 4 and 5 since formation of the wake mode is a function of y m a x williamson and roshko 1988 and m 4 oscillator involves low amplitude galloping the vortices contributing to n 2s mode do not interact among themselves to construct complex modes they instead travel downstream as continuation of 2s vortices the instantaneous vorticity in the galloping regime is shown in fig 10a for r e 198 and 10b for r e 240 respectively even though the wake mode looks very similar to 2s in both cases these are respectively 3 2s and 4 2s since synchronization is close to 1 3 and 1 4 in context with free vibrations of a rigid square cylinder at high r e zhao et al 2014a suggests that the number of vortices contributing to wake mode increases with increase of the ratio of vortex shedding to cylinder oscillation frequency for 1 3 synchronization they resolved the 3 2s wake vortex mode for free vibrations of an isolated square cylinder at r e 200 bhatt and alam 2018 recently resolved the n 2s wake mode with n 9 for undamped transverse only motion of an isolated square cylinder of m 10 li et al 2019 reported the identification of 4 2s mode at r e 150 and u 20 5 3 transition from viv to combined viv and galloping the results presented in sections 5 1 and 5 2 hint that the mass ratio for first occurrence of galloping motion of a square cylinder for r e 250 is bracketed by m 3 and 4 to determine the value of this mass ratio computations have been performed for several intermediate values of m by analysing the lock in and response characteristics for these m it is found that the transition occurs for m 3 4 the fluid forces at m 3 4 however do not exhibit any noticeable amplification relative to the pure viv case of m 3 3 in the galloping regime 5 3 1 determination of transition m from lock in and response characteristics fig 11 depicts the relationship of s t and cross stream response with r e for m 3 3 3 4 and 3 5 the characteristics for m 3 3 figs 11a and 11b are very similar to those of m 3 relative to m 3 3 the lock in and response patterns for m 3 4 figs 11c and 11d and 3 5 figs 11e and 11f exhibit significant departure at higher r e these instead closely follow the traits of m 4 oscillator for the square cylinder executing free undamped vibrations an additional galloping branch appears for the first time when the value of m reaches 3 4 this is the lowest value of mass ratio required for the onset of galloping motion for r e 250 the value of oscillation frequency at the onset of galloping 0 0397 drops to about 25 of the corresponding value at the onset of lock in 0 1611 the lock in in the galloping branch is soft as noted for low m oscillators irrespective of m the minimum value of r e at which inception of galloping occurs in a square cylinder is of the order of 150 the corresponding values of critical reynolds number predicted by barrero gil et al 2009 joly et al 2012 and sen and mittal 2015 are 159 140 and 165 respectively the value of critical reduced speed is 11 514 sen and mittal 2015 2016 according to li et al 2019 galloping occurs at a critical reduced speed exceeding 10 the implication of these critical values towards occurrence of galloping is that for any value of mass ratio and reduced speed the flow reynolds number must exceed 150 and similarly for any value of m and r e the reduced speed must surpass the limit of 11 514 else the motion will be purely viv it therefore appears that the mass ratio assumes importance as a key controlling parameter for transition of viv to galloping when both r e and u simultaneously surpass their respective critical values the further insightful implication of fig 11 is that above the critical r e transition of viv to combined viv and galloping relies on three parameters i e m r e and u the role of mass ratio can be understood considering the case of m 3 transition m where galloping is absent even when r e 150 and u 11 514 figs 2a and 2b the occurrence of galloping therefore is a function of certain combinations of m r e and u in each of which r e 150 and u 11 514 one such combination is for m transition m either r e 150 or u 11 5 but both r e and u must surpass their critical limits joly et al 2012 reported low amplitude galloping of an m 3 3 4 square cylinder at r e 200 150 and u 40 11 5 considering identical value of u of 40 as used by joly et al 2012 and the lowest permissible value of r e 150 li et al 2019 recently determined the transition mass ratio for transition of viv of a square cylinder to galloping they found that transition m 4 however this value of the transition mass ratio is non unique several values of the transition mass ratios can be determined by altering u and keeping r e fixed at 150 eq 8 of sen and mittal 2015 suggests that the transition m varies inversely with r e or u hence the value of the transition mass ratio can be reduced by increasing both r e and u this suggests that the value of the transition mass ratio is a function of the range of reynolds number considered an open question that arises here is that can we continue to increase r e so that galloping occurs with whatever small the mass ratio be alternately does a square cylinder of extremely small mass ratio gallop or whether there exists a limiting mass ratio below which a square cylinder does not gallop irrespective of reynolds number or reduced speed these thoughts are out of scope of the current work and will not be discussed extensive three dimensional computations are required to address the aforesaid queries three events that draw utmost attention in the viv regime are the onset of lock in occurrence of maximum transverse response and occurrence of maximum of oscillation or vortex shedding frequency the relationship among these events depends solely on m as evident from the first second fourth and fifth columns of table 5 depending on the occurrence of these events three regimes of m are identified i 3 m 3 4 the events occur independent of r e onset of lock in and subsequent attainment of peak response take place in the initial branch lower branch initiates after the lock in sets in ii 3 4 m 4 the onset of lock in involves maximum response initial branch however beginning of lower branch is still a post lock in phenomenon iii 5 m 20 the onset of lock in coincides the same r e with occurrence of maximum s t y and the onset marks the beginning of lower branch the data in last three rows in table 5 is reproduced from sen and mittal 2015 as the value of m surpasses 3 4 the reynolds number or u marking the dsii galloping transition continues to fall the r e indicating the onset of lock in on the other hand increases 5 3 2 implications of the transition mass ratio as discussed in section 5 3 1 the transition mass ratio can be lowered below 3 4 by increasing r e and or u sufficiently beyond their critical values this study raises the question that can one lower the m indefinitely and still the cylinder exhibits galloping it may be possible that even after satisfying the den hartog stability criterion a square cylinder of sufficiently low mass ratio may not execute galloping extensive studies are required to conclusively comment on this possibility the mass ratios of the order of 10 correspond to hydroelastic vibrations therefore the order of magnitude of the predicted transition mass ratio is relevant for offshore structures where several risers are packed together within a square shaped envelope joly et al 2012 in designing such structures containing bundles of riser cables the prediction of possibility of galloping and its outcome on the structure is of paramount importance damblans et al 2013 in general offshore structures that are exposed to ocean currents undergo flow induced vibrations these undesirable vibrations reduce the lifetime of such structures and the structures may eventually fail due to fatigue the transition mass ratio predicted by us provides a safety limit for structures below which high amplitude galloping oscillations get suppressed therefore the material as well as dimensions of the oscillator can be selected such that the mass ratio becomes of the order of 3 4 or smaller so as to minimize the possibility of transition of flow induced motion to galloping for transverse galloping barrero gil et al 2010 analysed the mechanism of extracting energy from the surrounding flow the transition mass ratio therefore defines the lower limit of m that can be employed for harvesting the energy from flow 5 3 3 the in line response characteristics sourav and sen 2017 suggested that because of non zero value of mean drag the in line response is always positive and value of the time averaged x is also non zero evident from lissajou diagrams of fig 8h through 8l and fig 15 of the current paper the mean transverse response is however zero valued as opposed to the maximum streamwise response the r m s of in line response x r m s is independent of location of the origin of the coordinate system and hence is a better indicator of streamwise response the in line response assumes importance for low m the dependence of x r m s on r e is illustrated via figs 12a 12b and 12c for m 3 3 3 4 and 3 5 respectively all the branches pertaining to the y response are quite apparent also from the x r m s r e plots it is found that the reynolds number corresponding to the maximum of x r m s and y m a x is identical 75 5 3 4 inherent quasi periodicity of galloping at onset up to the upper boundary of dsii s t y and s t c l converge the frequency domain is therefore characterized by a single dominant frequency galloping is a soft lock in phenomenon where f n s t y and s t c l differ from each other such that s t y is much closer to f n than s t c l figs 8a 11c and 11e the frequency domain therefore consists of both s t y and s t c l this is the reason that the galloping oscillations are inherently quasi periodic at its origin and thereafter as apparent from fig 13a for m 3 4 the body motion is periodic at the terminal point of dsii i e r e 229 time traces of y at r e 230 fig 13b and 240 fig 13c suggest that galloping at its origin involves quasi periodicity and retains this behaviour for the entire range of r e considered for m 3 3 and 3 4 fig 14 shows the power spectra of c l and y at representative r e a single dominant peak in the spectra of c l and y ascertains periodic flow and rigid body motion for m 3 3 at r e 250 figs 14a and 14b figs 14c and 14d establish periodicity one extremely weak and one dominant peak in y spectrum single peak in c l spectrum for m 3 4 at r e 229 marking end of dsii for the same m transition to quasi periodicity at r e 230 is ensured via existence of a pair of peaks corresponding to s t y and s t c l in each fft figs 14e and 14f the quasi periodic nature of galloping is further evidenced from fig 15 which presents for m 3 4 and 3 5 the trajectory of the cylinder centre at representative reynolds numbers in the galloping branch similar to the lissajou diagrams in the viv regime figs 2c and 2d the phase portraits preserve symmetry about y 0 the essence of this observation is the vanishing of mean lift symmetry of mean surface pressure about cylinder base and shedding of equal number of clockwise and counterclockwise vortices in an oscillation cycle absence of asymmetric wake mode for each m table 6 summarizes the spectral behaviour of individual response branches 5 3 5 existence of hysteresis near dsii galloping transition hysteresis or solution multiplicity is a well known feature of fsi sen and mittal 2015 found that the solutions are completely hysteresis free for m 1 i e when the cylinder executes viv alone for m 5 they noted weak primary hysteresis near the onset of lock in and strong secondary hysteresis close to the beginning of galloping for m 3 3 3 4 and 3 5 respectively the first second and third rows of fig 11 ascertain absence of primary hysteresis for m 3 4 a regime of secondary hysteresis exists towards the closure of dsii hysteresis is however not experienced at the inception of galloping or at other r e in the galloping branch interestingly the first occurrence of galloping at m 3 4 is associated with the presence of a wide secondary hysteresis region hinting towards a possible link between them towards the upper extremity of dsii solutions along increasing r e computations are periodic those for decreasing r e are quasi periodic for instance see figs 8h and 8i for m 4 at r e 197 and 197 decreasing respectively since the initial condition comes from the quasi periodic galloping branch at a given r e the magnitude of y displacement with quasi periodic motion exceeds the one with periodic motion this mismatch in y m a x value leads to the formation of the hysteresis loop 5 3 6 effect of damping on the transition to investigate the effects of structural damping on the transition of viv only motion to combined viv and galloping computations were performed for mass ratios 3 3 and 3 5 bounding the transition mass ratio of 3 4 for these computations ζ was assigned a value of 0 044 while the other parameters were kept identical to those considered for undamped motion the frequency and y response characteristics figs 16a and 16b respectively for m 3 3 and 3 5 both reveal that the oscillator motion is purely viv and devoid of galloping a damped viv therefore transits to galloping at higher mass ratio or alternately introduction of damping delays the transition of viv only motion to combined viv and galloping for a flexible square cylinder subject to wind flow abdel rohman 1994 analytically found that introduction of moderate structural damping results in occurrence of galloping at higher values of incoming wind speed i e the onset of galloping gets delayed for m 3 5 the oscillation frequency under damped and undamped conditions is compared in fig 16c the absence of low frequency segment with damped vibrations indicates that the motion is viv only for the same mass ratio fig 16d compares the transverse response of undamped and damped motion the decaying response in lower branch and absence of galloping with ζ 0 044 ascertains the stabilizing nature of structural damping 5 3 7 effect of galloping on fluid loading for m 3 4 as apparent from the discussions above the occurrence of galloping for m 3 4 is associated with appreciable rise in y m a x x r m s and fall in s t y the change of trend of response and oscillation frequency with r e is however not reflected by c d and c l r m s shown in figs 17a and 17b respectively the c d and c l r m s curves for m 3 3 3 4 and 3 5 are virtually identical rendering the determination of transition m from fluid forces practically impossible the essence of identical fluid loading is that cylinder surface pressure for an arbitrary r e in the galloping branch must be very similar for m 3 3 3 4 and 3 5 in other words galloping at its inception is unable to modify the surface pressure corresponding to dsii regime this is evident from fig 17c 17d and 17e depicting the mean pressure and close up of c p 0 and c p b respectively as the value of m is increased to 4 the galloping branch becomes highly discernible from the dsii regime as slope change of both c d and c l r m s at the onset of galloping is very prominent 5 3 8 wake vortex modes the instantaneous vorticity field at r e 240 is shown in fig 18a 18b and 18c for m 3 3 3 4 and 3 5 respectively for m 3 3 the cylinder executes viv alone thus synchronization between transverse oscillations and vortex shedding is 1 1 hence the wake mode is 2s for m 3 4 and 3 5 the 1 1 ratio deems invalid in the galloping branch and the wake mode deviates from the basic 2s the mode in such cases belongs to the n 2s set discussed in section 5 2 3 5 3 9 phase between c l and y the oscillation and vortex shedding frequencies differ for the galloping cylinder and in a strict sense phase angle ϕ between c l and y cannot be defined in such cases a phase angle can still be represented by the time lag between the signals the lag or time delay between c l and y is computed from the time distribution of cross correlation function r between the signals the time lag corresponding to the maximum value of r is a measure of ϕ the ratio of time lag and time period of dominant oscillation frequency provides the value of ϕ in radian for the m 3 4 cylinder fig 19a plots the time traces of c l and y at r e 250 time series of the cross correlation between c l and y is shown in fig 19b the highlighted portion of fig 19b is shown with exaggeration in fig 19c from here we obtain the value of normalized time lag corresponding to the maximum r as 2 49 the time period of oscillations computed from fft of y signal equals 26 73 therefore the phase angle between lift and transverse displacement at r e 250 is 2 49 26 73 36 0 33 54 the phase angle as a function of r e is plotted in fig 19d for a pair of m corresponding to viv only motion m 3 3 and both viv and galloping m 3 4 also superimposed is the variation of cross stream response for each mass ratio the lift and transverse displacement are in phase up to r e 95 a phase shift by about 180 occurs at r e 96 where the vortex shedding becomes extremely weak and lock in terminates for m 3 3 the out of phase relationship prevails over the rest of the r e considered in contrast for m 3 4 ϕ drops further at r e 230 corresponding to the onset of galloping the value of ϕ in the galloping branch lies in the range of 33 42 the ϕ r e profiles therefore signify that c l and y are in phase in dsi initial branch and lower branch they are out of phase in dsii in the galloping branch the values of ϕ tend towards in phase for in phase condition c l aids y and for out of phase c l obstructs y in dsi and initial branch rise of y with r e is consistent with increasing strength of vortex shedding in the lower branch y m a x drops with r e even though c l and y are in phase this results from weakening of vortex shedding and consequent decay of c l r m s with increasing r e monotonic rise of s t c l and c l r m s in the galloping regime indicates that shedding is again significant because of low magnitude of ϕ an effective component of c l exists to aid y the magnitude of y therefore depends on the magnitude of c l r m s or strength of vortex shedding as well as ϕ for both m c l y phase portraits at selected r e are shown in fig 19e through 19g the ratio of the intercept of the c l y plot with y 0 line and projection of the portrait on the y 0 line provides an estimate of the phase angle between c l and y the out of phase relationship between periodic c l and y and 1 1 synchronization between them one closed loop with no cross over point for m 3 3 at r e 250 are obvious from fig 19e for m 3 4 phase portraits at r e 230 fig 19f and 250 fig 19g indicate that c l and y are quasi periodic and not out of phase 5 4 discussion on possible transition to three dimensionality for r e 200 for stationary square circular cylinders the three dimensional wake transition involves the mode a and b instabilities for a stationary square cylinder at zero incidence sohankar et al 1999 conducted direct numerical simulations using a blockage of 5 6 and concluded that the flow turns three dimensional at some r e between 150 and 200 sheard et al 2009 numerically captured the inception of three dimensional instability mode a at r e 164 yoon et al 2012 suggests that the wake transition occurs when r e exceeds 165 the corresponding values presented by choi et al 2012 park and yang 2016 and jiang and cheng 2018 are 166 5 166 6 and 165 7 respectively however under the conditions of free or forced vibrations of a cylinder the reynolds number marking the three dimensional wake transition increases and flow remains two dimensional even beyond the critical r e corresponding to a fixed cylinder some studies reporting this delaying effect due to vibrations are presented below based on direct measurements toebes 1969 argued that strong oscillations guard the region of separation against three dimensional wake distortions in other words oscillations strengthen the correlation of vortex shedding along the length of the oscillator novak and tanaka 1975 also reported enhancement of spanwise coherence of flow and fluid loading due to vibrations in context of viv of a long circular cylinder at r e 500 blackburn and henderson 1999 also reported that oscillations suppress three dimensionality thus render the near wake to be two dimensional for viv of a rigid circular cylinder at r e 300 evangelinos and karniadakis 1999 numerically demonstrated that the near wake x d 10 exhibits two dimensional behaviour for forced transverse vibrations of a circular cylinder leontini et al 2007 found that the transition reynolds number increases to 280 from its stationary counterpart of about 190 zhao et al 2014b conducted extensive numerical investigations for transverse viv of a circular cylinder of m 2 over r e 150 1000 the reduced speed was varied from 2 to 12 both two and three dimensional computations were performed for the vibrating circular cylinder zhao et al 2014b found that the value of critical reynolds number marking the transition to three dimensionality turns higher as compared to the one obtained from its stationary counterpart the flow around the vibrating cylinder was found to remain completely two dimensional at least up to r e 250 zhao et al 2014b also observed the insensitivity of vortex shedding and lift force to the spanwise direction based on immersed boundary computations for transversely only motion of a circular cylinder of m 2 4 and 100 du et al 2014 concluded that vibrations increase the critical reynolds number for transition to three dimensionality they noted that the wake of a vibrating circular cylinder at r e 300 is very similar to that of a two dimensional wake and transition to three dimensionality occurs when r e is increased from 350 to 425 in view of these the two dimensional computations for r e 200 are expected to adequately predict the features of flow and body motion 6 conclusions the study by sen and mittal 2015 concerning free undamped vibrations of a rigid square cylinder along and across the flow demonstrates that the cylinder executes viv for m 1 while for m 5 its motion is viv at low r e and galloping at high r e the existence of a mass ratio bounded by the 1 5 interval and marking the transition from viv only motion to viv followed by galloping is therefore quite obvious by direct computations based on a stabilized space time finite element formulation the value of this transition m obtained in the present work is 3 4 for m 3 4 the oscillations are purely viv and solutions unique or non hysteretic a square shaped oscillator satisfies the den hartog stability criterion and hence is prone to galloping the most essential conclusion of the current work is that it also takes into consideration the effects of mass ratio reynolds number reduced speed and structural damping in influencing the transition from viv to viv and galloping this study indicates that the den hartog criterion is solely insufficient to determine whether a non axisymmetric oscillator such as a square will gallop irrespective of the values of m r e u and ζ it is found that introduction of damping delays the transition or increases the transition mass ratio this study raises a quest that a square oscillator of sufficiently low m may not gallop even after satisfying the den hartog criterion however further extensive studies may deterministically reach to such a conclusion non unique solutions at a given r e are characteristic to hysteresis in the context of free vibrations of a square cylinder two discrete sets of solutions are obtained close to the transition from dsii to galloping dsii solutions along the forward computations are essentially periodic galloping being a soft lock in phenomenon is inherently quasi periodic at its inception for 3 4 m 4 the entire galloping branch is quasi periodic the initial condition for backward computations must come from the galloping branch and hence is quasi periodic backward solutions at certain r e in the dsii are therefore quasi periodic the quasi periodic nature of galloping at its onset therefore ensures that the dsii galloping transition must be hysteretic based on the correlation among occurrence of maximum s t maximum y and onset of lock in three distinct regimes of m bounded by its values of 3 and 20 are identified for 3 m 3 4 these events are uncorrelated i e they occur at different r e the onset of lock in and occurrence of maximum y are coincident at same r e or u for 3 4 m 4 all three events are in complete correlation for 5 m 20 irrespective of m mean surface pressure at each r e is symmetric about the base point this ensures the disappearance of mean lift i e mean c l 0 consequently mean y 0 as expected irrespective of the resonance branch the x y and c d c l phase portraits exhibit symmetry about the mean of y or c l in context of free undamped vibrations of a square cylinder absence of any unbalanced lift force in each shedding cycle therefore eliminates the possibility of any asymmetric wake vortex mode to form for viv the wake vortex mode is 2s or c 2s however in galloping branch time period of an oscillation cycle is quite larger than vortex shedding cycle in such cases the wake mode is denoted by the symbol n 2s where n is the nearest integer of the s t c l s t y ratio because of low amplitude galloping the vortices shed in an oscillation cycle do not reorganize to form a complex mode the phase between lift force as input and transverse response as output is computed from the lag in cross correlation function between them the quantities are in phase in dsi initial branch and most of lower branch out of phase relationship prevails over the whole of dsii in the galloping branch ϕ lies between 33 and 42 so that there always exists a component of c l causing amplification of response the magnitude of response is a function of both strength of vortex shedding lift and phase relationship between c l and y in general vortex shedding continues to get stronger reflected by fluctuations in c p at cylinder shoulders or s t c l c l r m s variation with r e till lock in sets in in this zone y increases monotonically as expected in ϕ 0 regime subsequently shedding gets attenuated moving away from synchronization with r e and becomes extremely weak at the upper boundary of lock in at r e 96 where both s t y and c l r m s are minimum even though ϕ 0 here y keeps on decaying as c l also drops though vortex shedding is stronger in dsii the out of phase relation precludes y from attaining large values three dimensional computations will be performed in future to study the variation of transition m at high r e 
22635,a rigid oscillator of square cross section at zero incidence is susceptible to galloping motion depending on the mass ratio m of the oscillator the oscillations may be vortex induced viv or alternately vortex induced at low reynolds numbers r e and galloping at higher r e for r e 250 the mass ratio at which the motion turns from viv only to the one with combined viv and galloping is determined via space time finite element computations in two dimensions for 3 m 4 this choice of m range is driven by the conclusion drawn by sen and mittal 2015 that the value of transition mass ratio lies between 1 and 5 for free undamped vibrations of a square cylinder simultaneously along and across the flow the transition occurs when the value of m equals 3 4 there exists an essential interdependence between the onset of galloping and presence of secondary hysteresis at m 3 4 keywords square cylinder space time finite element vortex induced vibrations galloping transition mass ratio periodic and quasi periodic 1 introduction the free or vortex induced vibrations viv of a flexibly mounted rigid obstacle immersed in a moving viscous fluid is the most common type of fluid structure interaction fsi bluff oscillators of any shape undergo viv provided they possess sufficient afterbody or extent of material body beyond the separation points bearman et al 1987 corless and parkinson 1988 galloping motion on the other hand is a self excited fsi executed by oscillators of non axisymmetric cross section cui et al 2015 the basic non circular cylinders that execute low frequency strouhal number s t 1 corless and parkinson 1988 and high amplitude galloping motion are triangular alonso et al 2012 rectangular robertson et al 2003 cui et al 2015 square amandolese and hemon 2010 sen and mittal 2011 2015 2016 he et al 2012 cui et al 2015 etc such cylinders execute viv as well bearman et al 1987 the amplitude of viv is self limiting in nature limiting normalized amplitude is of the order of unity whereas in galloping instability the response builds up with rising incident flow speed the oscillation amplitude of a circular cylinder executing viv is of the order of its diameter whereas for an ice coated circular transmission cable the galloping response reaches even 100 times the diameter corless and parkinson 1988 for fsi in an incompressible fluid medium blevins 1990 listed seven key non dimensional parameters that depict the vibrations these are body geometry reduced speed normalized amplitude mass ratio reynolds number damping factor and turbulent intensity in the context of vortex induced motion of a given oscillator in the two dimensional laminar flow regime the controlling parameters are 1 reduced speed u the reference free stream speed u normalized by the oscillator natural frequency f n and characteristic dimension d of the oscillator it is expressed as u u f n d the reciprocal of reduced speed is known as reduced natural frequency f n 2 mass ratio m the ratio of the mass of the oscillator m per unit length to the mass of the displaced fluid m is proportional to the m ρ d 2 ratio where ρ is the density of the fluid 3 reynolds number r e it equals the product u d ν where ν is the kinematic viscosity of the fluid 4 damping factor ζ expressed as c 2 k m here c and k respectively denote the damping and stiffness of the oscillator system the present numerical investigation relates to the transition of viv to combined viv and galloping of a square section oscillator in the subsequent paragraphs an account is provided on the earlier studies concerning viv and galloping of a square cylinder the objectives of the current investigation follows thereafter parkinson and smith 1964 proposed a quasi steady theory to model aerodynamic loading on a structure undergoing one degree of freedom galloping for various values of u they presented results for response of a symmetric square cylinder executing galloping in wind bearman et al 1987 conducted experiments for flow induced vibrations of a square cylinder in a wind tunnel for the first time they reported the existence of a kink in the response curve of a square cylinder near u 6 π they also observed an 1 3 sub harmonic synchronization in the kink region corless and parkinson 1988 proposed a semi empirical model to predict the interactions between viv and galloping to this end they combined the hartlen curie model of viv with parkinson and smith s 1964 quasi steady model of galloping by employing a stabilized finite element formulation su et al 2007 perhaps for the first time investigated the free transverse vibrations of a square cylinder of m 10 for undamped motion they presented results for response and fluid forcing at r e 100 for m 905 and 5 u 20 amandolese and hemon 2010 performed aeroelastic experiments on transverse only vibrations of a rigid square cylinder of low structural damping the range of reynolds number was 2000 8000 sen and mittal 2011 numerically investigated over r e 60 250 free undamped vibrations simultaneous in line and cross stream of a rigid square cylinder of m 10 they noted that the motion of cylinder is viv at low r e followed by galloping at high r e he et al 2012 numerically studied the transverse only motion of a square cylinder at r e 250 using m 20 ζ 0 0037 f n 0 025 and u 6 20 40 and 80 for simultaneous in line and transverse free undamped translations of a square cylinder of m 10 they resolved the galloping motion but could not capture the c 2s and 2p 2s wake modes identified by sen and mittal 2011 2015 by considering two additional mass ratios of 5 and 20 he et al 2012 briefly explored the effects of mass ratio on two degrees of freedom viv galloping characteristics based on forced vibration experiments on a circular cylinder williamson and roshko 1988 introduced the nomenclature for various wake vortex modes following the interactions among vortices shed in an oscillation cycle by s williamson and roshko 1988 denoted a single vortex while the symbol p was used to signify a pair of vortices of opposite signs accordingly the basic karman mode of vortex shedding was designated by the symbol 2s thus 2s signifies the basic mode in which a pair of opposite signed vortices are shed in an oscillation cycle the coalescence of 2s vortices in the near wake gives rise to the c 2s mode where c stands for coalescence in 2p 2s mode a pair of opposite signed vortices along with a single vortex shed from either side of the oscillator in a half oscillation cycle therefore a total of six vortices three of them clockwise and rest three counter clockwise constitute the 2p 2s mode by incorporating a quasi steady model joly et al 2012 studied the low r e transverse galloping of a square cylinder for m 1 2 3 4 5 10 15 and 20 they concluded that the critical reynolds number for the onset of galloping in a square cylinder is 140 a value noticeably different than those predicted by barrero gil et al 2009 and sen and mittal 2015 transverse only vibrations of a square cylinder of low mass ratio m 2 2 were experimentally studied by nemes et al 2012 the values of input parameters employed were ζ 2 95 1 0 3 r e 2500 12500 and the angle of incidence was varied from 0 to 45 they noted that motion of the cylinder was viv for 45 incidence and it was galloping for 0 incidence this observation is in agreement with the findings of later experimental investigation by zhao et al 2014a over a narrow regime of intermediate angles of incidence nemes et al 2012 identified a new response branch where the magnitude of response exceeded those obtained from viv or galloping for symmetric 0 and 45 as well as asymmetric 20 angles of incidence zhao et al 2014a conducted high r e experiments concerning flow induced vibrations a low mass ratio of 2 64 was used in consistency with the results of nemes et al 2012 zhao et al 2014a found that the angle of incidence is a key parameter that governs the type of motion to be induced in the oscillator cui et al 2015 employed finite element treatment of two dimensional reynolds averaged navier stokes equations and the k ω turbulence equations to study the flow induced transverse vibrations of a square cylinder for angles of incidence 0 22 5 and 45 and a rectangular cylinder for angles of incidence 0 45 and 90 of aspect ratio 0 5 for each cross section the mass ratio was fixed to 2 4 the motion of the square cylinder with zero incidence was found to be overwhelmingly galloping and for other angles viv was predominant for the rectangular cylinder galloping was prominent for 0 and 90 and viv for 45 incidence the literature presented above essentially suggests that bulk of the research focussed on a single mass ratio of the square cylinder the brief results relating to effects of m on flow and motion of a square cylinder reported by he et al 2012 do not also lead to the concept of the existence of a transition m since they did not consider a sufficiently low m the den hartog stability criterion requires that c y α 0 joly et al 2012 for occurrence of galloping the lateral force c y is computed for a stationary square cylinder oriented at different angles of incidence α close to 0 hence this condition is independent of the mass of the cylinder owing to this the den hartog criterion that is satisfied by the square section does not take into account the role of m hence it is not clear that this is an absolute condition for occurrence of galloping it appears that the oscillator mass ratio is a key parameter that in addition to the den hartog criterion also governs the possibility of galloping it is highly likely that even after satisfying the c y α 0 condition a square cylinder of sufficiently low m may not gallop as discussed above depending on the angle of incidence the motion of a square with sharp corners may be viv galloping or other than viv galloping nemes et al 2012 zhao et al 2014a cui et al 2015 the implication is that the existence of galloping of a square cylinder is a function of its mass ratio angle of incidence and reynolds number or reduced speed it is discussed later in section 5 3 6 that material damping also influences the transition to galloping the role of m on the two degrees of freedom motion of a rigid square cylinder was investigated in details by sen and mittal 2015 via finite element computations for r e 50 250 they studied the free undamped motion of m 1 5 10 and 20 cylinders at zero incidence the cylinder with m 1 executes pure viv while the motion for m 5 is initially viv and galloping thereafter a natural conclusion they therefore had is that the transition from viv only motion to combined viv and galloping occurs at an m that lies between 1 and 5 they also predicted that a square cylinder of arbitrary m cannot gallop below r e 165 687 and u 11 514 the corresponding value of r e predicted by barrero gil et al 2009 was 159 zhao et al 2013 performed finite element simulations of the flow and rigid body equations at r e 100 to explore the vortex induced vibrations of an m 3 square cylinder the reduced speed was varied from 1 to 30 and angles of incidence considered were 0 22 5 and 45 galloping was not seen for any orientation of the oscillator the absence of galloping for zero incidence even well beyond u 11 514 is consistent with quite lower value of r e 165 687 used by zhao et al 2013 a substance of interest therefore evolves around the existence of a certain m below which galloping instability for zero incidence configuration gets suppressed this forms the background for the current numerical investigation the primary objective of this current study is to determine the value of the mass ratio below which galloping motion is not induced in a square cylinder at zero incidence for r e 250 to meet this objective undamped two degrees of freedom motions of a square cylinder is computed for r e 60 250 and a blockage b of 5 blockage is a non dimensional quantity defined as the ratio of width of the body across the flow to the width of the computational domain the relationship f n 14 39 r e or r e 14 39 u coupling the reduced speed and reynolds number is also used the remaining of the document is set in the following manner the governing equations for incompressible fluid flow and motion of rigid body are discussed in section 2 section 3 contains a brief description of the space time finite element formulation the problem statement adequacy of mesh and size of time step are detailed in section 4 this section also provides a detailed discussion of validation of the predicted results the main results are presented in section 5 finally in section 6 few concluding remarks are made 2 the governing equations 2 1 the incompressible flow equations let ω t r 2 and 0 t respectively denote the spatial and temporal domains while γ t i e the boundary of ω t is piecewise smooth the spatial and temporal coordinates are denoted by x x y and t respectively in strong form the coordinate free navier stokes equations of motion governing incompressible flow are 1 ρ u t u u σ 0 on ω t 0 t 2 u 0 on ω t 0 t here u u v and σ are the velocity and stress tensor respectively the constitutive relation for stress tensor in terms of its isotropic or inviscid component p i and deviatoric or viscous component t is 3 σ p i t t 2 μ ε u ε u 1 2 u u t where p i μ and ε are the pressure identity tensor dynamic viscosity of the fluid and strain rate tensor respectively both the essential dirichlet and natural neumann type boundary conditions are considered the initial condition on the velocity field is 4 u x 0 u 0 on ω 0 where u 0 is divergence free i e u 0 satisfies eq 2 signifying conservation of mass 2 2 equations of motion for an elastically mounted rigid square cylinder the two degrees of freedom translations of an oscillator are governed by newton s second law of motion along the in line and cross stream directions expressed as 5 m x y c x y k x y f x t f y t for 0 t here x t and y t stand for dimensional streamwise and transverse displacements of the oscillator respectively these displacements are measured relative to the origin of the fixed coordinate system see fig 1a in eq 5 differentiation with respect to t is represented by a dot in the above dimensional odes the terms in the left hand side stand for inertia force viscous damping and restoring force respectively the instantaneous forcing terms f x t and f y t on the right hand side act at the fluid solid interface and couple the flow and rigid body equations these instantaneous forces are computed by summing up the elemental traction forces at the fluid solid interface the square section oscillator is flexibly mounted and fully immersed in a moving viscous fluid fig 1a normalization of the spatial scale is performed by the characteristic dimension d here d is the edge length of the square cylinder the temporal scale is normalized by u and d the instantaneous drag coefficient c d t f x t 0 5 ρ u 2 d and instantaneous lift coefficient c l t f y t 0 5 ρ u 2 d in the absence of viscous damping the normalized equations of rigid body translation along and across the flow obtained from eq 5 are 6 x 2 π f n 2 x c d 2 m for 0 t 7 y 2 π f n 2 y c l 2 m for 0 t the initial conditions for the above odes are 8 x 0 0 y 0 0 x 0 0 and y 0 0 or the cylinder is initially at rest at the 0 0 location for each m the above initial conditions are employed at the lowest r e considered i e r e 60 and as r e is changed solutions available at the nearest r e are used as initial conditions the details of normalization of eqs 6 and 7 have been presented in kumar et al 2018a the numerical experiments are performed by setting the value of natural frequency of the oscillator equal to the corresponding stationary vortex shedding frequency 0 1439 of the square cylinder at r e 100 from here one obtains the inverse relationships between f n and r e as f n 14 39 r e 3 the finite element formulation a stabilized space time finite element formulation accommodating equal order interpolation for velocity and pressure is used in the present study the interpolation functions are bilinear in space and linear in time globally these interpolation functions are continuous in space but discontinuous in time details of the space time finite element formulation can be found in tezduyar et al 1992a b the stabilization parameters are defined in tezduyar et al 1992c apart from the equations of fluid flow the equations of motion for the oscillator given by eqs 6 and 7 are also cast in the space time formulation details of this are available in tezduyar et al 1992b and mittal 1992 4 problem description convergence tests and validation 4 1 problem statement fig 1a depicts the problem set up for free undamped translations of a rigid square cylinder at zero incidence simultaneously along and across the flow a fluid domain of rectangular shape and size 54 d 20 d is truncated in which the cylinder resides at the onset of cylinder motion location of its centre coincides with the origin of the cartesian coordinate system the x y coordinate system is stationary i e not fixed to the body or the frame of reference is inertial this implies that x x t and y y t the width of the computational domain 20 d corresponds to a blockage of 5 relative to the origin of the coordinate system the upstream and downstream boundaries are located at distances of 24 d and 30 d respectively the boundary conditions employed are free stream inlet slip lateral boundaries stress free exit and no slip fluid solid interface the no slip condition on velocity at the cylinder surface is time dependent and this condition along with fluid forcing couple the flow and rigid body equations a multi block structured mesh consisting of five mesh blocks each of which is composed of bilinear quadrilateral elements is used for domain discretization irrespective of the value of mass ratio the mesh contains 24149 nodes and 23780 bilinear quadrilateral elements while the number of nodes on cylinder surface n t equals 240 the mesh is adaptive in nature it needs reconstruction at each time step such that the outer domain boundary and coordinate system remain fixed with respect to time fig 1b shows the undeformed mesh 4 2 tests for mesh convergence and time step size the computations in the present study have been performed by using the same numerical tool as used by sen 2010 and sen and mittal 2011 for undamped two degrees of freedom motions of a rigid square oscillator of mass ratio 10 sen and mittal 2011 discussed the mesh convergence at r e 90 corresponding to moderate amplitude oscillations in the lower branch of response to establish mesh independence of the computed results they reported results on two meshes m1 and m2 the mesh m1 contains 24149 nodes 23780 bilinear quadrilateral elements and 240 nodes on the cylinder surface for mesh m2 with roughly double the resolution of m1 respective values of these variables are 46256 nodes 45744 bilinear quadrilateral elements and 296 surface nodes table 1 of sen and mittal 2011 demonstrated the sufficiency of mesh m1 for free vibration computations of the square oscillator the present computations have been performed entirely on mesh m1 for m 10 and identical problem set up as considered in this study sen 2010 tested the effect of time step size t on undamped viv characteristics of a rigid square cylinder at r e 90 the discussion and table presented here on adequacy of time step size have been reproduced from sen 2010 for computations on mesh m1 two values of time step size were considered i e t u d 0 03 and 0 015 table 1 below summarizes the results for test of adequacy of time step size as apparent from this table the characteristic flow viv quantities display insensitivity to normalized time step size smaller than 0 03 a maximum deviation of about 3 57 is found for x r m s thus sufficiency of t u d 0 03 for the present set of computations is established based on the mesh and time sensitivity tests all the computations in this work have been performed on mesh m1 using a normalized time step size of 0 03 4 3 validation of results to the best of the knowledge of the authors no experimental result is currently available for viv of a square cylinder over the range of r e considered in the present work owing to this the validation is performed relative to the computational results available in the literature the results presented by sen and mittal 2011 in context of undamped two degrees of freedom free vibrations of a rigid square cylinder of m 10 were used by he et al 2012 for validation of their proposed combined interface boundary condition cibc method tables 12 and 13 of he et al 2012 display the comparison and a close agreement of parameters such as response forces and frequency from the two sets of computations is quite obvious in this work we have conducted at r e 100 and u 5 validation test of the computed results with other results available zhao et al 2013 jaiman et al 2016 both of these studies consider two degrees of freedom viv at r e 100 in the literature for a freely vibrating rigid square cylinder at zero and 45 angles of incidence in each case m 3 and ζ 0 zhao et al 2013 explored the viv of a square cylinder at zero and 45 incidences while jaiman et al 2016 considered the case of zero incidence for u 5 table 2 compares the predicted y m a x d with those reported by zhao et al 2013 and jaiman et al 2016 the closeness of the comparison establishes the accuracy of the predicted results the studies by sen and mittal 2011 he et al 2012 zhao et al 2013 jaiman et al 2016 as well as the present study are all based on finite element computations the present study employs implicit time stepping and hence the size of time step is not restricted by the cfl condition for each of the studies discussed above table 3 lists the values of time step size total number of nodes and of elements in the mesh for the current computations convergence for mesh resolution and time step size have been discussed in section 4 2 5 results using a blockage of 5 results concerning undamped free vibrations of a square cylinder for 3 m 4 are presented using two dimensional computations over 60 r e 250 the element level matrix and vector entries are computed by employing the 2 2 2 points gauss legendre quadrature rule within each time step the discretized flow equations are solved by using the gmres iterative solver developed by saad and schultz 1986 for asymmetric matrix equation systems while the second order odes for oscillator motion are solved via numerical integration see mittal and tezduyar 1994 two sets of computations are performed for each m these correspond to calculations along increasing and decreasing r e for which solutions from lower and higher r e respectively are used as initial guess this is done to examine the existence of hysteresis or solution multiplicity in flow and characteristics of rigid body motion irrespective of m the lowest value of r e for occurrence of galloping is of the order of 150 while the minimum reduced speed is 11 514 discussed in details later in section 5 3 1 we therefore choose the upper limit of r e such that it exceeds 150 and similarly the maximum value of u exceeds 11 514 following the observation of sen and mittal 2015 that the motion of the cylinder with unit mass ratio is purely viv and it is a combination of viv and galloping for m 5 we first explore the motion of the m 3 cylinder the response for m 3 fig 2b of this paper turns out to be very similar to that of m 1 see figure 3a of sen and mittal 2015 this confirms that the mass ratio marking the transition from viv only motion to combined viv and galloping for 150 r e 250 and 11 514 u 250 14 39 17 37 lies between 3 and 5 5 1 overview of viv and flow characteristics for m 3 5 1 1 synchronization and response for m 3 fig 2a illustrates the reynolds number or reduced speed dependence of cylinder oscillation frequency s t y and vortex shedding frequency s t c l over the entire range of r e the frequencies converge 1 1 synchronization between transverse oscillations and vortex shedding ensuring that motion of the oscillator is periodic with single dominant frequency the phenomenon of lock in or synchronization implies oneness of the cylinder oscillation frequency vortex shedding frequency and natural frequency of the cylinder williamson and govardhan 2004 for an oscillator of high mass ratio lock in suggests that the frequency ratio or ratio of the cylinder oscillation frequency to its natural frequency closely approaches the value of unity for m 3 cylinder the response consists of the initial branch lower branch and desynchronization or decoherence regime by analysing the viv response of an elliptic cylinder navrose et al 2014 further decomposed the region of desynchronization or out of resonance or lock in into its dsi and dsii components according to navrose et al 2014 an oscillator undergoes low amplitude normalized response 0 03 oscillations in the first regime of desynchronization or dsi this regime occurs prior to the onset of lock in the second regime of desynchronization or dsii exists close to the upper extremity of resonance or lock in this is also a low amplitude region amplitude exceeds that of dsi whose extent appreciably surpasses that of dsi kumar et al 2018a recently proposed a method for identification of response branches and associated transitions from one branch to another this method relies on change of slope of the frequency curve for m 3 the first change of slope of s t y occurs at r e 72 this slope change marks the transition from the first regime of desynchronization dsi to initial branch a jump discontinuity to s t y 0 1564 at r e 73 from s t y 0 1433 at r e 72 signifies the onset of lock in unlike the cases of higher m i e 5 the jump however does not mark the beginning of lower branch since the slope of s t y r e profile remains the same till r e 74 therefore the initial branch extends from r e 72 to 74 the second transition or transition from initial to lower branch follows the subsequent slope change of s t y and is found to take place at r e 75 at this juncture s t y attains its peak value of 0 1614 during lock in s t y initially rises in initial branch and then drops in lower branch the third final slope change or transition from lower branch to the second regime of desynchronization dsii occurs at r e 96 where both s t y and s t c l become minimum 0 1508 post lock in this is the closure of lock in s t continues to rise with r e in dsii as noted for a fixed cylinder overall s t ranges roughly between 0 12 and 0 19 for galloping of m 5 10 and 20 square cylinders over r e 50 250 sen and mittal 2015 found that the value of s t y is one order of magnitude lower i e it hovers around 0 06 the later study by sen and mittal 2016 suggests that galloping at its inception involves quasi periodicity the order of magnitude of s t y and absence of quasi periodicity underscore that motion of the m 3 cylinder is pure viv the variation of maximum transverse response y m a x d is depicted in fig 2b the maximum response of 0 3029 d is attained at r e 74 post lock in considering forward r e as well as backward r e solutions sen and mittal 2015 earlier demonstrated that irrespective of m the maximum transverse response of a square cylinder is practically constant to 0 3 d for the present case of pure viv with m 3 it is noted that occurrence of maximum y m a x d does not coincide with the onset of lock in or beginning of lower branch the x y lissajou diagrams signifying trajectory of the cylinder centre are double looped as shown at representative reynolds numbers of 80 fig 2c and 250 fig 2d for both cases the pair of loops implies that frequency of in line motion is twice the frequency of cross stream motion as discussed above lock out or closure of lock in occurs at r e 96 marking the termination of the lower branch and the dsii regime initiates at r e 96 for m 1 sen and mittal 2015 incorrectly labelled the corresponding response regime as lower branch fig 3a of their paper 5 1 2 the surface pressure c p the lower branch of resonance extends from r e 75 to 96 therefore vortex shedding is very strong and very weak near its lower and upper bounds respectively to examine the modifications of c p due to vortex shedding a set of two borderline reynolds numbers 75 and 95 is considered fig 3 illustrates for r e 75 the time series of surface pressure at the stagnation points and shoulders interestingly c p at stagnation points i e c p 0 and c p b displays time periodicity with single frequency and at the shoulders c p t and c p d it reveals time periodicity with multiple frequencies this behaviour is evident from the power spectra presented via fig 3c through 3f c p at the shoulders oscillate with cylinder oscillation frequency or frequency of lift of magnitude 0 1614 on the contrary at the stagnation points it oscillates with twice the cylinder oscillation frequency or frequency of drag c p is positive pressure directed towards the surface at the forward stagnation point and negative pressure is directed away from the surface at the other three points analysis of the time traces at the stagnation points reveals that c p 0 and c p b are almost in phase fig 3a the difference between mean values of c p 0 1 0789 and c p b 1 0055 is a measure of pressure recovery at cylinder base higher the difference lower the pressure recovery higher the drag and vice versa fig 3b indicates that surface pressure at the top and bottom shoulders is identical while being out of phase the out of phase relationship is consistent with the alternate shedding of opposite signed vortices from the upper and lower rear surfaces of the cylinder identical magnitude of mean c p at the shoulders tallies well with the zero mean value of transverse lift force maximum fluctuations in c p is associated in the direction of lift and minimum fluctuation is recorded by c p 0 therefore the r m s of lift is expected to surpass the magnitude of r m s of drag see section 5 1 3 since vortex shedding modifies the surface pressure distribution amplitudes of c p at two sets of diametrically opposite points underscore that modification of c p due to vortex shedding is dominant across the flow fig 4 illustrates the characteristics of surface pressure for r e 95 from here it is obvious that weak vortex shedding is unable to excite large fluctuations in the pressure signals figs 4a and 4b therefore the magnitudes of c d r m s and c l r m s fall drastically figs 6b and 6c compared to those at r e 75 comparison of figs 3a and 4a reveals that the effects of vibrations are more on c p b than on c p 0 stronger the vibrations lesser the c p b the mean values of c p 0 and c p b at r e 95 are 1 0438 and 0 7420 respectively the pressure recovery with high amplitude oscillations at r e 75 is therefore much lesser than pressure recovery with low amplitude oscillations at r e 95 this predicts a higher value of mean drag at r e 75 than at r e 95 fig 5a plots at r e 75 and fig 5b at r e 95 the distribution of time averaged c p along the oscillator surface in either case c p is maximum at the forward stagnation point e and minimum near the front corners a and b it is constant along the rear surface cd c p displays symmetry about the base point f a symmetry of mean surface pressure about the base point is indicative of anti symmetric vortex shedding in such cases an asymmetric wake vortex mode does not generate therefore at r e 75 and 95 the wake mode must be anti symmetric in section 5 1 4 it is shown that the mode is basic karman or 2s which is anti symmetric it is evident from fig 5 that the differential pressure between points e and f is higher for r e 75 than for r e 95 this further ascertains the higher recovery of pressure at base near the end of lock in 5 1 3 fluid forces the mean drag of the freely vibrating cylinder is shown in fig 6a along with its stationary counterpart except for dsi drag of the vibrating cylinder surpasses the drag of the stationary one at r e 80 the computations by jaiman et al 2015 for a fixed square cylinder at zero incidence yield c p 0 1 1277 and c p b 0 5726 for the freely vibrating square cylinder the values of c p 0 and c p b at a comparative r e of 75 see section 5 1 2 underscore that vibrations significantly reduce the value of c p b in addition pressure recovery with vibrations is much less as compared to those of a stationary cylinder this explains the higher drag with vibrating cylinders the relationship of r m s of drag with r e is depicted in fig 6b in general c d r m s is considerably smaller than c l r m s when vortex shedding is strong eg r e 75 it enhances the c p fluctuations more on the shoulders than at the stagnation points figs 3a and 3b hence c l r m s exceeds c d r m s when vortex shedding is weak eg r e 95 c p fluctuations at the shoulders fall drastically fig 4b for such cases c d r m s surpasses c l r m s as apparent from the discussions in section 5 1 2 stronger the vortex shedding larger the fluctuations of c p at cylinder shoulders and larger the c l r m s therefore the magnitude of c l r m s indicates the strength of vortex shedding lam and wei 2010 yang and wu 2013 kumar et al 2018b fig 6c plots the r m s of lift with r e and u up to r e 75 i e for dsi initial branch and beginning of lower branch c l r m s rises monotonically implying gradual strengthening of vortex shedding subsequently c l r m s falls with r e and attains its least value at r e 96 where s t y is also minimum this suggests that vortex shedding at r e 96 is extremely weak the closure of lower branch lock in is hence associated with the occurrence of minimum of s t y as well as c l r m s in the dsii regime r e 96 c l r m s again rises with r e amplification of c l r m s however does not affect the response fig 2b since c l and y are out of phase in this regime of decoherence see section 5 3 9 c d c l lissajou diagrams shown in the insets of fig 6c for r e 75 95 and 240 further ascertain the periodic nature of the flow each phase plot suggests for a zero value of mean lift force the zero mean lift results from symmetric mean pressure distribution between the upper and lower surfaces of the square absence of unbalanced lift therefore suggests for zero mean y and shedding of identical but opposite signed vorticity in each shedding cycle for 1 1 synchronization the most common type of wake mode is 2s and its variant c 2s 5 1 4 wake modes of vortex formation figs 7a 7b and 7c respectively illustrate the wake vortex modes at r e 75 95 and 230 corresponding to high and low amplitude transverse displacements of the oscillator the instantaneous vorticity snapshots indicate that the wake modes are c 2s and 2s respectively this corroborates with the discussion in section 5 1 3 from these contours one can have an idea of relative strength of vortex shedding at the reynolds numbers considered as discussed in previous sub sections the magnitude of r m s lift is an indicator of the strength of vortex shedding higher the c l r m s higher is the strength and vice versa from fig 6c depicting the c l r m s r e relationship it is found that c l r m s at r e 75 c l r m s at r e 230 c l r m s at r e 95 therefore strength of vortex shedding is maximum at r e 75 corresponding to maximum oscillation frequency in lock in and minimum at r e 95 corresponding to minimum oscillation frequency in lock in this is consistent with the facts that the phenomenon of lock in enhances the strength of vortex shedding park 1981 and vibrations enhance the strength of vortices ferguson and parkinson 1967 toebes 1969 as apparent from fig 7 for comparable downstream distance the intervortex spacing is minimum for r e 75 and maximum for r e 95 it implies that in a given time interval the maximum number of vortices are shed at r e 75 followed by r e 230 and 95 in consistency with the relative magnitude of c l r m s at r e 75 95 and 230 this order of longitudinal intervortex spacing with r e indirectly suggests that vortex shedding is strongest at r e 75 followed by r e 230 and 95 for forced motion of a circular cylinder at r e 200 with frequencies other than the natural frequency koopmann 1967 experimentally found that the longitudinal spacing between wake vortices decreases at higher oscillation frequency at lower oscillation frequency this trend of spacing reversed in context of forced motion of a circular cylinder at r e 144 and 190 griffin and ramberg 1974 experimentally observed in the lock in regime that the lateral spacing of vortices in the wake depends on the oscillation amplitude higher the amplitude smaller the lateral spacing they further noted that the oscillation frequency affects the rate of vorticity generation as well as the ratio of lateral and longitudinal spacing of vortices in the wake thus governs the development of the wake in particular the longitudinal spacing between vortices was found to vary inversely with the oscillation frequency this explains the closeness of like sign wake vortices at r e 75 compared to those at r e 95 5 2 overview of vibration and flow characteristics for m 4 5 2 1 synchronization and response towards higher values of r e the s t r e curve undergoes significant modification as m is increased from 3 to 4 as illustrated in fig 8a for m 4 s t y and s t c l converge up to r e 197 this is the pre galloping regime comprising of dsi initial branch lower branch and dsii divergence of s t y from s t c l via a sharp drop of s t y at r e 198 or u 13 76 marks the onset of galloping cui et al 2015 li et al 2019 the dsii galloping transition involves a change of slope of the s t y r e profile at r e 197 s t y diverges from s t c l in the galloping regime such that s t y s t c l during galloping motion s t c l increases slowly with r e while s t y continues to fall the magnitude of s t y is one order lower than the one for s t c l a jump discontinuity in y m a x fig 8b at r e 198 reflects the onset of galloping thereafter the response undergoes monotonic rise the onset of lock in and attainment of peak transverse response occur simultaneously at r e 77 coincidence of these events with m 4 as opposed to their divergence with m 3 signifies the essential role of mass ratio however s t y attains its peak at r e 78 therefore even with m 4 onset of lock in does not signify the beginning of lower branch prior to the onset of galloping the flow and body motion are periodic with single frequency the dsii galloping transition is associated with transition from periodic to quasi periodic flow and body motion fig 8c presents a close up of this transition regime the flow oscillations remain quasi periodic up to the maximum reynolds number of 250 considered along the path of decreasing r e the response is quasi periodic in the galloping regime as well as the upper extremity of dsii at r e 197 fig 8i elsewhere in dsii it is periodic primary hysteresis is absent and secondary hysteresis exists only at a discrete point i e the terminal point of dsii corresponding to r e 197 the solutions at r e 197 along the increasing and decreasing paths are periodic fig 8h and quasi periodic fig 8i respectively this is the reason that solutions differ or turn hysteretic at this point time traces of lift fig 8d and cross stream response fig 8f establish the quasi periodic nature of oscillation and flow at r e 198 the respective power spectra are shown in figs 8e and 8g each power spectrum consists of a pair of peaks corresponding to s t y and s t c l respectively the vortex shedding frequency obtained via fft of c l fig 8e corresponds to the dominant peak at s t 0 176 the weaker peak with s t 0 0475 relates to the oscillation frequency the peaks for y are of identical strength fig 8g with s t y 0 049 and s t c l 0 175 the ratio of the larger to smaller frequency is 3 57 an irrational number this further ascertains the quasi periodicity of y the trajectory of cylinder centre suggests that the oscillations are periodic at r e 197 fig 8h and quasi periodic at r e 197 decreasing fig 8i 198 fig 8j 199 fig 8k and 250 fig 8l in summary for m 4 the oscillations are periodic viv at low r e and quasi periodic galloping at high r e in the viv regime an 1 1 synchronization exists between transverse oscillations and vortex shedding however for galloping motion at r e 198 oscillation and vortex shedding frequencies maintain a ratio of 1 3 59 that is different from but quite close to 1 3 several earlier studies bearman et al 1987 zhao et al 2014a sen and mittal 2015 2016 identified an 1 3 sub harmonic synchronization between transverse oscillations and vortex shedding in the galloping branch for representative r e in the viv and galloping regimes table 4 lists the values of oscillation and shedding frequencies along with their ratios 5 2 2 the surface pressure time averaged pressure along the cylinder surface is depicted in fig 9 for r e 200 and 240 respectively corresponding to low and high amplitude galloping oscillations the pressure profiles are quite similar to their viv counterparts fig 5 for m 3 symmetry of each c p curve about the base point eliminates the possibility of asymmetric wake in the galloping regime the pressure differential between points e and f increases as r e is increased from 200 to 240 therefore c d continues to increase in the galloping branch 5 2 3 wake modes of vortex formation an 1 3 sub harmonic synchronization suggests the equivalence of one oscillation cycle to three cycles of vortex shedding therefore three pairs of opposite signed vortices are shed in each oscillation cycle sen and mittal 2016 discussed that under such condition the possible wake vortex arrangements are unstable 2s or 3 2s for quasi periodic galloping and 2p 2s for periodic galloping an additional constraint for formation of 2p 2s mode is that y m a x d must be equal to or greater than 0 7 sen and mittal 2015 for m 4 galloping is quasi periodic and the maximum value of normalized y response is 0 3644 at r e 250 with this background it is obvious that the possible wake mode in the galloping branch is n 2s where n is the nearest integer of s t c l s t y ratio for m 4 n 3 4 and 5 since formation of the wake mode is a function of y m a x williamson and roshko 1988 and m 4 oscillator involves low amplitude galloping the vortices contributing to n 2s mode do not interact among themselves to construct complex modes they instead travel downstream as continuation of 2s vortices the instantaneous vorticity in the galloping regime is shown in fig 10a for r e 198 and 10b for r e 240 respectively even though the wake mode looks very similar to 2s in both cases these are respectively 3 2s and 4 2s since synchronization is close to 1 3 and 1 4 in context with free vibrations of a rigid square cylinder at high r e zhao et al 2014a suggests that the number of vortices contributing to wake mode increases with increase of the ratio of vortex shedding to cylinder oscillation frequency for 1 3 synchronization they resolved the 3 2s wake vortex mode for free vibrations of an isolated square cylinder at r e 200 bhatt and alam 2018 recently resolved the n 2s wake mode with n 9 for undamped transverse only motion of an isolated square cylinder of m 10 li et al 2019 reported the identification of 4 2s mode at r e 150 and u 20 5 3 transition from viv to combined viv and galloping the results presented in sections 5 1 and 5 2 hint that the mass ratio for first occurrence of galloping motion of a square cylinder for r e 250 is bracketed by m 3 and 4 to determine the value of this mass ratio computations have been performed for several intermediate values of m by analysing the lock in and response characteristics for these m it is found that the transition occurs for m 3 4 the fluid forces at m 3 4 however do not exhibit any noticeable amplification relative to the pure viv case of m 3 3 in the galloping regime 5 3 1 determination of transition m from lock in and response characteristics fig 11 depicts the relationship of s t and cross stream response with r e for m 3 3 3 4 and 3 5 the characteristics for m 3 3 figs 11a and 11b are very similar to those of m 3 relative to m 3 3 the lock in and response patterns for m 3 4 figs 11c and 11d and 3 5 figs 11e and 11f exhibit significant departure at higher r e these instead closely follow the traits of m 4 oscillator for the square cylinder executing free undamped vibrations an additional galloping branch appears for the first time when the value of m reaches 3 4 this is the lowest value of mass ratio required for the onset of galloping motion for r e 250 the value of oscillation frequency at the onset of galloping 0 0397 drops to about 25 of the corresponding value at the onset of lock in 0 1611 the lock in in the galloping branch is soft as noted for low m oscillators irrespective of m the minimum value of r e at which inception of galloping occurs in a square cylinder is of the order of 150 the corresponding values of critical reynolds number predicted by barrero gil et al 2009 joly et al 2012 and sen and mittal 2015 are 159 140 and 165 respectively the value of critical reduced speed is 11 514 sen and mittal 2015 2016 according to li et al 2019 galloping occurs at a critical reduced speed exceeding 10 the implication of these critical values towards occurrence of galloping is that for any value of mass ratio and reduced speed the flow reynolds number must exceed 150 and similarly for any value of m and r e the reduced speed must surpass the limit of 11 514 else the motion will be purely viv it therefore appears that the mass ratio assumes importance as a key controlling parameter for transition of viv to galloping when both r e and u simultaneously surpass their respective critical values the further insightful implication of fig 11 is that above the critical r e transition of viv to combined viv and galloping relies on three parameters i e m r e and u the role of mass ratio can be understood considering the case of m 3 transition m where galloping is absent even when r e 150 and u 11 514 figs 2a and 2b the occurrence of galloping therefore is a function of certain combinations of m r e and u in each of which r e 150 and u 11 514 one such combination is for m transition m either r e 150 or u 11 5 but both r e and u must surpass their critical limits joly et al 2012 reported low amplitude galloping of an m 3 3 4 square cylinder at r e 200 150 and u 40 11 5 considering identical value of u of 40 as used by joly et al 2012 and the lowest permissible value of r e 150 li et al 2019 recently determined the transition mass ratio for transition of viv of a square cylinder to galloping they found that transition m 4 however this value of the transition mass ratio is non unique several values of the transition mass ratios can be determined by altering u and keeping r e fixed at 150 eq 8 of sen and mittal 2015 suggests that the transition m varies inversely with r e or u hence the value of the transition mass ratio can be reduced by increasing both r e and u this suggests that the value of the transition mass ratio is a function of the range of reynolds number considered an open question that arises here is that can we continue to increase r e so that galloping occurs with whatever small the mass ratio be alternately does a square cylinder of extremely small mass ratio gallop or whether there exists a limiting mass ratio below which a square cylinder does not gallop irrespective of reynolds number or reduced speed these thoughts are out of scope of the current work and will not be discussed extensive three dimensional computations are required to address the aforesaid queries three events that draw utmost attention in the viv regime are the onset of lock in occurrence of maximum transverse response and occurrence of maximum of oscillation or vortex shedding frequency the relationship among these events depends solely on m as evident from the first second fourth and fifth columns of table 5 depending on the occurrence of these events three regimes of m are identified i 3 m 3 4 the events occur independent of r e onset of lock in and subsequent attainment of peak response take place in the initial branch lower branch initiates after the lock in sets in ii 3 4 m 4 the onset of lock in involves maximum response initial branch however beginning of lower branch is still a post lock in phenomenon iii 5 m 20 the onset of lock in coincides the same r e with occurrence of maximum s t y and the onset marks the beginning of lower branch the data in last three rows in table 5 is reproduced from sen and mittal 2015 as the value of m surpasses 3 4 the reynolds number or u marking the dsii galloping transition continues to fall the r e indicating the onset of lock in on the other hand increases 5 3 2 implications of the transition mass ratio as discussed in section 5 3 1 the transition mass ratio can be lowered below 3 4 by increasing r e and or u sufficiently beyond their critical values this study raises the question that can one lower the m indefinitely and still the cylinder exhibits galloping it may be possible that even after satisfying the den hartog stability criterion a square cylinder of sufficiently low mass ratio may not execute galloping extensive studies are required to conclusively comment on this possibility the mass ratios of the order of 10 correspond to hydroelastic vibrations therefore the order of magnitude of the predicted transition mass ratio is relevant for offshore structures where several risers are packed together within a square shaped envelope joly et al 2012 in designing such structures containing bundles of riser cables the prediction of possibility of galloping and its outcome on the structure is of paramount importance damblans et al 2013 in general offshore structures that are exposed to ocean currents undergo flow induced vibrations these undesirable vibrations reduce the lifetime of such structures and the structures may eventually fail due to fatigue the transition mass ratio predicted by us provides a safety limit for structures below which high amplitude galloping oscillations get suppressed therefore the material as well as dimensions of the oscillator can be selected such that the mass ratio becomes of the order of 3 4 or smaller so as to minimize the possibility of transition of flow induced motion to galloping for transverse galloping barrero gil et al 2010 analysed the mechanism of extracting energy from the surrounding flow the transition mass ratio therefore defines the lower limit of m that can be employed for harvesting the energy from flow 5 3 3 the in line response characteristics sourav and sen 2017 suggested that because of non zero value of mean drag the in line response is always positive and value of the time averaged x is also non zero evident from lissajou diagrams of fig 8h through 8l and fig 15 of the current paper the mean transverse response is however zero valued as opposed to the maximum streamwise response the r m s of in line response x r m s is independent of location of the origin of the coordinate system and hence is a better indicator of streamwise response the in line response assumes importance for low m the dependence of x r m s on r e is illustrated via figs 12a 12b and 12c for m 3 3 3 4 and 3 5 respectively all the branches pertaining to the y response are quite apparent also from the x r m s r e plots it is found that the reynolds number corresponding to the maximum of x r m s and y m a x is identical 75 5 3 4 inherent quasi periodicity of galloping at onset up to the upper boundary of dsii s t y and s t c l converge the frequency domain is therefore characterized by a single dominant frequency galloping is a soft lock in phenomenon where f n s t y and s t c l differ from each other such that s t y is much closer to f n than s t c l figs 8a 11c and 11e the frequency domain therefore consists of both s t y and s t c l this is the reason that the galloping oscillations are inherently quasi periodic at its origin and thereafter as apparent from fig 13a for m 3 4 the body motion is periodic at the terminal point of dsii i e r e 229 time traces of y at r e 230 fig 13b and 240 fig 13c suggest that galloping at its origin involves quasi periodicity and retains this behaviour for the entire range of r e considered for m 3 3 and 3 4 fig 14 shows the power spectra of c l and y at representative r e a single dominant peak in the spectra of c l and y ascertains periodic flow and rigid body motion for m 3 3 at r e 250 figs 14a and 14b figs 14c and 14d establish periodicity one extremely weak and one dominant peak in y spectrum single peak in c l spectrum for m 3 4 at r e 229 marking end of dsii for the same m transition to quasi periodicity at r e 230 is ensured via existence of a pair of peaks corresponding to s t y and s t c l in each fft figs 14e and 14f the quasi periodic nature of galloping is further evidenced from fig 15 which presents for m 3 4 and 3 5 the trajectory of the cylinder centre at representative reynolds numbers in the galloping branch similar to the lissajou diagrams in the viv regime figs 2c and 2d the phase portraits preserve symmetry about y 0 the essence of this observation is the vanishing of mean lift symmetry of mean surface pressure about cylinder base and shedding of equal number of clockwise and counterclockwise vortices in an oscillation cycle absence of asymmetric wake mode for each m table 6 summarizes the spectral behaviour of individual response branches 5 3 5 existence of hysteresis near dsii galloping transition hysteresis or solution multiplicity is a well known feature of fsi sen and mittal 2015 found that the solutions are completely hysteresis free for m 1 i e when the cylinder executes viv alone for m 5 they noted weak primary hysteresis near the onset of lock in and strong secondary hysteresis close to the beginning of galloping for m 3 3 3 4 and 3 5 respectively the first second and third rows of fig 11 ascertain absence of primary hysteresis for m 3 4 a regime of secondary hysteresis exists towards the closure of dsii hysteresis is however not experienced at the inception of galloping or at other r e in the galloping branch interestingly the first occurrence of galloping at m 3 4 is associated with the presence of a wide secondary hysteresis region hinting towards a possible link between them towards the upper extremity of dsii solutions along increasing r e computations are periodic those for decreasing r e are quasi periodic for instance see figs 8h and 8i for m 4 at r e 197 and 197 decreasing respectively since the initial condition comes from the quasi periodic galloping branch at a given r e the magnitude of y displacement with quasi periodic motion exceeds the one with periodic motion this mismatch in y m a x value leads to the formation of the hysteresis loop 5 3 6 effect of damping on the transition to investigate the effects of structural damping on the transition of viv only motion to combined viv and galloping computations were performed for mass ratios 3 3 and 3 5 bounding the transition mass ratio of 3 4 for these computations ζ was assigned a value of 0 044 while the other parameters were kept identical to those considered for undamped motion the frequency and y response characteristics figs 16a and 16b respectively for m 3 3 and 3 5 both reveal that the oscillator motion is purely viv and devoid of galloping a damped viv therefore transits to galloping at higher mass ratio or alternately introduction of damping delays the transition of viv only motion to combined viv and galloping for a flexible square cylinder subject to wind flow abdel rohman 1994 analytically found that introduction of moderate structural damping results in occurrence of galloping at higher values of incoming wind speed i e the onset of galloping gets delayed for m 3 5 the oscillation frequency under damped and undamped conditions is compared in fig 16c the absence of low frequency segment with damped vibrations indicates that the motion is viv only for the same mass ratio fig 16d compares the transverse response of undamped and damped motion the decaying response in lower branch and absence of galloping with ζ 0 044 ascertains the stabilizing nature of structural damping 5 3 7 effect of galloping on fluid loading for m 3 4 as apparent from the discussions above the occurrence of galloping for m 3 4 is associated with appreciable rise in y m a x x r m s and fall in s t y the change of trend of response and oscillation frequency with r e is however not reflected by c d and c l r m s shown in figs 17a and 17b respectively the c d and c l r m s curves for m 3 3 3 4 and 3 5 are virtually identical rendering the determination of transition m from fluid forces practically impossible the essence of identical fluid loading is that cylinder surface pressure for an arbitrary r e in the galloping branch must be very similar for m 3 3 3 4 and 3 5 in other words galloping at its inception is unable to modify the surface pressure corresponding to dsii regime this is evident from fig 17c 17d and 17e depicting the mean pressure and close up of c p 0 and c p b respectively as the value of m is increased to 4 the galloping branch becomes highly discernible from the dsii regime as slope change of both c d and c l r m s at the onset of galloping is very prominent 5 3 8 wake vortex modes the instantaneous vorticity field at r e 240 is shown in fig 18a 18b and 18c for m 3 3 3 4 and 3 5 respectively for m 3 3 the cylinder executes viv alone thus synchronization between transverse oscillations and vortex shedding is 1 1 hence the wake mode is 2s for m 3 4 and 3 5 the 1 1 ratio deems invalid in the galloping branch and the wake mode deviates from the basic 2s the mode in such cases belongs to the n 2s set discussed in section 5 2 3 5 3 9 phase between c l and y the oscillation and vortex shedding frequencies differ for the galloping cylinder and in a strict sense phase angle ϕ between c l and y cannot be defined in such cases a phase angle can still be represented by the time lag between the signals the lag or time delay between c l and y is computed from the time distribution of cross correlation function r between the signals the time lag corresponding to the maximum value of r is a measure of ϕ the ratio of time lag and time period of dominant oscillation frequency provides the value of ϕ in radian for the m 3 4 cylinder fig 19a plots the time traces of c l and y at r e 250 time series of the cross correlation between c l and y is shown in fig 19b the highlighted portion of fig 19b is shown with exaggeration in fig 19c from here we obtain the value of normalized time lag corresponding to the maximum r as 2 49 the time period of oscillations computed from fft of y signal equals 26 73 therefore the phase angle between lift and transverse displacement at r e 250 is 2 49 26 73 36 0 33 54 the phase angle as a function of r e is plotted in fig 19d for a pair of m corresponding to viv only motion m 3 3 and both viv and galloping m 3 4 also superimposed is the variation of cross stream response for each mass ratio the lift and transverse displacement are in phase up to r e 95 a phase shift by about 180 occurs at r e 96 where the vortex shedding becomes extremely weak and lock in terminates for m 3 3 the out of phase relationship prevails over the rest of the r e considered in contrast for m 3 4 ϕ drops further at r e 230 corresponding to the onset of galloping the value of ϕ in the galloping branch lies in the range of 33 42 the ϕ r e profiles therefore signify that c l and y are in phase in dsi initial branch and lower branch they are out of phase in dsii in the galloping branch the values of ϕ tend towards in phase for in phase condition c l aids y and for out of phase c l obstructs y in dsi and initial branch rise of y with r e is consistent with increasing strength of vortex shedding in the lower branch y m a x drops with r e even though c l and y are in phase this results from weakening of vortex shedding and consequent decay of c l r m s with increasing r e monotonic rise of s t c l and c l r m s in the galloping regime indicates that shedding is again significant because of low magnitude of ϕ an effective component of c l exists to aid y the magnitude of y therefore depends on the magnitude of c l r m s or strength of vortex shedding as well as ϕ for both m c l y phase portraits at selected r e are shown in fig 19e through 19g the ratio of the intercept of the c l y plot with y 0 line and projection of the portrait on the y 0 line provides an estimate of the phase angle between c l and y the out of phase relationship between periodic c l and y and 1 1 synchronization between them one closed loop with no cross over point for m 3 3 at r e 250 are obvious from fig 19e for m 3 4 phase portraits at r e 230 fig 19f and 250 fig 19g indicate that c l and y are quasi periodic and not out of phase 5 4 discussion on possible transition to three dimensionality for r e 200 for stationary square circular cylinders the three dimensional wake transition involves the mode a and b instabilities for a stationary square cylinder at zero incidence sohankar et al 1999 conducted direct numerical simulations using a blockage of 5 6 and concluded that the flow turns three dimensional at some r e between 150 and 200 sheard et al 2009 numerically captured the inception of three dimensional instability mode a at r e 164 yoon et al 2012 suggests that the wake transition occurs when r e exceeds 165 the corresponding values presented by choi et al 2012 park and yang 2016 and jiang and cheng 2018 are 166 5 166 6 and 165 7 respectively however under the conditions of free or forced vibrations of a cylinder the reynolds number marking the three dimensional wake transition increases and flow remains two dimensional even beyond the critical r e corresponding to a fixed cylinder some studies reporting this delaying effect due to vibrations are presented below based on direct measurements toebes 1969 argued that strong oscillations guard the region of separation against three dimensional wake distortions in other words oscillations strengthen the correlation of vortex shedding along the length of the oscillator novak and tanaka 1975 also reported enhancement of spanwise coherence of flow and fluid loading due to vibrations in context of viv of a long circular cylinder at r e 500 blackburn and henderson 1999 also reported that oscillations suppress three dimensionality thus render the near wake to be two dimensional for viv of a rigid circular cylinder at r e 300 evangelinos and karniadakis 1999 numerically demonstrated that the near wake x d 10 exhibits two dimensional behaviour for forced transverse vibrations of a circular cylinder leontini et al 2007 found that the transition reynolds number increases to 280 from its stationary counterpart of about 190 zhao et al 2014b conducted extensive numerical investigations for transverse viv of a circular cylinder of m 2 over r e 150 1000 the reduced speed was varied from 2 to 12 both two and three dimensional computations were performed for the vibrating circular cylinder zhao et al 2014b found that the value of critical reynolds number marking the transition to three dimensionality turns higher as compared to the one obtained from its stationary counterpart the flow around the vibrating cylinder was found to remain completely two dimensional at least up to r e 250 zhao et al 2014b also observed the insensitivity of vortex shedding and lift force to the spanwise direction based on immersed boundary computations for transversely only motion of a circular cylinder of m 2 4 and 100 du et al 2014 concluded that vibrations increase the critical reynolds number for transition to three dimensionality they noted that the wake of a vibrating circular cylinder at r e 300 is very similar to that of a two dimensional wake and transition to three dimensionality occurs when r e is increased from 350 to 425 in view of these the two dimensional computations for r e 200 are expected to adequately predict the features of flow and body motion 6 conclusions the study by sen and mittal 2015 concerning free undamped vibrations of a rigid square cylinder along and across the flow demonstrates that the cylinder executes viv for m 1 while for m 5 its motion is viv at low r e and galloping at high r e the existence of a mass ratio bounded by the 1 5 interval and marking the transition from viv only motion to viv followed by galloping is therefore quite obvious by direct computations based on a stabilized space time finite element formulation the value of this transition m obtained in the present work is 3 4 for m 3 4 the oscillations are purely viv and solutions unique or non hysteretic a square shaped oscillator satisfies the den hartog stability criterion and hence is prone to galloping the most essential conclusion of the current work is that it also takes into consideration the effects of mass ratio reynolds number reduced speed and structural damping in influencing the transition from viv to viv and galloping this study indicates that the den hartog criterion is solely insufficient to determine whether a non axisymmetric oscillator such as a square will gallop irrespective of the values of m r e u and ζ it is found that introduction of damping delays the transition or increases the transition mass ratio this study raises a quest that a square oscillator of sufficiently low m may not gallop even after satisfying the den hartog criterion however further extensive studies may deterministically reach to such a conclusion non unique solutions at a given r e are characteristic to hysteresis in the context of free vibrations of a square cylinder two discrete sets of solutions are obtained close to the transition from dsii to galloping dsii solutions along the forward computations are essentially periodic galloping being a soft lock in phenomenon is inherently quasi periodic at its inception for 3 4 m 4 the entire galloping branch is quasi periodic the initial condition for backward computations must come from the galloping branch and hence is quasi periodic backward solutions at certain r e in the dsii are therefore quasi periodic the quasi periodic nature of galloping at its onset therefore ensures that the dsii galloping transition must be hysteretic based on the correlation among occurrence of maximum s t maximum y and onset of lock in three distinct regimes of m bounded by its values of 3 and 20 are identified for 3 m 3 4 these events are uncorrelated i e they occur at different r e the onset of lock in and occurrence of maximum y are coincident at same r e or u for 3 4 m 4 all three events are in complete correlation for 5 m 20 irrespective of m mean surface pressure at each r e is symmetric about the base point this ensures the disappearance of mean lift i e mean c l 0 consequently mean y 0 as expected irrespective of the resonance branch the x y and c d c l phase portraits exhibit symmetry about the mean of y or c l in context of free undamped vibrations of a square cylinder absence of any unbalanced lift force in each shedding cycle therefore eliminates the possibility of any asymmetric wake vortex mode to form for viv the wake vortex mode is 2s or c 2s however in galloping branch time period of an oscillation cycle is quite larger than vortex shedding cycle in such cases the wake mode is denoted by the symbol n 2s where n is the nearest integer of the s t c l s t y ratio because of low amplitude galloping the vortices shed in an oscillation cycle do not reorganize to form a complex mode the phase between lift force as input and transverse response as output is computed from the lag in cross correlation function between them the quantities are in phase in dsi initial branch and most of lower branch out of phase relationship prevails over the whole of dsii in the galloping branch ϕ lies between 33 and 42 so that there always exists a component of c l causing amplification of response the magnitude of response is a function of both strength of vortex

section 4 2 methods for distribution functions a brief characterization of the proposed methods for prediction of distributional properties of extreme wave heights will be given firstly the maximum entropy method and afterwards an overview of gpd and gev as particular forms of extreme value theory 2 1 maximum entropy method maxent maximum entropy has been introduced within the field of thermodynamics but later on through statistical mechanics it gained popularity as a promising concept for inference processes in physical systems with limited data i e limited information about it this method has been recently used in a variety of scientific disciplines including in ocean engineering where it has been used as an important tool in long term prediction of wave height extremes e g dong et al 2013a petrov et al 2013 since long and reliable wave height records are not always available the authors were keen on testing the skills of maxent method for the extrapolation of extremes wave heights where the obtained probability distribution function would be characterized solely from the data obtained from the sample by using a set of statistical moments according to the principle of maximum entropy jaynes 1957 the probability distribution that maximizes information entropy while satisfying the available information constraints is arguably the best estimate i e the least biased distribution among all possible distributions that comply with given information constraints while being noncommittal to the missing information the maxent algorithm used in this work uses the algorithm of gotovac and gotovac 2009 which maximizes shannon s formulation of the information entropy shannon 1948 defined as 1 s f x m i n x m a x l n f x f x d x in which l n f x is the quantity of information and f the probability distribution function f d p as information constraints are given in the form of known statistical moments derived from the pot sample of significant wave heights the maxent model produces the least biased distribution by maximizing the entropy in order to derive the resulting distribution obtained by the maxent model one has to solve the next optimization problem 2a m a x s f forced to 2b x m i n x m a x h i x f x d x μ i i 0 m where the constraints are the statistical moments of the arbitrary basis functions h i x i 0 m a given optimization problem has been determined by transforming it from an unconstrained convex optimization problem by using the lagrangian function with the corresponding multipliers and adaptive romberg integration as demonstrated in berger et al 1996 an improved iterative scaling has been used as an optimization technique while opting for chebyshev polynomials instead of the classical monomials as a basis function contributed additionally to a more stable numerical algorithm as demonstrated in bandyopadhyay et al 2005 the resulting probability density function obtained with a given maxent algorithm is given as 3 f x e x p 1 j 0 m γ j t j x where m is the number of constraining moments γ j are lagrangian multipliers and t j x are chebyshev polynomials detailed presentation of the maxent algorithm along with the numerical procedure is given in gotovac and gotovac 2009 the original maxent algorithm of gotovac and gotovac 2009 has been customized here only in terms of normalizing the affiliating domain of the maxent s pdf in order to be suitable for pot samples of significant wave heights and therefore fully consistent with the competing gpd model as presented in petrov et al 2013 normalization of the maxent distributions domain has been obtained by setting arbitrarily the boundaries of the domain as x m i n x m a x prior to analyses the choice of the lower boundary is implicitly obvious x m μ as it is determined by the threshold value used in the particular pot sample on the other hand the upper boundary of the domain is subject to an arbitrary choice and reflects the asymptotic limit of the distribution in the right tail zone and therefore has to be carefully selected the selection procedure of x m a x is thoroughly discussed in the following section with a demonstration on available wave height data sets besides the arbitrary choice of domain boundaries the maxent model is constrained also by the number of sample moments m that are included in the analysis in this work the maxent model has been constrained with sample moments up to the fourth order increasing the number of moments m included in the formulation of the maxent model over arbitrarily selected up to fourth order m 4 would have an insignificant impact to resulting maxent s estimates of high return levels e g 100 year significant wave heights the accuracy of a given high quantile produced with the maximum entropy model constrained by up to the fourth order moment may be quantified with the last significant figure which takes the value of 10 2 for the estimates of the 100 year return level which is good enough for applications in the coastal and ocean engineering practice the return value x p associated to the p year return period t p is calculated by deriving the inverse of the maxent cumulative distribution with the corresponding probability 1 1 t p n y where n y is an average annual number of observations in a given pot sample furthermore the bootstrapping technique has been used to quantify the uncertainty of the maxent model the confidence interval for estimates of return values generated by the maximum entropy model was produced by using hundred bootstrap samples which were produced by resampling with replacement from original pot samples this approach is consistent with the mle estimators around the return values that were obtained with the models gpd or gev due to fact that maximum likelihood estimates are asymptotically normally distributed hosking and wallis 1987 2 2 extreme value theory evt methods according to petrov et al 2013 evt serves as an analogy to the central limit theorem clt the statistical behaviour of sample maxima m n m a x x 1 x n where x 1 x n is a sequence of independent random variables and can be characterized by one of three families of distributions gumbel fréchet and reverse weibull in the a m annual maxima method the h s measured in a regular time scale is represented by x which means that m n stands for maximum value over 1 year the statistical behaviour of annual maxima is described by a distribution that belongs to the generalized extreme value g e v family of distributions defined as 4 g x e x p 1 ξ x μ σ 1 ξ the distribution is defined on x 1 ξ x μ σ 0 where μ σ 0 ξ the generalized extreme value distribution gev is composed of three parameters μ which is the location parameter σ is the scale parameter and ξ is the shape parameter the gev model has finite ξ 0 or infinite ξ 0 upper end point depending on the shape parameter by inverting expression 4 it is possible to estimate the return values i e extreme quantiles associated with the return period t p 5 z p μ σ ξ 1 l o g 1 p ξ ξ 0 μ σ l o g l o g 1 p ξ 0 in which g z p 1 p the z p value it is expected to be exceeded once every 1 p years corresponding to the value of t p pot is also a possible method in the scope of extreme value theory it uses all the peaks that are above a certain threshold and not only the annual maxima the use of this method is motivated by the fact that annual maxima may be inappropriate if there is more data within each year of measurement record that can be classified as an extreme the peak over threshold method is based on the fact that like the annual maxima method it has an approximately gev distribution eqn 4 thus peaks above sufficiently high thresholds have the corresponding approximate distribution within the gpd family defined by 6 h y 1 1 ξ y σ 1 ξ in which y x u conditional on x u u is the threshold value the coherence that exists between the extreme value models as gev and gpd means that ξ ξ and σ σ ξ u μ can be related with the purpose of estimating the return levels it is necessary to specify first the exceedance rates of thresholds as λ p x u related to the gev parameters by 7 λ 1 e x p 1 n 1 ξ u μ σ 1 ξ so the mean crossing rate of any level x u is 8 λ 1 ξ x u σ 1 ξ placing expression 8 equal to 1 p the p year return level z p is obtained by 9 z p u σ ξ λ p ξ 1 the parameter estimation of gev and gpd models can be achieved by several techniques in this work the maximum likelihood methodology ml was adopted as described for example in coles 2001 furthermore there are other robust methods that also perform well as described in vandewalle 2004 and the probability weighted moments pwm and l moments pandey et al 2001 3 application of the models to the dataset satellite altimeter measurements of hs over the northern part of atlantic ocean over a period of 20 years 1992 2012 have been used the data were divided into 1 longitude x 1 latitude grid squares and the median along the satellite track was taken in each of them five grid points have been used to study long term extreme behaviour of significant wave heights with the location of the points marked in fig 1 3 1 gev model results the long term behaviour of the datasets was firstly represented by the gev model the gev distribution is fitted to samples of 20 annual maxima of hs medians for each of the selected grid points in fig 2 diagnostic plots for the dataset from grid point no 15 are presented showing return level plot histogram over layered with the distribution function the probability plot and the quantile plot the information provided by these plots indicates the goodness of fit coles 2001 the diagnostic plots of the remaining grid points are not presented since the gev model shows a similar level of agreement with data for all of them instead table 1 summarizes the obtained results presenting the gev parameters and the 100 year return level accompanied with corresponding 95 confidence intervals the value of the shape parameter and the corresponding 95 confidence interval indicate that the fitted gev model for the examined datasets does not exclude that the data follows the gumbel model pattern especially in the case of the most northern grid point point 3 leading possibly to an overestimation of the high return levels on the other side grid point 23 the one closest to the south has a negative value of the shape parameter including the 95 confidence interval leading to a short right tail of the distribution and therefore the smallest value of the 100 year return level estimate 3 2 gpd model results the first step in the pot model is to estimate the threshold range that is high enough to support the asymptotic basis for the gpd model and low enough in order to avoid high variance threshold range has been determined for each of the data sets by the means of graphical tools like the mean residual life plot and the plot that indicate the variation of models parameters depending on the threshold variation the selected threshold range is from 5 to 8 m for all grid points except for the grid point 23 which indicated some linearity of the parameters within the threshold range of 3 6 m additionally since it is known that at lower latitudes the extreme events are occurring far less often than at the higher latitudes the threshold level had to be lowered so as to include an acceptable number of data in the sample as for the gev model the diagnostic plots of the gpd model for the dataset from the grid point no 15 are presented in fig 3 showing return level plot histogram over layered with the distribution function probability plot and quantile plot the presented gpd model fits the pot sample of hs with the threshold level set at 7m quite well moreover a similar level of the agreement with the data is obtained across the whole threshold range and thus those plots are excluded furthermore the diagnostic plots for the rest of the grid points are also skipped here since the gpd model has a similar pattern and a similar level of goodness of fit as well in comparison with the presented grid point 15 to summarize the results obtained with the gpd model table 2 has been prepared which gives information about the size of the scrutinized satellite dataset i e the number of medians and size of the pot sample through the analysed threshold range following with the gpd predicted values of 100 year return level with the corresponding 95 confidence interval for each of them the obtained value of the shape parameter is very close to zero although it stays in the negative zone for all of the data sets except for the grid point 23 the accompanying 95 confidence interval is broad enough for any of the dataset plus threshold value combination leaving the question of the model s domain of attraction open i e weibull or gumbel when comparing the 100 year return levels obtained by the models gpd and gev the agreement is quite notable except for the grid point 23 with the lowest latitude value in the case of the dataset from the grid point 23 gpd model suggests that the gumbel model is the appropriate one leading to values of h s 100 y r roughly around 14m while the gev model indicates the reverse shape of the right tail strongly weibull model with the estimate of the h s 100 y r set at 12m the reason for these fundamentally different results could be the fact that the dataset observed at grid point 23 has very few extreme events and the smaller wave heights do not follow the same parent distribution as the higher or extreme wave heights 3 3 maxent model results in comparison with gpd and gev maxent has a different theoretical foundation i e it is a non parametric method the maxent method proved to be successful when estimating the extreme wave heights as presented in petrov et al 2013 the numerical process of maxent used in this work is defined on the finite domain so the maxent was used on the same pot samples by having the same range of threshold values as in the analysis with the gpd model employing maxent in pot samples legitimates the utilization of the truncated domain of the maxent model the lower boundary is fixed by the selected threshold and the upper boundary is chosen arbitrarily the upper bound has to be sufficiently high in order to produce a pdf that is not a truncated version of the real pdf in the right tail region due to the limited domain of the model still a very large upper limit of the model could lead to an artificially extended version of the real pdf and therefore would induce smoothing by testing the maxent model on domains that have lower boundary defined with the threshold value of the sample and a range of different upper boundaries the optimal value for the upper end point of the domain for the maxent model is selected fig 4 presents the estimates of 25 50 100 1000 and 10 000 year return levels obtained with the maxent employed on a dataset from the grid point 15 with the lower boundary at 7m and the upper boundary between 20m and 40m are shown the value 30m is adopted as an ideal value for the upper boundary of the maxent model domain since it can be noticed that it is a value for which higher quantiles became approximately constant before it once again starts to rise due to the extended domain the value 30m is adopted for all of the data sets since similar patterns are identified in those cases sample moments until the fourth order have been used as a constraint in the formulation of the maxents pdf the achieved accuracy of the obtained high quantiles i e 100 year return levels generated by the maxent model have value 10 2 to be the last significant figure being sufficient for practical engineering purposes including higher order moments into the formulation would have an insignificant difference to the accuracy of the adopted maxent model with moments up to the fourth order to give an insight of the sensitivity of the maxent model on the choice of m i e order of the sample moments constraints the estimates of 25 50 100 1000 and 10000 year return values obtained with the maxent model applied on the data from the grid point 15 are presented on the fig 5 with lower and upper boundary set on 7m and 30m respectively while varying number of moments used as constraints are between 2 and 6 to give an example how maxent model fits the data the return level plot and density plot are presented in fig 6 and fig 7 respectively for the maxent model applied to the data set from the grid point 15 with the threshold value set at 7m which can be directly compared with the gpd model which has been already presented previously on fig 3 the 95 confidence interval for maxent is produced by employing the model to 100 bootstrap samples generated from the original sample considering that the variation of bootstrap maxent estimates of the high return levels is normally distributed the 95 confidence interval was estimated the maxent model fits the data with a similar level of goodness of fit but at the same time have a significantly smaller envelope of uncertainty presented with the 95 confidence interval a similar pattern of smaller uncertainty gap for maxent model in comparison to the results obtained with the gpd has been identified and in other combinations of dataset and threshold value the above statement can be verified by comparing the summarized results of the maxent 100 year return levels along with 95 confidence intervals for all examined data sets presented in table 2 this robustness of the maxent to the sample size has been demonstrated also by petrov et al 2013 in general the results achieved by the maxent model correspond well with the ones obtained with gpd and gev models table 2 presents the results of the return levels for the maximum entropy point the bootstrap 95 confidence intervals with the bootstrap average of the return level estimates the bias estimated between the average of return levels obtained with maxent model employed on bootstrap samples and the return levels obtained with maxent model employed on original sample for each of the tested thresholds and datasets is relatively small that is the return levels estimated from the original samples fall within 95 confidence interval around the corresponding bootstrap means the comparison of the models maxent and gpd is shown in table 2 the maxent model exhibits greater stability and less variability than the competitive gpd model through the same threshold range for all datasets indicating reliable tail estimates with lower variability than gpd moreover if these high quantiles are compared also with the return levels produced with gev model as shown in table 1 it can be identified that there is a significant level of similarity between the gev gpd and maxent model 4 discussion in order to summarize the results of the extreme analysis obtained by employing the gev the gpd and the maxent model in samples of significant wave heights derived from the satellite altimeter observations figs 8 10 are obtained the left part of the figs 8 10 is presenting the variation of the 100 year return level along with corresponding 95 confidence interval produced with the gpd and maxent by fitting the pot samples while the right side of the figures is reserved for the gev model employed on am samples the pot and am approaches produce close estimates of high return levels of wave height except for the dataset from grid point 23 with the lowest latitude value where those two approaches give reverse suggestions about the right tail leading to estimates of h s 100 y r a p p 12m for gev model and h s 100 y r a p p 14m for the gpd and maxent further within the pot approach two competing models give similar values of high return values but with the distinctive difference in the uncertainty gap i e the size of the 95 confidence interval envelope across the whole threshold range and for all of the examined datasets i e grid points the maxent method produces smaller 95 confidence intervals which leads to the conclusion that it is a more reliable model for these particular datasets of wave heights obtained from satellite altimeter observations despite several authors considering evt models the gev and the gep like the ones that provide the most reliable estimates of high quantiles as the 100 year significant wave height figs 8 10 shows the reason why the maxent model should be used although the maxent has not been frequently used in the analysis of extreme wave heights obtained via satellite measurement on the basis of the presented results it could be concluded that maxent should be considered as an equally suitable method for the task or even more suitable than the competing gpd at least for this specific dataset specifically the maxent model appears to be very robust for the selection of the threshold levels which is a known weak point of the gpd model within the pot approach 5 conclusion in this work the performance of the maximum entropy model maxent is evaluated as appropriate for the prediction of high levels of return which is based on uniformity of the results obtained with the models maxent gpd and gev tested on nine data sets of hs obtained from satellite altimeter observations over the north atlantic ocean area for a time period of 20 years 1992 2012 furthermore it is argued that the maximum entropy model is suitable for the calculation of high return levels in comparison with the ml calculation using the generalised pareto distribution because the maximum entropy model shows to be more robust to variation in sample size that is variation of threshold value as shown in figs 8 10 acknowledgements this work was performed within the

section 4 2 methods for distribution functions a brief characterization of the proposed methods for prediction of distributional properties of extreme wave heights will be given firstly the maximum entropy method and afterwards an overview of gpd and gev as particular forms of extreme value theory 2 1 maximum entropy method maxent maximum entropy has been introduced within the field of thermodynamics but later on through statistical mechanics it gained popularity as a promising concept for inference processes in physical systems with limited data i e limited information about it this method has been recently used in a variety of scientific disciplines including in ocean engineering where it has been used as an important tool in long term prediction of wave height extremes e g dong et al 2013a petrov et al 2013 since long and reliable wave height records are not always available the authors were keen on testing the skills of maxent method for the extrapolation of extremes wave heights where the obtained probability distribution function would be characterized solely from the data obtained from the sample by using a set of statistical moments according to the principle of maximum entropy jaynes 1957 the probability distribution that maximizes information entropy while satisfying the available information constraints is arguably the best estimate i e the least biased distribution among all possible distributions that comply with given information constraints while being noncommittal to the missing information the maxent algorithm used in this work uses the algorithm of gotovac and gotovac 2009 which maximizes shannon s formulation of the information entropy shannon 1948 defined as 1 s f x m i n x m a x l n f x f x d x in which l n f x is the quantity of information and f the probability distribution function f d p as information constraints are given in the form of known statistical moments derived from the pot sample of significant wave heights the maxent model produces the least biased distribution by maximizing the entropy in order to derive the resulting distribution obtained by the maxent model one has to solve the next optimization problem 2a m a x s f forced to 2b x m i n x m a x h i x f x d x μ i i 0 m where the constraints are the statistical moments of the arbitrary basis functions h i x i 0 m a given optimization problem has been determined by transforming it from an unconstrained convex optimization problem by using the lagrangian function with the corresponding multipliers and adaptive romberg integration as demonstrated in berger et al 1996 an improved iterative scaling has been used as an optimization technique while opting for chebyshev polynomials instead of the classical monomials as a basis function contributed additionally to a more stable numerical algorithm as demonstrated in bandyopadhyay et al 2005 the resulting probability density function obtained with a given maxent algorithm is given as 3 f x e x p 1 j 0 m γ j t j x where m is the number of constraining moments γ j are lagrangian multipliers and t j x are chebyshev polynomials detailed presentation of the maxent algorithm along with the numerical procedure is given in gotovac and gotovac 2009 the original maxent algorithm of gotovac and gotovac 2009 has been customized here only in terms of normalizing the affiliating domain of the maxent s pdf in order to be suitable for pot samples of significant wave heights and therefore fully consistent with the competing gpd model as presented in petrov et al 2013 normalization of the maxent distributions domain has been obtained by setting arbitrarily the boundaries of the domain as x m i n x m a x prior to analyses the choice of the lower boundary is implicitly obvious x m μ as it is determined by the threshold value used in the particular pot sample on the other hand the upper boundary of the domain is subject to an arbitrary choice and reflects the asymptotic limit of the distribution in the right tail zone and therefore has to be carefully selected the selection procedure of x m a x is thoroughly discussed in the following section with a demonstration on available wave height data sets besides the arbitrary choice of domain boundaries the maxent model is constrained also by the number of sample moments m that are included in the analysis in this work the maxent model has been constrained with sample moments up to the fourth order increasing the number of moments m included in the formulation of the maxent model over arbitrarily selected up to fourth order m 4 would have an insignificant impact to resulting maxent s estimates of high return levels e g 100 year significant wave heights the accuracy of a given high quantile produced with the maximum entropy model constrained by up to the fourth order moment may be quantified with the last significant figure which takes the value of 10 2 for the estimates of the 100 year return level which is good enough for applications in the coastal and ocean engineering practice the return value x p associated to the p year return period t p is calculated by deriving the inverse of the maxent cumulative distribution with the corresponding probability 1 1 t p n y where n y is an average annual number of observations in a given pot sample furthermore the bootstrapping technique has been used to quantify the uncertainty of the maxent model the confidence interval for estimates of return values generated by the maximum entropy model was produced by using hundred bootstrap samples which were produced by resampling with replacement from original pot samples this approach is consistent with the mle estimators around the return values that were obtained with the models gpd or gev due to fact that maximum likelihood estimates are asymptotically normally distributed hosking and wallis 1987 2 2 extreme value theory evt methods according to petrov et al 2013 evt serves as an analogy to the central limit theorem clt the statistical behaviour of sample maxima m n m a x x 1 x n where x 1 x n is a sequence of independent random variables and can be characterized by one of three families of distributions gumbel fréchet and reverse weibull in the a m annual maxima method the h s measured in a regular time scale is represented by x which means that m n stands for maximum value over 1 year the statistical behaviour of annual maxima is described by a distribution that belongs to the generalized extreme value g e v family of distributions defined as 4 g x e x p 1 ξ x μ σ 1 ξ the distribution is defined on x 1 ξ x μ σ 0 where μ σ 0 ξ the generalized extreme value distribution gev is composed of three parameters μ which is the location parameter σ is the scale parameter and ξ is the shape parameter the gev model has finite ξ 0 or infinite ξ 0 upper end point depending on the shape parameter by inverting expression 4 it is possible to estimate the return values i e extreme quantiles associated with the return period t p 5 z p μ σ ξ 1 l o g 1 p ξ ξ 0 μ σ l o g l o g 1 p ξ 0 in which g z p 1 p the z p value it is expected to be exceeded once every 1 p years corresponding to the value of t p pot is also a possible method in the scope of extreme value theory it uses all the peaks that are above a certain threshold and not only the annual maxima the use of this method is motivated by the fact that annual maxima may be inappropriate if there is more data within each year of measurement record that can be classified as an extreme the peak over threshold method is based on the fact that like the annual maxima method it has an approximately gev distribution eqn 4 thus peaks above sufficiently high thresholds have the corresponding approximate distribution within the gpd family defined by 6 h y 1 1 ξ y σ 1 ξ in which y x u conditional on x u u is the threshold value the coherence that exists between the extreme value models as gev and gpd means that ξ ξ and σ σ ξ u μ can be related with the purpose of estimating the return levels it is necessary to specify first the exceedance rates of thresholds as λ p x u related to the gev parameters by 7 λ 1 e x p 1 n 1 ξ u μ σ 1 ξ so the mean crossing rate of any level x u is 8 λ 1 ξ x u σ 1 ξ placing expression 8 equal to 1 p the p year return level z p is obtained by 9 z p u σ ξ λ p ξ 1 the parameter estimation of gev and gpd models can be achieved by several techniques in this work the maximum likelihood methodology ml was adopted as described for example in coles 2001 furthermore there are other robust methods that also perform well as described in vandewalle 2004 and the probability weighted moments pwm and l moments pandey et al 2001 3 application of the models to the dataset satellite altimeter measurements of hs over the northern part of atlantic ocean over a period of 20 years 1992 2012 have been used the data were divided into 1 longitude x 1 latitude grid squares and the median along the satellite track was taken in each of them five grid points have been used to study long term extreme behaviour of significant wave heights with the location of the points marked in fig 1 3 1 gev model results the long term behaviour of the datasets was firstly represented by the gev model the gev distribution is fitted to samples of 20 annual maxima of hs medians for each of the selected grid points in fig 2 diagnostic plots for the dataset from grid point no 15 are presented showing return level plot histogram over layered with the distribution function the probability plot and the quantile plot the information provided by these plots indicates the goodness of fit coles 2001 the diagnostic plots of the remaining grid points are not presented since the gev model shows a similar level of agreement with data for all of them instead table 1 summarizes the obtained results presenting the gev parameters and the 100 year return level accompanied with corresponding 95 confidence intervals the value of the shape parameter and the corresponding 95 confidence interval indicate that the fitted gev model for the examined datasets does not exclude that the data follows the gumbel model pattern especially in the case of the most northern grid point point 3 leading possibly to an overestimation of the high return levels on the other side grid point 23 the one closest to the south has a negative value of the shape parameter including the 95 confidence interval leading to a short right tail of the distribution and therefore the smallest value of the 100 year return level estimate 3 2 gpd model results the first step in the pot model is to estimate the threshold range that is high enough to support the asymptotic basis for the gpd model and low enough in order to avoid high variance threshold range has been determined for each of the data sets by the means of graphical tools like the mean residual life plot and the plot that indicate the variation of models parameters depending on the threshold variation the selected threshold range is from 5 to 8 m for all grid points except for the grid point 23 which indicated some linearity of the parameters within the threshold range of 3 6 m additionally since it is known that at lower latitudes the extreme events are occurring far less often than at the higher latitudes the threshold level had to be lowered so as to include an acceptable number of data in the sample as for the gev model the diagnostic plots of the gpd model for the dataset from the grid point no 15 are presented in fig 3 showing return level plot histogram over layered with the distribution function probability plot and quantile plot the presented gpd model fits the pot sample of hs with the threshold level set at 7m quite well moreover a similar level of the agreement with the data is obtained across the whole threshold range and thus those plots are excluded furthermore the diagnostic plots for the rest of the grid points are also skipped here since the gpd model has a similar pattern and a similar level of goodness of fit as well in comparison with the presented grid point 15 to summarize the results obtained with the gpd model table 2 has been prepared which gives information about the size of the scrutinized satellite dataset i e the number of medians and size of the pot sample through the analysed threshold range following with the gpd predicted values of 100 year return level with the corresponding 95 confidence interval for each of them the obtained value of the shape parameter is very close to zero although it stays in the negative zone for all of the data sets except for the grid point 23 the accompanying 95 confidence interval is broad enough for any of the dataset plus threshold value combination leaving the question of the model s domain of attraction open i e weibull or gumbel when comparing the 100 year return levels obtained by the models gpd and gev the agreement is quite notable except for the grid point 23 with the lowest latitude value in the case of the dataset from the grid point 23 gpd model suggests that the gumbel model is the appropriate one leading to values of h s 100 y r roughly around 14m while the gev model indicates the reverse shape of the right tail strongly weibull model with the estimate of the h s 100 y r set at 12m the reason for these fundamentally different results could be the fact that the dataset observed at grid point 23 has very few extreme events and the smaller wave heights do not follow the same parent distribution as the higher or extreme wave heights 3 3 maxent model results in comparison with gpd and gev maxent has a different theoretical foundation i e it is a non parametric method the maxent method proved to be successful when estimating the extreme wave heights as presented in petrov et al 2013 the numerical process of maxent used in this work is defined on the finite domain so the maxent was used on the same pot samples by having the same range of threshold values as in the analysis with the gpd model employing maxent in pot samples legitimates the utilization of the truncated domain of the maxent model the lower boundary is fixed by the selected threshold and the upper boundary is chosen arbitrarily the upper bound has to be sufficiently high in order to produce a pdf that is not a truncated version of the real pdf in the right tail region due to the limited domain of the model still a very large upper limit of the model could lead to an artificially extended version of the real pdf and therefore would induce smoothing by testing the maxent model on domains that have lower boundary defined with the threshold value of the sample and a range of different upper boundaries the optimal value for the upper end point of the domain for the maxent model is selected fig 4 presents the estimates of 25 50 100 1000 and 10 000 year return levels obtained with the maxent employed on a dataset from the grid point 15 with the lower boundary at 7m and the upper boundary between 20m and 40m are shown the value 30m is adopted as an ideal value for the upper boundary of the maxent model domain since it can be noticed that it is a value for which higher quantiles became approximately constant before it once again starts to rise due to the extended domain the value 30m is adopted for all of the data sets since similar patterns are identified in those cases sample moments until the fourth order have been used as a constraint in the formulation of the maxents pdf the achieved accuracy of the obtained high quantiles i e 100 year return levels generated by the maxent model have value 10 2 to be the last significant figure being sufficient for practical engineering purposes including higher order moments into the formulation would have an insignificant difference to the accuracy of the adopted maxent model with moments up to the fourth order to give an insight of the sensitivity of the maxent model on the choice of m i e order of the sample moments constraints the estimates of 25 50 100 1000 and 10000 year return values obtained with the maxent model applied on the data from the grid point 15 are presented on the fig 5 with lower and upper boundary set on 7m and 30m respectively while varying number of moments used as constraints are between 2 and 6 to give an example how maxent model fits the data the return level plot and density plot are presented in fig 6 and fig 7 respectively for the maxent model applied to the data set from the grid point 15 with the threshold value set at 7m which can be directly compared with the gpd model which has been already presented previously on fig 3 the 95 confidence interval for maxent is produced by employing the model to 100 bootstrap samples generated from the original sample considering that the variation of bootstrap maxent estimates of the high return levels is normally distributed the 95 confidence interval was estimated the maxent model fits the data with a similar level of goodness of fit but at the same time have a significantly smaller envelope of uncertainty presented with the 95 confidence interval a similar pattern of smaller uncertainty gap for maxent model in comparison to the results obtained with the gpd has been identified and in other combinations of dataset and threshold value the above statement can be verified by comparing the summarized results of the maxent 100 year return levels along with 95 confidence intervals for all examined data sets presented in table 2 this robustness of the maxent to the sample size has been demonstrated also by petrov et al 2013 in general the results achieved by the maxent model correspond well with the ones obtained with gpd and gev models table 2 presents the results of the return levels for the maximum entropy point the bootstrap 95 confidence intervals with the bootstrap average of the return level estimates the bias estimated between the average of return levels obtained with maxent model employed on bootstrap samples and the return levels obtained with maxent model employed on original sample for each of the tested thresholds and datasets is relatively small that is the return levels estimated from the original samples fall within 95 confidence interval around the corresponding bootstrap means the comparison of the models maxent and gpd is shown in table 2 the maxent model exhibits greater stability and less variability than the competitive gpd model through the same threshold range for all datasets indicating reliable tail estimates with lower variability than gpd moreover if these high quantiles are compared also with the return levels produced with gev model as shown in table 1 it can be identified that there is a significant level of similarity between the gev gpd and maxent model 4 discussion in order to summarize the results of the extreme analysis obtained by employing the gev the gpd and the maxent model in samples of significant wave heights derived from the satellite altimeter observations figs 8 10 are obtained the left part of the figs 8 10 is presenting the variation of the 100 year return level along with corresponding 95 confidence interval produced with the gpd and maxent by fitting the pot samples while the right side of the figures is reserved for the gev model employed on am samples the pot and am approaches produce close estimates of high return levels of wave height except for the dataset from grid point 23 with the lowest latitude value where those two approaches give reverse suggestions about the right tail leading to estimates of h s 100 y r a p p 12m for gev model and h s 100 y r a p p 14m for the gpd and maxent further within the pot approach two competing models give similar values of high return values but with the distinctive difference in the uncertainty gap i e the size of the 95 confidence interval envelope across the whole threshold range and for all of the examined datasets i e grid points the maxent method produces smaller 95 confidence intervals which leads to the conclusion that it is a more reliable model for these particular datasets of wave heights obtained from satellite altimeter observations despite several authors considering evt models the gev and the gep like the ones that provide the most reliable estimates of high quantiles as the 100 year significant wave height figs 8 10 shows the reason why the maxent model should be used although the maxent has not been frequently used in the analysis of extreme wave heights obtained via satellite measurement on the basis of the presented results it could be concluded that maxent should be considered as an equally suitable method for the task or even more suitable than the competing gpd at least for this specific dataset specifically the maxent model appears to be very robust for the selection of the threshold levels which is a known weak point of the gpd model within the pot approach 5 conclusion in this work the performance of the maximum entropy model maxent is evaluated as appropriate for the prediction of high levels of return which is based on uniformity of the results obtained with the models maxent gpd and gev tested on nine data sets of hs obtained from satellite altimeter observations over the north atlantic ocean area for a time period of 20 years 1992 2012 furthermore it is argued that the maximum entropy model is suitable for the calculation of high return levels in comparison with the ml calculation using the generalised pareto distribution because the maximum entropy model shows to be more robust to variation in sample size that is variation of threshold value as shown in figs 8 10 acknowledgements this work was performed within the

22637,the seismic characteristics of liquid sloshing in partially filled sloped bottom tank are investigated numerically six different ground motions classified on the basis of low intermediate and high frequency contents are selected to determine the dynamic characteristics of liquid in sloped bottom tanks the effect of different slope angle on the frequency contents of earthquakes are investigated the liquid domain is discretized as the combination of three node triangular and four node quadrilateral finite elements the individual contribution of impulsive and convective response components of hydrodynamic behavior in terms of base shear force and hydrodynamic pressure distribution along the walls of the containers are successfully measured the efficacy of the developed numerical model is validated with the existing published results keywords sloped bottom tank earthquakes impulsive convective 1 introduction liquid containers are considered to be the inseparable amenities to society and industries free surface motion of liquid in partially filled liquid container is termed as sloshing liquid containers are used to store and transport variety of liquid ranging from potable water to hazardous chemicals or flammable fuels hence liquid containers can have any shape depending upon the requirements of liquid to be stored in sloshing in any partially filled liquid container due to any kind of external excitation impose hydrodynamic pressure along the periphery of the container which may lead to structural instability resulting either spillage of liquid or complete damages to the structure sloshing of liquid in containers or vessels moving on road and oceangoing or stable subjected to strong earthquakes or ocean waves are prone to damage hence it is of paramount concern to investigate the complex behavior of sloshing in different branches of engineering to maintain the safety and serviceability of the containers the amount of liquid participates in sloshing in fact determines the overall dynamics of sloshing and the participation of liquid in sloshing depend on some diverse parameters like shape of container amplitude and frequency of external excitation liquid depth and internal components if any etc hence it makes sloshing problems more intriguing to understand the complex behavior of liquid sloshing a good number of experimental studies have been performed pal et al 2000 bredmose et al 2003 akyildiz 2002 akyildiz et al 2013 akyildiz and unal 2005 panigrahy et al 2009 nayak and biswal 2015 park et al 2016 radnic et al 2018 however experimental investigation requires costly instruments and time consuming arrangements to achieve the desired output but it is not always suitable hence analytical solutions are developed to analyze the liquid sloshing in simple geometry tanks with uncomplicated boundary conditions housner 1963 abrahmson 1966 faltinsen 1978 2010 kim et al 1995 wu et al 2001 but these studies were limited to compute the free surface wave displacements only to overcome the shortcomings numerical techniques are employed to explore the dynamic traits of liquid sloshing finite difference method fdm chen and chiang 1999 chen and nokes 2005 wu et al 2012 wu and chen 2009 boundary element method bem faltinsen et al 2000 2010 chen et al 2007 boundary volume method isaacson and ryu 1999 to analyze the liquid sloshing in cylindrical and rectangular shape containers free vibration analysis of partially filled cylindrical tank was conducted using finite element method balendra et al 1982 to analyze the sloshing characteristics in an axis symmetric tank subjected to real earthquake ground motion the liquid domain was discretized into four node quadrilateral elements aslam 1981 the liquid structure interaction in tall and broad tank with both the flexible and rigid wall condition was investigated under earthquake ground motion using finite element method moreover the developed model was efficient enough to calculate the hydrodynamic pressure at different heights of the container liu and ma 1982 the free surface wave elevation and hydrodynamic pressure distribution along the walls of the three dimensional rectangular tank under harmonic ground motion was verified using finite element method wu et al 1998 linear and nonlinear sloshing in a rectangular tank under harmonic ground motion was investigated using finite element method and the study revealed that non linearity of surface waves have no significant effect on pressure distribution along its walls virella et al 2008 the sloshing characteristics were verified considering the compressibility of liquid using finite element method and it was observed that compressibility possesses a specific effect on liquid sloshing in a rectangular tank with flexible walls whereas hardly any influence was marked with rigid tank walls mitra and sinhamahapatra 2008 sloshing of liquid in a partially filled liquid container subjected to arbitrary ground motion was investigated using finite element method and the study was efficient enough to compute the impulsive and convective component of sloshing characteristics pandit and biswal 2018 however the studies reported above were carried out without inclusion of any internal components like blocks baffles though submerged components sometimes remained an integral part of liquid container attempts have been made to reduce the impact of hydrodynamic pressure along the walls of the containers hence a numerical model was developed to understand the effect of different size blocks and baffles on sloshing characteristics in a rectangular tank choun and yun 1996 the effect of rigid baffles on sloshing characteristics were examined when partially filled cylindrical container was subjected to earthquake ground motion using boundary element method gedikli and erguven 1999 the free and force vibration analysis of partially filled cylindrical tanks with flexible and rigid circular baffles were analyzed using finite element method biswal et al 2003 2010 effect of submerged block in a rectangular tank under real earthquake ground motion was verified using pressure based finite element method mitra and sinhamahapatra 2007 further effect of horizontal and vertical baffles in rectangular tank under arbitrary ground motion was examined using finite element method arafa 2007 experimental investigations were carried out to check the efficiency of vertically placed submerged block and horizontal orientation of perforated plate in reducing the hydrodynamic pressure distribution on the walls of the square and rectangular tank under harmonic ground motions jin et al 2014 nayak and biswal 2015 effectiveness of four different types of baffles in suppressing the pressure was investigated experimentally when sloshing occurred in partially filled rectangular tank and it was observed that not only excitation frequency but also the location and configuration of baffles played an important role xue et al 2017 much of works have been carried out extensively to explore the sloshing behavior in rectangular cylindrical and square tanks with and without baffles but it is always a great importance to study the sloshing behavior in complicated shape liquid containers as it is well known that the dynamic sloshing characteristics varies if the geometrical shape of container changes for clear understanding about the sloshing phenomena dynamic slosh characteristics in arbitrary shape container were evaluated under a real earthquake ground motion mitra and sinhamahapatra 2008 additionally a set of experimental investigation was accomplished to understand the behavior of 300 sloped bottom liquid tank with different liquid depth gardarsson et al 2001 sloshing energy dissipated along the inclined walls of the container which was the crucial findings of this study the fundamental sloshing frequency of liquid in various shape aqueducts e g trapezoidal shape v shape elliptical arc shaped were determined using an approximate analytical technique li and wang 2014 finite element method was adopted to calculate the normalized sloshing frequency effective mass and damping ratio constant of flat bottom chamfered bottom box and ramped bottom tanks with variable liquid depth where the liquid domain was discretized as three node triangular elements and the study didn t count for the pressure developed during the sloshing love and tait 2014 hence the primary aim of the present investigation is to explore the dynamic characteristics of liquid sloshing in sloped bottom liquid tank under six different real earthquake ground motion categorized on the basis of low intermediate and high frequency content even though numerous attempts are made to analyze the sloshing characteristics in flat bottom or cylindrical tank the analysis of sloshing in sloped bottom container is of practical importance three node triangular and four node quadrilateral finite elements are comprised to discretize the liquid domain and compute the sloshing in various slope tanks with velocity potential as the only nodal degree of freedom a finite element code is developed in matlab and the efficiency of the code is verified by comparing the results with the published results the developed numerical model is capable of quantifying the impulsive and convective components of base shear force base moment and hydrodynamic pressure distribution along the walls of the containers not reported in earlier studies of sloped bottom tank analysis 2 mathematical formulation a schematic diagram of problem geometry is shown in fig 1 2 d cartesian co ordinate system is used to define the computational domain inside the tank such that the origin o is at the mid point of the free surface x axis along the direction of free surface and z axis pointing vertically upward the symbols bs btb and bb denote the liquid free surface the side wall of the tank and tank bottom respectively the liquid considered is inviscid incompressible and ir rotational the tank walls are assumed to be rigid so that there should be no elastic interaction between the walls and liquid the governing equation for the motion of liquid in terms of velocity potential x z t is expressed by laplace equation where 2 2 2 x 2 2 z 2 the free surface

where n n x i n z j is the unit normal vector the impulsive component of hydrodynamic pressure can be obtained by neglecting the liquid sloshing as a result of which the pressure at the free liquid

to check the efficiency of the present numerical method the results of fundamental sloshing frequencies are verified with experimental results eigen value problem is solved to find out the fundamental sloshing frequency in sloped bottom container fig 3 presents the variation in fundamental sloshing frequency of sloped bottom tld with the ratio of horizontal distance over sloped surface to entire

the obtained result is found to have good agreement with the published results hence the present model can be implemented to evaluate the dynamic properties of liquid in various sloped bottom tank under real earthquake ground motion slosh displacement in partially filled rectangular tank under harmonic ground motion is evaluated and the results are superimposed with the published results xue and lin 2011 employed finite difference method to find out the slosh displacement in partially filled rectangular tank under different excitation frequencies the length l of the tank is taken as 0 57 m and liquid depth h is considered to be 0 15 m the tank is applied to an excitation of velocity function of v a ω c o s w t where the amplitude of excitation a 0 005 m and ω is the excitation frequency the fundamental sloshing frequency ω 0 is found to be 6 057 rad s fig 5 presents the temporal variation of free surface slosh amplitude measured at the left and right wall of the container and a great similarity is observed between the published results and the results obtained using present method thus proves the validity of the present method 3 2 definition of ground motion the details of the six different ground motions are presented in table 1 for the comparison purpose the pgas of selected data are scaled to a fixed magnitude of 0 2 g as shown in fig 6 near e coast of honshu and lower earthquake are considered as low frequency content pga pgv 0 8 kern county and imperial valley earthquake are regarded as intermediate frequency content 0 8 pga pgv 1 2 san fernando and central honshu are categorized as high frequency content pga 1 2 ground motion 3 3 sloshing frequency the effect of different slope angle on the fundamental sloshing frequency are evaluated and are presented in table 2 eigen value problem is solved to determine the fundamental sloshing frequency in sloped bottom tank the width of the tank is considered to be unity out of page the effect of different bottom length on fundamental sloshing frequency for a particular slope angle are measured and listed in table 3 the fundamental sloshing frequency is found to decrease with increase in bottom length lb even though slope remains constant the width of the tank is assumed to be unity out of page 3 4 sloshing response the sloshing waves provide the overall dynamics which means it gives the convective component of hydrodynamic pressure and resulting base shear determination of slosh wave under earthquake ground motion can be considered to be an important investigation so that spillage can be avoided providing sufficient free board hence the sloshing response of liquid in different sloped bottom container is studied figs 7 9 presents the temporal variation of free surface wave displacements under low intermediate and high frequency content earthquake ground motion respectively measured from the free surface the slosh wave displacements are found weak during the initial duration of low frequency content near e coast of honshu earthquake because the pga occurs at the instant of 44 8s the slosh wave displacement are found to be significant after the instant of pga the absolute maximum magnitude of slosh displacements for the selected earthquakes are measure and presented in table 4 higher sloshing responses are observed in case of low frequency ground motion of near e coast of honshu and lower earthquake for 300 sloped bottom tank and intermediate frequency ground motion of imperial valley earthquake for 400 sloped bottom tank it is because one of the dominating frequency of imperial valley earthquake is found to very close to the fundamental sloshing frequency of liquid in 400 sloped bottom tank it is worth mentioning that slosh responses are found to be less sensitive for all the orientation of sloped bottom tank under high frequency content earthquake ground motion so the frequency content and dominating frequencies of the earthquakes plays important role during the calculation of sloshing response however 300 sloped bottom tank is found to suppress the slosh wave displacement under intermediate and high frequency content central honshu earthquake it is worth mentioning that slosh displacement reduces when the steepness of the wall reduces pandit and biswal 2019 the ground motions selected for this investigation are irrespective of considering the dominant frequencies of the earthquakes due to the uneven distribution of dominant frequencies in a particular earthquake ground motion the dynamic response of sloped bottom tank becomes highly unpredictable the slosh wave displacements with varying bottom length lb for particular slope is presented in table 5 increase in bottom length lb reduces the sloshing response in case of san fernando central honshu earthquake ground motion of high frequency content and lower earthquake of low frequency ground motion for all the orientation of sloped bottom tank the primary concern to study the effect of different bottom length is to reduce the slosh response by increasing the bottom length of the sloped bottom container however change of bottom length significantly changes the fundamental sloshing of liquid thus chaotic sloshing behavior is observed under certain earthquake ground motion 3 5 hydrodynamic base shear force evaluation of base shear force at tank bottom determines the maximum expected lateral force occur due to the earthquake excitation in the present study the base shear force due to hydrodynamic pressure is calculated and the study is further carried out to quantify the impulsive and convective components of slosh response during the excitation of the liquid container some amount of liquid participates in sloshing which is categorized as the convective component of liquid sloshing no study has been able to quantify the impulsive and convective response components for sloped bottom tanks the hydrodynamic base shear force can be directly evaluated using eq 17 the impulsive pressure can be calculated by restraining the liquid sloshing that means the pressure at free surface vanishes the temporal variation in hydrodynamic base shear force due to low intermediate and high frequency content earthquake ground motions are shown in figs 10 12 comparison between the impulsive and convective components of hydro dynamic base shear force along the duration of earthquake excitations are exhibited in figs 13 15 the absolute maximum hydrodynamic base shear the impulsive and convective components are listed in table 6 at the beginning of earthquake excitation when the sloshing was weak in case of high frequency content central honshu earthquake the impulsive component of hydrodynamic base shear dominates the convective components but when it propagates further the impulsive and convective components are found to have nearly equal effects for 300 and 400 sloped bottom tank however the convective components dominates the impulsive components for 500 sloped bottom tank determination of impulsive and convective components leads to a better design prospectus for the liquid container in case of central honshu earthquake ground motion the impulsive components dominated convective for 300 and 500 sloped tank and under san fernando earthquake ground motion impulsive components dominated convective components for 400 and 500 sloped tank however the convective components dominates the impulsive components in remaining cases the variation of impulsive and convective components of hydrodynamic base shear force at the base of the sloped bottom tank with varying the base length is investigated and the observed results are listed in table 7 the total hydrodynamic base shear force increases with increase in bottom length lb for 300 sloped bottom tank under high frequency content earthquake ground motion near e coast of honshu earthquake of low frequency content and imperial valley of intermediate frequency content earthquake ground motion in case of 400 and 500 sloped bottom tank under high frequency content earthquake ground motion near e coast of honshu of low frequency content and kern county of intermediate frequency content earthquake ground motion the total hydrodynamic base shear force decreases with increase in bottom length it can be observed from table 7 that there is reduction in impulsive and convective components of base shear force for 300 sloped bottom tank under low frequency content and high frequency content earthquake ground motion for 400 sloped bottom tank the impulsive base shear force increases with increase in bottom length under low frequency content and imperial valley of intermediate frequency content earthquake ground motion however the convective components reduces under high frequency content near e coast of honshu of low frequency and kern county of intermediate frequency content earthquake ground motion with increase in bottom length of the sloped bottom container the impulsive component of hydrodynamic base shear force increase with increase in bottom length of the container under lower and imperial valley earthquake ground motion and the impulsive component decreases in the remaining cases however the convective component increases under san fernando earthquake ground motion as well 3 6 base moment investigation of overturning base moment due to the sloshing at the base of the container is an important parameter for the design consideration however a comparison is made between the impulsive and convective components of overturning base moment in this section for sloped bottom tanks fig 16 shows the variation in absolute maximum values of impulsive and convective components of overturning base moment for sloped bottom tanks with constant bottom length lb 0 09 m fig 16 a describes the absolute maximum value of overturning base moment in case of 300 sloped bottom tank the maximum response can be seen from low frequency content earthquake ground motion where as in case of 400 sloped bottom tank maximum response occurs at intermediate frequency content imperial valley earthquake ground motion and both the intermediate frequency content earthquake ground motion found to generate higher value of maximum base moment when subjected to 500 sloped bottom tank with bottom length 0 09 m increase in bottom length doesn t ensure the reduction of overturning moment when subjected to wide range of earthquake ground motion for the same amount of liquid assumed in this investigate for all the orientation for sloped bottom tank the response also varies unevenly however this investigation helps in designing the container provided with the quantification of impulsive and convective components of dynamic responses fig 17 presents the effect of overturning base moment when the bottom length of the sloped bottom container is changed 3 7 pressure distribution on tank wall the pressure distribution along the walls of the containers at the instance of pga is evaluated the distribution of total hydrodynamic pressure impulsive and convective components of pressure along the walls of sloped bottom tank subjected to the wide range of earthquake ground motion are shown in figs 18 20 higher magnitude of dynamic response can be expected at the instance of pga hence the pressure distribution at different heights of the tank walls are obtained from the design point of view determination of higher response leads to provide the maximum permissible limit of hydrodynamic pressure for the liquid tank when sloshing occurs without failure in case of fig 19 a the impulsive component of pressure distribution is found to negligible whereas the convective pressure is almost equal to total pressure from fig 18 it can be observed that the maximum pressure generated for all the sloped bottom tank with fixed bottom length when subjected to the low frequency content earthquake ground motion selected for this investigation 4 conclusions a velocity potential based 2d model is developed to determine the sloshing characteristics in sloped bottom tank subjected to variety of recorded earthquake ground motion finite element code in matlab environment based on galerkin weighted residual is developed the earthquakes are normalized to 0 2 g for the convenience and are selected unbiasedly without finding the dominant frequencies however the different orientation of sloped bottom tank changes the sloshing frequencies and are compared with previously published experimental results the efficiency of the present model is also verified by comparing the results of available flat bottom tanks so it can be concluded that the model can be efficient to analyze sloshing characteristics in arbitrary shape containers when under harmonic or random excitation the whole liquid domain is discretized as combination of three node triangular and four node quadrilateral elements the evaluation of impulsive and convective components of dynamic traits of liquid sloshing definitely provide a better insight for tank design the investigation is carried out for steeper sloped bottom tank and varying the bottom length of the container which were not focused in the previously published experimental and numerical study change in slope angle changes the sloshing response significantly however steeper slopes are found to be less effective in reducing the sloshing characteristics under earthquake ground motion convective response depicts the higher participation of liquid during the sloshing which is an advantage for tuned liquid damper tld so sloped bottom tank can be used as potential tld since the wave energy dissipate along the inclined shores of the beach increase in bottom length and available inclined run up reduces the sloshing response hence this parameters acts as passive wave damper to reduce the impact of sloshing and can maintain the stability and integrity of liquid retaining structure tank dimensions influence the sloshing characteristics and significant variation in impulsive and convective components are observed 
22637,the seismic characteristics of liquid sloshing in partially filled sloped bottom tank are investigated numerically six different ground motions classified on the basis of low intermediate and high frequency contents are selected to determine the dynamic characteristics of liquid in sloped bottom tanks the effect of different slope angle on the frequency contents of earthquakes are investigated the liquid domain is discretized as the combination of three node triangular and four node quadrilateral finite elements the individual contribution of impulsive and convective response components of hydrodynamic behavior in terms of base shear force and hydrodynamic pressure distribution along the walls of the containers are successfully measured the efficacy of the developed numerical model is validated with the existing published results keywords sloped bottom tank earthquakes impulsive convective 1 introduction liquid containers are considered to be the inseparable amenities to society and industries free surface motion of liquid in partially filled liquid container is termed as sloshing liquid containers are used to store and transport variety of liquid ranging from potable water to hazardous chemicals or flammable fuels hence liquid containers can have any shape depending upon the requirements of liquid to be stored in sloshing in any partially filled liquid container due to any kind of external excitation impose hydrodynamic pressure along the periphery of the container which may lead to structural instability resulting either spillage of liquid or complete damages to the structure sloshing of liquid in containers or vessels moving on road and oceangoing or stable subjected to strong earthquakes or ocean waves are prone to damage hence it is of paramount concern to investigate the complex behavior of sloshing in different branches of engineering to maintain the safety and serviceability of the containers the amount of liquid participates in sloshing in fact determines the overall dynamics of sloshing and the participation of liquid in sloshing depend on some diverse parameters like shape of container amplitude and frequency of external excitation liquid depth and internal components if any etc hence it makes sloshing problems more intriguing to understand the complex behavior of liquid sloshing a good number of experimental studies have been performed pal et al 2000 bredmose et al 2003 akyildiz 2002 akyildiz et al 2013 akyildiz and unal 2005 panigrahy et al 2009 nayak and biswal 2015 park et al 2016 radnic et al 2018 however experimental investigation requires costly instruments and time consuming arrangements to achieve the desired output but it is not always suitable hence analytical solutions are developed to analyze the liquid sloshing in simple geometry tanks with uncomplicated boundary conditions housner 1963 abrahmson 1966 faltinsen 1978 2010 kim et al 1995 wu et al 2001 but these studies were limited to compute the free surface wave displacements only to overcome the shortcomings numerical techniques are employed to explore the dynamic traits of liquid sloshing finite difference method fdm chen and chiang 1999 chen and nokes 2005 wu et al 2012 wu and chen 2009 boundary element method bem faltinsen et al 2000 2010 chen et al 2007 boundary volume method isaacson and ryu 1999 to analyze the liquid sloshing in cylindrical and rectangular shape containers free vibration analysis of partially filled cylindrical tank was conducted using finite element method balendra et al 1982 to analyze the sloshing characteristics in an axis symmetric tank subjected to real earthquake ground motion the liquid domain was discretized into four node quadrilateral elements aslam 1981 the liquid structure interaction in tall and broad tank with both the flexible and rigid wall condition was investigated under earthquake ground motion using finite element method moreover the developed model was efficient enough to calculate the hydrodynamic pressure at different heights of the container liu and ma 1982 the free surface wave elevation and hydrodynamic pressure distribution along the walls of the three dimensional rectangular tank under harmonic ground motion was verified using finite element method wu et al 1998 linear and nonlinear sloshing in a rectangular tank under harmonic ground motion was investigated using finite element method and the study revealed that non linearity of surface waves have no significant effect on pressure distribution along its walls virella et al 2008 the sloshing characteristics were verified considering the compressibility of liquid using finite element method and it was observed that compressibility possesses a specific effect on liquid sloshing in a rectangular tank with flexible walls whereas hardly any influence was marked with rigid tank walls mitra and sinhamahapatra 2008 sloshing of liquid in a partially filled liquid container subjected to arbitrary ground motion was investigated using finite element method and the study was efficient enough to compute the impulsive and convective component of sloshing characteristics pandit and biswal 2018 however the studies reported above were carried out without inclusion of any internal components like blocks baffles though submerged components sometimes remained an integral part of liquid container attempts have been made to reduce the impact of hydrodynamic pressure along the walls of the containers hence a numerical model was developed to understand the effect of different size blocks and baffles on sloshing characteristics in a rectangular tank choun and yun 1996 the effect of rigid baffles on sloshing characteristics were examined when partially filled cylindrical container was subjected to earthquake ground motion using boundary element method gedikli and erguven 1999 the free and force vibration analysis of partially filled cylindrical tanks with flexible and rigid circular baffles were analyzed using finite element method biswal et al 2003 2010 effect of submerged block in a rectangular tank under real earthquake ground motion was verified using pressure based finite element method mitra and sinhamahapatra 2007 further effect of horizontal and vertical baffles in rectangular tank under arbitrary ground motion was examined using finite element method arafa 2007 experimental investigations were carried out to check the efficiency of vertically placed submerged block and horizontal orientation of perforated plate in reducing the hydrodynamic pressure distribution on the walls of the square and rectangular tank under harmonic ground motions jin et al 2014 nayak and biswal 2015 effectiveness of four different types of baffles in suppressing the pressure was investigated experimentally when sloshing occurred in partially filled rectangular tank and it was observed that not only excitation frequency but also the location and configuration of baffles played an important role xue et al 2017 much of works have been carried out extensively to explore the sloshing behavior in rectangular cylindrical and square tanks with and without baffles but it is always a great importance to study the sloshing behavior in complicated shape liquid containers as it is well known that the dynamic sloshing characteristics varies if the geometrical shape of container changes for clear understanding about the sloshing phenomena dynamic slosh characteristics in arbitrary shape container were evaluated under a real earthquake ground motion mitra and sinhamahapatra 2008 additionally a set of experimental investigation was accomplished to understand the behavior of 300 sloped bottom liquid tank with different liquid depth gardarsson et al 2001 sloshing energy dissipated along the inclined walls of the container which was the crucial findings of this study the fundamental sloshing frequency of liquid in various shape aqueducts e g trapezoidal shape v shape elliptical arc shaped were determined using an approximate analytical technique li and wang 2014 finite element method was adopted to calculate the normalized sloshing frequency effective mass and damping ratio constant of flat bottom chamfered bottom box and ramped bottom tanks with variable liquid depth where the liquid domain was discretized as three node triangular elements and the study didn t count for the pressure developed during the sloshing love and tait 2014 hence the primary aim of the present investigation is to explore the dynamic characteristics of liquid sloshing in sloped bottom liquid tank under six different real earthquake ground motion categorized on the basis of low intermediate and high frequency content even though numerous attempts are made to analyze the sloshing characteristics in flat bottom or cylindrical tank the analysis of sloshing in sloped bottom container is of practical importance three node triangular and four node quadrilateral finite elements are comprised to discretize the liquid domain and compute the sloshing in various slope tanks with velocity potential as the only nodal degree of freedom a finite element code is developed in matlab and the efficiency of the code is verified by comparing the results with the published results the developed numerical model is capable of quantifying the impulsive and convective components of base shear force base moment and hydrodynamic pressure distribution along the walls of the containers not reported in earlier studies of sloped bottom tank analysis 2 mathematical formulation a schematic diagram of problem geometry is shown in fig 1 2 d cartesian co ordinate system is used to define the computational domain inside the tank

where n n x i n z j is the unit normal vector the impulsive component of hydrodynamic pressure can be obtained by neglecting the liquid sloshing as a result of which the pressure at the free liquid

investigate for all the orientation for sloped bottom tank the response also varies unevenly however this investigation helps in designing the container provided with the quantification of impulsive and convective components of dynamic responses fig 17 presents the effect of overturning base moment when the bottom length of the sloped bottom container is changed 3 7 pressure distribution on tank wall the pressure distribution along the walls of the containers at the instance of pga is evaluated the distribution of total hydrodynamic pressure impulsive and convective components of pressure along the walls of sloped bottom tank subjected to the wide range of earthquake ground motion are shown in figs 18 20 higher magnitude of dynamic response can be expected at the instance of pga hence the pressure distribution at different heights of the tank walls are obtained from the design point of view determination of higher response leads to provide the maximum permissible limit of hydrodynamic pressure for the liquid tank when sloshing occurs without failure in case of fig 19 a the impulsive component of pressure distribution is found to negligible whereas the convective pressure is almost equal to total pressure from fig 18 it can be observed that the maximum pressure generated for all the sloped bottom tank with fixed bottom length when subjected to the low frequency content earthquake ground motion selected for this investigation 4 conclusions a velocity potential based 2d model is developed to determine the sloshing characteristics in sloped bottom tank subjected to variety of recorded earthquake ground motion finite element code in matlab environment based on galerkin weighted residual is developed the earthquakes are normalized to 0 2 g for the convenience and are selected unbiasedly without finding the dominant frequencies however the different orientation of sloped bottom tank changes the sloshing frequencies and are compared with previously published experimental results the efficiency of the present model is also verified by comparing the results of available flat bottom tanks so it can be concluded that the model can be efficient to analyze sloshing characteristics in arbitrary shape containers when under harmonic or random excitation the whole liquid domain is discretized as combination of three node triangular and four node quadrilateral elements the evaluation of impulsive and convective components of dynamic traits of liquid sloshing definitely provide a better insight for tank design the investigation is carried out for steeper sloped bottom tank and varying the bottom length of the container which were not focused in the previously published experimental and numerical study change in slope angle changes the sloshing response significantly however steeper slopes are found to be less effective in reducing the sloshing characteristics under earthquake ground motion convective response depicts the higher participation of liquid during the sloshing which is an advantage for tuned liquid damper tld so sloped bottom tank can be used as potential tld since the wave energy dissipate along the inclined shores of the beach increase in bottom length and available inclined run up reduces the sloshing response hence this parameters acts as passive wave damper to reduce the impact of sloshing and can maintain the stability and integrity of liquid retaining structure tank dimensions influence the sloshing characteristics and significant variation in impulsive and convective components are observed 
22638,this research provides an analysis framework for offshore wind turbine owt support structures subjected to seismic wind and wave loads using the finite element method with soil structure interaction and a conservative soil liquefaction analysis is developed the nrel 5 mw jacket type owt under iec 61400 3 is analyzed the results indicate that seismic loads combined with wind and wave loads during power production often control the design especially near the rated wind speed for earthquakes with a peak ground acceleration pga smaller than 0 32 g and the dominant period t s smaller than 1 s the increase in steel weight due to seismic loads is small because the amplification of the seismic loads is not obvious for pga over 0 52 g almost all the members are controlled by the seismic loads and the increase in the steel design weight can be over 40 this paper also indicates that first mode tuned mass dampers for jacket type support structure with deep piles are efficient to reduce the vibration coupled from wind wave and seismic loads even with 20 m soil liquefaction keywords earthquake finite element analysis peak ground acceleration offshore wind turbine soil structure interaction steel structure optimal design 1 introduction offshore wind turbines owts play an important role in the field of renewable energy and they can sustain major loads from wind and waves however due to the fact that increasing numbers of owts are being constructed in earthquake zones seismic analysis of their responses during earthquakes has become increasingly important in the literature only a few studies have been conducted addressing this topic hence we will briefly mention those investigations that can be found in the literature and then discuss the difference of the current study from others in the end of this section several studies have emphasized the importance of the foundation and soil haciefendioglu 2012 conducted a response analysis of wind turbines subjected to stochastic excitation using a three dimensional 3d finite element model the results showed that the soil structure interaction ssi affects the behavior of wind turbines in a seismic situation harte et al 2014 showed the seismic response of an onshore wind turbine using a multi degree of freedom model and the results indicated that ssi may significantly affect the modal frequency of a turbine structure zhang et al 2014a b developed a structural design for a large scale pre stressed concrete bucket foundation for owts with seismic loads and their simulation results showed that the foundation can improve resistance to soil liquefaction during earthquakes alati et al 2015 investigated the seismic response of tripod and jacket foundations using fully coupled nonlinear time domain simulations and found that the earthquake loading may cause a significant increase in resultant stress demands mardfekri and gardoni 2015 developed a framework to assess the structural performance of owts subjected to extreme wind speeds and earthquake ground motions using 3d finite element model they indicated that the foundation type and soil conditions must be considered in the seismic zone anastasopoulos and theofilou 2016 investigated a hybrid foundation for owts a detailed comparison was performed between the hybrid foundation and a monopile type foundation they concluded that the hybrid foundation had an advantage related to buckling prevention and lateral resistance in earthquake situations santangelo et al 2018 performed the time domain uncoupled analysis under seismic and environmental loads for owts and investigated pertinent levels of aerodynamic damping there have been some studies using centrifuge or shaking table tests to simulate the behavior of support structures yu et al 2015 investigated the seismic response of gravity and monopile foundations using earthquake centrifuge tests they found that the different foundations exhibited quite different behavior seong et al 2017 used centrifuge modeling and the finite element method to evaluate the natural frequency of owts a centrifuge test can be used to verify and calibrate simplified estimations of ssi on owts prowell et al 2014 conducted shaking table tests to estimate the structural response and compared the results with the fast jonkman and buhl 2005 simulation this research provided useful insights into seismic responses for design load cases involving combined wind and earthquake loads ssi for owts under seismic loads has been studied by some researchers ku and chien 2016 presented a numerical model of an owt jacket foundation subjected to seismic loading and proposed a procedure to design owt foundation piles under different soil conditions santangelo et al 2016 investigated owts subjected to different earthquake records and compared the results with fully coupled simulations they proposed a time domain uncoupled analysis implementation for seismic assessment of wind turbines under operating conditions where the nonlinear foundation behavior was included wang et al 2017 performed the numerical analysis of the owt support structure under seismic wind and sea loads while the results indicated that the interaction of earthquake wind wave and current loads should be taken into account austin and jerath 2017 studied the ssi effect on the seismic response of specific wind turbines with different types of foundation using the finite element method they indicated that the ssi effect on the seismic response of wind turbine is not significant huo et al 2018 discussed the seismic response of wind turbine towers with long period ground motions when ssi was considered and the result was compared to the value induced by the bedrock wave kjørlaug and kaynia 2015 performed a finite element analysis of a wind turbine under seismic excitation with ssi and the vertical earthquake was considered as a critical load in the design vatanchian and shooshtari 2018 investigated the seismic response of a wind turbine with ssi and concluded that the effect of ssi is detrimental for turbine in operating condition some analytical approaches were proposed to evaluate the performance of support structures under seismic loads using the fragility analysis mo et al 2017 performed the seismic fragility analysis of a monopile owt and the fragility curves were plotted to assess the probability of exceeding different damage states patil et al 2016 investigated the structural performance of wind turbine tower under strong ground motion through seismic fragility analysis and the foundation overturning was found to be the most critical condition asareh et al 2016 analyzed the 5 mw nrel wind turbine considering different earthquakes and wind intensities using a finite element model while the fragility analysis of the structure was performed on the design of wind turbines yuan et al 2017 studied the fragility of the large scale owt under the combination of seismic and aerodynamic loads by push over analyses and the result showed that the owt subjected to the load combination in normal operation condition is safer than in the parked condition to mitigate the dynamic response of owts some studies proposed to install control device at the top of the tower zuo et al 2017 used multiple tune mass dampers mtmds to control vibration from fundamental and higher modes under multiple hazards while using smaller mtmds can significantly improve the robustness of the control system and facilitate the installations hussan et al 2018 investigated that mtmds installed at the top and base of the turbine tower and from his research the performance of mtmds seems to be prominent in suppressing the first two vibrational modes yang et al 2018 developed and applied a numerical analysis framework compared with the prediction calculated by other numerical methods the soil liquefaction can cause soil settlement in seismic region so it is important to take liquefaction into account in owt design zhang et al 2014a b performed the analysis of composite bucket foundation to prevent soil liquefaction and the foundation provides a good resistance to soil liquefaction during the earthquake beside of external loading environmental conditions and ssi effect some researches discussed the effect of turbine tower structure and material with different conditions sadowski et al 2017 conducted the analysis of a wind turbine tower with weld imperfections which was found to have a significant effect on the intensities of ground accelerations vassiliou et al 2015 studied the behavior of the top heavy cantilever column on a rigid support surface and the overturning stability of the model on large excitation was not effected by its deformability alamo et al 2018 studied the ssi effects on the superstructures of owts and yielded the conclusion that the profile of superficial layer of soil is important to the estimation of the owt system fundamental frequency and damping katsanos et al 2016 presented a comprehensive review on the researches relative to seismic analysis and design of wind turbines and the key factors for wind turbine s seismic performance is discussed beside of environmental load conditions structural vibration could shorten fatigue life of owts jin et al 2018 built a dynamic model optimizing tuned mass damper tmd parameters to mitigate the structural vibration and the effect of fatigue the above references studied the owt structural behavior using the seismic analysis without the effect of soil liquefaction however in sandy seabed it is almost impossible to avoid soil liquefaction under a strong earthquake in this study the nrel 5 mw jacket type owt was used in the seismic regions while the 3d finite element analysis and steel design with the ssi under the dead wind wave current and seismic loads were performed according to iec 61400 3 2009 and api design code 1997 moreover a conservative scheme was used to estimate the liquefaction effect during earthquakes while the first mode tuned mass damper for the reduction of structural vibration was investigated with and without soil liquefaction 2 a seismic analysis and design scheme for owt support structures to analyze the responses of owt support structures subjected to seismic loads the geological conditions of the wind farm site the seismic response spectrum and the soil structure interaction ssi must take into account this study uses the newmark direct integration method to perform the time history finite element analysis and the api steel design is then used to find the optimal member thickness in the finite element model beam elements are used to simulate the superstructure and piles while nonlinear p y t z and q z elements based on the api specification are used to simulate the soil behavior the soil profile can contain a number of layers with different soil properties and the stiffness matrixes of p y t z and q z curve elements as shown in fig 1 are generated according to the displacement field of the current time step the newton raphson method is finally used to solve this nonlinear matrix equation while about two to five iterations are used to obtain a convergent solution the procedures shown in fig 1 are illustrated as follows 1 the material properties of the soil at each layer should be known and the seismic response spectrum needs to be obtained at a certain soil layer while that at the sea bed is used in this paper 2 using the response spectrum and the peak ground acceleration pga we adopt the simqke program 1976 to generate the three direction seismic accelerations of the artificial earthquake in the time domain three different groups of the three direction artificial earthquakes will be generated using three different random values in the simqke program 3 the shake 91 1993 program is used to generate the acceleration field in each soil layer while the known acceleration field at a certain layer the soil surface used in this paper as mentioned in 2 is the input data the acceleration fields are then integrated to the displacement fields and at each soil layer the displacement field is applied to one end of the p y t z and q z only at the soil layer of the pile bottom while the other end is connected to the pile 4 in the finite element analysis the static analysis under the dead load is performed initially and the time history newmark direct integration analysis is performed under the coupling of seismic wind and wave loads when the tubular member is submerged into the water level the circular area of the member multiplied by the water mass density is set to the additional mass per length for this beam element 5 in the dynamic analysis under a loading case at each time step each beam member contains 12 strength components including axial forces shear forces torsions and moments at the two ends of the beam we select the 24 groups of the beam 12 strength components using the maximum and minimum values from all the load and time steps for example a group is due to the maximum torsion at the right beam node and other strengths of this group such as axial forces moments and shear forces are obtained at the same time step of the maximum torsion thus the 12 strength components of each group are simultaneous one of which is the extreme value of all the loads and time steps 6 the steel design of a beam element is performed according to the api rp 2a lrfd code using the 24 group beam strengths for each loading case the section diameter of a beam element is set to be constant and the design program is used to find the maximum design thickness under all loading cases the thickness of the next design cycle is then determined from this maximum design thickness for each beam element 7 the next optimal analysis and design cycle begin using the member thicknesses of the last analysis and design cycle until the variations in thickness of all the sections are small the procedures stop in this study seven analysis and design cycles are enough to obtain the stable final design section dimensions an important issue is that soil liquefaction may occur due to earthquakes in a sandy soil region causing soil strength to decrease which may increase the likelihood of failure of an owt during the earthquake to study the liquefaction effect zienkiewicz and shiomi 1984 developed a model to couple soil skeleton and pore fluid interaction this method must be applied to 3d continuous elements to determine soil effective stress and the pore water pressure fields for winkler springs p y t z and q z curve springs to model soil since the pore water pressure is unknown a suitable transient method cannot be established there have been several empirical methods proposed to deal with this problem in the literature while a reduction factor is often used to decrease soil stiffness liu and dobry 1995 brandenberg 2005 chang and hutchinson 2013 dash et al 2017 however they still cannot be appropriately used in a time domain simulation due to the unknown time history pore water pressure in this study we use a conservative method to perform the soil liquefaction analysis to initially investigate this effect for owt support structures during earthquakes the procedures are listed as follows 1 the depth h l of the soil liquefaction is assumed and we set h l as a parameter to study the effect of soil liquefaction during earthquakes 2 all the sandy soil is liquefied above the depth specified in step 1 after a specific number of seconds t l from the beginning of the earthquake while the soil stiffness is set to 1 10 of the original p y and t z curves according to the research of liu et al 1995 and interpolation is used between zero and t l seconds after the seismic load in this study t l is set at 10 s due to the strong seismic motions used in this paper 3 illustration of environmental loads of an owt located at the seismic zone 3 1 illustration of seismic loads in the finite element analysis as shown in fig 1 the global x direction is set to the wind direction and the global z direction is the vertical direction the seismic accelerations are applied to local x y and z directions as shown in fig 1 while the local z direction coincides with the global z direction the seismic response spectrum according to ibc ibc 2006 shown in fig 2 is used in this paper the site design level spectrum acceleration coefficient s a is shown in eq 1 considering that the owt is affected by the high period range the latest version of ibc 2010 is not used in this study since the acceleration of the high period range decays 1 t 2 faster than the 1 t of ibc 2006 we approximated the data in the taiwan strait as t s 0 5625 s and s ds 0 8 as used in eq 1 the seismic motion generation software simqke then was used to generate the time history seismic acceleration of this spectrum with pgas of 0 28 0 32 0 38 0 44 and 0 52 g respectively for five seismic loads in the local x and 70 and 30 of that pga in the local y and global z directions then the angle θ shown in fig 1 between the global x and local x directions is set at 0 45 90 135 180 225 270 and 315 respectively in the analysis it is noted that the correlations between the three direction seismic acceleration data are smaller than 5 where one group is shown in fig 3 for the same pga and angle θ three different groups of earthquakes with different random number seeds were generated so there are 24 seismic loads 8 directions and 3 3 direction earthquakes that will be used to combine with wave and wind loads for a fixed pga this seismic acceleration is applied on the sea bed the soil properties at the soil surface and at a depth of 50 m are shown in table 1 the soil is loose to medium sandy soil and the interpolation is used to find the soil properties between the two depths soil properties below the depth of 50 m are assumed to be the same as those at the depth of 50 m we used 10 layers with the interval of 10 m for the shake 91 input data while the soil properties of the first five layer were also interpolated from the two depths using the average depth of the soil layer the shake 91 program is then used to generate the acceleration field in each soil layer and fig 4 shows the maximum horizontal acceleration distribution along the vertical direction 1 s a s d s 0 4 0 6 t t 0 f o r 0 t t 0 s d s f o r t 0 t t s s d 1 t f o r 1 t 3 2 illustration of wind and wave loads in addition to the seismic loads the wind wave and ocean current loads based on iec 61400 3 were used in the design of owt support structures in this study the wind loads were divided into the rotor nacelle assembly rna wind load and the tower and substructure wind load the wind load conditions were based on turbsim jonkman and kilcher 2012 to establish the full field wind the rna wind load evaluated using fast jonkman and jonkman 2016 involves the use of three time dependent forces and moments applied to the top of the tower the wind loads of the tower and support structure based on the aerodynamics are shown in eq 2 where ρ is the density of air a is the projected area perpendicular to the flow v 0 is the wind velocity perpendicular to element and c d is the drag coefficient 2 f w i n d 1 2 ρ a v 0 2 c d the marine environmental loads for the owt support structures included waves currents and water levels respectively the wave and current loads were evaluated using morison s equation 1950 based on the statistical data for the wind farm the various wave conditions used in this study are shown in table 2 where regular and irregular waves are included for the regular wave the stream line function theory is used dnv rp c205 2010 and for the irregular wave the 2nd order theory is used for the current load the normal current model ncm includes the wind generated current velocity u w of 0 3 m s the extreme current model ecm includes the subsurface current velocities u ss and u w without the breaking wave surf induced current where u ss with 1 year recurrence is set to 0 5 m s and u w is set to 0 3 m s according to iec 61400 1 2005 the earthquake loading is required to be superposed with operational loading equal to the higher of a loads during normal power production by averaging over the lifetime or b loads during emergency shutdown for a wind speed selected so that the loads prior to the shutdown are equal to those obtained with a for dnvgl st 0437 dnv gl 2016 the seismic loads include 11 1 earthquake with power production during normal operation 11 2 earthquake plus grid loss during power production and a shutdown procedure possibly triggered by the earthquake and 11 3 earthquake plus grid loss parked standing still or idling under the reference wind speed with a 1 year recurrence period v 1 iec 61400 3 does not contain specific procedures but dnvgl st 0437 does in fact the above statements describing the two standards are similar so we apply those of dnvgl st 0437 to iec 61400 3 thus the dlcs without seismic loads are shown in table 2 and those with seismic loads are shown in table 3 see table 4 4 parametric study due to earthquake effect 4 1 finite element model the nrel 5 mw baseline owt with the jacket type supported structure under iec 61400 3 class i a is analyzed where the average depth of the sea is 50 m and the soil is moderate soft sandy soil with a submerged internal frictional angle of 30 fig 5 shows the proposed finite element model of the owt supported structures where the section dimensions are the initial settings and the final results are determined after seven optimal design cycles the yield strength of steel is 345 mpa the steel young s modulus is 204 gpa the poisson s ratio is 0 3 and the density is 7 9 t m3 in the finite element analysis a 3d 2 node beam element is used to model the columns bracings piles and tower 4 node plate element is used to model the platform at the bottom of the tower and the p y t z and q z curve springs are used to simulate the soil structure interaction according to api formulations the static loads such as dead and live working loads were applied and analyzed using a one step statistical analysis during the initial analysis the iec 61400 3 loads in table 2 and the seismic loads in table 3 were included to perform the ultimate load analysis using the direct integration newmark s method rayleigh damping was used with mass and stiffness damping values of 0 04 s and 0 01s respectively according to reference shake91 idriss 1993 which gave an approximate 4 damping ratio at frequencies of 0 3 and 4 hz respectively the optimal sizes of the member sections after seven cycles of the finite element analysis and steel design were obtained and the total steel weight was then calculated in the finite element analysis the procedures were as follows 1 for the wind field generated from turbsim and the hub forces calculated from the fast simulation we neglected the data from the first 100 s and used the 100th second as the zero second of the wind load in the finite element analysis of the owt support structure this is because the fast results at the beginning are not stable due to the fake homogeneous solution 2 for the load without the seismic load the time step length was set at 0 05 s and 14 000 time steps total analysis time 700 s were simulated 3 for the load with the seismic load the earthquake was set to attack the structure at 100 s since the results for the first 100 s can include a fake homogeneous solution for the time history analysis the time step length was set at 0 01 s and 18 000 time steps total analysis time 180 s were simulated since a high frequency seismic load requires a smaller time step length to obtain correct analytical results 4 the extreme member forces calculated from the data for 100 s to the last time were used to perform the steel design of the member section 4 2 the effect of the wind and wave loads to indicate the importance of a specific load the steel weight ratio r load of the load is defined as follows 3 rload wload wtotal where w total is the total steel weight of the owt support structure at the final design stage and w load is the steel weight controlled by a specific load at the final design stage as shown in tables 2 and 3 fig 6 shows the total steel weight during each design cycle where the design results converge after four design cycles out of which four to seven design cycles were fairly stable the details of the controlled dlcs are shown in table 2 in which the dlc is the design load case according to iec 61400 3 the steel weight ratio is defined in eq 3 a positive wave height is defined as the wave height of a regular wave and a negative wave height refers to the significant wave height of an irregular wave this table indicates the following features 1 the controlled dlc without seismic loads is dominated by the extreme wind speed dlc 6 1a model ewm in which the turbine is parked but attacked by a misaligned wind and large irregular waves the irregular waves with h s 10 12 m producing large wave forces on the support structure is the major reason to control the steel design moreover for the dlc 6 1 of the iec 61400 3 a yaw misalignment of up to 15 using the steady ewm or a mean yaw misalignment of 8o using the turbulent ewm must be imposed in this study the latter was used and this 8 yaw misalignment did cause a serious problem for the support structure due to a large amount of torsion in the vertical direction 2 for the case without seismic loads 34 of the steel design weight is controlled by the power production dlc 2 1 plus the occurrence of a fault dlc 2 1 requires simulating a control system fault or loss of the electrical network we set the three blades to go out of control after 300 s of the simulation which means that the pitch angles of the three blades were under control before 300 s and were subsequently fixed at the angles of the 300th second fig 7 shows the hub wind forces under dlc 2 1 which shows the blades sustain considerably large forces after 300 s this is because when the fault blades stop at small pitch angles due to a weak turbulence wind the blade forces will increase significantly when a strong turbulence wind attacks after a weak one although this situation occurs randomly it is quite possible that faulty blades can be subjected to these large forces 3 dlc 11 2 comprises a superposition of the earthquake and a shut down procedure possibly triggered by the earthquake we set the emergency shutdown to occur 15 s after the beginning of the earthquake the fast analysis results indicate that the emergency shutdown produced a big jump force at the hub but this force generated from the normal wind profile combined with the seismic load still did not dominate the steel design proposed in this paper however this force generated from the emergency shutdown was highly dependent on the blade data and control system so it cannot be ignored in the analysis of owt support structures it was also noted that slowing the pitch rate during the emergency shutdown can significantly reduce the jump in the wind force 4 for the case with seismic loads the earthquake dlc 11 3 plus grid loss parked standing still or idling also did not significantly control the results for the steel design since the blades are parked for dlc 11 3 the wind forces from the blades are small due to the strong wind the wave forces are large in this case but they still have less influence than the blade wind forces at the highest owt location during the dlc 11 1 power production under consideration in the current analysis 5 the wind speed of the controlled dlc is not often at the maximum working speed of 25 m s but rather is near the rated speed of 11 3 m s especially in the case of the analyses with seismic loads this is because the small pitch angle of the three blades has to be set to handle large left forces so the object rated power can be reached but the wind force acting on the support structure from the three blades will also be large this condition shows the controlled loading cases can be complicated and suggests that one should include all the possible wind speeds and wave conditions in the analysis 4 3 the effect of earthquake peak ground acceleration and soil liquefaction since the analysis and design results are complicated and are coupled with the wind wave and seismic loads simplified useful parameters should be used to discuss the parametric study we therefore used the following two parameters to represent the steel design result due to seismic loads the first parameter s e q is the ratio of the total steel design weight with seismic loads over that without seismic loads 4 s e q w e q w n o n e q where w e q and w n o n e q are the total steel weight of the support structure at the final design stage with and without seismic loads respectively this ratio can be used to understand the increase of the total steel design weight due to the earthquake effect the other parameter t r e q l o a d is the total steel weight ratio due to the dlc with the seismic load as follows 5 t r e q l o a d r e q l o a d where r e q l o a d is the steel weight ratio r load in eq 3 of the seismic load this parameter can be used to determine what percentage of the steel weight is controlled by seismic loads the changes in the design results for the above two parameters with the earthquake pgas are shown in figs 8 and 9 which indicate the following features it is noted that the dominant period t s in fig 2 of the earthquake is set to 0 5625 s which is in a normal t s range for long period earthquakes such as near fault effect we will discuss them in section 4 5 1 although the pga of the earthquake is not large for example 0 28 0 32 g there are still some structural members that are controlled by the seismic loads but the increase in the steel weight controlled by the seismic loads is very small this is because the mass of the owt support structure is not large so the inertia forces generated from the seismic acceleration are still much smaller than the wind and wave forces it is also noted that this condition can be found for high raised steel building structures that are often dominated by the wind load but is not the case for small or mediate scale seismic loads another important reason for the steel weight being small is that the main frequency range of seismic loads is much larger than the first mode natural frequencies of owt support structures so the resonance or amplification of seismic loads is not obvious 2 when the pga of the earthquake is between 0 38 and 0 44 g more than 20 of the steel weight and even as much as 40 of the steel weight with a 20 m soil liquefaction are controlled by the dlcs of the seismic loads however the percentage increase in the steel weight is not more than 5 which means that the seismic loads at this pga range are still not much larger than those for the original dlcs specified in iec 61400 3 the reason for this can be found in fig 10 which shows the total base shear force of the seismic load with a pga of 0 38 g and a 20 m soil liquefaction the total irregular wave force applied to the structure under dlc 6 1a and the wind force at the hub under dlc 2 1 this figure indicates that the wave force of dlc 6 1a is larger than the seismic force under a pga of 0 38 g and a 20 m soil liquefaction and the hub wind force applied at the most influential location can be about 1 2 of the maximum seismic force 3 when the pga of the seismic loads is large such as 0 52 g almost all of the member design is controlled by the seismic loads and the percentage increase in the total steel design weight is more than 20 while it is near 40 under the 20 m soil liquefaction the sudden increase in the total steel design weight as shown in fig 9 is due to the overly large seismic loads applied to the owt moreover such a large pga on the seabed requires large seismic loads to transmit along the deep soil as shown in fig 4 where the acceleration at each soil layer with a 0 52 g pga is always much larger than those with other smaller pgas it should be noted that the owt project should be seriously considered for a region with a required design seismic pga over 0 5 g 4 a significantly conservative soil liquefaction condition is set in this study where the soil at a 20 m depth is liquefied this condition does control the required steel design result compared to that without soil liquefaction fig 11 shows the total base shear forces under the earthquakes with pgas of 0 28 g and 0 38 g in the frequency domain using the fast fourier transform fft this figure indicates that the natural frequencies of the liquefied cases are lower than the non liquefied ones due to low structural stiffness and the natural frequency of the second mode which is close to the major frequency of the seismic load cannot be ignored in the analysis since the soil liquefaction effect during earthquakes cannot be ignored especially for a large pga case the deep pile foundation should be necessary and the jacket type owt often contains group long piles that are good resistance to soil liquefaction 4 4 the effect of the tuned mass damper tmd tmd can be used to reduce the vibration of the owt support structure so this section investigates the efficiency of a tmd to reduce the first mode vibration during earthquakes when the mass ratio μ between the tmd and the owt support structure is set the stiffness k tmd and damping c tmd of this single tmd can be designed as follows sadek et al 1997 6 ω t m d ω 1 1 μ φ 1 ξ μ φ 1 μ φ and ξ t m d φ ξ 1 μ μ 1 μ where ξ is the first mode damping ratio φ is the amplitude of the first mode vibration for a unit modal participation factor computed at the location of the tmd ω t m d is the optimal frequency of the tmd and ξ t m d is the optimal damping ratio of the tmd then the optimal stiffness and damping of the tmd are 7 k t m d m t m d ω t m d 2 and c t m d 2 m t m d ω t m d ξ t m d we put the tmd on the tower top of the above designed owt support structure where the optimal steel sections are determined under the dlcs in tables 2 and 3 with the seismic pga of 0 52 g without soil liquefaction the first mode natural frequency of the owt support structure is 0 29474 hz ω 1 1 8519 rad s under the natural frequency finite element analysis the tmd parameters are μ 1 04 ξ 3 φ 1 342 ω t m d 1 7732 rad s ξ t m d 26 28 k tmd 62 887 kn m and damping c tmd 18 64 kn s m fig 12 shows the stress ratios of the steel design for the main columns diagonals and piles changing with the material property number while the smaller number represents the lower vertical coordinate the stress ratio of the steel design is defined as the actual member stress over the capacity stress of the member and the ratio larger than one means the section has failed this figure indicates the following features 1 except diagonals the stress ratios of other members including towers columns and piles with the tmd are always much smaller than those without the tmd even for 20 m soil liquefaction the natural frequency decreases from 0 29474 hz without soil liquefaction to 0 2801 hz with 20 m soil liquefaction since this frequency change is not large the vibration can still be damped with the tmd for its properties without including the soil liquefaction effect it is noted that the four strong piles of 70 m long and 2 m wide should be the main reason for not much reducing the natural frequency during 20 m soil liquefaction for diagonals the members at the bottom are little influenced by the tmd and the reason should be further investigation nevertheless a first mode tmd is efficient to reduce the vibration coupled from wind wave and seismic loads under the ultimate analysis 2 this figure indicates that soil liquefaction may slightly reduce the stress ratios for towers and columns and a little enlarge those for diagonals those slight deviations are due to the change in natural frequencies during soil liquefaction so the results of time history analyses with and without soil liquefaction will be different the difference between the components of the superstructure are not large however the stress ratio of foundation piles can be largely different for the cases with and without soil liquefaction because the pile moments and forces should be largely increased near the location of the soil liquefaction surface 20 m below the seabed in the current analysis 4 5 the effect of different dominant periods ts of earthquakes except the pga another important parameter of the seismic load is the dominant period t s as shown in fig 2 while t s is often within the range of 0 4 0 8 s for earthquakes with long periods t s will be large but this condition is often due to the near fault earthquakes which can contain a single peak acceleration with a period over 2 s except near fault earthquakes although t s larger than 1 s is not common this section still studies the effect of t s over this value fig 13 shows the required steel weight in the api optimal steel design changing with the dominant period t s of various earthquakes under the pga of 0 32 and 0 36 g this figure indicates 1 the steel weight required for the optimal design increases with t s and the relationship between them is greater than linear the reason is because a large t s causes the seismic dominant frequency to approach the natural frequency of owt support structure which produces large vibrations 2 for earthquakes with t s smaller than 0 8 s and pga smaller than 0 36 g the increase of the steel weight in the design with and without soil liquefaction is not obvious since the major part of the steel design is still controlled by the wind and wave loads 3 when t s is large such as more than 1 s the design of the steel structure due to seismic loads will become more and more important because the pga required for most common seismic belts such as taiwan about 0 32 g may greatly increase the required steel weight of the owt support structures in addition if the seabed is sandy soil soil liquefaction is also very important in this case 4 typically t s is smaller than 1 s for most of seismic zones but near fault earthquakes often contain a large impulse with a period of more than 2 s since the impulse period is close to the natural frequency of the owt support structure this single impulse may result in a substantial increase in the required steel design weight thus this topic should be further studied 5 conclusions in this paper owt support structures were subjected to seismic loads using the finite element method with the ssi effect and the api steel design is then used to determine the optimal steel design in the finite element model beam elements were used to simulate the superstructure and piles while p y t z and q z elements were used to simulate the soil using the response spectrum and the pga of earthquakes we adopted the simqke program to generate the seismic accelerations of an artificial earthquake in the time domain the shake 91 program was then used to generate the acceleration field in each soil layer where the acceleration fields were integrated with the displacement fields applied to one end of the p y t z and q z elements we used a conservative method to conduct the soil liquefaction analysis to initially investigate this effect for owt support structures during earthquakes in a sandy soil region the wind wave and ocean current loads based on iec 61400 3 were also coupled with the seismic loads to analyze owt support structures the nrel 5 mw baseline owt with the jacket type supported structure under iec 61400 3 class i a were analyzed the analysis and design results indicate that the controlled dlc without seismic loads was mainly dominated by the ewm of dlc 6 1a in which the turbine was parked but attacked by large irregular waves producing large forces on the support structure the dlc 2 1 power production plus occurrence of fault controls about 1 3 of the steel design weight this is because when the fault blades stop at small pitch angles due to a weak turbulence wind the blade forces will increase greatly following an attack by a strong turbulence wind for the case with seismic loads the emergency shutdown of dlc 11 2 produced a big jump force at the hub and this dlc often does not dominate the steel design however if the jump force is large one can change the control system to slow down the pitch rate during the emergency shutdown to reduce the jump of the wind force dlc 11 3 is defined as a condition in which the parked blades are under a strong wind and waves with a seismic load since the blades are parked the wind forces from the blades are small although the wave forces are large in this case they still have less influence than the blade wind forces at the highest owt location during the dlc 11 1 power production for earthquakes with pgas smaller than 0 32 g and the dominant period t s smaller than 1 s there may be some structural members that are controlled by the seismic loads but the increase in the steel weight controlled by the seismic loads is very small this is because the resonance or amplification of seismic loads is not obvious due to the big difference between the main frequency range of the seismic loads and the first natural owt support structure frequencies when the seismic dominant period t s is more than 1 s although this is not common in most of seismic zones the design of the steel structure due to seismic loads will be important and earthquakes with pga near or over 0 32 g may greatly increase the required steel weight of the owt support structures in addition if the seabed is sandy soil soil liquefaction cannot be ignored in this case when the pga of the seismic loads was over 0 52 g almost all the members were controlled by the seismic loads and the percentage increase in the total steel design weight was more than 20 while it was nearly 40 under the 20 m soil liquefaction we therefore suggest that owt projects should be avoided in this strong earthquake zone a significantly conservative soil liquefaction condition was set in this study which does control the required steel design result compared to that without soil liquefaction but the increase in the total required steel design weight was still not significant for earthquakes with pgas less than 0 38 g this paper also indicates that a first mode tmd is efficient to reduce the vibration coupled from wind wave and seismic loads under the ultimate analysis the deep piles of the jacket type support structure cause that the natural frequency change is not large during soil liquefaction and the vibration can still be damped with the tmd for its properties without including the soil liquefaction effect 
22638,this research provides an analysis framework for offshore wind turbine owt support structures subjected to seismic wind and wave loads using the finite element method with soil structure interaction and a conservative soil liquefaction analysis is developed the nrel 5 mw jacket type owt under iec 61400 3 is analyzed the results indicate that seismic loads combined with wind and wave loads during power production often control the design especially near the rated wind speed for earthquakes with a peak ground acceleration pga smaller than 0 32 g and the dominant period t s smaller than 1 s the increase in steel weight due to seismic loads is small because the amplification of the seismic loads is not obvious for pga over 0 52 g almost all the members are controlled by the seismic loads and the increase in the steel design weight can be over 40 this paper also indicates that first mode tuned mass dampers for jacket type support structure with deep piles are efficient to reduce the vibration coupled from wind wave and seismic loads even with 20 m soil liquefaction keywords earthquake finite element analysis peak ground acceleration offshore wind turbine soil structure interaction steel structure optimal design 1 introduction offshore wind turbines owts play an important role in the field of renewable energy and they can sustain major loads from wind and waves however due to the fact that increasing numbers of owts are being constructed in earthquake zones seismic analysis of their responses during earthquakes has become increasingly important in the literature only a few studies have been conducted addressing this topic hence we will briefly mention those investigations that can be found in the literature and then discuss the difference of the current study from others in the end of this section several studies have emphasized the importance of the foundation and soil haciefendioglu 2012 conducted a response analysis of wind turbines subjected to stochastic excitation using a three dimensional 3d finite element model the results showed that the soil structure interaction ssi affects the behavior of wind turbines in a seismic situation harte et al 2014 showed the seismic response of an onshore wind turbine using a multi degree of freedom model and the results indicated that ssi may significantly affect the modal frequency of a turbine structure zhang et al 2014a b developed a structural design for a large scale pre stressed concrete bucket foundation for owts with seismic loads and their simulation results showed that the foundation can improve resistance to soil liquefaction during earthquakes alati et al 2015 investigated the seismic response of tripod and jacket foundations using fully coupled nonlinear time domain simulations and found that the earthquake loading may cause a significant increase in resultant stress demands mardfekri and gardoni 2015 developed a framework to assess the structural performance of owts subjected to extreme wind speeds and earthquake ground motions using 3d finite element model they indicated that the foundation type and soil conditions must be considered in the seismic zone anastasopoulos and theofilou 2016 investigated a hybrid foundation for owts a detailed comparison was performed between the hybrid foundation and a monopile type foundation they concluded that the hybrid foundation had an advantage related to buckling prevention and lateral resistance in earthquake situations santangelo et al 2018 performed the time domain uncoupled analysis under seismic and environmental loads for owts and investigated pertinent levels of aerodynamic damping there have been some studies using centrifuge or shaking table tests to simulate the behavior of support structures yu et al 2015 investigated the seismic response of gravity and monopile foundations using earthquake centrifuge tests they found that the different foundations exhibited quite different behavior seong et al 2017 used centrifuge modeling and the finite element method to evaluate the natural frequency of owts a centrifuge test can be used to verify and calibrate simplified estimations of ssi on owts prowell et al 2014 conducted shaking table tests to estimate the structural response and compared the results with the fast jonkman and buhl 2005 simulation this research provided useful insights into seismic responses for design load cases involving combined wind and earthquake loads ssi for owts under seismic loads has been studied by some researchers ku and chien 2016 presented a numerical model of an owt jacket foundation subjected to seismic loading and proposed a procedure to design owt foundation piles under different soil conditions santangelo et al 2016 investigated owts subjected to different earthquake records and compared the results with fully coupled simulations they proposed a time domain uncoupled analysis implementation for seismic assessment of wind turbines under operating conditions where the nonlinear foundation behavior was included wang et al 2017 performed the numerical analysis of the owt support structure under seismic wind and sea loads while the results indicated that the interaction of earthquake wind wave and current loads should be taken into account austin and jerath 2017 studied the ssi effect on the seismic response of specific wind turbines with different types of foundation using the finite element method they indicated that the ssi effect on the seismic response of wind turbine is not significant huo et al 2018 discussed the seismic response of wind turbine towers with long period ground motions when ssi was considered and the result was compared to the value induced by the bedrock wave kjørlaug and kaynia 2015 performed a finite element analysis of a wind turbine under seismic excitation with ssi and the vertical earthquake was considered as a critical load in the design vatanchian and shooshtari 2018 investigated the seismic response of a wind turbine with ssi and concluded that the effect of ssi is detrimental for turbine in operating condition some analytical approaches were proposed to evaluate the performance of support structures under seismic loads using the fragility analysis mo et al 2017 performed the seismic fragility analysis of a monopile owt and the fragility curves were plotted to assess the probability of exceeding different damage states patil et al 2016 investigated the structural performance of wind turbine tower under strong ground motion through seismic fragility analysis and the foundation overturning was found to be the most critical condition asareh et al 2016 analyzed the 5 mw nrel wind turbine considering different earthquakes and wind intensities using a finite element model while the fragility analysis of the structure was performed on the design of wind turbines yuan et al 2017 studied the fragility of the large scale owt under the combination of seismic and aerodynamic loads by push over analyses and the result showed that the owt subjected to the load combination in normal operation condition is safer than in the parked condition to mitigate the dynamic response of owts some studies proposed to install control device at the top of the tower zuo et al 2017 used multiple tune mass dampers mtmds to control vibration from fundamental and higher modes under multiple hazards while using smaller mtmds can significantly improve the robustness of the control system and facilitate the installations hussan et al 2018 investigated that mtmds installed at the top and base of the turbine tower and from his research the performance of mtmds seems to be prominent in suppressing the first two vibrational modes yang et al 2018 developed and applied a numerical analysis framework compared with the prediction calculated by other numerical methods the soil liquefaction can cause soil settlement in seismic region so it is important to take liquefaction into account in owt design zhang et al 2014a b performed the analysis of composite bucket foundation to prevent soil liquefaction and the foundation provides a good resistance to soil liquefaction during the earthquake beside of external loading environmental conditions and ssi effect some researches discussed the effect of turbine tower structure and material with different conditions sadowski et al 2017 conducted the analysis of a wind turbine tower with weld imperfections which was found to have a significant effect on the intensities of ground accelerations vassiliou et al 2015 studied the behavior of the top heavy cantilever column on a rigid support surface and the overturning stability of the model on large excitation was not effected by its deformability alamo et al 2018 studied the ssi effects on the superstructures of owts and yielded the conclusion that the profile of superficial layer of soil is important to the estimation of the owt system fundamental frequency and damping katsanos et al 2016 presented a comprehensive review on the researches relative to seismic analysis and design of wind turbines and the key factors for wind turbine s seismic performance is discussed beside of environmental load conditions structural vibration could shorten fatigue life of owts jin et al 2018 built a dynamic model optimizing tuned mass damper tmd parameters to mitigate the structural vibration and the effect of fatigue the above references studied the owt structural behavior using the seismic analysis without the effect of soil liquefaction however in sandy seabed it is almost impossible to avoid soil liquefaction under a strong earthquake in this study the nrel 5 mw jacket type owt was used in the seismic regions while the 3d finite element analysis and steel design with the ssi under the dead wind wave current and seismic loads were performed according to iec 61400 3 2009 and api design code 1997 moreover a conservative scheme was used to estimate the liquefaction effect during earthquakes while the first mode tuned mass damper for the reduction of structural vibration was investigated with and without soil liquefaction 2 a seismic analysis and design scheme for owt support structures to analyze the responses of owt support structures subjected to seismic loads the geological conditions of the wind farm site the seismic response spectrum and the soil structure interaction ssi must take into account this study uses the newmark direct integration method to perform the time history finite element analysis and the api steel design is then used to find the optimal member thickness in the finite element model beam elements are used to simulate the superstructure and piles while nonlinear p y t z and q z elements based on the api specification are used to simulate the soil behavior the soil profile can contain a number of layers with different soil properties and the stiffness matrixes of p y t z and q z curve elements as shown in fig 1 are generated according to the displacement field of the current time step the newton raphson method is finally used to solve this nonlinear matrix equation while about two to five iterations are used to obtain a convergent solution the procedures shown in fig 1 are illustrated as follows 1 the material properties of the soil at each layer should be known and the seismic response spectrum needs to be obtained at a certain soil layer while that at the sea bed is used in this paper 2 using the response spectrum and the peak ground acceleration pga we adopt the simqke program 1976 to generate the three direction seismic accelerations of the artificial earthquake in the time domain three different groups of the three direction artificial earthquakes will be generated using three different random values in the simqke program 3 the shake 91 1993 program is used to generate the acceleration field in each soil layer while the known acceleration field at a certain layer the soil surface used in this paper as mentioned in 2 is the input data the acceleration fields are then integrated to the displacement fields and at each soil layer the displacement field is applied to one end of the p y t z and q z only at the soil layer of the pile bottom while the other end is connected to the pile 4 in the finite element analysis the static analysis under the dead load is performed initially and the time history newmark direct integration analysis is performed under the coupling of seismic wind and wave loads when the tubular member is submerged into the water level the circular area of the member multiplied by the water mass density is set to the additional mass per length for this beam element 5 in the dynamic analysis under a loading case at each time step each beam member contains 12 strength components including axial forces shear forces torsions and moments at the two ends of the beam we select the 24 groups of the beam 12 strength components using the maximum and minimum values from all the load and time steps for example a group is due to the maximum torsion at the right beam node and other strengths of this group such as axial forces moments and shear forces are obtained at the same time step of the maximum torsion thus the 12 strength components of each group are simultaneous one of which is the extreme value of all the loads and time steps 6 the steel design of a beam element is performed according to the api rp 2a lrfd code using the 24 group beam strengths for each loading case the section diameter of a beam element is set to be constant and the design program is used to find the maximum design thickness under all loading cases the thickness of the next design cycle is then determined from this maximum design thickness for each beam element 7 the next optimal analysis and design cycle begin using the member thicknesses of the last analysis and design cycle until the variations in thickness of all the sections are small the procedures stop in this study seven analysis and design cycles are enough to obtain the stable final design section dimensions an important issue is that soil liquefaction may occur due to earthquakes in a sandy soil region causing soil strength to decrease which may increase the likelihood of failure of an owt during the earthquake to study the liquefaction effect zienkiewicz and shiomi 1984 developed a model to couple soil skeleton and pore fluid interaction this method must be applied to 3d continuous elements to determine soil effective stress and the pore water pressure fields for winkler springs p y t z and q z curve springs to model soil since the pore water pressure is unknown a suitable transient method cannot be established there have been several empirical methods proposed to deal with this problem in the literature while a reduction factor is often used to decrease soil stiffness liu and dobry 1995 brandenberg 2005 chang and hutchinson 2013 dash et al 2017 however they still cannot be appropriately used in a time domain simulation due to the unknown time history pore water pressure in this study we use a conservative method to perform the soil liquefaction analysis to initially investigate this effect for owt support structures during earthquakes the procedures are listed as follows 1 the depth h l of the soil liquefaction is assumed and we set h l as a parameter to study the effect of soil liquefaction during earthquakes 2 all the sandy soil is liquefied above the depth specified in step 1 after a specific number of seconds t l from the beginning of the earthquake while the soil stiffness is set to 1 10 of the original p y and t z curves according to the research of liu et al 1995 and interpolation is used between zero and t l seconds after the seismic load in this study t l is set at 10 s due to the strong seismic motions used in this paper 3 illustration of environmental loads of an owt located at the seismic zone 3 1 illustration of seismic loads in the finite element analysis as shown in fig 1 the global x direction is set to the wind direction and the global z direction is the vertical direction the seismic accelerations are applied to local x y and z directions as shown in fig 1 while the local z direction coincides with the global z direction the seismic response spectrum according to ibc ibc 2006 shown in fig 2 is used in this paper the site design level spectrum acceleration coefficient s a is shown in eq 1 considering that the owt is affected by the high period range the latest version of ibc 2010 is not used in this study since the acceleration of the high period range decays 1 t 2 faster than the 1 t of ibc 2006 we approximated the data in the taiwan strait as t s 0 5625 s and s ds 0 8 as used in eq 1 the seismic motion generation software simqke then was used to generate the time history seismic acceleration of this spectrum with pgas of 0 28 0 32 0 38 0 44 and 0 52 g respectively for five seismic loads in the local x and 70 and 30 of that pga in the local y and global z directions then the angle θ shown in fig 1 between the global x and local x directions is set at 0 45 90 135 180 225 270 and 315 respectively in the analysis it is noted that the correlations between the three direction seismic acceleration data are smaller than 5 where one group is shown in fig 3 for the same pga and angle θ three different groups of earthquakes with different random number seeds were generated so there are 24 seismic loads 8 directions and 3 3 direction earthquakes that will be used to combine with wave and wind loads for a fixed pga this seismic acceleration is applied on the sea bed the soil properties at the soil surface and at a depth of 50 m are shown in table 1 the soil is loose to medium sandy soil and the interpolation is used to find the soil properties between the two depths soil properties below the depth of 50 m are assumed to be the same as those at the depth of 50 m we used 10 layers with the interval of 10 m for the shake 91 input data while the soil properties of the first five layer were also interpolated from the two depths using the average depth of the soil layer the shake 91 program is then used to generate the acceleration field in each soil layer and fig 4 shows the maximum horizontal acceleration distribution along the vertical direction 1 s a s d s 0 4 0 6 t t 0 f o r 0 t t 0 s d s f o r t 0 t t s s d 1 t f o r 1 t 3 2 illustration of wind and wave loads in addition to the seismic loads the wind wave and ocean current loads based on iec 61400 3 were used in the design of owt support structures in this study the wind loads were divided into the rotor nacelle assembly rna wind load and the tower and substructure wind load the wind load conditions were based on turbsim jonkman and kilcher 2012 to establish the full field wind the rna wind load evaluated using fast jonkman and jonkman 2016 involves the use of three time dependent forces and moments applied to the top of the tower the wind loads of the tower and support structure based on the aerodynamics are shown in eq 2 where ρ is the density of air a is the projected area perpendicular to the flow v 0 is the wind velocity perpendicular to element and c d is the drag coefficient 2 f w i n d 1 2 ρ a v 0 2 c d the marine environmental loads for the owt support structures included waves currents and water levels respectively the wave and current loads were evaluated using morison s equation 1950 based on the statistical data for the wind farm the various wave conditions used in this study are shown in table 2 where regular and irregular waves are included for the regular wave the stream line function theory is used dnv rp c205 2010 and for the irregular wave the 2nd order theory is used for the current load the normal current model ncm includes the wind generated current velocity u w of 0 3 m s the extreme current model ecm includes the subsurface current velocities u ss and u w without the breaking wave surf induced current where u ss with 1 year recurrence is set to 0 5 m s and u w is set to 0 3 m s according to iec 61400 1 2005 the earthquake loading is required to be superposed with operational loading equal to the higher of a loads during normal power production by averaging over the lifetime or b loads during emergency shutdown for a wind speed selected so that the loads prior to the shutdown are equal to those obtained with a for dnvgl st 0437 dnv gl 2016 the seismic loads include 11 1 earthquake with power production during normal operation 11 2 earthquake plus grid loss during power production and a shutdown procedure possibly triggered by the earthquake and 11 3 earthquake plus grid loss parked standing still or idling under the reference wind speed with a 1 year recurrence period v 1 iec 61400 3 does not contain specific procedures but dnvgl st 0437 does in fact the above statements describing the two standards are similar so we apply those of dnvgl st 0437 to iec 61400 3 thus the dlcs without seismic loads are shown in table 2 and those with seismic loads are shown in table 3 see table 4 4 parametric study due to earthquake effect 4 1 finite element model the nrel 5 mw baseline owt with the jacket type supported structure under iec 61400 3 class i a is analyzed where the average depth of the sea is 50 m and the soil is moderate soft sandy soil with a submerged internal frictional angle of 30 fig 5 shows the proposed finite element model of the owt supported structures where the section dimensions are the initial settings and the final results are determined after seven optimal design cycles the yield strength of steel is 345 mpa the steel young s modulus is 204 gpa the poisson s ratio is 0 3 and the density is 7 9 t m3 in the finite element analysis a 3d 2 node beam element is used to model the columns bracings piles and tower 4 node plate element is used to model the platform at the bottom of the tower and the p y t z and q z curve springs are used to simulate the soil structure interaction according to api formulations the static loads such as dead and live working loads were applied and analyzed using a one step statistical analysis during the initial analysis the iec 61400 3 loads in table 2 and the seismic loads in table 3 were included to perform the ultimate load analysis using the direct integration newmark s method rayleigh damping was used with mass and stiffness damping values of 0 04 s and 0 01s respectively according to reference shake91 idriss 1993 which gave an approximate 4 damping ratio at frequencies of 0 3 and 4 hz respectively the optimal sizes of the member sections after seven cycles of the finite element analysis and steel design were obtained and the total steel weight was then calculated in the finite element analysis the procedures were as follows 1 for the wind field generated from turbsim and the hub forces calculated from the fast simulation we neglected the data from the first 100 s and used the 100th second as the zero second of the wind load in the finite element analysis of the owt support structure this is because the fast results at the beginning are not stable due to the fake homogeneous solution 2 for the load without the seismic load the time step length was set at 0 05 s and 14 000 time steps total analysis time 700 s were simulated 3 for the load with the seismic load the earthquake was set to attack the structure at 100 s since the results for the first 100 s can include a fake homogeneous solution for the time history analysis the time step length was set at 0 01 s and 18 000 time steps total analysis time 180 s were simulated since a high frequency seismic load requires a smaller time step length to obtain correct analytical results 4 the extreme member forces calculated from the data for 100 s to the last time were used to perform the steel design of the member section 4 2 the effect of the wind and wave loads to indicate the importance of a specific load the steel weight ratio r load of the load is defined as follows 3 rload wload wtotal where w total is the total steel weight of the owt support structure at the final design stage and w load is the steel weight controlled by a specific load at the final design stage as shown in tables 2 and 3 fig 6 shows the total steel weight during each design cycle where the design results converge after four design cycles out of which four to seven design cycles were fairly stable the details of the controlled dlcs are shown in table 2 in which the dlc is the design load case according to iec 61400 3 the steel weight ratio is defined in eq 3 a positive wave height is defined as the wave height of a regular wave and a negative wave height refers to the significant wave height of an irregular wave this table indicates the following features 1 the controlled dlc without seismic loads is dominated by the extreme wind speed dlc 6 1a model ewm in which the turbine is parked but attacked by a misaligned wind and large irregular waves the irregular waves with h s 10 12 m producing large wave forces on the support structure is the major reason to control the steel design moreover for the dlc 6 1 of the iec 61400 3 a yaw misalignment of up to 15 using the steady ewm or a mean yaw misalignment of 8o using the turbulent ewm must be imposed in this study the latter was used and this 8 yaw misalignment did cause a serious problem for the support structure due to a large amount of torsion in the vertical direction 2 for the case without seismic loads 34 of the steel design weight is controlled by the power production dlc 2 1 plus the occurrence of a fault dlc 2 1 requires simulating a control system fault or loss of the electrical network we set the three blades to go out of control after 300 s of the simulation which means that the pitch angles of the three blades were under control before 300 s and were subsequently fixed at the angles of the 300th second fig 7 shows the hub wind forces under dlc 2 1 which shows the blades sustain considerably large forces after 300 s this is because when the fault blades stop at small pitch angles due to a weak turbulence wind the blade forces will increase significantly when a strong turbulence wind attacks after a weak one although this situation occurs randomly it is quite possible that faulty blades can be subjected to these large forces 3 dlc 11 2 comprises a superposition of the earthquake and a shut down procedure possibly triggered by the earthquake we set the emergency shutdown to occur 15 s after the beginning of the earthquake the fast analysis results indicate that the emergency shutdown produced a big jump force at the hub but this force generated from the normal wind profile combined with the seismic load still did not dominate the steel design proposed in this paper however this force generated from the emergency shutdown was highly dependent on the blade data and control system so it cannot be ignored in the analysis of owt support structures it was also noted that slowing the pitch rate during the emergency shutdown can significantly reduce the jump in the wind force 4 for the case with seismic loads the earthquake dlc 11 3 plus grid loss parked standing still or idling also did not significantly control the results for the steel design since the blades are parked for dlc 11 3 the wind forces from the blades are small due to the strong wind the wave forces are large in this case but they still have less influence than the blade wind forces at the highest owt location during the dlc 11 1 power production under consideration in the current analysis 5 the wind speed of the controlled dlc is not often at the maximum working speed of 25 m s but rather is near the rated speed of 11 3 m s especially in the case of the analyses with seismic loads this is because the small pitch angle of the three blades has to be set to handle large left forces so the object rated power can be reached but the wind force acting on the support structure from the three blades will also be large this condition shows the controlled loading cases can be complicated and suggests that one should include all the possible wind speeds and wave conditions in the analysis 4 3 the effect of earthquake peak ground acceleration and soil liquefaction since the analysis and design results are complicated and are coupled with the wind wave and seismic loads simplified useful parameters should be used to discuss the parametric study we therefore used the following two parameters to represent the steel design result due to seismic loads the first parameter s e q is the ratio of the total steel design weight with seismic loads over that without seismic loads 4 s e q w e q w n o n e q where w e q and w n o n e q are the total steel weight of the support structure at the final design stage with and without seismic loads respectively this ratio can be used to understand the increase of the total steel design weight due to the earthquake effect the other parameter t r e q l o a d is the total steel weight ratio due to the dlc with the seismic load as follows 5 t r e q l o a d r e q l o a d where r e q l o a d is the steel weight ratio r load in eq 3 of the seismic load this parameter can be used to determine what percentage of the steel weight is controlled by seismic loads the changes in the design results for the above two parameters with the earthquake pgas are shown in figs 8 and 9 which indicate the following features it is noted that the dominant period t s in fig 2 of the earthquake is set to 0 5625 s which is in a normal t s range for long period earthquakes such as near fault effect we will discuss them in section 4 5 1 although the pga of the earthquake is not large for example 0 28 0 32 g there are still some structural members that are controlled by the seismic loads but the increase in the steel weight controlled by the seismic loads is very small this is because the mass of the owt support structure is not large so the inertia forces generated from the seismic acceleration are still much smaller than the wind and wave forces it is also noted that this condition can be found for high raised steel building structures that are often dominated by the wind load but is not the case for small or mediate scale seismic loads another important reason for the steel weight being small is that the main frequency range of seismic loads is much larger than the first mode natural frequencies of owt support structures so the resonance or amplification of seismic loads is not obvious 2 when the pga of the earthquake is between 0 38 and 0 44 g more than 20 of the steel weight and even as much as 40 of the steel weight with a 20 m soil liquefaction are controlled by the dlcs of the seismic loads however the percentage increase in the steel weight is not more than 5 which means that the seismic loads at this pga range are still not much larger than those for the original dlcs specified in iec 61400 3 the reason for this can be found in fig 10 which shows the total base shear force of the seismic load with a pga of 0 38 g and a 20 m soil liquefaction the total irregular wave force applied to the structure under dlc 6 1a and the wind force at the hub under dlc 2 1 this figure indicates that the wave force of dlc 6 1a is larger than the seismic force under a pga of 0 38 g and a 20 m soil liquefaction and the hub wind force applied at the most influential location can be about 1 2 of the maximum seismic force 3 when the pga of the seismic loads is large such as 0 52 g almost all of the member design is controlled by the seismic loads and the percentage increase in the total steel design weight is more than 20 while it is near 40 under the 20 m soil liquefaction the sudden increase in the total steel design weight as shown in fig 9 is due to the overly large seismic loads applied to the owt moreover such a large pga on the seabed requires large seismic loads to transmit along the deep soil as shown in fig 4 where the acceleration at each soil layer with a 0 52 g pga is always much larger than those with other smaller pgas it should be noted that the owt project should be seriously considered for a region with a required design seismic pga over 0 5 g 4 a significantly conservative soil liquefaction condition is set in this study where the soil at a 20 m depth is liquefied this condition does control the required steel design result compared to that without soil liquefaction fig 11 shows the total base shear forces under the earthquakes with pgas of 0 28 g and 0 38 g in the frequency domain using the fast fourier transform fft this figure indicates that the natural frequencies of the liquefied cases are lower than the non liquefied ones due to low structural stiffness and the natural frequency of the second mode which is close to the major frequency of the seismic load cannot be ignored in the analysis since the soil liquefaction effect during earthquakes cannot be ignored especially for a large pga case the deep pile foundation should be necessary and the jacket type owt often contains group long piles that are good resistance to soil liquefaction 4 4 the effect of the tuned mass damper tmd tmd can be used to reduce the vibration of the owt support structure so this section investigates the efficiency of a tmd to reduce the first mode vibration during earthquakes when the mass ratio μ between the tmd and the owt support structure is set the stiffness k tmd and damping c tmd of this single tmd can be designed as follows sadek et al 1997 6 ω t m d ω 1 1 μ φ 1 ξ μ φ 1 μ φ and ξ t m d φ ξ 1 μ μ 1 μ where ξ is the first mode damping ratio φ is the amplitude of the first mode vibration for a unit modal participation factor computed at the location of the tmd ω t m d is the optimal frequency of the tmd and ξ t m d is the optimal damping ratio of the tmd then the optimal stiffness and damping of the tmd are 7 k t m d m t m d ω t m d 2 and c t m d 2 m t m d ω t m d ξ t m d we put the tmd on the tower top of the above designed owt support structure where the optimal steel sections are determined under the dlcs in tables 2 and 3 with the seismic pga of 0 52 g without soil liquefaction the first mode natural frequency of the owt support structure is 0 29474 hz ω 1 1 8519 rad s under the natural frequency finite element analysis the tmd parameters are μ 1 04 ξ 3 φ 1 342 ω t m d 1 7732 rad s ξ t m d 26 28 k tmd 62 887 kn m and damping c tmd 18 64 kn s m fig 12 shows the stress ratios of the steel design for the main columns diagonals and piles changing with the material property number while the smaller number represents the lower vertical coordinate the stress ratio of the steel design is defined as the actual member stress over the capacity stress of the member and the ratio larger than one means the section has failed this figure indicates the following features 1 except diagonals the stress ratios of other members including towers columns and piles with the tmd are always much smaller than those without the tmd even for 20 m soil liquefaction the natural frequency decreases from 0 29474 hz without soil liquefaction to 0 2801 hz with 20 m soil liquefaction since this frequency change is not large the vibration can still be damped with the tmd for its properties without including the soil liquefaction effect it is noted that the four strong piles of 70 m long and 2 m wide should be the main reason for not much reducing the natural frequency during 20 m soil liquefaction for diagonals the members at the bottom are little influenced by the tmd and the reason should be further investigation nevertheless a first mode tmd is efficient to reduce the vibration coupled from wind wave and seismic loads under the ultimate analysis 2 this figure indicates that soil liquefaction may slightly reduce the stress ratios for towers and columns and a little enlarge those for diagonals those slight deviations are due to the change in natural frequencies during soil liquefaction so the results of time history analyses with and without soil liquefaction will be different the difference between the components of the superstructure are not large however the stress ratio of foundation piles can be largely different for the cases with and without soil liquefaction because the pile moments and forces should be largely increased near the location of the soil liquefaction surface 20 m below the seabed in the current analysis 4 5 the effect of different dominant periods ts of earthquakes except the pga another important parameter of the seismic load is the dominant period t s as shown in fig 2 while t s is often within the range of 0 4 0 8 s for earthquakes with long periods t s will be large but this condition is often due to the near fault earthquakes which can contain a single peak acceleration with a period over 2 s except near fault earthquakes although t s larger than 1 s is not common this section still studies the effect of t s over this value fig 13 shows the required steel weight in the api optimal steel design changing with the dominant period t s of various earthquakes under the pga of 0 32 and 0 36 g this figure indicates 1 the steel weight required for the optimal design increases with t s and the relationship between them is greater than linear the reason is because a large t s causes the seismic dominant frequency to approach the natural frequency of owt support structure which produces large vibrations 2 for earthquakes with t s smaller than 0 8 s and pga smaller than 0 36 g the increase of the steel weight in the design with and without soil liquefaction is not obvious since the major part of the steel design is still controlled by the wind and wave loads 3 when t s is large such as more than 1 s the design of the steel structure due to seismic loads will become more and more important because the pga required for most common seismic belts such as taiwan about 0 32 g may greatly increase the required steel weight of the owt support structures in addition if the seabed is sandy soil soil liquefaction is also very important in this case 4 typically t s is smaller than 1 s for most of seismic zones but near fault earthquakes often contain a large impulse with a period of more than 2 s since the impulse period is close to the natural frequency of the owt support structure this single impulse may result in a substantial increase in the required steel design weight thus this topic should be further studied 5 conclusions in this paper owt support structures were subjected to seismic loads using the finite element method with the ssi effect and the api steel design is then used to determine the optimal steel design in the finite element model beam elements were used to simulate the superstructure and piles while p y t z and q z elements were used to simulate the soil using the response spectrum and the pga of earthquakes we adopted the simqke program to generate the seismic accelerations of an artificial earthquake in the time domain the shake 91 program was then used to generate the acceleration field in each soil layer where the acceleration fields were integrated with the displacement fields applied to one end of the p y t z and q z elements we used a conservative method to conduct the soil liquefaction analysis to initially investigate this effect for owt support structures during earthquakes in a sandy soil region the wind wave and ocean current loads based on iec 61400 3 were also coupled with the seismic loads to analyze owt support structures the nrel 5 mw baseline owt with the jacket type supported structure under iec 61400 3 class i a were analyzed the analysis and design results indicate that the controlled dlc without seismic loads was mainly dominated by the ewm of dlc 6 1a in which the turbine was parked but attacked by large irregular waves producing large forces on the support structure the dlc 2 1 power production plus occurrence of fault controls about 1 3 of the steel design weight this is because when the fault blades stop at small pitch angles due to a weak turbulence wind the blade forces will increase greatly following an attack by a strong turbulence wind for the case with seismic loads the emergency shutdown of dlc 11 2 produced a big jump force at the hub and this dlc often does not dominate the steel design however if the jump force is large one can change the control system to slow down the pitch rate during the emergency shutdown to reduce the jump of the wind force dlc 11 3 is defined as a condition in which the parked blades are under a strong wind and waves with a seismic load since the blades are parked the wind forces from the blades are small although the wave forces are large in this case they still have less influence than the blade wind forces at the highest owt location during the dlc 11 1 power production for earthquakes with pgas smaller than 0 32 g and the dominant period t s smaller than 1 s there may be some structural members that are controlled by the seismic loads but the increase in the steel weight controlled by the seismic loads is very small this is because the resonance or amplification of seismic loads is not obvious due to the big difference between the main frequency range of the seismic loads and the first natural owt support structure frequencies when the seismic dominant period t s is more than 1 s although this is not common in most of seismic zones the design of the steel structure due to seismic loads will be important and earthquakes with pga near or over 0 32 g may greatly increase the required steel weight of the owt support structures in addition if the seabed is sandy soil soil liquefaction cannot be ignored in this case when the pga of the seismic loads was over 0 52 g almost all the members were controlled by the seismic loads and the percentage increase in the total steel design weight was more than 20 while it was nearly 40 under the 20 m soil liquefaction we therefore suggest that owt projects should be avoided in this strong earthquake zone a significantly conservative soil liquefaction condition was set in this study which does control the required steel design result compared to that without soil liquefaction but the increase in the total required steel design weight was still not significant for earthquakes with pgas less than 0 38 g this paper also indicates that a first mode tmd is efficient to reduce the vibration coupled from wind wave and seismic loads under the ultimate analysis the deep piles of the jacket type support structure cause that the natural frequency change is not large during soil liquefaction and the vibration can still be damped with the tmd for its properties without including the soil liquefaction effect 
22639,the collapse behaviours of ship structures are usually validated by testing their small scale models for thin wall structures the scale models obtained by complete geometrical similarity might not be economical or practical in test the present study aims to figure out an approach to determine the dimensions of small scale models which have similar collapse behaviours and load carrying capacity with full scale prototypes for this purpose the partial similarity methods are used to design the dimensions of scale stiffened panels considering the influence of collapse modes which could be employed for the experiment in laboratory condition the proposed approaches assume that three principle parameters dominate the buckling behaviours of stiffened panels including plate column and torsional slenderness which are considered as determinate variables in the analyses of partial similarity methods the stiffened panels under uniaxial longitudinal compression are simulated by finite element method the dimensional and similitude analyses of stiffened panels with flanged profiles and flat bars are also performed the ultimate strength and collapse mode are compared between the small and full scale models from the comparison the small scale stiffened panels designed by the partial similarity methods could reasonably represent the collapse behaviours of full scale models keywords

stiffened panels to guarantee the safety of ships and human lives five types of methods are generally used to evaluate the ultimate strength of ship structures including the simple closed form formulations initiated by caldwell 1965 simplified element methods such as idealized structural unit method isum ueda and rashed 1984 incremental iterative method firstly proposed by smith 1977 and employed in iacs csr h requirement 2014 common struct 2014 finite element fe method consisting of both implicit static analysis and explicit dynamic analysis xu et al 2017a and experimental methods xu and guedes soares 2013 since researchers normally can t afford the time and financial costs to test actual ship structures the small scale box girder e g gordo guedes soares gordo and guedes soares 2009 and dow s 1 3 scale frigate model dow 1991 or stiffened panel models xu and guedes soares 2012 have been frequently adopted to test the pre and post collapse behaviours as the simulation of actual ship structures with respect to the geometrical range of selected stiffened panels to conduct compression tests or fe analyses paik et al paik and thayamballi 2007 introduced four kinds of structural modelling including a one stiffener span plate stiffener combination model b one stiffener two spans plate stiffener combination model c multiple stiffeners one span stiffened panel model between transverse frames d multiple stiffeners spans stiffened panel model generally if the rotational restraints along the transverse frames have ignorable influences on the ultimate strength the one span models could be effective and available otherwise two span models are considered more realistic since they can take account for the rotational restraints of two adjacent inter frame stiffened panels along the transverse frames for the purpose of simplifying analytical conditions and reducing computational resources one stiffener stiffened plates were adopted to assess the ultimate compression capacity such as wang and moan 1997 xu et al 2013a adopted two bays spans stiffened panels with the periodical and symmetric boundary conditions to assess the ultimate strength which could automatically consider the appropriate buckling shapes and interactional influences between the adjacent plates and stiffeners which may allow to reduce the uncertainties of modelling experimental results of scale models should reflect and validate the buckling modes and ultimate strength of actual ship structures for stiffened panels with different dimension distributions between stiffeners and attached plates predominantly in plane compressive loads could produce different failure modes which could be categorized into five types in csr h 2014 common struct 2014 as follows a elasto plastic collapse which is gross yielding b beam column buckling mode namely stiffener induced collapse without rotation of stiffeners c tripping buckling mode resulting in subsequent unloading of stiffened panels d web local buckling of stiffeners made of flanged profiles or flat bars e plate buckling mode for transversely stiffened panels the lowest value among various ultimate loads assessed from these five failure modes is regarded as the ultimate strength of stiffened panels the structural response is mainly dependent on the equilibrium equations constitutive relations and compatibility conditions which is the basic theory of similitude laws jones 1974 the complete similarity method is a good option to design the small scale models however for thin wall structures the length and width of stiffened panel members are normally much larger than the thickness it may be not practical or economical to design a small scale model with complete geometrical similarity due to the limitations of financial cost steel plate thickness and capacity of test machine young 1971 hence the dimensional directional analysis with different scale ratios in length and thickness directions was improved araneda 1996 for example garbatov et al 2015 employed this similarity method to assess the ultimate strength of box girder nevertheless the authors assumed the same similarity ratio of bending moment between elastic and elasto plastic stages because it could not take account of the material and geometric nonlinearities properties in the collapse process the closed form empirical formulae are also useful tools to design the small scale models for tests lin 1985 paik thayamball paik and thayamballi 1997 zhang khan zhang and khan 2009 and kim et al 2017 2018 developed the assessment formulae of ultimate strength for stiffened panels under compression which only include plate and column slenderness however it was found that the torsional rigidity is also very important for the tripping buckling of stiffener xu et al 2018 the ultimate strength of the full and small scale models having the same plate slenderness and column slenderness might be very different xu et al 2013b especially under tripping buckling conditions for the scaling of stiffened panels under longitudinal compression the various collapse modes are determined by three types of slenderness later demonstrated in the paper it is vital and necessary to assure that the relevant slenderness of the full and small scale models are the same because each slenderness could differentiate the response of ship structures that they are also interacted with each other when the geometrical and material nonlinearities are considered the present paper aims to figure out practical methods to design the dimensional configurations of small scale models for testing which mainly focus on dimensional and similitude analyses of stiffened panels subjected to compression loads with considering the buckling behaviours the partial similitude approaches are used to design the small scale stiffened panels using fe analysis the stiffened panels having various buckling modes are modelled to investigate the relationships of collapse behaviours and load carrying capacity between the small and full scale models the suggested similarity method is able to ensure that the buckling mode and ultimate strength between the small and full scale models are similar which is practical in the design of testing specimens 2 dimensional descriptions and similitude requirements the stiffened panel normally consists of attached plate and stiffener issc 2012 committee ⅲ 1 2012 report of spe 2012 introduced a series of two spans bays continuous stiffened panels in bulk carrier and vlcc very large crude carrier see fig 1 the combination of one stiffener and attached plate in fig 2 is cut from the corresponding continuous stiffened panels in fig 1 as illustration of different types of stiffeners the dimensions of the stiffeners and attached plates are kept the same with those in table 1 thus the symbol s represents breadth of the plate attached to the stiffener in general tee angle and flat bars have different geometrical cross section characteristics in fig 2 the difference of tee and angle bars is that the flange plates are whether or not symmetric to the webs which have similar pre collapse behaviours and ultimate strength but their post ultimate strength behaviours are different flat bars without flange may lead to different collapse behaviours because the torsional moments of inertia of flat bars are very smaller than that of angle tee bars the present paper mainly focuses on the difference of load carrying capacity of stiffened panels with different scales which would provide some guidelines for designing the testing specimens in the future hence two types of stiffeners tee and flat bars are used in the analyses as shown in table 1 which includes three different dimensions denoting the slender intermediate and stocky stiffeners the attached plates with the length of 2550 mm and width of 850 mm have the thickness of 33 mm 16 mm and 9 5 mm the different dimensional combinations of the plates and stiffeners intend to account for different collapse modes including beam column tripping web local and elasto plastic collapse the scaling laws are generally used to develope the small scale stiffened panels for experimental purpose however it is difficult to fulfil complete similitude requirements in the design of testing specimens hence the partial similitude method by relaxing some of similarity requirements is commonly adopted however which might cause the change of collapse modes between the models with different scales eventually causing different ultimate strength in consideration of various collapse modes plate slenderness column slenderness and torsional slenderness dominating the collapse behaviours of stiffened panels are included in the similarity analyses three types of similitude strategies with keeping predominant parameters the same are developed which are similarity method ⅰ with the same column slenderness λ and plate slenderness β method ⅱ with the same β and torsional slendernss λ ω and method ⅲ with the same λ β and λ ω the priority of similitude strategy is to ensure that the full and small scale models have the same collapse mode and then similar load carrying capacity due to the dimensional interactions the principle parameters λ β and λ ω and dimensions of stiffener and attached plate might have different scales the plate slenderness β is associated with the width and thickness of attached plate for the stiffened panels with flanged profiles the column slenderness λ and torsional slenderness λ ω are adjusted by changing the dimensions of attached plates webs or flanges while for the stiffened panels with flat bars only the dimensions of attached plates and webs could be changed to satisfy the requirements of λ and λ ω these methods may be a little complex and not easily generalised in some cases but they still would be helpful and valuable to establish the relationship of the ultimate strength of stiffened panels between the full and small scale models they could be utilized to design scale stiffened panels for compression tests which could to some degree reflect the collapse behaviours of full scale models during designing the dimensions of testing specimens the small models are scaled initially by the complete geometrical similarity with equal scale ratio of 5 in length width and thickness according to the capacity of the test machine considering the fabrication the length and width of the small scale stiffened panels are generally designed to meet the complete similitude requirements however the thickness series of steel plates produced by steel plants might be not the same with assumed value by complete similitude analysis in this circumstance the calculated thickness of steel plates is adjusted to that is closest to the standard value by the rounding up and rounding down as presented in table 2 the maximum difference between the adjacent normalized thicknesses of the thin plates is around 2 mm hence the attached plates web and flange plates with 1 mm different thicknesses are also simulated to investigate the influences of thickness on the collapse behaviours and load carrying capacity of the small scale stiffened panels the dimensions of the small scale models are showed in table 2 in which the notations of the stiffened panels are explained as follows t i and f i indicate full scale stiffened panel prototypes with different types of stiffeners in which t and f represent the tee and flat bars respectively i means the stiffened panels with different dimensions as presented in table 1 t i s j and f i s j s indicates different small scale stiffened panels s 0 denotes the approximate scale models with close integral plate thickness s ij s ⅱj and s ⅲj indicate the small scale stiffened panels with the partial similarity methods ⅰ ⅱ and ⅲ respectively j equalling to 1 2 or 3 represents the dimension change of both plate and web both plate and flange all members 3 nonlinear fe analysis 3 1 models in fe analysis three coupons have been longitudinally cut from a steel plate made of ah32 the uniaxial tension tests were conducted to obtain the material mechanical properties under the room temperature 20 c the velocity of imposed loading was 1 mm min by the displacement control method the stress strain curves of material were automatically recorded by an extensometer during tests which are plotted in fig 3 b the nominal elastic modulus yield strength and ultimate tensile strength at 20 c are 206 gpa 322 mpa and 486 mpa respectively possion s ratio is generally assumed as constant 0 3 both attached plates and stiffeners are modelled by four node element shell 181 with reduced integration in ansys software see fig 1 b to precisely capture the yielding progress through shell sections the shell element with five integration points through the thickness is selected both geometrical and material nonlinearities are taken into consideration in the nonlinear fe analyses the true material mechanical properties are defined by piecewise linear stress strain curves and multilinear isotropic hardening miso with von mises criteria is chosen to model the plasticity behaviours of the stress strain curve which was derived from three engineering stress strain curves measured by in house uniaxial tension tests as shown in fig 3 b the fe models with two stiffeners for different configurations of boundary conditions were discussed in ref xu et al 2013a and were adopted by tanaka et al 2014 for the collapse behaviour analyses of stiffened panels under longitudinal compression for simplification the stiffened panels with two and four stiffeners have been also used in the compressive tests xu and guedes soares 2012 ghavami and khedmati 2006 gordo and guedes soares 2011 moreover the present paper mainly focuses on the influences of dimensions and similitude methods on the collapse behaviours of stiffened panels for future compression tests hence the stiffened panels having two stiffeners with periodic boundary conditions are adopted in the present comparison analyses because the mesh setting should balance the precision of results and proper computational resources the mesh size is associated with the ratio of element size to thickness of shell element usually at least 5 2009 committee ⅲ 1 2009 based on the convergence analysis of mesh size in ref xu et al 2013a the width of attached plates bounded by adjacent longitudinal stiffeners and transverse frames is divided into 10 elements meanwhile the mesh number is set as 6 for the height of web and width of flange plates for attached plates the aspect ratios of elements on plates are near to 1 furthermore the newton raphson iterative method with large displacement static option in ansys code is selected to calculate the ultimate strength under compressive displacement loads the maximum and minimum numbers of substeps are 100 and 5 the automatic time stepping with default convergence criterion is adopted 3 2 calculation of principle parameters three types of slenderness are considered as the principal parameters that dominant the collapse behaviours of stiffened panels under in plane compressive loads the formulae of plate slenderness β and column slenderness λ of stiffened panels are given as follows 1 plate slenderness β s t p σ y e 2 column slenderness λ l π r σ y e 3 radius of gyration r i a the torsional slenderness of stiffened panels λ ω denotes the influential parameter of tripping or web local buckling modes which is given by ref choung et al 2012 4 λ ω σ y σ ω σ y a i 0 2 π 2 e i ω μ ω l 2 g i t where μ ω is assumed as 1 for continuous stiffened panels σ ω is the elastic torsional buckling stress of centrally compressed members polar radius of gyration i 0 i y i z a warping moment of inertia i ω a ω n 2 d a ω n ω s a ω s d a a ω s 0 s ρ s d s ρ s is the perpendicular distance from the shear centre to mid plane section of stiffened panel members for open thin walled combinations of associated plates and stiffeners i t i 1 n i i t i 1 n b i t i 3 3 details on sub parameters in eqs 1 4 can be referred to fig 2 3 3 boundary conditions table 3 presents the periodic and symmetric boundary conditions of 1 1 2 1 bays spans stiffened panels in which the transverse and vertical axes are y and z while the longitudinal axis is x as illustrated in fig 1 the asterisk indicates that for the nodes at the same coordinate value their degrees of freedom dof are identical in order to keep the deformations of opposite sides of stiffened panels the same c dx means that the imposed in plane loads along the transverse edges have same displacements c u means the nodes keeping uniform in plane movements ship structures generally consist of longitudinal girders and transverse frames to sustain the global hull girder bending loads in the direction of ship length normally longitudinal girders and transverse frames are assumed strong enough to resist the lateral deflections of attached plates the present study mainly focus on the similitude analysis of the stiffeners hence the dimensional influences of the longitudinal girders and transverse frames are not considered instead applying reasonable boundary conditions is adopted which are θ x 0 u z 0 for transverse frames and θ y 0 u z 0 for longitudinal girders as shown in table 3 due to the effects of adjacent plates and stiffeners the boundary conditions of longitudinal edges relate with the positions of stiffened panels in hull structures amdahl according to iacs csr h requirement 2014 common struct 2014 the in plane transverse direction along the longitudinal unloaded edge b1 b4 in fig 1 is free to move but is forced to remain straight due to the surrounding structures and neighboring plates it is possible that the mode of deflections is symmetric or asymmetric which depends on many aspects such initial imperfections load conditions and dimensional combinations of stiffeners and attached plates actually it is unknown what kind of deformations symmetric or asymmetric is the actual collapse shape in advance according to the comparison of symmetric and periodic boundary conditions in ref xu et al 2013a the correct behaviour as a stiffened panel having the initial deflection of buckling mode can be obtained by the periodic boundary condition which gives a logical modelling to continuous stiffened panels and can consider both the odd and even number of half waves and thus is considered to have a smaller model uncertainty for the analysis of continuous stiffened panel hence the longitudinal unloaded edges a1 a4 and b1 b4 have symmetric constraints while the periodically continuous boundary conditions are adopted on transverse edges a1 b1 including c1 c6 and e1 f1 a4 b4 including d1 d6 and e4 f4 as illustrated in fig 1 and table 3 in addition the longitudinal stiffness of transverse frames also affects the simulation of boundary conditions when the transverse frames are rigid enough to resist any rotational deformation the rotation dofs around transverse axis along the transverse frames are constrained while the longitudinal displacement dofs are free with the same displacements otherwise the slender transverse frames would deform with deflections of stiffeners hence bc1 as default and bc2 as additional boundary conditions are designed to investigate and compare the effects of different constraints along the transverse frames on the collapse behaviours the difference between bc1 and bc2 is whether or not the longitudinal rotations of the transverse frame stiffener intersection e2 f2 e3 f3 are restrained the constraint conditions of bc1 and bc2 for continuous stiffened panels are given in table 3 3 4 geometrical initial imperfections fabrication and welding would cause the geometrical initial distortions which significantly affect the collapse behaviours and load carrying capacity of ship structures the actual initial imperfections have complex and diverse spatial variations it is generally adopt the measured initial imperfections in the fe analysis the statistics analysis of measured data shows that the geometrical imperfections could be expressed as fourier series kmiecik et al 1995 the equivalent formulae of initial imperfections of eqs 5 8 are also recommended in issc 2012 committee ⅲ 1 2012 report of spe 2012 to assess the ultimate strength of stiffened panels and hull girder moreover the present study mainly focuses on the relative analyses of similitude between full and small scale models hence the equivalent initial geometrical imperfections are assumed as the superimposition of deflections of plates column type and sideway deflections of stiffeners which are expressed as follows hughes and paik 2010 initial deflection of local plate 5 w 0 p l a 0 sin m π x l sin π y s b 0 sin π x l sin π y b column type deflection of stiffener 6 w 0 s b 0 sin π x l sin π y b sideways deflection of stiffener 7 v s c 0 z h w sin π x l for average level the amplitudes of the above initial deformation formulae are given 8 a 0 0 1 β 2 t p and b 0 c 0 0 0015 l and m means the buckling number of the associated plate between adjacent transverse frames and always defined as a minimum integer satisfying the following equation 9 l s m m 1 however as illustrated in fig 4 for the simply supported rectangular plate subjected to axial compression loads when the imposed half wave shape of initial imperfections in formula eq 5 coincides with the buckling mode there exist abrupt changes at the aspect ratios m m 1 in the curves of ultimate strength versus buckling half wave number ueda and yao 1985 normally the difference of ultimate strength between adjacent buckling half wave numbers gradually decreases as the aspect ratio of plate and then buckling half wave number increase at the same time for initially deflected plate the half wave number in the stable deflection mode above the buckling loads is often one or two larger than the buckling mode for the stiffened panels eq 5 is appropriate to calculate the initial imperfections for local plate with integral aspect ratio l s but when the aspect ratio of local plate is close to m m 1 the influences of different half wave numbers on the collapse behaviours of stiffened panel are slightly for column induced collapse but significantly for plate induces failure xu et al 2017b thus in order to avoid the sharp change of ultimate strength due to the difference of assumed half wave numbers the initial imperfections including symmetric and asymmetric shapes is recommended to replace eq 5 e g eq 10 for aspect ratio near 6 in ref xu et al 2013a a 0 m is set as 0 01t p instead of a 0 0 1 β 2 t p but there exist great differences between the two amplitudes when β 2 is much different from 0 1 thus 0 01t p may be not suitable under some conditions and in this paper a 0m is assumed as the value of a 0 3 0 1 β 2 t p 3 because of the superimposition of three buckling half wave shapes this amplitude gives intermediate ultimate strength between the results with the two adjacent buckling half wave numbers besides the aspect ratio of local plate 10 w 0 p l m 2 4 a 0 m sin m π x l sin π y s b 0 sin π x l sin π y b because the eigenvalue buckling analysis for complex structures always gives local buckling modes that are different from the assumed equivalent initial imperfections the formulae of geometrical initial imperfections eqs 5 10 are calculated as prescribed displacements which are imposed on the corresponding nodes of stiffened panel members by apdl ansys program design language afterwards based on the solved initial deformations the longitudinal in plane displacement loads are applied on the end transverse cross sections of stiffened panels to evaluate the ultimate strength through newton raphson solution 4 analysis of results since the geometrical similitude does not completely fulfil the requirements when the collapse mode is account for it is very important that the adopted specimens should include various collapse modes to consider the influences of buckling hence before the investigation of similitude the numerical simulations have been conducted for the full scale models to make sure that include various collapse modes see fig 5 and table 1 fig 5 shows the collapse deformations of the stiffened panels with tee and flat bars in which web local buckling mode occur for stiffened panels with flat bars due to smaller torsional rigidity moreover in some cases it seems to combine different collapse modes that is not easy to distinguish which buckling mode is predominant from the multiple failure modes e g model t 2 has the multiple buckling modes including beam column and web local buckling modes in fig 5 b model t 3 has the multiple buckling modes with tripping and web local buckling mode in fig 5 c 4 1 ultimate strength of small scale models the small scale model with complete similarity method generally has the same collapse behaviour with the corresponding full scale model the small scale models t i s 0 and f i s 0 with partial similarity method lead to slightly different ultimate strength from the full scale models see table 2 whether the collapse behaviours between the small and full scale models are similar or not is highly dependent on the dimensional differences between them the maximum difference of their ultimate strength is around 5 for the stiffened panels under consideration in table 2 this difference is acceptable which means the partial similarity method is promising to design small scale models under required conditions it is possible that the small scale models with partial similarity method could represent the collapse behaviours of their full scale prototypes however the relationships of the dimensions between full and small scale models are uncertain when the partial similarity method is adopted namely there exist different dimensional combinations for small scale models that still all comply with partial similarity method hence the influences of partial similarity method on the collapse behaviours will be investigated considering various the collapse modes and dimensional combination of the stiffened panels 4 2 dimensional and similitude analysis considering buckling mode the collapse behaviours of stiffened panels including material and geometrical nonlinearities are complex for simplification there are several closed form empirical formulae including plate slenderness β and column slenderness λ for the assessment of ultimate strength of stiffened panels using numerical and experimental data lin 1985 and paik thayamball paik and thayamballi 1997 developed the assessment expressions by the least square method which only differ in the coefficients table 4 as given by 11 σ u σ y 1 c 0 c 1 λ 2 c 2 β 2 c 3 λ 2 β 2 c 4 λ 4 zhang khan zhang and khan 2009 derived a semi analytical formula based on the comprehensive study on the ultimate strength of stiffened panels subjected to uniaxial compression loads which is expressed as the following form 12 σ u σ y 1 β 0 28 1 1 λ 3 2 for λ 2 and take β 1 0 if β 1 0 kim et al 2017 2018 developed another form of closed form empirical formulation to assess the ultimate strength of stiffened panels under longitudinal compression as follows 13 σ u σ y 1 0 8884 e λ 2 1 0 4121 e β for 0 5 λ 5 0 xu et al 2018 also proposed an empirical formula to predict ultimate strength of stiffened panels under combined longitudinal compression and lateral pressure which is given by 14 σ u σ y 1 c 0 c 1 λ c 2 β c 3 λ β c 4 λ 2 c 5 β 2 c 6 λ 2 β 2 c 7 λ 3 c 8 β 3 c 9 λ 3 β 3 c 10 λ 4 it was found that the ultimate strength and collapse modes of the full and small scale models might be different even when their plate slenderness and column slenderness are the same xu et al 2013b the buckling of plate and tripping of stiffener generally interact each other thus the additional torsional rigidity of stiffener is very important for stiffened panels with tripping buckling mode xu et al 2018 however all these above formulae only include plate slenderness β and column slenderness λ but exclude torsional rigidity of stiffener which may not be neglected in some buckling modes such as tripping buckling mode in consideration of torsional slenderness λ ω the designed similarity methods ⅰ ⅱ and ⅲ are employed to compare and investigate their respective effects on the collapse behaviours of stiffened panels including different failure modes and boundary conditions along transverse frames the dimensional and similitude analyses will be separately conducted for different collapse modes next 4 2 1 beam column buckling mode according to eqs 1 4 the stiffened panel with the same principle slenderness λ β and λ ω could include various combinations of geometrical dimensions which might give different results the increase of web height and flange width could enhance the ultimate strength of stiffened panels with beam column buckling mode as expected from table 5 for small scale stiffened panels with tee bars the ultimate strength of stiffened panel models t 1 s i1 and t 1 s i2 with similarity method ⅰ is close to the full scale stiffened panel model t 1 because of similar plate slenderness β and column slenderness λ however the ultimate strength between models t 1 s ⅱ1 and t 1 s ⅱ2 with similarity method ⅱ is different the influence of column slenderness λ on the ultimate strength is larger than that of torsional slenderness λ ω for beam column buckling mode since the same torsional slenderness λ ω changes greater amount of web height than flange width the small scale model t 1 s ⅱ1 has much larger height of web and thus smaller column slenderness λ than that of model t 1 s ⅱ2 which cause that their results are more different the dimensions of stiffened panel model t 1 s ⅲ3 with similarity method ⅲ could be considered as a compromised solution relative to the dimensional variation of web and flange in similarity methods ⅰ and ⅱ model t 1 s ⅲ3 give intermediate ultimate strength for the stiffened panels with flat bars due to the absence of flange plates the similarity method of assessing the ultimate strength with error from small to large may be similarity methods ⅲ ⅰ and ⅱ for this type of collapse mode column slenderness λ is the first priority parameter to be considered during scaling full model similarity method ⅱ without considering column slenderness may lead to different buckling mode and then cause large difference of ultimate strength thus it is not recommended for stiffened panels with beam column buckling mode fig 6 shows the average stress average strain curves for the stiffened panels and material as well as for attached plates and stiffeners separately which are denoted as p and s for the thick attached plates the longitudinal linear stiffness of stiffened panels is close to the elastic modulus of material and the structural moduli between the attached plates and stiffeners are almost the same with that of stiffened panels as expected for beam column buckling mode the longitudinal average stress of stiffeners rapidly decreases after collapse and the longitudinal average stress of stiffeners is much smaller than that of the attached plates the stiffeners buckle prior to attached plates which is classified as stiffener induced buckling mode for the small scale models t 1 s i1 t 1 s i1 and t 1 s ⅲ3 their respective stress strain curves of stiffened panels are similar which indicate that the buckling modes and equivalent stress distributions of the stiffened panels could be acceptably different from the full scale stiffened panel t 1 the ultimate strength with similarity methods ⅰ and ⅲ for the stiffened panels with tee and flat bars are close in which the maximum difference is 6 5 for the beam column buckling mode the plate slenderness β and column slenderness λ dominate the collapse behaviours of stiffened panels hence the similarity methods ⅰ and ⅲ could be employed to design the small scale stiffened panels within acceptable errors while similarity method ⅱ may induce large difference of buckling mode and ultimate strength 4 2 2 combined buckling modes for some stiffened panels there might exist combined buckling modes instead of single type of buckling mode in this circumstance the failure mode can not be separately classified as only one type which might combine beam column web local and tripping buckling modes the proportion of combined buckling modes always changes with the dimension distributions between attached plates and stiffeners and it s difficult to distinguish the predominant buckling mode from table 1 and fig 5 both full scale models t 2 and f 2 has combined buckling modes consisting of beam column and web local buckling modes while the buckling mode of full scale model t 3 is multiple buckling modes including tripping and web local buckling modes hence models t 2 and t 3 are selected to perform the dimensional and similitude analyses in this section regarding the combined buckling modes column slenderness λ or torsional slenderness λ ω may exert more significant impacts on the ultimate strength than each other which depends on the buckling mode components thus from table 6 the model t 2 s ⅱ2 with changing the width of flange has the largest difference of ultimate strength due to the lack of tripping buckling deformations but the model t 3 s i1 with adjusting the height of web gives relatively large different result due to the absence of beam column deflections in order to obtain the appropriate dimensions of small scale models it could be best to select the smallest difference of ultimate strength among the three similarity methods however though similarity method ⅲ with adjusting both the dimensions of web and flange plates maybe not give the closest ultimate strength for small scale models the differences of ultimate strength between full and small scale models are less than 7 2 which could be considered as acceptable error range from fig 7 the longitudinal average stress average strain curves of small scale stiffened panels with similarity ⅲ and their members are slightly different from the corresponding prototypical stiffened panels before collapse of stiffened panels for attached plates with slender and medium thickness e g t 2 s ⅲ3 and t 3 s ⅲ3 the elastic modulus of material is larger than the structural linear elastic stiffness which strongly depends on the thickness of attached plate the longitudinal average stress of stiffener is always larger than that of attached plate for combined buckling modes as the dimensions of attached plate and stiffener vary the buckling mode components are unstable and might gradually change to other buckling modes e g in fig 8 the model t 2 s ⅲ3 with the similar multiple buckling modes but the model t 3 s ⅲ3 with predominant tripping buckling mode either column slenderness λ or torsional slenderness λ ω may more obviously affect the ultimate strength with multiple buckling modes the similarity methods ⅰ ⅱ or ⅲ may give close ultimate strength within reasonable and acceptable errors which depends on the specific buckling mode components the longitudinal stresses of the stiffened panels between small and full scale models are also very similar to each other before collapse 4 2 3 web local buckling mode web local buckling mode often occurs for the stiffened panels with flat bars or with weak web and flange plate among these small scale models of stiffened panels the full scale model f 3 with medium thickness for web and attached plate have web local buckling mode at ultimate state herein from fig 9 a and table 7 the differences of ultimate strength among similarity methods ⅰ ⅱ and ⅲ are slightly but the similarity method ⅲ gives the closest results between small and full scale models the plate slenderness β could significantly but column slenderness λ and torsional slenderness λ ω slightly affect the mechanical behaviours of stiffened panels with web local buckling mode the buckling deformations between small and full scale models are slightly different without obviously affecting the ultimate strength 4 2 4 tripping buckling mode for the stiffened panels with flanged profiles and flat bars full scale models t 5 and f 5 with slender attached plates have tripping buckling mode at ultimate state from table 8 and fig 9 b in similarity method ⅰ adjusting the height of web may significantly influences the ultimate strength but changing the flange width of stiffener could lead to similar results hence for similarity method ⅰ there exists the uncertainty of relationship of ultimate strength between the small and full scale stiffened panels as illustrated in fig 10 a the buckling deformation of small scale model t 5 s i1 is similar with that of the full scale prototype t 5 but the ultimate strength between them is still different from fig 10 b for the stiffened panel f 5 s i1 with flat bars the different tripping slenderness λ ω may change the buckling mode to web local buckling mode and therefore induce large difference of ultimate strength at the same time similarity method ⅱ with changing the size of web and flange plate could mostly give similar ultimate strength with the full scale models which indicates that the dominate parameters for tripping buckling mode should be plate slenderness β and torsional slenderness λ ω similarity method ⅲ give intermediate results between similarity methods ⅰ and ⅱ for the stiffened panels with flanged profiles and even could give the closest ultimate strength for stiffened panels with flat bars 4 2 5 elasto plastic collapse with respect to stiffened panels with thick attached plates there may exist beam column buckling mode for slender stiffeners such as full scale models t 1 and f 1 or gross yielding failure mode for stocky stiffeners for full scale models t 4 and f 4 though the failure deformations seem like tripping or web local buckling deformations the most parts of the stiffened panels entry into plastic stage at ultimate state as illustrated in fig 5 d and at the same time their structural elastic moduli and ultimate strength are close to the elastic modulus and yield stress of material respectively hence the failure modes of models t 4 and f 4 with thick attached plates and stocky stiffeners should be approximately classified as elasto plastic collapse for elasto plastic collapse the relative small variations of dimensions of stiffeners may slightly influence the ultimate strength as indicated in table 9 thus the small scale models with three types of proposed similarity methods could give similar collapse behaviours as illustrated in fig 11 the relationships of longitudinal stress versus strain of attached plates are close to the material mechanical behaviours while the longitudinal stresses for different sizes of stiffeners are slightly different after collapse for stiffener induced failure mode thus similarity methods ⅰ ⅱ and ⅲ could be employed to scale model for elasto plastic collapse which could give similar collapse behaviours and close ultimate strength between small and full scale stiffened panels 4 3 influences of thickness of plates sometimes the thicknesses of small scale stiffened panel members may not meet the standard steel plate thickness series hence they are necessary to be adjusted in the process of fabricating the small scale models herein it s assumed that the small scale stiffened panel members including attached plate web and flange plates could increase the thickness of 1 mm based on the dimensions of small scale model t i s 0 f i s 0 to investigate the influences of variations of thickness on the ultimate strength the sensitivity analyses are also quantified by sensitivity coefficients defined as dimensionless partial derivatives which are given as follows 15 α i σ u t 1 t 2 t i δ t i t n σ u t 1 t 2 t i t n 2 δ t i t i σ u t 1 t 2 t i t n t i δ t i σ u t 1 t 2 t i δ t i t n where t i is the influential parameter which is the thickness of stiffened panel members as illustrated in fig 12 the variations of thickness for tee bars representing flanged profiles and flat bars give different influences on the ultimate strength which depend on the failure mode of the stiffened panels normally for most of buckling modes because the areas of web and flange are always much smaller than attached plate the thickness of attached plate has larger sensitivity coefficient than that of web and flange plates which indicates that the thickness variation of attached plate causes larger change of ultimate strength e g the maximum difference due to the thickness of attached plate is over 15 for models t 3 series at the same time for elasto plastic collapse the increase of thickness of stiffened panel members generally slightly affects the ultimate strength such as models t 4 and f 4 series however if the increase of attached plate thickness results in changing the buckling mode the change of plate thickness could significantly influence on the collapse strength as shown in fig 13 the buckling mode of model f 2 s 0 is web local buckling mode while corresponding model with increase 1 mm of attached plate thickness has beam column buckling mode because the web local buckling mode generates compression stress while the beam column buckling mode induces additional longitudinal bending tension stress which to some degree neutralizes the imposed compression loads thus the 1 mm increment of plate thickness results in smaller ultimate strength than that of web by contrast the differences of ultimate strength between the increase of thickness of web and flange are always smaller than 5 hence the change of attached plate thickness should be careful since which would significantly affect the collapse behaviours 4 4 similarity methods with various boundary conditions and evaluation methods the proposed similarity methods could be divided into three groups based on different dominant slenderness in different failure modes normally column slenderness λ and plate slenderness β dominate the collapse behaviours of stiffened panels with beam column buckling mode β and torsional slenderness λ ω determine the ultimate strength of stiffened panels with tripping buckling mode β significantly but either λ or λ ω may slightly influence the collapse behaviours of stiffened panels with multiple buckling web local buckling and elasto plastic failure modes thus for obtaining the most similar collapse behaviours the optimal result among similarity methods ⅰ ⅱ and ⅲ should be adopted since if the similarity methods ⅰ and ⅱ could give reasonable ultimate strength of stiffened panels depends on the specific buckling mode for simplification with avoiding the uncertainty of results in the following sections similarity method ⅲ that could take account of various buckling modes and give intermediate ultimate strength is selected to design the dimensions of small scale models the transverse frames are generally to some degree constrained in the lateral displacements and rotation deformations in actual ship structures which depend on the rigidity of adjacent members however this kind of boundary condition is difficult applied in laboratory in the test of ref xu and guedes soares 2012 fig 14 that illustrates the constraint conditions of transverse frames of stiffened panels the lateral displacements of the transverse frames were supported by steel bars that were free to move in longitudinal direction but the rotations around the transverse frames were also set free since the rotations of the transverse frames are difficult to be constrained in the tests two types of boundary conditions bc1 and bc2 are considered to investigate the influences of rotations of transverse frames on the ultimate strength see table 3 the ultimate strength of full scale models in table 1 and their corresponding small scale models with similarity method ⅲ are calculated by different methods including fem with bc1 and bc2 incremental iterative method in csr h and empirical formulae taken eq 12 in ref zhang and khan 2009 as examples the basis of the incremental iterative method in csr h is that the transverse cross sections of hull girder structures are assumed to satisfy the navier s hypothesis namely plane section hypothesis during the collapse process 2014 common struct 2014 the differences of ultimate strength of the stiffened panels with bc1 and bc2 relate with the specific buckling mode from table 10 and fig 15 for the beam column buckling mode the differences of ultimate strength of stiffened panels with bc1 and bc2 are significant more than 20 e g full scale models t 1 and f 1 and corresponding small scale models t 1 s ⅲ3 and f 1 s ⅲ3 fig 16 shows the equivalent stress distributions of the stiffened panels at ultimate state in which only middle spans are plotted for observation as illustrated in fig 16 a because there exist both longitudinal bending compression and tension stresses under bc1 the average longitudinal stress could be neutralized and then sharply drops after collapse of the stiffened panels however from fig 16 b since the rotation dofs of transverse frames around transverse axis y axis are constrained under bc2 the end transverse cross sections of the middle span keep vertical and parallel which leads to much larger longitudinal compression stress and then larger ultimate strength in addition for the stiffened panels with flanged profiles the buckling mode may change from the tripping buckling mode under bc1 fig 16 c to web local buckling mode under bc2 fig 16 d this is because of the rotational constraints around vertical axis z axis of flange plates at the transverse frames hence the ultimate strength may also obviously increase e g model t 5 under bc1 and bc2 in table 10 nevertheless for the stiffened panels with flat bars because of lacking flange plates the buckling mode remains the same and then their ultimate strength are also very close besides the ultimate strengths with other buckling modes just slightly increase from bc1 to bc2 from table 10 and fig 15 for the stiffened panels with beam column and tripping buckling modes the incremental iterative method in csr h with the assumption of plane section hypothesis gives close ultimate strength with fem bc2 which indicates that the incremental iterative method under this circumstance is suitable to calculate the ultimate strength of stiffened panels with rigid transverse frames bc2 however since the empirical formulae such as zhang khan zhang and khan 2009 were derived under simply supported boundary conditions the ultimate strength assessed by these formulae are close to fem bc1 which means that under this situation they could be considered to assess the ultimate strength with slender transverse frames bc1 especially for the stiffened panels with beam column buckling mode due to the almost same plate slenderness β and column slenderness λ the ultimate strength with empirical formulae between small and full scale models is very close each other among these stiffened panels most of the differences of ultimate strength between small and full scale models are less than 7 while the maximum error is less than 10 as shown in fig 17 this indicates that similarity method ⅲ may be also appropriate to assess the ultimate strength with different boundary conditions and assessment methods for the stiffened panels having beam column buckling mode and stiffened panels with flanged profiles having tripping buckling mode the rotational constraints along transverse frames would obviously increase the ultimate strength and herein the empirical formulae and incremental iterative method in csr h are more suitable to assess the ultimate strength of stiffened panel with slender bc1 and rigid bc2 transverse frames respectively for the other buckling modes the different rigidities of transverse frames slightly influence the ultimate strength various boundary conditions and assessment methods could utilize the proposed similarity methods to evaluate the ultimate strength of small scale models 4 5 error analysis there are mainly three influential factors to affect the differences of ultimate strength between small and full scale stiffened panels first of all the main assumption for three types of similarity methods is using the elastic buckling theories of plate and beam to simulate the mechanical behaviours of stiffened panels due to the influences of interactions between attached plate and stiffener as well as the material and geometric nonlinear properties there exist some differences of mechanical behaviours between the stiffened panel and local plate or stiffener in addition the three different types of predominant slenderness could not completely control all the aspects of the collapse behaviours of stiffened panels which would result in to some degree dimensional distortions when the differences of dimensional scale ratio between the small and full scale stiffened panels are relatively small the variations of ultimate strength are also in the acceptable range because the dimensional distortions of stiffened panels may lead to different mechanical behaviours the differences of plate column and torsional slenderness between the small and full scale models should be as small as possible the last but not the least for the local plates with thin and medium thickness the number of buckling half wave affects the ultimate strength with simply support under axial compressive loads in fig 4 hence it is better to keep the small and full scale models have the same number of buckling half wave the aspect ratio of plate close to m m 1 also introduces uncertainty of ultimate strength which should be avoided if possible 5 discussions since the complete similarity method is not practical or economical for designing the testing specimens the present paper aims to figure out a partial similarity method to scale stiffened panel under axial compression for testing purpose in which three principle parameters column slenderness λ plate slenderness β and torsional slenderness λ ω are included three partial similarity methods are used for considering various buckling behaviours and the influences of different approaches on the relationships of collapse behaviours between small and full scale models are discussed using numerical results for different collapse modes the primary considering parameters are also different during scaling since the principle influential aspects including column slenderness λ plate slenderness β or torsional slenderness λ ω control different structural characteristics hence it is important to investigate the primary influential aspects during scaling models for various collapse modes for beam column buckling mode since the plate slenderness β and column slenderness λ dominate the collapse behaviours similarity methods ⅰ and ⅲ could give similar ultimate strength between full and small scale models for tripping buckling mode β and torsional slenderness λ ω control the buckling behaviours hence similarity methods ⅱ and ⅲ could give acceptable differences of ultimate strength for multiple buckling wel local buckling and elasto plastic failure modes because β significantly but λ and λ ω slightly affect the collapse behaviours the three similarity methods may could be proper to design the small scale models however comparing with similarity methods ⅰ and ⅱ similarity method ⅲ might not be the most suitable option for all collapse modes but the maximum difference between small and full scale models is less than 10 similarity method ⅲ could be considered as a compromised option but not be recommended as the prior approach to determine the dimensions of small scale models for simplification however for obtaining the most similarity different partial similarity methods should be considered separately for different collapse modes actually there exist various dimensional combinations for small scale model when the partial similarity method is adopted moreover the plate thickness of small scale models derived from actual structures might be different with that produced in factory hence the sensitive analyses of plate thickness are also conducted the thickness of attached plate has larger sensitivity coefficient than that of web and flange plates if the change of structural dimensions results in the change of buckling mode during scaling this could significantly influence the collapse strength which should be noticed sometime the rotation dofs on transverse frames are difficult to be constrained in supporting of experimental setup whose influences on the collapse behaviours are also investigated the rotational constraints along transverse frames significantly increase the ultimate strength of the stiffened panels having beam column and tripping buckling modes hence it might be better that the longitudinal girder is also included in the testing specimens which could provide appropriate supporting for the transverse frames 6 conclusions for partial similarity method of stiffened panels under compressive loads there exist different dimensional combinations for the same column slenderness λ plate slenderness β and torsional slenderness λ ω which would introduce different relationships of collapse behaviours between the full and small scale models for various collapse modes from the comparisons of results between the small and full scale modes the partial similarity method is promising and could be adopted to design small testing specimens it is very important to ensure that the full and small scale models have the same collapse modes during scaling the priority parameters considered during scaling are different for various collapse modes by the combinations of different slenderness during scaling stiffened panels the principle parameters are the column and plate slenderness for beam column buckling mode and are plate and torsional slenderness for tripping buckling mode the partial similarity method considering column slenderness λ plate slenderness β and torsional slenderness λω at the same time is not recommended as the prior approach it is suggested that the collapse mode should determined in advance and the partial similarity method should be adopted separately for different collapse modes the dimensional scaling is very sensitive with the thickness of local plate hence the change of stiffener thickness is recommended however the change and scaling of structural dimensions should not change the collapse mode the rotational constraints along transverse frames significantly increase the ultimate strength of stiffened panels with beam column and tripping buckling modes it might be better that the longitudinal girders are also included in testing specimens which could provide appropriate supporting for the transverse frames acknowledgements this work has been supported by the natural science fund of china grant no 51679100 51609192 china fundamental research funds for the

22639,the collapse behaviours of ship structures are usually validated by testing their small scale models for thin wall structures the scale models obtained by complete geometrical similarity might not be economical or practical in test the present study aims to figure out an approach to determine the dimensions of small scale models which have similar collapse behaviours and load carrying capacity with full scale prototypes for this purpose the partial similarity methods are used to design the dimensions of scale stiffened panels considering the influence of collapse modes which could be employed for the experiment in laboratory condition the proposed approaches assume that three principle parameters dominate the buckling behaviours of stiffened panels including plate column and torsional slenderness which are considered as determinate variables in the analyses of partial similarity methods the stiffened panels under uniaxial longitudinal compression are simulated by finite element method the dimensional and similitude analyses of stiffened panels with flanged profiles and flat bars are also performed the ultimate strength and collapse mode are compared between the small and full scale models from the comparison the small scale stiffened panels designed by the partial similarity methods could reasonably represent the collapse behaviours of full scale models keywords

stiffened panels to guarantee the safety of ships and human lives five types of methods are generally used to evaluate the ultimate strength of ship structures including the simple closed form formulations initiated by caldwell 1965 simplified element methods such as idealized structural unit method isum ueda and rashed 1984 incremental iterative method firstly proposed by smith 1977 and employed in iacs csr h requirement 2014 common struct 2014 finite element fe method consisting of both implicit static analysis and explicit dynamic analysis xu et al 2017a and experimental methods xu and guedes soares 2013 since researchers normally can t afford the time and financial costs to test actual ship structures the small scale box girder e g gordo guedes soares gordo and guedes soares 2009 and dow s 1 3 scale frigate model dow 1991 or stiffened panel models xu and guedes soares 2012 have been frequently adopted to test the pre and post collapse behaviours as the simulation of actual ship structures with respect to the geometrical range of selected stiffened panels to conduct compression tests or fe analyses paik et al paik and thayamballi 2007 introduced four kinds of structural modelling including a one stiffener span plate stiffener combination model b one stiffener two spans plate stiffener combination model c multiple stiffeners one span stiffened panel model between transverse frames d multiple stiffeners spans stiffened panel model generally if the rotational restraints along the transverse frames have ignorable influences on the ultimate strength the one span models could be effective and available otherwise two span models are considered more realistic since they can take account for the rotational restraints of two adjacent inter frame stiffened panels along the transverse frames for the purpose of simplifying analytical conditions and reducing computational resources one stiffener stiffened plates were adopted to assess the ultimate compression capacity such as wang and moan 1997 xu et al 2013a adopted two bays spans stiffened panels with the periodical and symmetric boundary conditions to assess the ultimate strength which could automatically consider the appropriate buckling shapes and interactional influences between the adjacent plates and stiffeners which may allow to reduce the uncertainties of modelling experimental results of scale models should reflect and validate the buckling modes and ultimate strength of actual ship structures for stiffened panels with different dimension distributions between stiffeners and attached plates predominantly in plane compressive loads could produce different failure modes which could be categorized into five types in csr h 2014 common struct 2014 as follows a elasto plastic collapse which is gross yielding b beam column buckling mode namely stiffener induced collapse without rotation of stiffeners c tripping buckling mode resulting in subsequent unloading of stiffened panels d web local buckling of stiffeners made of flanged profiles or flat bars e plate buckling mode for transversely stiffened panels the lowest value among various ultimate loads assessed from these five failure modes is regarded as the ultimate strength of stiffened panels the structural response is mainly dependent on the equilibrium equations constitutive relations and compatibility conditions which is the basic theory of similitude laws jones 1974 the complete similarity method is a good option to design the small scale models however for thin wall structures the length and width of stiffened panel members are normally much larger than the thickness it may be not practical or economical to design a small scale model with complete geometrical similarity due to the limitations of financial cost steel plate thickness and capacity of test machine young 1971 hence the dimensional directional analysis with different scale ratios in length and thickness directions was improved araneda 1996 for example garbatov et al 2015 employed this similarity method to assess the ultimate strength of box girder nevertheless the authors assumed the same similarity ratio of bending moment between elastic and elasto plastic stages because it could not take account of the material and geometric nonlinearities properties in the collapse process the closed form empirical formulae are also useful tools to design the small scale models for tests lin 1985 paik thayamball paik and thayamballi 1997 zhang khan zhang and khan 2009 and kim et al 2017 2018 developed the assessment formulae of ultimate strength for stiffened panels under compression which only include plate and column slenderness however it was found that the torsional rigidity is also very important for the tripping buckling of stiffener xu et al 2018 the ultimate strength of the full and small scale models having the same plate slenderness and column slenderness might be very different xu et al 2013b especially under tripping buckling conditions for the scaling of stiffened panels under longitudinal compression the various collapse modes are determined by three types of slenderness later demonstrated in the paper it is vital and necessary to assure that the relevant slenderness of the full and small scale models are the same because each slenderness could differentiate the response of ship structures that they are also interacted with each other when the geometrical and material nonlinearities are considered the present paper aims to figure out practical methods to design the dimensional configurations of small scale models for testing which mainly focus on dimensional and similitude analyses of stiffened panels subjected to compression loads with considering the buckling behaviours the partial similitude approaches are used to design the small scale stiffened panels using fe analysis the stiffened panels having various buckling modes are modelled to investigate the relationships of collapse behaviours and load carrying capacity between the small and full scale models the suggested similarity method is able to ensure that the buckling mode and ultimate strength between the small and full scale models are similar which is practical in the design of testing specimens 2 dimensional descriptions and similitude requirements the stiffened panel normally consists of attached plate and stiffener issc 2012 committee ⅲ 1 2012 report of spe 2012 introduced a series of two spans bays continuous stiffened panels in bulk carrier and vlcc very large crude carrier see fig 1 the combination of one stiffener and attached plate in fig 2 is cut from the corresponding continuous stiffened panels in fig 1 as illustration of different types of stiffeners the dimensions of the stiffeners and attached plates are kept the same with those in table 1 thus the symbol s represents breadth of the plate attached to the stiffener in general tee angle and flat bars have different geometrical cross section characteristics in fig 2 the difference of tee and angle bars is that the flange plates are whether or not symmetric to the webs which have similar pre collapse behaviours and ultimate strength but their post ultimate strength behaviours are different flat bars without flange may lead to different collapse behaviours because the torsional moments of inertia of flat bars are very smaller than that of angle tee bars the present paper mainly focuses on the difference of load carrying capacity of stiffened panels with different scales which would provide some guidelines for designing the testing specimens in the future hence two types of stiffeners tee and flat bars are used in the analyses as shown in table 1 which includes three different dimensions denoting the slender intermediate and stocky stiffeners the attached plates with the length of 2550 mm and width of 850 mm have the thickness of 33 mm 16 mm and 9 5 mm the different dimensional combinations of the plates and stiffeners intend to account for different collapse modes including beam column tripping web local and elasto plastic collapse the scaling laws are generally used to develope the small scale stiffened panels for experimental purpose however it is difficult to fulfil complete similitude requirements in the design of testing specimens hence the partial similitude method by relaxing some of similarity requirements is commonly adopted however which might cause the change of collapse modes between the models with different scales eventually causing different ultimate strength in consideration of various collapse modes plate slenderness column slenderness and torsional slenderness dominating the collapse behaviours of stiffened panels are included in the similarity analyses three types of similitude strategies with keeping predominant parameters the same are developed which are similarity method ⅰ with the same column slenderness λ and plate slenderness β method ⅱ with the same β and torsional slendernss λ ω and method ⅲ with the same λ β and λ ω the priority of similitude strategy is to ensure that the full and small scale models have the same collapse mode and then similar load carrying capacity due to the dimensional interactions the principle parameters λ β and λ ω and dimensions of stiffener and attached plate might have different scales the plate slenderness β is associated with the width and thickness of attached plate for the stiffened panels with flanged profiles the column slenderness λ and torsional slenderness λ ω are adjusted by changing the dimensions of attached plates webs or flanges while for the stiffened panels with flat bars only the dimensions of attached plates and webs could be changed to satisfy the requirements of λ and λ ω these methods may be a little complex and not easily generalised in some cases but they still would be helpful and valuable to establish the relationship of the ultimate strength of stiffened panels between the full and small scale models they could be utilized to design scale stiffened panels for compression tests which could to some degree reflect the collapse behaviours of full scale models during designing the dimensions of testing specimens the small models are scaled initially by the complete geometrical similarity with equal scale ratio of 5 in length width and thickness according to the capacity of the test machine considering the fabrication the length and width of the small scale stiffened panels are generally designed to meet the complete similitude requirements however the thickness series of steel plates produced by steel plants might be not the same with assumed value by complete similitude analysis in this circumstance the calculated thickness of steel plates is adjusted to that is closest to the standard value by the rounding up and rounding down as presented in table 2 the maximum difference between the adjacent normalized thicknesses of the thin plates is around 2 mm hence the attached plates web and flange plates with 1 mm different thicknesses are also simulated to investigate the influences of thickness on the collapse behaviours and load carrying capacity of the small scale stiffened panels the dimensions of the small scale models are showed in table 2 in which the notations of the stiffened panels are explained as follows t i and f i indicate full scale stiffened panel prototypes with different types of stiffeners in which t and f represent the tee and flat bars respectively i means the stiffened panels with different dimensions as presented in table 1 t i s j and f i s j s indicates different small scale stiffened panels s 0 denotes the approximate scale models with close integral plate thickness s ij s ⅱj and s ⅲj indicate the small scale stiffened panels with the partial similarity methods ⅰ ⅱ and ⅲ respectively j equalling to 1 2 or 3 represents the dimension change of both plate and web both plate and flange all members 3 nonlinear fe analysis 3 1 models in fe analysis three coupons have been longitudinally cut from a steel plate made of ah32 the uniaxial tension tests were conducted to obtain the material mechanical properties under the room temperature 20 c the velocity of imposed loading was 1 mm min by the displacement control method the stress strain curves of material were automatically recorded by an extensometer during tests which are plotted in fig 3 b the nominal elastic modulus yield strength and ultimate tensile strength at 20 c are 206 gpa 322 mpa and 486 mpa respectively possion s ratio is generally assumed as constant 0 3 both attached plates and stiffeners are modelled by four node element shell 181 with reduced integration in ansys software see fig 1 b to precisely capture the yielding progress through shell sections the shell element with five integration points through the thickness is selected both geometrical and material nonlinearities are taken into consideration in the nonlinear fe analyses the true material mechanical properties are defined by piecewise linear stress strain curves and multilinear isotropic hardening miso with von mises criteria is chosen to model the plasticity behaviours of the stress strain curve which was derived from three engineering stress strain curves measured by in house uniaxial tension tests as shown in fig 3 b the fe models with two stiffeners for different configurations of boundary conditions were discussed in ref xu et al 2013a and were adopted by tanaka et al 2014 for the collapse behaviour analyses of stiffened panels under longitudinal compression for simplification the stiffened panels with two and four stiffeners have been also used in the compressive tests xu and guedes soares 2012 ghavami and khedmati 2006 gordo and guedes soares 2011 moreover the present paper mainly focuses on the influences of dimensions and similitude methods on the collapse behaviours of stiffened panels for future compression tests hence the stiffened panels having two stiffeners with periodic boundary conditions are adopted in the present comparison analyses because the mesh setting should balance the precision of results and proper computational resources the mesh size is associated with the ratio of element size to thickness of shell element usually at least 5 2009 committee ⅲ 1 2009 based on the convergence analysis of mesh size in ref xu et al 2013a the width of attached plates bounded by adjacent longitudinal stiffeners and transverse frames is divided into 10 elements meanwhile the mesh number is set as 6 for the height of web and width of flange plates for attached plates the aspect ratios of elements on plates are near to 1 furthermore the newton raphson iterative method with large displacement static option in ansys code is selected to calculate the ultimate strength under compressive displacement loads the maximum and minimum numbers of substeps are 100 and 5 the automatic time stepping with default convergence criterion is adopted 3 2 calculation of principle parameters three types of slenderness are considered as the principal parameters that dominant the collapse behaviours of stiffened panels under in plane compressive loads the formulae of plate slenderness β and column slenderness λ of stiffened panels are given as follows 1 plate slenderness β s t p σ y e 2 column slenderness λ l π r σ y e 3 radius of gyration r i a the torsional slenderness of stiffened panels λ ω denotes the influential parameter of tripping or web local buckling modes which is given by ref choung et al 2012 4 λ ω σ y σ ω σ y a i 0 2 π 2 e i ω μ ω l 2 g i t where μ ω is assumed as 1 for continuous stiffened panels σ ω is the elastic torsional buckling stress of centrally compressed members polar radius of gyration i 0 i y i z a warping moment of inertia i ω a ω n 2 d a ω n ω s a ω s d a a ω s 0 s ρ s d s ρ s is the perpendicular distance from the shear centre to mid plane section of stiffened panel members for open thin walled combinations of associated plates and stiffeners i t i 1 n i i t i 1 n b i t i 3 3 details on sub parameters in eqs 1 4 can be referred to fig 2 3 3 boundary conditions table 3 presents the periodic and symmetric boundary conditions of 1 1 2 1 bays spans stiffened panels in which the transverse and vertical axes are y and z while the longitudinal axis is x as illustrated in fig 1 the asterisk indicates that for the nodes at the same coordinate value their degrees of freedom dof are identical in order to keep the deformations of opposite sides of stiffened panels the same c dx means that the imposed in plane loads along the transverse edges have same displacements c u means the nodes keeping uniform in plane movements ship structures generally consist of longitudinal girders and transverse frames to sustain the global hull girder bending loads in the direction of ship length normally longitudinal girders and transverse frames are assumed strong enough to resist the lateral deflections of attached plates the present study mainly focus on the similitude analysis of the stiffeners hence the dimensional influences of the longitudinal girders and transverse frames are not considered instead applying reasonable boundary conditions is adopted which are θ x 0 u z 0 for transverse frames and θ y 0 u z 0 for longitudinal girders as shown in table 3 due to the effects of adjacent plates and stiffeners the boundary conditions of longitudinal edges relate with the positions of stiffened panels in hull structures amdahl according to iacs csr h requirement 2014 common struct 2014 the in plane transverse direction along the longitudinal unloaded edge b1 b4 in fig 1 is free to move but is forced to remain straight due to the surrounding structures and neighboring plates it is possible that the mode of deflections is symmetric or asymmetric which depends on many aspects such initial imperfections load conditions and dimensional combinations of stiffeners and attached plates actually it is unknown what kind of deformations symmetric or asymmetric is the actual collapse shape in advance according to the comparison of symmetric and periodic boundary conditions in ref xu et al 2013a the correct behaviour as a stiffened panel having the initial deflection of buckling mode can be obtained by the periodic boundary condition which gives a logical modelling to continuous stiffened panels and can consider both the odd and even number of half waves and thus is considered to have a smaller model uncertainty for the analysis of continuous stiffened panel hence the longitudinal unloaded edges a1 a4 and b1 b4 have symmetric constraints while the periodically continuous boundary conditions are adopted on transverse edges a1 b1 including c1 c6 and e1 f1 a4 b4 including d1 d6 and e4 f4 as illustrated in fig 1 and table 3 in addition the longitudinal stiffness of transverse frames also affects the simulation of boundary conditions when the transverse frames are rigid enough to resist any rotational deformation the rotation dofs around transverse axis along the transverse frames are constrained while the longitudinal displacement dofs are free with the same displacements otherwise the slender transverse frames would deform with deflections of stiffeners hence bc1 as default and bc2 as additional boundary conditions are designed to investigate and compare the effects of different constraints along the transverse frames on the collapse behaviours the difference between bc1 and bc2 is whether or not the longitudinal rotations of the transverse frame stiffener intersection e2 f2 e3 f3 are restrained the constraint conditions of bc1 and bc2 for continuous stiffened panels are given in table 3 3 4 geometrical initial imperfections fabrication and welding would cause the geometrical initial distortions which significantly affect the collapse behaviours and load carrying capacity of ship structures the actual initial imperfections have complex and diverse spatial variations it is generally adopt the measured initial imperfections in the fe analysis the statistics analysis of measured data shows that the geometrical imperfections could be expressed as fourier series kmiecik et al 1995 the equivalent formulae of initial imperfections of eqs 5 8 are also recommended in issc 2012 committee ⅲ 1 2012 report of spe 2012 to assess the ultimate strength of stiffened panels and hull girder moreover the present study mainly focuses on the relative analyses of similitude between full and small scale models hence the equivalent initial geometrical imperfections are assumed as the superimposition of deflections of plates column type and sideway deflections of stiffeners which are expressed as follows hughes and paik 2010 initial deflection of local plate 5 w 0 p l a 0 sin m π x l sin π y s b 0 sin π x l sin π y b column type deflection of stiffener 6 w 0 s b 0 sin π x l sin π y b sideways deflection of stiffener 7 v s c 0 z h w sin π x l for average level the amplitudes of the above initial deformation formulae are given 8 a 0 0 1 β 2 t p and b 0 c 0 0 0015 l and m means the buckling number of the associated plate between adjacent transverse frames and always defined as a minimum integer satisfying the following equation 9 l s m m 1 however as illustrated in fig 4 for the simply supported rectangular plate subjected to axial compression loads when the imposed half wave shape of initial imperfections in formula eq 5 coincides with the buckling mode there exist abrupt changes at the aspect ratios m m 1 in the curves of ultimate strength versus buckling half wave number ueda and yao 1985 normally the difference of ultimate strength between adjacent buckling half wave numbers gradually decreases as the aspect ratio of plate and then buckling half wave number increase at the same time for initially deflected plate the half wave number in the stable deflection mode above the buckling loads is often one or two larger than the buckling mode for the stiffened panels eq 5 is appropriate to calculate the initial imperfections for local plate with integral aspect ratio l s but when the aspect ratio of local plate is close to m m 1 the influences of different half wave numbers on the collapse behaviours of stiffened panel are slightly for column induced collapse but significantly for plate induces failure xu et al 2017b thus in order to avoid the sharp change of ultimate strength due to the difference of assumed half wave numbers the initial imperfections including symmetric and asymmetric shapes is recommended to replace eq 5 e g eq 10 for aspect ratio near 6 in ref xu et al 2013a a 0 m is set as 0 01t p instead of a 0 0 1 β 2 t p but there exist great differences between the two amplitudes when β 2 is much different from 0 1 thus 0 01t p may be not suitable under some conditions and in this paper a 0m is assumed as the value of a 0 3 0 1 β 2 t p 3 because of the superimposition of three buckling half wave shapes this amplitude gives intermediate ultimate strength between the results with the two adjacent buckling half wave numbers besides the aspect ratio of local plate 10 w 0 p l m 2 4 a 0 m sin m π x l sin π y s b 0 sin π x l sin π y b because the eigenvalue buckling analysis for complex structures always gives local buckling modes that are different from the assumed equivalent initial imperfections the formulae of geometrical initial imperfections eqs 5 10 are calculated as prescribed displacements which are imposed on the corresponding nodes of stiffened panel members by apdl ansys program design language afterwards based on the solved initial deformations the longitudinal in plane displacement loads are applied on the end transverse cross sections of stiffened panels to evaluate the ultimate strength through newton raphson solution 4 analysis of results since the geometrical similitude does not completely fulfil the requirements when the collapse mode is account for it is very important that the adopted specimens should include various collapse modes to consider the influences of buckling hence before the investigation of similitude the numerical simulations have been conducted for the full scale models to make sure that include various collapse modes see fig 5 and table 1 fig 5 shows the collapse deformations of the stiffened panels with tee and flat bars in which web local buckling mode occur for stiffened panels with flat bars due to smaller torsional rigidity moreover in some cases it seems to combine different collapse modes that is not easy to distinguish which buckling mode is predominant from the multiple failure modes e g model t 2 has the multiple buckling modes including beam column and web local buckling modes in fig 5 b model t 3 has the multiple buckling modes with tripping and web local buckling mode in fig 5 c 4 1 ultimate strength of small scale models the small scale model with complete similarity method generally has the same collapse behaviour with the corresponding full scale model the small scale models t i s 0 and f i s 0 with partial similarity method lead to slightly different ultimate strength from the full scale models see table 2 whether the collapse behaviours between the small and full scale models are similar or not is highly dependent on the dimensional differences between them the maximum difference of their ultimate strength is around 5 for the stiffened panels under consideration in table 2 this difference is acceptable which means the partial similarity method is promising to design small scale models under required conditions it is possible that the small scale models with partial similarity method could represent the collapse behaviours of their full scale prototypes however the relationships of the dimensions between full and small scale models are uncertain when the partial similarity method is adopted namely there exist different dimensional combinations for small scale models that still all comply with partial similarity method hence the influences of partial similarity method on the collapse behaviours will be investigated considering various the collapse modes and dimensional combination of the stiffened panels 4 2 dimensional and similitude analysis considering buckling mode the collapse behaviours of stiffened panels including material and geometrical nonlinearities are complex for simplification there are several closed form empirical formulae including plate slenderness β and column slenderness λ for the assessment of ultimate strength of stiffened panels using numerical and experimental data lin 1985 and paik thayamball paik and thayamballi 1997 developed the assessment expressions by the least square method which only differ in the coefficients table 4 as given by 11 σ u σ y 1 c 0 c 1 λ 2 c 2 β 2 c 3 λ 2 β 2 c 4 λ 4 zhang khan zhang and khan 2009 derived a semi analytical formula based on the comprehensive study on the ultimate strength of stiffened panels subjected to uniaxial compression loads which is expressed as the following form 12 σ u σ y 1 β 0 28 1 1 λ 3 2 for λ 2 and take β 1 0 if β 1 0 kim et al 2017 2018 developed another form of closed form empirical formulation to assess the ultimate strength of stiffened panels under longitudinal compression as follows 13 σ u σ y 1 0 8884 e λ 2 1 0 4121 e β for 0 5 λ 5 0 xu et al 2018 also proposed an empirical formula to predict ultimate strength of stiffened panels under combined longitudinal compression and lateral pressure which is given by 14 σ u σ y 1 c 0 c 1 λ c 2 β c 3 λ β c 4 λ 2 c 5 β 2 c 6 λ 2 β 2 c 7 λ 3 c 8 β 3 c 9 λ 3 β 3 c 10 λ 4 it was found that the ultimate strength and collapse modes of the full and small scale models might be different even when their plate slenderness and column slenderness are the same xu et al 2013b the buckling of plate and tripping of stiffener generally interact each other thus the additional torsional rigidity of stiffener is very important for stiffened panels with tripping buckling mode xu et al 2018 however all these above formulae only include plate slenderness β and column slenderness λ but exclude torsional rigidity of stiffener which may not be neglected in some buckling modes such as tripping buckling mode in consideration of torsional slenderness λ ω the designed similarity methods ⅰ ⅱ and ⅲ are employed to compare and investigate their respective effects on the collapse behaviours of stiffened panels including different failure modes and boundary conditions along transverse frames the dimensional and similitude analyses will be separately conducted for different collapse modes next 4 2 1 beam column buckling mode according to eqs 1 4 the stiffened panel with the same principle slenderness λ β and λ ω could include various combinations of geometrical dimensions which might give different results the increase of web height and flange width could enhance the ultimate strength of stiffened panels with beam column buckling mode as expected from table 5 for small scale stiffened panels with tee bars the ultimate strength of stiffened panel models t 1 s i1 and t 1 s i2 with similarity method ⅰ is close to the full scale stiffened panel model t 1 because of similar plate slenderness β and column slenderness λ however the ultimate strength between models t 1 s ⅱ1 and t 1 s ⅱ2 with similarity method ⅱ is different the influence of column slenderness λ on the ultimate strength is larger than that of torsional slenderness λ ω for beam column buckling mode since the same torsional slenderness λ ω changes greater amount of web height than flange width the small scale model t 1 s ⅱ1 has much larger height of web and thus smaller column slenderness λ than that of model t 1 s ⅱ2 which cause that their results are more different the dimensions of stiffened panel model t 1 s ⅲ3 with similarity method ⅲ could be considered as a compromised solution relative to the dimensional variation of web and flange in similarity methods ⅰ and ⅱ model t 1 s ⅲ3 give intermediate ultimate strength for the stiffened panels with flat bars due to the absence of flange plates the similarity method of assessing the ultimate strength with error from small to large may be similarity methods ⅲ ⅰ and ⅱ for this type of collapse mode column slenderness λ is the first priority parameter to be considered during scaling full model similarity method ⅱ without considering column slenderness may lead to different buckling mode and then cause large difference of ultimate strength thus it is not recommended for stiffened panels with beam column buckling mode fig 6 shows the average stress average strain curves for the stiffened panels and material as well as for attached plates and stiffeners separately which are denoted as p and s for the thick attached plates the longitudinal linear stiffness of stiffened panels is close to the elastic modulus of material and the structural moduli between the attached plates and stiffeners are almost the same with that of stiffened panels as expected for beam column buckling mode the longitudinal average stress of stiffeners rapidly decreases after collapse and the longitudinal average stress of stiffeners is much smaller than that of the attached plates the stiffeners buckle prior to attached plates which is classified as stiffener induced buckling mode for the small scale models t 1 s i1 t 1 s i1 and t 1 s ⅲ3 their respective stress strain curves of stiffened panels are similar which indicate that the buckling modes and equivalent stress distributions of the stiffened panels could be acceptably different from the full scale stiffened panel t 1 the ultimate strength with similarity methods ⅰ and ⅲ for the stiffened panels with tee and flat bars are close in which the maximum difference is 6 5 for the beam column buckling mode the plate slenderness β and column slenderness λ dominate the collapse behaviours of stiffened panels hence the similarity methods ⅰ and ⅲ could be employed to design the small scale stiffened panels within acceptable errors while similarity method ⅱ may induce large difference of buckling mode and ultimate strength 4 2 2 combined buckling modes for some stiffened panels there might exist combined buckling modes instead of single type of buckling mode in this circumstance the failure mode can not be separately classified as only one type which might combine beam column web local and tripping buckling modes the proportion of combined buckling modes always changes with the dimension distributions between attached plates and stiffeners and it s difficult to distinguish the predominant buckling mode from table 1 and fig 5 both full scale models t 2 and f 2 has combined buckling modes consisting of beam column and web local buckling modes while the buckling mode of full scale model t 3 is multiple buckling modes including tripping and web local buckling modes hence models t 2 and t 3 are selected to perform the dimensional and similitude analyses in this section regarding the combined buckling modes column slenderness λ or torsional slenderness λ ω may exert more significant impacts on the ultimate strength than each other which depends on the buckling mode components thus from table 6 the model t 2 s ⅱ2 with changing the width of flange has the largest difference of ultimate strength due to the lack of tripping buckling deformations but the model t 3 s i1 with adjusting the height of web gives relatively large different result due to the absence of beam column deflections in order to obtain the appropriate dimensions of small scale models it could be best to select the smallest difference of ultimate strength among the three similarity methods however though similarity method ⅲ with adjusting both the dimensions of web and flange plates maybe not give the closest ultimate strength for small scale models the differences of ultimate strength between full and small scale models are less than 7 2 which could be considered as acceptable error range from fig 7 the longitudinal average stress average strain curves of small scale stiffened panels with similarity ⅲ and their members are slightly different from the corresponding prototypical stiffened panels before collapse of stiffened panels for attached plates with slender and medium thickness e g t 2 s ⅲ3 and t 3 s ⅲ3 the elastic modulus of material is larger than the structural linear elastic stiffness which strongly depends on the thickness of attached plate the longitudinal average stress of stiffener is always larger than that of attached plate for combined buckling modes as the dimensions of attached plate and stiffener vary the buckling mode components are unstable and might gradually change to other buckling modes e g in fig 8 the model t 2 s ⅲ3 with the similar multiple buckling modes but the model t 3 s ⅲ3 with predominant tripping buckling mode either column slenderness λ or torsional slenderness λ ω may more obviously affect the ultimate strength with multiple buckling modes the similarity methods ⅰ ⅱ or ⅲ may give close ultimate strength within reasonable and acceptable errors which depends on the specific buckling mode components the longitudinal stresses of the stiffened panels between small and full scale models are also very similar to each other before collapse 4 2 3 web local buckling mode web local buckling mode often occurs for the stiffened panels with flat bars or with weak web and flange plate among these small scale models of stiffened panels the full scale model f 3 with medium thickness for web and attached plate have web local buckling mode at ultimate state herein from fig 9 a and table 7 the differences of ultimate strength among similarity methods ⅰ ⅱ and ⅲ are slightly but the similarity method ⅲ gives the closest results between small and full scale models the plate slenderness β could significantly but column slenderness λ and torsional slenderness λ ω slightly affect the mechanical behaviours of stiffened panels with web local buckling mode the buckling deformations between small and full scale models are slightly different without obviously affecting the ultimate strength 4 2 4 tripping buckling mode for the stiffened panels with flanged profiles and flat bars full scale models t 5 and f 5 with slender attached plates have tripping buckling mode at ultimate state from table 8 and fig 9 b in similarity method ⅰ adjusting the height of web may significantly influences the ultimate strength but changing the flange width of stiffener could lead to similar results hence for similarity method ⅰ there exists the uncertainty of relationship of ultimate strength between the small and full scale stiffened panels as illustrated in fig 10 a the buckling deformation of small scale model t 5 s i1 is similar with that of the full scale prototype t 5 but the ultimate strength between them is still different from fig 10 b for the stiffened panel f 5 s i1 with flat bars the different tripping slenderness λ ω may change the buckling mode to web local buckling mode and therefore induce large difference of ultimate strength at the same time similarity method ⅱ with changing the size of web and flange plate could mostly give similar ultimate strength with the full scale models which indicates that the dominate parameters for tripping buckling mode should be plate slenderness β and torsional slenderness λ ω similarity method ⅲ give intermediate results between similarity methods ⅰ and ⅱ for the stiffened panels with flanged profiles and even could give the closest ultimate strength for stiffened panels with flat bars 4 2 5 elasto plastic collapse with respect to stiffened panels with thick attached plates there may exist beam column buckling mode for slender stiffeners such as full scale models t 1 and f 1 or gross yielding failure mode for stocky stiffeners for full scale models t 4 and f 4 though the failure deformations seem like tripping or web local buckling deformations the most parts of the stiffened panels entry into plastic stage at ultimate state as illustrated in fig 5 d and at the same time their structural elastic moduli and ultimate strength are close to the elastic modulus and yield stress of material respectively hence the failure modes of models t 4 and f 4 with thick attached plates and stocky stiffeners should be approximately classified as elasto plastic collapse for elasto plastic collapse the relative small variations of dimensions of stiffeners may slightly influence the ultimate strength as indicated in table 9 thus the small scale models with three types of proposed similarity methods could give similar collapse behaviours as illustrated in fig 11 the relationships of longitudinal stress versus strain of attached plates are close to the material mechanical behaviours while the longitudinal stresses for different sizes of stiffeners are slightly different after collapse for stiffener induced failure mode thus similarity methods ⅰ ⅱ and ⅲ could be employed to scale model for elasto plastic collapse which could give similar collapse behaviours and close ultimate strength between small and full scale stiffened panels 4 3 influences of thickness of plates sometimes the thicknesses of small scale stiffened panel members may not meet the standard steel plate thickness series hence they are necessary to be adjusted in the process of fabricating the small scale models herein it s assumed that the small scale stiffened panel members including attached plate web and flange plates could increase the thickness of 1 mm based on the dimensions of small scale model t i s 0 f i s 0 to investigate the influences of variations of thickness on the ultimate strength the sensitivity analyses are also quantified by sensitivity coefficients defined as dimensionless partial derivatives which are given as follows 15 α i σ u t 1 t 2 t i δ t i t n σ u t 1 t 2 t i t n 2 δ t i t i σ u t 1 t 2 t i t n t i δ t i σ u t 1 t 2 t i δ t i t n where t i is the influential parameter which is the thickness of stiffened panel members as illustrated in fig 12 the variations of thickness for tee bars representing flanged profiles and flat bars give different influences on the ultimate strength which depend on the failure mode of the stiffened panels normally for most of buckling modes because the areas of web and flange are always much smaller than attached plate the thickness of attached plate has larger sensitivity coefficient than that of web and flange plates which indicates that the thickness variation of attached plate causes larger change of ultimate strength e g the maximum difference due to the thickness of attached plate is over 15 for models t 3 series at the same time for elasto plastic collapse the increase of thickness of stiffened panel members generally slightly affects the ultimate strength such as models t 4 and f 4 series however if the increase of attached plate thickness results in changing the buckling mode the change of plate thickness could significantly influence on the collapse strength as shown in fig 13 the buckling mode of model f 2 s 0 is web local buckling mode while corresponding model with increase 1 mm of attached plate thickness has beam column buckling mode because the web local buckling mode generates compression stress while the beam column buckling mode induces additional longitudinal bending tension stress which to some degree neutralizes the imposed compression loads thus the 1 mm increment of plate thickness results in smaller ultimate strength than that of web by contrast the differences of ultimate strength between the increase of thickness of web and flange are always smaller than 5 hence the change of attached plate thickness should be careful since which would significantly affect the collapse behaviours 4 4 similarity methods with various boundary conditions and evaluation methods the proposed similarity methods could be divided into three groups based on different dominant slenderness in different failure modes normally column slenderness λ and plate slenderness β dominate the collapse behaviours of stiffened panels with beam column buckling mode β and torsional slenderness λ ω determine the ultimate strength of stiffened panels with tripping buckling mode β significantly but either λ or λ ω may slightly influence the collapse behaviours of stiffened panels with multiple buckling web local buckling and elasto plastic failure modes thus for obtaining the most similar collapse behaviours the optimal result among similarity methods ⅰ ⅱ and ⅲ should be adopted since if the similarity methods ⅰ and ⅱ could give reasonable ultimate strength of stiffened panels depends on the specific buckling mode for simplification with avoiding the uncertainty of results in the following sections similarity method ⅲ that could take account of various buckling modes and give intermediate ultimate strength is selected to design the dimensions of small scale models the transverse frames are generally to some degree constrained in the lateral displacements and rotation deformations in actual ship structures which depend on the rigidity of adjacent members however this kind of boundary condition is difficult applied in laboratory in the test of ref xu and guedes soares 2012 fig 14 that illustrates the constraint conditions of transverse frames of stiffened panels the lateral displacements of the transverse frames were supported by steel bars that were free to move in longitudinal direction but the rotations around the transverse frames were also set free since the rotations of the transverse frames are difficult to be constrained in the tests two types of boundary conditions bc1 and bc2 are considered to investigate the influences of rotations of transverse frames on the ultimate strength see table 3 the ultimate strength of full scale models in table 1 and their corresponding small scale models with similarity method ⅲ are calculated by different methods including fem with bc1 and bc2 incremental iterative method in csr h and empirical formulae taken eq 12 in ref zhang and khan 2009 as examples the basis of the incremental iterative method in csr h is that the transverse cross sections of hull girder structures are assumed to satisfy the navier s hypothesis namely plane section hypothesis during the collapse process 2014 common struct 2014 the differences of ultimate strength of the stiffened panels with bc1 and bc2 relate with the specific buckling mode from table 10 and fig 15 for the beam column buckling mode the differences of ultimate strength of stiffened panels with bc1 and bc2 are significant more than 20 e g full scale models t 1 and f 1 and corresponding small scale models t 1 s ⅲ3 and f 1 s ⅲ3 fig 16 shows the equivalent stress distributions of the stiffened panels at ultimate state in which only middle spans are plotted for observation as illustrated in fig 16 a because there exist both longitudinal bending compression and tension stresses under bc1 the average longitudinal stress could be neutralized and then sharply drops after collapse of the stiffened panels however from fig 16 b since the rotation dofs of transverse frames around transverse axis y axis are constrained under bc2 the end transverse cross sections of the middle span keep vertical and parallel which leads to much larger longitudinal compression stress and then larger ultimate strength in addition for the stiffened panels with flanged profiles the buckling mode may change from the tripping buckling mode under bc1 fig 16 c to web local buckling mode under bc2 fig 16 d this is because of the rotational constraints around vertical axis z axis of flange plates at the transverse frames hence the ultimate strength may also obviously increase e g model t 5 under bc1 and bc2 in table 10 nevertheless for the stiffened panels with flat bars because of lacking flange plates the buckling mode remains the same and then their ultimate strength are also very close besides the ultimate strengths with other buckling modes just slightly increase from bc1 to bc2 from table 10 and fig 15 for the stiffened panels with beam column and tripping buckling modes the incremental iterative method in csr h with the assumption of plane section hypothesis gives close ultimate strength with fem bc2 which indicates that the incremental iterative method under this circumstance is suitable to calculate the ultimate strength of stiffened panels with rigid transverse frames bc2 however since the empirical formulae such as zhang khan zhang and khan 2009 were derived under simply supported boundary conditions the ultimate strength assessed by these formulae are close to fem bc1 which means that under this situation they could be considered to assess the ultimate strength with slender transverse frames bc1 especially for the stiffened panels with beam column buckling mode due to the almost same plate slenderness β and column slenderness λ the ultimate strength with empirical formulae between small and full scale models is very close each other among these stiffened panels most of the differences of ultimate strength between small and full scale models are less than 7 while the maximum error is less than 10 as shown in fig 17 this indicates that similarity method ⅲ may be also appropriate to assess the ultimate strength with different boundary conditions and assessment methods for the stiffened panels having beam column buckling mode and stiffened panels with flanged profiles having tripping buckling mode the rotational constraints along transverse frames would obviously increase the ultimate strength and herein the empirical formulae and incremental iterative method in csr h are more suitable to assess the ultimate strength of stiffened panel with slender bc1 and rigid bc2 transverse frames respectively for the other buckling modes the different rigidities of transverse frames slightly influence the ultimate strength various boundary conditions and assessment methods could utilize the proposed similarity methods to evaluate the ultimate strength of small scale models 4 5 error analysis there are mainly three influential factors to affect the differences of ultimate strength between small and full scale stiffened panels first of all the main assumption for three types of similarity methods is using the elastic buckling theories of plate and beam to simulate the mechanical behaviours of stiffened panels due to the influences of interactions between attached plate and stiffener as well as the material and geometric nonlinear properties there exist some differences of mechanical behaviours between the stiffened panel and local plate or stiffener in addition the three different types of predominant slenderness could not completely control all the aspects of the collapse behaviours of stiffened panels which would result in to some degree dimensional distortions when the differences of dimensional scale ratio between the small and full scale stiffened panels are relatively small the variations of ultimate strength are also in the acceptable range because the dimensional distortions of stiffened panels may lead to different mechanical behaviours the differences of plate column and torsional slenderness between the small and full scale models should be as small as possible the last but not the least for the local plates with thin and medium thickness the number of buckling half wave affects the ultimate strength with simply support under axial compressive loads in fig 4 hence it is better to keep the small and full scale models have the same number of buckling half wave the aspect ratio of plate close to m m 1 also introduces uncertainty of ultimate strength which should be avoided if possible 5 discussions since the complete similarity method is not practical or economical for designing the testing specimens the present paper aims to figure out a partial similarity method to scale stiffened panel under axial compression for testing purpose in which three principle parameters column slenderness λ plate slenderness β and torsional slenderness λ ω are included three partial similarity methods are used for considering various buckling behaviours and the influences of different approaches on the relationships of collapse behaviours between small and full scale models are discussed using numerical results for different collapse modes the primary considering parameters are also different during scaling since the principle influential aspects including column slenderness λ plate slenderness β or torsional slenderness λ ω control different structural characteristics hence it is important to investigate the primary influential aspects during scaling models for various collapse modes for beam column buckling mode since the plate slenderness β and column slenderness λ dominate the collapse behaviours similarity methods ⅰ and ⅲ could give similar ultimate strength between full and small scale models for tripping buckling mode β and torsional slenderness λ ω control the buckling behaviours hence similarity methods ⅱ and ⅲ could give acceptable differences of ultimate strength for multiple buckling wel local buckling and elasto plastic failure modes because β significantly but λ and λ ω slightly affect the collapse behaviours the three similarity methods may could be proper to design the small scale models however comparing with similarity methods ⅰ and ⅱ similarity method ⅲ might not be the most suitable option for all collapse modes but the maximum difference between small and full scale models is less than 10 similarity method ⅲ could be considered as a compromised option but not be recommended as the prior approach to determine the dimensions of small scale models for simplification however for obtaining the most similarity different partial similarity methods should be considered separately for different collapse modes actually there exist various dimensional combinations for small scale model when the partial similarity method is adopted moreover the plate thickness of small scale models derived from actual structures might be different with that produced in factory hence the sensitive analyses of plate thickness are also conducted the thickness of attached plate has larger sensitivity coefficient than that of web and flange plates if the change of structural dimensions results in the change of buckling mode during scaling this could significantly influence the collapse strength which should be noticed sometime the rotation dofs on transverse frames are difficult to be constrained in supporting of experimental setup whose influences on the collapse behaviours are also investigated the rotational constraints along transverse frames significantly increase the ultimate strength of the stiffened panels having beam column and tripping buckling modes hence it might be better that the longitudinal girder is also included in the testing specimens which could provide appropriate supporting for the transverse frames 6 conclusions for partial similarity method of stiffened panels under compressive loads there exist different dimensional combinations for the same column slenderness λ plate slenderness β and torsional slenderness λ ω which would introduce different relationships of collapse behaviours between the full and small scale models for various collapse modes from the comparisons of results between the small and full scale modes the partial similarity method is promising and could be adopted to design small testing specimens it is very important to ensure that the full and small scale models have the same collapse modes during scaling the priority parameters considered during scaling are different for various collapse modes by the combinations of different slenderness during scaling stiffened panels the principle parameters are the column and plate slenderness for beam column buckling mode and are plate and torsional slenderness for tripping buckling mode the partial similarity method considering column slenderness λ plate slenderness β and torsional slenderness λω at the same time is not recommended as the prior approach it is suggested that the collapse mode should determined in advance and the partial similarity method should be adopted separately for different collapse modes the dimensional scaling is very sensitive with the thickness of local plate hence the change of stiffener thickness is recommended however the change and scaling of structural dimensions should not change the collapse mode the rotational constraints along transverse frames significantly increase the ultimate strength of stiffened panels with beam column and tripping buckling modes it might be better that the longitudinal girders are also included in testing specimens which could provide appropriate supporting for the transverse frames acknowledgements this work has been supported by the natural science fund of china grant no 51679100 51609192 china fundamental research funds for the
