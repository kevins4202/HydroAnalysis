4045,accurate annual runoff forecasting is of great significance for water resources management and timely flood control however nonlinear and non stationary runoff series and the complexity of hydrological processes make it difficult to improve the forecast accuracy a hybrid model based on two stage decomposition the support vector machine svm and the combined method is proposed firstly the original annual runoff is decomposed into a series of components imfs by the ensemble empirical mode decomposition eemd the high frequency components of imfs are further decomposed into multiple components vmfs by the variational mode decomposition vmd then the svm is applied to predict all the components the sum of the forecast vmfs is the forecast of each high frequency imf and the forecast annual runoff is obtained by summarizing the forecast imfs finally all the member models are averaged by the simple average method sam which is the combining model to evaluate the proposed model the pingshi station in the lechangxia basin china is selected the results show that the two stage decomposition enormously enhances the forecasting ability the validation r of the optimal eemd vmd svm increases by 20 11 and 11 compared with the optimal svm eemd svm and vmd svm respectively the validation mse decreases by 58 45 and 47 respectively the optimal combined model outperforms the optimal member model because the validation r and mse increase and decrease by 3 and 28 respectively the optimal combined model consists of four member models based on the eemd vmd and one member model based on the eemd this study highlights that combining machine learning methods based on two stage decomposition can effectively improve the forecast accuracy of annual runoff keywords runoff forecasting two stage decomposition ensemble empirical mode decomposition variational mode decomposition combined method 1 introduction extreme hydrological events such as droughts and floods have taken a heavy toll in many parts of the world over the past few decades likely becoming more frequent as a result of climate change zhai et al 2010 droughts and floods cost tens of billions of dollars and cause thousands of deaths every year hirabayashi et al 2013 lack of accurate drought and flood warning information is an important cause of these losses accurate annual runoff forecasting can help decision makers to take scientific measures for flood control water management and water resources planning sepehri and sarrafzadeh 2018 however since the forecast period is long and many influencing factors are involved it is necessary to keep improving the accuracy of annual runoff forecasting the early runoff forecasting models mainly include the autoregression ar li et al 2015 markov chain gelati et al 2010 moving average ma akrami et al 2014 and autoregressive moving average arma kisi 2010 these models require stable time series data with at least 50 to 100 data points to obtain the robust forecasts zhang et al 2018 however runoff series are of strong non linear inconsistent and non stationary characteristics which lead to the difficulty of runoff forecasting zhu et al 2016 accordingly the forecasting performances of these models need improvement amiri 2015 to improve the performance various machine learning methods including support vector machines svm kalra et al 2013 kumar et al 2021 lin et al 2013 artificial neural networks ann humphrey et al 2016 kharroubi et al 2016 kim et al 2021 lenin et al 2020 fuzzy inference systems fis dehghani et al 2019 supatmi et al 2019 zhou et al 2019 convolutional neural networks cnn van et al 2020 and long short term memory lstm kao et al 2020 shuai et al 2020 tennant et al 2020 are applied to runoff forecasting because of their strong applicability in nonlinear mapping for example the enkf and svm models were developed for flood forecasting which significantly improved the accuracy of flood forecasting li et al 2014 to carry out runoff prediction research an ann model was developed for the rainstorm events forecasting on asphalt pavements chua and wong 2011 an adaptive neuro fuzzy inference system based on wavelet analysis was established and applied to the monthly runoff forecasting ren et al 2013 a hybrid lstm neural network and ant lion optimization model was proposed which provided an effective method for monthly runoff forecasting yuan et al 2018 compared with the traditional regression model the prediction accuracy of these machine learning methods has been greatly improved however the complexity of runoff processes makes it difficult for these models to distinguish and identify these characteristics leading to a challenge for accurate runoff forecasting noori et al 2011 previousstudies have shown that the useful information hidden in the runoff series can be extracted effectively by selecting appropriate signal processing methods for data pre processing thus improving the forecast accuracy zhang et al 2015 the signal processing is a general designation for processing various types of electrical signals according to various expected purposes and requirements it can weaken the superfluous content in the signal filter out mixed noises and interference and transform the signal into a form that is easy to process transmit and analyze for subsequent other processing zuo et al 2020a the commonly used signal processing methods include wavelet analysis wa bogner and pappenberger 2011 liu et al 2014 fourier transform ft yu et al 2018 empirical mode decomposition emd rezaie balf et al 2019 ensemble empirical mode decomposition eemd ali et al 2020 yuan et al 2021 and variational mode decomposition vmd xie et al 2019 for instance a new mid long term runoff prediction model coupling wavelet analysis with projection pursuit autoregressive models was proposed for the lixianjiang cascade reservoirs in china jiang et al 2018 six decomposition ensemble models were used to predict the monthly runoff combining emd ssa and wa preprocessing techniques with arma and ann modeling methods zhang et al 2015 zhao and chen 2015 the ann and ar models were developed for mid long term hydrological forecasting based on the eemd wang et al 2015 a hybrid model based on vmd and deep neural networks was proposed to improve the accuracy of daily runoff forecasting he et al 2019 although the signal processing can weaken the redundant content in the original sequence and eliminate the noise interference the single signal processing is often unable to deal with the non stationarity of random and irregular runoff series thoroughly wang et al 2017 based on the single signal processing two stage decomposition is also proposed for unstable and inconsistent problems using the first stage decomposition of the original runoff series the high frequency components are further decomposed in the second stage to obtain more hidden information the two stage decompositioncan effectively eliminate the non stationary characteristics of the runoff seriesand improve the forecast accuracy zuo et al 2020b for example a two stage decomposition prediction framework was proposed to predict monthly runoff through using vmd and support vector regression zuo et al 2020b a new three stage hybrid model was developed to forecast the monthly runoff of swat river in pakistan by combining the gated recurrent unit with the two stage signal decomposition method sibtain et al 2020 a two phase hybrid model based on the complete ensemble empirical mode decomposition with adaptive noises vmd and extreme learning machine with adaptive noises was established for monthly runoff prediction wen et al 2019 because of the complexity and instability of hydrological systems runoff forecasting based on two stage decomposition is in development in addition to signal processing the combined model is another method to improve the accuracy of the model abbasi et al 2021 dhanya and kumar 2011 yang et al 2005 its purpose is to effectively use the advantages of various forecasting models by combining different forecasting models properly and comprehensively utilizing the overall information the combined model can use the valid information of each single forecasting model effectively complement each other s forecasts and increase the forecast accuracy of the system yue et al 2020 for instance a combined prediction system based on the ar autoregressive integrated moving average ann and singular spectrum analysis models was described to predict the monthly streamflow of the guadalupe river in colombia rojo et al 2015 a combined model based on temporal convolutional networks and encoder decoder architecture was proposed to forecast hourly runoff in the jiangxi basin lin et al 2020 the hidden markov model and gaussian mixture regression were combined to construct a combining model for probabilistic monthly traffic forecasting liu et al 2018 both the combined model and the two stage decomposition can improve the forecasting performance however the application of their hybrid model to runoff forecasting has limited reporting therefore the objective of this study is to develop a hybrid model based on the two stage decomposition the svm member models and the combined method for annual runoff forecasting in the lechangxia basin china in detail it entails 1 the decomposition of the original annual runoff series through the two stage decomposition composed ofeemd and vmd 2 the development of member models for runoff forecasting including svm eemd svm vmd svm and eemd vmd svm models 3 the combination of member models by the simple average method and their evaluation by the leave one out cross validation loocv and 4 the application of the proposed hybrid models to the lechangxia basin in china the proposed method makes good use of the two stage decomposition to process non stationary runoff series the nonlinear fitting power of machine learning and the integration ability of combined models 2 methods 2 1 support vector machine the support vector machine svm is a machine learning method proposed by corinna cortes and vapnik in 1995 vapnik 1995 it is based on the statistical learning theory and structural risk minimization principle which has unique advantages in solving small sample and nonlinear problems tomar and agarwal 2015 by mapping the low dimensional sample space to the high dimensional feature space and establishing a linear learning machine in the high dimensional feature space the learning process of svm is transformed into the following convex optimization problem 1 m i n 1 2 w 2 c i 1 l ξ i ξ i s t y i w φ x i b ε ξ i y i w φ x i b ε ξ i i 1 2 l ξ i 0 ξ i 0 the final regression function is 2 f x i 1 l a i a i k x i x j b where φ x is the nonlinear mapping function w is the normal vector of the hyperplane b is the offset of the hyperplane ε is a linear insensitive loss function k xi xj which equals to φ xi xj is the kernel function that satisfies mercer s condition and a i and ai are lagrange multipliers in quadratic programming the performance of the svm model is affected by kernel functions penalty parameter c and kernel parameters there are three types of common kernel functions polynomial sigmoid and gaussian kernel functions andrew 2001 penalty parameter c refers to the tolerance to errors the higher c is the less tolerant the errors of model are and the easier the model is over fitting in gaussian kernel functions the kernel parameter is gamma g to maintain the balance between over fitting and under fitting of the model it is often necessary to adjust the parameter range 2 2 ensemble empirical mode decomposition the ensemble empirical mode decomposition eemd is a noise assisted data analysis method which solves the problem of mode mixing in the emd huang et al 1998 the eemd decomposes the runoff series data into intrinsic mode functions imfs and residuals with different frequencies thus obtaining more useful information the principle of the eemd is to add gaussian white noises to the signal and to obtain the final average of imfs after several emd steps because of white noises added to the signal and the collective averaging the eemd can effectively avoid the problem of mode mixing and then the imf component can maintain its physical uniqueness wu and huang 2009 the specific steps of the eemd are as follows step1 a new sequence is obtained by adding uniformly distributed white noises to the original signal 3 f i t f t w i t where f t is the original signal w t is the white noise and i is the sequence number of the added white noises step2 the emd method is used to decompose the new sequence into n layer imf components and a residual the above steps are repeated and different white noises are added each time until the maximum number n is reached the decomposition results are as follows 4 f i t j 1 n c ij t r i t where cij t is the imf component and ri t is the residual step3 each imf component cj t is obtained by calculating the mean value of the imf components obtained through n times of decomposition 5 c j t j 1 n c ij t n where cj t is the imf component j 1 2 n and n is the number of decomposition both important eemd parameters are the ensemble number and the amplitude of added white noises the relationship between both parameters is as follows wu and huang 2009 6 ε n ε m where m is the ensemble number ε is the amplitude of the added white noises and εn is the standard error between the original signal and the imf in this study the ensemble number is set to 100 and the amplitude of added white noises is set to 0 2 times the standard deviation of the data 2 3 variational mode decomposition the variational mode decomposition vmd is a non recursive signal processing in which the original signal can be decomposed into a series of discrete modal components with specific sparsity properties dragomiretskiy and zosso 2014 it can effectively overcome the pattern aliasing phenomenon in the emd and has stronger noise robustness and weaker endpoint effect the specific steps of the vmd are as follows 1 the associated analytic signal of each sub sequence uk t is calculated by using the hilbert transform to obtain its unilateral frequency spectrum 2 each sub sequence and its corresponding center frequency ω k are modulated to the corresponding baseband and 3 the frequency bandwidth is estimated through the gaussian smoothness of the demodulated signal the objective is to minimize the sum of the estimated bandwidth of each sub sequence thus the constrained variational problem is as follows 7 min u k ω k k 1 k t δ t j π t u k t e j ω k t 2 2 s t k 1 k u k f t where f t is the original sequence u k is the kth component of f t ω k is the center frequency of u k δ t is the dirac distribution k is the number of modes and t is the time script equation 7 can be converted into the unconstrained problem by adding the quadratic penalty factor α and the lagrangian multiplier λ and solved by the alternate directional multiplier method dragomiretskiy and zosso 2014 the solutions for u k and ω k are expressed as follows 8 u k n 1 f ω i k u i ω λ ω 2 1 2 α ω ω k 2 9 ω k n 1 0 ω u k n 1 ω 2 d ω 0 u k n 1 ω 2 d ω where n is the number of the iterations and f ω u i ω λ ω and u k n 1 are the fourier transforms of f t ui t λ t and u k n 1 t respectively 2 4 simple average method the simple average method sam is used as the combining model in the sam combining model the output is the mean of member models the accuracy of the sam depends on both the number of the member models and their forecasting ability the advantages of the sam include better capabilities than the worst member model and simple implementation the sam is expressed as follows 10 y s a m y 1 y 2 y n 1 n i 1 n y i where y is the overall output yi is the output of member model i and n is the number of member models 2 5 leave one out cross validation the leave one out cross validation loocv is a special form of the k fold cross validation method each sample is used as a validation set separately while the rest n 1 samples are used as training sets the average performance of the n models is considered the result of loocv the loocv has two obvious advantages first almost all the samples in each run are used for training the distribution of training samples in each run is closest to that of the original samples thus the evaluation results are more reliable second no random factors affect the data partition ensuring that the experimental process can be replicated the disadvantage of the loocv is the high calculation cost accordingly the loocv is suitable for the case of small samples 2 6 procedures of hybrid models based on two stage decomposition the flow chart of the hybrid forecasting model is illustrated in fig 1 firstly the original annual runoff was decomposed into a series of components imfs with different frequencies by using the eemd secondly the high frequency components of imfs were further decomposed into a series of components vmfs by the vmd thirdly the svm models were established to predict imfs and vmfs the sum of all forecast vmfs was the forecast of each high frequency imf the forecast sequence of annual runoff was obtained by summarizing the forecast of all imfs finally all the member models were averaged by the simple average method sam which was the combining model the training and validation performances of member and combined models were compared based on the loocv since 49 years of runoff data were investigated each sample was used as a validation set separately while the remaining 48 samples were used as the corresponding training set 3 case study 3 1 study area to verify the validity of the proposed model the lechangxia basin located in guangdong china was selected fig 2 this basin is in the middle reaches of the wujiang river which belongs to the east asian monsoon region with uneven rainfall distribution frequent rainstorms and floods in summer the lechangxia reservoir is a key water conservancy project on the river it focuses on flood control and combines power generation shipping and other comprehensive functions the catchment area of the lechangxia reservoir is 4988 km2 the annual average runoff at the dam site is 4 361 billion m3 the reservoir is designed to control the flood of the wushui city and also has significant flood control effects on the shaoguan and lechang cities to support the flood control function the study on accurate runoff forecasting of the reservoir is indispensable but limited due to the relatively short construction time the main runoff changes in the lechangxia basin are controlled by the pingshi hydrological station which was selected as the target station for annual runoff forecasting 3 2 datasets the annual runoff data of the pingshi station from 1964 to 2012 were collected for the model development the data were collected from the shaoguan municipal bureau of hydrography at the pingshi station the multi year average runoff is 98 9837 m3 s the maximum annual runoff is 164 4 m3 s and the minimum annual runoff is 54 6 m3 s generally the long term hydrological process in this area is tele connected with the atmospheric circulation process and ocean conditions at the large temporal and spatial scale thus it is feasible to choose the tele correlated climate and ocean factors to forecast the runoff on this basis four types of tele correlated indicators were selected as predictors including 74 monthly atmospheric circulation indices monthly sea surface temperature data sst on the 180 89 grid points and monthly geopotential height data gh on 100 hpa and 500 hpa surfaces on the 144 73 grid points the pearson correlation coefficient r which quantifies the linear correlation between the annual runoff and the indicators was used to preliminarily select the input variables 11 r i 1 n x i x y i y i 1 n x i x 2 i 1 n y i y 2 where n is the number of samples xi and yi are the values of the indicator and the annual runoff in the ith sample respectively and x and y s are the mean values of the indicator and the annual runoff respectively the linearly related input variables preliminarily selected by r were further optimized by the exhaustive search based on the loocv method in the exhaustive search all input variables were enumerated and evaluated in order all possible combinations of variables can be calculated as follows 12 n s c t i where ns is the possible combinations of variables i is the number of select variables and t is the total number of input variables after the inputs were fixed the data set was divided by the loocv in other words each sample was used as a validation set separately while the rest 48 samples were used as training sets among all possible combinations the model with the best average validation performance was considered the optimal one 3 3 performance evaluation criteria the performances of the models were evaluated by the correlation coefficient r and the mean squared error mse in the loocv the performance indices for the training and validation datasets were calculated by ravg mseavg and rseavg respectively the computational equations are as follows 13 r j 1 n y sj y s y j y j 1 n y sj y s 2 j 1 n y j y 2 14 mse j 1 n y j y sj 2 n 15 r avg r i m 16 mse avg mse i m 17 se i y i y si 2 18 rse avg se i m where n is the number of samples in the training or validation set yj and ysj are the observed and predicted values for the runoff in the jth sample y and y s are the mean values of the observed and predicted runoff m is the total sample number of the dataset i is the number for each run i 1 2 m and yi and ysi are the observed and predicted runoff of the single sample in the validation set for run i the standard deviation std and root mean square deviation rmsd were introduced as additional indices to further compare the optimal member and combined models by the taylor diagram the std and rmsd can be calculated as follows 19 std i 1 n y i y 2 n 20 rmsd i 1 n y i y y ri y r 2 n where n is the number of samples yi and yri are the predicted and observed values for the runoff in the ith sample and y and y r are the mean values of the predicted and observed runoff 4 results analysis 4 1 input variables based on the pearson correlation coefficient between the annual runoff and the tele connected factors at the pingshi station of the lechangxia basin those factors with the significance level of 99 were selected among 74 circulation indexes global sst and gh at 500 hpa and 100 hpa since there is continuity in the vicinity of the sst and gh grid point the maximum value in the highly correlated region was chosen as the input variables eleven predictors were finally selected as candidate input variables table1 these input variables include four sst factors three gh factors at 500 hpa one gh factor at 100 hpa and three circulation index factors in different months among all the variables the correlation coefficient of sst is the highest 0 492 0 516 being followed by the gh 0 464 0 490 and circulation index 0 431 0 463 factors among them the sst at 156 w 36 s in last november and the indian subtropical high area index in last november have the highest and lowest r values 0 516 and 0 431 respectively the above candidate input variables were further filtered and optimized by the exhaustive search method based on the loocv 4 2 single and two stage decomposition three signal decomposition methods were used in this study including the eemd vmd and two stage decomposition firstly the original annual runoff series was decomposed into four imfs and one residual by the eemd which reflected the fluctuation characteristics of annual runoff from high to low frequencies as shown in fig 3 among them imf1 and the residual are the signals with the highest and lowest frequencies respectively the residual reflects the variation trend of annual runoff series then the vmd was introduced to decompose imf1 to prevent excessive decomposition the number of modes k was determined by the mean of the instantaneous frequencies of the components the change of the instantaneous frequencies under different values of k 1 to 9 is shown in fig 4 when k equals to 8 the curve has an obvious downward bending trend thus the critical point was selected as seven the optimal value of k imf1 was decomposed into seven vmfs by the secondary decomposition fig 5 for comparison the vmd was also used to decompose the original annual runoff series according to fig 6 the number of modes k was determined to be seven the decomposition result of the original annual runoff series by the vmd is shown in fig 7 4 3 structure of member models to evaluate the impact of single and two stage decomposition on the forecasting performance four types of member models were investigated namely the svm eemd svm vmd svm and eemd vmd svm models the exhaustive search method based on the loocv was used to determine the structure of the member models including the selection of the input variables and the parameters of c and g the optimal member models were determined by evaluating the performances of all possible combinations of relevant inputs and parameters the number of input variables was searched from 3 to 11 the ranges of parameters c and g were set from 2 5 to 25 the configurations for the representative svm member models are listed in table 2 it can be found that all svm member models have 6 or 7 inputs most of the top three ranked inputs x1 to x3 based on the r are employed in these svm member models the common inputs of these models are x3 x7 and x9 which are the sst gh and circulation index factors respectively similarly the same method was used to determine the parameters for each imf or vmf the optimal parameters of both imfs and vmfs for the eemd svm vmd svm and eemd vmd svm member models are presented in tables 3 to 5 respectively the number of inputs for all components varies from 3 to 10 4 4 performances of member models to demonstrate the effectiveness of two stage decomposition four types of member models were constructed as benchmark models in each of four types the member models with top five performances were selected thus enough member models can be further combined the corresponding performances for the twenty member models are shown in table 6 among them ravg and mseavg represent the average r and mse of 49 runs of the models in the loocv in comparison to the svm eemd svm and vmd svm models the member models with two stage decomposition eemd vmd svm have the highest ravg 0 935 0 958 for training and 0 886 0 904 for validation and the lowest mseavg 66 74 100 89 for training and 145 80 171 72 for validation the member models with single stage decomposition eemd svm and vmd svm are superior to those without decomposition svm in terms of validation and training performances the comparisons indicate that the two stage decomposition can effectively improve prediction accuracy especially its improvement effect is better than the single decomposition eemd and vmd this is because the two stage decomposition can effectively eliminate the non stationary characteristics of the data among all eemd vmd svm member models eemd vmd svm1 has the third highest ravg 0 949 and the third lowest mseavg 82 07 for training performances in terms of validation performance eemd vmd svm1 has the highest r 0 904 and the lowest mse 145 80 the validation r values of the optimal eemd vmd svm increase by 20 11 and 11 compared with the optimal svm eemd svm and vmd svm models respectively the corresponding validation mse values decrease by 58 45 and 47 respectively since the validation performance of the model is of the greatest concern eemd vmd svm1 is considered the best member model for further comparison fig 8 shows the distribution of performance indices for each member model in terms of training performance the r and mse distribution locations of the eemd vmd svm are higher and lower than those of other member models for validation performance the rse distributions of the eemd vmd svm are generally lower than those of other member models among the five eemd vmd svm member models eemd vmd svm1 has the best performance the prediction performances of the member models were further analyzed by comparing the predicted and observed annual runoff values as shown in fig 9 compared with other models the eemd vmd svm models have the smallest deviations of the equal value lines indicating that the predicted annual runoff values are the closest to the observed values the comparison results are consistent with the model performance results in table 6 through the above comparison it is confirmed that the eemd vmd svm outperforms the svm eemd vmd and vmd svm member models in other words the two stage decomposition can significantly improve the prediction accuracy of the member models either with single stage decomposition or without decomposition 4 5 select combined models to compare the effect of four different types of member models on constructing the combined model twenty member models were further used as the candidate inputs for the sam model according to the different types of member models using multiple types of decomposition the combined models can be divided into five types these five types are combined svm without decomposition combined eemd svm combined vmd svm combined eemd vmd svm and combined member models with mixed types the first four types of combined models are based on single type member models while the last one is based on different types of member models in each type of combined models the models with top three performances were selected table 7 lists the configuration and performance of the representative combined models which were evaluated by the exhaustive search method based on the loocv among them en1 to en12 were the combined models using only a single type of member models svm eemd svm vmd svm or eemd vmd svm as input en13 to en15 were established using the mixed types of any of twenty member models as inputs together overall the training and validation performances of en13 to en15 are the best because they have the highest r 0 969 0 973 and 0 933 0 934 and the lowest mse 48 50 53 14 and 105 19 106 34 en10 to en12 have the similar performances to en13 to en15 since they share similar member models based on two stage decomposition en4 to en6 and en7 to en9 have the second and third best performances respectively en1 to en3 have the lowest r 0 866 0 880 for training and 0 766 0 772 for validation and the highest mse 191 62 218 70 for training and 328 24 332 72 for validation it is noted that the inputs of en13 to en15 include y7 y16 y17 y18 y19 and y20 most of which are based on two stage decomposition it is indicated that inclusion of member models with better performances may improve the combined model among en13 to en15 models en13 has the same training and validation r values as en14 0 973 and 0 934 and lower mse values 48 50 and 105 19 since their difference is the inputs of y16 and y18 due to the best validation performance among the combined models en13 is considered the optimal combined model fig 10 shows the distribution of performance indices for the select combined models for the training performance the r and mse distribution locations of en13 to en15 models are higher and lower than those of other models respectively in terms of validation performance the rse distributions of en13 to en15 models are lower than those of other models among en13 en14 and en15 models both the mse and rse positions of en13 are lower than those of the other two models the r position of en13 is higher than those of the other two models it is also noted that the differences of the distribution positions of all performance indices from en10 to en15 are very small fig 11 further compares the observed and predicted annual runoff values of the combined models among these models the deviations of equal value lines for en13 to en15 models are the smallest the above comparison results illustrate that the combined model can significantly improve the prediction accuracy of the member model especially the hybrid model based on the two stage decomposition and the sam method can provide superior model performances for annual runoff forecasting 4 6 optimal models the optimal model for annual runoff forecasting was determined by comparing the performances of the select twenty member and fifteen combined models fig 12 shows the normalized taylor diagram of the observed annual runoff four optimal member models and five optimal combined models in each type in the figure the black solid blue point and purple dotted lines represent the std r and rmsd respectively the rmsd values of the combined models are usually lower than those of the member models the r and std values of the former are basically higher than those of the latter the comparison clearly indicates that the combined models have better performance than the member models since the possible variance of the forecast errors are reduced the best member eemd vmd svm1 and combined en13 models were further compared the r of en13 is between 0 95 and 0 99 which is higher than that of eemd vmd svm1 0 95 although the rmsd of en13 and eemd vmd svm1 are both between 0 2 and 0 4 the rmsd of en13 is closer to 0 2 and lower than that of eemd vmd svm1 there is no significant difference in std between both models thus the performance of en13 is better than that of eemd vmd svm1 it is also noted from tables 6 and 7 that among all the member and combined models en13 has the highest r and the lowest mse for both training and validation the r and mse for validation of the en13 increase and decrease by 3 and 28 respectively compared with the optimal member model eemd vmd svm1 therefore en13 was determined as the optimal model for annual runoff forecasting the structure of en13 is shown in fig 13 the member models of en13 include one model based on one stage decomposition eemd svm2 and four models based on two stage decomposition eemd vmd svm2 eemd vmd svm3 eemd vmd svm4 and eemd vmd svm5 5 discussion the forecasting performances of the eemd vmd svm models are much better than those of the svm eemd svm and vmd svm models this implies that the proposed model based on the combined member models using two stage decomposition is a promising method for annual runoff forecasting however the proposed two stage decomposition is merely based on the eemd and vmd in fact other types of signal decomposition technologies such as complementary ensemble empirical mode decomposition yeh et al 2010 and discrete wavelet transform hadi and tombul 2018 can also be introduced to the hybrid forecasting framework these methods have been applied in previous hydrological studies with better effects on improving model performance in terms of the type of combining models although the adopted sam model has achieved better forecasting performance many other types of combining models including boosting anctil et al 2004 and bagging zaier et al 2010 can be further applied to future annual runoff forecasting in this study the svm with good generalization ability is selected as the basic type of member model to further improve the performance of the member model different types of member models such as the ann tan et al 2018 adaptive neuro fuzzy inference system zhou et al 2019 lstm ni et al 2020 and cnn lstm models yan et al 2021 yang et al 2021 can be introduced and coupled with different signal decomposition methods for annual runoff forecasting it should be noted that the differences between the mseavg for training and the mse for validation of most member and combined models are relatively large this is mainly because the loocv needs to use different calculation methods of performance indices for training and validation sets in the loocv each sample is selected in turn as the validation set separately the mse for validation is calculated using the predicted and measured values of 49 annual runoff samples while the mseavg for training is the average of the mse values for training sets in 49 runs this difference can be enlarged when extreme points exist in the validation set which is especially true for annual runoff forecasting in the selection of input variables only the linear correlation between the input variables and annual runoff was considered the non linear correlation indices such as the mutual information mi indices and spearman rank correlation coefficient can be introduced to quantify the non linear relationships between the runoff and the associated factors in addition it is well known that all changes in hydrological elements have their specific physical mechanisms therefore explanations of the rationality of predictors from physical causes analysis of the physical mechanism of hydrological phenomena and establishment of the forecasting model based on strict physical causes are the basic principle that should be followed in future runoff and other hydrological forecasting studies 6 conclusions in this study a hybrid model based on the two stage decomposition the svm member models and the combining method was proposed and applied to annual runoff forecasting of the pingshi station in the lechangxia basin china the original annual runoff

hydrological processes make it difficult to improve the forecast accuracy a hybrid model based on two stage decomposition the support vector machine svm and the combined method is proposed firstly the original annual runoff is decomposed into a series of components imfs by the ensemble empirical mode decomposition eemd the high frequency components of imfs are further decomposed into multiple components vmfs by the variational mode decomposition vmd then the svm is applied to predict all the components the sum of the forecast vmfs is the forecast of each high frequency imf and the forecast annual runoff is obtained by summarizing the forecast imfs finally all the member models are averaged by the simple average method sam which is the combining model to evaluate the proposed model the

two stage decomposition ensemble empirical mode decomposition variational mode decomposition combined method 1 introduction extreme hydrological events such as droughts and floods have taken a heavy toll in many parts of the world over the past few decades likely becoming more frequent as a result of climate change zhai et al 2010 droughts and floods cost tens of billions of dollars and cause thousands of deaths every year hirabayashi et al 2013 lack of accurate drought and flood warning information is an important cause of these losses accurate annual runoff forecasting can help decision makers to take scientific measures for flood control water management and water resources planning sepehri and sarrafzadeh 2018 however since the forecast period is long and many influencing factors are involved it is necessary to keep improving the accuracy of annual runoff forecasting the early runoff forecasting models mainly include the autoregression ar li et al 2015 markov chain gelati et al 2010 moving average ma akrami et al 2014 and autoregressive moving average arma kisi 2010 these models require stable time series data with at least 50 to 100 data points to obtain the robust forecasts zhang et al 2018 however runoff series are of strong non linear inconsistent and non stationary characteristics which lead to the difficulty of runoff forecasting zhu et al 2016 accordingly the forecasting performances of these models need improvement amiri 2015 to improve the performance various machine learning methods including support vector machines svm kalra et al 2013 kumar et al 2021 lin et al 2013 artificial neural networks ann humphrey et al 2016 kharroubi et al 2016 kim et al 2021 lenin et al 2020 fuzzy inference systems fis dehghani et al 2019 supatmi et al 2019 zhou et al 2019 convolutional neural networks cnn van et al 2020 and long short term memory lstm kao et al 2020 shuai et al 2020 tennant et al 2020 are applied to runoff forecasting because of their strong applicability in nonlinear mapping for example the enkf and svm models were developed for flood forecasting which significantly improved the accuracy of flood forecasting li et al 2014 to carry out runoff prediction research an ann model was developed for the rainstorm events forecasting on asphalt pavements chua and wong 2011 an adaptive neuro fuzzy inference system based on wavelet analysis was established and applied to the monthly runoff forecasting ren et al 2013 a hybrid lstm neural network and ant lion optimization model was proposed which provided an effective method for monthly runoff forecasting yuan et al 2018 compared with the traditional regression model the prediction accuracy of these machine learning methods has been greatly improved however the complexity of runoff processes makes it difficult for these models to distinguish and identify these characteristics leading to a challenge for accurate runoff forecasting noori et al 2011 previousstudies have shown that the useful information hidden in the runoff series can be extracted effectively by selecting appropriate signal processing methods for data pre processing thus improving the forecast accuracy zhang et al 2015 the signal processing is a general designation for processing various types of electrical signals according to various expected purposes and requirements it can weaken the superfluous content in the signal filter out mixed noises and interference and transform the signal into a form that is easy to process transmit and analyze for subsequent other processing zuo et al 2020a the commonly used signal processing methods include wavelet analysis wa bogner and pappenberger 2011 liu et al 2014 fourier transform ft yu et al 2018 empirical mode decomposition emd rezaie balf et al 2019 ensemble empirical mode decomposition eemd ali et al 2020 yuan et al 2021 and variational mode decomposition vmd xie et al 2019 for instance a new mid long term runoff prediction model coupling wavelet analysis with projection pursuit autoregressive models was proposed for the lixianjiang cascade reservoirs in china jiang et al 2018 six decomposition ensemble models were used to predict the monthly runoff combining emd ssa and wa preprocessing techniques with arma and ann modeling methods zhang et al 2015 zhao and chen 2015 the ann and ar models were developed for mid long term hydrological forecasting based on the eemd wang et al 2015 a hybrid model based on vmd and deep neural networks was proposed to improve the accuracy of daily runoff forecasting he et al 2019 although the signal processing can weaken the redundant content in the original sequence and eliminate the noise interference the single signal processing is often unable to deal with the non stationarity of random and irregular runoff series thoroughly wang et al 2017 based on the single signal processing two stage decomposition is also proposed for unstable and inconsistent problems using the first stage decomposition of the original runoff series the high frequency components are further decomposed in the second stage to obtain more hidden information the two stage decompositioncan effectively eliminate the non stationary characteristics of the runoff seriesand improve the forecast accuracy zuo et al 2020b for example a two stage decomposition prediction framework was proposed to predict monthly runoff through using vmd and support vector regression zuo et al 2020b a new three stage hybrid model was developed to forecast the monthly runoff of swat river in pakistan by combining the gated recurrent unit with the two stage signal decomposition method sibtain et al 2020 a two phase hybrid model based on the complete ensemble empirical mode decomposition with adaptive noises vmd and extreme learning machine with adaptive noises was established for monthly runoff prediction wen et al 2019 because of the complexity and instability of hydrological systems runoff forecasting based on two stage decomposition is in development in addition to signal processing the combined model is another method to improve the accuracy of the model abbasi et al 2021 dhanya and kumar 2011 yang et al 2005 its purpose is to effectively use the advantages of various forecasting models by combining different forecasting models properly and comprehensively utilizing the overall information the combined model can use the valid information of each single forecasting model effectively complement each other s forecasts and increase the forecast accuracy of the system yue et al 2020 for instance a combined prediction system based on the ar autoregressive integrated moving average ann and singular spectrum analysis models was described to predict the monthly streamflow of the guadalupe river in colombia rojo et al 2015 a combined model based on temporal convolutional networks and encoder decoder architecture was proposed to forecast hourly runoff in the jiangxi basin lin et al 2020 the hidden markov model and gaussian mixture regression were combined to construct a combining model for probabilistic monthly traffic forecasting liu et al 2018 both the combined model and the two stage decomposition can improve the forecasting performance however the application of their hybrid model to runoff forecasting has limited reporting therefore the objective of this study is to develop a hybrid model based on the two stage decomposition the svm member models and the combined method for annual runoff forecasting in the lechangxia basin china in detail it entails 1 the decomposition of the original annual runoff series through the two stage decomposition composed ofeemd and vmd 2 the development of member models for runoff forecasting including svm eemd svm vmd svm and eemd vmd svm models 3 the combination of member models by the simple average method and their evaluation by the leave one out cross validation loocv and 4 the application of the proposed hybrid models to the lechangxia basin in china the proposed method makes good use of the two stage decomposition to process non stationary runoff series the nonlinear fitting power of machine learning and the integration ability of combined models 2 methods 2 1 support vector machine the support vector machine svm is a machine learning method proposed by corinna cortes and vapnik in 1995 vapnik 1995 it is based on the statistical learning theory and structural risk minimization principle which has unique advantages in solving small sample and nonlinear problems tomar and agarwal 2015 by mapping the low dimensional sample space to the high dimensional feature space and establishing a linear learning machine in the high dimensional feature space the learning process of svm is transformed into the following convex optimization problem 1 m i n 1 2 w 2 c i 1 l ξ i ξ i s t y i w φ x i b ε ξ i y i w φ x i b ε ξ i i 1 2 l ξ i 0 ξ i 0 the final regression function is 2 f x i 1 l a i a i k x i x j b where φ x is the nonlinear mapping function w is the normal vector of the hyperplane b is the offset of the hyperplane ε is a linear insensitive loss function k xi xj which equals to φ xi xj is the kernel function that satisfies mercer s condition and a i and ai are lagrange multipliers in quadratic programming the performance of the svm model is affected by kernel functions penalty parameter c and kernel parameters there are three types of common kernel functions polynomial sigmoid and gaussian kernel functions andrew 2001 penalty parameter c refers to the tolerance to errors the higher c is the less tolerant the errors of model are and the easier the model is over fitting in gaussian kernel functions the kernel parameter is gamma g to maintain the balance between over fitting and under fitting of the model it is often necessary to adjust the parameter range 2 2 ensemble empirical mode decomposition the ensemble empirical mode decomposition eemd is a noise assisted data analysis method which solves the problem of mode mixing in the emd huang et al 1998 the eemd decomposes the runoff series data into intrinsic mode functions imfs and residuals with different frequencies thus obtaining more useful information the principle of the eemd is to add gaussian white noises to the signal and to obtain the final average of imfs after several emd steps because of white noises added to the signal and the collective averaging the eemd can effectively avoid the problem of mode mixing and then the imf component can maintain its physical uniqueness wu and huang 2009 the specific steps of the eemd are as follows step1 a new sequence is obtained by adding uniformly distributed white noises to the original signal 3 f i t f t w i t where f t is the original signal w t is the white noise and i is the sequence number of the added white noises step2 the emd method is used to decompose the new sequence into n layer imf components and a residual the above steps are repeated and different white noises are added each time until the maximum number n is reached the decomposition results are as follows 4 f i t j 1 n c ij t r i t where cij t is the imf component and ri t is the residual step3 each imf component cj t is obtained by calculating the mean value of the imf components obtained through n times of decomposition 5 c j t j 1 n c ij t n where cj t is the imf component j 1 2 n and n is the number of decomposition both important eemd parameters are the ensemble number and the amplitude of added white noises the relationship between both parameters is as follows wu and huang 2009 6 ε n ε m where m is the ensemble number ε is the amplitude of the added white noises and εn is the standard error between the original signal and the imf in this study the ensemble number is set to 100 and the amplitude of added white noises is set to 0 2 times the standard deviation of the data 2 3 variational mode decomposition the variational mode decomposition vmd is a non recursive signal processing in which the original signal can be decomposed into a series of discrete modal components with specific sparsity properties dragomiretskiy and zosso 2014 it can effectively overcome the pattern aliasing phenomenon in the emd and has stronger noise robustness and weaker endpoint effect the specific steps of the vmd are as follows 1 the associated analytic signal of each sub sequence uk t is calculated by using the hilbert transform to obtain its unilateral frequency spectrum 2 each sub sequence and its corresponding center frequency ω k are modulated to the corresponding baseband and 3 the frequency bandwidth is estimated through the gaussian smoothness of the demodulated signal the objective is to minimize the sum of the estimated bandwidth of each sub sequence thus the constrained variational problem is as follows 7 min u k ω k k 1 k t δ t j π t u k t e j ω k t 2 2 s t k 1 k u k f t where f t is the original sequence u k is the kth component of f t ω k is the center frequency of u k δ t is the dirac distribution k is the number of modes and t is the time script equation 7 can be converted into the unconstrained problem by adding the quadratic penalty factor α and the lagrangian multiplier λ and solved by the alternate directional multiplier method dragomiretskiy and zosso 2014 the solutions for u k and ω k are expressed as follows 8 u k n 1 f ω i k u i ω λ ω 2 1 2 α ω ω k 2 9 ω k n 1 0 ω u k n 1 ω 2 d ω 0 u k n 1 ω 2 d ω where n is the number of the iterations and f ω u i ω λ ω and u k n 1 are the fourier transforms of f t ui t λ t and u k n 1 t respectively 2 4 simple average method the simple average method sam is used as the combining model in the sam combining model the output is the mean of member models the accuracy of the sam depends on both the number of the member models and their forecasting ability the advantages of the sam include better capabilities than the worst member model and simple implementation the sam is expressed as follows 10 y s a m y 1 y 2 y n 1 n i 1 n y i where y is the overall output yi is the output of member model i and n is the number of member models 2 5 leave one out cross validation the leave one out cross validation loocv is a special form of the k fold cross validation method each sample is used as a validation set separately while the rest n 1 samples are used as training sets the average performance of the n models is considered the result of loocv the loocv has two obvious advantages first almost all the samples in each run are used for training the distribution of training samples in each run is closest to that of the original samples thus the evaluation results are more reliable second no random factors affect the data partition ensuring that the experimental process can be replicated the disadvantage of the loocv is the high calculation cost accordingly the loocv is suitable for the case of small samples 2 6 procedures of hybrid models based on two stage decomposition the flow chart of the hybrid forecasting model is illustrated in fig 1 firstly the original annual runoff was decomposed into a series of components imfs with different frequencies by using the eemd secondly the high frequency components of imfs were further decomposed into a series of components vmfs by the vmd thirdly the svm models were established to predict imfs and vmfs the sum of all forecast vmfs was the forecast of each high frequency imf the forecast sequence of annual runoff was obtained by summarizing the forecast of all imfs finally all the member models were averaged by the simple average method sam which was the combining model the training and validation performances of member and combined models were compared based on the loocv since 49 years of runoff data were investigated each sample was used as a validation set separately while the remaining 48 samples were used as the corresponding training set 3 case study 3 1 study area to verify the validity of the proposed model the lechangxia basin located in guangdong china was selected fig 2 this basin is in the middle reaches of the wujiang river which belongs to the east asian monsoon region with uneven rainfall distribution frequent rainstorms and floods in summer the lechangxia reservoir is a key water conservancy project on the river it focuses on flood control and combines power generation shipping and other comprehensive functions the catchment area of the lechangxia reservoir is 4988 km2 the annual average runoff at the dam site is 4 361 billion m3 the reservoir is designed to control the flood of the wushui city and also has significant flood control effects on the shaoguan and lechang cities to support the flood control function the study on accurate runoff forecasting of the reservoir is indispensable but limited due to the relatively short construction time the main runoff changes in the lechangxia basin are controlled by the pingshi hydrological station which was selected as the target station for annual runoff forecasting 3 2 datasets the annual runoff data of the pingshi station from 1964 to 2012 were collected for the model development the data were collected from the shaoguan municipal bureau of hydrography at the pingshi station the multi year average runoff is 98 9837 m3 s the maximum annual runoff is 164 4 m3 s and the minimum annual runoff is 54 6 m3 s generally the long term hydrological process in this area is tele connected with the atmospheric circulation process and ocean conditions at the large temporal and spatial scale thus it is feasible to choose the tele correlated climate and ocean factors to forecast the runoff on this basis four types of tele correlated indicators were selected as predictors including 74 monthly atmospheric circulation indices monthly sea surface temperature data sst on the 180 89 grid points and monthly geopotential height data gh on 100 hpa and 500 hpa surfaces on the 144 73 grid points the pearson correlation coefficient r which quantifies the linear correlation between the annual runoff and the indicators was used to preliminarily select the input variables 11 r i 1 n x i x y i y i 1 n x i x 2 i 1 n y i y 2 where n is the number of samples xi and yi are the values of the indicator and the annual runoff in the ith sample respectively and x and y s are the mean values of the indicator and the annual runoff respectively the linearly related input variables preliminarily selected by r were further optimized by the exhaustive search based on the loocv method in the exhaustive search all input variables were enumerated and evaluated in order all possible combinations of variables can be calculated as follows 12 n s c t i where ns is the possible combinations of variables i is the number of select variables and t is the total number of input variables after the inputs were fixed the data set was divided by the loocv in other words each sample was used as a validation set separately while the rest 48 samples were used as training sets among all possible combinations the model with the best average validation performance was considered the optimal one 3 3 performance evaluation criteria the performances of the models were evaluated by the correlation coefficient r and the mean squared error mse in the loocv the performance indices for the training and validation datasets were calculated by ravg mseavg and rseavg respectively the computational equations are as follows 13 r j 1 n y sj y s y j y j 1 n y sj y s 2 j 1 n y j y 2 14 mse j 1 n y j y sj 2 n 15 r avg r i m 16 mse avg mse i m 17 se i y i y si 2 18 rse avg se i m where n is the number of samples in the training or validation set yj and ysj are the observed and predicted values for the runoff in the jth sample y and y s are the mean values of the observed and predicted runoff m is the total sample number of the dataset i is the number for each run i 1 2 m and yi and ysi are the observed and predicted runoff of the single sample in the validation set for run i the standard deviation std and root mean square deviation rmsd were introduced as additional indices to further compare the optimal member and combined models by the taylor diagram the std and rmsd can be calculated as follows 19 std i 1 n y i y 2 n 20 rmsd i 1 n y i y y ri y r 2 n where n is the number of samples yi and yri are the predicted and observed values for the runoff in the ith sample and y and y r are the mean values of the predicted and observed runoff 4 results analysis 4 1 input variables based on the pearson correlation coefficient between the annual runoff and the tele connected factors at the pingshi station of the lechangxia basin those factors with the significance level of 99 were selected among 74 circulation indexes global sst and gh at 500 hpa and 100 hpa since there is continuity in the vicinity of the sst and gh grid point the maximum value in the highly correlated region was chosen as the input variables eleven predictors were finally selected as candidate input variables table1 these input variables include four sst factors three gh factors at 500 hpa one gh factor at 100 hpa and three circulation index factors in different months among all the variables the correlation coefficient of sst is the highest 0 492 0 516 being followed by the gh 0 464 0 490 and circulation index 0 431 0 463 factors among them the sst at 156 w 36 s in last november and the indian subtropical high area index in last november have the highest and lowest r values 0 516 and 0 431 respectively the above candidate input variables were further filtered and optimized by the exhaustive search method based on the loocv 4 2 single and two stage decomposition three signal decomposition methods were used in this study including the eemd vmd and two stage decomposition firstly the original annual runoff series was decomposed into four imfs and one residual by the eemd which reflected the fluctuation characteristics of annual runoff from high to low frequencies as shown in fig 3 among them imf1 and the residual are the signals with the highest and lowest frequencies respectively the residual reflects the variation trend of annual runoff series then the vmd was introduced to decompose imf1 to prevent excessive decomposition the number of modes k was determined by the mean of the instantaneous frequencies of the components the change of the instantaneous frequencies under different values of k 1 to 9 is shown in fig 4 when k equals to 8 the curve has an obvious downward bending trend thus the critical point was selected as seven the optimal value of k imf1 was decomposed into seven vmfs by the secondary decomposition fig 5 for comparison the vmd was also used to decompose the original annual runoff series according to fig 6 the number of modes k was determined to be seven the decomposition result of the original annual runoff series by the vmd is shown in fig 7 4 3 structure of member models to evaluate the impact of single and two stage decomposition on the forecasting performance four types of member models were investigated namely the svm eemd svm vmd svm and eemd vmd svm models the exhaustive search method based on the loocv was used to determine the structure of the member models including the selection of the input variables and the parameters of c and g the optimal member models were determined by evaluating the performances of all possible combinations of relevant inputs and parameters the number of input variables was searched from 3 to 11 the ranges of parameters c and g were set from 2 5 to 25 the configurations for the representative svm member models are listed in table 2 it can be found that all svm member models have 6 or 7 inputs most of the top three ranked inputs x1 to x3 based on the r are employed in these svm member models the common inputs of these models are x3 x7 and x9 which are the sst gh and circulation index factors respectively similarly the same method was used to determine the parameters for each imf or vmf the optimal parameters of both imfs and vmfs for the eemd svm vmd svm and eemd vmd svm member models are presented in tables 3 to 5 respectively the number of inputs for all components varies from 3 to 10 4 4 performances of member models to demonstrate the effectiveness of two stage decomposition four types of member models were constructed as benchmark models in each of four types the member models with top five performances were selected thus enough member models can be further combined the corresponding performances for the twenty member models are shown in table 6 among them ravg and mseavg represent the average r and mse of 49 runs of the models in the loocv in comparison to the svm eemd svm and vmd svm models the member models with two stage decomposition eemd vmd svm have the highest ravg 0 935 0 958 for training and 0 886 0 904 for validation and the lowest mseavg 66 74 100 89 for training and 145 80 171 72 for validation the member models with single stage decomposition eemd svm and vmd svm are superior to those without decomposition svm in terms of validation and training performances the comparisons indicate that the two stage decomposition can effectively improve prediction accuracy especially its improvement effect is better than the single decomposition eemd and vmd this is because the two stage decomposition can effectively eliminate the non stationary characteristics of the data among all eemd vmd svm member models eemd vmd svm1 has the third highest ravg 0 949 and the third lowest mseavg 82 07 for training performances in terms of validation performance eemd vmd svm1 has the highest r 0 904 and the lowest mse 145 80 the validation r values of the optimal eemd vmd svm increase by 20 11 and 11 compared with the optimal svm eemd svm and vmd svm models respectively the corresponding validation mse values decrease by 58 45 and 47 respectively since the validation performance of the model is of the greatest concern eemd vmd svm1 is considered the best member model for further comparison fig 8 shows the distribution of performance indices for each member model in terms of training performance the r and mse distribution locations of the eemd vmd svm are higher and lower than those of other member models for validation performance the rse distributions of the eemd vmd svm are generally lower than those of other member models among the five eemd vmd svm member models eemd vmd svm1 has the best performance the prediction performances of the member models were further analyzed by comparing the predicted and observed annual runoff values as shown in fig 9 compared with other models the eemd vmd svm models have the smallest deviations of the equal value lines indicating that the predicted annual runoff values are the closest to the observed values the comparison results are consistent with the model performance results in table 6 through the above comparison it is confirmed that the eemd vmd svm outperforms the svm eemd vmd and vmd svm member models in other words the two stage decomposition can significantly improve the prediction accuracy of the member models either with single stage decomposition or without decomposition 4 5 select combined models to compare the effect of four different types of member models on constructing the combined model twenty member models were further used as the candidate inputs for the sam model according to the different types of member models using multiple types of decomposition the combined models can be divided into five types these five types are combined svm without decomposition combined eemd svm combined vmd svm combined eemd vmd svm and combined member models with mixed types the first four types of combined models are based on single type member models while the last one is based on different types of member models in each type of combined models the models with top three performances were selected table 7 lists the configuration and performance of the representative combined models which were evaluated by the exhaustive search method based on the loocv among them en1 to en12 were the combined models using only a single type of member models svm eemd svm vmd svm or eemd vmd svm as input en13 to en15 were established using the mixed types of any of twenty member models as inputs together overall the training and validation performances of en13 to en15 are the best because they have the highest r 0 969 0 973 and 0 933 0 934 and the lowest mse 48 50 53 14 and 105 19 106 34 en10 to en12 have the similar performances to en13 to en15 since they share similar member models based on two stage decomposition en4 to en6 and en7 to en9 have the second and third best performances respectively en1 to en3 have the lowest r 0 866 0 880 for training and 0 766 0 772 for validation and the highest mse 191 62 218 70 for training and 328 24 332 72 for validation it is noted that the inputs of en13 to en15 include y7 y16 y17 y18 y19 and y20 most of which are based on two stage decomposition it is indicated that inclusion of member models with better performances may improve the combined model among en13 to en15 models en13 has the same training and validation r values as en14 0 973 and 0 934 and lower mse values 48 50 and 105 19 since their difference is the inputs of y16 and y18 due to the best validation performance among the combined models en13 is considered the optimal combined model fig 10 shows the distribution of performance indices for the select combined models for the training performance the r and mse distribution locations of en13 to en15 models are higher and lower than those of other models respectively in terms of validation performance the rse distributions of en13 to en15 models are lower than those of other models among en13 en14 and en15 models both the mse and rse positions of en13 are lower than those of the other two models the r position of en13 is higher than those of the other two models it is also noted that the differences of the distribution positions of all performance indices from en10 to en15 are very small fig 11 further compares the observed and predicted annual runoff values of the combined models among these models the deviations of equal value lines for en13 to en15 models are the smallest the above comparison results illustrate that the combined model can significantly improve the prediction accuracy of the member model especially the hybrid model based on the two stage decomposition and the sam method can provide superior model performances for annual runoff forecasting 4 6 optimal models the optimal model for annual runoff forecasting was determined by comparing the performances of the select twenty member and fifteen combined models fig 12 shows the normalized taylor diagram of the observed annual runoff four optimal member models and five optimal combined models in each type in the figure the black solid blue point and purple dotted lines represent the std r and rmsd respectively the rmsd values of the combined models are usually lower than those of the member models the r and std values of the former are basically higher than those of the latter the comparison clearly indicates that the combined models have better performance than the member models since the possible variance of the forecast errors are reduced the best member eemd vmd svm1 and combined en13 models were further compared the r of en13 is between 0 95 and 0 99 which is higher than that of eemd vmd svm1 0 95 although the rmsd of en13 and eemd vmd svm1 are both between 0 2 and 0 4 the rmsd of en13 is closer to 0 2 and lower than that of eemd vmd svm1 there is no significant difference in std between both models thus the performance of en13 is better than that of eemd vmd svm1 it is also noted from tables 6 and 7 that among all the member and combined models en13 has the highest r and the lowest mse for both training and validation the r and mse for validation of the en13 increase and decrease by 3 and 28 respectively compared with the optimal member model eemd vmd svm1 therefore en13 was determined as the optimal model for annual runoff forecasting the structure of en13 is shown in fig 13 the member models of en13 include one model based on one stage decomposition eemd svm2 and four models based on two stage decomposition eemd vmd svm2 eemd vmd svm3 eemd vmd svm4 and eemd vmd svm5 5 discussion the forecasting performances of the eemd vmd svm models are much better than those of the svm eemd svm and vmd svm models this implies that the proposed model based on the combined member models using two stage decomposition is a promising method for annual runoff forecasting however the proposed two stage decomposition is merely based on the eemd and vmd in fact other types of signal decomposition technologies such as complementary ensemble empirical mode decomposition yeh et al 2010 and discrete wavelet transform hadi and tombul 2018 can also be introduced to the hybrid forecasting framework these methods have been applied in previous hydrological studies with better effects on improving model performance in terms of the type of combining models although the adopted sam model has achieved better forecasting performance many other types of combining models including boosting anctil et al 2004 and bagging zaier et al 2010 can be further applied to future annual runoff forecasting in this study the svm with good generalization ability is selected as the basic type of member model to further improve the performance of the member model different types of member models such as the ann tan et al 2018 adaptive neuro fuzzy inference system zhou et al 2019 lstm ni et al 2020 and cnn lstm models yan et al 2021 yang et al 2021 can be introduced and coupled with different signal decomposition methods for annual runoff forecasting it should be noted that the differences between the mseavg for training and the mse for validation of most member and combined models are relatively large this is mainly because the loocv needs to use different calculation methods of performance indices for training and validation sets in the loocv each sample is selected in turn as the validation set separately the mse for validation is calculated using the predicted and measured values of 49 annual runoff samples while the mseavg for training is the average of the mse values for training sets in 49 runs this difference can be enlarged when extreme points exist in the validation set which is especially true for annual runoff forecasting in the selection of input variables only the linear correlation between the input variables and annual runoff was considered the non linear correlation indices such as the mutual information mi indices and spearman rank correlation coefficient can be introduced to quantify the non linear relationships between the runoff and the associated factors in addition it is well known that all changes in hydrological elements have their specific physical mechanisms therefore explanations of the rationality of predictors from physical causes analysis of the physical mechanism of hydrological phenomena and establishment of the forecasting model based on strict physical causes are the basic principle that should be followed in future runoff and other hydrological forecasting studies 6 conclusions in this study a hybrid model based on the two stage decomposition the svm member models and the combining method was proposed and applied to annual runoff forecasting of the pingshi station in the lechangxia basin china the original annual runoff series was decomposed based on two types of single stage eemd and vmd and one type of two stage eemd vmd decomposition multiple svm models were established as member models using different combinations of tele connected factors as inputs which were monthly atmospheric circulation indices monthly sea surface temperature data and monthly geopotential height data the simple average method sam was selected as the combining models the key findings are as follows 1 the decomposition enhances the forecasting ability of the svm member models especially the models based on the two stage decomposition have much better performances than those based on the single decomposition eemd and vmd for the member models the validation r values of the optimal eemd vmd svm increase by 20 11 and 11 compared with the optimal svm eemd svm and vmd svm models respectively the corresponding validation mse values decrease by 58 45 and 47 respectively 2 the training and validation performances of the combined models are better than those of the member models the r and mse for validation of the optimal combined model increase and decrease by 3 and 28 respectively compared with the optimal member model the member models based on two stage decomposition are more helpful to improving the performances of the combined models 3 among all the member and combined models en13 is chosen as the best annual runoff forecasting model which combines four member models based on the two stage decomposition eemd vmd and one member model based on the one stage decomposition eemd this study highlights that combining machine learning methods based on two stage decomposition can effectively improve the forecast accuracy of annual runoff it demonstrates that the proposed hybrid method makes good use of the two stage decomposition to process non stationary runoff series the nonlinear fitting power of machine learning and the integration ability of combined models credit authorship contribution

4046,after operating the middle route of south to north water diversion project snwdp the total water transfer to beijing has exceeded 5 0 km3 bringing significant changes to the water use structure of beijing this article compiles historic data from 2007 to 2020 to analyze changes in water circulation groundwater level climate factors and subsidence patterns in beijing following implementation of the middle snwdp it is found that the main current pressure on beijing s water supply has come from improved living standards the gradual popularization of water using appliances and a rapid development of the accommodation and catering industries an insar time series approach was used to map subsidence in beijing between 2007 and 2020 using satellite images from sentinel 1a b radarsat 2 and alos 1 climate factors including precipitation and evapotranspiration were estimated using the penman monteith leuning evapotranspiration v2 pml v2 product by compiling ground subsidence data for beijing and corresponding climate data the impact of the snwdp and climate factors on groundwater levels and ground subsidence in beijing were examined we identified three periods to characterize the changes of surface displacement after implementation of the snwdp as a the pre effect stage b the effective stage and c the post effective stage the contribution of the snwdp was apparent at the second stage alleviating the problem of land subsidence to some extent the ease of subsidence at different stages are accounted for 4 26 5 and 41 7 respectively in terms of the mean velocity changes based on the result of some general circulation models precipitation in the beijing region is expected to increase over the next decade implying a greater likelihood of rapid groundwater recovery however although groundwater is expected to recover in the long run climate extremes in the future could possibly challenge the success of snwdp during certain dry periods keywords south to north water diversion subsidence insar climate change 1 introduction freshwater resources is one of the important controlling elements of the natural resources and the ecological environment the beijing tianjin hebei bth region often referred as the capital economic circle is one of the principal economic and social centers of china with the rapid development of urbanization in bth over the past several decades urban water usage has increased in scale and has become more centralized demands for water due to population growth urban expansion and increased agricultural and industrial outputs have resulted in shortage of water in the region ng et al 2012b the shortfall between water supply and demand has become increasingly prominent in recent years long et al 2020 beijing is one of the eleven cities in bth where groundwater constitutes the main source water supply the long term excessive exploitation of groundwater has been identified among the primary factors contributing to the development of a subsiding funnel in the central area of beijing that has gradually expanded since the 1960 s sequential layers of aquifer and rock occur beneath the ground surface of beijing the aquifer originally captured water from surrounding regions thereby countering the weight of surface rock and soils chen et al 2017 due to excessive water extraction the aquifer s water volume was significantly reduced causing the land surface to sink by the mid 1970 s the subsidence funnel area had spread to the entire chaoyang district with a total size of 380 km2 by the end of the decade the subsiding funnel extended over 1000 km2 at a time when the annual exploitation of groundwater exceeded exploitable capacity by 50 in the 1990 s the funnel area had reached 2000 km2 li 2016 s1 demonstrated the contrast between groundwater depression cone and land subsidence center area in beijing between 1970 s and 1990 s in the foreseeable future with economic and social development as well as population growth water shortages in the bth are predicted to increase and problems associated with land subsidence will become more prominent to protect groundwater supplies and control land subsidence the government has limited the usage of confined groundwater and increased the surface water supply to the bth through the middle route of south to north water diversion project snwdp bai and liu 2018 as a strategic project in china the snwdp is designed to optimally allocate water resources and thereby reduce flooding in the south while at the same time preventing drought in the north under the snwdp there are plans to divert 13 km3 yr 1 of water from the danjiangkou reservoir to over twenty cities including those in the bth mu 2017 cheng and li cheng and li 2013 estimated that the per capita demand for water resources in beijing is about 345 m3 however the total water consumption was about 3 5 billion m3 in 2018 at time that the population has been estimated at 21 54 million this suggests that the per capita water availability in beijing is approximate 165 m3 per year in other words current local water resources can only support 10 million people in beijing which is equivalent to 48 of the existing population although the implementation of large scale water conservancy projects such as the snwdp has alleviated the drinking water problem in the region to a certain extent mu 2017 research indicates that continuing urban growth and rapid economic development increase the burden on beijing s water supply land subsidence is currently a global problem herrera garcía et al herrera garcía et al 2021 showed that there are 1 596 major cities around the world located in potential land subsidence areas which account for about 22 of the world major cities these including many metropolitans e g mexico chaussard et al 2014 jakarta ng et al 2012a beijing chen et al 2017 etc among which land subsidence in beijing has been studied for several decades bai and liu 2018 chen et al 2020 du et al 2018a ng et al 2012b previous research on the problem of land subsidence in beijing has mainly focused on the spatial and temporal dynamics of groundwater changes in the total amount of water resources the correlation of land subsidence and the use of scientific methods such as remote sensing or interferometric synthetic aperture radar insar to study subsidence changes table 1 for instance earlier studies have indicated that there is a strong hysteresis between groundwater and ground subsidence the dynamic changes in groundwater level correlate well with changing trends in land subsidence in particular chen et al chen et al 2017 found that the subsidence was highly correlated with variations in groundwater levels within the second confined aquifer layer chen et al 2020 mu mu 2017 has further demonstrated that despite fluctuations over time groundwater levels have shown a continual declining trend such that more than two thirds of the bth plain area is affected by the ground subsidence however there have been few studies concerning the relationship between snwdp and ground subsidence chen et al 2020 mu 2017 also climate extremes such as severe droughts or heatwaves can be predicted to affect groundwater recharge and usage ciais et al 2005 long et al 2013 which is an indirect impact of subsidence and how the combined effects of both snwdp and climate factors may affect the subsidence variously at different times has not been reported yet against this background the present study aimed to investigate how water diverted through the snwdp has contributed to the evolution of land subsidence patterns in destination cities in recent decades the key objectives of this study are 1 to combine information on water supply water usage and variations in water levels to better understand changes in regional water cycles and potential driven factor in the future 2 to analysis how the combined effects of water diverted through the snwdp and climatic factors e g precipitation evapotranspiration have affected the regional water cycles at different stages and 3 to examine how the combined effects of snwdp water and climatic factors might affect land subsidence patterns both qualitatively and quantitively at different stages 2 geological settings and backgrounds 2 1 geological settings beijing city is in the transition zone from the north china plain to the loess and inner mongolia plateaus adjacent to hebei province and tianjin city beijing is 160 km wide from east to west and 170 km long from north to south the western and northern parts are bordered by the taihang and yanshan mountains respectively accounting for about 2 3 of the city s land area the southeastern part is a plain region accounting for about 1 3 of the city area the plain is at an altitude of 20 60 m a s l while the mountain range from 1000 to 1500 m m a s l annual precipitation varies from 450 to 600 mm with about 80 of the precipitation occurring from june to august the danjiangkou reservoir the water source region of the snwdp is situated in china s eastern monsoon climate region which experiences dramatic fluctuations in both climate and water supply the total drainage area is about 96000 km2 annual precipitation is the eastern monsoon region is 700 to 1100 mm with about 70 80 of the precipitation occurring from may to october the long term target of diverting 13 km3 of water each year from the danjiangkou reservoir is projected to be met by 2030 this will account for 30 of the average annual streamflow into the danjangkou reservoir 29 km3 2 2 south to north water diversion project background the snwdp is divided among three routes east middle and west the construction of the middle snwdp is designed to alleviate the water resource crisis in the bth region and is therefore of great significance for guaranteeing urban water supplies improving the urban water environment and ensuring sustainable economic and social development in the region the water volume in the north of beijing city located in the haihe river basin has plummeted over the past several decades under intensifying drought conditions surface water has increasingly declined thereby causing a decrease in water flow to the haihe river basin the middle snwdp was specifically designed to alleviate these pressures on the river basin while ensuring continuing adequate water resources for development of the region development of the middle snwdp was undertaken in two phases the first phase phase 1 known as the beijing shijiazhuang section provided an emergency water supply line and was completed in september 2008 which undertook the emergency water supply task in beijing it is noted that shijiazhuang is the capital city of hebei province this allowed water to be diverted from four reservoirs by pump stations in hebei province including huangbizhuang angezhuang wangkuai and gangang fig 1 b if the water level of the past year is maintained the incoming water from the above mentioned reservoirs can fill the water shortage in beijing according to beijing water 2007 2019 a total of 1 6 km3 of water was diverted to beijing between 2008 and 2014 with an average of 0 25 km3 per year in phase 2 of the snwdp a trunk line completed at the end of 2014 expanded beijing s water supply range by approximately 700 km2 li 2016 through combined external water transfer local surface water and a groundwater multi source water supply the power of gravity is what propels the water flow from the danjiangkou reservoir to beijing without the use of pumping stations in total 5 2 km3 water was diverted by the middle snwdp between 2015 and 2019 3 methodology and dataset 3 1 estimation of evapotranspiration a dry climate would reduce the amount of groundwater recharge and increase the extraction of groundwater which is an important indirect factor that causes land subsidence guo et al 2017 hydrological drought normally occurs when there is a lack of water supply particularly in streams reservoirs and groundwater levels usually after many months of meteorological drought hydrological drought is a result of the combined effects of both low precipitation and evapotranspiration trenberth 2011 in this study annual precipitation data was obtained from beijing water 2007 2019 evapotranspiration was estimated using the penman monteith leuning evapotranspiration v2 pml v2 product zhang et al 2019 the equation is as follows 1 et e c e s e i e w where et is evapotranspiration ec is vegetation transpiration es is evaporation from soil ei is the interception from the vegetation canopy while ew is evaporation from the water body both precipitation and evapotranspiration are transformed into standardized anomalies z to provide more information about the magnitude of the anomalies under the influences of dispersion the equation for z is as follows 2 z x μ σ where x is the climate variable and μ and σ are the mean and standard deviation values respectively over years 3 2 estimation of ground subsidence using insar time series approach n differential interferograms ifg were generated with master image and the other n slave images using the conventional two pass d insar method massonnet et al 1993 because both sentinel and alos 1 have a stack of over 15 images the modified geos advance time series analysis geos matsa was applied to estimate the linear and non linear ground movement on the measurement scatterer ms pixels which consist of both ps and ds pixels the thresholds for the selection of ps and ds were based on previous experience with similar ground characteristics ms pixels with the amplitude dispersion index d a 0 15 or the goodness of fit test γ 0 95 were selected at the first stage the total number of d a or γ utilised in this work were derived as d a 0 25 or γ 0 75 the threshold determination factors ρ1 and ρ2 were defined as ρ 1 d a 0 15 d a 0 25 and ρ 2 γ 0 95 γ 0 75 the whole area was divided into 100 sub blocks within each sub block all the mp pixels were sorted by the values of d a or γ in ascending descending order the top ρ1 ps and ρ2 ds pixels were selected to build the initial network the remaining pre selected ms pixels were gradually added into the primary network using an adaptive estimation strategy ng et al 2012b for radarsat 2 dataset geos sbas was applied due to the limited amount of data available du et al 2019 an inverse distance weighted based integration module was implemented to increase the density of the ms numbers the main advantage of this approach is that it works well when dealing with a small group of ifgs for the nth interferogram the differential interferometric phase ϕ x n at ms pixel can be written as 3 ϕ x n w 4 π λ v x t n d x n b x n r x sin θ x h x ϕ atm x n ϕ orbit x n ϕ noise x n where t n the time difference between two images v x the mean velocity b x n the local perpendicular baseline θ x the local incidence angle r x the range distances between satellite antenna and topography target d x n the non linear deformation h x the dem error ϕ n a t m x ϕ n o r b i t x ϕ n n o i s e x the phase due to orbital error atmospheric inhomogeneity and noise w the wrapping operator implying that ϕzx is modulo 2π the value of vx and hx were estimated using the integer least squares ils estimator with ambiguity decorrelation adjustment lambda teunissen et al 1997 the non topo related phase was estimated and removed with a spatial low pass filter and temporal high pass filter the topo related phase was not considered due to the flat study region a detailed analysis can be found in du ge ng and zhang du et al 2020 all the line of sight los measurements were converted into vertical direction as suggested by ng et al 2012b to avoid the incidence angle interference 3 3 insar dataset in order to map the displacement over beijing city 88 sentinel 1a b iw interferometric wide data 12 radarsat 2 wide data and 19 alos 1 palsar data were utilized in this study further details are presented in table 2 a 30 m digital elevation model dem acquired from the shuttle radar topography mission srtm farr et al 2007 was used for the purpose of topography phase removing and geocoding 4 result 4 1 structure of water supply and usage in beijing followed the classification by bai and liu bai and liu 2018 the water supply in beijing is divided into five parts reclaimed water surface water sw groundwater gw emergency water supply 2008 2014 and external water transfer 2015 2019 from snwdp fig 2 a the incoming water source in beijing is very diverse which is different from other water scarce regions e g central valley in california while the latter one relies heavily on groundwater pumping jeanne et al 2019 among these sources reclaimed water refers to wastewater or rainwater that can be used beneficially following treatment to attain permissible water quality targets bai and liu 2018 sw is the dynamic water volume of surface water bodies expressed by natural river runoff and includes all major reservoirs throughout beijing gw is the water below the land surface which can participate in the water cycle and can be renewed the combination of sw and gw is called the total water resources twr de graaf et al 2014 according to moiwo tao and lu moiwo et al 2013 twr are closely related to the precipitation and its spatial temporal distribution patterns in north china region the correlation coefficient between twr and precipitation is high in beijing as illustrated in fig 4 a which agrees well with previous statement a very interesting finding here is that in 2007 gw over exploitation was a serious issue accounting for about 70 of total water consumption from 2007 to 2013 this proportion gradually reduced to 61 the rate of decline in gw exploitation accelerated after 2014 with the proportion dropping to about 37 by the end of 2019 representing an annual change rate of 0 09 km3 this has a profound effect on the land subsidence chen et al 2017 which will be discussed in section 5 fig 3 presents the trend line of precipitation and total water storage tws for 18 large and medium sized reservoirs in beijing in this figure the precipitation is presented as the mean annual value while tws is based on records at the end of the year both lines are highly correlated from 2007 to 2015 two driest years were identified in 2009 and 2014 respectively with the annual precipitation being the lowest over multi year periods sw was used to alleviate consequent droughts and this produced a noticeable decline in sw in these two years fig 4 a the water consumption structure of beijing can be divided into four parts agricultural water industrial water domestic water and environmental water fig 4 b over the past 15 years industrial and agricultural water consumption have shown a downward trend in usage on the contrary environmental and domestic water consumption have shown an upward trend bai and liu 2018 the characteristics of the evolution of the water usage structure in beijing are mainly manifested in the following aspects 1 agricultural water consumption was the largest water consumption sector in beijing before 2005 this water consumption decreased from 1 24 km3 in 2007 to 0 37 km3 in 2019 while the proportion of total water consumption changed from 35 7 in 2007 to only 8 9 in 2019 industrial water consumption has decreased from 0 58 km3 16 5 in 2007 to 0 33 km3 7 9 in 2019 environmental water consumption has increased rapidly in recent decades the proportion has increased more than four time from 2007 to 2019 from 7 8 to 38 4 and has become the second largest water use the rapid growth of environmental water consumption is directly related to an increase in the area of public parks between 2007 and 2019 the public park area in beijing increased 2 9 times from 12 101 hm2 to 35 157 hm2 beijing gardening and greening bureau 2019 the increased area of public parks requires a large amount of water but the requirements for water quality are lower than those for drinking water yi jiao chen and chen yi et al 2011 pointed out that environmental water in beijing is mainly provided by recycled water 2 contrary to the changes in agricultural and industrial water usage domestic water use increased rapidly between 2007 and 2018 domestic water consumption increased from 1 39 km3 in 2007 to 1 84 km3 in 2019 with an average increase of 0 04 km3 yr 1 domestic water use as a proportion of total water consumption increased from 39 9 in 2007 to 46 8 in 2018 and has become the largest water consumption item since 2006 it is also noted that between 2018 and 2019 the percentage of domestic water usage has experienced a quick drop to 44 8 the deep seated reason is because of the changes of the area of public parks which has increased by 8 from 32 619 hm2 in 2018 to 35 157 hm2 in 2019 as a result the total water supply has increased from 3 93 km3 to 4 17 km3 but the domestic usage did not change that much from 1 84 km3 to 1 87 km3 4 2 climate factors in beijing fig 5 illustrates the annual evapotranspiration over the last decade in beijing according to zhang et al zhang et al 2019 evapotranspiration is the sum of vegetation transpiration soil evaporation interception form vegetation canopy and the water body evaporation fig 6 a indicates trends in the evapotranspiration and precipitation anomalies from 2007 to 2019 equation 2 both original data sets present annual means while error bars of evapotranspiration reflect σ intervals during the periods of 2009 2011 and 2013 2015 beijing experienced extreme drought conditions reflected in a cumulative precipitation of 508 0 and 507 7 mm respectively consequently the sw storage has experienced a continuous downswing during these two periods fig 4 a the use of sw and gw in tandem exemplifies a modern water use structure that leads to more sustainable gw use as demonstrated by the sharp reduction in stored sw to resolve the water shortage crisis sw use has moved toward a policy of rising reservoir water storage for emergency use liu et al 2015 it is also worth noting that the frequency and duration of drought events is rising as a result of global warming not only in china but also in other parts of the world e g central united states spinoni et al 2014 central australia europe spinoni et al 2015 etc compared with the drought season 2009 2011 to 2013 2015 the latter one is indeed an intensified drought period this supports the statement by padrón et al padrón et al 2020 that the intensification of the dry season is generally caused by increased evapotranspiration rather than decreased precipitation from 2015 to 2019 precipitation levels were quite high while evapotranspiration dropped continuously from peak levels in 2015 to the lowest levels in 2019 the changing trends in the depth of the urban groundwater table from 2007 to 2019 is shown in fig 6 b from 2007 to 2014 methods of reducing exploitation had no apparent impact on groundwater change while the average water table depth in the plain area decreased from 22 79 m to 25 66 m between 2007 and 2014 with an average annual decrease of 0 41 m from 2015 to 2019 the average groundwater table depth increased from 25 75 m to 22 59 m with an average annual increase of 0 79 m also it can be seen that the gwl changes to negative values only within these two dry periods it is clear from both fig 5 and fig 6 a that evapotranspiration was relatively stable from 2009 to 2013 and began to increase in 2014 and 2015 from 2016 the evapotranspiration value gradually decreased with lowest evapotranspiration observed in 2018 4 3 mapping land subsidence using insar approaches before and after the snwdp fig 7 presents a mean velocity map below generated from 88 images taken between 07 december 2014 and 28 january 2020 after the snwdp became fully operational previous studies demonstrated land subsidence time series over a few hot spots however these time series displacements over several individual spots are insufficient to reflect subsidence phenomena for the entire region therefore the accumulated subsidence time series using all the ms pixels within the region of interest was developed furthermore multi channel ssa m ssa was used to isolate seasonal deformations from insar time series to minimize the impacts of seasonal variability followed by jiang et al jiang et al 2018 m ssa originated from the dynamic reconstruction of the time series it is not restricted by sine wave assumptions and does not require any prior information ghil et al 2002 m ssa constructs a trajectory matrix according to the observed time series and decomposes and reconstructs the trajectory matrix thereby extracting signals representing different components of the original time series such as long term trend signals periodic signals or noise signals the basic idea of m ssa is that a vector x t t 1 2 m let x lt l 1 2 l t 1 2 n would be a user defined l channel vector time series where n 1 3 m t is the time sequence number n is the length of the coordinate time series l is the vector space and l is the vector dimension there are four steps to apply m ssa 1 construction the lag covariance matrix k 2 using the singular value decomposition to calculate the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of k 3 reconstructing a vector x that consists of mainly seasonal oscillations and 4 obtaining the refined vector time series through y x x in this study the ssa mtm toolkit ghil et al 2002 which embedded the m ssa module was exploited to eliminate the effects of seasonal signals the refined subsidence time series is shown in fig 8 it can be seen that the subsidence trend may be divided into three parts separated with the red circles in the temporal domain therefore for a detailed analysis of the subsidence in the spatial domain the whole dataset was divided into three sessions and each was processed individually the linear displacement rate map 2007 01 2020 01 generated from alos 1 radarsat 2 and sentinel 1 over the study area is presented in fig 9 the reliability of insar outcomes is demonstrated by comparing with in situ measurements du et al 2018a the total number of ms pixels within the study region was about 4240666 2248962 2 570 737 and 3 093 661 derived from the alos 1 radarsat 2 and sentinel three sessions ts insar analysis respectively based on information provided by chen et al chen et al 2020 it is clear that within the study area the coverage and magnitude of the subsiding zone from 2011 to 2014 is much larger than represented by the alos 1 result from 2007 to 2011 fig 9 a this can be explained by 2013 2015 being drought years and because of continuing population growth in the area which increased from 16 38 million in 2007 to 21 61 million in 2015 representing a total change of 32 fig 10 a demonstrates the changes in groundwater level between 2007 and 2019 and their relationship with climate factors dry or wet years and snwdp contribution it can be seen that snwdp water plays a very significant role in increasing the groundwater level at various stages but it is very hard to quantify its specific contribution because the climate conditions are various in each period the combined contribution of both snwdp and climate factors will be assessed quantitively fig 10 b e shows the pixel by pixel comparison of the mean velocity between fig 9 b and fig 9 a c e it is obvious that the subsidence conditions between 2011 and 2014 and 2014 2016 are very similar while the subsidence condition is gradually eased afterwards which is clearly illustrated in fig 10 d and e in addition the mean velocity of fig 9 a e are calculated based on the common pixels which are 32 8 61 9 59 7 43 9 and 25 6 mm year respectively in other words the changes between two consecutive periods are 89 dry years mid snwdp phase 1 4 26 5 and 41 7 the ease of the subsidence is due to the combined effect of wet years and mid snwdp phase 2 respectively to better understand the evolution of land subsidence in the spatial domain the contour lines of the subsidence were generated following percedures outlined in du et al 2018b five subsiding zones are highlighted including a cuigezhuang b jinzhan c dougezhuang d liyuan e yanjiao table 3 presents detailed parameters for the contour lines it can be seen from fig 11 b and c that the spatial subsidence patterns are similar especially under cuigezhuang jinzhan and dougezhuang the general parterns of these contours are largely identical except that the averaged subsidence has changed by 2 0 cm yr 1 more specifically the largest contour line has decreased from 14 0 cm yr 1 to 12 0 cm yr 1 which occurred in the downtown region of cuigezhuang the general coverage of the subsiding regions the outline of the 2 cm contour has changed by 15 0 compared with fig 11 c the outline 2 cm contour of fig 11 d has change by 16 7 however the subsidence patterns inside have changed quite a bit the decrease rates for 4 cm 6 cm and 8 cm contours have altered from 28 8 31 9 and 57 4 to 58 1 82 5 and 93 respectively 5 discussion 5 1 discuss about the structure of water supply and usage in beijing the analysis and prediction of water supply and use structure is the prerequisite and basis for water resources management and planning water shortage has always been an important factor restricting the social and economic development of beijing bai and liu 2018 cao et al 2007 the means to resolve the contradiction between water supply and demand in beijing include water supply management and demand management water supply management refers to expanding the supply of water resources through various engineering measures to meet the needs of users for water resources this has always been beijing s priority water management method qin et al 2018 water demand management refers to the use of legal administrative economic and technological means to control total water consumption optimize water use structure provide water resource utilization efficiency curb water resource demand and finally achieve a balance between water supply and demand cao et al 2007 wang et al 2013 the structure of water supply was discussed earlier which consists of five different components in general the actual water supply is much higher than the local twr e g the average precipitation between 2007 2014 was 538 6 mm which formed 2 5 km3 of the local twr however before the snwdp was implemented the total water consumption was about 3 5 km3 resulting in a discrepancy between water demand and local twr of about 1 0 km3 this gap deficit was bridged mainly through groundwater exploitation and the transfer of water from surrounding provinces bai and liu 2018 after adopting measures such as continued over exploitation of groundwater utilization of water from the miyun reservoir and expansion of the usage of recycled water there was still a shortage of 0 45 km3 for the urban water supply each year this situation has changed after the completion of snwdp phase 2 in 2015 and the usage percentage of groundwater decreased year by year from 69 in 2007 to 37 in 2019 during the same period the structure of water usage in beijing has undergone profound changes it is noted that agricultural and industrial water consumption continues to decrease which has effectively alleviated the pressure on the supply of water resources in beijing to some extent one of the main reasons underlying the reduction in agricultural water consumption has been the adoption of water saving irrigation technologies such as sprinkler irrigation and micro irrigation systems industrial structure adjustment and technological development has reduced industrial water consumption lunwen net 2018 according to fig 4 b the current proportional use of agricultural and industrial water is at an historic low i e 9 an increase in area designated for public parks in beijing is the main factor underlying increasing environmental water consumption the supply demand balance between environmental water consumption and the reclaimed water has remained stable over the years of our study an increase in domestic water consumption has been due to continuous population growth and changes in per capita water consumption bai and liu 2018 the greatest pressure on beijing s water supply from 2007 to 2015 has come from this continuing increase in domestic water consumption and this therefore is the main problem underlying land subsidence long et al 2020 nevertheless beijing population remained relatively level from 2015 to 2019 compared to the 32 increase in the previous 8 years i e from 16 38 million in 2007 to 21 61 million in 2015 fig 2 b bai and liu bai and liu 2018 then pointed out that the increasing domestic water consumption since 2015 can be explained by improved living standards a gradual popularization of water using appliances and household bathing equipment as well as a rapid development of the accommodation and catering industries 5 2 snwdp effect on groundwater level as revealed in previous studies chen et al 2020 chen et al 2017 the groundwater level is affected by a range of factors including groundwater extraction imported water from the snwdp and climate factors such as precipitation and evapotranspiration beijing had received a total of 5 0 km3 of water from danjiangkou by 6 september 2019 beijing daily 2019 beijing adheres to the priority order of drinking storing and replenishing such that on entering beijing snwdp water is prioritively used by the public waterworks in the central urban area of beijing to alleviate water shortages which accounting for nearly 68 3 37 km3 the remaining water is used for the purpose of conserving local water sources including both large medium sized storage reservoirs 0 59 km3 12 and for the replenishment of urban rivers and lakes as well as for groundwater recharge 1 04 km3 18 since initiation of the snwdp total reservoir water storage has increased by about 2 3 times from 1 5 to 3 4 km3 between 2015 and 2019 a continuous increase in the volume of reservoir water is indicative of relatively drought free conditions from 2015 until the end of the study period in 2019 a model by long et al long et al 2020 showed that between 2006 and 2018 water diverted from the snwdp to beijing reduced water depletion in the region by 40 while a decline in agricultural water use and increased precipitation reduced water depletion by a further 30 the snwdp water supported two major changes in water management firstly it alleviated groundwater extraction by providing an alternative water source for public waterworks and facilitating the shutting down the self provided private wells bai and liu 2018 in the early days of urban construction and development when domestic and industrial water could not reach the level of centralized water supply self provided wells were a way to meet water supply needs especially in areas not covered by the urban water network however the disorderly exploitation of self provided wells would have contributed to a lowering of the groundwater levels to form a subsidence funnel bai and liu 2018 beijing has made full usage of the 68 of snwdp water by shutting down nearly 6 900 self provided wells beijing water affairs bureau 2014 and dramatically reducing the mining of emergency water resources the drinking water supplies of the nearly 2 84 million people involved were merged into the municipal water supply network thereby halting the trend in continuous groundwater decline secondly the snwdp supported a replenishment of groundwater beijing has carried out targeted groundwater replenishment work making use of the 20 of the snwdp water long et al 2020 as well as large and medium sized reservoirs to implement the ecological restoration of rivers this has effectively promoted the conservation and restoration of groundwater resources in some areas where groundwater had been seriously over exploited fig 6 b indicated that the trend in groundwater levels showed a gradually slowing in decline rates followed by a gradual increase in water levels in 2016 and 2017 however because the drawdown had reduced water levels to historic lows some inelastic surface compaction likely occured thus even with above average precipitation the recovery of groundwater levels due to uptake by parched soils has only reached 0 78 m the groundwater level turned into a clear rebound in 2018 with the groundwater level around the ecological water replenishment area rebounding more significantly i e 1 94 m by the end of 2019 the average groundwater table in the beijing plain area was at a depth of 22 59 m this indicates that the groundwater level had rebounded by 3 07 m after the end of 2014 when snwdp water first entered beijing 5 3 snwdp and climate effects on land subsidence according to many previous research gao et al 2016 ng et al 2012b population growth and economic development during rapid urbanization have led to excessive exploitation of beijing s groundwater which is the main cause of land subsidence in the area however the potential indirect impacts of climate on land subsidence have generally been overlooked long et al 2020 drought has a double impact on groundwater reduction firstly drought reduces the amount of groundwater recharge secondly to meet demands for water resources during times of drought more groundwater is extracted to make up for shortages in the surface water supply we considered three periods to characterize the changes in surface displacement after implementation of the snwdp these periods were the pre effect stage the effective stage and the post effective stage see fig 8 and the analyses in section 4 3 the first period was from december 2014 to november 2016 because the period 2013 to 2015 was an intensive dry period the combination of precipitation and evapotranspiration changes had negative effects on the land subsidence with the groundwater level decreasing by about 1 48 m low precipitation 508 0 mm and high evapotranspiration 678 5 mm values were observed compared with the average precipitation 557 3 mm and evapotranspiration 649 6 mm during the period 2007 2019 the average annual precipitation decreased by 10 from 2013 to 2015 while the evapotranspiration increased by 4 5 during this time there was no apparent effect of the snwdp the subsiding funnel areas underwent relatively little change fig 11 b and c and the 2 cm contour actually increased by 10 from 504 to 562 km2 it is suggested that within the recovery period as land subsidence is mainly caused by the exploitation of deep groundwater compression of the clay soil layer in this section was probably the principal factor underlying subsidence which agrees well with qin et al qin et al 2018 this is also supported by observations that the mineral composition of the formation is relatively plastic clay and silty clay which easily forms permanent settlement the second period was from november 2016 to march 2018 here the contribution of the snwdp begins to appear two years after initiating phase 2 of the project this demonstrates how ground subsidence can have a strong hysteresis even if the groundwater level stops declining or even rises ground subsidence may continue for some time guo et al 2019 the lag in land subsidence in the north china plain is mainly due to the long time required for the dissipation of the excess pore water pressure in the low permeability impermeable aquifer the length of the lag time depends on factors such as stratum structure thickness of the clay layer horizontal continuity mineral composition and the degree of soil consolidation zhou et al 2020 during this period precipitation was high 626 mm and evapotranspiration had dropped significantly i e by 15 to 618 3 mm this compounded with the availability of snwdp water likely contributed to the trend in decreasing subsidence at a rate of 30 especially for the 4 cm and 6 cm contours during the period the groundwater level gradually increased by 0 78 m the third period was from march 2018 to november 2019 during this period evapotranspiration remained relatively stable at 602 mm while rainfall decreased by 13 4 however the magnitude of subsidence had attenuated with the greatest increase in groundwater level recorded during 2018 i e 1 94 m the decrease rates for 4 cm 6 cm and 8 cm contours almost doubled during this time in general if annual precipitation is low surface runoff declines and the amount of water seeping into the ground to form groundwater also declines padrón et al 2020 over the past four decades 1978 2018 during periods of low rainfall groundwater tables declined the overall precipitation in 2019 was relatively small and significantly lower than evapotranspiration nevertheless groundwater levels continued to rise this was the first time in 40 years that water tables increased during a rainwater deficit given the fact that beijing s population remained somewhat stable between 2015 and the snwdp water played an important role in offsetting the effects of dry weather moreover between the second and third period the snwdp water input and evapotranspiration conditions remained similar whereas rainfall had dropped by 13 4 from 590 mm to 511 mm this indicates that groundwater levels would continue to rise during years of moderate precipitation but the water table will continue to be affected during extreme dry years e g 2009 2011 and 2013 2015 liu et al liu et al 2015 showed that concurrent drought events in both the water source region and the beijing region are likely to increase between 2020 and 2050 therefore the snwdp could face a similar situation to california s water diversion system when a severe drought occurred in 2012 furthermore a prolonged drought since 2012 in california greatly influenced the state s major reservoirs by reducing storage levels such that there was insufficient water to divert indeed in 2011 may extreme drought hit the hanjiang river and the water level of the danjangkou reservoir dropped below its dead water level for 83 days if the drought had extended the danjiangkou reservoir would also probably not have had sufficient water to divert therefore concurrent drought scenarios in the future might challenge the success of the snwdp based on previous research data long et al 2020 padrón et al 2020 and analysis from this research this paper conducts an in depth discussion on the changes in groundwater level and the law of land subsidence that are affected by climate factors and the amount of water transferred from snwdp at different temporal stages the relationship between groundwater level change and land subsidence has been qualitatively discussed and we identified three periods to characterize the changes of surface displacement after implementation of the snwdp while the contribution of the snwdp was observed clearly at the second stage however the quantitative hysteresis effect of groundwater level change and land subsidence is still unclear and needs further discussion 5 4 localized land subsidence and its future influences based on the analysis of this study and other researches on the problem of land subsidence in beijing chen et al 2017 qin et al 2018 the surface subsidence in eastern beijing shows a tendency toward the amalgamation of subsiding funnels which could affect the safety of buildings and underground pipeline networks in the area affect the operation of transportation facilities such as high speed railways and increase urban waterlogging at a microscopic scale surface subsidence is also related to the local surface load the centralized construction of high rise and super high rise buildings on the surface as well as the construction and operation of ground and underground transportation network nodes all increase the local dynamic and static loads resulting in further local subsidence this type of subsidence is particularly harmful to objects with linear structures and that leads to a question why there were frequent bursting of underground pipelines occurred in eastern beijing in recent years this is because there are uneven subsiding funnels in eastern beijing and underground pipelines particularly if they are very long will pass through the uneven subsiding sections the uneven subsiding constitutes a shearing force acting on such pipeline causing these to break the roadbed of the high speed rail is also a linear structure the flatness of the roadbed has a direct impact on the operation safety of the high speed rail high speed rail line planning and high speed rail operations and maintenance should also pay full attention to ground subsidence monitoring in the next few years beijing s agricultural and industrial water consumption will probably decrease or remain in the same level environmental water consumption will continue to increase but due to the expansion of reclaimed water production pressure on the safe supply of water resources will be small according to beijing city overall planning 2016 2035 2017 the population in beijing will be further maintained within 23 million over the long term period from 2020 to 2035 therefore future domestic water consumption is likely to increase slowly as economic levels and living standards improve this will remain as the principal pressure on beijing s water security furthermore according to general circulation models precipitation in the beijing region is expected to increase over the next decade implying a greater likelihood of rapid groundwater recovery although groundwater is expected to recover in the long run groundwater decline is likely to occur in the future during climate extremes such as droughts and heatwaves in beijing or the source region and of course subject to their magnitudes in that case the conjunctive usage of surface water and groundwater can improve water management by limiting groundwater use during drought periods and using surface water during wet periods long et al 2020 6 conclusion after operating of the middle route of snwdp the total water transfer to beijing has exceeded 5 0 km3 and caused a significant change in the water use structure in beijing this study compiled historic data from january 2007 to january 2020 to examine changes in water circulation groundwater level climate factors and subsidence patterns in beijing before and after implementation of the middle snwdp from these analyses we have drawn the following conclusion 1 over the past 15 years the structure of beijing s water usage has changed dramatically agricultural and industrial water consumption continues to decrease while environmental water consumption has increased to the historic high level mainly due to the expansion of the public park areas however over the course of our research the supply demand balance between environmental water consumption and reclaimed water has remained steady we found that the current pressure on beijing s water supply has come from the improvement of people s living standards the gradual popularization of water using appliances and the rapid development of the accommodation and catering industries 2 the introduction of snwdp water into beijing has effectively promoted the conservation and restoration of groundwater resources in beijing the average decline in groundwater levels has decreased and the problem of excessively low groundwater levels has been alleviated to some extent this has mainly been due to a the domestic water supply being supplemented by snwdp water b a large number of self provided wells being closed and c groundwaters being replenished and conserved 3 by compiling ground subsidence data for beijing and corresponding climate data the impact of the snwdp and climate factors on groundwater levels and ground subsidence in beijing were examined we identified three periods to characterize the changes of surface displacement after implementation of the snwdp as a the pre effect stage b the effective stage and c the post effective stage the contribution of the snwdp was apparent at the second stage alleviating the problem of land subsidence to some extent the ease of subsidence at different stages are accounted for 4 26 5 and 41 7 respectively in terms of the mean velocity changes however since the subsidence funnel area is predicted to remain for some time it will be necessary to continue countering groundwater over exploitation and implement groundwater conservation 4 based on the result of some general circulation models precipitation in the beijing region is expected to increase over the next decade implying a greater likelihood of rapid groundwater recovery however although groundwater is expected to recover in the long run climate extremes in the future could possibly challenge the success of snwdp during certain dry periods 5 in the future how to strengthen the combination of insar measurement and hydrogeological work in depth analysis of the dominant factors restricting the generation and development of land subsidence in different regions and how to predict and prevent the occurrence of land subsidence geological disasters will be the direction of work for a long time declaration of competing

4046,after operating the middle route of south to north water diversion project snwdp the total water transfer to beijing has exceeded 5 0 km3 bringing significant changes to the water use structure of beijing this article compiles historic data from 2007 to 2020 to analyze changes in water circulation groundwater level climate factors and subsidence patterns in beijing following implementation of the middle snwdp it is found that the main current pressure on beijing s water supply has come from improved living standards the gradual popularization of water using appliances and a rapid development of the accommodation and catering industries an insar time series approach was used to map subsidence in beijing between 2007 and 2020 using satellite images from sentinel 1a b radarsat 2 and alos 1 climate factors including precipitation and evapotranspiration were estimated using the penman monteith leuning evapotranspiration v2 pml v2 product by compiling ground subsidence data for

however although groundwater is expected to recover in the long run climate extremes in the future could possibly challenge the success of snwdp during certain dry periods keywords south to north water diversion subsidence insar climate change 1 introduction freshwater resources is one of the important controlling elements of the natural resources and the ecological environment the beijing tianjin hebei bth region often referred as the capital economic circle is one of the principal economic and social centers of china with the rapid development of urbanization in bth over the past several decades urban water usage has increased in scale and has become more centralized demands for water due to population growth urban expansion and increased agricultural and industrial outputs have resulted in shortage of water in the region ng et al 2012b the shortfall between water supply and demand has become increasingly prominent in recent years long et al 2020 beijing is one of the eleven cities in bth where groundwater constitutes the main source water supply the long term excessive exploitation of groundwater has been identified among the primary factors contributing to the development of a subsiding funnel in the central area of beijing that has gradually expanded since the 1960 s sequential layers of aquifer and rock occur beneath the ground surface of beijing the aquifer originally captured water from surrounding regions thereby countering the weight of surface rock and soils chen et al 2017 due to excessive water extraction the aquifer s water volume was significantly reduced causing the land surface to sink by the mid 1970 s the subsidence funnel area had spread to the entire chaoyang district with a total size of 380 km2 by the end of the decade the subsiding funnel extended over 1000 km2 at a time when the annual exploitation of groundwater exceeded exploitable capacity by 50 in the 1990 s the funnel area had reached 2000 km2 li 2016 s1 demonstrated the contrast between groundwater depression cone and land subsidence center area in beijing between 1970 s and 1990 s in the foreseeable future with economic and social development as well as population growth water shortages in the bth are predicted to increase and problems associated with land subsidence will become more prominent to protect groundwater supplies and control land subsidence the government has limited the usage of confined groundwater and increased the surface water supply to the bth through the middle route of south to north water diversion project snwdp bai and liu 2018 as a strategic project in china the snwdp is designed to optimally allocate water resources and thereby reduce flooding in the south while at the same time preventing drought in the north under the snwdp there are plans to divert 13 km3 yr 1 of water from the danjiangkou reservoir to over twenty cities including those in the bth mu 2017 cheng and li cheng and li 2013 estimated that the per capita demand for water resources in beijing is about 345 m3 however the total water consumption was about 3 5 billion m3 in 2018 at time that the population has been estimated at 21 54 million this suggests that the per capita water availability in beijing is approximate 165 m3 per year in other words current local water resources can only support 10 million people in beijing which is equivalent to 48 of the existing population although the implementation of large scale water conservancy projects such as the snwdp has alleviated the drinking water problem in the region to a certain extent mu 2017 research indicates that continuing urban growth and rapid economic development increase the burden on beijing s water supply land subsidence is currently a global problem herrera garcía et al herrera garcía et al 2021 showed that there are 1 596 major cities around the world located in potential land subsidence areas which account for about 22 of the world major cities these including many metropolitans e g mexico chaussard et al 2014 jakarta ng et al 2012a beijing chen et al 2017 etc among which land subsidence in beijing has been studied for several decades bai and liu 2018 chen et al 2020 du et al 2018a ng et al 2012b previous research on the problem of land subsidence in beijing has mainly focused on the spatial and temporal dynamics of groundwater changes in the total amount of water resources the correlation of land subsidence and the use of scientific methods such as remote sensing or interferometric synthetic aperture radar insar to study subsidence changes table 1 for instance earlier studies have indicated that there is a strong hysteresis between groundwater and ground subsidence the dynamic changes in groundwater level correlate well with changing trends in land subsidence in particular chen et al chen et al 2017 found that the subsidence was highly correlated with variations in groundwater levels within the second confined aquifer layer chen et al 2020 mu mu 2017 has further demonstrated that despite fluctuations over time groundwater levels have shown a continual declining trend such that more than two thirds of the bth plain area is affected by the ground subsidence however there have been few studies concerning the relationship between snwdp and ground subsidence chen et al 2020 mu 2017 also climate extremes such as severe droughts or heatwaves can be predicted to affect groundwater recharge and usage ciais et al 2005 long et al 2013 which is an indirect impact of subsidence and how the combined effects of both snwdp and climate factors may affect the subsidence variously at different times has not been reported yet against this background the present study aimed to investigate how water diverted through the snwdp has contributed to the evolution of land subsidence patterns in destination cities in recent decades the key objectives of this study are 1 to combine information on water supply water usage and variations in water levels to better understand changes in regional water cycles and potential driven factor in the future 2 to analysis how the combined effects of water diverted through the snwdp and climatic factors e g precipitation evapotranspiration have affected the regional water cycles at different stages and 3 to examine how the combined effects of snwdp water and climatic factors might affect land subsidence patterns both qualitatively and quantitively at different stages 2 geological settings and backgrounds 2 1 geological settings beijing city is in the transition zone from the north china plain to the loess and inner mongolia plateaus adjacent to hebei province and tianjin city beijing is 160 km wide from east to west and 170 km long from north to south the western and northern parts are bordered by the taihang and yanshan mountains respectively accounting for about 2 3 of the city s land area the southeastern part is a plain region accounting for about 1 3 of the city area the plain is at an altitude of 20 60 m a s l while the mountain range from 1000 to 1500 m m a s l annual precipitation varies from 450 to 600 mm with about 80 of the precipitation occurring from june to august the danjiangkou reservoir the water source region of the snwdp is situated in china s eastern monsoon climate region which experiences dramatic fluctuations in both climate and water supply the total drainage area is about 96000 km2 annual precipitation is the eastern monsoon region is 700 to 1100 mm with about 70 80 of the precipitation occurring from may to october the long term target of diverting 13 km3 of water each year from the danjiangkou reservoir is projected to be met by 2030 this will account for 30 of the average annual streamflow into the danjangkou reservoir 29 km3 2 2 south to north water diversion project background the snwdp is divided among three routes east middle and west the construction of the middle snwdp is designed to alleviate the water resource crisis in the bth region and is therefore of great significance for guaranteeing urban water supplies improving the urban water environment and ensuring sustainable economic and social development in the region the water volume in the north of beijing city located in the haihe river basin has plummeted over the past several decades under intensifying drought conditions surface water has increasingly declined thereby causing a decrease in water flow to the haihe river basin the middle snwdp was specifically designed to alleviate these pressures on the river basin while ensuring continuing adequate water resources for development of the region development of the middle snwdp was undertaken in two phases the first phase phase 1 known as the beijing shijiazhuang section provided an emergency water supply line and was completed in september 2008 which undertook the emergency water supply task in beijing it is noted that shijiazhuang is the capital city of hebei province this allowed water to be diverted from four reservoirs by pump stations in hebei province including huangbizhuang angezhuang wangkuai and gangang fig 1 b if the water level of the past year is maintained the incoming water from the above mentioned reservoirs can fill the water shortage in beijing according to beijing water 2007 2019 a total of 1 6 km3 of water was diverted to beijing between 2008 and 2014 with an average of 0 25 km3 per year in phase 2 of the snwdp a trunk line completed at the end of 2014 expanded beijing s water supply range by approximately 700 km2 li 2016 through combined external water transfer local surface water and a groundwater multi source water supply the power of gravity is what propels the water flow from the danjiangkou reservoir to beijing without the use of pumping stations in total 5 2 km3 water was diverted by the middle snwdp between 2015 and 2019 3 methodology and dataset 3 1 estimation of evapotranspiration a dry climate would reduce the amount of groundwater recharge and increase the extraction of groundwater which is an important indirect factor that causes land subsidence guo et al 2017 hydrological drought normally occurs when there is a lack of water supply particularly in streams reservoirs and groundwater levels usually after many months of meteorological drought hydrological drought is a result of the combined effects of both low precipitation and evapotranspiration trenberth 2011 in this study annual precipitation data was obtained from beijing water 2007 2019 evapotranspiration was estimated using the penman monteith leuning evapotranspiration v2 pml v2 product zhang et al 2019 the equation is as follows 1 et e c e s e i e w where et is evapotranspiration ec is vegetation transpiration es is evaporation from soil ei is the interception from the vegetation canopy while ew is evaporation from the water body both precipitation and evapotranspiration are transformed into standardized anomalies z to provide more information about the magnitude of the anomalies under the influences of dispersion the equation for z is as follows 2 z x μ σ where x is the climate variable and μ and σ are the mean and standard deviation values respectively over years 3 2 estimation of ground subsidence using insar time series approach n differential interferograms ifg were generated with master image and the other n slave images using the conventional two pass d insar method massonnet et al 1993 because both sentinel and alos 1 have a stack of over 15 images the modified geos advance time series analysis geos matsa was applied to estimate the linear and non linear ground movement on the measurement scatterer ms pixels which consist of both ps and ds pixels the thresholds for the selection of ps and ds were based on previous experience with similar ground characteristics ms pixels with the amplitude dispersion index d a 0 15 or the goodness of fit test γ 0 95 were selected at the first stage the total number of d a or γ utilised in this work were derived as d a 0 25 or γ 0 75 the threshold determination factors ρ1 and ρ2 were defined as ρ 1 d a 0 15 d a 0 25 and ρ 2 γ 0 95 γ 0 75 the whole area was divided into 100 sub blocks within each sub block all the mp pixels were sorted by the values of d a or γ in ascending descending order the top ρ1 ps and ρ2 ds pixels were selected to build the initial network the remaining pre selected ms pixels were gradually added into the primary network using an adaptive estimation strategy ng et al 2012b for radarsat 2 dataset geos sbas was applied due to the limited amount of data available du et al 2019 an inverse distance weighted based integration module was implemented to increase the density of the ms numbers the main advantage of this approach is that it works well when dealing with a small group of ifgs for the nth interferogram the differential interferometric phase ϕ x n at ms pixel can be written as 3 ϕ x n w 4 π λ v x t n d x n b x n r x sin θ x h x ϕ atm x n ϕ orbit x n ϕ noise x n where t n the time difference between two images v x the mean velocity b x n the local perpendicular baseline θ x the local

orbital error atmospheric inhomogeneity and noise w the wrapping operator implying that ϕzx is modulo 2π the value of vx and hx were estimated using the integer least squares ils estimator with ambiguity decorrelation adjustment lambda teunissen et al 1997 the non topo related phase was estimated and removed with a spatial low pass filter and temporal high pass filter the topo related phase was not considered due to the flat study region a detailed analysis can be found in du ge ng and zhang du et al 2020 all the line of sight los measurements were converted into vertical direction as suggested by ng et al 2012b to avoid the incidence angle interference 3 3 insar dataset in order to map the displacement over beijing city 88 sentinel 1a b iw interferometric wide data 12 radarsat 2 wide data and 19 alos 1 palsar data were utilized in this study further details are presented in table 2 a 30 m digital elevation model dem acquired from the shuttle radar topography mission srtm farr et al 2007 was used for the purpose of topography phase removing and geocoding 4 result 4 1 structure of water supply and usage in beijing followed the classification by bai and liu bai and liu 2018 the water supply in beijing is divided into five parts reclaimed water surface water sw groundwater gw emergency water supply 2008 2014 and external water transfer 2015 2019 from snwdp fig 2 a the incoming water source in beijing is very diverse which is different from other water scarce regions e g central valley in california while the latter one relies heavily on groundwater pumping jeanne et al 2019 among these sources reclaimed water refers to wastewater or rainwater that can be used beneficially following treatment to attain permissible water quality targets bai and liu 2018 sw is the dynamic water volume of surface water bodies expressed by natural river runoff and includes all major reservoirs throughout beijing gw is the water below the land surface which can participate in the water cycle and can be renewed the combination of sw and gw is called the total water resources twr de graaf et al 2014 according to moiwo tao and lu moiwo et al 2013 twr are closely related to the precipitation and its spatial temporal distribution patterns in north china region the correlation coefficient between twr and precipitation is high in beijing as illustrated in fig 4 a which agrees well with previous statement a very interesting finding here is that in 2007 gw over exploitation was a serious issue accounting for about 70 of total water consumption from 2007 to 2013 this proportion gradually reduced to 61 the rate of decline in gw exploitation accelerated after 2014 with the proportion dropping to about 37 by the end of 2019 representing an annual change rate of 0 09 km3 this has a profound effect on the land subsidence chen et al 2017 which will be discussed in section 5 fig 3 presents the trend line of precipitation and total water storage tws for 18 large and medium sized reservoirs in beijing in this figure the precipitation is presented as the mean annual value while tws is based on records at the end of the year both lines are highly correlated from 2007 to 2015 two driest years were identified in 2009 and 2014 respectively with the annual precipitation being the lowest over multi year periods sw was used to alleviate consequent droughts and this produced a noticeable decline in sw in these two years fig 4 a the water consumption structure of beijing can be divided into four parts agricultural water industrial water domestic water and environmental water fig 4 b over the past 15 years industrial and agricultural water consumption have shown a downward trend in usage on the contrary environmental and domestic water consumption have shown an upward trend bai and liu 2018 the characteristics of the evolution of the water usage structure in beijing are mainly manifested in the following aspects 1 agricultural water consumption was the largest water consumption sector in beijing before 2005 this water consumption decreased from 1 24 km3 in 2007 to 0 37 km3 in 2019 while the proportion of total water consumption changed from 35 7 in 2007 to only 8 9 in 2019 industrial water consumption has decreased from 0 58 km3 16 5 in 2007 to 0 33 km3 7 9 in 2019 environmental water consumption has increased rapidly in recent decades the proportion has increased more than four time from 2007 to 2019 from 7 8 to 38 4 and has become the second largest water use the rapid growth of environmental water consumption is directly related to an increase in the area of public parks between 2007 and 2019 the public park area in beijing increased 2 9 times from 12 101 hm2 to 35 157 hm2 beijing gardening and greening bureau 2019 the increased area of public parks requires a large amount of water but the requirements for water quality are lower than those for drinking water yi jiao chen and chen yi et al 2011 pointed out that environmental water in beijing is mainly provided by recycled water 2 contrary to the changes in agricultural and industrial water usage domestic water use increased rapidly between 2007 and 2018 domestic water consumption increased from 1 39 km3 in 2007 to 1 84 km3 in 2019 with an average increase of 0 04 km3 yr 1 domestic water use as a proportion of total water consumption increased from 39 9 in 2007 to 46 8 in 2018 and has become the largest water consumption item since 2006 it is also noted that between 2018 and 2019 the percentage of domestic water usage has experienced a quick drop to 44 8 the deep seated reason is because of the changes of the area of public parks which has increased by 8 from 32 619 hm2 in 2018 to 35 157 hm2 in 2019 as a result the total water supply has increased from 3 93 km3 to 4 17 km3 but the domestic usage did not change that much from 1 84 km3 to 1 87 km3 4 2 climate factors in beijing fig 5 illustrates the annual evapotranspiration over the last decade in beijing according to zhang et al zhang et al 2019 evapotranspiration is the sum of vegetation transpiration soil evaporation interception form vegetation canopy and the water body evaporation fig 6 a indicates trends in the evapotranspiration and precipitation anomalies from 2007 to 2019 equation 2 both original data sets present annual means while error bars of evapotranspiration reflect σ intervals during the periods of 2009 2011 and 2013 2015 beijing experienced extreme drought conditions reflected in a cumulative precipitation of 508 0 and 507 7 mm respectively consequently the sw storage has experienced a continuous downswing during these two periods fig 4 a the use of sw and gw in tandem exemplifies a modern water use structure that leads to more sustainable gw use as demonstrated by the sharp reduction in stored sw to resolve the water shortage crisis sw use has moved toward a policy of rising reservoir water storage for emergency use liu et al 2015 it is also worth noting that the frequency and duration of drought events is rising as a result of global warming not only in china but also in other parts of the world e g central united states spinoni et al 2014 central australia europe spinoni et al 2015 etc compared with the drought season 2009 2011 to 2013 2015 the latter one is indeed an intensified drought period this supports the statement by padrón et al padrón et al 2020 that the intensification of the dry season is generally caused by increased evapotranspiration rather than decreased precipitation from 2015 to 2019 precipitation levels were quite high while evapotranspiration dropped continuously from peak levels in 2015 to the lowest levels in 2019 the changing trends in the depth of the urban groundwater table from 2007 to 2019 is shown in fig 6 b from 2007 to 2014 methods of reducing exploitation had no apparent impact on groundwater change while the average water table depth in the plain area decreased from 22 79 m to 25 66 m between 2007 and 2014 with an average annual decrease of 0 41 m from 2015 to 2019 the average groundwater table depth increased from 25 75 m to 22 59 m with an average annual increase of 0 79 m also it can be seen that the gwl changes to negative values only within these two dry periods it is clear from both fig 5 and fig 6 a that evapotranspiration was relatively stable from 2009 to 2013 and began to increase in 2014 and 2015 from 2016 the evapotranspiration value gradually decreased with lowest evapotranspiration observed in 2018 4 3 mapping land subsidence using insar approaches before and after the snwdp fig 7 presents a mean velocity map below generated from 88 images taken between 07 december 2014 and 28 january 2020 after the snwdp became fully operational previous studies demonstrated land subsidence time series over a few hot spots however these time series displacements over several individual spots are insufficient to reflect subsidence phenomena for the entire region therefore the accumulated subsidence time series using all the ms pixels within the region of interest was developed furthermore multi channel ssa m ssa was used to isolate seasonal deformations from insar time series to minimize the impacts of seasonal variability followed by jiang et al jiang et al 2018 m ssa originated from the dynamic reconstruction of the time series it is not restricted by sine wave assumptions and does not require any prior information ghil et al 2002 m ssa constructs a trajectory matrix according to the observed time series and decomposes and reconstructs the trajectory matrix thereby extracting signals representing different components of the original time series such as long term trend signals periodic signals or noise signals the basic idea of m ssa is that a vector x t t 1 2 m let x lt l 1 2 l t 1 2 n would be a user defined l channel vector time series where n 1 3 m t is the time sequence number n is the length of the coordinate time series l is the vector space and l is the vector dimension there are four steps to apply m ssa 1 construction the lag covariance matrix k 2 using the singular value decomposition to calculate the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of k 3 reconstructing a vector x that consists of mainly seasonal oscillations and 4 obtaining the refined vector time series through y x x in this study the ssa mtm toolkit ghil et al 2002 which embedded the m ssa module was exploited to eliminate the effects of seasonal signals the refined subsidence time series is shown in fig 8 it can be seen that the subsidence trend may be divided into three parts separated with the red circles in the temporal domain therefore for a detailed analysis of the subsidence in the spatial domain the whole dataset was divided into three sessions and each was processed individually the linear displacement rate map 2007 01 2020 01 generated from alos 1 radarsat 2 and sentinel 1 over the study area is presented in fig 9 the reliability of insar outcomes is demonstrated by comparing with in situ measurements du et al 2018a the total number of ms pixels within the study region was about 4240666 2248962 2 570 737 and 3 093 661 derived from the alos 1 radarsat 2 and sentinel three sessions ts insar analysis respectively based on information provided by chen et al chen et al 2020 it is clear that within the study area the coverage and magnitude of the subsiding zone from 2011 to 2014 is much larger than represented by the alos 1 result from 2007 to 2011 fig 9 a this can be explained by 2013 2015 being drought years and because of continuing population growth in the area which increased from 16 38 million in 2007 to 21 61 million in 2015 representing a total change of 32 fig 10 a demonstrates the changes in groundwater level between 2007 and 2019 and their relationship with climate factors dry or wet years and snwdp contribution it can be seen that snwdp water plays a very significant role in increasing the groundwater level at various stages but it is very hard to quantify its specific contribution because the climate conditions are various in each period the combined contribution of both snwdp and climate factors will be assessed quantitively fig 10 b e shows the pixel by pixel comparison of the mean velocity between fig 9 b and fig 9 a c e it is obvious that the subsidence conditions between 2011 and 2014 and 2014 2016 are very similar while the subsidence condition is gradually eased afterwards which is clearly illustrated in fig 10 d and e in addition the mean velocity of fig 9 a e are calculated based on the common pixels which are 32 8 61 9 59 7 43 9 and 25 6 mm year respectively in other words the changes between two consecutive periods are 89 dry years mid snwdp phase 1 4 26 5 and 41 7 the ease of the subsidence is due to the combined effect of wet years and mid snwdp phase 2 respectively to better understand the evolution of land subsidence in the spatial domain the contour lines of the subsidence were generated following percedures outlined in du et al 2018b five subsiding zones are highlighted including a cuigezhuang b jinzhan c dougezhuang d liyuan e yanjiao table 3 presents detailed parameters for the contour lines it can be seen from fig 11 b and c that the spatial subsidence patterns are similar especially under cuigezhuang jinzhan and dougezhuang the general parterns of these contours are largely identical except that the averaged subsidence has changed by 2 0 cm yr 1 more specifically the largest contour line has decreased from 14 0 cm yr 1 to 12 0 cm yr 1 which occurred in the downtown region of cuigezhuang the general coverage of the subsiding regions the outline of the 2 cm contour has changed by 15 0 compared with fig 11 c the outline 2 cm contour of fig 11 d has change by 16 7 however the subsidence patterns inside have changed quite a bit the decrease rates for 4 cm 6 cm and 8 cm contours have altered from 28 8 31 9 and 57 4 to 58 1 82 5 and 93 respectively 5 discussion 5 1 discuss about the structure of water supply and usage in beijing the analysis and prediction of water supply and use structure is the prerequisite and basis for water resources management and planning water shortage has always been an important factor restricting the social and economic development of beijing bai and liu 2018 cao et al 2007 the means to resolve the contradiction between water supply and demand in beijing include water supply management and demand management water supply management refers to expanding the supply of water resources through various engineering measures to meet the needs of users for water resources this has always been beijing s priority water management method qin et al 2018 water demand management refers to the use of legal administrative economic and technological means to control total water consumption optimize water use structure provide water resource utilization efficiency curb water resource demand and finally achieve a balance between water supply and demand cao et al 2007 wang et al 2013 the structure of water supply was discussed earlier which consists of five different components in general the actual water supply is much higher than the local twr e g the average precipitation between 2007 2014 was 538 6 mm which formed 2 5 km3 of the local twr however before the snwdp was implemented the total water consumption was about 3 5 km3 resulting in a discrepancy between water demand and local twr of about 1 0 km3 this gap deficit was bridged mainly through groundwater exploitation and the transfer of water from surrounding provinces bai and liu 2018 after adopting measures such as continued over exploitation of groundwater utilization of water from the miyun reservoir and expansion of the usage of recycled water there was still a shortage of 0 45 km3 for the urban water supply each year this situation has changed after the completion of snwdp phase 2 in 2015 and the usage percentage of groundwater decreased year by year from 69 in 2007 to 37 in 2019 during the same period the structure of water usage in beijing has undergone profound changes it is noted that agricultural and industrial water consumption continues to decrease which has effectively alleviated the pressure on the supply of water resources in beijing to some extent one of the main reasons underlying the reduction in agricultural water consumption has been the adoption of water saving irrigation technologies such as sprinkler irrigation and micro irrigation systems industrial structure adjustment and technological development has reduced industrial water consumption lunwen net 2018 according to fig 4 b the current proportional use of agricultural and industrial water is at an historic low i e 9 an increase in area designated for public parks in beijing is the main factor underlying increasing environmental water consumption the supply demand balance between environmental water consumption and the reclaimed water has remained stable over the years of our study an increase in domestic water consumption has been due to continuous population growth and changes in per capita water consumption bai and liu 2018 the greatest pressure on beijing s water supply from 2007 to 2015 has come from this continuing increase in domestic water consumption and this therefore is the main problem underlying land subsidence long et al 2020 nevertheless beijing population remained relatively level from 2015 to 2019 compared to the 32 increase in the previous 8 years i e from 16 38 million in 2007 to 21 61 million in 2015 fig 2 b bai and liu bai and liu 2018 then pointed out that the increasing domestic water consumption since 2015 can be explained by improved living standards a gradual popularization of water using appliances and household bathing equipment as well as a rapid development of the accommodation and catering industries 5 2 snwdp effect on groundwater level as revealed in previous studies chen et al 2020 chen et al 2017 the groundwater level is affected by a range of factors including groundwater extraction imported water from the snwdp and climate factors such as precipitation and evapotranspiration beijing had received a total of 5 0 km3 of water from danjiangkou by 6 september 2019 beijing daily 2019 beijing adheres to the priority order of drinking storing and replenishing such that on entering beijing snwdp water is prioritively used by the public waterworks in the central urban area of beijing to alleviate water shortages which accounting for nearly 68 3 37 km3 the remaining water is used for the purpose of conserving local water sources including both large medium sized storage reservoirs 0 59 km3 12 and for the replenishment of urban rivers and lakes as well as for groundwater recharge 1 04 km3 18 since initiation of the snwdp total reservoir water storage has increased by about 2 3 times from 1 5 to 3 4 km3 between 2015 and 2019 a continuous increase in the volume of reservoir water is indicative of relatively drought free conditions from 2015 until the end of the study period in 2019 a model by long et al long et al 2020 showed that between 2006 and 2018 water diverted from the snwdp to beijing reduced water depletion in the region by 40 while a decline in agricultural water use and increased precipitation reduced water depletion by a further 30 the snwdp water supported two major changes in water management firstly it alleviated groundwater extraction by providing an alternative water source for public waterworks and facilitating the shutting down the self provided private wells bai and liu 2018 in the early days of urban construction and development when domestic and industrial water could not reach the level of centralized water supply self provided wells were a way to meet water supply needs especially in areas not covered by the urban water network however the disorderly exploitation of self provided wells would have contributed to a lowering of the groundwater levels to form a subsidence funnel bai and liu 2018 beijing has made full usage of the 68 of snwdp water by shutting down nearly 6 900 self provided wells beijing water affairs bureau 2014 and dramatically reducing the mining of emergency water resources the drinking water supplies of the nearly 2 84 million people involved were merged into the municipal water supply network thereby halting the trend in continuous groundwater decline secondly the snwdp supported a replenishment of groundwater beijing has carried out targeted groundwater replenishment work making use of the 20 of the snwdp water long et al 2020 as well as large and medium sized reservoirs to implement the ecological restoration of rivers this has effectively promoted the conservation and restoration of groundwater resources in some areas where groundwater had been seriously over exploited fig 6 b indicated that the trend in groundwater levels showed a gradually slowing in decline rates followed by a gradual increase in water levels in 2016 and 2017 however because the drawdown had reduced water levels to historic lows some inelastic surface compaction likely occured thus even with above average precipitation the recovery of groundwater levels due to uptake by parched soils has only reached 0 78 m the groundwater level turned into a clear rebound in 2018 with the groundwater level around the ecological water replenishment area rebounding more significantly i e 1 94 m by the end of 2019 the average groundwater table in the beijing plain area was at a depth of 22 59 m this indicates that the groundwater level had rebounded by 3 07 m after the end of 2014 when snwdp water first entered beijing 5 3 snwdp and climate effects on land subsidence according to many previous research gao et al 2016 ng et al 2012b population growth and economic development during rapid urbanization have led to excessive exploitation of beijing s groundwater which is the main cause of land subsidence in the area however the potential indirect impacts of climate on land subsidence have generally been overlooked long et al 2020 drought has a double impact on groundwater reduction firstly drought reduces the amount of groundwater recharge secondly to meet demands for water resources during times of drought more groundwater is extracted to make up for shortages in the surface water supply we considered three periods to characterize the changes in surface displacement after implementation of the snwdp these periods were the pre effect stage the effective stage and the post effective stage see fig 8 and the analyses in section 4 3 the first period was from december 2014 to november 2016 because the period 2013 to 2015 was an intensive dry period the combination of precipitation and evapotranspiration changes had negative effects on the land subsidence with the groundwater level decreasing by about 1 48 m low precipitation 508 0 mm and high evapotranspiration 678 5 mm values were observed compared with the average precipitation 557 3 mm and evapotranspiration 649 6 mm during the period 2007 2019 the average annual precipitation decreased by 10 from 2013 to 2015 while the evapotranspiration increased by 4 5 during this time there was no apparent effect of the snwdp the subsiding funnel areas underwent relatively little change fig 11 b and c and the 2 cm contour actually increased by 10 from 504 to 562 km2 it is suggested that within the recovery period as land subsidence is mainly caused by the exploitation of deep groundwater compression of the clay soil layer in this section was probably the principal factor underlying subsidence which agrees well with qin et al qin et al 2018 this is also supported by observations that the mineral composition of the formation is relatively plastic clay and silty clay which easily forms permanent settlement the second period was from november 2016 to march 2018 here the contribution of the snwdp begins to appear two years after initiating phase 2 of the project this demonstrates how ground subsidence can have a strong hysteresis even if the groundwater level stops declining or even rises ground subsidence may continue for some time guo et al 2019 the lag in land subsidence in the north china plain is mainly due to the long time required for the dissipation of the excess pore water pressure in the low permeability impermeable aquifer the length of the lag time depends on factors such as stratum structure thickness of the clay layer horizontal continuity mineral composition and the degree of soil consolidation zhou et al 2020 during this period precipitation was high 626 mm and evapotranspiration had dropped significantly i e by 15 to 618 3 mm this compounded with the availability of snwdp water likely contributed to the trend in decreasing subsidence at a rate of 30 especially for the 4 cm and 6 cm contours during the period the groundwater level gradually increased by 0 78 m the third period was from march 2018 to november 2019 during this period evapotranspiration remained relatively stable at 602 mm while rainfall decreased by 13 4 however the magnitude of subsidence had attenuated with the greatest increase in groundwater level recorded during 2018 i e 1 94 m the decrease rates for 4 cm 6 cm and 8 cm contours almost doubled during this time in general if annual precipitation is low surface runoff declines and the amount of water seeping into the ground to form groundwater also declines padrón et al 2020 over the past four decades 1978 2018 during periods of low rainfall groundwater tables declined the overall precipitation in 2019 was relatively small and significantly lower than evapotranspiration nevertheless groundwater levels continued to rise this was the first time in 40 years that water tables increased during a rainwater deficit given the fact that beijing s population remained somewhat stable between 2015 and the snwdp water played an important role in offsetting the effects of dry weather moreover between the second and third period the snwdp water input and evapotranspiration conditions remained similar whereas rainfall had dropped by 13 4 from 590 mm to 511 mm this indicates that groundwater levels would continue to rise during years of moderate precipitation but the water table will continue to be affected during extreme dry years e g 2009 2011 and 2013 2015 liu et al liu et al 2015 showed that concurrent drought events in both the water source region and the beijing region are likely to increase between 2020 and 2050 therefore the snwdp could face a similar situation to california s water diversion system when a severe drought occurred in 2012 furthermore a prolonged drought since 2012 in california greatly influenced the state s major reservoirs by reducing storage levels such that there was insufficient water to divert indeed in 2011 may extreme drought hit the hanjiang river and the water level of the danjangkou reservoir dropped below its dead water level for 83 days if the drought had extended the danjiangkou reservoir would also probably not have had sufficient water to divert therefore concurrent drought scenarios in the future might challenge the success of the snwdp based on previous research data long et al 2020 padrón et al 2020 and analysis from this research this paper conducts an in depth discussion on the changes in groundwater level and the law of land subsidence that are affected by climate factors and the amount of water transferred from snwdp at different temporal stages the relationship between groundwater level change and land subsidence has been qualitatively discussed and we identified three periods to characterize the changes of surface displacement after implementation of the snwdp while the contribution of the snwdp was observed clearly at the second stage however the quantitative hysteresis effect of groundwater level change and land subsidence is still unclear and needs further discussion 5 4 localized land subsidence and its future influences based on the analysis of this study and other researches on the problem of land subsidence in beijing chen et al 2017 qin et al 2018 the surface subsidence in eastern beijing shows a tendency toward the amalgamation of subsiding funnels which could affect the safety of buildings and underground pipeline networks in the area affect the operation of transportation facilities such as high speed railways and increase urban waterlogging at a microscopic scale surface subsidence is also related to the local surface load the centralized construction of high rise and super high rise buildings on the surface as well as the construction and operation of ground and underground transportation network nodes all increase the local dynamic and static loads resulting in further local subsidence this type of subsidence is particularly harmful to objects with linear structures and that leads to a question why there were frequent bursting of underground pipelines occurred in eastern beijing in recent years this is because there are uneven subsiding funnels in eastern beijing and underground pipelines particularly if they are very long will pass through the uneven subsiding sections the uneven subsiding constitutes a shearing force acting on such pipeline causing these to break the roadbed of the high speed rail is also a linear structure the flatness of the roadbed has a direct impact on the operation safety of the high speed rail high speed rail line planning and high speed rail operations and maintenance should also pay full attention to ground subsidence monitoring in the next few years beijing s agricultural and industrial water consumption will probably decrease or remain in the same level environmental water consumption will continue to increase but due to the expansion of reclaimed water production pressure on the safe supply of water resources will be small according to beijing city overall planning 2016 2035 2017 the population in beijing will be further maintained within 23 million over the long term period from 2020 to 2035 therefore future domestic water consumption is likely to increase slowly as economic levels and living standards improve this will remain as the principal pressure on beijing s water security furthermore according to general circulation models precipitation in the beijing region is expected to increase over the next decade implying a greater likelihood of rapid groundwater recovery although groundwater is expected to recover in the long run groundwater decline is likely to occur in the future during climate extremes such as droughts and heatwaves in beijing or the source region and of course subject to their magnitudes in that case the conjunctive usage of surface water and groundwater can improve water management by limiting groundwater use during drought periods and using surface water during wet periods long et al 2020 6 conclusion after operating of the middle route of snwdp the total water transfer to beijing has exceeded 5 0 km3 and caused a significant change in the water use structure in beijing this study compiled historic data from january 2007 to january 2020 to examine changes in water circulation groundwater level climate factors and subsidence patterns in beijing before and after implementation of the middle snwdp from these analyses we have drawn the following conclusion 1 over the past 15 years the structure of beijing s water usage has changed dramatically agricultural and industrial water consumption continues to decrease while environmental water consumption has increased to the historic high level mainly due to the expansion of the public park areas however over the course of our research the supply demand balance between environmental water consumption and reclaimed water has remained steady we found that the current pressure on beijing s water supply has come from the improvement of people s living standards the gradual popularization of water using appliances and the rapid development of the accommodation and catering industries 2 the introduction of snwdp water into beijing has effectively promoted the conservation and restoration of groundwater resources in beijing the average decline in groundwater levels has decreased and the problem of excessively low groundwater levels has been alleviated to some extent this has mainly been due to a the domestic water supply being supplemented by snwdp water b a large number of self provided wells being closed and c groundwaters being replenished and conserved 3 by compiling ground subsidence data for beijing and corresponding climate data the impact of the snwdp and climate factors on groundwater levels and ground subsidence in beijing were examined we identified three periods to characterize the changes of surface displacement after implementation of the snwdp as a the pre effect stage b the effective stage and c the post effective stage the contribution of the snwdp was apparent at the second stage alleviating the problem of land subsidence to some extent the ease of subsidence at different stages are accounted for 4 26 5 and 41 7 respectively in terms of the mean velocity changes however since the subsidence funnel area is predicted to remain for some time it will be necessary to continue countering groundwater over exploitation and implement groundwater conservation 4 based on the result of some general circulation models precipitation in the beijing region is expected to increase over the next decade implying a greater likelihood of rapid groundwater recovery however although groundwater is expected to recover in the long run climate extremes in the future could possibly challenge the success of snwdp during certain dry periods 5 in the future how to strengthen the combination of insar measurement and hydrogeological work in depth analysis of the dominant factors restricting the generation and development of land subsidence in different regions and how to predict and prevent the occurrence of land subsidence geological disasters will be the direction of work for a long time declaration of competing

4047,better understanding for the likelihood of drought occur in the main grain production zones of china is key to minimize the risk for food security especially in a changing climate in an attempt to encompass the climate variability in the assessment of drought a nonstationary standardized precipitation index nspi was established for three major grain production zones songnen plain sn north china plain nc and sichuan basin sc hereinafter referred to gpzs by means of using the climate indices as covariates then three commonly used archimedean copulas i e clayton frank and gumbel hougaard were adopted to determine the joint drought probability model using the joint probability distribution the risk of drought in different degree occurring among the three gpzs conditional joint probability and conditional return period of different drought combinations of gpzs were analyzed the results show that nspi reflected the drought conditions well in three gpzs and the copula based joint probability distributions of different drought situations among the three gpzs were reasonable for the situation of droughts encounter in two gpzs synchronous droughts in different degree are more prone to encounter in nc sc and the conditional joint drought probability return period is also higher lower in the combination of sc and nc for the situation of droughts encounter in three gpzs the probability of synchronous droughts in the three gpzs is decreasing with increase of drought degree if a specifically drought nspi 1 occurred in two gpzs the conditional joint drought probability is highest in nc then followed by sc and sn the findings of this study could provide important implications of decision making for food security keywords drought encounter nonstationary copula functions joint probability grain production zones 1 introduction drought is a recurring and prolonged environmental hazard that mainly caused by the deficit of precipitation over a period of several months to years dai 2011 drought occurs in virtually all climate zones even in high precipitation areas and impacts both surface and groundwater resources leading to deteriorated water quality crop failure and even famine across the world mishra and singh 2010 compared with other drought affected systems agriculture is more sensitive to changes in drought as its dependence on the natural environment for crop growth li et al 2019 the acceleration of global warming and its impact on precipitation affect the agricultural and food production system in different ways godfray et al 2011 researchers have formulated a series of indices for identifying and describing drought events among various indices the standardized precipitation index spi and standardized precipitation evapotranspiration index spei are prevalent in the drought researches since their advantages of being able to compare spatiotemporal characteristics of drought in different regions and to monitor drought conditions on different time scales based on spi ali et al 2019 designed a multi phase multivariate empirical mode decomposition model to attain accurate drought forecasts the calculation of spi or spei is based on the assumption that the parameters of the input variables are stationary however climate change is expected to impact the behavior of drought and this stationary assumption has been widely questioned due to the global warming and anthropogenic disturbance cheng et al 2015 li et al 2015 bazrafshan and hejabi 2018 sarhadi et al 2018 wang et al 2020a the traditional drought index needs to be modified to reflect the nonstationary nature of hydro meteorological factors recently researchers have revised the spi index by dynamizing the parameters of precipitation s gamma distribution with time or large scale climate indices such as el niño southern oscillation enso indian ocean dipole iod southern oscillation index soi and pacific decadal oscillation pdo as covariates based on the generalized additive models for location scale and shape gamlss wang et al 2015 bazrafshan and hejabi 2018 rashid and beecham 2019 the results concluded that the nonstationary spi is more robust and appropriate than traditional spi for drought monitoring in different regions across the world such as india das et al 2020 west africa giraldo osorio and garcía galiano 2012 and yangtze river basin china song et al 2020 droughts are comprehensive and complex issues that need to be characterized from a multivariate perspective the most striking feature of copula functions is that it can reflect the correlation structure of random variables without any restriction on the selection of marginal distributions genest and favre 2007 given the flexibility in the combination of multidimensional variables copula functions are usually used by researchers to deeply analyze the multi scalar drought phenomenon researches about drought and copula functions have focused on the following aspects 1 assessing the joint probability between two elements about drought by using copula functions zhang et al 2017 investigated the synchronous and asynchronous encounter risk of rainfall and reference crop evapotranspiration in an irrigation district of henan province in china sarhadi et al 2018 quantified the spatial and temporal co occurrence of dry and warm climate stresses at the global scale shi et al 2020 analyzed the risk of dry and wet compound events in yellow river basin leng and hall 2019 estimated the global major crop yield loss risk under different drought degrees 2 establishing comprehensive drought indices for example wang et al 2020b adopted copula functions to combine the spei and standardized streamflow index and proposed a standardized precipitation evapotranspiration streamflow index which can synthetically characterize meteorological and hydrological drought won et al 2020 proposed a copula based joint drought index combines the spi and the evaporative demand drought index 3 analyzing the joint probability or return period of multidimensional drought characteristic based on the copula functions zhu et al 2019 adopted a conditional probability distribution to depict the structure of dependence between the characteristics of meteorological and hydrological droughts over the yellow river basin das et al 2020 established a nonstationary standardized precipitation index and then using copulas to analyze the bivariate return period of drought duration and severity characteristics in india in addition to two dimensional features three dimensional characteristics of drought over northeast china from the point of longitude latitude and time were also analyzed using copulas zhao et al 2020b china is dominated by the east asian monsoon and will be likewise a region inclined to incessant meteorological hazards xiao and xiao 2010 during 1990 2011 human and economic losses caused by natural disaster in china reached an average of 4840 people death and 3 41 billion per year zhou et al 2013 with only 7 of the world s arable land china feeds almost 22 of the world s population piao et al 2010 food security is vital to the society stability of china data from the bulletin of floods and droughts in china suggested that drought caused grain harvest failure of 10 27 billion kilograms per year during 1950 1990 a number which climbed up to 24 51 billion kilograms during 1991 2018 bulletin of floods and droughts in china 2018 piao et al 2010 indicated that a non significant increasing trend in the area of cropland affected by drought in china since 1971 over a long period the drought pattern on the north china plain has shifted from summer and autumn droughts in the 1980 s to the autumn and winter droughts in the 1990 s and last to the winter and spring droughts in the recent decades liu et al 2018 yang et al 2018 evaluated that the relative high drought probability in songnen plain was identified during the initial stage of crop growth in southwest china almost 60 9 of agricultural area was explored to a high or extreme high risk of drought zeng et al 2019 from the previous researches numerous studies have focused on the multivariate drought characteristics in a same region few studies have researched the probabilistic estimation of the drought risk among different regions china is a large agricultural country and it is necessary to explore the joint probability of drought encounters among different grain production zones especially under a nonstationary climate the present study aims at establishing a nonstationary spi to detect the droughts in the major grain production zones gpzs of china under changing environment then using copula functions to construct links of the characteristics of droughts encounter among the gpzs finally analyzing the drought encounter risks among gpzs under different conditions specifically we would like to address the following scientific questions 1 which gpz is at greatest risk for encountering drought and which is least 2 what is the likelihood of different degrees of drought encounters among gpzs 3 does drought encounter risk grow linearly with increase in drought severity 2 study area and data according to the distribution of land use types of china in 2015 fig 1 which obtained from the institute of remote sensing and digital earth chinese academy of sciences http www resdc cn we could see that the majority of grass land is distributed in the northwest of china and inner mongolia the forest land is mainly distributed in the northeast and south of the yangtze river basin and a large proportion of cultivated land area is mainly distributed in songnen plain north china plain and sichuan basin this study selected these three major grain production zones gpzs as study aeras the songnen plain sn is dominated by a temperate continental monsoon climate with the average temperature of 19 in january and 23 in july and the average annual precipitation of 300 600 mm chen et al 2011 spring wheat spring maize and soybean are mainly crops grown in the region the north china plain nc has a warm temperature semi humid continental monsoon climate the average annual temperature ranges from 10 to 15 and average annual precipitation ranges between 600 and 1000 mm rotational growing of winter wheat and summer maize is the major cropping pattern in nc region liu et al 2020 sichuan basin sc has a humid subtropical monsoon climate with the average annual precipitation ranges between 800 and 1200 mm and the average temperature of 24 28 in summer 4 8 in winter wheat maize sweet potato bean and rice are the major crop grown in sc zhang et al 2020 due to the variation in data length for different meteorological stations we used monthly precipitation from january 1961 to december 2015 in this study there are 21 58 and 12 stations respectively located on the sn nc and sc zones fig 1 the data were obtained from the national climate center of the china meteorological administration http cdc cma gov cn seven climate indices enso soi north atlantic oscillation nao pdo north pacific

programing software the drought degree expressed by nspi is same as spi nspi 0 5 is considered as non drought conditions 1 nspi 0 5 1 5 nspi 1 2 nspi 1 5 nspi 2 are considered as mild moderate sever and extreme drought respectively song et al 2020 until this section we finished the part ii of fig 2 3 5 copula the copula distribution was used to analyze the drought encounter risk among three gpzs since copula can connect the cumulative distributions of more than two dimensional variables based on the sklar s theorem sklar 1959 a d dimensional copula is the joint uniform distribution defined as a mapping 0 1 d 0 1 for d dimensional random variables x 1 x 2 x d with continuous marginal cdfs μ 1 μ 2 μ d the multivariate cdf f x 1 x 2 x d of the d dimensional random variables can be connected by copula and expressed as 7 f x 1 x 2 x d c θ μ 1 μ 2 μ d where c θ indicates the copula function and θ is a parameter to be determined common ways of using copulas in this study included confirming the marginal distributions for each nspi series in gpzs selecting the optimal copula distribution constructing the joint distribution of multiple variables and analyzing the drought probability or return period based on the joint distribution many types of copulas can be used to construct the joint distribution of multi dimensional variables since the archimedean copulas have a simple structure and convenient calculation they are widely used in the drought researches tosunoglu and kisi 2016 zhao et al 2017 chamorro et al 2020 table 1 shows the representation of three popular archimedean copulas which are the candidates for modeling the joint distribution of drought properties in this study the parameter of the copula is estimated using a maximum likelihood method genest et al 1995 and the optimal copula function is tested by the akaike information criteria aic li et al 2013 and the root mean square error rmse zhang and singh 2006 the smaller of aic and rmse the better fitting effect of the copula the identified statistics can be calculated as follows 8 aic n l n m s e 2 k 9 mse i 1 n pe i p i 2 n 10 rmse mse where n is the length of variables p i is the theoretical frequency of the d dimensional variables which can be obtained by copula function pe i is the joint empirical frequency of d dimensional variables given that this study mainly considered two and three dimensional nspi series the corresponding pe i is calculated as gringorten 1963 11 p e x i y i p x x i y y i m 1 i l 1 i n ml 0 44 n 0 12 12 p e x i y i z i p x x i y y i z z i m 1 i l 1 i p 1 i n mlp 0 44 n 0 12 where n is the number of observed pairs x y or x y z to sort the observed pairs x y or x y z based on x variable n ml or n mlp is the number of observed pairs x j y j or x j y j z j that less than or equal to pairs x i y i or x i y i z i i 1 2 3 n 1 j i after obtaining the most appropriate copula joint distributions we can proceed the analysis of drought encounter among gpzs as shown in part iii of fig 2 4 results 4 1 nonstationary model monthly precipitation series in the three regions were averaged from the monthly precipitation of stations and used to build the nonstationary models using 2 parameter gamma distribution ga in the gamlss framework and 12 month timescale was considered in this study before establishing the nonstationary model we tested the nonstationary of 12 month precipitation series using the method of complete ensemble empirical mode decomposition with adaptive noise ceemdan colominas et al 2014 based on the ceemdan we can decompose the raw data into several intrinsic mode functions which could represent periodic characteristics and a final residual component which could represent the nonlinear trend from fig 3 the residual precipitation showed nonlinear increasing trend for sn and showed decreasing trends for nc and sc which indicating that the 12 month precipitation series in the three gpzs are not stationary as for the 12 month timescale precipitation series in each month we made a stationary model in which both the parameters of ga are constants represented as model 0 and two nonstationary models in which one parameter μ of ga varying with covariates represented as model c1 and both the parameters μ σ varying with covariates represented as model c2 based on the global deviance gd method zheng et al 2018 the performance of these three models were compared and the best one was selected by the minimum gd value from table 2 we can see that among these models the model c2 with the minimum gd values in each month for the three study areas is proven to be the most suitable model for fitting the precipitation series taking the 12 month precipitation in december annual precipitation as an example the μ t and σ t parameters of ga varying with the selected large scale climate indices are shown in table 3 and the fitting quality of molde c2 is presented in fig 4 the precipitation of sn is significantly related with soi in june 6 months lead time and nao in december 0 month lead time the precipitation of nc is stationary and the μ and σ parameters are constant 777 4 e 6 656 and 0 134 e 2 008 with respect to sc the precipitation is significantly with soi in december 0 lead time nao in june 6 months lead time and pdo in july 5 months lead time fig 4a c e also show that the temporal behavior associated with the precipitation in nc is not obvious but a noisy signal can be observed in sn and sc which seem to better capture the extreme values well meanwhile the residual plots worm plots of sn nc and sc are approximately normally distributed within the two black dotted lines fig 4b d f it demonstrates that the model c2 is flexible to provide a better description of the precipitation variability in the three different gpzs 4 2 nonstationary standardized precipitation index nspi 4 2 1 spi and nspi the temporal evolution of spi and nspi at 12 month timescale shows good consistency in sn nc and sc fig 5 this may be related with the nonsignificant trend of annual precipitation of these study zones the year of 2006 was reported as a typical dry year in nc wu et al 2013 both spi and nspi captured the drought evolution fig 5b the summer drought events in sichuan province hao et al 2017 was also identified by both spi and nspi fig 5c however during certain periods the drought severity identified by nspi is much severe than traditional spi for example during the period of 1970 1980 the precipitation of sn was under the average value and the drought condition identified by nspi is much severe than spi fig 5a although marked decreased tendencies of spi and nspi are both detected in sc during the periods of 1963 1972 1973 1980 and 1983 2000 fig 5c the drought severity evaluated by nspi is much severe than spi 4 2 2 the inter annual trend of nspi in gpzs the 12 month timescale nspi series for months of december were used in this study to describe the annual drought characteristics of the three gpzs and positive correlations were detected within the nspi series based on the kendall s correlation coefficients table 4 as shown in fig 6 a the nspi of sn nc and sc all presenting a decreasing tendency with the rate of 0 079 10a 0 196 10a and 0 298 10a during 1962 2001 indicating that the three large cultivable land areas were threatened by drought during this period after that the nspi of sn and sc shows an increasing tendency during 2002 2015 with the rate of 1 039 10a and 0 79 10a the nspi of nc still keeps downward tendency with the rate of 0 329 10a in addition the damage areas affected by drought for heilongjiang jilin provinces include sn hebei henan anhui shandong jiangsu provinces include nc and sichuan province include sc were collected to compare the correlation with nspi and drought effects from fig 6b we can see that the nspi series in gpzs show negative relationship with damage areas demonstrating the applicability of nspi to describe agricultural drought in gpzs especially for sn and sc 4 3 optimal copula distribution for nspi series among gpzs before the selection of optimal copula function the identification and determination of the most appropriate marginal distribution for each of nspi series is necessary we initially fitted four distributions extreme value distribution ev logistic distribution lo standard normal distribution snor and generalized extreme value distribution gev to the three nspi series by maximum likelihood estimation method and the test results of kolmogorov smirnov k s showed that these four candidate distributions were all passed the test at 0 05 significance level table a1 which means that four candidate distributions are all appropriate to describe the nspi series while the unique optimal distribution is difficult to determine when the data length is changed table a2 and table a3 considering that the nspi series are obtained by transforming the cumulative probability to a standard normal distribution theoretically the standard normal distribution is the optimal one we adopted k s anderson darling a d and shapiro wilk s w goodness of fit methods to test the rationality of standard normal distribution from table 5 we can see that the test results of p values of k s a d and s w are all larger than 0 05 which indicating the standard normal distribution could describe the three nspi series well therefore it is reasonable to select the standard normal distribution as the most appropriate marginal distribution of nspi series for the following joint probability analysis using copula taking the standard normal distribution as the appropriate marginal distribution the parameters of different copulas and aic rmse values were obtained table 6 the most suitable copula for the two dimensional nspi series of sn nc sn sc and nc sc is gumbel clayton and clayton respectively as for the three dimensional nspi series of sn nc sc the clayton copula function is optimal fig 7 shows the relationship between the empirical probability and the theoretical probability of different dimensional nspi series and the points evenly distribute around the 1 1 line which indicating that the selected optimal copula functions are reasonable in addition we generated 3000 pair of random data for nspi values in return for each of the optimal copula to graphically compare the performance of copula in terms of the multi combination of nspi series among the three gpzs since the nspi series are obtained after standard normalization the randomly generated data gray dots and observed data red dots are concentrated around the mean value 0 fig 8 according to fig 8 the above optimal copulas are displayed graphically in relation to different combination of gpzs the scatter plot shows that the performance of gumbel and clayton copula in reproducing the observed data in terms of mean minimum and maximum extreme values is reasonable 4 4 encounter drought risk among gpzs 4 4 1 joint return period of different encounter situations of drought the joint return period of drought events in two or three gpzs event x xi y yi or event x xi y yi z zi is expressed as t and can be calculated as follows 13 t 1 p x x i y y i 1 f x i y i 1 p x x i y y i z z i 1 f x i y i z i the joint return period of drought events in two or three gpzs event x xi y yi or event x xi y yi z zi is expressed as t and can be calculated as follows 14 t 1 p x x i y y i 1 f x i f y i f x i y i 1 p x x i y y i z z i 1 f x i f y i f z i f x i y i f x i z i f y i z i f x i y i z i where f x i f y i or f z i indicates the marginal cdf of nspi series in one of the three gpzs f x i y i f x i z i or f y i z i represents the optimal copula function of nspi series of two gpzs f x i y i z i represents the optimal copula fitted the nspi series of sn nc sc p represents the joint probability of encounter drought risk among different gpzs based on the eq 13 and eq 14 the theoretical drought return period in sn nc sn sc and nc sc were calculated and shown in fig 9 as the drought severity increases so does the return period of drought encounter situations of and in two gpzs which means the possibility is gradually decreasing for instance the t of event nspi sn 1 nspi nc 1 is less than 50 years while the t of event nspi sn 2 nspi nc 2 increases to 800 years fig 9a as for t they are less than 10 years event nspi sn 1 nspi nc 1 and 50 years event nspi sn 2 nspi nc 2 fig 9d respectively during the periods of 1962 2015 the pair wise nspi values shows that nspi 0 5 drought events simultaneously occurred in two gpzs are 5 sn nc 4 sn sc and 7 times nc sc fig 9a c and the corresponding actual drought encounter frequencies are 9 2 7 4 and 12 9 respectively which are consistent with the theoretical joint probabilities of 13 3 11 5 and 13 9 return periods t are 7 5 8 7 and 7 2 years fig 9a c to detailly illustrate the possibility of different severity drought events we calculated the joint probability of moderate nspi 1 severe nspi 1 5 and extreme nspi 2 drought events occur in three gpzs as shown in table 7 the more severity of drought event the lower the joint probability of drought encounter in different gpzs especially for the status when the drought severity changes from moderate to severe the joint probability of drought encounter situation shrinks to one half of the moderate case and the joint probability of averagely shrinks to a quarter of the moderate case as for the drought severity changes from severity to extreme the joint probability of and drought encounter situation averagely shrinks to one third and one in six of the severe case respectively for the same category of drought event it suggests that the joint probabilities of drought encounter situation in nc sc is lower but the joint probability of in nc sc is larger than other gpzs table 7 this may be related to the difference in the distribution of precipitation of the three gpzs the sn is located near the 400 mm contour of annual precipitation the nc is located near the 800 mm contour of annual precipitation and the sc is located in an area where the annual precipitation is basically larger than 800 mm zhao et al 2020a in contrast the annual precipitation variability in nc and sc may be more consistent 4 4 2 conditional return period of different encounter situations of drought taking the moderate drought nspi 1 occurs in one gpz expressed as x as the precondition the conditional probability and return period of drought occurs in another one gpz expressed as y are calculated as follows 15 p y y i x x i f x i y i f x i 16 t y y i x x i 1 p y y i x x i where p represents the conditional probability and t represents the conditional return period x i 1 it is worth noticing that the conditional p of y gpz is equal to the p of x gpz thus three conditional drought encounter events occur in two gpzs are analyzed as examples table 8 fig 10 presents the conditional probability and return period of drought events in table 8 with the increase of drought severity the conditional probability of drought event shows decreasing tendency and the corresponding return period is gradually increasing the conditional probability return period is highest lowest in nc sc and lowest highest in sn sc for instance the conditional probabilities of drought encounter events nspi nc 1 nspi sn 1 e nspi nc 1 5 nspi sn 1 and nspi nc 2 nspi sn 1 are 26 92 12 57 and 4 70 the conditional probabilities for sc sn are 24 27 12 08 and 4 95 however the conditional probabilities for nc sc are 35 17 19 29 and 8 43 respectively comparing with table 7 and fig 10 it shows that without considering any preconditions the probability of drought event nspi sn 1 nspi nc 1 is 4 27 which is much smaller than the conditional probability of event nspi nc 1 nspi sn 1 or event nspi sn 1 nspi nc 1 same results can also be found in sn sc and nc sc this indicates that under the precondition that a drought event occurs in one gpz the possibility of drought encounters in another gpz is very high on the precondition that moderate drought nspi 1 has occurred in one gpz expressed as x the conditional probability and return period of drought in other two gpzs expressed as y and z can be calculated by the following formulas 17 p y y i z z i x x i f x i y i z i f x i 18 t y y i z z i x x i 1 p y y i z z i x x i where p and t represent the conditional probability and return period other parameters are expressed as the previous formulas from eq 17 and eq 18 we can see that the conditional probability of drought encounter event y yi z zi x xi is not affected by which gpz is selected as the precondition as shown in fig 11 on the precondition that one gpz had suffered a nspi 1 drought event the conditional probability return period of the other two gpzs decreased increased with the increase of drought severity for instance the conditional probabilities return periods of events nspi y 1 nspi z 1 nspi x 1 nspi y 2 nspi z 1 nspi x 1 and nspi y 2 nspi z 2 nspi x 1 are 10 97 9 1 years 3 21 31 2 years and 1 26 79 4 years respectively on the precondition that nspi 1 drought has occurred in two gpzs expressed as y and z the conditional probability and return period of drought encounters in the third gpz expressed as x can be calculated as follows 19 p x x i y y i z z i f x i y i z i f y i z i 20 t x x i y y i z z i 1 p x x i y y i z z i where y i z i 1 other parameters are same as previous formulas the conditional probability and return period of drought encounter in the third gpz are presented in fig 12 it can be seen that the conditional probability of event x xi y yi z zi is related to the preconditions under the precondition that two gpzs have occurred nspi 1 drought events the probability return period of nc suffered drought is higher lower than that of sc and sn for instance the conditional probabilities return periods of events nspi nc 1 nspi sn 1 nspi sc 1 nspi sc 1 nspi sn 1 nspi nc 1 and nspi sn 1 nspi nc 1 nspi sc 1 are 45 19 2 2 years 40 75 2 4 years and 31 18 3 2 years respectively fig 12a meanwhile the discrepancy of the conditional probability return period in these three gpzs is gradually reduced increased with the increase of drought severity especially for extreme drought fig 12b 5 discussion 5 1 the differences of drought encounter risk among three gpzs the drought encounter probabilities or return periods are differ in the three gpzs of china this may be related with the correlation between nspi series in gpzs the results of hao et al 2019 indicated that due to the change of correlation between drought and hot extreme events the likelihood of hot extreme events under drought condition was changed the second reason may be the differences of climate conditions in these gpzs such as the distribution of precipitation and temperature the joint drought probability in nc sc is larger than sn nc and sn sc so as to the corresponding conditional probability this is consistent with the result of zhang et al 2015 who suggested that drought risks are higher in humid regions of china the annual precipitation distribution and geographical location of these three gpzs may influence the probabilities of drought encounter the convergence of cold air from the north with the warm air from the south in jianghuai region where nc and sc located may lead to precipitation sun et al 2017 so that the precipitation in nc and sc may have consistent fluctuation resulting in a higher probability of drought encounter at the same time table 7 especially on the precondition that droughts have already occurred in one zone fig 10 likewise when drought occurs in sc and sn it means that there is generally low precipitation in north and south of china and the likelihood of drought in nc increases remarkably fig 12 drought encounters in sc nc pose a greater threat to food security because one year two harvest or two years three harvest cropping systems dominate in these two zones piao et al 2010 based on the comprehensive comparison of the probability of drought events in table 7 and some conditional drought events shown in figs 10 12 we find that the probability of drought event in the three gpzs is lower than the conditional probability for instance the probability of the drought event nspi sn 1 nspi nc 1 nspi sc 1 is only 1 74 but the conditional probability of the drought event nspi y 1 nspi z 1 nspi x 1 is 10 97 6 times of 1 74 even the possibility of drought event nspi y 2 nspi z 2 nspi x 1 is 3 21 2 times of 1 74 when the precondition involved in two gpzs the probability of drought encounter is much higher the average conditional probability of event nspi x 1 nspi y 1 nspi z 1 is 39 04 22 4 times of 1 74 this indicates that on the precondition that one or two gpzs is threatened by drought the other gpzs are more likely to confront with the same severity or even much severer drought events 5 2 uncertainty of joint probability distribution the selection of statistic method may lead to discrepancy and uncertainty in the results of drought encounter risk among three gpzs taking the drought encounter in two gpzs as an example we compared the probability estimation results from the optimal copula function in this study and from the bivariate meta gaussian distribution which requires the marginal distribution is a standard one dimensional normal distribution function for variables in this study all the nspi series fit the standard normal distribution the joint probability of bivariate meta gaussian can be calculated as follows kelly and krzysztofowicz 1997 21 p x x y y x y 1 2 π 1 ρ 2 exp s 2 2 ρ s t t 2 2 1 ρ 2 d s d t where ρ is the correlation coefficient between variables x and y s and t indicate the integral variables using the eq 21 we calculated the joint probability of drought events nspi 1 and nspi 1 5 simultaneously occurr in two gpzs and compared the results with copula in this study and actual drought frequency table 9 it is clearly that the theoretical drought encounter probabilities assessed from optimal copula selected in this study is similar with bivariate meta gaussian but the copula based results are much closer to the actual drought frequency especially for nc sc researches used the copula function to analyze encounter risk problems mainly focused on two dimensional variables such as rainfall reference crop evapotranspiration zhang et al 2017 drought temperature hao et al 2017 and runoff series in two different water sources ren et al 2020 three dimensional drought risks were investigated in this study applying copula model to assess joint probability of drought among three agricultural zones of in china provides a proper prediction tool for policymakers to inform better drought relief measures and to ensure food security such as irrigation release of food reserves and food imports however the selection of marginal distribution and copula models may lead to uncertainty in the joint risk of drought for the marginal distribution based on the properties of nspi series the standard normal distribution was considered and tested as the most appropriate marginal distribution in this study for nspi series however for other random characteristic variables such as drought duration the optimal distribution should be selected and tested from more candidate distributions wang et al 2020c for copula function the symmetric archimedean copula function used in this study has only one parameter this is computationally convenient but it may lead to weak linkage effects for three dimensional variables in addition to the three copulas used in this study there are other types of copula functions can be used to construct multidimensional distribution models for example ali et al 2018 utilized 25 different types of copulas to improve the performance of probabilistic machine learning model in the future work we will consider more copula types such as t copula fischer hinzmann copula ali et al 2018 asymmetric copula functions ayantobo et al 2019 and vine copula aas et al 2009 liu et al 2015 ni et al 2020 to improve the performance of multivariate dependencies and reduce the uncertainty of joint probability assessment 6 conclusions considering the impact of climate change on drought nonstationary standardized precipitation index nspi was established with large scale climate indices as covariate using nspi and copula functions the joint probability and return period of drought encounter among three major grain production zones sn nc sc in china were analyzed the conclusions can be summarized as follows nspi can better describe the drought conditions of the three gpzs than traditional spi the drought conditions of sn and sc showed a slightly severe tendency before 2001 after that the drought conditions eased off somewhat in contrast the nc was in a state of drought for the whole study period without any preconditions the joint probability of drought events nspi 1 occur in nc sc is largest 5 58 then followed by sn nc 4 27 and sn sc 3 85 the probability of the drought events simultaneously occurs in three gpzs is 1 74 57 5 years return period under the precondition that one gpz experienced a nspi 1 drought events the probability of drought encounter in three gpzs increases to 10 97 6 times of 1 74 under the precondition that two gpzs experienced nspi 1 drought events the probability of nc is highest and increases to 45 19 26 times of 1 74 then followed by sc

4047,better understanding for the likelihood of drought occur in the main grain production zones of china is key to minimize the risk for food security especially in a changing climate in an attempt to encompass the climate variability in the assessment of drought a nonstationary standardized precipitation index nspi was established for three major grain production zones songnen plain sn north china plain nc and sichuan basin sc hereinafter referred to gpzs by means of using the climate indices as covariates then three commonly used archimedean copulas i e clayton frank and gumbel hougaard were adopted to determine the joint drought probability model using the joint probability distribution the risk of drought in different degree occurring among the three gpzs conditional joint probability and conditional return period of different drought combinations of gpzs were analyzed the results show that nspi reflected the drought conditions well in three gpzs and the copula based joint probability distributions of different drought situations among the three gpzs were reasonable for the situation of droughts encounter in two gpzs synchronous droughts in different degree are more prone to encounter in nc sc and the conditional joint drought probability return period is also higher lower in the combination of sc and nc for the situation of droughts encounter in three gpzs the probability of synchronous droughts in the three gpzs is decreasing with increase of drought degree if a specifically drought nspi 1 occurred in two gpzs the conditional joint drought probability is highest in nc then followed by sc and sn the findings of this study could provide important implications of decision making for food security keywords drought encounter nonstationary copula functions joint probability grain production zones 1 introduction drought is a recurring and prolonged environmental hazard that mainly caused by the deficit of precipitation over a period of several months to years dai 2011 drought occurs in virtually all climate zones even in high precipitation areas and impacts both surface and groundwater resources leading to deteriorated water quality crop failure and even famine across the world mishra and singh 2010 compared with other drought affected systems agriculture is more sensitive to changes in drought as its dependence on the natural environment for crop growth li et al 2019 the acceleration of global warming and its impact on precipitation affect the agricultural and food production system in different ways godfray et al 2011 researchers have formulated a series of indices for identifying and describing drought events among various indices the standardized precipitation index spi and standardized precipitation evapotranspiration index spei are prevalent in the drought researches since their advantages of being able to compare spatiotemporal characteristics of drought in different regions and to monitor drought conditions on different time scales based on spi ali et al 2019 designed a multi phase multivariate empirical mode decomposition model to attain accurate drought forecasts the calculation of spi or spei is based on the assumption that the parameters of the input variables are stationary however climate change is expected to impact the behavior of drought and this stationary assumption has been widely questioned due to the global warming and anthropogenic disturbance cheng et al 2015 li et al 2015 bazrafshan and hejabi 2018 sarhadi et al 2018 wang et al 2020a the traditional drought index needs to be modified to reflect the nonstationary nature of hydro meteorological factors recently researchers have revised the spi index by dynamizing the parameters of precipitation s gamma distribution with time or large scale climate indices such as el niño southern oscillation enso indian ocean dipole iod southern oscillation index soi and pacific decadal oscillation pdo as covariates based on the generalized additive models for location scale and shape gamlss wang et al 2015 bazrafshan and hejabi 2018 rashid and beecham 2019 the results concluded that the nonstationary spi is more robust and appropriate than traditional spi for drought monitoring in different regions across the world such as india das et al 2020 west africa giraldo osorio and garcía galiano 2012 and yangtze river basin china song et al 2020 droughts are comprehensive and complex issues that need to be characterized from a multivariate perspective the most striking feature of copula functions is that it can reflect the correlation structure of random variables without any restriction on the selection of marginal distributions genest and favre 2007 given the flexibility in the combination of multidimensional variables copula functions are usually used by researchers to deeply analyze the multi scalar drought phenomenon researches about drought and copula functions have focused on the following aspects 1 assessing the joint probability between two elements about drought by using copula functions zhang et al 2017 investigated the synchronous and asynchronous encounter risk of rainfall and reference crop evapotranspiration in an irrigation district of henan province in china sarhadi et al 2018 quantified the spatial and temporal co occurrence of dry and warm climate stresses at the global scale shi et al 2020 analyzed the risk of dry and wet compound events in yellow river basin leng and hall 2019 estimated the global major crop yield loss risk under different drought degrees 2 establishing comprehensive drought indices for example wang et al 2020b adopted copula functions to combine the spei and standardized streamflow index and proposed a standardized precipitation evapotranspiration streamflow index which can synthetically characterize meteorological and hydrological drought won et al 2020 proposed a copula based joint drought index combines the spi and the evaporative demand drought index 3 analyzing the joint probability or return period of multidimensional drought characteristic based on the copula functions zhu et al 2019 adopted a conditional probability distribution to depict the structure of dependence between the characteristics of meteorological and hydrological droughts over the yellow river basin das et al 2020 established a nonstationary standardized precipitation index and then using copulas to analyze the bivariate return period of drought duration and severity characteristics in india in addition to two dimensional features three dimensional characteristics of drought over northeast china from the point of longitude latitude and time were also analyzed using copulas zhao et al 2020b china is dominated by the east asian monsoon and will be likewise a region inclined to incessant meteorological hazards xiao and xiao 2010 during 1990 2011 human and economic losses caused by natural disaster in china reached an average of 4840 people death and 3 41 billion per year zhou et al 2013 with only 7 of the world s arable land china feeds almost 22 of the world s population piao et al 2010 food security is vital to the society stability of china data from the bulletin of floods and droughts in china suggested that drought caused grain harvest failure of 10 27 billion kilograms per year during 1950 1990 a number which climbed up to 24 51 billion kilograms during 1991 2018 bulletin of floods and droughts in china 2018 piao et al 2010 indicated that a non significant increasing trend in the area of cropland affected by drought in china since 1971 over a long period the drought pattern on the north china plain has shifted from summer and autumn droughts in the 1980 s to the autumn and winter droughts in the 1990 s and last to the winter and spring droughts in the recent decades liu et al 2018 yang et al 2018 evaluated that the relative high drought probability in songnen plain was identified during the initial stage of crop growth in southwest china almost 60 9 of agricultural area was explored to a high or extreme high risk of drought zeng et al 2019 from the previous researches numerous studies have focused on the multivariate drought characteristics in a same region few studies have researched the probabilistic estimation of the drought risk among different regions china is a large agricultural country and it is necessary to explore the joint probability of drought encounters among different grain production zones especially under a nonstationary climate the present study aims at establishing a nonstationary spi to detect the droughts in the major grain production zones gpzs of china under changing environment then using copula functions to construct links of the characteristics of droughts encounter among the gpzs finally analyzing the drought encounter risks among gpzs under different conditions specifically we would like to address the following scientific questions 1 which gpz is at greatest risk for encountering drought and which is least 2 what is the likelihood of different degrees of drought encounters among gpzs 3 does drought encounter risk grow linearly with increase in drought severity 2 study area and data according to the distribution of land use types of china in 2015 fig 1 which obtained from the institute of remote sensing and digital earth chinese academy of sciences http www resdc cn we could see that the majority of grass land is distributed in the northwest of china and inner mongolia the forest land is mainly distributed in the northeast and south of the yangtze river basin and a large proportion of cultivated land area is mainly distributed in songnen plain north china plain and sichuan basin this study selected these three major grain production zones gpzs as study aeras the songnen plain sn is dominated by a temperate continental monsoon climate with the average temperature of 19 in january and 23 in july and the average annual precipitation of 300 600 mm chen et al 2011 spring wheat spring maize and soybean are mainly crops grown in the region the north china plain nc has a warm temperature semi humid continental monsoon climate the average annual temperature ranges from 10 to 15 and average annual precipitation ranges between 600 and 1000 mm rotational growing of winter wheat and summer maize is the major cropping pattern in nc region liu et al 2020 sichuan basin sc has a humid subtropical monsoon climate with the average annual precipitation ranges between 800 and 1200 mm and the average temperature of 24 28 in summer 4 8 in winter wheat maize sweet potato bean and rice are the major crop grown in sc zhang et al 2020 due to the variation in data length for different meteorological stations we used monthly precipitation from january 1961 to december 2015 in this study there are 21 58 and 12 stations respectively located on the sn nc and sc zones fig 1 the data were obtained from the national climate center of the china meteorological administration http cdc cma gov cn seven climate indices enso soi north atlantic oscillation nao pdo north pacific

each climate index we used kendall s correlation coefficient davis and chen 2007 to test the correlations of the 13 sets of c m l w with p m w at 95 confidence level finally we selected the maximum absolute correlation value for each climate index to constitute a matrix c i c 1 m l w c 2 m l w c 7 m l w as primary covariates prepared for the establishment of nonstationary standardized

and extreme drought respectively song et al 2020 until this section we finished the part ii of fig 2 3 5 copula the copula distribution was used to analyze the drought encounter risk among three gpzs since copula can connect the cumulative distributions of more than two dimensional variables based on the sklar s theorem sklar 1959 a d dimensional copula is the joint uniform distribution defined as a mapping 0 1 d 0 1 for d dimensional random variables x 1 x 2 x d with continuous marginal cdfs μ 1 μ 2 μ d the multivariate cdf f x 1 x 2 x d of the d dimensional random variables can be connected by copula and expressed as 7 f x 1 x 2 x d c θ μ 1 μ 2 μ d where c θ indicates the copula function and θ is a parameter to be determined common ways of using copulas in this study included confirming the marginal distributions for each nspi series in gpzs selecting the optimal copula distribution constructing the joint distribution of multiple variables and analyzing the drought probability or return period based on the joint distribution many types of copulas can be used to construct the joint distribution of multi dimensional variables since the archimedean copulas have a simple structure and convenient calculation they are widely used in the drought researches tosunoglu and kisi 2016 zhao et al 2017 chamorro et al 2020 table 1 shows the representation of three popular archimedean copulas which are the candidates for modeling the joint distribution of drought properties in this study the parameter of the copula is estimated using a maximum likelihood method genest et al 1995 and the optimal copula function is tested by the akaike information criteria aic li et al 2013 and the root mean square error rmse zhang and singh 2006 the smaller of aic and rmse the better fitting effect of the copula the identified statistics can be calculated as follows 8 aic n l n m s e 2 k 9 mse i 1 n pe i p i 2 n 10 rmse mse where n is the length of variables p i is the theoretical frequency of the d dimensional variables which can be obtained by copula function pe i is the joint empirical frequency of d dimensional variables given that this study mainly considered two and three dimensional nspi series the corresponding pe i is calculated as gringorten 1963 11 p e x i y i p x x i y y i m 1 i l 1 i n ml 0 44 n 0 12 12 p e x i y i z i p x x i y y i z z i m 1 i l 1 i p 1 i n mlp

less than or equal to pairs x i y i or x i y i z i i 1 2 3 n 1 j i after obtaining the most appropriate copula joint distributions we can proceed the analysis of drought encounter among gpzs as shown in part iii of fig 2 4 results 4 1 nonstationary model monthly precipitation series in the three regions were averaged from the monthly precipitation of stations and used to build the nonstationary models using 2 parameter gamma distribution ga in the gamlss framework and 12 month timescale was considered in this study before establishing the nonstationary model we tested the nonstationary of 12 month precipitation series using the method of complete ensemble empirical mode decomposition with adaptive noise ceemdan colominas et al 2014 based on the ceemdan we can decompose the raw data into several intrinsic mode functions which could represent periodic characteristics and a final residual component which could represent the nonlinear trend from fig 3 the residual precipitation showed nonlinear increasing trend for sn and showed decreasing trends for nc and sc which indicating that the 12 month precipitation series in the three gpzs are not stationary as for the 12 month timescale precipitation series in each month we made a stationary model in which both the parameters of ga are constants represented as model 0 and two nonstationary models in which one parameter μ of ga varying with covariates represented as model c1 and both the parameters μ σ varying with covariates represented as model c2 based on the global deviance gd method zheng et al 2018 the performance of these three models were compared and the best one was selected by the minimum gd value from table 2 we can see that among these models the model c2 with the minimum gd values in each month for the three study areas is proven to be the most suitable model for fitting the precipitation series taking the 12 month precipitation in december annual precipitation as an example the μ t and σ t parameters of ga varying with the selected large scale climate indices are shown in table 3 and the fitting quality of molde c2 is presented in fig 4 the precipitation of sn is significantly related with soi in june 6 months lead time and nao in december 0 month lead time the precipitation of nc is stationary and the μ and σ parameters are constant 777 4 e 6 656 and 0 134 e 2 008 with respect to sc the precipitation is significantly with soi in december 0 lead time nao in june 6 months lead time and pdo in july 5 months lead time fig 4a c e also show that the temporal behavior associated with the precipitation in nc is not obvious but a noisy signal can be observed in sn and sc which seem to better capture the extreme values well meanwhile the residual plots worm plots of sn nc and sc are approximately normally distributed within the two black dotted lines fig 4b d f it demonstrates that the model c2 is flexible to provide a better description of the precipitation variability in the three different gpzs 4 2 nonstationary standardized precipitation index nspi 4 2 1 spi and nspi the temporal evolution of spi and nspi at 12 month timescale shows good consistency in sn nc and sc fig 5 this may be related with the nonsignificant trend of annual precipitation of these study zones the year of 2006 was reported as a typical dry year in nc wu et al 2013 both spi and nspi captured the drought evolution fig 5b the summer drought events in sichuan province hao et al 2017 was also identified by both spi and nspi fig 5c however during certain periods the drought severity identified by nspi is much severe than traditional spi for example during the period of 1970 1980 the precipitation of sn was under the average value and the drought condition identified by nspi is much severe than spi fig 5a although marked decreased tendencies of spi and nspi are both detected in sc during the periods of 1963 1972 1973 1980 and 1983 2000 fig 5c the drought severity evaluated by nspi is much severe than spi 4 2 2 the inter annual trend of nspi in gpzs the 12 month timescale nspi series for months of december were used in this study to describe the annual drought characteristics of the three gpzs and positive correlations were detected within the nspi series based on the kendall s correlation coefficients table 4 as shown in fig 6 a the nspi of sn nc and sc all presenting a decreasing tendency with the rate of 0 079 10a 0 196 10a and 0 298 10a during 1962 2001 indicating that the three large cultivable land areas were threatened by drought during this period after that the nspi of sn and sc shows an increasing tendency during 2002 2015 with the rate of 1 039 10a and 0 79 10a the nspi of nc still keeps downward tendency with the rate of 0 329 10a in addition the damage areas affected by drought for heilongjiang jilin provinces include sn hebei henan anhui shandong jiangsu provinces include nc and sichuan province include sc were collected to compare the correlation with nspi and drought effects from fig 6b we can see that the nspi series in gpzs show negative relationship with damage areas demonstrating the applicability of nspi to describe agricultural drought in gpzs especially for sn and sc 4 3 optimal copula distribution for nspi series among gpzs before the selection of optimal copula function the identification and determination of the most appropriate marginal distribution for each of nspi series is necessary we initially fitted four distributions extreme value distribution ev logistic distribution lo standard normal distribution snor and generalized extreme value distribution gev to the three nspi series by maximum likelihood estimation method and the test results of kolmogorov smirnov k s showed that these four candidate distributions were all passed the test at 0 05 significance level table a1 which means that four candidate distributions are all appropriate to describe the nspi series while the unique optimal distribution is difficult to determine when the data length is changed table a2 and table a3 considering that the nspi series are obtained by transforming the cumulative probability to a standard normal distribution theoretically the standard normal distribution is the optimal one we adopted k s anderson darling a d and shapiro wilk s w goodness of fit methods to test the rationality of standard normal distribution from table 5 we can see that the test results of p values of k s a d and s w are all larger than 0 05 which indicating the standard normal distribution could describe the three nspi series well therefore it is reasonable to select the standard normal distribution as the most appropriate marginal distribution of nspi series for the following joint probability analysis using copula taking the standard normal distribution as the appropriate marginal distribution the parameters of different copulas and aic rmse values were obtained table 6 the most suitable copula for the two dimensional nspi series of sn nc sn sc and nc sc is gumbel clayton and clayton respectively as for the three dimensional nspi series of sn nc sc the clayton copula function is optimal fig 7 shows the relationship between the empirical probability and the theoretical probability of different dimensional nspi series and the points evenly distribute around the 1 1 line which indicating that the selected optimal copula functions are reasonable in addition we generated 3000 pair of random data for nspi values in return for each of the optimal copula to graphically compare the performance of copula in terms of the multi combination of nspi series among the three gpzs since the nspi series are obtained after standard normalization the randomly generated data gray dots and observed data red dots are concentrated around the mean value 0 fig 8 according to fig 8 the above optimal copulas are displayed graphically in relation to different combination of gpzs the scatter plot shows that the performance of gumbel and clayton copula in reproducing the observed data in terms of mean minimum and maximum extreme values is reasonable 4 4 encounter drought risk among gpzs 4 4 1 joint return period of different encounter situations of drought the joint return period of drought events in two or three gpzs event x xi y yi or event x xi y yi z zi is expressed as t and can be calculated as follows 13 t 1 p x x i y y i 1 f x i y i 1 p x x i y y i z z i 1 f x i y i z i the joint return period of drought events in two or three gpzs event x xi y yi or event x xi y yi z zi is expressed as t and can be calculated as follows 14 t 1 p x x i y y i 1 f x i f y i f x i y i 1 p x x i y y i z z i 1 f x i f y i f z i f x i y i f x i z i f y i z i f x i y i z i where f x i f y i or f z i indicates the marginal cdf of nspi series in one of the three gpzs f x i y i f x i z i or f y i z i represents the optimal copula function of nspi series of two gpzs f x i y i z i represents the optimal copula fitted the nspi series of sn nc sc p represents the joint probability of encounter drought risk among different gpzs based on the eq 13 and eq 14 the theoretical drought return period in sn nc sn sc and nc sc were calculated and shown in fig 9 as the drought severity increases so does the return period of drought encounter situations of and in two gpzs which means the possibility is gradually decreasing for instance the t of event nspi sn 1 nspi nc 1 is less than 50 years while the t of event nspi sn 2 nspi nc 2 increases to 800 years fig 9a as for t they are less than 10 years event nspi sn 1 nspi nc 1 and 50 years event nspi sn 2 nspi nc 2 fig 9d respectively during the periods of 1962 2015 the pair wise nspi values shows that nspi 0 5 drought events simultaneously occurred in two gpzs are 5 sn nc 4 sn sc and 7 times nc sc fig 9a c and the corresponding actual drought encounter frequencies are 9 2 7 4 and 12 9 respectively which are consistent with the theoretical joint probabilities of 13 3 11 5 and 13 9 return periods t are 7 5 8 7 and 7 2 years fig 9a c to detailly illustrate the possibility of different severity drought events we calculated the joint probability of moderate nspi 1 severe nspi 1 5 and extreme nspi 2 drought events occur in three gpzs as shown in table 7 the more severity of drought event the lower the joint probability of drought encounter in different gpzs especially for the status when the drought severity changes from moderate to severe the joint probability of drought encounter situation shrinks to one half of the moderate case and the joint probability of averagely shrinks to a quarter of the moderate case as for the drought severity changes from severity to extreme the joint probability of and drought encounter situation averagely shrinks to one third and one in six of the severe case respectively for the same category of drought event it suggests that the joint probabilities of drought encounter situation in nc sc is lower but the joint probability of in nc sc is larger than other gpzs table 7 this may be related to the difference in the distribution of precipitation of the three gpzs the sn is located near the 400 mm contour of annual precipitation the nc is located near the 800 mm contour of annual precipitation and the sc is located in an area where the annual precipitation is basically larger than 800 mm zhao et al 2020a in contrast the annual precipitation variability in nc and sc may be more consistent 4 4 2 conditional return period of different encounter situations of drought taking the moderate drought nspi 1 occurs in one gpz expressed as x as the precondition the conditional probability and return period of drought occurs in another one gpz expressed as y are calculated as follows 15 p y y i x x i f x i y i f x i 16 t y y i x x i 1 p y y i x x i where p represents the conditional probability and t represents the conditional return period x i 1 it is worth noticing that the conditional p of y gpz is equal to the p of x gpz thus three conditional drought encounter events occur in two gpzs are analyzed as examples table 8 fig 10 presents the conditional probability and return period of drought events in table 8 with the increase of drought severity the conditional probability of drought event shows decreasing tendency and the corresponding return period is gradually increasing the conditional probability return period is highest lowest in nc sc and lowest highest in sn sc for instance the conditional probabilities of drought encounter events nspi nc 1 nspi sn 1 e nspi nc 1 5 nspi sn 1 and nspi nc 2 nspi sn 1 are 26 92 12 57 and 4 70 the conditional probabilities for sc sn are 24 27 12 08 and 4 95 however the conditional probabilities for nc sc are 35 17 19 29 and 8 43 respectively comparing with table 7 and fig 10 it shows that without considering any preconditions the probability of drought event nspi sn 1 nspi nc 1 is 4 27 which is much smaller than the conditional probability of event nspi nc 1 nspi sn 1 or event nspi sn 1 nspi nc 1 same results can also be found in sn sc and nc sc this indicates that under the precondition that a drought event occurs in one gpz the possibility of drought encounters in another gpz is very high on the precondition that moderate drought nspi 1 has occurred in one gpz expressed as x the conditional probability and return period of drought in other two gpzs expressed as y and z can be calculated by the following formulas 17 p y y i z z i x x i f x i y i z i f x i 18 t y y i z z i x x i 1 p y y i z z i x x i where p and t represent the conditional probability and return period other parameters are expressed as the previous formulas from eq 17 and eq 18 we can see that the conditional probability of drought encounter event y yi z zi x xi is not affected by which gpz is selected as the precondition as shown in fig 11 on the precondition that one gpz had suffered a nspi 1 drought event the conditional probability return period of the other two gpzs decreased increased with the increase of drought severity for instance the conditional probabilities return periods of events nspi y 1 nspi z 1 nspi x 1 nspi y 2 nspi z 1 nspi x 1 and nspi y 2 nspi z 2 nspi x 1 are 10 97 9 1 years 3 21 31 2 years and 1 26 79 4 years respectively on the precondition that nspi 1 drought has occurred in two gpzs expressed as y and z the conditional probability and return period of drought encounters in the third gpz expressed as x can be calculated as follows 19 p x x i y y i z z i f x i y i z i f y i z i 20 t x x i y y i z z i 1 p x x i y y i z z i where y i z i 1 other parameters are same as previous formulas the conditional probability and return period of drought encounter in the third gpz are presented in fig 12 it can be seen that the conditional probability of event x xi y yi z zi is related to the preconditions under the precondition that two gpzs have occurred nspi 1 drought events the probability return period of nc suffered drought is higher lower than that of sc and sn for instance the conditional probabilities return periods of events nspi nc 1 nspi sn 1 nspi sc 1 nspi sc 1 nspi sn 1 nspi nc 1 and nspi sn 1 nspi nc 1 nspi sc 1 are 45 19 2 2 years 40 75 2 4 years and 31 18 3 2 years respectively fig 12a meanwhile the discrepancy of the conditional probability return period in these three gpzs is gradually reduced increased with the increase of drought severity especially for extreme drought fig 12b 5 discussion 5 1 the differences of drought encounter risk among three gpzs the drought encounter probabilities or return periods are differ in the three gpzs of china this may be related with the correlation between nspi series in gpzs the results of hao et al 2019 indicated that due to the change of correlation between drought and hot extreme events the likelihood of hot extreme events under drought condition was changed the second reason may be the differences of climate conditions in these gpzs such as the distribution of precipitation and temperature the joint drought probability in nc sc is larger than sn nc and sn sc so as to the corresponding conditional probability this is consistent with the result of zhang et al 2015 who suggested that drought risks are higher in humid regions of china the annual precipitation distribution and geographical location of these three gpzs may influence the probabilities of drought encounter the convergence of cold air from the north with the warm air from the south in jianghuai region where nc and sc located may lead to precipitation sun et al 2017 so that the precipitation in nc and sc may have consistent fluctuation resulting in a higher probability of drought encounter at the same time table 7 especially on the precondition that droughts have already occurred in one zone fig 10 likewise when drought occurs in sc and sn it means that there is generally low precipitation in north and south of china and the likelihood of drought in nc increases remarkably fig 12 drought encounters in sc nc pose a greater threat to food security because one year two harvest or two years three harvest cropping systems dominate in these two zones piao et al 2010 based on the comprehensive comparison of the probability of drought events in table 7 and some conditional drought events shown in figs 10 12 we find that the probability of drought event in the three gpzs is lower than the conditional probability for instance the probability of the drought event nspi sn 1 nspi nc 1 nspi sc 1 is only 1 74 but the conditional probability of the drought event nspi y 1 nspi z 1 nspi x 1 is 10 97 6 times of 1 74 even the possibility of drought event nspi y 2 nspi z 2 nspi x 1 is 3 21 2 times of 1 74 when the precondition involved in two gpzs the probability of drought encounter is much higher the average conditional probability of event nspi x 1 nspi y 1 nspi z 1 is 39 04 22 4 times of 1 74 this indicates that on the precondition that one or two gpzs is threatened by drought the other gpzs are more likely to confront with the same severity or even much severer drought events 5 2 uncertainty of joint probability distribution the selection of statistic method may lead to discrepancy and uncertainty in the results of drought encounter risk among three gpzs taking the drought encounter in two gpzs as an example we compared the probability estimation results from the optimal copula function in this study and from the bivariate meta gaussian distribution which requires the marginal distribution is a standard one dimensional normal distribution function for variables in this study all the nspi series fit the standard normal distribution the joint probability of bivariate meta gaussian can be calculated as follows kelly and krzysztofowicz 1997 21 p x x y y x y 1 2 π 1 ρ 2 exp s 2 2 ρ s t t 2 2 1 ρ 2 d s d t where ρ is the correlation coefficient between variables x and y s and t indicate the integral variables using the eq 21 we calculated the joint probability of drought events nspi 1 and nspi 1 5 simultaneously occurr in two gpzs and compared the results with copula in this study and actual drought frequency table 9 it is clearly that the theoretical drought encounter probabilities assessed from optimal copula selected in this study is similar with bivariate meta gaussian but the copula based results are much closer to the actual drought frequency especially for nc sc researches used the copula function to analyze encounter risk problems mainly focused on two dimensional variables such as rainfall reference crop evapotranspiration zhang et al 2017 drought temperature hao et al 2017 and runoff series in two different water sources ren et al 2020 three dimensional drought risks were investigated in this study applying copula model to assess joint probability of drought among three agricultural zones of in china provides a proper prediction tool for policymakers to inform better drought relief measures and to ensure food security such as irrigation release of food reserves and food imports however the selection of marginal distribution and copula models may lead to uncertainty in the joint risk of drought for the marginal distribution based on the properties of nspi series the standard normal distribution was considered and tested as the most appropriate marginal distribution in this study for nspi series however for other random characteristic variables such as drought duration the optimal distribution should be selected and tested from more candidate distributions wang et al 2020c for copula function the symmetric archimedean copula function used in this study has only one parameter this is computationally convenient but it may lead to weak linkage effects for three dimensional variables in addition to the three copulas used in this study there are other types of copula functions can be used to construct multidimensional distribution models for example ali et al 2018 utilized 25 different types of copulas to improve the performance of probabilistic machine learning model in the future work we will consider more copula types such as t copula fischer hinzmann copula ali et al 2018 asymmetric copula functions ayantobo et al 2019 and vine copula aas et al 2009 liu et al 2015 ni et al 2020 to improve the performance of multivariate dependencies and reduce the uncertainty of joint probability assessment 6 conclusions considering the impact of climate change on drought nonstationary standardized precipitation index nspi was established with large scale climate indices as covariate using nspi and copula functions the joint probability and return period of drought encounter among three major grain production zones sn nc sc in china were analyzed the conclusions can be summarized as follows nspi can better describe the drought conditions of the three gpzs than traditional spi the drought conditions of sn and sc showed a slightly severe tendency before 2001 after that the drought conditions eased off somewhat in contrast the nc was in a state of drought for the whole study period without any preconditions the joint probability of drought events nspi 1 occur in nc sc is largest 5 58 then followed by sn nc 4 27 and sn sc 3 85 the probability of the drought events simultaneously occurs in three gpzs is 1 74 57 5 years return period under the precondition that one gpz experienced a nspi 1 drought events the probability of drought encounter in three gpzs increases to 10 97 6 times of 1 74 under the precondition that two gpzs experienced nspi 1 drought events the probability of nc is highest and increases to 45 19 26 times of 1 74 then followed by sc

4048,soil erosion on spoil heaps is one of the global environmental issues where grass recovery is often implemented however information regarding how the erosion processes and control efficiency on spoil heaps differ as functions of grass types and components is lacking in this study a series of artificial rainfalls 48 72 and 108 mm h 1 were conducted on eight plots each one was replicated that were established on steep spoil heaps and treated with three different grass types artemisia gmelinii ag medicago sativa ms and cynodon dactylon cd with measurements of the runoff generation sediment yield and runoff velocity bare plot bs was set up as a control three scenarios regarding erosion efficiencies that by intact grass ig a combination of grass stems and roots nl and only grass root or were considered the results showed 1 grass recovery can significantly reduce soil loss rate slr on spoil heaps up to 99 and there was no significant difference in erosion reduction efficiency between grasses with a taproot ag 93 and fibrous root ms 92 cd 89 systems under the ig treatments p 0 05 2 the effect of the different grass treatments on slr reduction depended on the rainfall intensity the contribution rate of roots to slr reduction was 68 90 at a rainfall intensity of 48 mm h 1 while the stem and leaf contribution rates were 39 156 at intensities of 72 and 108 mm h 1 respectively while incomplete grass even increased the slr especially in the or treatment where the contribution rate of root to slr reduction was 2 68 3 the ig treatment reduced soil erodibility kr by 81 43 83 80 while the kr values of the or treatment were 1 51 3 53 times greater as compared to the bs plots in most cases the critical shear stress τc on the grass plots was 1 09 2 14 times greater than those in the bs plots these results would guide the selection of grass species for controlling spoil heaps erosion also highlight the necessity of maintaining grass to maximize its control efficiency keywords spoil heaps rainfall simulation grass recovery taproot and fibrous root vegetation components shear stress 1 introduction soil erosion is one of the most serious environmental problems worldwide imposing a far reaching challenge on long term sustainable development particularly given the increasing frequency of extreme rainfall events viola et al 2016 borrelli et al 2017 pan et al 2019 martínez mena et al 2020 spoil heaps are formed by excess soil and gravel mixtures that are generated during production and construction activities russell et al 2018 guo et al 2020a spoil heap erosion which is also called geotechnical erosion is the process wherein soil and gravel mixtures are eroded transported and deposited under the force of hydraulic gravity and wind agents zhang and gao 2014 featured with low organic matter and vegetation cover the soil loss rate of spoil heaps is hundreds of times greater than those of forestlands or other vegetated hillslopes keith and jonathan 1995 liu and hu 2008 leading to both environmental and economic downfalls bridges and oldeman 1999 conforti and ietto 2020 criss et al 2020 it is therefore imperative to understand the erosion mechanism of spoil heaps and how to properly manage them the major factors that govern the soil erosion processes include rainfall slope topography length shape and slope gradient and soil properties which have been previously well documented liu et al 1994 2000 souchère et al 2003 kinnell 2005 rieke zapp and nearing 2005 compared to natural slopes and farming lands the most conspicuous features of spoil heaps are the larger bulk density and porosity combined with gravel a lack of nutrients and soil structure and steep gradients zhang and gao 2014 li et al 2020a the interactions between those features and rainfall intensity significantly complicate the erosion processes of spoil heaps for example the exposure and accumulation of gravel during rainfall events on the one hand increases surface roughness and decreases flow velocity hence potentially decreasing the soil loss rate abrahams et al 1995 peng et al 2014 niu et al 2019 while on the other hand gravel may initiate local high velocity flow around the roughness elements and promote the development of rills which potentially increase the soil loss rate wang et al 2016 in addition an increase in the slope gradient would lead to an increase in flow velocity and hence an increase in the detachment and transport of soil particles niu et al 2019 yang et al 2019 an increasing slope gradient may also lead to an increase in the water depth of ponds which tends to protect the soil from drop impact in such a way there is a negative relationship between the slope gradient and soil loss rate li et al 2010 the mutual reinforcement or mutual counteraction of those factors therefore poses challenges both for understanding the erosion mechanism of spoil heaps and how to properly manage them substantial research has been conducted to investigate soil erosion processes on spoil heaps takken et al 2001 in general the soil loss rates on spoil heaps were found to be one hundred times greater than those on undisturbed surfaces riley 1995 for example guo et al 2020a simulated artificial rainfall on four types of disturbed land with undisturbed land as control and reported that the soil loss rate of spoil heaps could range from 16 8 to 822 0 g m 2 min 1 similar soil loss rates were also reported in the studies of lv et al 2019 and ding et al 2017 on natural slopes near spoil heaps soil loss rates ranging from 1 5 to 6 0 g m 2 min 1 have been documented chow and rees 1995 in addition the soil textures of spoil heaps were also found to affect the soil loss rate and runoff rate for example li et al 2016 reported that the soil loss rate on spoil heaps with a sandy soil texture was 2 3 3 0 times that on spoil heaps with loam and clay soil textures ding et al 2017 found that the runoff rate on sandy spoil heaps was 1 89 times greater than that on purple spoil heaps furthermore variations in gravel materials content shape size position also result in variabilities of soil loss rates on spoil heaps wang et al 2016 lv et al 2019 li et al 2020b and the gravel content has been found to be the most profound effect over other factors wang et al 2012 lv et al 2019 the selection and implementation of erosion control practices are at the heart of soil erosion research fattet et al 2011 burylo et al 2012 pan et al 2019 many studies regarding erosion control practices across different climatic regions and land uses have been conducted souchère et al 2003 mchunu and chaplot 2012 where the efficiencies of engineering measures such as check dams or drainage ditches and vegetation measures are well documented and acknowledged yang et al 2019 lv et al 2020 wang et al 2021b the engineering measures applied to protect surfaces from erosion are often time sensitive easily damaged after establishment and may not be consistent with regional ecological restoration goals guo et al 2020a the selection and efficiency of vegetation measures exhibit a large degree of variability compared to engineering measures a meta analysis of global scale literature by mhazo et al 2016 showed that the efficiency of vegetation measures in reducing runoff and soil loss depends on vegetation type climate and soil characteristics given the unique soil and topographic characteristics of spoil heaps and the discrepancies among the efficiencies of vegetation measures due to vegetation climate and soil characteristics mhazo et al 2016 it is therefore critical to investigate and compare the efficiencies of different vegetation measures targeting spoil heap erosion in a specific region to guide local erosion control practices previous studies showed that grass compared to shrubs could achieve sound erosion control benefits in a short time which is explainable as follows 1 grass roots can both improve soil structure stability and promote infiltration traoré et al 2000 yang et al 2019 2 grass stems can increase both surface roughness and flow tortuosity wang et al 2021a and 3 grass surface cover can protect the soil surface from raindrop splashing de almeida et al 2018 however inconsistent results regarding the contribution of the above and underground parts of grass to erosion controlling benefits exist for example zhang et al 2014 found that the above and underground parts of grass equally contributed to soil loss reduction de bates et al 2007 and zhao et al 2017 reported that erosion was reduced more by grass root systems than by other components of grass while opposite results were reported in the studies of pan et al 2006 and li and pan 2018 these differences in the contribution rate of vegetation components may be caused by the differences in soil properties and grass root systems for example vannoppen et al 2017 pointed out that the effects of vegetation on soil erosion were highly related to soil texture and bulk density in addition grasses with fibrous root systems were found to be more effective in reducing soil loss than grasses with taproot systems de baets et al 2007 stokes et al 2009 vannoppen et al 2017 moreover existing research mainly focuses on the biomass of root and root system indicators e g root length density root surface area density and root volume density how the different root architectures affect soil loss control on disturbed land requires research especially considering the spatial distribution of the root system in the soil pollen bankhead and simon 2010 burylo et al 2012 considering the different soil textures of spoil heaps a comparison between control efficiencies of different vegetation components is not trivial but of great importance to have a better understanding of the interaction between vegetation spoil heaps and rainfall to guide the selection and implementation of vegetation measures for spoil heaps in this study a series of artificial rainfall events at intensities of 48 72 and 108 mm h 1 was conducted in eight plots each one was replicated that were established on steep spoil heaps treated with three different grass types artemisia gmelinii ag medicago sativa ms cynodon dactylon cd with measurements of runoff generation sediment yield and runoff velocity a bare plot bs was setup as a control three scenarios regarding erosion efficiencies of intact grass ig only grass stems and roots nl and only roots or were considered the questions to be answered here are as follows 1 how does the soil loss reduction efficiency differ as a function of grass type 2 do those differences result from the differences in grass components leaves stems and roots if they do what are their contribution rates to reducing soil loss and how do they affect erosion processes soil erodibility and critical shear stress the results presented here would be beneficial to make informed choices of vegetation measures for spoil heaps 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the field rainfall experiments were executed at the changwu agro ecological experimental station of the chinese academy of sciences on the loess plateau 135 14 23 97 n 107 41 20 27 e the study area has a temperate continental monsoon climate with an average annual temperature of 9 1 and rainfall amount of 560 mm fig 1 2 2 experimental materials the spoil heaps are composed of soil and gravel mixtures the gravel used in this experiment had a size ranging from 15 to 25 mm li et al 2016 and the bulk density of the gravel was 2 65 g cm 3 a gravel content of 10 mass percentage was set in this experiment based on field investigations lv et al 2019 li et al 2020a to eliminate factors other than vegetation and to ensure the consistency of the initial conditions of the underlying surface of spoil heaps the soil was transported from the existing spoil heaps of the g312 xinjiang shanghai projects to the test site sieved and then mixed with gravel fig 1 the soil was classified as a silty loam based on the usda texture classification system us department of agriculture 2010 the basic physical properties of the soil are listed in table 1 2 3 rainfall simulator a portable rainfall simulation system designed by the institute of soil and water conservation chinese academy of sciences and ministry of water resources was employed the simulator system comprised a pump inlet pipes valves steel pipes φ 32 mm pressure gauges and two raindrop generators rainfall intensity with a wide range from 30 to 350 mm h 1 could be achieved by changing the pressure of the raindrop generators fig 2 b the rainfall device was set at a height of 6 0 m to produce simulated rainfalls with similar terminal raindrop velocities and energies as compared to natural rainfall events the effective coverage area of the simulator was 5 0 m 4 0 m the rainfall uniformity was 85 more details about the rainfall instrument are available in wu et al 2014 2 4 runoff plots the experimental runoff plots were built on a slope at 30 in february 2019 which represented typical types of spoil heaps niu et al 2019 the plots had a size of 3 4 m 2 0 m 0 6 m length width depth fig 2a each plot was divided into two subplots two replicates using a steel plate with a depth of 60 cm underground and a height of 15 cm above the soil surface a collector was installed at the lower end of each plot to collect runoff and sediment a 5 cm sand layer was packed onto the bottom of each plot to allow free water drainage then the soil and gravel mixtures were filled to a depth of 45 cm in three layers at a bulk density of 1 35 g cm 3 each soil layer was lightly raked before the next layer was emplaced through packing to diminish the discontinuity between the layers finally a loose mixture layer with a bulk density of 1 30 g cm 3 was packed with a thickness of 10 cm to imitate the loose structural characteristics of spoil heaps three grass species were adopted to perform the experiments ag ms and cd fig 2c which can be divided into two types grass with taproots ag and fibrous roots ms and cd based on the root architecture vannoppen et al 2015 2017 the reasons for the selection of the vegetation types are as follows 1 according to the literature and field investigations the current studies showed that ag ms and cd are all typical vegetation types used for preventing soil and water loss from slopes which can play a good role in mitigating soil erosion after 4 6 months of growth zhao et al 2014 guo et al 2020b 2 all three types of grass species have significant economic benefits ms and cd can be utilized as forage and ag can be used as medicinal material however their efficiencies in reducing soil erosion on spoil heaps have not yet been thoroughly investigated the seeds of these three grass species were planted at a spacing of 15 cm 15 cm then they were left to grow for 6 months and the height of each grass species was approximately 20 30 cm at 70 80 coverage vegetation coverage was measured through digital image analysis using the following steps 1 a canon eos 850d digital camera was set up at a height of 3 m above the vegetation plots to obtain a top view image of the vegetation 2 the measured photo was then processed using open java based software image j2x which was developed by the national institutes of health to obtain a greyscale image and 3 vegetation pixels were extracted from the greyscale image by setting an intensity threshold wen et al 2009 no litter cover was observed in the plots containing the above mentioned grass species 2 5 experimental procedure for a given plot covered by a type of vegetation i e ag ms and cd or bare plot bs the experimental procedures included the following steps 1 before rainfall application the vegetation coverage initial soil moisture and bulk density were measured and the measurement results are summarized in table 2 an 8 m high windbreak net was applied to avoid any influence of wind outside the rainfall range fig 2a 2 rainfall intensity was adjusted to the designed value i e 48 72 and 108 mm h 1 these rainfall intensities are typical for the loess plateau chen et al 2018 prior to the actual rainfall application a pre rainfall calibration was conducted 3 rainfall with a 30 min duration was simulated in the plot during each rainfall event plastic buckets were used to collect runoff and sediment samples at 1 min intervals after the experimental supernatant in the buckets was discarded the sediment samples were transferred to an oven for drying at 105 c for 48 h to determine the soil loss from the plots 4 grass leaves were carefully removed while grass stems and roots nl were retained and then step 3 was repeated 5 grass stems were carefully cut without disturbing the soil surface or and then step 3 was repeated again to clarify here when rainfall was applied to the plot without cutting the vegetation the control efficiency of intact grass ig was estimated when only grass leaves were cut the control efficiency of the combination of a grass stem and root nl was quantified when only grass roots were retained the control efficiency of grass root was emphasized or fig 2d when all treatment simulations were completed an equivalent amount of soil to that eroded was refilled then the plot was left to settle for 3 days before the next rainfall simulation experiment zhang et al 2012 zhao et al 2017 2 6 data analysis 1 soil loss rate g m 2 min 1 the soil loss rate slr was obtained as 1 slr m s dlt where ms g is the soil loss

1 2 3 under the three different treatments j 1 2 3 on slr reduction was calculated as li and pan 2018 2 cs ij slr b slr ij slr b 100 where csij represents the contributions of the grass species ag ms and cd under the different treatments ig nl and or to the slr reduction effect slrb g m 2 min 1 is the slr in the bs plot and slrij g m 2 min 1 is the slr in the grass covered plots under the different treatments 3 contribution rates of different grass components to slr reduction the contribution rates of the different grass components to slr reduction were obtained as follows 3 e leaves

where e leaves e stems e roots and e total are the slr reductions attributed to the grass leaves stems roots and intact grass respectively and cr i i g cr i n l and cr i o r denote the effects of the three grass species i 1 2 3 under the three treatments ig nl and or in reducing the slr 4 shear stress τ pa the shear stress τ pa was calculated by nearing et al 1997 knapen et al 2007 7 τ ρ g h s where ρ is the water density kg m 3 g is the gravitational acceleration m s 2 s is the slope gradient m m 1 and h is the flow depth m the flow depth was determined as 8 h q vb where q is the average flow discharge corresponding to the eroded part of the plot m3 s 1 v is the average flow velocity corresponding to q m s 1 and b is the plot width 1 0 m the flow velocity v was calculated by multiplying the measured velocity by a correction factor of 0 75 because the runoff on spoil heaps is commonly between laminar and turbulent luk and merz 1992 τc is the critical shear stress and kr is the soil erodibility kr and τc were estimated as the slope and intercept with the x axis respectively of the linear regression line between the soil loss rate slr and shear stress τ as described by gilley et al 1993 and foltz et al 2008 all data analysis and figure plotting were performed with spss 16 0 ibm corp armonk ny usa and origin 8 5 software originlab corp northampton ma usa respectively 3 results 3 1 grass effect on soil loss reduction the mean soil loss rates slrs of the bs and grass covered plots at the different rainfall intensities and treatments ig nl and or are summarized in table 3 the first comparison was made between vegetated and bare plots the mean slrs of the vegetated plots were 0 23 25 90 0 16 35 18 and 0 52 57 98 g m 2 min 1 for the grass types ag ms and cd respectively in most cases the mean slrs of the grass covered plots were lower than those of the bs plots 10 88 34 48 g m 2 min 1 compared to bs the reduction of slrs was 91 97 84 99 and 88 89 for ag ms and cd respectively with an average reduction effect of 93 92 and 89 the slr reduction effects of ag were slightly greater than those of ms and cd implying that the grass species with taproot ag and fibrous root systems ms and cd had approximately equal effects in reducing soil loss the second comparison was made among different vegetation treatments ig nl or however the interactions between vegetation components and rainfall intensities were complex and no consistent differences were found among the comparisons between ig nl and or treatments for example the mean slrs of ig were significantly lower than those of the nl and or treatments at rainfall intensities of 72 and 108 mm h 1 p 0 05 but not at an intensity of 48 mm h 1 p 0 05 as vegetation types or rainfall intensities were switched the complexities were more apparent for example the mean slrs were greater under the or treatment than under the nl treatment in the ms and cd plots when rainfall intensities were 72 and 108 mm h 1 while in the ag plots the mean slrs of nl and or were similar for the three rainfall intensities such complications led to difficulties in drawing a universal conclusion regarding the contribution rates of different vegetation components leaves stems and roots to slr reduction for example the roots of ag ms and cd contributed 90 88 and 68 respectively to slr reduction at a rainfall intensity of 48 mm h 1 at a rainfall intensity of 72 mm h 1 the roots of ag and cd still contributed more to slr reduction than the leaves and stems however the roots of ms even had a negative effect on the mean slr by 8 when the rainfall intensity increased to 108 mm h 1 the roots of ag contributed 30 to slr reduction but the roots of ms and cd had a negative effect on the mean slr by 2 and 68 respectively the third comparison was conducted between grass with a taproot system grass ag and a fibrous root system ms and cd the roots of grass with a taproot system had efficient effects in reducing the erosion of spoil heaps under different rainfall intensities and the leaves had a greater effect on the slr reduction contribution rate of the stems at rainfall intensities of 72 and 108 mm h 1 for the fibrous root system under both rainfall intensities the stems had a greater contribution rate to slr reduction than the leaves and the roots even had a negative effect on the mean slr reduction at rainfall intensities of 72 and 108 mm h 1 the stems and leaves had positive and negative effects on the contribution rate to slr reduction based on vegetation type and rainfall intensity for example the leaves of ag and cd had a negative effect on slr reduction at a rainfall intensity of 72 mm h 1 similar to the stems of ag at rainfall intensities of 72 and 108 mm h 1 overall for grass with fibrous root systems the higher the grass integrity more components were combined to reduce soil loss the lower the mean slr however the mean slrs of the nl treatment were even slightly higher than those of the or treatment as the leaves of grass with the taproot system ag were cut off this meant that leaves of grass with taproot systems were more important than stems in reducing erosion on spoil heaps 3 2 soil loss processes and the dynamic contribution rate to soil loss 3 2 1 soil loss processes the soil loss processes on the bs and grass covered plots under the different treatments and rainfall intensities are shown in fig 3 the slr in the bs plots exhibited a similar pattern to the variation in rainfall intensity in which the volatility decreased after an initial increasing trend over time the slr values in the bs plots ranged from 4 06 to 23 90 g m 2 min 1 at 48 mm h 1 and they were 10 38 42 45 and 8 59 99 71 g m 2 min 1 at intensities of 72 and 108 mm h 1 respectively the maximum slr values occurred within 10 min after the start of runoff during which the occurrence times were 9 4 and 7 min at rainfall intensities of 48 72 and 108 mm h 1 respectively the mean slr in the bs plots during the first 10 min was 1 89 times that during the later stage 10 30 min at 48 mm h 1 and it was 1 43 and 1 36 times higher at 72 and 108 mm h 1 respectively this phenomenon indicated that severe erosion occurred within 10 min in the bs plots however the presence of grass altered the soil loss processes for example during the whole experiment the slr of the ig treatments for the three grass species remained low with values lower than 10 g m 2 min 1 at the three rainfall intensities the mean slr during the later stage 10 30 min was 1 62 2 29 1 69 2 84 and 1 07 1 28 times that during the first 10 min for ag ms and cd respectively cutting the leaves or stems also led to varied soil loss processes in contrast to the ig treatments the slr of the nl and or treatments increased over time for the three grass species at the three rainfall intensities in most cases the slr of the nl and or treatments were higher than that of the ig treatment especially at rainfall intensities of 72 and 108 mm h 1 however the slrs of the nl 0 11 34 61 g m 2 min 1 and or 0 82 38 07 g m 2 min 1 treatments for ag were approximately equal when the rainfall intensity reached 72 mm h 1 or higher however the values were much higher under the or treatments than under the nl treatments for ms and cd the slrs of the or and nl treatments ranged from 0 71 to 47 70 and 0 31 14 06 g m 2 min 1 respectively for ms and they were 2 20 91 81 and 0 29 24 50 g m 2 min 1 respectively for cd it was interesting to find that the slrs of the or treatments were higher than those in the bs plots for both grass species at 72 and 108 mm h 1 this result demonstrated that under heavy rainfall conditions grass with only roots could increase soil loss in addition the phenomenon often occurred during the later stage a similar phenomenon was encountered in the nl treatments for ag at rainfall intensities of 72 and 108 mm h 1 3 2 2 the dynamic contribution rate to soil loss reduction the dynamics of the contribution rate to the slr reduction over time of the bs and three grass covered plots under the different treatments and rainfall intensities are shown in fig 4 the ig treatments for the three grass species imposed a positive effect on slr reduction on the spoil heaps the contribution rate to slr reduction ranged from 48 27 to 98 72 91 10 98 73 and 75 80 97 66 for ag at rainfall intensities of 48 72 and 108 mm h 1 respectively and ranged from 92 16 to 99 69 76 47 99 31 and 58 18 96 18 and from 69 13 to 95 62 65 34 94 94 and 68 82 96 38 for ms and cd respectively generally the ig treatments reduced the mean slr by 91 21 90 41 and 86 08 for ag ms and cd respectively under multiple rainfall events the contribution rate to slr reduction of various the grass components namely roots stems and leaves was determined the contribution rate to slr reduction by roots strongly fluctuated over time for ms and cd but slightly decreased for ag the roots of the different grass species imposed a positive effect 0 on the contribution rate to slr reduction at a rainfall intensity of 48 mm h 1 compared with a negative effect for the slr contribution rate 0 at intensities of 72 and 108 mm h 1 the negative effects of the roots on the contribution rate to slr reductions were greater for ms and cd than for ag whereby the contribution rate of root increased slr ranged from 0 83 to 209 53 0 19 311 31 and 2 61 154 61 for ms cd and ag respectively while the contribution rate of root decreased slr ranged from 3 62 to 96 06 3 06 91 98 and 7 77 95 82 respectively above all in most cases the roots positively affected the contribution rate to slr reduction for ag however the contribution rate to slr reduction on the spoil heaps decreased due to the ms and cd roots and the mean contribution rates to slr reduction of the roots were 8 and 2 for ms at rainfall intensities of 72 and 108 mm h 1 respectively and 68 for cd at 108 mm h 1 table 3 in particular the stems exhibited higher contribution rates to slr reduction than did the leaves for ms and cd the contribution rate to slr reduction due to the stems fluctuated decreasing over time which was in contrast to that due to the roots however the contribution rate to slr reduction of the leaves changed slightly over time the mean contribution rates of the stems to slr reduction ranged from 7 to 83 and 27 115 for ms and cd respectively however the leaves contributed more effects to slr reduction for ag at rainfall intensities higher than 72 mm h 1 and the mean contribution rates of the leaves to slr reduction ranged from 43 to 66 table 3 the stems had a greater contribution rate to the slr reduction on the spoil heaps than did the leaves at 48 mm h 1 for both grass species in general the contribution rates of the roots to the slr reduction effects for ag were greater than those of the canopies while the opposite results were obtained for ms and cd 3 3 soil erodibility and critical shear stress the soil erodibility kr and critical shear stress τc values for the plots planted with the three grass species and the bs plots under the different treatments are shown in fig 5 the kr and τc values were 31 24 and 0 65 pa respectively in the bs plots the differences in kr were small among the three grass species under the ig treatments in which the values ranged from 5 06 to 5 80 and compared to the bs plots they decreased by 81 43 83 80 however the kr values of the or treatments were 1 51 3 53 times those of the bs plots for the nl treatment the kr values of the ms and cd plots were less than those of the bs plots compared with an increase of 5 03 for ag furthermore regardless of whether the grass was complete the τc values in the grass covered plots were greater than those in the bs plots except for ms under the ig treatment 0 58 pa the τc values for ag were 1 37 1 78 times those in the bs plots and they were 0 89 1 46 and 1 09 2 14 times those for ms and cd respectively these results indicated that compared to the bs plots eroding the same amount of soil required a greater runoff shear force in the grass covered plots in other words the grass reduced the erodibility and increased the τc value of the spoil heaps 4 discussion 4 1 roots stems and leaves increased soil loss on spoil heaps grass has been widely recognized and applied as an effective measure to reduce soil erosion fattet et al 2011 zhang et al 2014 vannoppen et al 2017 xiong et al 2019 in this study the mean slr reductions by the three grass species at different rainfall intensities ranged from 84 to 99 indicating that grass played a very important role in soil loss control on the spoil heaps table 3 however the presence of grass in different treatments ig nl and or and rainfall intensities could increase soil erosion on spoil heaps especially under heavy rainfall conditions interestingly the slrs for the ms and cd under the or treatments were higher than those in the bs plots at rainfall intensities of 72 and 108 mm h 1 this also occurred under ag at a rainfall intensity of 108 mm h 1 fig 3 compared to the bs plots the contribution rate to slr reduction by roots of three grass species was 0 19 311 31 during different rainfall events fig 4 this phenomenon often occurred during the later stage the mean slr during the later stage increased by 102 93 and 28 38 for cd and ms at a rainfall intensity of 108 mm h 1 and the increased value was 41 35 for ms at a rainfall intensity of 72 mm h 1 compared to the bs plots however the mean slr decreased by 17 43 for ag at a rainfall intensity of 108 mm h 1 under the same conditions although the slr of ig treatment was greater than that of the bs plots during several periods from 10 to 30 min fig 3a these results are inconsistent with previous studies in which either the aboveground or underground grass parts were shown to effectively reduce soil loss zhao et al 2014 pan et al 2019 zhao et al 2017 demonstrated that the contribution rates of plant roots and canopies to soil loss reduction were 66 and 34 respectively zhang et al 2012 revealed that roots contributed 46 70 to sediment reduction these differences could be explained by the following reasons 1 raindrops directly contacted the soil surface after the leaves and stems were cut the resulting runoff quickly scoured the surface under heavy rainfall conditions van dijk et al 2003 and kinnell 2005 found that rainfall intensity is the dominant factor impacting runoff generation and soil loss surface crusting and sealing occur at a high rainfall intensity which decreases the infiltration rate and increases the surface flow eventually leading to increased soil erosion deroo and riezebos 1992 assouline 2001 from the surface condition of the spoil heaps after a rainfall intensity of 108 mm h 1 comparing the grass covered plot with the or treatment to the bs plots there was a large number of chute drops on the surface of the spoil heaps covered by vegetation fig 6 2 the ig treatment effectively decreased the soil erodibility by 81 43 83 80 in the ag ms and cd treatments however the soil erodibility increased by 50 90 253 20 under the or treatments fig 5 these results are different from those of zhao et al 2017 and guo et al 2020b who found that kr decreased due to both intact grass and grass parts these differences are attributed to the characteristics of the spoil heaps however our results showed that all grass species exerted positive effects on τc as evidenced by the τc values in the grass covered plots that were 1 02 2 14 times those in the bs plots guo et al 2020b showed that compared to croplands different vegetation types increased τc 1 51 4 68 times yang et al 2019 investigated the effects of hedgerows on soil loss on spoil heaps with field scouring experiments and reported that the τc values in hedgerow plots ranged from 4 to 8 pa which was 1 3 1 6 times those on bare slopes in other words grasses with taproot or fibrous root systems impose a positive effect on increasing τc and reducing soil loss on spoil heaps 3 since the vegetation in this study only grew for 6 months the root system might not fully play the role of consolidating the soil gyssels and poesen 2003 this phenomenon also occurred on the loess plateau in china guo et al 2020c selected 35 shallow landslides triggered by prolonged rainfall on vegetation covered slopes in the nanxiaohegou catchment on the chinese loess plateau in july 2018 and found that 69 of these shallow landslides occurred in herbage covered areas roots played a leading role in erosion and they increased the soil moisture content in the shallow soil layer and created preferential infiltration flow paths 4 the porosity created by roots also promoted erosion han et al 2016 spoil heaps are soil rock mixtures with an extremely heterogeneous material composition and great dispersion the typical characteristics of spoil heaps include a loose structure low internal friction angle and cohesion and a lack of plant roots and organic matter liu and hu 2008 the slope gradient in this study was 30 which is much higher than that in farmlands forestlands and wastelands yang et al 2017 found that the soil erosion benefit of hedgerows decreased as the slope gradient increased the gravel embedded in the spoil heaps increased the porosity of the soil rock mixtures and damaged the soil structure and the root system accelerated this damage and caused severe erosion fig 6 the stems and leaves also had a negative effect on reducing soil loss in our study the leaves increased the slr contribution rate to slr reduction 0 in the later stage 10 30 min during rainfall events for ag and cd at a rainfall intensity of 48 mm h 1 fig 4c and k respectively the slr of the ig treatments for ag and cd was higher than that of the nl treatments which implied that the leaves increased soil loss on the spoil heaps fig 3c and k respectively the reason may be that under the condition that the leaves are cut and only the roots and stems are retained nl raindrops directly contact the surface layer of the spoil heaps due to the low rainfall intensity the raindrop splashing ability is weak and a crust is formed on the spoil heap surface layer resulting in a thin water flow layer which reduces the raindrop forces and decreases their scouring ability abrahams et al 1995 vandervaere et al 1997 raindrops accumulated on the leaves as large raindrops and landed on the slope surface which increased the impact force on the surface layer thereby increasing the erosion under ag and cd however this situation did not occur for ms which may be caused by the different leaf morphologies burylo et al 2012 goebes et al 2015 the stem also had a negative effect on reducing soil under ag at rainfall intensities of 72 and 108 mm h 1 figs 3a and 4a and b and the contribution rates were 4 and 5 table 3 the stems changed the runoff path and increased the curvature of the runoff which may reduce the flow velocity which also prevented sediment transport and deposition around the stems wang et al 2021a however during the heavy rainfall intensity the deposited sediment flows with the runoff again causing serious soil erosion yang et al 2019 this may be due to the combined action of the stem and the exposed gravel i e that vortex runoff formed which led to an increase in the erosive force of the runoff eventually leading to serious erosion wang et al 2016 the effects of grass on soil loss reduction are the combined result of the aboveground parts stems and leaves and underground parts roots the aboveground parts protect soil from raindrop impact and runoff washing the presence of aboveground parts also increases the infiltration rate and surface roughness which also reduce soil loss resulting from the complex interactions within the root soil mixtures altering the mechanical and hydrological properties of the spoil heap soil eviner and chapin 2003 głąb and kacorzyk 2011 vannoppen et al 2015 specifically grass roots modify the soil aggregate stability cohesion infiltration rate moisture and organic matter contents which consequently negatively influence soil erodibility angers and caron 1998 traoré et al 2000 4 2 effects of grasses with different root architectures on soil loss reduction on spoil heaps the study also found that compared to the bs plots the grasses with taproot systems ag and fibrous root systems ms and cd almost equally reduced soil loss and the mean reduction effects were 93 92 and 89 respectively table 3 the root characteristics were scanned by an epson v700 fig 7 based on a single root system ag contained more fibrous roots and taproots cd did not contain taproots but had a high fibrous root content and ms contained taproots but fewer fibrous roots furthermore the root bulk densities of ag ms and cd were 20 50 4 39 and 46 15 mm3 cm 3 respectively the difference in root characteristics might not be the major factor affecting the soil loss on spoil heaps because the vegetation growth cycle is short and the unique characteristics of spoil heaps have led to changes in the effect of vegetation on soil loss previous studies have shown that grasses with fibrous root systems are more effective in reducing soil loss than grasses with taproot systems de baets et al 2007 stokes et al 2009 vannoppen et al 2017 plant species with fibrous roots more notably improve soil resistance to flow erosion than those with taproots głąb and kacorzyk 2011 these differences originate from the material composition of the surface layer previous studies have been conducted on natural slopes with gentle gravel free structures but this research focused on man made spoil heaps with a distinct structure and gravel content and steep slopes vannoppen et al 2017 pointed out that the soil texture and bulk density play major roles in the vegetation effect on soil erosion processes and both factors are related to soil cohesion fibrous root systems are the most effective in non cohesive soils while taproot systems are the most effective in cohesive soils since the natural slope is dominated by soil particles there is no or only a small amount of gravel but the bulk density of the spoil heaps is a soil rock mixed medium in our study the bulk density of the bs plots 1 33 g cm 3 was higher than that of the grass covered plots 1 19 1 25 g cm 3 while the initial moisture content of the grass covered plots 25 67 26 92 was higher than that of the bs plots 19 92 in contrast to the literature others found that the bulk density of natural slopes is 1 17 1 31 g cm 3 chen et al 2018 and 1 0 g cm 3 li and pan 2018 the spoil heaps contain gravel which causes the bulk density to be greater than that of a natural slope however compared with the bs plots after vegetation was planted the bulk density decreased which was most intuitively reflected in the change in the infiltration rate we measured the infiltration rate of the bs and grassed spoil heaps the results showed that the average infiltration rate of the bs was 3 81 mm s 1 for 20 cm of the spoil heap surface corresponding to ag ms and cd the average infiltration rates were 19 19 10 00 and 21 31 mm s 1 respectively this may explain why the vegetation with the taproot system had an equal effect on soil loss as the fibrous root system after vegetation was planted the infiltration rate of the surface layer of the spoil heaps increased significantly while runoff decreased this article focuses on the analysis of the changes in the erosion of spoil heaps by planting vegetation with the same gravel content 10 the gravel content is a fixed factor the difference in gravel characteristics content type distribution and the erosion difference between the spoil heaps and the natural slope are not the research content of this article but we have carried out a large number of simulation studies on the erosion difference of spoil heaps based on the gravel content and soil texture li et al 2016 2020a lv et al 2019 niu et al 2019 furthermore the grass root system and canopy have a distinct importance in the different erosion forms grass roots are more effective in controlling rill and gully erosion while canopies are more efficient in preventing interrill and splash detachment gyssels and poesen 2003 zuazo and pleguezuelo 2008 no obvious rills were observed for ag ms and cd under the different treatments in other words interrill erosion dominated the grass covered plots therefore the differences in soil loss reduction among ag ms and cd were likely caused by the different canopy covers of ag 80 ms 76 and cd 72 rather than by any differences among their root systems 4 3 effects of grasses on reducing soil loss depended on rainfall intensity the grass components contributed to the differently slr reduction effect depending on the rainfall intensity the grass root system played a major role in slr reduction and contributed 68 90 at a rainfall intensity of 48 mm h 1 however at intensities of 72 and 108 mm h 1 the canopies combined stems and leaves exhibited a higher contribution rate of 39 156 table 3 multiple rainfall intensity events showed that the contribution rates to slr reduction of the ag roots and canopies were 63 and 37 respectively while they were 28 and 72 and 15 and 85 for ms and cd respectively fig 8 these results indicate that based on the average of multiple rainfall events the grass with taproot systems reduced soil erosion via the effect of the roots whereas for the grass with fibrous root systems the canopy was more important for a single rainfall event the benefits of the aboveground parts regarding slr reduction were greater than those of the roots under heavy rainfall conditions while under light rainfall conditions slr reduction was affected more by the roots these results are inconsistent with those of gyssels et al 2005 and zuazo and pleguezuelo 2008 due to the different soil erosion types in our research rill and gully erosion did not occur and both the rainfall intensity and material composition of the surface layer affected the soil loss characteristics the slr volatility decreased after an initial increasing trend over time at the different rainfall intensities in the bs plots while it remained stable fig 3 and then continued to increase for the three grass species subjected to the three different treatments the grass species not only decreased soil loss on the spoil heaps but also delayed the severe erosion stage moreover during the later stage of the above rainfall events the slr of the ig treatments greatly fluctuated namely a trend of peaks and valleys fig 3c and k was observed in the later stage leading to an increase in the instantaneous slr which also occurred in a previous study of spoil heaps in the three gorges reservoir area peng et al 2014 zhang et al 2014 the instantaneous slr values in bs plots were ranged from 4 06 to 99 71 g m 2 min 1 while they were 0 11 38 07 g m 2 min 1 0 06 47 70 g m 2 min 1 and 0 29 91 81 g m 2 min 1 for ag ms and cd respectively under different treatments and rainfall intensities the results are consistent with those reported by chow and rees 1995 i e 1 5 6 0 g m 2 min 1 li and pan 2018 i e 49 0 g m 2 min 1 lv et al 2019 i e 48 0 84 0 g m 2 min 1 li et al 2020a i e 0 8 72 4 g m 2 min 1 but were lower than those reported by guo et al 2020a for slr i e 0 1 822 0 g m 2 min 1 and ding et al 2017 i e 250 0 g m 2 min 1 the difference may be caused by the experimental method and object the mean slr during the first 10 min after runoff generation in the bs plots was 1 36 1 89 times that during the later stage however these values accounted for 65 14 75 05 48 84 65 95 and 60 10 92 42 of the mean slr for ag ms and cd respectively our results are inconsistent with those of zhao et al 2017 who found that the erosion rate on bare slopes continued to increase over time while grass covered slopes showed a decreasing trend after an initial increasing trend li and pan 2018 reported that the erosion rate in bare slopes and slopes planted with three grass species under three different treatments revealed a decreasing trend after an initial increasing trend over time the difference may be caused by the different grass species and spoil heap characteristics 5 conclusions this study aimed to investigate the effects of different grass species under various treatments ig nl and or on the soil loss processes contribution rate to slr reduction and soil resistance of steep spoil heaps compared to the bs plots the slrs on the grass covered plots ig treatments were reduced by 84 99 and the grasses under the different treatments also delayed the severe erosion stage on the spoil heaps however the different treatments imposed a positive or negative effect on soil loss reduction which depended on the rainfall intensity and vegetation type cutting the leaves or stems led to varied soil loss effects and the higher the grass integrity the lower the erosion for grass with a fibrous root system the roots reduced soil loss by 68 90 at 48 mm h 1 while the canopies stems or leaves reduced soil loss by 39 156 at 72 and 108 mm h 1 the or treatments even increased soil loss and the contribution rate values to slr reduction ranged from 2 to 68 the grass species with a taproot system ag exerted an approximate effect on soil loss reduction to that exerted by those with fibrous root systems ms and cd the ig treatment reduced the soil erodibility kr by 81 43 83 80 while the kr value of the or treatments was 1 51 3 53 times that of the bs plots the grasses increased the critical shear stress τc on the spoil heaps 1 09 2 14 times higher than that in the bs plots our study results indicate that it is necessary to maintain grass integrity to minimize soil loss due to the lack of aboveground parts which increases soil loss the results can guide vegetation type selection for soil erosion control on spoil heaps 6 limitations and prospect of this study this research forces on the influence of two typical root structure vegetation types taproot system and fibrous root system on the soil loss rate and runoff shear force parameters of spoil heaps a heterogeneous medium formed in a short period of time with a mixture of soil and rock with a steep slope through field simulation rainfall tests this research clarified the contribution rate of roots stems and leaves of vegetation with taproot and fibrous root systems to reduce the soil loss rate of the spoil heaps additionally for soil rock mixed spoil heaps it is necessary to pay attention to the maintenance of vegetation and give full play to the aboveground parts including leaves and stems however the current analysis in this paper focuses on the soil loss rate and runoff shear stress and lacks the characteristics of vegetation root characteristics biomass the separation characteristics of sediment under the action of vegetation and the physical and chemical effects of vegetation on spoil heaps of soil and rock mixed media specific analysis of characteristics and other hydraulic parameters and hydrodynamic parameters is a shortcoming of this article and the focus of subsequent in depth research studying vegetation protection on spoil heaps not only improves the ecological environment and reduces soil erosion but also analyses from the perspective of sustainable development that spoil heaps are useful resources the effective ecological restoration of abandoned land resources can increase arable land and woodland resources more importantly it can also provide quantitative scientific guidance for the selection of grass species for rapid restoration of vegetation in a project construction area credit authorship contribution statement jianming li conceptualization data curation formal analysis investigation

4048,soil erosion on spoil heaps is one of the global environmental issues where grass recovery is often implemented however information regarding how the erosion processes and control efficiency on spoil heaps differ as functions of grass types and components is lacking in this study a series of artificial rainfalls 48 72 and 108 mm h 1 were conducted on eight plots each one was replicated that were established on steep spoil heaps and treated with three different grass types artemisia gmelinii ag medicago sativa ms and cynodon dactylon cd with measurements of the runoff generation sediment yield and runoff velocity bare plot bs was set up as a control three scenarios regarding erosion efficiencies that by intact grass ig a combination of grass stems and roots nl and only grass root or were considered the results showed 1 grass recovery can significantly reduce soil loss rate slr on spoil heaps up to 99 and there was no significant difference in erosion reduction efficiency between grasses with a taproot ag 93 and fibrous root ms 92 cd 89 systems under the ig treatments p 0 05 2 the effect of the different grass treatments on slr reduction depended on the rainfall intensity the contribution rate of roots to slr reduction was 68 90 at a rainfall intensity of 48 mm h 1 while the stem and leaf contribution rates were 39 156 at intensities of 72 and 108 mm h 1 respectively while incomplete grass even increased the slr especially in the or treatment where the contribution rate of root to slr reduction was 2 68 3 the ig treatment reduced soil erodibility kr by 81 43 83 80 while the kr values of the or treatment were 1 51 3 53 times greater as compared to the bs plots in most cases the critical shear stress τc on the grass plots was 1 09 2 14 times greater than those in the bs plots these results would guide the selection of grass species for controlling spoil heaps erosion also highlight the necessity of maintaining grass to maximize its control efficiency keywords spoil heaps rainfall simulation grass recovery taproot and fibrous root vegetation components shear stress 1 introduction soil erosion is one of the most serious environmental problems worldwide imposing a far reaching challenge on long term sustainable development particularly given the increasing frequency of extreme rainfall events viola et al 2016 borrelli et al 2017 pan et al 2019 martínez mena et al 2020 spoil heaps are formed by excess soil and gravel mixtures that are generated during production and construction activities russell et al 2018 guo et al 2020a spoil heap erosion which is also called geotechnical erosion is the process wherein soil and gravel mixtures are eroded transported and deposited under the force of hydraulic gravity and wind agents zhang and gao 2014 featured with low organic matter and vegetation cover the soil loss rate of spoil heaps is hundreds of times greater than those of forestlands or other vegetated hillslopes keith and jonathan 1995 liu and hu 2008 leading to both environmental and economic downfalls bridges and oldeman 1999 conforti and ietto 2020 criss et al 2020 it is therefore imperative to understand the erosion mechanism of spoil heaps and how to properly manage them the major factors that govern the soil erosion processes include rainfall slope topography length shape and slope gradient and soil properties which have been previously well documented liu et al 1994 2000 souchère et al 2003 kinnell 2005 rieke zapp and nearing 2005 compared to natural slopes and farming lands the most conspicuous features of spoil heaps are the larger bulk density and porosity combined with gravel a lack of nutrients and soil structure and steep gradients zhang and gao 2014 li et al 2020a the interactions between those features and rainfall intensity significantly complicate the erosion processes of spoil heaps for example the exposure and accumulation of gravel during rainfall events on the one hand increases surface roughness and decreases flow velocity hence potentially decreasing the soil loss rate abrahams et al 1995 peng et al 2014 niu et al 2019 while on the other hand gravel may initiate local high velocity flow around the roughness elements and promote the development of rills which potentially increase the soil loss rate wang et al 2016 in addition an increase in the slope gradient would lead to an increase in flow velocity and hence an increase in the detachment and transport of soil particles niu et al 2019 yang et al 2019 an increasing slope gradient may also lead to an increase in the water depth of ponds which tends to protect the soil from drop impact in such a way there is a negative relationship between the slope gradient and soil loss rate li et al 2010 the mutual reinforcement or mutual counteraction of those factors therefore poses challenges both for understanding the erosion mechanism of spoil heaps and how to properly manage them substantial research has been conducted to investigate soil erosion processes on spoil heaps takken et al 2001 in general the soil loss rates on spoil heaps were found to be one hundred times greater than those on undisturbed surfaces riley 1995 for example guo et al 2020a simulated artificial rainfall on four types of disturbed land with undisturbed land as control and reported that the soil loss rate of spoil heaps could range from 16 8 to 822 0 g m 2 min 1 similar soil loss rates were also reported in the studies of lv et al 2019 and ding et al 2017 on natural slopes near spoil heaps soil loss rates ranging from 1 5 to 6 0 g m 2 min 1 have been documented chow and rees 1995 in addition the soil textures of spoil heaps were also found to affect the soil loss rate and runoff rate for example li et al 2016 reported that the soil loss rate on spoil heaps with a sandy soil texture was 2 3 3 0 times that on spoil heaps with loam and clay soil textures ding et al 2017 found that the runoff rate on sandy spoil heaps was 1 89 times greater than that on purple spoil heaps furthermore variations in gravel materials content shape size position also result in variabilities of soil loss rates on spoil heaps wang et al 2016 lv et al 2019 li et al 2020b and the gravel content has been found to be the most profound effect over other factors wang et al 2012 lv et al 2019 the selection and implementation of erosion control practices are at the heart of soil erosion research fattet et al 2011 burylo et al 2012 pan et al 2019 many studies regarding erosion control practices across different climatic regions and land uses have been conducted souchère et al 2003 mchunu and chaplot 2012 where the efficiencies of engineering measures such as check dams or drainage ditches and vegetation measures are well documented and acknowledged yang et al 2019 lv et al 2020 wang et al 2021b the engineering measures applied to protect surfaces from erosion are often time sensitive easily damaged after establishment and may not be consistent with regional ecological restoration goals guo et al 2020a the selection and efficiency of vegetation measures exhibit a large degree of variability compared to engineering measures a meta analysis of global scale literature by mhazo et al 2016 showed that the efficiency of vegetation measures in reducing runoff and soil loss depends on vegetation type climate and soil characteristics given the unique soil and topographic characteristics of spoil heaps and the discrepancies among the efficiencies of vegetation measures due to vegetation climate and soil characteristics mhazo et al 2016 it is therefore critical to investigate and compare the efficiencies of different vegetation measures targeting spoil heap erosion in a specific region to guide local erosion control practices previous studies showed that grass compared to shrubs could achieve sound erosion control benefits in a short time which is explainable as follows 1 grass roots can both improve soil structure stability and promote infiltration traoré et al 2000 yang et al 2019 2 grass stems can increase both surface roughness and flow tortuosity wang et al 2021a and 3 grass surface cover can protect the soil surface from raindrop splashing de almeida et al 2018 however inconsistent results regarding the contribution of the above and underground parts of grass to erosion controlling benefits exist for example zhang et al 2014 found that the above and underground parts of grass equally contributed to soil loss reduction de bates et al 2007 and zhao et al 2017 reported that erosion was reduced more by grass root systems than by other components of grass while opposite results were reported in the studies of pan et al 2006 and li and pan 2018 these differences in the contribution rate of vegetation components may be caused by the differences in soil properties and grass root systems for example vannoppen et al 2017 pointed out that the effects of vegetation on soil erosion were highly related to soil texture and bulk density in addition grasses with fibrous root systems were found to be more effective in reducing soil loss than grasses with taproot systems de baets et al 2007 stokes et al 2009 vannoppen et al 2017 moreover existing research mainly focuses on the biomass of root and root system indicators e g root length density root surface area density and root volume density how the different root architectures affect soil loss control on disturbed land requires research especially considering the spatial distribution of the root system in the soil pollen bankhead and simon 2010 burylo et al 2012 considering the different soil textures of spoil heaps a comparison between control efficiencies of different vegetation components is not trivial but of great importance to have a better understanding of the interaction between vegetation spoil heaps and rainfall to guide the selection and implementation of vegetation measures for spoil heaps in this study a series of artificial rainfall events at intensities of 48 72 and 108 mm h 1 was conducted in eight plots each one was replicated that were established on steep spoil heaps treated with three different grass types artemisia gmelinii ag medicago sativa ms cynodon dactylon cd with measurements of runoff generation sediment yield and runoff velocity a bare plot bs was setup as a control three scenarios regarding erosion efficiencies of intact grass ig only grass stems and roots nl and only roots or were considered the questions to be answered here are as follows 1 how does the soil loss reduction efficiency differ as a function of grass type 2 do those differences result from the differences in grass components leaves stems and roots if they do what are their contribution rates to reducing soil loss and how do they affect erosion processes soil erodibility and critical shear stress the results presented here would be beneficial to make informed choices of vegetation measures for spoil heaps 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the field rainfall experiments were executed at the changwu agro ecological experimental station of the chinese academy of sciences on the loess plateau 135 14 23 97 n 107 41 20 27 e the study area has a temperate continental monsoon climate with an average annual temperature of 9 1 and rainfall amount of 560 mm fig 1 2 2 experimental materials the spoil heaps are composed of soil and gravel mixtures the gravel used in this experiment had a size ranging from 15 to 25 mm li et al 2016 and the bulk density of the gravel was 2 65 g cm 3 a gravel content of 10 mass percentage was set in this experiment based on field investigations lv et al 2019 li et al 2020a to eliminate factors other than vegetation and to ensure the consistency of the initial conditions of the underlying surface of spoil heaps the soil was transported from the existing spoil heaps of the g312 xinjiang shanghai projects to the test site sieved and then mixed with gravel fig 1 the soil was classified as a silty loam based on the usda texture classification system us department of agriculture 2010 the basic physical properties of the soil are listed in table 1 2 3 rainfall simulator a portable rainfall simulation system designed by the institute of soil and water conservation chinese academy of sciences and ministry of water resources was employed the simulator system comprised a pump inlet pipes valves steel pipes φ 32 mm pressure gauges and two raindrop generators rainfall intensity with a wide range from 30 to 350 mm h 1 could be achieved by changing the pressure of the raindrop generators fig 2 b the rainfall device was set at a height of 6 0 m to produce simulated rainfalls with similar terminal raindrop velocities and energies as compared to natural rainfall events the effective coverage area of the simulator was 5 0 m 4 0 m the rainfall uniformity was 85 more details about the rainfall instrument are available in wu et al 2014 2 4 runoff plots the experimental runoff plots were built on a slope at 30 in february 2019 which represented typical types of spoil heaps niu et al 2019 the plots had a size of 3 4 m 2 0 m 0 6 m length width depth fig 2a each plot was divided into two subplots two replicates using a steel plate with a depth of 60 cm underground and a height of 15 cm above the soil surface a collector was installed at the lower end of each plot to collect runoff and sediment a 5 cm sand layer was packed onto the bottom of each plot to allow free water drainage then the soil and gravel mixtures were filled to a depth of 45 cm in three layers at a bulk density of 1 35 g cm 3 each soil layer was lightly raked before the next layer was emplaced through packing to diminish the discontinuity between the layers finally a loose mixture layer with a bulk density of 1 30 g cm 3 was packed with a thickness of 10 cm to imitate the loose structural characteristics of spoil heaps three grass species were adopted to perform the experiments ag ms and cd fig 2c which can be divided into two types grass with taproots ag and fibrous roots ms and cd based on the root architecture vannoppen et al 2015 2017 the reasons for the selection of the vegetation types are as follows 1 according to the literature and field investigations the current studies showed that ag ms and cd are all typical vegetation types used for preventing soil and water loss from slopes which can play a good role in mitigating soil erosion after 4 6 months of growth zhao et al 2014 guo et al 2020b 2 all three types of grass species have significant economic benefits ms and cd can be utilized as forage and ag can be used as medicinal material however their efficiencies in reducing soil erosion on spoil heaps have not yet been thoroughly investigated the seeds of these three grass species were planted at a spacing of 15 cm 15 cm then they were left to grow for 6 months and the height of each grass species was approximately 20 30 cm at 70 80 coverage vegetation coverage was measured through digital image analysis using the following steps 1 a canon eos 850d digital camera was set up at a height of 3 m above the vegetation plots to obtain a top view image of the vegetation 2 the measured photo was then processed using open java based software image j2x which was developed by the national institutes of health to obtain a greyscale image and 3 vegetation pixels were extracted from the greyscale image by setting an intensity threshold wen et al 2009 no litter cover was observed in the plots containing the above mentioned grass species 2 5 experimental procedure for a given plot covered by a type of vegetation i e ag ms and cd or bare plot bs the experimental procedures included the following steps 1 before rainfall application the vegetation coverage initial soil moisture and bulk density were measured and the measurement results are summarized in table 2 an 8 m high windbreak net was applied to avoid any influence of wind outside the rainfall range fig 2a 2 rainfall intensity was adjusted to the designed value i e 48 72 and 108 mm h 1 these rainfall intensities are typical for the loess plateau chen et al 2018 prior to the actual rainfall application a pre rainfall calibration was conducted 3 rainfall with a 30 min duration was simulated in the plot during each rainfall event plastic buckets were used to collect runoff and sediment samples at 1 min intervals after the experimental supernatant in the buckets was discarded the sediment samples were transferred to an oven for drying at 105 c for 48 h to determine the soil loss from the plots 4 grass leaves were carefully removed while grass stems and roots nl were retained and then step 3 was repeated 5 grass stems were carefully cut without disturbing the soil surface or and then step 3 was repeated again to clarify here when rainfall was applied to the plot without cutting the vegetation the control efficiency of intact grass ig was estimated when only grass leaves were cut the control efficiency of the combination of a grass stem and root nl was quantified when only grass roots were retained the control efficiency of grass root was emphasized or fig 2d when all treatment simulations were completed an equivalent amount of soil to that eroded was refilled then the plot was left to settle for 3 days before the next rainfall simulation experiment zhang et al 2012 zhao et al 2017 2 6 data analysis 1 soil loss rate g m 2 min 1 the soil loss rate slr was obtained as 1 slr m s dlt where ms g is the soil loss

and cd under the different treatments ig nl and or to the slr reduction effect slrb g m 2 min 1 is the slr in the bs plot and slrij g m 2 min 1 is the slr in the grass covered plots under the different treatments 3 contribution rates of different grass components to slr reduction the contribution rates of the different grass components to slr reduction were obtained as follows 3 e leaves

three grass species i 1 2 3 under the three treatments ig nl and or in reducing the slr 4 shear stress τ pa the shear stress τ pa was calculated by nearing et al 1997 knapen et al 2007 7 τ ρ g h s where ρ is the water density kg m 3 g is the gravitational acceleration m s 2 s is the slope gradient m m 1 and h is the flow depth m the flow depth was determined as 8 h q vb where q is the average flow discharge corresponding to the eroded part of the plot m3 s 1 v is the average flow velocity corresponding to q m s 1 and b is the plot width 1 0 m the flow velocity v was calculated by multiplying the measured velocity by a correction factor of 0 75 because the runoff on spoil heaps is commonly between laminar and turbulent luk and merz 1992 τc is the critical shear stress and kr is the soil erodibility kr and τc were estimated as the slope and intercept with the x axis respectively of the linear regression line between the soil loss rate slr and shear stress τ as described by gilley et al 1993 and foltz et al 2008 all data analysis and figure plotting were performed with spss 16 0 ibm corp armonk ny usa and origin 8 5 software originlab corp northampton ma usa respectively 3 results 3 1 grass effect on soil loss reduction the mean soil loss rates slrs of the bs and grass covered plots at the different rainfall intensities and treatments ig nl and or are summarized in table 3 the first comparison was made between vegetated and bare plots the mean slrs of the vegetated plots were 0 23 25 90 0 16 35 18 and 0 52 57 98 g m 2 min 1 for the grass types ag ms and cd respectively in most cases the mean slrs of the grass covered plots were lower than those of the bs plots 10 88 34 48 g m 2 min 1 compared to bs the reduction of slrs was 91 97 84 99 and 88 89 for ag ms and cd respectively with an average reduction effect of 93 92 and 89 the slr reduction effects of ag were slightly greater than those of ms and cd implying that the grass species with taproot ag and fibrous root systems ms and cd had approximately equal effects in reducing soil loss the second comparison was made among different vegetation treatments ig nl or however the interactions between vegetation components and rainfall intensities were complex and no consistent differences were found among the comparisons between ig nl and or treatments for example the mean slrs of ig were significantly lower than those of the nl and or treatments at rainfall intensities of 72 and 108 mm h 1 p 0 05 but not at an intensity of 48 mm h 1 p 0 05 as vegetation types or rainfall intensities were switched the complexities were more apparent for example the mean slrs were greater under the or treatment than under the nl treatment in the ms and cd plots when rainfall intensities were 72 and 108 mm h 1 while in the ag plots the mean slrs of nl and or were similar for the three rainfall intensities such complications led to difficulties in drawing a universal conclusion regarding the contribution rates of different vegetation components leaves stems and roots to slr reduction for example the roots of ag ms and cd contributed 90 88 and 68 respectively to slr reduction at a rainfall intensity of 48 mm h 1 at a rainfall intensity of 72 mm h 1 the roots of ag and cd still contributed more to slr reduction than the leaves and stems however the roots of ms even had a negative effect on the mean slr by 8 when the rainfall intensity increased to 108 mm h 1 the roots of ag contributed 30 to slr reduction but the roots of ms and cd had a negative effect on the mean slr by 2 and 68 respectively the third comparison was conducted between grass with a taproot system grass ag and a fibrous root system ms and cd the roots of grass with a taproot system had efficient effects in reducing the erosion of spoil heaps under different rainfall intensities and the leaves had a greater effect on the slr reduction contribution rate of the stems at rainfall intensities of 72 and 108 mm h 1 for the fibrous root system under both rainfall intensities the stems had a greater contribution rate to slr reduction than the leaves and the roots even had a negative effect on the mean slr reduction at rainfall intensities of 72 and 108 mm h 1 the stems and leaves had positive and negative effects on the contribution rate to slr reduction based on vegetation type and rainfall intensity for example the leaves of ag and cd had a negative effect on slr reduction at a rainfall intensity of 72 mm h 1 similar to the stems of ag at rainfall intensities of 72 and 108 mm h 1 overall for grass with fibrous root systems the higher the grass integrity more components were combined to reduce soil loss the lower the mean slr however the mean slrs of the nl treatment were even slightly higher than those of the or treatment as the leaves of grass with the taproot system ag were cut off this meant that leaves of grass with taproot systems were more important than stems in reducing erosion on spoil heaps 3 2 soil loss processes and the dynamic contribution rate to soil loss 3 2 1 soil loss processes the soil loss processes on the bs and grass covered plots under the different treatments and rainfall intensities are shown in fig 3 the slr in the bs plots exhibited a similar pattern to the variation in rainfall intensity in which the volatility decreased after an initial increasing trend over time the slr values in the bs plots ranged from 4 06 to 23 90 g m 2 min 1 at 48 mm h 1 and they were 10 38 42 45 and 8 59 99 71 g m 2 min 1 at intensities of 72 and 108 mm h 1 respectively the maximum slr values occurred within 10 min after the start of runoff during which the occurrence times were 9 4 and 7 min at rainfall intensities of 48 72 and 108 mm h 1 respectively the mean slr in the bs plots during the first 10 min was 1 89 times that during the later stage 10 30 min at 48 mm h 1 and it was 1 43 and 1 36 times higher at 72 and 108 mm h 1 respectively this phenomenon indicated that severe erosion occurred within 10 min in the bs plots however the presence of grass altered the soil loss processes for example during the whole experiment the slr of the ig treatments for the three grass species remained low with values lower than 10 g m 2 min 1 at the three rainfall intensities the mean slr during the later stage 10 30 min was 1 62 2 29 1 69 2 84 and 1 07 1 28 times that during the first 10 min for ag ms and cd respectively cutting the leaves or stems also led to varied soil loss processes in contrast to the ig treatments the slr of the nl and or treatments increased over time for the three grass species at the three rainfall intensities in most cases the slr of the nl and or treatments were higher than that of the ig treatment especially at rainfall intensities of 72 and 108 mm h 1 however the slrs of the nl 0 11 34 61 g m 2 min 1 and or 0 82 38 07 g m 2 min 1 treatments for ag were approximately equal when the rainfall intensity reached 72 mm h 1 or higher however the values were much higher under the or treatments than under the nl treatments for ms and cd the slrs of the or and nl treatments ranged from 0 71 to 47 70 and 0 31 14 06 g m 2 min 1 respectively for ms and they were 2 20 91 81 and 0 29 24 50 g m 2 min 1 respectively for cd it was interesting to find that the slrs of the or treatments were higher than those in the bs plots for both grass species at 72 and 108 mm h 1 this result demonstrated that under heavy rainfall conditions grass with only roots could increase soil loss in addition the phenomenon often occurred during the later stage a similar phenomenon was encountered in the nl treatments for ag at rainfall intensities of 72 and 108 mm h 1 3 2 2 the dynamic contribution rate to soil loss reduction the dynamics of the contribution rate to the slr reduction over time of the bs and three grass covered plots under the different treatments and rainfall intensities are shown in fig 4 the ig treatments for the three grass species imposed a positive effect on slr reduction on the spoil heaps the contribution rate to slr reduction ranged from 48 27 to 98 72 91 10 98 73 and 75 80 97 66 for ag at rainfall intensities of 48 72 and 108 mm h 1 respectively and ranged from 92 16 to 99 69 76 47 99 31 and 58 18 96 18 and from 69 13 to 95 62 65 34 94 94 and 68 82 96 38 for ms and cd respectively generally the ig treatments reduced the mean slr by 91 21 90 41 and 86 08 for ag ms and cd respectively under multiple rainfall events the contribution rate to slr reduction of various the grass components namely roots stems and leaves was determined the contribution rate to slr reduction by roots strongly fluctuated over time for ms and cd but slightly decreased for ag the roots of the different grass species imposed a positive effect 0 on the contribution rate to slr reduction at a rainfall intensity of 48 mm h 1 compared with a negative effect for the slr contribution rate 0 at intensities of 72 and 108 mm h 1 the negative effects of the roots on the contribution rate to slr reductions were greater for ms and cd than for ag whereby the contribution rate of root increased slr ranged from 0 83 to 209 53 0 19 311 31 and 2 61 154 61 for ms cd and ag respectively while the contribution rate of root decreased slr ranged from 3 62 to 96 06 3 06 91 98 and 7 77 95 82 respectively above all in most cases the roots positively affected the contribution rate to slr reduction for ag however the contribution rate to slr reduction on the spoil heaps decreased due to the ms and cd roots and the mean contribution rates to slr reduction of the roots were 8 and 2 for ms at rainfall intensities of 72 and 108 mm h 1 respectively and 68 for cd at 108 mm h 1 table 3 in particular the stems exhibited higher contribution rates to slr reduction than did the leaves for ms and cd the contribution rate to slr reduction due to the stems fluctuated decreasing over time which was in contrast to that due to the roots however the contribution rate to slr reduction of the leaves changed slightly over time the mean contribution rates of the stems to slr reduction ranged from 7 to 83 and 27 115 for ms and cd respectively however the leaves contributed more effects to slr reduction for ag at rainfall intensities higher than 72 mm h 1 and the mean contribution rates of the leaves to slr reduction ranged from 43 to 66 table 3 the stems had a greater contribution rate to the slr reduction on the spoil heaps than did the leaves at 48 mm h 1 for both grass species in general the contribution rates of the roots to the slr reduction effects for ag were greater than those of the canopies while the opposite results were obtained for ms and cd 3 3 soil erodibility and critical shear stress the soil erodibility kr and critical shear stress τc values for the plots planted with the three grass species and the bs plots under the different treatments are shown in fig 5 the kr and τc values were 31 24 and 0 65 pa respectively in the bs plots the differences in kr were small among the three grass species under the ig treatments in which the values ranged from 5 06 to 5 80 and compared to the bs plots they decreased by 81 43 83 80 however the kr values of the or treatments were 1 51 3 53 times those of the bs plots for the nl treatment the kr values of the ms and cd plots were less than those of the bs plots compared with an increase of 5 03 for ag furthermore regardless of whether the grass was complete the τc values in the grass covered plots were greater than those in the bs plots except for ms under the ig treatment 0 58 pa the τc values for ag were 1 37 1 78 times those in the bs plots and they were 0 89 1 46 and 1 09 2 14 times those for ms and cd respectively these results indicated that compared to the bs plots eroding the same amount of soil required a greater runoff shear force in the grass covered plots in other words the grass reduced the erodibility and increased the τc value of the spoil heaps 4 discussion 4 1 roots stems and leaves increased soil loss on spoil heaps grass has been widely recognized and applied as an effective measure to reduce soil erosion fattet et al 2011 zhang et al 2014 vannoppen et al 2017 xiong et al 2019 in this study the mean slr reductions by the three grass species at different rainfall intensities ranged from 84 to 99 indicating that grass played a very important role in soil loss control on the spoil heaps table 3 however the presence of grass in different treatments ig nl and or and rainfall intensities could increase soil erosion on spoil heaps especially under heavy rainfall conditions interestingly the slrs for the ms and cd under the or treatments were higher than those in the bs plots at rainfall intensities of 72 and 108 mm h 1 this also occurred under ag at a rainfall intensity of 108 mm h 1 fig 3 compared to the bs plots the contribution rate to slr reduction by roots of three grass species was 0 19 311 31 during different rainfall events fig 4 this phenomenon often occurred during the later stage the mean slr during the later stage increased by 102 93 and 28 38 for cd and ms at a rainfall intensity of 108 mm h 1 and the increased value was 41 35 for ms at a rainfall intensity of 72 mm h 1 compared to the bs plots however the mean slr decreased by 17 43 for ag at a rainfall intensity of 108 mm h 1 under the same conditions although the slr of ig treatment was greater than that of the bs plots during several periods from 10 to 30 min fig 3a these results are inconsistent with previous studies in which either the aboveground or underground grass parts were shown to effectively reduce soil loss zhao et al 2014 pan et al 2019 zhao et al 2017 demonstrated that the contribution rates of plant roots and canopies to soil loss reduction were 66 and 34 respectively zhang et al 2012 revealed that roots contributed 46 70 to sediment reduction these differences could be explained by the following reasons 1 raindrops directly contacted the soil surface after the leaves and stems were cut the resulting runoff quickly scoured the surface under heavy rainfall conditions van dijk et al 2003 and kinnell 2005 found that rainfall intensity is the dominant factor impacting runoff generation and soil loss surface crusting and sealing occur at a high rainfall intensity which decreases the infiltration rate and increases the surface flow eventually leading to increased soil erosion deroo and riezebos 1992 assouline 2001 from the surface condition of the spoil heaps after a rainfall intensity of 108 mm h 1 comparing the grass covered plot with the or treatment to the bs plots there was a large number of chute drops on the surface of the spoil heaps covered by vegetation fig 6 2 the ig treatment effectively decreased the soil erodibility by 81 43 83 80 in the ag ms and cd treatments however the soil erodibility increased by 50 90 253 20 under the or treatments fig 5 these results are different from those of zhao et al 2017 and guo et al 2020b who found that kr decreased due to both intact grass and grass parts these differences are attributed to the characteristics of the spoil heaps however our results showed that all grass species exerted positive effects on τc as evidenced by the τc values in the grass covered plots that were 1 02 2 14 times those in the bs plots guo et al 2020b showed that compared to croplands different vegetation types increased τc 1 51 4 68 times yang et al 2019 investigated the effects of hedgerows on soil loss on spoil heaps with field scouring experiments and reported that the τc values in hedgerow plots ranged from 4 to 8 pa which was 1 3 1 6 times those on bare slopes in other words grasses with taproot or fibrous root systems impose a positive effect on increasing τc and reducing soil loss on spoil heaps 3 since the vegetation in this study only grew for 6 months the root system might not fully play the role of consolidating the soil gyssels and poesen 2003 this phenomenon also occurred on the loess plateau in china guo et al 2020c selected 35 shallow landslides triggered by prolonged rainfall on vegetation covered slopes in the nanxiaohegou catchment on the chinese loess plateau in july 2018 and found that 69 of these shallow landslides occurred in herbage covered areas roots played a leading role in erosion and they increased the soil moisture content in the shallow soil layer and created preferential infiltration flow paths 4 the porosity created by roots also promoted erosion han et al 2016 spoil heaps are soil rock mixtures with an extremely heterogeneous material composition and great dispersion the typical characteristics of spoil heaps include a loose structure low internal friction angle and cohesion and a lack of plant roots and organic matter liu and hu 2008 the slope gradient in this study was 30 which is much higher than that in farmlands forestlands and wastelands yang et al 2017 found that the soil erosion benefit of hedgerows decreased as the slope gradient increased the gravel embedded in the spoil heaps increased the porosity of the soil rock mixtures and damaged the soil structure and the root system accelerated this damage and caused severe erosion fig 6 the stems and leaves also had a negative effect on reducing soil loss in our study the leaves increased the slr contribution rate to slr reduction 0 in the later stage 10 30 min during rainfall events for ag and cd at a rainfall intensity of 48 mm h 1 fig 4c and k respectively the slr of the ig treatments for ag and cd was higher than that of the nl treatments which implied that the leaves increased soil loss on the spoil heaps fig 3c and k respectively the reason may be that under the condition that the leaves are cut and only the roots and stems are retained nl raindrops directly contact the surface layer of the spoil heaps due to the low rainfall intensity the raindrop splashing ability is weak and a crust is formed on the spoil heap surface layer resulting in a thin water flow layer which reduces the raindrop forces and decreases their scouring ability abrahams et al 1995 vandervaere et al 1997 raindrops accumulated on the leaves as large raindrops and landed on the slope surface which increased the impact force on the surface layer thereby increasing the erosion under ag and cd however this situation did not occur for ms which may be caused by the different leaf morphologies burylo et al 2012 goebes et al 2015 the stem also had a negative effect on reducing soil under ag at rainfall intensities of 72 and 108 mm h 1 figs 3a and 4a and b and the contribution rates were 4 and 5 table 3 the stems changed the runoff path and increased the curvature of the runoff which may reduce the flow velocity which also prevented sediment transport and deposition around the stems wang et al 2021a however during the heavy rainfall intensity the deposited sediment flows with the runoff again causing serious soil erosion yang et al 2019 this may be due to the combined action of the stem and the exposed gravel i e that vortex runoff formed which led to an increase in the erosive force of the runoff eventually leading to serious erosion wang et al 2016 the effects of grass on soil loss reduction are the combined result of the aboveground parts stems and leaves and underground parts roots the aboveground parts protect soil from raindrop impact and runoff washing the presence of aboveground parts also increases the infiltration rate and surface roughness which also reduce soil loss resulting from the complex interactions within the root soil mixtures altering the mechanical and hydrological properties of the spoil heap soil eviner and chapin 2003 głąb and kacorzyk 2011 vannoppen et al 2015 specifically grass roots modify the soil aggregate stability cohesion infiltration rate moisture and organic matter contents which consequently negatively influence soil erodibility angers and caron 1998 traoré et al 2000 4 2 effects of grasses with different root architectures on soil loss reduction on spoil heaps the study also found that compared to the bs plots the grasses with taproot systems ag and fibrous root systems ms and cd almost equally reduced soil loss and the mean reduction effects were 93 92 and 89 respectively table 3 the root characteristics were scanned by an epson v700 fig 7 based on a single root system ag contained more fibrous roots and taproots cd did not contain taproots but had a high fibrous root content and ms contained taproots but fewer fibrous roots furthermore the root bulk densities of ag ms and cd were 20 50 4 39 and 46 15 mm3 cm 3 respectively the difference in root characteristics might not be the major factor affecting the soil loss on spoil heaps because the vegetation growth cycle is short and the unique characteristics of spoil heaps have led to changes in the effect of vegetation on soil loss previous studies have shown that grasses with fibrous root systems are more effective in reducing soil loss than grasses with taproot systems de baets et al 2007 stokes et al 2009 vannoppen et al 2017 plant species with fibrous roots more notably improve soil resistance to flow erosion than those with taproots głąb and kacorzyk 2011 these differences originate from the material composition of the surface layer previous studies have been conducted on natural slopes with gentle gravel free structures but this research focused on man made spoil heaps with a distinct structure and gravel content and steep slopes vannoppen et al 2017 pointed out that the soil texture and bulk density play major roles in the vegetation effect on soil erosion processes and both factors are related to soil cohesion fibrous root systems are the most effective in non cohesive soils while taproot systems are the most effective in cohesive soils since the natural slope is dominated by soil particles there is no or only a small amount of gravel but the bulk density of the spoil heaps is a soil rock mixed medium in our study the bulk density of the bs plots 1 33 g cm 3 was higher than that of the grass covered plots 1 19 1 25 g cm 3 while the initial moisture content of the grass covered plots 25 67 26 92 was higher than that of the bs plots 19 92 in contrast to the literature others found that the bulk density of natural slopes is 1 17 1 31 g cm 3 chen et al 2018 and 1 0 g cm 3 li and pan 2018 the spoil heaps contain gravel which causes the bulk density to be greater than that of a natural slope however compared with the bs plots after vegetation was planted the bulk density decreased which was most intuitively reflected in the change in the infiltration rate we measured the infiltration rate of the bs and grassed spoil heaps the results showed that the average infiltration rate of the bs was 3 81 mm s 1 for 20 cm of the spoil heap surface corresponding to ag ms and cd the average infiltration rates were 19 19 10 00 and 21 31 mm s 1 respectively this may explain why the vegetation with the taproot system had an equal effect on soil loss as the fibrous root system after vegetation was planted the infiltration rate of the surface layer of the spoil heaps increased significantly while runoff decreased this article focuses on the analysis of the changes in the erosion of spoil heaps by planting vegetation with the same gravel content 10 the gravel content is a fixed factor the difference in gravel characteristics content type distribution and the erosion difference between the spoil heaps and the natural slope are not the research content of this article but we have carried out a large number of simulation studies on the erosion difference of spoil heaps based on the gravel content and soil texture li et al 2016 2020a lv et al 2019 niu et al 2019 furthermore the grass root system and canopy have a distinct importance in the different erosion forms grass roots are more effective in controlling rill and gully erosion while canopies are more efficient in preventing interrill and splash detachment gyssels and poesen 2003 zuazo and pleguezuelo 2008 no obvious rills were observed for ag ms and cd under the different treatments in other words interrill erosion dominated the grass covered plots therefore the differences in soil loss reduction among ag ms and cd were likely caused by the different canopy covers of ag 80 ms 76 and cd 72 rather than by any differences among their root systems 4 3 effects of grasses on reducing soil loss depended on rainfall intensity the grass components contributed to the differently slr reduction effect depending on the rainfall intensity the grass root system played a major role in slr reduction and contributed 68 90 at a rainfall intensity of 48 mm h 1 however at intensities of 72 and 108 mm h 1 the canopies combined stems and leaves exhibited a higher contribution rate of 39 156 table 3 multiple rainfall intensity events showed that the contribution rates to slr reduction of the ag roots and canopies were 63 and 37 respectively while they were 28 and 72 and 15 and 85 for ms and cd respectively fig 8 these results indicate that based on the average of multiple rainfall events the grass with taproot systems reduced soil erosion via the effect of the roots whereas for the grass with fibrous root systems the canopy was more important for a single rainfall event the benefits of the aboveground parts regarding slr reduction were greater than those of the roots under heavy rainfall conditions while under light rainfall conditions slr reduction was affected more by the roots these results are inconsistent with those of gyssels et al 2005 and zuazo and pleguezuelo 2008 due to the different soil erosion types in our research rill and gully erosion did not occur and both the rainfall intensity and material composition of the surface layer affected the soil loss characteristics the slr volatility decreased after an initial increasing trend over time at the different rainfall intensities in the bs plots while it remained stable fig 3 and then continued to increase for the three grass species subjected to the three different treatments the grass species not only decreased soil loss on the spoil heaps but also delayed the severe erosion stage moreover during the later stage of the above rainfall events the slr of the ig treatments greatly fluctuated namely a trend of peaks and valleys fig 3c and k was observed in the later stage leading to an increase in the instantaneous slr which also occurred in a previous study of spoil heaps in the three gorges reservoir area peng et al 2014 zhang et al 2014 the instantaneous slr values in bs plots were ranged from 4 06 to 99 71 g m 2 min 1 while they were 0 11 38 07 g m 2 min 1 0 06 47 70 g m 2 min 1 and 0 29 91 81 g m 2 min 1 for ag ms and cd respectively under different treatments and rainfall intensities the results are consistent with those reported by chow and rees 1995 i e 1 5 6 0 g m 2 min 1 li and pan 2018 i e 49 0 g m 2 min 1 lv et al 2019 i e 48 0 84 0 g m 2 min 1 li et al 2020a i e 0 8 72 4 g m 2 min 1 but were lower than those reported by guo et al 2020a for slr i e 0 1 822 0 g m 2 min 1 and ding et al 2017 i e 250 0 g m 2 min 1 the difference may be caused by the experimental method and object the mean slr during the first 10 min after runoff generation in the bs plots was 1 36 1 89 times that during the later stage however these values accounted for 65 14 75 05 48 84 65 95 and 60 10 92 42 of the mean slr for ag ms and cd respectively our results are inconsistent with those of zhao et al 2017 who found that the erosion rate on bare slopes continued to increase over time while grass covered slopes showed a decreasing trend after an initial increasing trend li and pan 2018 reported that the erosion rate in bare slopes and slopes planted with three grass species under three different treatments revealed a decreasing trend after an initial increasing trend over time the difference may be caused by the different grass species and spoil heap characteristics 5 conclusions this study aimed to investigate the effects of different grass species under various treatments ig nl and or on the soil loss processes contribution rate to slr reduction and soil resistance of steep spoil heaps compared to the bs plots the slrs on the grass covered plots ig treatments were reduced by 84 99 and the grasses under the different treatments also delayed the severe erosion stage on the spoil heaps however the different treatments imposed a positive or negative effect on soil loss reduction which depended on the rainfall intensity and vegetation type cutting the leaves or stems led to varied soil loss effects and the higher the grass integrity the lower the erosion for grass with a fibrous root system the roots reduced soil loss by 68 90 at 48 mm h 1 while the canopies stems or leaves reduced soil loss by 39 156 at 72 and 108 mm h 1 the or treatments even increased soil loss and the contribution rate values to slr reduction ranged from 2 to 68 the grass species with a taproot system ag exerted an approximate effect on soil loss reduction to that exerted by those with fibrous root systems ms and cd the ig treatment reduced the soil erodibility kr by 81 43 83 80 while the kr value of the or treatments was 1 51 3 53 times that of the bs plots the grasses increased the critical shear stress τc on the spoil heaps 1 09 2 14 times higher than that in the bs plots our study results indicate that it is necessary to maintain grass integrity to minimize soil loss due to the lack of aboveground parts which increases soil loss the results can guide vegetation type selection for soil erosion control on spoil heaps 6 limitations and prospect of this study this research forces on the influence of two typical root structure vegetation types taproot system and fibrous root system on the soil loss rate and runoff shear force parameters of spoil heaps a heterogeneous medium formed in a short period of time with a mixture of soil and rock with a steep slope through field simulation rainfall tests this research clarified the contribution rate of roots stems and leaves of vegetation with taproot and fibrous root systems to reduce the soil loss rate of the spoil heaps additionally for soil rock mixed spoil heaps it is necessary to pay attention to the maintenance of vegetation and give full play to the aboveground parts including leaves and stems however the current analysis in this paper focuses on the soil loss rate and runoff shear stress and lacks the characteristics of vegetation root characteristics biomass the separation characteristics of sediment under the action of vegetation and the physical and chemical effects of vegetation on spoil heaps of soil and rock mixed media specific analysis of characteristics and other hydraulic parameters and hydrodynamic parameters is a shortcoming of this article and the focus of subsequent in depth research studying vegetation protection on spoil heaps not only improves the ecological environment and reduces soil erosion but also analyses from the perspective of sustainable development that spoil heaps are useful resources the effective ecological restoration of abandoned land resources can increase arable land and woodland resources more importantly it can also provide quantitative scientific guidance for the selection of grass species for rapid restoration of vegetation in a project construction area credit authorship contribution statement jianming li conceptualization data curation formal analysis investigation

4049,many countries use hydropower as their main source of power generation one of the factors responsible for erosion in hydroelectric reservoir margins is the action of wind induced waves which increases sedimentation and reduces their storage capacity despite potential economic and environmental damages research into wave erosion processes on reservoir margins are found mainly in cohesive soils from cold regions research on erosion by waves of cohesive soils from savannah regions which are commonly found in tropical reservoirs is incipient studies evaluating breaking and non breaking wave conditions on this type of erosion are especially important this work presents the results from 18 water wave channel experiments which were conducted to investigate the erosional processes by waves on lateritic soils under breaking wave and non breaking wave conditions as well as determining the spatial distribution of the resulting sediments lateritic soil samples were placed on the wave channel and different conditions were tested wave frequencies varied from 0 272 to 0 999 hz on four different beach slope angles of 22 50 30 00 45 00 and 60 00 degrees in 80 of the tests the erosion rate varied positively in a nonlinear form with the increase of the accumulated wave power however when the waves broke erosion rate sometimes varied negatively and the sediment production tended to be reduced high precision 3d surveys showed a good agreement between the maximum depth of the eroded surfaces and the power increase of the waves the average roughness of the samples increased in 90 of the tests the spatial distribution of sediments and their grain size distributions were also investigated the waves driving forces were incapable of transporting the sediments away from their source of origin and therefore were not able to change the natural distributions of the grains with the simulated conditions keywords erosion water wave channel lateritic soil sediments distribution laser scanning 1 introduction in many countries the construction of hydroelectric power plants with accumulation reservoirs continues to provide a viable option for renewable energy sources with low emissions of polluting gases despite the rapid development of wind and solar energy resource exploitation around world large hydroelectric plants still have the best rates of investment return castro and capellán pérez 2020 the u s energy information administration s 2019 report forecasted that in 2050 hydroelectricity will offer more than 5 trillion kilowatt hours for all member countries of the organisation for economic co operation and development oecd ieo 2019 in brazil hydroelectric energy accounts for 64 of the total installed power and the ministry of mines and energy foresees in its 10 year energy expansion plan 2021 2029 that the supply of this source in its integrated system will be expanded by 4 6 gw epe mme 2019 however once these reservoirs are operating their life span begins to be compromised by sedimentation reservoir sedimentation results as a function of different factors that include the reservoir design and its operation the local geology topography bathymetry climate vegetation and human occupation among others the average storage capacity reduction due to sedimentation in tropical reservoirs is quite variable previous works have pointed to storage reduction rates between 0 05 and 1 17 per year including in reservoirs in australia and brazil and reduction rates close to 10 per year in chinese reservoirs miranda and mauad 2014 cooper et al 2018 early works on reservoir sedimentation have highlighted wave erosion as an important source of sediments eakin and brown 1939 volker and henry 1988 and since then this phenomenon has been studied in different ways to predict or quantify wave erosion numerical models allow a low cost assessment of areas which are critically exposed in large reservoirs some models are based on wind directions speeds and fetch distances from the reservoir bhowmik 1975 metler et al 1975 owen 1988 kahma and calkoen 1992 yarde et al 1996 mel nikova et al 2012 other numerical studies have applied tools such as swan simulating waves nearshore or gis based methods to reservoirs to investigate wind induced wave erosivity vilmundardóttir et al 2010 codignotto et al 2012 vilhena et al 2019 the precision of numerical models is determined by the boundary conditions and adopted theoretical assumptions therefore comparing numerical predictions with field measurements always offers a good alternative for improving them marani et al 2011 conducted a study of the retreat of margins in the lagoon of venice and found a linear relation between the wave power w m and the volumetric erosion rate wu et al 2016 used measurements of wave parameters from a wave recorder and turbidity values of multiparameter probes on the chinese lake taihu and concluded that the concentration of eroded sediments was related to the ratio between the wave length and depth of the water l h laboratory studies on water wave channels and reduced models liang et al 2014 allow conditions to be controlled recio and oumeraci 2007 yasuharaa and recio 2007 faure et al 2010 li et al 2012 wave channel experiments with sandy beaches are widely found in the literature usually with beaches sloping from 13 to 26 6 degrees leading to wave break conditions bakhtyar et al 2011 saitoh and kobayashi 2012 khoury et al 2013 when the wave reaches a sufficiently shallow depth its steepness exceeds a limit value and the breaking starts following as a function of the depth and angle of the beach indeed most of the proposed wave break forecast models present empirical formulas which are improved with laboratory results associating parameters such as the original wave height h the initial wave length l0 the beach slope m and the wave break height hb goda 1970 komar and gaughan 1972 rattanapitikon and shibayama 2000 when the wave starts to run on a steep bottom it changes in its velocity and pressure profiles occur indeed previous works have investigated these changes under laboratory conditions cheng and hsu 2013 li et al 2013 buckley et al 2015 palmsten and splinter 2016 confirming that the waves lose a part of their potential energy before breaking so the wave erosion processes tend to be different in wave break and non break scenarios while wave channel experiments with sandy soils are more representative of coastal situations most of the reservoir margins of interest in this study have cohesive soils sunamura 1976 promoted artificial cohesion to a sand by poorly mixing it with cement and subjected it to wave erosion on slopes of 65 00 and 90 00 degrees without breaking waves and found a consistent increase in the eroded volume with test time skafel and bishop 1994 made experiments on wave channel intact samples of a silty clay collected in a region of canada at east of wheatley ontario with a cold climate undergoing wave breaking conditions and found evidence that the wave breaking pattern changed with advancing erosion faure et al 2010 tested on wave channel a compacted slopes of sandy silt collected in a cold region of southeastern france with slope angles between 21 00 and 26 60 degrees leading to wave break when the cohesive soil was placed at the bottom of the channel instead of an absorbing beach the pure wave erosion process and sediment transport were weak and slow maa 1988 ding et al 2018 the spatial distribution and concentration of the sediments resulting from erosion have also been the subject of previous field and laboratory research cáceres and alsina 2012 sadeghi and singh 2017 tian et al 2019 sediment particle sizes smaller than 63 μm include grains whose concentrations are more susceptible to the action of waves while the sediment transport distance is very short when only induced by wave action the cohesive soils studied in the cited articles were mostly collected in cold regions and were less weathered than those found in tropical regions in addition wave channel tests were carried out either in wave breaking conditions or in non breaking conditions with the beach angle fixed the main aim of this work was to investigate in a laboratory the process of erosion by waves on lateritic soils in breaking wave and non breaking wave conditions as well as to determine the spatial distribution of the resulting sediments the use of a high precision survey by 3d scanning laser for the analysis of the main changes on the surfaces of the tested samples also offered new findings about wave erosion in soils of this type 2 materials and methods 2 1 tested soils the wave channel experiments were performed in two types of lateritic soil samples remoulded samples here referred to as soil a and intact samples referred to as soil b first tests were carried out with remoulded samples to evaluate the methods of sample preparation and the test s executive sequence sequently the same methods were adapted for tests with intact samples soil a samples were provided from the federal university of goiás in goiânia brazil and had been collected at coordinates between 16 degrees40 38 3 s 49 degrees14 28 0 w from horizon b starting at a 10 cm depth the samples of soil b were collected at coordinates between 18 degrees23 1 76 s and 49 degrees3 26 02 w on the right bank of the itumbiara hpp hydroelectric power plant reservoir from horizon b starting at a 20 cm depth vilhena et al 2020 itumbiara is a brazilian hydroelectric plant located in the middle section of the paranaíba river basin between the states of goiás and minas gerais both collection areas are located in a tropical savannah region according to the köppen geiger climate classification peel et al 2007 the soil b collection point corresponds to an area which is critically exposed to wave erosion as identified by vilhena et al 2019 through gis analyses fig 1 shows the collection areas of soils a and b while table 1 summarises the main characteristics of the two tested soils soil a is a clayey sand and soil b is a clayey silt both have low plasticity and characteristics typical of fine lateritic soils lateritic soils contain grains with a high specific mass greater than2 7 g cm3 and grain fractions that are less than 2 mm and greater than 0 074 mm in size these mostly consist of quartz grains which in turn are commonly coated with fe and al oxides and hydroxides additionally these soils have little expansivity a high aggregation of clay particles was verified by the difference between the clay indices obtained with and without chemical dispersant treatments complementary analyses were carried out through observations of the mini variability of the specimens nogami and villibor 1991 and both soils were classified as lateritic the results obtained with the dye adsorption analyses ghosh and bhattacharyya 2002 hegyesi et al 2017 shown in table 1 indicated a low activity less than 11 10 3 g g typical of laterite or inert clay minerals the cation exchange capacity 3 meq 100 g and the specific surface 15 m2 g indicated a probable combination of inert clay minerals with traces of kaolinite in the x ray diffractometry analyses of the mineralogical composition of soil b the most frequent readings indicated that quartz was the main mineralogical compound as expected for lateritic sandy soils three other less frequently occurring subordinate minerals included gibbsite kaolinite and illite 2 2 experiment a wave channel built by menezes 2016 in the hydraulics laboratory at the federal university of goiás was used to simulate the erosion of the samples by wave action the equipment comprised a channel with an internal rectangular section with a 0 47 m width 1 20 m height and a total length of 10 m seeking lower interference from the reflection of the waves most of the previous works used channels of waves of more than 10 m length from 14 m jia et al 2014 to 104 m li et al 2012 however research considering wave channel lengths of 8 m faure et al 2010 and 10 m khoury et al 2013 can also be found in the literature a flap type wavemaker was fixed on the base of the channel as shown in fig 2 the channel walls consisted of 10 mm thick tempered glass plates supported by an external metallic structure and the floor was covered with the same material offering little friction to flow an electronic frequency inverter controlled the rotation speed of the motor the beach that hosted the sample holder had a slope which could be adjusted to four different angles 22 50 30 00 45 00 and 60 00 degrees at the opposite end of the wavemaker the chosen beach angles allowed the samples to be tested under conditions of breaking and non breaking waves and the results did not change significantly within the flat bottom channel region previous literature has reported a large spectrum of beach angles tested from 2 86 skafel and bishop 1994 to 90 00 degrees sunamura 1976 but angles lower than 30 degrees are more usual coops et al 1996 the wave parameters were determined based on the calibration of the wavemaker where the flap movement frequencies at different engine rotation speeds and the flap stroke extensions were checked at each depth the stroke corresponded to the longitudinal distance swept by the flap at the resting level of the water based on the velocity potential obtained for small amplitude waves dean and dalrymple 1991 souza et al 2003 proposed a transfer function between wave height and stroke that was in good agreement with measured data given by the following equation 1 h s 4 sinh k w h k w h k w h sinh k w h cosh k w h 1 sinh 2 k w h 2 k w h where h is the wave height in m s is the stroke in m h is the water depth at rest in m and kw is the wave number given by ratio 2π l with l being the wave length in m the kw wave number in turn can be obtained by the implicit resolution of the wave dispersion equation 2 σ w 2 g k w tanh k w h where σw is the wave frequency in rad s and g the gravitational acceleration in m s2 once the h wave height is computed the wave power pw in w m is calculated for shallow water waves by the equation 3 p w 1 8 ρ w g h 2 gh eq 3 in turn is a simplified version of the following power equation for general applications 4 p w 1 8 ρ w g h 2 gl 2 π tanh 2 π h l the modification of the komar and gaughan formula proposed by rattanapitikon and shibayama 2000 was used to compute the wave break parameters in wave break scenarios the modified semi empirical formula showed a relative error of 10 9 based on 24 previous experimental studies even with steeper beaches and is given below 5 h b 10 02 m 3 7 46 m 2 1 32 m 0 55 h h l 1 5 where hb is the wave height at the critical steepness before breaking and m is the tangent of the beach slope angle the water depth at wave break point hb is estimated with the following linear ratio 6 h b h b 0 78 the compacted samples of soil a were molded directly into the sample holder by manual layered compaction seeking a uniform compactness and degree of saturation the intact blocks of soil b were placed inside the sample holder where they were fixed internally with the application of a cement mortar and natural sand in a mass ratio of 1 3 respectively and a 0 45 water cement ratio once the sample holder had been properly supported on the adjustable ramp the channel was filled using the centrifugal pump to transfer clean water from the reservoirs to the channel the filling was done until about half of the flat section of the sample was submerged with the water at rest for each test configuration the samples were subjected to wave actions for a defined duration time without interruptions the collection of the resulting sediments was carried out separately in six different regions of the channel regions a b c d e and f as indicated in fig 3 each occurring at different distances from the tested sample immediately after the erodibility tests about 90 of the water was drained to auxiliary reservoirs the remaining water on the channel was drained 12 h later to allow the partial sedimentation of the soil the sediments were drained using an industrial vacuum following the internal and external marks that divided the channel into regions and in such a way as not to disturb the sediments in the neighbouring regions the sieving and analysis of the solids content by boiling allowed the calculation of the sediment mass deposited in each region the erosion rate was obtained by the total mass of sediments in kg m2 in relation to the sample s erodible area high definition surveys of the initial and final surfaces of the samples were made using a 3d handheld laser scanner the device used a class 2 laser with visible red light and performed 18 000 measurements per second with an accuracy of 0 100 mm the 3d surfaces obtained for the samples under the initial and final conditions were analysed with the 3dreshaper version 18 0 7 28912 software hexagon 2018 the analysis of the distribution of sediments was complemented with determinations of the distribution of the grain size of the sediments collected in the different regions of the channel analyses of the grain sizes were made using an automatic particle size analyser by means of laser diffraction and with photoelectric detectors with a measurement range between 0 02 and 2 800 μm the sediment samples were then analysed whilst suspended in distilled water and dispersed only mechanically with five minutes of ultrasound application before readings to simulate different conditions the experiments in the water wave channel were made through varying the wave frequency from 0 272 hz to 0 999 hz and the four beach angles between 22 50 and 60 00 degrees using empirical equations ekebom et al 2003 with fetch and wind speed data measured in the itumbiara reservoir vilhena et al 2019 alcântara et al 2010 the values calculated for peak frequencies were between 0 35 and 1 1 hz the interval chosen for the experiments from 0 27 to 0 99 hz comprises most of the predicted waves frequencies table 2 shows the details of each test s configuration enumerating them from 1 to 18 these numbers will be referred to in the discussion of the results the remoulded samples were tested on two different beach angles while the intact samples were tested on three different beach angles experimental tests were performed only once except the tests 7 and 16 which were repeated once each since comparing the erodibility of remoulded and intact samples is not the aim of this study only one of the beach angles was tested 45 00 degrees providing results for two types of samples the test duration times with remoulded and intact samples also were different 180 min for remoulded samples and 360 min for intact samples however this was normalised by adopting the accumulated power w m as a characteristic of each simulated condition 3 results and discussion 3 1 wave parameters and samples s initial conditions the parameters of the unrefracted waves height h period t length l and power p were computed using the frequency of the wavemaker and the water depth at rest h measured in each test table 3 lists the wave parameters computed from eq 1 eq 2 and eq 3 two thirds of all simulated waves were formedd under shallow water conditions in five simulations 7 8 14 16 and 17 the range of h l relation was 0 054 0 073 which is close to the superior limit of 0 05 for shallow water conditions a relation h l close to 0 05 with a low depth indicates similarities with those of a nearshore zone where the erosion by waves occurs however wave channel experiments under intermediate water conditions are not unusual with h l being equal to 0 104 coops et al 1996 or between 0 163 and 0 217 khoury et al 2013 the wave break events illustrated in fig 4 occurred only with beach angles of 22 50 and 30 00 degrees the wave height at breaking hb the wave s critical steepness hb lb the water depth at breaking hb and the estimated distance between the sample and the point of wave break xb were computed using the empirical equations eqs 5 and 6 table 4 higher waves tended to break farther from the samples than lower waves and dissipated part of their energy before reaching the beach all the parameters were computed based on unrefracted waves without considering the possible effects of refraction diffraction or secondary breaking in experiments with beach angles of 45 50 and 60 00 degrees the samples were subjected to periodic water level variations despite being two lateritic soils in comparing the initial degree of saturation of the samples which sums up the real grain density in a single value the initial water content and the void ratio it could be determined whether or not the a and b soils had similar initial conditions inside each group the group b of intact samples had a coefficient of variation of 6 78 while the group a of remoulded samples had a coefficient of variation of 18 55 both had three values outside the 95 confidence interval applying the mann whitney non parametric test it was clear that the average degree of saturation of the remoulded and intact samples was different with the average degree of saturation of the remoulded samples being significantly lower 3 2 erosion rates by wave action the measured erosion rates grouped according to the beach slope angle are presented in this section the erosion rate corresponds to the total mass of sediments indicated in kg m2 collected at the end of the experiment in relation to the sample s surface exposed to erosion the accumulated wave power corresponds to the sum of the power of each wave in w m during the experiment considering the wave period figs 5 6 7 and 8 show the results for the beach slope angles of 22 50 30 00 45 00 and 60 00 degrees respectively in these figures the experimental results are fitted in a curve that corresponds to a nonlinear regression with a lower residual error the rmse varied from 0 37 kg m2 with the intact samples tested on a 45 00 degree beach slope to 2 57 kg m2 with the intact samples tested on a 60 00 degree beach slope in four of the five obtained curves the increase of the erosion rate was concordant in a nonlinear form with the increase of the accumulated wave power despite different measurements in different soils previous work have indicated the same behaviour of the erosion rate with an increase in wave power coops et al 1996 marani et al 2011 codignotto et al 2012 the wave bottom shear stress hasn t been computed but according to the wavel channel tests of ding et al 2018 it shows a positive relationship with the wave height therefore the results presented here are in agreement with the studies of briaud et al 2001 and römkens et al 2002 these studies showed that in flume tests used to measure runoff erosion the shear stress applied by water to the soil is the determining parameter causing erosion however when sunamura 1976 tested the same soil under runoff and wave erosion the same bottom shear stress values promoted different erosion rates probably due to the associated uncertainty on determining of wave botton shear stress under wave breaking conditions the only exception in this study was the curve obtained with the intact samples on a 30 00 degree beach slope with inverse trend different physical characteristics of the samples were not responsible for the different rates of erosion observed this may instead be explained by the interaction between the complex processes of wave breaking and the type of absorbing beach used in this study the beach was not completely erodible indeed the erodible surface was equivalent to a restricted area exposed to water and surrounded by metal plates under these conditions depending on the point where the wave breaks most of its energy can dissipate over the sample or over the metallic structure however additional tests in wave break conditions would be necessary to support this assumption including the use of some numerical approaches comparing some dimensionless parameters such as the wave number kw and the wave slope h l it can be considered that some simulated waves are statistically similar experimental results with similar waves were here compared to evaluate the interference of the wave break with the erosion rate similar waves were considered to be those whose wave number kw differed by less than 0 13 in its absolute value or less than 10 and with a wave inclination h l varying by less than 0 02 in its absolute value fig 9 shows the variation of the wave power yield in the generation of sediments obtained by dividing the erosion rate by the accumulated wave power resulting a yield in kg wm computing the difference between the yield with wave break and the non breaking conditions yielded in 66 7 of the comparisons the difference was negative indicating that the yield of the wave power tended to be lower under wave break conditions this is in line with the previous literature which has pointed out that waves lose a considerable part of their potential energy even before breaking lin et al 2014 buckley et al 2015 3 3 analysis of the samples surfaces changes high precision 3d recording of the surfaces was made with laser scanning in ten experiments realised with intact samples the maximum eroded depths and how the process changed the surface roughness were measured by comparing the sample surfaces before and after the experiments fig 10 shows the analysis of the sample surfaces of tests 5 6 13 14 16 and 17 in the ten experiment two histograms of the elevation distributions measured in millimetres were produced before and after the experiment alongside a cross section including the point of the greatest final depth when evaluating the variation of the z axis at the point of greatest final depth a tendency towards a higher variation with the increase in the height of the wave and its power was perceived this is in accordance with the previous literature that indicated downcutting as the main erosion process in fine and cohesive soils sunamura 1976 davidson arnott and ollerhead 1995 however this relationship does not have an evident function the greater variation in the z axis did not always correspond to a higher rate of erosion in test 8 the variation in the z axis was 10 82 mm but the erosion rate was lower than that of test 5 which only deepened by 0 51 mm therefore in fine soils with considerable aggregation more diffuse erosion at shallow depths and over larger areas can produce more sediments which are relatively deeper erosionconcentrated in some points sunamura 1976 noted that small initial differences in sample surfaces such as irregularities and bumps can intensify erosion römkens et al 2002 reached a similar conclusion through runoff erosion testing because of how the samples were cut and smoothed before testing practically all the tests slightly promoted an increase in average roughness as shown in fig 11 only test 7 resulted in reduced roughness here represented by the standard deviation of the elevation in a direction perpendicular to the sample surface σ z in mm 1 3 4 sediments spatial distribution to investigate how the spatial distribution of the sediments resulting from erosion in the channel took place the sediments were collected separately in six regions of the channel identified from a to f as shown in fig 3 region a was furthest from the beach or sample and region f was nearest fig 12 present the results of the sediments distribution based on tests made with intact samples while in region f which is closer to the sample the percentage of the sediments collected mass statistically varied between 35 6 and 60 14 the same values varied between 1 47 and 25 64 in other regions tian et al 2019 have already shown that when the waves were the only agent of erosion the resultant sediments tended to concentrate next to their origin the granulometric analysis of the sediments indicated that most samples had the same effective diameter as those of the original soil fig 13 shows the d60 analysis of the sediments collected in each sector of the channel with the exception of sediments collected in region a the interval that comprised the effective diameter of the original soil with a 95 confidence had the highest concentration in terms of results this observation indicates that waves acting alone on the sample fail to promote the separation of naturally aggregated grain sizes pierce and nichols 1986 when studying river sediments concluded that unlike sandy sediments cohesive sediments tend to remain as loosely structured flocs indeed soil b intact samples presented an intense aggregation of grains especially for grains with diameters less than 0 01 mm considerable percentages appeared with d60 values which were much higher than the maximum expected values for the intact soil 0 057 mm which probably corresponded to aggregations that were not dispersed through ultrasound treatments 4 conclusions in 80 of all test setups the increase in the erosion rate was concordant in a nonlinear form with the increase of the accumulated wave power the analysis of the relationship between the erosion rate and the wave power in settings with and without wave break clearly shows that when the wave break occurs the wave s power yield in the generation of sediments tends to decrease the increase in the maximum depth of the eroded surfaces maximum δz shows a good agreement with the power increase of the waves however greater depths do not always correspond to a higher erosion rate indicating variations in the eroded volumes from more concentrated area on a few points capable of diffusing over larger areas of the samples the resulting sediments were deposited in higher concentrations in the regions closest to the obtained samples most of the effective particle size d60 of the sediments were coincident with the effective diameter of the intact soil considering a confidence interval of 95 indicating that wave action was insufficient to separate soil grain sizes credit authorship contribution statement marlon silva schliewe investigation formal analysis writing

4049,many countries use hydropower as their main source of power generation one of the factors responsible for erosion in hydroelectric reservoir margins is the action of wind induced waves which increases sedimentation and reduces their storage capacity despite potential economic and environmental damages research into wave erosion processes on reservoir margins are found mainly in cohesive soils from cold regions research on erosion by waves of cohesive soils from savannah regions which are commonly found in tropical reservoirs is incipient studies evaluating breaking and non breaking wave conditions on this type of erosion are especially important this work presents the results from 18 water wave channel experiments which were conducted to investigate the erosional processes by waves on lateritic soils under breaking wave and non breaking wave conditions as well as determining the spatial distribution of the resulting sediments lateritic soil samples were placed on the wave channel and different conditions were tested wave frequencies varied from 0 272 to 0 999 hz on four different beach slope angles of 22 50 30 00 45 00 and 60 00 degrees in 80 of the tests the erosion rate varied positively in a nonlinear form with the increase of the accumulated wave power however when the waves broke erosion rate sometimes varied negatively and the sediment production tended to be reduced high precision 3d surveys showed a good agreement between the maximum depth of the eroded surfaces and the power increase of the waves the average roughness of the samples increased in 90 of the tests the spatial distribution of sediments and their grain size distributions were also investigated the waves driving forces were incapable of transporting the sediments away from their source of origin and therefore were not able to change the natural distributions of the grains with the simulated conditions keywords erosion water wave channel lateritic soil sediments distribution laser scanning 1 introduction in many countries the construction of hydroelectric power plants with accumulation reservoirs continues to provide a viable option for renewable energy sources with low emissions of polluting gases despite the rapid development of wind and solar energy resource exploitation around world large hydroelectric plants still have the best rates of investment return castro and capellán pérez 2020 the u s energy information administration s 2019 report forecasted that in 2050 hydroelectricity will offer more than 5 trillion kilowatt hours for all member countries of the organisation for economic co operation and development oecd ieo 2019 in brazil hydroelectric energy accounts for 64 of the total installed power and the ministry of mines and energy foresees in its 10 year energy expansion plan 2021 2029 that the supply of this source in its integrated system will be expanded by 4 6 gw epe mme 2019 however once these reservoirs are operating their life span begins to be compromised by sedimentation reservoir sedimentation results as a function of different factors that include the reservoir design and its operation the local geology topography bathymetry climate vegetation and human occupation among others the average storage capacity reduction due to sedimentation in tropical reservoirs is quite variable previous works have pointed to storage reduction rates between 0 05 and 1 17 per year including in reservoirs in australia and brazil and reduction rates close to 10 per year in chinese reservoirs miranda and mauad 2014 cooper et al 2018 early works on reservoir sedimentation have highlighted wave erosion as an important source of sediments eakin and brown 1939 volker and henry 1988 and since then this phenomenon has been studied in different ways to predict or quantify wave erosion numerical models allow a low cost assessment of areas which are critically exposed in large reservoirs some models are based on wind directions speeds and fetch distances from the reservoir bhowmik 1975 metler et al 1975 owen 1988 kahma and calkoen 1992 yarde et al 1996 mel nikova et al 2012 other numerical studies have applied tools such as swan simulating waves nearshore or gis based methods to reservoirs to investigate wind induced wave erosivity vilmundardóttir et al 2010 codignotto et al 2012 vilhena et al 2019 the precision of numerical models is determined by the boundary conditions and adopted theoretical assumptions therefore comparing numerical predictions with field measurements always offers a good alternative for improving them marani et al 2011 conducted a study of the retreat of margins in the lagoon of venice and found a linear relation between the wave power w m and the volumetric erosion rate wu et al 2016 used measurements of wave parameters from a wave recorder and turbidity values of multiparameter probes on the chinese lake taihu and concluded that the concentration of eroded sediments was related to the ratio between the wave length and depth of the water l h laboratory studies on water wave channels and reduced models liang et al 2014 allow conditions to be controlled recio and oumeraci 2007 yasuharaa and recio 2007 faure et al 2010 li et al 2012 wave channel experiments with sandy beaches are widely found in the literature usually with beaches sloping from 13 to 26 6 degrees leading to wave break conditions bakhtyar et al 2011 saitoh and kobayashi 2012 khoury et al 2013 when the wave reaches a sufficiently shallow depth its steepness exceeds a limit value and the breaking starts following as a function of the depth and angle of the beach indeed most of the proposed wave break forecast models present empirical formulas which are improved with laboratory results associating parameters such as the original wave height h the initial wave length l0 the beach slope m and the wave break height hb goda 1970 komar and gaughan 1972 rattanapitikon and shibayama 2000 when the wave starts to run on a steep bottom it changes in its velocity and pressure profiles occur indeed previous works have investigated these changes under laboratory conditions cheng and hsu 2013 li et al 2013 buckley et al 2015 palmsten and splinter 2016 confirming that the waves lose a part of their potential energy before breaking so the wave erosion processes tend to be different in wave break and non break scenarios while wave channel experiments with sandy soils are more representative of coastal situations most of the reservoir margins of interest in this study have cohesive soils sunamura 1976 promoted artificial cohesion to a sand by poorly mixing it with cement and subjected it to wave erosion on slopes of 65 00 and 90 00 degrees without breaking waves and found a consistent increase in the eroded volume with test time skafel and bishop 1994 made experiments on wave channel intact samples of a silty clay collected in a region of canada at east of wheatley ontario with a cold climate undergoing wave breaking conditions and found evidence that the wave breaking pattern changed with advancing erosion faure et al 2010 tested on wave channel a compacted slopes of sandy silt collected in a cold region of southeastern france with slope angles between 21 00 and 26 60 degrees leading to wave break when the cohesive soil was placed at the bottom of the channel instead of an absorbing beach the pure wave erosion process and sediment transport were weak and slow maa 1988 ding et al 2018 the spatial distribution and concentration of the sediments resulting from erosion have also been the subject of previous field and laboratory research cáceres and alsina 2012 sadeghi and singh 2017 tian et al 2019 sediment particle sizes smaller than 63 μm include grains whose concentrations are more susceptible to the action of waves while the sediment transport distance is very short when only induced by wave action the cohesive soils studied in the cited articles were mostly collected in cold regions and were less weathered than those found in tropical regions in addition wave channel tests were carried out either in wave breaking conditions or in non breaking conditions with the beach angle fixed the main aim of this work was to investigate in a laboratory the process of erosion by waves on lateritic soils in breaking wave and non breaking wave conditions as well as to determine the spatial distribution of the resulting sediments the use of a high precision survey by 3d scanning laser for the analysis of the main changes on the surfaces of the tested samples also offered new findings about wave erosion in soils of this type 2 materials and methods 2 1 tested soils the wave channel experiments were performed in two types of lateritic soil samples remoulded samples here referred to as soil a and intact samples referred to as soil b first tests were carried out with remoulded samples to evaluate the methods of sample preparation and the test s executive sequence sequently the same methods were adapted for tests with intact samples soil a samples were provided from the federal university of goiás in goiânia brazil and had been collected at coordinates between 16 degrees40 38 3 s 49 degrees14 28 0 w from horizon b starting at a 10 cm depth the samples of soil b were collected at coordinates between 18 degrees23 1 76 s and 49 degrees3 26 02 w on the right bank of the itumbiara hpp hydroelectric power plant reservoir from horizon b starting at a 20 cm depth vilhena et al 2020 itumbiara is a brazilian hydroelectric plant located in the middle section of the paranaíba river basin between the states of goiás and minas gerais both collection areas are located in a tropical savannah region according to the köppen geiger climate classification peel et al 2007 the soil b collection point corresponds to an area which is critically exposed to wave erosion as identified by vilhena et al 2019 through gis analyses fig 1 shows the collection areas of soils a and b while table 1 summarises the main characteristics of the two tested soils soil a is a clayey sand and soil b is a clayey silt both have low plasticity and characteristics typical of fine lateritic soils lateritic soils contain grains with a high specific mass greater than2 7 g cm3 and grain fractions that are less than 2 mm and greater than 0 074 mm in size these mostly consist of quartz grains which in turn are commonly coated with fe and al oxides and hydroxides additionally these soils have little expansivity a high aggregation of clay particles was verified by the difference between the clay indices obtained with and without chemical dispersant treatments complementary analyses were carried out through observations of the mini variability of the specimens nogami and villibor 1991 and both soils were classified as lateritic the results obtained with the dye adsorption analyses ghosh and bhattacharyya 2002 hegyesi et al 2017 shown in table 1 indicated a low activity less than 11 10 3 g g typical of laterite or inert clay minerals the cation exchange capacity 3 meq 100 g and the specific surface 15 m2 g indicated a probable combination of inert clay minerals with traces of kaolinite in the x ray diffractometry analyses of the mineralogical composition of soil b the most frequent readings indicated that quartz was the main mineralogical compound as expected for lateritic sandy soils three other less frequently occurring subordinate minerals included gibbsite kaolinite and illite 2 2 experiment a wave channel built by menezes 2016 in the hydraulics laboratory at the federal university of goiás was used to simulate the erosion of the samples by wave action the equipment comprised a channel with an internal rectangular section with a 0 47 m width 1 20 m height and a total length of 10 m seeking lower interference from the reflection of the waves most of the previous works used channels of waves of more than 10 m length from 14 m jia et al 2014 to 104 m li et al 2012 however research considering wave channel lengths of 8 m faure et al 2010 and 10 m khoury et al 2013 can also be found in the literature a flap type wavemaker was fixed on the base of the channel as shown in fig 2 the channel walls consisted of 10 mm thick tempered glass plates supported by an external metallic structure and the floor was covered with the same material offering little friction to flow an electronic frequency inverter controlled the rotation speed of the motor the beach that hosted the sample holder had a slope which could be adjusted to four different angles 22 50 30 00 45 00 and 60 00 degrees at the opposite end of the wavemaker the chosen beach angles allowed the samples to be tested under conditions of breaking and non breaking waves and the results did not change significantly within the flat bottom channel region previous literature has reported a large spectrum of beach angles tested from 2 86 skafel and bishop 1994 to 90 00 degrees sunamura 1976 but angles lower than 30 degrees are more usual coops et al 1996 the wave parameters were determined based on the calibration of the wavemaker where the flap movement frequencies at different engine rotation speeds and the flap stroke extensions were checked at each depth the stroke corresponded to the longitudinal distance swept by the flap at the resting level of the water based on the velocity potential obtained for small amplitude waves dean and dalrymple 1991 souza et al 2003 proposed a transfer function between wave height and stroke that was in good agreement with measured data given by the following equation 1 h s 4 sinh k w h k w h k w h sinh k w h cosh k w h 1 sinh 2 k w h 2 k w h where h is the wave height in m s is the stroke in m h is the water depth at rest in m and kw is the wave number given by ratio 2π l with l being the wave length in m the kw wave number in turn can be obtained by the implicit resolution of the wave dispersion equation 2 σ w 2 g k w tanh k w h where σw is the wave frequency in rad s and g the gravitational acceleration in m s2 once the h wave height is computed the wave power pw in w m is calculated for shallow water waves by the equation 3 p w 1 8 ρ w g h 2 gh eq 3 in turn is a simplified version of the following power equation for general applications 4 p w 1 8 ρ w g h 2 gl 2 π tanh 2 π h l the modification of the komar and gaughan formula proposed by rattanapitikon and shibayama 2000 was used to compute the wave break parameters in wave break scenarios the modified semi empirical formula showed a relative error of 10 9 based on 24 previous experimental studies even with steeper beaches and is given below 5 h b 10 02 m 3 7 46 m 2 1 32 m 0 55 h h l 1 5 where hb is the wave height at the critical steepness before breaking and m is the tangent of the beach slope angle the water depth at wave break point hb is estimated with the following linear ratio 6 h b h b 0 78 the compacted samples of soil a were molded directly into the sample holder by manual layered compaction seeking a uniform compactness and degree of saturation the intact blocks of soil b were placed inside the sample holder where they were fixed internally with the application of a cement mortar and natural sand in a mass ratio of 1 3 respectively and a 0 45 water cement ratio once the sample holder had been properly supported on the adjustable ramp the channel was filled using the centrifugal pump to transfer clean water from the reservoirs to the channel the filling was done until about half of the flat section of the sample was submerged with the water at rest for each test configuration the samples were subjected to wave actions for a defined duration time without interruptions the collection of the resulting sediments was carried out separately in six different regions of the channel regions a b c d e and f as indicated in fig 3 each occurring at different distances from the tested sample immediately after the erodibility tests about 90 of the water was drained to auxiliary reservoirs the remaining water on the channel was drained 12 h later to allow the partial sedimentation of the soil the sediments were drained using an industrial vacuum following the internal and external marks that divided the channel into regions and in such a way as not to disturb the sediments in the neighbouring regions the sieving and analysis of the solids content by boiling allowed the calculation of the sediment mass deposited in each region the erosion rate was obtained by the total mass of sediments in kg m2 in relation to the sample s erodible area high definition surveys of the initial and final surfaces of the samples were made using a 3d handheld laser scanner the device used a class 2 laser with visible red light and performed 18 000 measurements per second with an accuracy of 0 100 mm the 3d surfaces obtained for the samples under the initial and final conditions were analysed with the 3dreshaper version 18 0 7 28912 software hexagon 2018 the analysis of the distribution of sediments was complemented with determinations of the distribution of the grain size of the sediments collected in the different regions of the channel analyses of the grain sizes were made using an automatic particle size analyser by means of laser diffraction and with photoelectric detectors with a measurement range between 0 02 and 2 800 μm the sediment samples were then analysed whilst suspended in distilled water and dispersed only mechanically with five minutes of ultrasound application before readings to simulate different conditions the experiments in the water wave channel were made through varying the wave frequency from 0 272 hz to 0 999 hz and the four beach angles between 22 50 and 60 00 degrees using empirical equations ekebom et al 2003 with fetch and wind speed data measured in the itumbiara reservoir vilhena et al 2019 alcântara et al 2010 the values calculated for peak frequencies were between 0 35 and 1 1 hz the interval chosen for the experiments from 0 27 to 0 99 hz comprises most of the predicted waves frequencies table 2 shows the details of each test s configuration enumerating them from 1 to 18 these numbers will be referred to in the discussion of the results the remoulded samples were tested on two different beach angles while the intact samples were tested on three different beach angles experimental tests were performed only once except the tests 7 and 16 which were repeated once each since comparing the erodibility of remoulded and intact samples is not the aim of this study only one of the beach angles was tested 45 00 degrees providing results for two types of samples the test duration times with remoulded and intact samples also were different 180 min for remoulded samples and 360 min for intact samples however this was normalised by adopting the accumulated power w m as a characteristic of each simulated condition 3 results and discussion 3 1 wave parameters and samples s initial conditions the parameters of the unrefracted waves height h period t length l and power p were computed using the frequency of the wavemaker and the water depth at rest h measured in each test table 3 lists the wave parameters computed from eq 1 eq 2 and eq 3 two thirds of all simulated waves were formedd under shallow water conditions in five simulations 7 8 14 16 and 17 the range of h l relation was 0 054 0 073 which is close to the superior limit of 0 05 for shallow water conditions a relation h l close to 0 05 with a low depth indicates similarities with those of a nearshore zone where the erosion by waves occurs however wave channel experiments under intermediate water conditions are not unusual with h l being equal to 0 104 coops et al 1996 or between 0 163 and 0 217 khoury et al 2013 the wave break events illustrated in fig 4 occurred only with beach angles of 22 50 and 30 00 degrees the wave height at breaking hb the wave s critical steepness hb lb the water depth at breaking hb and the estimated distance between the sample and the point of wave break xb were computed using the empirical equations eqs 5 and 6 table 4 higher waves tended to break farther from the samples than lower waves and dissipated part of their energy before reaching the beach all the parameters were computed based on unrefracted waves without considering the possible effects of refraction diffraction or secondary breaking in experiments with beach angles of 45 50 and 60 00 degrees the samples were subjected to periodic water level variations despite being two lateritic soils in comparing the initial degree of saturation of the samples which sums up the real grain density in a single value the initial water content and the void ratio it could be determined whether or not the a and b soils had similar initial conditions inside each group the group b of intact samples had a coefficient of variation of 6 78 while the group a of remoulded samples had a coefficient of variation of 18 55 both had three values outside the 95 confidence interval applying the mann whitney non parametric test it was clear that the average degree of saturation of the remoulded and intact samples was different with the average degree of saturation of the remoulded samples being significantly lower 3 2 erosion rates by wave action the measured erosion rates grouped according to the beach slope angle are presented in this section the erosion rate corresponds to the total mass of sediments indicated in kg m2 collected at the end of the experiment in relation to the sample s surface exposed to erosion the accumulated wave power corresponds to the sum of the power of each wave in w m during the experiment considering the wave period figs 5 6 7 and 8 show the results for the beach slope angles of 22 50 30 00 45 00 and 60 00 degrees respectively in these figures the experimental results are fitted in a curve that corresponds to a nonlinear regression with a lower residual error the rmse varied from 0 37 kg m2 with the intact samples tested on a 45 00 degree beach slope to 2 57 kg m2 with the intact samples tested on a 60 00 degree beach slope in four of the five obtained curves the increase of the erosion rate was concordant in a nonlinear form with the increase of the accumulated wave power despite different measurements in different soils previous work have indicated the same behaviour of the erosion rate with an increase in wave power coops et al 1996 marani et al 2011 codignotto et al 2012 the wave bottom shear stress hasn t been computed but according to the wavel channel tests of ding et al 2018 it shows a positive relationship with the wave height therefore the results presented here are in agreement with the studies of briaud et al 2001 and römkens et al 2002 these studies showed that in flume tests used to measure runoff erosion the shear stress applied by water to the soil is the determining parameter causing erosion however when sunamura 1976 tested the same soil under runoff and wave erosion the same bottom shear stress values promoted different erosion rates probably due to the associated uncertainty on determining of wave botton shear stress under wave breaking conditions the only exception in this study was the curve obtained with the intact samples on a 30 00 degree beach slope with inverse trend different physical characteristics of the samples were not responsible for the different rates of erosion observed this may instead be explained by the interaction between the complex processes of wave breaking and the type of absorbing beach used in this study the beach was not completely erodible indeed the erodible surface was equivalent to a restricted area exposed to water and surrounded by metal plates under these conditions depending on the point where the wave breaks most of its energy can dissipate over the sample or over the metallic structure however additional tests in wave break conditions would be necessary to support this assumption including the use of some numerical approaches comparing some dimensionless parameters such as the wave number kw and the wave slope h l it can be considered that some simulated waves are statistically similar experimental results with similar waves were here compared to evaluate the interference of the wave break with the erosion rate similar waves were considered to be those whose wave number kw differed by less than 0 13 in its absolute value or less than 10 and with a wave inclination h l varying by less than 0 02 in its absolute value fig 9 shows the variation of the wave power yield in the generation of sediments obtained by dividing the erosion rate by the accumulated wave power resulting a yield in kg wm computing the difference between the yield with wave break and the non breaking conditions yielded in 66 7 of the comparisons the difference was negative indicating that the yield of the wave power tended to be lower under wave break conditions this is in line with the previous literature which has pointed out that waves lose a considerable part of their potential energy even before breaking lin et al 2014 buckley et al 2015 3 3 analysis of the samples surfaces changes high precision 3d recording of the surfaces was made with laser scanning in ten experiments realised with intact samples the maximum eroded depths and how the process changed the surface roughness were measured by comparing the sample surfaces before and after the experiments fig 10 shows the analysis of the sample surfaces of tests 5 6 13 14 16 and 17 in the ten experiment two histograms of the elevation distributions measured in millimetres were produced before and after the experiment alongside a cross section including the point of the greatest final depth when evaluating the variation of the z axis at the point of greatest final depth a tendency towards a higher variation with the increase in the height of the wave and its power was perceived this is in accordance with the previous literature that indicated downcutting as the main erosion process in fine and cohesive soils sunamura 1976 davidson arnott and ollerhead 1995 however this relationship does not have an evident function the greater variation in the z axis did not always correspond to a higher rate of erosion in test 8 the variation in the z axis was 10 82 mm but the erosion rate was lower than that of test 5 which only deepened by 0 51 mm therefore in fine soils with considerable aggregation more diffuse erosion at shallow depths and over larger areas can produce more sediments which are relatively deeper erosionconcentrated in some points sunamura 1976 noted that small initial differences in sample surfaces such as irregularities and bumps can intensify erosion römkens et al 2002 reached a similar conclusion through runoff erosion testing because of how the samples were cut and smoothed before testing practically all the tests slightly promoted an increase in average roughness as shown in fig 11 only test 7 resulted in reduced roughness here represented by the standard deviation of the elevation in a direction perpendicular to the sample surface σ z in mm 1 3 4 sediments spatial distribution to investigate how the spatial distribution of the sediments resulting from erosion in the channel took place the sediments were collected separately in six regions of the channel identified from a to f as shown in fig 3 region a was furthest from the beach or sample and region f was nearest fig 12 present the results of the sediments distribution based on tests made with intact samples while in region f which is closer to the sample the percentage of the sediments collected mass statistically varied between 35 6 and 60 14 the same values varied between 1 47 and 25 64 in other regions tian et al 2019 have already shown that when the waves were the only agent of erosion the resultant sediments tended to concentrate next to their origin the granulometric analysis of the sediments indicated that most samples had the same effective diameter as those of the original soil fig 13 shows the d60 analysis of the sediments collected in each sector of the channel with the exception of sediments collected in region a the interval that comprised the effective diameter of the original soil with a 95 confidence had the highest concentration in terms of results this observation indicates that waves acting alone on the sample fail to promote the separation of naturally aggregated grain sizes pierce and nichols 1986 when studying river sediments concluded that unlike sandy sediments cohesive sediments tend to remain as loosely structured flocs indeed soil b intact samples presented an intense aggregation of grains especially for grains with diameters less than 0 01 mm considerable percentages appeared with d60 values which were much higher than the maximum expected values for the intact soil 0 057 mm which probably corresponded to aggregations that were not dispersed through ultrasound treatments 4 conclusions in 80 of all test setups the increase in the erosion rate was concordant in a nonlinear form with the increase of the accumulated wave power the analysis of the relationship between the erosion rate and the wave power in settings with and without wave break clearly shows that when the wave break occurs the wave s power yield in the generation of sediments tends to decrease the increase in the maximum depth of the eroded surfaces maximum δz shows a good agreement with the power increase of the waves however greater depths do not always correspond to a higher erosion rate indicating variations in the eroded volumes from more concentrated area on a few points capable of diffusing over larger areas of the samples the resulting sediments were deposited in higher
