6840,typhoon haiyan made landfall in the central philippines on 8 november 2013 as one of the strongest tropical cyclones ever it also affected a 23 year old multi species reforest at manobo near tacloban city on leyte island as part of a larger hydrological investigation of the impacts of reforestation on streamflow response in the tacloban area gross rainfall p throughfall tf 24 roving collectors and stemflow sf 12 trees were monitored at manobo between june 2013 and may 2014 leaf area index lai above each tf collector was measured regularly total rainfall interception losses i were determined using gash s revised analytical model for three consecutive periods i pre haiyan baseline ii post haiyan damaged canopy and iii after initial canopy recovery modeled i was 18 of p before disturbance 12 for the period with the most extensive canopy damage and 17 5 after initial canopy recovery stemflow was low and weighted mean values accounted for 2 7 1 3 and 2 0 of p for the respective periods contrasts in period average values of i reflected changes in lai as well as wet canopy evaporation rates storm based tf fractions at the 5 m 5 m sub plot scale were inversely related to lai especially for small storms and low rainfall intensities inferred hourly rates of wet canopy evaporation showed a strong positive relationship to hourly rainfall intensity during large storms the revised analytical model was also run using pre disturbance parameter values for the entire year to assess the overall effect of canopy damage on i estimated annual losses with and without canopy disturbance were 514 mm 15 of p and 572 mm 17 respectively thus observed and inferred changes in rainfall partitioning after canopy disturbance and initial recovery were comparatively modest likely because the measurement site was relatively sheltered from the winds during typhoon passage and re foliation relatively rapid however given the predicted increase in occurrence of super typhoons due to continued global warming and oceanic freshening the structure of forests in affected regions can be expected to be modified with potential consequences for rainfall partitioning and hydrological response keywords leaf area index leyte island reforestation stemflow throughfall wet canopy evaporation 1 introduction the natural succession of the vegetation in humid tropical areas subject to intensifying slash and burn cultivation is often arrested by repeated fire and so called fire climax grasslands tend to form instead garrity et al 1997 hooper et al 2005 styger et al 2007 soils associated with these imperata and saccharum dominated grasslands can be physically and chemically degraded rendering them relatively unproductive ohta 1990 santoso et al 1997 and prone to overland flow generation chandler and walter 1998 zhang et al 2018a b and surface erosion especially when grazed concepcion and samar 1995 snelder 2001 ziegler et al 2009 in response to these problems fire climax grasslands across the tropics are being targeted increasingly for conversion to more productive and environmentally favourable forms of land use such as reforestation and agroforestry otsamo et al 1997 murniati 2002 wishnie et al 2007 snelder and lasco 2008 ancog et al 2016 although the harsh environmental conditions and recurring fires typically associated with these grasslands tend to preclude the natural re establishment of forest the grasses can be shaded out by planting fast growing tree species in combination with intensive initial site management otsamo 2000 murniati 2002 the associated improvements in below canopy micro climatic conditions reduce the competitive ability of the grasses and promote the germination and development of native tree seedlings resulting in mixed stands with the planted usually exotic species dominating the main canopy and naturally regenerating native species being dominant in the understory lamb 1998 otsamo 2000 cf wills et al 2016 thus although upon maturation the resulting forest neither classifies as a pure plantation nor as fully naturally developed secondary forest a multi species ecosystem is created that may be appropriately called a reforest chazdon et al 2016 secondary forests and reforests in various stages of growth constitute the dominant forest type nowadays in many humid tropical regions fao 2010

streamflow beck et al 2013 lacombe et al 2016 remains limited the philippines where imperata grasslands are referred to as cogon represents a case in point due to heavy logging and decades of slash and burn cultivation nearly 60 9 3 mha of all land officially designated to be under forest is actually without trees including up to 5 mha of cogon garrity et al 1997 lasco and pulhin 2006 and in need of ecological rehabilitation pulhin et al 2006 asio et al 2009 the country launched an ambitious national greening program in 2011 targeting the planting of trees on 1 5 million ha of degraded land much of it cogon aquino and daquio 2014 according to fao 2016 the philippines reforested 240 000 ha between 2010 and 2015 thus reversing the net loss of forest cover in the previous years to a net gain although tree planting on grass and shrubland has generally resulted in decreases in water yield world wide farley et al 2005 ford et al 2011 lacombe et al 2016 claims of a positive effect on dry season flows are occasionally reported zhou et al 2010 krishnaswamy et al 2012 cf scott et al 2005 as part of an investigation into a similar claim that formerly ephemeral streamflow became perennial about seven to eight years after reforesting cogon grassland in north eastern leyte island the philippines u padecio personal communication we measured rainfall interception losses i between june 2013 and may 2014 in the 23 year old community managed manobo reforest near tacloban city values of i for semi mature 10 25 years old secondary tropical forests are often already indistinguishable from those reported for old growth forests e g hölscher et al 1998 macinnis ng et al 2012 zimmermann et al 2013 moreover average i from tropical forests subject to maritime climatic conditions like those prevailing in the philippines tends to be roughly twice that inferred for forests at mid continental locations roberts et al 2005 wallace and mcjannet 2008 while the reasons for this contrast are debated in terms of the exact mechanisms involved and the sources of the non radiant energy required to sustain such high rates of evaporation see discussion in holwerda et al 2012 and van dijk et al 2015 the impact of the high i observed for maritime tropical forests on the overall water budget is potentially large mcjannet et al 2007 cf roberts et al 2005 the philippine region experiences 6 9 tropical cyclone passages on average per year cinco et al 2016 and on 8 november 2013 the manobo reforest was hit by one of the strongest and most devastating events on record super typhoon haiyan locally called yolanda nguyen et al 2014 rabonza et al 2015 it also affected the manobo reforest this presented an opportunity to study the changes in i associated with i intensive forest disturbance and damage and ii subsequent partial canopy recovery despite the expected increase in general typhoon strength knutson et al 2010 kossin et al 2014 and the frequency of super typhoons in particular due to global warming induced upper oceanic freshening balaguru et al 2016 studies of the effects of tropical forest disturbance by extreme winds as opposed to gap creation by selective logging asdak et al 1998b chappell et al 2001 on the magnitude of i are comparatively rare scatena et al 1996 waterloo et al 1999 heartsill scalley et al 2007 the effect has been shown to last up to a year depending on the degree of canopy disturbance and the rate of re foliation scatena et al 1996 waterloo 1994 hu and smith 2018 point measurements of canopy drip in intact tropical forests have also been shown to be inversely related to the density of the canopy overhead burghouts et al 1998 fleischbein et al 2005 holwerda 2005 zimmermann et al 2013 we therefore hypothesized a strong initial decrease in i after opening up of the forest canopy by typhoon haiyan followed by a gradual return to pre disturbance values as the forest s foliage recovered cf heartsill scalley et al

subsequently rattans calamus spp and various medicinal plants were added u padecio personal communication at the start of the study june 2013 the 23 year old forest consisted of a mixture of these

determination of rainfall interception rainfall interception loss i in mm collection was determined as the difference between gross rainfall p in mm collection and net precipitation i e throughfall tf stemflow sf both in mm collection over the one year study period 1 june 2013 31 may 2014 gross rainfall was measured in an agricultural patch just east of the manobo forest at an elevation of 40 m a s l as well as on the upper ridge of the study catchment at 220 m a s l using a tipping bucket rain gauge rg3 onset computer corporation usa connected to a hobo pendant event data logger the resolution of the rainfall recorders was 0 25 mm per tip confirmed by manual calibration single tips making up 0 85 of the annual total were not included in the evaluation of rainfall characteristics because of the unknown duration of rainfall they represented events were separated by a rainless period of at least 4 h to allow full drying of the canopy schellekens et al 1999 dietz et al 2006 the orifices of the two recording rain gauges were placed at 1 m above ground level to avoid ground splash effects generally the average of the amount recorded by the upper and lower tipping bucket gauges was used as the rainfall input for the interception measurement plot which was situated at an intermediate elevation of 110 m a s l occasional gaps in the record of either gauge were filled using corresponding data for the other recording gauge as the respective rainfall amounts were strongly correlated p upper 0 91 p lower r2 0 975 no correction was made for wind speeds which were generally low 1 9 m s 1 on average at tacloban airport and 1 7 m s 1 at an exposed hilltop in the nearby 3 5 km basper grassland catchment not even during typhoon haiyan because potential corrections at such extreme wind speeds would lead to very high but unverifiable rainfall inputs cf førland et al 1996 instead it was assumed that the amount of rainfall measured at a relatively sheltered valley bottom site in the basper grassland during typhoon haiyan was representative for the rainfall at the study forest in addition the catch of a recording cylindrical fog gauge located next to the anemometer at the basper hilltop and having a 100 catch efficiency for near horizontal wind driven rain frumau et al 2011 was used to estimate the extra inputs of wind driven rain during the haiyan event because this type of passive fog gauge has a higher catch efficiency than does a live vegetation canopy bruijnzeel et al 2005 the resulting catch must be considered to represent a maximum value a standard manual rain gauge 100 cm2 orifice was placed next to the lower recording gauge as a check event rainfall totals for each gauge type did not differ significantly and were strongly correlated plower 1 01pstandard r2 0 98 in addition a manual collector of the same type as used for the tf measurements see below for description was placed next to the lower recording gauge again measurements for the two types of gauges were strongly correlated y 1 05x where y manual gauge and x recording gauge r2 0 99 before typhoon haiyan the manual rainfall and tf gauges were generally emptied after each significant event i e on the same day or the next however after the passage of typhoon haiyan on 8 november 2013 the trail to access the interception measurement site was blocked by numerous fallen trees and branches and the sampling frequency was decreased to once a week or occasionally longer until late february 2014 from early march onwards until the end of the study period measurements were typically taken every five days the continuous records of p and tf gutters were used to identify single storms during such intervals throughfall tf was measured in the 10 m 60 m mid elevation plot cf supplementary fig 1c one tf gauge was assigned to each of 24 i e two parallel rows of 12 sub plots 5 m 5 m each and moved to a new random location within the sub plot after being emptied for optimal sampling of so called drip points where tf tends to concentrate as a result of tree architecture lloyd and de marques filho 1988 holwerda et al 2006 each tf gauge consisted of an 18 litre collector with a 25 cm diameter funnel a metal wire mesh 1 cm 1 cm grid was placed inside the funnel to minimize coarse organic debris entering the sample whereas a ping pong ball was placed in the centre of the funnel to minimize evaporative losses the collectors were stabilized by placing them inside a metal holder equipped with pins that were pushed into the soil measured tf volumes were converted to equivalent water depth in mm by dividing the volume of water in each gauge by the funnel area 491 cm2 next the regression equation linking the catch of the manual tf type gauge placed in the clearing next to the lower recording rain gauge was used to correct the amounts of tf collected by the funnel type gauges in addition tf was measured continuously using two fixed v shaped stainless steel gutters 200 cm 30 cm 15 cm each the gutters were placed at ca 1 m above the forest floor to avoid splash in from the ground and at an angle of 10 to the horizontal to encourage rapid drainage losses by splash from the gutter system were minimized by the v shaped nature of the sides of the gutter each gutter was equipped with a tipping bucket 50 ml per tip confirmed by manual calibration up to intensities of 2 5 mm min 1 plus a data logger hobo pendant event logger onset computer corporation usa the drainage slot at the end of each gutter was covered by a metal mesh to minimize entry of organic debris the collecting surface of the gutters was cleaned regularly tf volumes measured by the gutters were similarly converted to equivalent water depths in mm by dividing water volumes by gutter area corrected for gutter inclination the catch of the two gutters was strongly correlated both before r2 0 76 and especially after typhoon passage r2 0 96 1 00 depending on the period considered and the respective equations were used for occasional gap filling finally the amounts of tf collected by the recording gutters and the funnel type gauges were averaged using a weighting procedure that took the relative surface areas of the two types of gauges into account cf ghimire et al 2017 stemflow sf was measured for 12 trees which were selected on the basis of three dbh categories four trees per category small dbh 5 10 cm intermediate dbh 10 20 cm and large dbh 20 cm each tree was equipped with a 25 mm small trees or 64 mm large and intermediate trees diameter plastic hose slit open along its length and fastened tightly in a spiral fashion around the tree trunk using nails and silicon sealant each collar ended in a 22 litre container stemflow volumes were measured at the same time as tf to scale up to the plot level sf was converted to unit ground area mm for a given tree category by dividing the total volume in litres generated by all trees of that diameter class present within the plot by the plot area 520 m2 corrected for slope inclination total sf generated by all trees dbh 5 cm within the plot was derived as 1 sf s f small a s f medium b s f large c a where sfsmall sfmedium and sflarge are the average volumes of stemflow for the respective tree size classes per event in litres a is the plot area m2 corrected for the average ground slope of 30 and a b and c denote the number of small medium and large trees present in the interception measurement plot 51 19 and 12 respectively it is recognized that the amounts of sf obtained with eq 1 may represent an under estimate because stemflow was not measured on trees and saplings with a dbh 5 cm although sf volumes associated with these small trees and saplings are generally small on a per tree basis their contribution to overall plot scale sf can be significant in forests where they occur in large numbers manfroi et al 2004 gonzález martínez et al 2017 the density of trees and saplings with dbh 5 cm at manobo was not quantified hence the possible degree of under estimation of plot scale sf by the exclusion of contributions by very small trees cannot be determined although the overall absolute effect is likely to be limited 3 1 2 leaf area index to explore how changes in canopy density might affect rainfall interception loss cf fleischbein et al 2005 lai was measured during overcast conditions on 12 occasions between early june and late october 2013 at intervals of 1 3 weeks at 24 positions within the middle 600 m2 interception study plot using a cid bio science ci 110 plant canopy imager cf supplementary fig 1d no corrections were applied to account for the effect of the measurements being conducted on a fairly steep slope as the main focus was placed on relative differences in lai and the associated over estimation was expected to be systematic and more or less constant lin et al 2011 due to the difficulty of access associated with the infrastructural havoc brought about by typhoon haiyan in the tacloban area in november 2013 plus instrumental difficulties after march 2014 post typhoon measurements were less frequent and less regular six observations between late november 2013 and early march 2014 it should be noted that the 24 lai sampling positions differed somewhat between successive dates because they coincided with the positions of the tf gauges which were moved regularly for optimum sampling of spatial variability although the temporal changes in lai obtained in this way will include a spatial effect this is considered to be very minor on three occasions lai was measured at 48 rather than 24 points and the difference between average values for the two groups of 24 data points was insignificant further in an attempt to compensate the lack of field measurements between early march and mid june 2014 a relationship was derived between the previously measured lai values and corresponding values provided by terra modis satellite imagery knyazikhin et al 1999 to obtain approximate monthly changes in lai during april june 2014 y 0 61 x 2 53 where y measured lai and x satellite derived lai r2 0 58 n 13 3 1 3 pre and post disturbance forest inventories two tree inventories were made on the three plots see study site description the first one in may 2013 pre disturbance situation cf table 1 and the second in january 2014 post typhoon damage assessment the three plots were divided into 5 m 5 m sub plots n 74 in which the position and species of all individual trees dbh 5 cm were determined as well as their height clinometer and projected crown area determined from perpendicular measurements of crown width and length no measurements of crown projected area were made during the post disturbance inventory as many trees had lost at least part of their leaves instead four categories of leaf loss were distinguished i less than 25 lost ii 25 50 lost iii 50 75 lost and iv 75 100 lost a fifth category concerned trees whose entire crown had broken off in such cases the height at which the stem was broken as measured from the base of the stem was recorded as well as the distance from the point of breakage to the first major branch further the condition of the leaves was noted e g shredded the proportion of twig loss was assessed using the same categories as for leaf loss the extent of crown damage was estimated further by observing the size and position of the branches that were left on the stem and the diameter of the stem at the point of breakage finally a note was made whether a tree was uprooted or not the degree of damage was also recorded for the trees that were used for the measurement of sf although none of these trees were uprooted during the typhoon hence the number of sampled trees remained constant throughout the study period three of the trees suffered serious damage crown pruning stem breakage cf supplementary table 3 3 2 modelling rainfall interception 3 2 1 the revised analytical interception model because the manual tf gauges overflowed during several large events and were mostly blown over during the passage of typhoon haiyan the revised version of the analytical model of rainfall interception gash et al 1995 was used to model the total interception losses for three periods with contrasting canopy conditions i e i 1 june 7 november 2013 undisturbed ii damaged canopy 8 november 2013 28 february 2014 and iii 1 march 31 may 2014 successively recovering foliage while an adaptation of the analytical model that takes seasonal changes in vegetation lai into account is available van dijk and bruijnzeel 2001 this could not be used because of a lack of lai data for the third period see section 3 1 2 the revised analytical model assumes that rainfall occurs as a series of discrete events defined here as being separated by at least 4 h without rain to allow complete drying of the canopy before the next event see section 3 1 1 each event of sufficient magnitude to fully wet the canopy is sub divided into three phases i a wetting up phase during which p is less than the amount required to fully saturate the canopy p g ii a saturated phase during which rainfall intensity r exceeds the evaporation rate from the wet canopy e and iii a drying phase after all drip from the canopy has ceased gash et al 1995 the amount of water needed to completely saturate the canopy is given by 2 p g r e c s c i n 1 e c r where r denotes the average rainfall intensity falling onto a saturated canopy mm h 1 saturated canopy conditions are generally assumed to occur whenever hourly rainfall exceeds 0 5 mm gash 1979 schellekens et al 1999 s c is the canopy capacity per unit area of cover mm and is obtained by dividing the canopy saturation value s by the dimensionless canopy cover fraction c similarly the wet canopy evaporation rate per unit area of canopy cover e c is derived by dividing the evaporation rate per unit area of ground e by c gash et al 1995 the direct throughfall coefficient p is defined as the proportion of rain that reaches the forest floor directly without hitting the canopy hence c 1 p finally evaporation from tree trunks is specified in terms of trunk storage capacity s t and the proportion of rain diverted to stemflow p t gash 1979 has shown that the slope of a regression equation between observed interception loss and rainfall on an event basis equals e r if it is assumed that both e and r are constant for all storms in this way e and thus e c may be approximated from r when above canopy climatic observations are lacking bruijnzeel and wiersum 1987 dykes 1997 holwerda et al 2012 table 2 summarizes the respective equations used in the revised analytical model to calculate the overall interception loss 3 2 2 derivation of canopy parameters used in the revised analytical model values of p and s for the respective periods with contrasting canopy conditions were estimated using the method of jackson 1975 in this approach the canopy gap fraction p is derived as the slope of the regression equation linking p and tf for storms that are too small to fill the canopy storage conventionally using events with p 1 0 mm only further to obtain the canopy saturation value a line of unit slope is drawn through the highest data points in a graph of event based p versus corresponding net precipitation p net beyond an inflection point that is defined by the intersection of the two regression lines between p and p net for storms that do and those that do not fill the canopy storage jackson 1975 rainfall at the inflection point equals p net s if evaporation losses during canopy wetting are ignored however drawing a line of unit slope through the higher data points to represent events with minimal evaporation losses introduces a certain measure of subjectivity for which this type of approach has been criticized klaassen et al 1998 also neglecting evaporative losses during canopy wetting causes s to be over estimated somewhat by the jackson method therefore klaassen et al 1998 advocated the use of the mean method in which s is determined as the positive intercept with the y axis of a regression between event based rainfall and interception loss the stemflow parameters s t and p t were derived following gash and morton 1978 as the negative intercept and the slope of the linear regression of sf on p respectively 3 3 statistical analysis because of the partial defoliation of the manobo reforest during the passage of typhoon haiyan and the subsequent gradual re foliation of the canopy both of which were hypothesized to have a substantial effect on the forest s capacity to intercept and re evaporate rainfall the one year study period was divided into three periods representing these contrasting canopy conditions i period 1 fully foliated prior to typhoon haiyan 1 june 7 november 2013 ii period 2 heavily defoliated post haiyan 8 november 2013 28 february 2014 and iii period 3 successively recovering foliage 1 march 31 may 2014 the rainfall throughfall and stemflow data were not normally distributed therefore the kruskal wallis test was used to test for differences between median values for the different periods followed by the mann whitney wilcoxon test for pairwise comparisons between groups after applying a bonferoni correction a significance value of p 0 05 was used throughout statgraphic centurion xvii version 17 2 00 software was used for all statistical analyses 4 results 4 1 effect of typhoon haiyan on forest structure and lai interception plot damage inflicted to the trees of the manobo forest by typhoon haiyan was substantial tables 3 and 4 not one of the 82 trees with dbh 5 cm in the interception measurement plot 600 m2 was left undamaged eighteen trees 22 were heavily affected two trees were uprooted seven trees had the upper portion of their crown blown off and nine trees had their top pruned table 3 all trees in the plot experienced some degree of canopy damage 72 of the trees had at least 50 damage while 11 lost their entire crown table 4 damage to the upper plot was even more pronounced due to its more exposed location 80 of the trees sustained damage level 3 or higher i e 50 leaf loss while 28 had their tops pruned and 9 were uprooted table 3 and supplementary fig 1a b the more sheltered lower plot experienced somewhat less damage 58 of trees with damage level 3 or more table 4 pre haiyan lai values varied mostly between 4 0 and 5 9 average lai 5 1 0 65 sd n 12 with the lowest values recorded in the second half of july and late october after several weeks of relatively low rainfall fig 1 a in line with the strong defoliation caused by typhoon haiyan lai measured four weeks after the typhoon on 5 december 2013 was distinctly lower 2 9 0 9 however lai recovered to 4 2 4 5 by late january 2014 i e after ca 10 weeks and to 5 4 by early march despite low rainfall in february fig 1a the latter value is similar to the lai at the start of the observations in june 2013 during times of ample rainfall suggesting more or less full recovery of leaf area in the middle forest plot after about four months the average lai 4 0 0 6 n

recovered leaf surface area period 3 as inferred from remotely sensed values march june 2014 was lower but did not differ significantly from the measured or remotely sensed pre disturbance averages at the 95 confidence interval 4 2 spatio temporal contrasts in lai the temporal variation in lai differed between sub plots within the middle forest plot fig 1b eighteen out of all 24 sub plots were substantially affected by the typhoon four weeks after typhoon passage their lai was more than 33 lower than the respective pre storm averages shaded sub plots in fig 1b the pattern of lai recovery

determined in early march 2014 were lower than those in late january in roughly half of the sub plots nos 15 24 fig 1b possibly reflecting the low rainfall in february cf fig 1a recovery of lai in the lowermost plot was comparable to that in the throughfall measurement site by early march 2014 i e about four months after haiyan but that in the more heavily damaged upper plot was still very limited fig 2 b despite the fact that the latter had higher lai values than the other two plots prior to disturbance fig 2a 4 3 rainfall characteristics total rainfall during the 1 june 2013 31 may 2014 study period was 3337 mm including an estimated maximum wind driven input of 50 mm during passage of typhoon haiyan rainfall totals for the three different periods with contrasting canopy conditions were 1113 mm 1474 mm including the cited wind driven rainfall and 750 mm for the pre disturbance disturbed and recovery periods respectively october 2013 and february and may 2014 were drier than usual whereas june and november 2013 as well as january march and especially april 2014 were wetter than normal fig 3b overall the study year was about 25 wetter than normal the rainfall was delivered in 238 individual events separated by 4 h without rain that occurred on 194 days with a recorded rainfall 0 5 mm each on 106 occasions some of which occurred on the same day as larger events rainfall was 0 5 mm totaling 25 mm median rainfall sizes per event in the respective periods were 4 8 5 9 and 2 8 mm about 57 of all events range 49 71 depending on the period under consideration occurred mostly during the day time between 06 00 h and 18 00 h 37 range 22 45 occurred during the night between 18 00 h and 06 00 h while the remaining 6 7 represented continuous rain throughout the day and night table 5 events were mostly relatively small with 46 60 delivering 5 mm and 84 91 having 30 mm depending on the period under consideration only 2 7 5 and 1 2 5 of events were larger than 50 mm and 100 mm respectively with the largest falls recorded during the wet months following typhoon haiyan period 2 table 5 apart from the 8 november typhoon 203 mm plus an estimated maximum of 50 mm of wind driven rain each of the three periods included one large event all related to the passage of a tropical storm viz 28 29 june 2013 172 mm 10 13 january 2014 190 mm and 22 24 march 2014 220 mm together these four large events delivered at least 785 mm of rain or 24 of the annual total 835 mm and 25 after including the estimated contribution of wind driven rain more than half 54 69 of the rainfall events lasted less than 1 h while 4 13 had a duration longer than 5 h with the greatest occurrence of long duration storms observed during period 2 rainfall intensities were relatively low with as much as 46 57 of events having an intensity of 1 5 mm h 1 and only 1 7 5 having average intensities 20 mm h 1 the absolute maximum 5 min rainfall intensity was 131 mm h 1 overall event based average rainfall intensities for the three periods considered ranged from 6 2 to 7 7 mm h 1 while due to the strongly skewed distribution the median rainfall intensities were 4 5 5 4 mm h 1 table 5 4 4 throughfall stemflow and interception losses before and after forest disturbance data for 68 complete manual tf and sf collections i e no overflowing or fallen over gauges were selected to assess spatial variability during each of the three periods with contrasting canopy conditions table 6 differences in average and median tf p fractions between periods were small and not significant despite the fact that the coefficients of variation cv defined as the standard deviation divided by the mean 100 for the corresponding cumulative tf totals were quite modest at 12 21 table 6 supplementary fig 2 after incorporating the gutter based tf observations for the selected storms the differences became more pronounced between the three groups of data with overall average cumulative tf p fractions of 78 85 and 80 respectively suggesting a 7 rise in tf p after defoliation cf table 8 below the stemflow data were also highly skewed and exhibited large cv values 61 69 but stemflow fractions sf p were small throughout the ratio of cumulative sf to cumulative p for the selected collections decreased slightly after canopy disturbance and defoliation from 2 4 in period 1 to 2 1 in period 2 difference not significant and was even lower after foliar recovery 1 6 in period 3 table 6 inserting event rainfall amounts into the relationships linking event sf to p for the respective periods fig 7a below gave average sf p ratios of 2 7 1 3 and 2 0 for pre haiyan disturbed and recovered conditions respectively with an overall annual value of 1 9 median event based sf p ratios decreased with tree size dbh in an exponential fashion but differences between the relationships for the three periods were not significant fig 4 small trees 5 10 cm dbh and making up 62 of all trees with a dbh 5 cm within the measurement plot were estimated to contribute 54 of the total sf at the plot scale before canopy disturbance based on 55 collections versus 63 in period 2 19 collections corresponding values for large trees dbh 20 cm 15 of all trees were 14 and 11 period 2 respectively and 32 and 26 for medium sized trees dbh 10 20 cm 23 of all trees total amounts of sf mm produced by the small trees were significantly higher compared to those for medium or large trees p 0 05 in each of the three periods n 81 collections pre disturbance median sf volumes normalized for rainfall amount i e stemflow volume ratio svr holwerda et al 2006 for different trees ranged from 0 04 to 0 21 l mm 1 supplementary table 1 with an overall value of 0 08 l mm 1 pre disturbance svr values for individual trees of a given species were comparable e g cananga odorata mahogany but values for similarly sized trees belonging to different species differed considerably e g artocarpus versus voacanga in supplementary table 1 svr values were generally reduced after canopy disturbance and did not fully recover to pre disturbance values during period 3 supplementary table 1 expressed in terms of the dimensionless stemflow funneling ratio i e svr tree basal area herwitz 1986 median values ranged from 1 1 to 35 with lower values usually associated with larger trees supplementary table 2 and supplementary fig 3 funneling ratios generally increased with event size up to ca 25 mm of rain or more in the case of small trees after which values more or less stabilized although variability was large interestingly the relationships broke down completely after forest disturbance or changed their mathematical form in the case of some trees experiencing major structural damage e g tree l4 supplementary fig 3 and supplementary table 3 by definition changes in funneling ratios for a given tree between periods reflected those in svr i e they dropped after canopy defoliation and structural disturbance and recovered to some extent during period 3 for some but not all trees supplementary fig 3 4 5 spatio temporal variations in lai and their effect on relative throughfall amounts average tf p ratios for the three periods more or less mirrored the corresponding changes in lai in an inverse manner cf table 6 and fig 1 similar negative trends were obtained when linking average tf p to average lai per period for the 24 sub plots fig 5 a the relation was steepest and strongest for the pre disturbance period r2 0 61 n 59 collections poor and much less steep for the canopy recovery phase period 3 r2 0 20 n 17 collections and non existent for the period with maximum defoliation period 2 r2 0 02 n 9 collections examining pre disturbance data only and distinguishing between three event size classes p 5 mm 5 20 mm and 20 mm maintained the negative trends with the strongest correlation r2 0 64 n 15 collections and steepest slope for the smallest category differing significantly from the relations for the larger event classes the slopes of the corresponding equations for the other two event categories did not differ significantly from each other but their coefficients of determination declined with increasing event size fig 5b a similar pattern was found when distinguishing between rainfall intensity classes fig 5c thus lai appeared to exert the strongest influence on relative tf amounts and hence relative i prior to canopy disturbance for small p 5 mm and low intensity 1 5 mm h 1 events fig 5b c 4 6 canopy structural parameters as derived from throughfall and stemflow measurements values for the main canopy parameters used in the interception modeling canopy saturation value s direct throughfall coefficient p trunk storage capacity s t and the proportion of rainfall diverted to stemflow p t were derived for the three periods with contrasting canopy conditions from measured p tf and sf for selected storms figs 6 and 7 table 7 summarizes the results for the respective periods along with the corresponding values of the amount of rainfall required to fully wet the canopy p g and average evaporation rates from a saturated canopy e following gash 1979 the canopy saturation value for the manobo forest derived with the jackson method dropped from 0 45 mm for the pre haiyan period period 1 to a low 0 30 mm during the period with the most extensive canopy damage period 2 and recovered somewhat subsequently 0 35 mm fig 6 and table 7 values of s derived with the mean method were identical to those obtained with the jackson method for periods 1 and 3 but slightly lower 0 24 mm for period 2 figs 6 7b and table 7 changes in the direct throughfall coefficient mirrored those for s in that p increased from 0 30 for period 1 to as high as 0 61 during period 2 and 0 42 for period 3 fig 6 and table 7 although sf constituted only a small fraction of incident p regardless of canopy conditions table 6 the regression equations linking sf and p were quite strong fig 7a stemflow coefficients p t ranged from 0 033 for period 1 to 0 015 during period 2 with an intermediate value 0 023 for period 3 correlations between event based interception loss i and p were less strong than those for sf 0 82 0 95 with coefficients of determination ranging from 0 37 period 2 to 0 69 period 3 and 0 70 period 1 fig 7b the slopes of the respective equations i e e r cf gash 1979 varied from 0 14 period 1 to 0 10 period 2 and back to 0 15 period 3 suggesting values of 0 70 0 55 and 0 66 mm h 1 respectively for e using median rather than average rainfall intensities in view of the strong negative skewness of the latter cf table 5 finally combining the values of s c and e c r for the respective periods gave values of ca 0 7 mm for the amount of rainfall required to saturate the canopy eq 2 p g table 7 4 7 model application to estimate period totals of interception loss that included a number of large storms for which tf and sf data were incomplete due to overflowing or disturbed collectors the revised analytical model of rainfall interception was tested against measured i for the data from which the forest structural and other model parameter values listed in table 7 were derived the model overestimated the observed total interception loss for the pre disturbance and recovery periods only slightly by 1 8 and 1 3 respectively with corresponding root mean square errors of 0 83 and 0 97 mm while effectively equaling the observed i for period 2 0 1 rmse 0 49 mm table 8 optimizing the model for e c r to minimize the rmse between modeled and observed i cf schellekens et al 1999 ghimire et al 2017 reproduced observed interception totals for periods 1 and 3 slightly better in terms of relative model error 0 8 and 0 1 respectively but did not reduce the associated rmse values optimizing the value of s did not have any effect on model performance optimizing wet canopy evaporation rate and the canopy saturation value did not improve predictions for the second period either table 8 and fig 8 next the best performing model parameterization was applied to estimate period and annual totals of i using the complete rainfall record overall annual i estimated in this way amounted to 514 mm 15 of p with period values ranging from 18 prior to forest disturbance period 1 to 12 after extensive defoliation period 2 and 17 5 during the successive canopy recovery phase period 3 table 9 the effect of canopy disturbance by typhoon haiyan on annual i was assessed by comparing the previously obtained periodical and annual losses reflecting the changing canopy conditions with that predicted by the model using pre disturbance parameter values throughout 572 mm or 17 of annual p table 9 the model attributed nearly three quarters 73 of the predicted annual i for undisturbed canopy conditions to evaporation from a fully wetted canopy 18 to evaporation after rainfall has ceased drying up phase and 4 by evaporation during small storms losses associated with canopy wetting 2 and evaporation from trunks 3 were equally minor table 9 at 58 mm i e 572 minus 514 mm the inferred reduction in annual interception loss due to the temporary defoliation caused by typhoon haiyan and the subsequent gradual recovery of lai at the middle plot is modest at best equaling only 1 7 of annual p but 10 of i for an undisturbed canopy 4 8 wet canopy evaporation versus rainfall intensity during large storms the data set used for the calibration of the revised analytical model did not include four very large events during which most if not all manual tf collectors overflowed to test whether wet canopy evaporation rates were substantially different during these very large 172 220 mm events hourly tf amounts recorded by the two large gutters during the raining episodes of three of these events excluding typhoon haiyan because of its excessive winds and the disturbing effects these had on the measurement of both p and tf as well as the forest canopy itself were compared with corresponding hourly rainfall totals to derive associated amounts of apparent i all in mm h 1 hourly evaporative losses were positively correlated with rainfall intensity especially for individual events fig 9 maximum values of hourly interception loss inferred in this way were as high as 5 6 mm and therefore far exceeded the period average wet canopy evaporation rates 0 55 0 70 mm h 1 table 7 pertinently the relationship was steeper for the 10 january 2014 event during which time lai was much reduced figs 9 and 1a 5 discussion 5 1 typhoon effects on forest structure although all trees in the three sample plots total area 1850 m2 were affected by typhoon haiyan tables 3 and 4 spatial contrasts in the level of incurred canopy damage reflected clear differences in site exposure damage was more extensive and recovery of lai much slower in the more exposed upper forest plot compared to the more sheltered middle and lower plots table 4 and fig 2b winds in excess of 100 130 km h 1 can damage trees lethally within several hours while wind speeds above ca 60 km h 1 typically cause large scale defoliation scatena et al 2005 maximum wind speeds recorded around the time of the cyclone s landfall in the early morning of 8 november 2013 were as high as 314 km h 1 87 m s 1 rabonza et al 2015 with wind speeds sustained over 10 min of up to 230 km h 1 64 m s 1 nguyen et al 2014 wind speeds experienced by the trees on the ridges and uppermost slopes of the manobo forest are likely to have been equally high generally older and therefore taller and more prominent trees tend to be more vulnerable to crown damage by high wind basnet et al 1992 lin et al 2011 but large trees were effectively lacking at manobo where 85 of the trees had a dbh 20 cm rather in view of the fact that fast growing species of low wood density are more amenable to damage than slower growing later successional species putz 1983 zimmerman et al 1994 the observed high spatial variability in leaf area reduction after typhoon passage fig 1b may reflect a combination of differences in individual tree height affecting local turbulence and crown exposure and wood strength branch breakage however despite the extensive crown damage recorded during the january 2014 survey tables 3 and 4 lai values for the relatively sheltered middle and lower plots reached pre disturbance values again after ca four months 6 march 2014 fig 2 comparable spatial contrasts in forest damage as a function of site exposure have been reported for puerto rico walker 1991 scatena et al 1993 1996 and taiwan lee et al 2008 it has been suggested that planted forests like the manobo reforest may be less well adapted than natural forests and thus suffer greater typhoon hurricane damage e g caribbean pines in nicaragua and fiji boucher et al 1990 waterloo 1994 mahogany in puerto rico basnet et al 1992 however the greater damage to mahogany trees in the puerto rican case was caused in part by the fact that introduced tree species had been preferably planted in moister valley soils that provided less anchoring opportunity basnet et al 1992 similarly typhoon damage to natural broad leaved forest in central taiwan was reported to be greater than that to nearby coniferous plantations due to differences in site exposure lee et al 2008 all exotic mahogany and gmelina trees at manobo were severely damaged by typhoon haiyan and were subsequently felled during a timber salvaging operation with the expected gradual increase in strength of typhoons in general knutson et al 2010 kossin et al 2014 and an intensification of super typhoons in particular due to global warming induced upper oceanic freshening balaguru et al 2016 the structure and development of secondary forests in the cyclone ridden north western tropical pacific de gouvenain and silander 2003 is likely to be affected increasingly by typhoons in the future see lin et al 2011 and yao et al 2015 for a discussion of the ecological consequences despite a slight decrease in the total number of tropical storms crossing the philippines in recent years cinco et al 2016 5 2 forest disturbance effects on interception loss studies of the effects of large scale tropical forest destruction by wind as opposed to gap creation by selective logging asdak et al 1998b chappell et al 2001 on rainfall interception loss are rare long term rainfall and throughfall data for the bisley forest in puerto rico suggested a return to normal tf p ratios within a year after forest wreckage by hurricane hugo scatena et al 1996 while heartsill scalley et al 2007 reported further enhanced but unquantified tf p ratios for the seven week period after passage of hurricanes bertha 1996 and georges 1998 at bisley compared to the preceding seven week period neither study attempted to separate the strong seasonal variation in tf p for the bisley forest schellekens et al 1999 from that incurred by actual storm damage so that the overall effect on annual interception loss remains unknown waterloo 1994 estimated i from two pinus caribaea plantations in fiji before and after they were struck by cyclone sina in november 1990 there was a major reduction in wet season i for the younger of the two plantations from 22 in 1990 to 11 shortly after the storm in 1991 but values for pre and post cyclone dry season i were already similar 2 higher in 1991 after seven months of re foliation pre and post storm differences for an older stand were less pronounced 3 4 reduction in i and possibly reflected a smaller reduction in lai waterloo 1994 this reduction in interception loss is similar to the typhoon induced change in annual i estimated for the manobo reforest 1 7 of annual p table9 although the absolute difference is larger because of the much higher rainfall in the philippines neal et al 1993 also found a 4 decrease in i p for a mature beech forest in the southern u k during the first year after it was hit by a major storm summarizing the effect of major canopy disturbance by high winds on rainfall interception loss appears to be both temporary 4 12 months and comparatively modest 4 of annual p although it remains to be seen what the cumulative effects will be of more intensive or more frequent disturbances in future cf cinco et al 2016 lin et al 2011 yao et al 2015 it is of interest to compare these wind induced disturbance effects with the impact of seasonal changes in lai on interception loss i e defoliation but no added gap creation and that of selective logging gap creation only tanaka et al 2015 did not find any difference in tf p ratios for mature teak plantations in thailand during the leafless and leafed states rainfall amount was the only variable explaining tf during the growing season while temperature maximum wind speed and rainfall intensity were also influential during the leafless dry season in a companion study on the effects of climatic and canopy conditions on sf production by teak trees tanaka et al 2017 reported increased sf p ratios during the leafless state for five out of nine sampled trees no significant change in three others and a reduction in the one remaining sample tree interestingly the trees exhibiting an increase in sf p did not experience shading by neighbouring crowns in the leafed state whereas the other trees did despite considerable variability between individual trees the median stemflow funneling ratio increased during the leafless season tanaka et al 2017 chen and li 2016 did not find any difference in wet and dry season i from a sub tropical forest in taiwan despite major contrasts in seasonal lai 52 drop in the dry season although the tf p ratio increased somewhat during the dry season this was compensated by an equal reduction in sf p pertinently while evaporation from a wetted canopy was the dominant interception component throughout the year the ratio between the latter and the amount contributed by the drying up phase more than tripled 1 4 versus 4 9 in the dry season this marked shift reflected both a lower dry season canopy saturation value s causing smaller losses during canopy drying and a much lower average dry season rainfall intensity 2 8 versus 5 8 mm h 1 chen and li 2016 cf gash et al 1995 at manobo where median rainfall intensities were effectively similar between periods table 5 the reduction in s following the passage of typhoon haiyan from 0 45 mm to 0 24 0 30 mm table 7 also caused a reduction in the inferred contribution of canopy drying to total i from 22 to 10 predicted evaporation from the saturated canopy increased from 68 prior to forest disturbance to 84 after typhoon haiyan table 9 implying an upward shift in the ratio between the two interception components from 3 1 to 8 4 in agreement with the findings of chen and li 2016 for natural forest in taiwan but unlike the results obtained by tanaka et al 2017 for teak plantations in thailand stemflow at manobo both in terms of sf p ratios and funneling ratios decreased after defoliation by typhoon haiyan and recuperated somewhat after the lai increased again in period 3 fig 7b and supplementary fig 3 however sf production is the result of complex interactions between both spatio temporal variations in tree architecture and a range of climatic factors tanaka et al 2017 thus simple comparisons between leafed and leafless states are unlikely to provide the full answer just like predictive approaches based on tree characteristics do not get very far especially not in species rich tropical forests zimmermann et al 2015 one might expect gap creation during logging to increase the aerodynamic conductance g a due to the associated increase in canopy surface unevenness thereby enhancing turbulent exchange and thus evaporative losses during and immediately after rainfall instead asdak et al 1998a reported a marked decrease in g a and i p upon opening a rain forest canopy in kalimantan similar decreases in g a were derived by deguchi et al 2006 for the leafless phase of a warm temperate deciduous forest in japan and by teklehaimanot et al 1991 for a series of temperate coniferous plantations of progressively lower stocking none of these studies provided a physical explanation for the reduction in g a but it is likely that defoliation and opening of the canopy by logging or thinning also leads to deeper ventilation i e a lowering of the displacement and roughness lengths d and z 0 and thus to a lower g a thom 1975 however as stated by asdak et al 1998a and indicated by our modeling table 9 the observed reductions in i p after canopy opening or defoliation reflect both changes in wet canopy evaporation rates and reduced canopy saturation values cf table 7 5 3 effects of canopy heterogeneity on throughfall relative throughfall amounts tf p in the manobo forest were inversely related to canopy density as represented by measurements of lai above individual tf collectors under undisturbed canopy conditions r2 0 61 fig 5a corresponding relations for the two post typhoon periods were less steep and not significant fig 5a as such lai alone is a rather poor predictor of on site tf p as also reported for mature rain forests in ecuador r2 0 12 fleischbein et al 2005 puerto rico r2 0 12 0 21 holwerda 2005 and indonesia r2 0 02 dietz et al 2006 as well as for tree plantations in panamá park and cameron 2008 in addition results become poorer as rainfall event size or intensity increased fig 5b c possibly because of the larger variability in event sizes involved with increasing rainfall compared to the relatively small variation in tf p cf holwerda 2005 somewhat better results were obtained when using a measure of canopy openness instead of lai fleischbein et al 2005 or using canopy depth and openness as added variables park and cameron 2008 cf dietz et al 2006 however the strong dependency of such relations on rainfall amount or intensity fig 5b c already indicates that forest structural parameters alone have limited predictive capacity in this regard in addition many of these structural parameters are correlated with one another rendering the use of multiple regression approaches problematic zimmermann et al 2013 in a particularly stringent study involving multiple stands of different ages and characteristics under similar climatic conditions zimmermann et al 2013 concluded that the best tf p predictor was the basal area fraction contributed by small trees r2 0 72 5 4 interception loss from regenerating tropical forests the manobo reforest in perspective despite the modest age and stature of the manobo reforest 23 years and 7 3 m tall at the start of the interception measurements both the observed cumulative pre haiyan interception loss for selected storms 18 table 8 and the modeled annual i for undisturbed canopy conditions 17 table 9 are in the upper part of the range of values derived for old growth lowland evergreen rain forests in south east asia 8 22 as well as those for most regenerating forests 3 21 table 10 although results obtained for different forests reflect differences in canopy density and local rainfall intensities for a given forest type there appears to be a distinct trend towards lower i p values for studies employing a larger number of tf collectors e g old growth lowland forests in table 10 such findings are usually interpreted in terms of the ability of the sampling design to adequately include drip points i e points of locally enhanced tf p ratios lloyd and de marques filho 1988 manfroi et al 2006 yet it would be premature to attribute the relatively high i p value derived for the manobo reforest to inadequate sampling on top of the 24 roving tf gauges two large gutters were used which effectively doubled the sampling area to the equivalent of 48 gauges also with coefficients of variation cv for our mean manually obtained tf estimates ranging from 11 5 period 1 to 21 period 3 throughfall variability at manobo table 6 cf supplementary fig 2 was much less than that observed for more biodiverse mature rain forests in central kalimantan 36 for 18 roving gauges vernimmen et al 2007 panamá 49 for 30 fixed gauges macinnis ng et al 2012 and puerto rico 23 for 30 roving gauges holwerda et al 2006 rather our cumulative cvs were comparable to the 15 24 reported for lowland rain forest after some selective logging in north east borneo and using a very large number of fixed tf samplers n 80 chappell et al 2001 while the interception results for regenerating tropical forests collated in table 10 vary widely as a result of differences in canopy characteristics sampling design and rainfall regime e g length of dry season rainfall intensity and duration certain broad patterns do arise first i p for very young 1 5 yr regrowth is generally enhanced the most relative to i p in old growth lowland rain forest while differences between primary and secondary forest during the next five years of succession or later are already hard to discern the comparative short term work by zimmermann et al 2013 in 16 forest stands in panamá that ranged between 3 and 30 years of age provides further confirmation that tf p ratios for forests older than 10 years may not be statistically distinguishable from those for nearby old growth forest however the range reported for their seven 5 7 year old forests was considerable 87 3 101 6 of p secondly stemflow is often much higher in young forests up to 10 years of age with an exceptionally high value recorded for 10 year old regrowth dominated by the banana like phenakospermum hölscher et al 1998 overall there is a dearth of systematic studies in 5 15 year old forests that include sf as well as tf measurements over an entire seasonal cycle changes in forest structure notably lai tree density and height are especially pronounced during the first decade of regrowth zimmermann et al 2013 scatena et al 1996 and this is reflected in rapid changes in relative amounts of tf and especially sf during this phase table 10 furthermore most studies to date may well have under estimated sf by not including the stemflow contributions by very small trees and saplings whose funneling ratios are typically high manfroi et al 2004 honda et al 2014 gonzález martínez et al 2017 this would seem all the more important for young forests where smaller trees are likely more abundant zimmermann et al 2013 chazdon 2014 cf supplementary fig 1 5 5 wet canopy evaporation rates versus rainfall intensity for the two periods having more or less fully developed foliage i e periods 1 and 3 tf based wet canopy evaporation rates at manobo e tf 0 66 0 70 mm h 1 table 7 were much higher than e pm values reported for lowland rain forests elsewhere in the region having similar rainfall amounts and intensities 0 06 0 24 mm h 1 wallace and mcjannet 2006 vernimmen et al 2007 our pre disturbance e tf falls in the range of values derived for other south east asian lowland rain forests and tree plantations 0 5 0 8 mm h 1 asdak et al 1998a dykes 1997 vernimmen et al 2007 waterloo 1994 similar discrepancies between e pm and e tf have been reported for many forests and may be attributable to various factors recently reviewed by van dijk et al 2015 particularly the underestimation of aerodynamic conductance to moisture exchange between the vegetation and the overlying air g a holwerda et al 2012 unaccounted horizontal advection of warmer and drier air from nearby areas without rain stewart 1977 asdak et al 1998a cisneros vaca et al 2018 release of thermal energy stored in the ecosystem itself especially at the beginning of a storm michiles dos and gielow 2008 cisneros vaca et al 2018 and possibly larger scale advection of sensible heat from the ocean in specific settings shuttleworth and calder 1979 blyth et al 1994 given the modest stature of the manobo reforest release of stored thermal energy is less likely to be important but being situated within 2 km from the pacific ocean lateral transfer of sensible heat from the warm ocean waters off the coast of leyte cannot be ruled out especially at night when air temperatures drop below those of seawater typically 27 29 c according to roberts et al 2005 a horizontal temperature gradient of 3 4 k per 100 m would be sufficient to sustain a wet canopy evaporation rate of 0 5 mm h 1 roughly the difference between e tf and e pm at manobo night time minimum air temperatures measured at the basper grassland site 3 5 km from manobo were around 26 2 c throughout the year and therefore generally not low enough to reach a 3 4 k difference in temperature between land and sea further drops in air temperature during rainfall were generally small 1 5 c on average but occasionally up to 6 c this suggests substantial downward from the air rather than lateral from the ocean transfer of sensible heat to maintain the observed high values of e tf cf stewart 1977 blyth et al 1994 cisneros vaca et al 2018 indeed holwerda et al 2012 drew attention to the fact that on average values of e tf derived for eight oceanic tropical sites were not enhanced relative to five more continental sites as had been suggested previously shuttleworth and calder 1979 schellekens et al 1999 rather values of e tf tended to be enhanced within each group at sites located in dissected or mountainous terrain as opposed to sites situated in less complex terrain suggesting aerodynamic roughness at the landscape scale to be a key factor although holwerda et al 2012 admitted that a larger comparative data set would be needed to draw firmer conclusions no measurements of g a are available for the study forest but the manobo ridge is the first topographic rise encountered by moist winds coming from the ocean suggesting potentially enhanced turbulence and vapour exchange between the forest canopy and the air holwerda et al 2012 hourly wet canopy evaporation rates e tf during large and extended storms at manobo showed a strong and positive relation to hourly rainfall intensity r fig 9 murakami 2006 found the same phenomenon in a coastal warm temperate forest in japan and suggested that this could be caused by enhanced evaporation of fine splash droplets created when high energy raindrops hit the canopy during intense rainfall as pointed out by dunkerley 2009 dunin et al 1988 had earlier suggested an effectively similar mechanism adding that turnover of water vapour generated in this way may be accelerated with increasing rainfall intensity due to an associated increase in the frequency and turbulent intensity of downdrafts splash impact droplets are produced in large numbers above a threshold r of about 3 4 mm h 1 dunkerley 2009 with a doubling of impact velocity causing a ten fold increase in the number of splash droplets stow and stainer 1977 rainfall intensities at manobo exceed 5 mm h 1 i e well above the cited 3 4 mm h 1 threshold for about half the time that it rains table 5 cf zhang et al 2018a suggesting a distinct possibility of splash impact droplet generation as well as intensified downdrafts and thus canopy ventilation interestingly the relationship between hourly e and r at high intensities was steeper for the storm sampled on 10 january 2014 when lai was low after defoliation by typhoon haiyan figs 9 and 1a since opening of the canopy reduces both g a and the canopy saturation value s see section 5 1 the observed steepening of the relationship following defoliation also reported by waterloo 1994 but attributed by him to drier post cyclone conditions cf tanaka et al 2015 might reflect enhanced production of splash droplets by rain hitting the now exposed branches as well as enhanced ventilation deguchi et al 2006 further work could focus on droplet spectra generated on foliated versus defoliated canopies subject to comparable rainfall intensities and on the effect of high rainfall intensity on added ventilation and mixing of air within the canopy dunkerley 2009 van dijk et al 2015 cf dunin et al 1988 nevertheless regardless of the actual mechanism involved high rates of e will require sufficient amounts of additional sensible heat as such there is a distinct need for more information on the changes in temperature and humidity with height above forest

manobo leyte island philippines the forest was hit by super typhoon haiyan in november 2013 which caused extensive defoliation and canopy damage nevertheless leaf area index lai at relatively sheltered mid and foot slope locations recovered more or less to pre disturbance values after ca 4 months rainfall partitioning was analyzed separately therefore for three periods with contrasting canopy conditions viz i pre disturbance ii maximum defoliation and iii largely recovered foliage stemflow made up a small percentage of incident p with weighted mean sf p ratios of 2 7 1 3 and 2 0 for the respective periods and an overall mean of 2 small trees 5 10 cm diameter contributed 54 pre haiyan to 63 post haiyan of all stemflow weighted mean throughfall as measured by 24 roving collectors and two large fixed recording gutters for the above data set varied from 78 of incident precipitation before canopy disturbance to 85 during the period with the most extensive defoliation and 80 after initial foliage recovery the manually collected tf data exhibited modest cumulative coefficients of variation compared to values reported for several more species rich old growth rain forests pre typhoon disturbance values of rainfall interception loss i for the semi mature manobo reforest fall in the upper part of the range reported for old growth lowland rain forests in south east asia the effect of canopy disturbance on annual i at the relatively sheltered mid slope measurement site was assessed through modeling and appeared to be modest 2 of p on an annual basis although it remains to be seen what the effects would be of repeated and more frequent disturbances of similar magnitude events in future as a result of climatic intensification cf balaguru et al 2016 relative amounts of tf at manobo were inversely related to lai during conditions of full foliage but the relation broke down upon canopy disturbance moreover the relationships were strongest for small storms 5 mm and low rainfall intensities 5 mm h 1 hourly wet canopy evaporation rates during large and extensive rainfall events were strongly correlated with hourly rainfall intensities and far exceeded values sustained by available radiation although horizontal advection of sensible heat from the nearby ocean cannot be excluded such high evaporation rates are most likely caused by downward advection of sensible heat from the overlying atmosphere in addition high rainfall intensities at manobo may generate a large number of splash droplets that are more amenable to rapid evaporation acknowledgements we are

6840,typhoon haiyan made landfall in the central philippines on 8 november 2013 as one of the strongest tropical cyclones ever it also affected a 23 year old multi species reforest at manobo near tacloban city on leyte island as part of a larger hydrological investigation of the impacts of reforestation on streamflow response in the tacloban area gross rainfall p throughfall tf 24 roving collectors and stemflow sf 12 trees were monitored at manobo between june 2013 and may 2014 leaf area index lai above each tf collector was measured regularly total rainfall interception losses i were determined using gash s revised analytical model for three consecutive periods i pre haiyan baseline ii post haiyan damaged canopy and iii after initial canopy recovery modeled i was 18 of p before disturbance 12 for the period with the most extensive canopy damage and 17 5 after initial canopy recovery stemflow was low and weighted mean values accounted for 2 7 1 3 and 2 0 of p for the respective periods contrasts in period average values of i reflected changes in lai as well as wet canopy evaporation rates storm based tf fractions at the 5 m 5 m sub plot scale were inversely related to lai especially for small storms and low rainfall intensities inferred hourly rates of wet canopy evaporation showed a strong positive relationship to hourly rainfall intensity during large storms the revised analytical model was also run using pre disturbance parameter values for the entire year to assess the overall effect of canopy damage on i estimated annual losses with and without canopy disturbance were 514 mm 15 of p and 572 mm 17 respectively thus observed and inferred changes in rainfall partitioning after canopy disturbance and initial recovery were comparatively modest likely because the measurement site was relatively sheltered from the winds during typhoon passage and re foliation relatively rapid however given the predicted increase in occurrence of super typhoons due to continued global warming and oceanic freshening the structure of forests in affected regions can be expected to be modified with potential consequences for rainfall partitioning and hydrological response keywords leaf area index leyte island reforestation stemflow throughfall wet canopy evaporation 1 introduction the natural succession of the vegetation in humid tropical areas subject to intensifying slash and burn cultivation is often arrested by repeated fire and so called fire climax grasslands tend to form instead garrity et al 1997 hooper et al 2005 styger et al 2007 soils associated with these imperata and saccharum dominated grasslands can be physically and chemically degraded rendering them relatively unproductive ohta 1990 santoso et al 1997 and prone to overland flow generation chandler and walter 1998 zhang et al 2018a b and surface erosion especially when grazed concepcion and samar 1995 snelder 2001 ziegler et al 2009 in response to these problems fire climax grasslands across the tropics are being targeted increasingly for conversion to more productive and environmentally favourable forms of land use such as reforestation and agroforestry otsamo et al 1997 murniati 2002 wishnie et al 2007 snelder and lasco 2008 ancog et al 2016 although the harsh environmental conditions and recurring fires typically associated with these grasslands tend to preclude the natural re establishment of forest the grasses can be shaded out by planting fast growing tree species in combination with intensive initial site management otsamo 2000 murniati 2002 the associated improvements in below canopy micro climatic conditions reduce the competitive ability of the grasses and promote the germination and development of native tree seedlings resulting in mixed stands with the planted usually exotic species dominating the main canopy and naturally regenerating native species being dominant in the understory lamb 1998 otsamo 2000 cf wills et al 2016 thus although upon maturation the resulting forest neither classifies as a pure plantation nor as fully naturally developed secondary forest a multi species ecosystem is created that may be appropriately called a reforest chazdon et al 2016 secondary forests and reforests in various stages of growth constitute the dominant forest type nowadays in many humid tropical regions fao 2010

dry season flows are occasionally reported zhou et al 2010 krishnaswamy et al 2012 cf scott et al 2005 as part of an investigation into a similar claim that formerly ephemeral streamflow became perennial about seven to eight years after reforesting cogon grassland in north eastern leyte island the philippines u padecio personal communication we measured rainfall interception losses i between june 2013 and may 2014 in the 23 year old community managed manobo reforest near tacloban city values of i for semi mature 10 25 years old secondary tropical forests are often already indistinguishable from those reported for old growth forests e g hölscher et al 1998 macinnis ng et al 2012 zimmermann et al 2013 moreover average i from tropical forests subject to maritime climatic conditions like those prevailing in the philippines tends to be roughly twice that inferred for forests at mid continental locations roberts et al 2005 wallace and mcjannet 2008 while the reasons for this contrast are debated in terms of the exact mechanisms involved and the sources of the non radiant energy required to sustain such high rates of evaporation see discussion in holwerda et al 2012 and van dijk et al 2015 the impact of the high i observed for maritime tropical forests on the overall water budget is potentially large mcjannet et al 2007 cf roberts et al 2005 the philippine region

stemflow sf both in mm collection over the one year study period 1 june 2013 31 may 2014 gross rainfall was measured in an agricultural patch just east of the manobo forest at an elevation of 40 m a s l as well as on the upper ridge of the study catchment at 220 m a s l using a tipping bucket rain gauge rg3 onset computer corporation usa connected to a hobo pendant event data logger the resolution of the rainfall recorders was 0 25 mm per tip confirmed by manual calibration single tips making up 0 85 of the annual total were not included in the evaluation of rainfall characteristics because of the unknown duration of rainfall they represented events were separated by a rainless period of at least 4 h to allow full drying of the canopy schellekens et al 1999 dietz et al 2006 the orifices of the two recording rain gauges were placed at 1 m above ground level to avoid ground splash effects generally the average of the amount recorded by the upper and lower tipping bucket gauges was used as the rainfall input for the interception measurement plot which was situated at an intermediate elevation of 110 m a s l occasional gaps in the record of either gauge were filled using corresponding data for the other recording gauge as the respective rainfall amounts were strongly correlated p upper 0 91 p lower r2 0 975 no correction was made for wind speeds which were generally low 1 9 m s 1 on average at tacloban airport and 1 7 m s 1 at an exposed hilltop in the nearby 3 5 km basper grassland catchment not even during typhoon haiyan because potential corrections at such extreme wind speeds would lead to very high but unverifiable rainfall inputs cf førland et al 1996 instead it was assumed that the amount of rainfall measured at a relatively sheltered valley bottom site in the basper grassland during typhoon haiyan was representative for the rainfall at the study forest in addition the catch of a recording cylindrical fog gauge located next to the anemometer at the basper hilltop and having a 100 catch efficiency for near horizontal wind driven rain frumau et al 2011 was used to estimate the extra inputs of wind driven rain during the haiyan event because this type of passive fog gauge has a higher catch efficiency than does a live vegetation canopy bruijnzeel et al 2005 the resulting catch must be considered to represent a maximum value a standard manual rain gauge 100 cm2 orifice was placed next to the lower recording gauge as a check event rainfall totals for each gauge type did not differ significantly and were strongly correlated plower 1 01pstandard r2 0 98 in addition a manual collector of the same type as used for the tf measurements see below for description was placed next to the lower recording gauge again measurements for the two types of gauges were strongly correlated y 1 05x where y manual gauge and x recording gauge r2 0 99 before typhoon haiyan the manual rainfall and tf gauges were generally emptied after each significant event i e on the same day or the next however after the passage of typhoon haiyan on 8 november 2013 the trail to access the interception measurement site was blocked by numerous fallen trees and branches and the sampling frequency was decreased to once a week or occasionally longer until late february 2014 from early march onwards until the end of the study period measurements were typically taken every five days the continuous records of p and tf gutters were used to identify single storms during such intervals throughfall tf was measured in the 10 m 60 m mid elevation plot cf supplementary fig 1c one tf gauge was assigned to each of 24 i e two parallel rows of 12 sub plots 5 m 5 m each and moved to a new random location within the sub plot after being emptied for optimal sampling of so called drip points where tf tends to concentrate as a result of tree architecture lloyd and de marques filho 1988 holwerda et al 2006 each tf gauge consisted of an 18 litre collector with a 25 cm diameter funnel a metal wire mesh 1 cm 1 cm grid was placed inside the funnel to minimize coarse organic debris entering the sample whereas a ping pong ball was placed in the centre of the funnel to minimize evaporative losses the collectors were stabilized by placing them inside a metal holder equipped with pins that were pushed into the soil measured tf volumes were converted to equivalent water depth in mm by dividing the volume of water in each gauge by the funnel area 491 cm2 next the regression equation linking the catch of the manual tf type gauge placed in the clearing next to the lower recording rain gauge was used to correct the amounts of tf collected by the funnel type gauges in addition tf was measured continuously using two fixed v shaped stainless steel gutters 200 cm 30 cm 15 cm each the gutters were placed at ca 1 m above the forest floor to avoid splash in from the ground and at an angle of 10 to the horizontal to encourage rapid drainage losses by splash from the gutter system were minimized by the v shaped nature of the sides of the gutter each gutter was equipped with a tipping bucket 50 ml per tip confirmed by manual calibration up to intensities of 2 5 mm min 1 plus a data logger hobo pendant event logger onset computer corporation usa the drainage slot at the end of each gutter was covered by a metal mesh to minimize entry of organic debris the collecting surface of the gutters was cleaned regularly tf volumes measured by the gutters were similarly converted to equivalent water depths in mm by dividing water volumes by gutter area corrected for gutter inclination the catch of the two gutters was strongly correlated both before r2 0 76 and especially after typhoon passage r2 0 96 1 00 depending on the period considered and the respective equations were used for occasional gap filling finally the amounts of tf collected by the recording gutters and the funnel type gauges were averaged using a weighting procedure that took the relative surface areas of the two types of gauges into account cf ghimire et al 2017 stemflow sf was measured for 12 trees which were selected on the basis of three dbh categories four trees per category small dbh 5 10 cm intermediate dbh 10 20 cm and large dbh 20 cm each tree was equipped with a 25 mm small trees or 64 mm large and intermediate trees diameter plastic hose slit open along its length and fastened tightly in a spiral fashion around the tree trunk using nails and silicon sealant each collar ended in a 22 litre container stemflow volumes were measured at the same time as tf to scale up to the plot level sf was converted to unit ground area mm for a given tree category by dividing the total volume in litres generated by all trees of that diameter class present within the plot by the plot area 520 m2 corrected for slope inclination total sf generated by all trees dbh 5 cm within the plot was derived as 1 sf s f small a s f medium b s f large c a where sfsmall sfmedium and sflarge are the average volumes of stemflow for the respective tree size classes per event in litres a is the plot area m2 corrected for the average ground slope of 30 and a b and c denote the number of small medium and large trees present in the interception measurement plot 51 19 and 12 respectively it is recognized that the amounts of sf obtained with eq 1 may represent an under estimate because stemflow was not measured on trees and saplings with a dbh 5 cm although sf volumes associated with these small trees and saplings are generally small on a per tree basis their contribution to overall plot scale sf can be significant in forests where they occur in large numbers manfroi et al 2004 gonzález martínez et al 2017 the density of trees and saplings with dbh 5 cm at manobo was not quantified hence the possible degree of under estimation of plot scale sf by the exclusion of contributions by very small trees cannot be determined although the overall absolute effect is likely to be limited 3 1 2 leaf area index to explore how changes in canopy density might affect rainfall interception loss cf fleischbein et al 2005 lai was measured during overcast conditions on 12 occasions between early june and late october 2013 at intervals of 1 3 weeks at 24 positions within the middle 600 m2 interception study plot using a cid bio science ci 110 plant canopy imager cf supplementary fig 1d no corrections were applied to account for the effect of the measurements being conducted on a fairly steep slope as the main focus was placed on relative differences in lai and the associated over estimation was expected to be systematic and more or less constant lin et al 2011 due to the difficulty of access associated with the infrastructural havoc brought about by typhoon haiyan in the tacloban area in november 2013 plus instrumental difficulties after march 2014 post typhoon measurements were less frequent and less regular six observations between late november 2013 and early march 2014 it should be noted that the 24 lai sampling positions differed somewhat between successive dates because they coincided with the positions of the tf gauges which were moved regularly for optimum sampling of spatial variability although the temporal changes in lai obtained in this way will include a spatial effect this is considered to be very minor on three occasions lai was measured at 48 rather than 24 points and the difference between average values for the two groups of 24 data points was insignificant further in an attempt to compensate the lack of field measurements between early march and mid june 2014 a relationship was derived between the previously measured lai values and corresponding values provided by terra modis satellite imagery knyazikhin et al 1999 to obtain approximate monthly changes in lai during april june 2014 y 0 61 x 2 53 where y measured lai and x satellite derived lai r2 0 58 n 13 3 1 3 pre and post disturbance forest inventories two tree inventories were made on the three plots see study site description the first one in may 2013 pre disturbance situation cf table 1 and the second in january 2014 post typhoon damage assessment the three plots were divided into 5 m 5 m sub plots n 74 in which the position and species of all individual trees dbh 5 cm were determined as well as their height clinometer and projected crown area determined from perpendicular measurements of crown width and length no measurements of crown projected area were made during the post disturbance inventory as many trees had lost at least part of their leaves instead four categories of leaf loss were distinguished i less than 25 lost ii 25 50 lost iii 50 75 lost and iv 75 100 lost a fifth category concerned trees whose entire crown had broken off in such cases the height at which the stem was broken as measured from the base of the stem was recorded as well as the distance from the point of breakage to the first major branch further the condition of the leaves was noted e g shredded the proportion of twig loss was assessed using the same categories as for leaf loss the extent of crown damage was estimated further by observing the size and position of the branches that were left on the stem and the diameter of the stem at the point of breakage finally a note was made whether a tree was uprooted or not the degree of damage was also recorded for the trees that were used for the measurement of sf although none of these trees were uprooted during the typhoon hence the number of sampled trees remained constant throughout the study period three of the trees suffered serious damage crown pruning stem breakage cf supplementary table 3 3 2 modelling rainfall interception 3 2 1 the revised analytical interception model because the manual tf gauges overflowed during several large events and were mostly blown over during the passage of typhoon haiyan the revised version of the analytical model of rainfall interception gash et al 1995 was used to model the total interception losses for three periods with contrasting canopy conditions i e i 1 june 7 november 2013 undisturbed ii damaged canopy 8 november 2013 28 february 2014 and iii 1 march 31 may 2014 successively recovering foliage while an adaptation of the analytical model that takes seasonal changes in vegetation lai into account is available van dijk and bruijnzeel 2001 this could not be used because of a lack of lai data for the third period see section 3 1 2 the revised analytical model assumes that rainfall occurs as a series of discrete events defined here as being separated by at least 4 h without rain to allow complete drying of the canopy before the next event see section 3 1 1 each event of sufficient magnitude to fully wet the canopy is sub divided into three phases i a wetting up phase during which p is less than the amount required to fully saturate the canopy p g ii a saturated phase during which rainfall intensity r exceeds the evaporation rate from the wet canopy e and iii a drying phase after all drip from the canopy has ceased gash et al 1995 the amount of water needed to completely saturate the canopy is given by 2 p g r e c s c i n 1 e c r where r denotes the average rainfall intensity falling onto a saturated canopy mm h 1 saturated canopy conditions are generally assumed to occur whenever hourly rainfall exceeds 0 5 mm gash 1979 schellekens et al 1999 s c is the canopy capacity per unit area of cover mm and is obtained by dividing the canopy saturation value s by the dimensionless canopy cover fraction c similarly the wet canopy evaporation rate per unit area of canopy cover e c is derived by dividing the evaporation rate per unit area of ground e by c gash et al 1995 the direct throughfall coefficient p is defined as the proportion of rain that reaches the forest floor directly without hitting the canopy hence c 1 p finally evaporation from tree trunks is specified in terms of trunk storage capacity s t and the proportion of rain diverted to stemflow p t gash 1979 has shown that the slope of a regression equation between observed interception loss and rainfall on an event basis equals e r if it is assumed that both e and r are constant for all storms in this way e and thus e c may be approximated from r when above canopy climatic observations are lacking bruijnzeel and wiersum 1987 dykes 1997 holwerda et al 2012 table 2 summarizes the respective equations used in the revised analytical model to calculate the overall interception loss 3 2 2 derivation of canopy parameters used in the revised analytical model values of p and s for the respective periods with contrasting canopy conditions were estimated using the method of jackson 1975 in this approach the canopy gap fraction p is derived as the slope of the regression equation linking p and tf for storms that are too small to fill the canopy storage conventionally using events with p 1 0 mm only further to obtain the canopy saturation value a line of unit slope is drawn through the highest data points in a graph of event based p versus corresponding net precipitation p net beyond an inflection point that is defined by the intersection of the two regression lines between p and p net for storms that do and those that do not fill the canopy storage jackson 1975 rainfall at the inflection point equals p net s if evaporation losses during canopy wetting are ignored however drawing a line of unit slope through the higher data points to represent events with minimal evaporation losses introduces a certain measure of subjectivity for which this type of approach has been criticized klaassen et al 1998 also neglecting evaporative losses during canopy wetting causes s to be over estimated somewhat by the jackson method therefore klaassen et al 1998 advocated the use of the mean method in which s is determined as the positive intercept with the y axis of a regression between event based rainfall and interception loss the stemflow parameters s t and p t were derived following gash and morton 1978 as the negative intercept and the slope of the linear regression of sf on p respectively 3 3 statistical analysis because of the partial defoliation of the manobo reforest during the passage of typhoon haiyan and the subsequent gradual re foliation of the canopy both of which were hypothesized to have a substantial effect on the forest s capacity to intercept and re evaporate rainfall the one year study period was divided into three periods representing these contrasting canopy conditions i period 1 fully foliated prior to typhoon haiyan 1 june 7 november 2013 ii period 2 heavily defoliated post haiyan 8 november 2013 28 february 2014 and iii period 3 successively recovering foliage 1 march 31 may 2014 the rainfall throughfall and stemflow data were not normally distributed therefore the kruskal wallis test was used to test for differences between median values for the different periods followed by the mann whitney wilcoxon test for pairwise comparisons between groups after applying a bonferoni correction a significance value of p 0 05 was used throughout statgraphic centurion xvii version 17 2 00 software was used for all statistical analyses 4 results 4 1 effect of typhoon haiyan on forest structure and lai interception plot damage inflicted to the trees of the manobo forest by typhoon haiyan was substantial tables 3 and 4 not one of the 82 trees with dbh 5 cm in the interception measurement plot 600 m2 was left undamaged eighteen trees 22 were heavily affected two trees were uprooted seven trees had the upper portion of their crown blown off and nine trees had their top pruned table 3 all trees in the plot experienced some degree of canopy damage 72 of the trees had at least 50 damage while 11 lost their entire crown table 4 damage to the upper plot was even more pronounced due to its more exposed location 80 of the trees sustained damage level 3 or higher i e 50 leaf loss while 28 had their tops pruned and 9 were uprooted table 3 and supplementary fig 1a b the more sheltered lower plot experienced somewhat less damage 58 of trees with damage level 3 or more table 4 pre haiyan lai values varied mostly between 4 0 and 5 9 average lai 5 1 0 65 sd n 12 with the lowest values recorded in the second half of july and late october after several weeks of relatively low rainfall fig 1 a in line with the strong defoliation caused by typhoon haiyan lai measured four weeks after the typhoon on 5 december 2013 was distinctly lower 2 9 0 9 however lai recovered to 4 2 4 5 by late january 2014 i e after ca 10 weeks and to 5 4 by early march despite low rainfall in february fig 1a the latter value is similar to the lai at the start of the observations in june 2013 during times of ample rainfall suggesting more or less full recovery of leaf area in the middle forest plot after about four months the average lai 4 0 0 6 n

recovered leaf surface area period 3 as inferred from remotely sensed values march june 2014 was lower but did not differ significantly from the measured or remotely sensed pre disturbance averages at the 95 confidence interval 4 2 spatio temporal contrasts in lai the temporal variation in lai differed between sub plots within the middle forest plot fig 1b eighteen out of all 24 sub plots were substantially affected by the typhoon four weeks after typhoon passage their lai was more than 33 lower than the respective pre storm averages shaded sub plots in fig 1b the pattern of lai recovery suggested a certain spatial clustering lai for some sub plots largely recovered to the pre storm value by late january 2014 e g sub plots 11 15 18 21 while others took until early march sub plots 1 10 in some clusters e g sub plots 2 4 7 10 12 14 lai values during the third period exceeded pre typhoon averages while the reverse was seen in other sub plots e g nos 16 20 22 24 similarly values determined in early march 2014 were lower than those in late january in roughly half of the sub plots nos 15 24 fig 1b possibly reflecting the low rainfall in february cf fig 1a recovery of lai in the lowermost plot was comparable to that in the throughfall measurement site by early march 2014 i e about four months after haiyan but that in the more heavily damaged upper plot was still very limited fig 2 b despite the fact that the latter had higher lai values than the other two plots prior to disturbance fig 2a 4 3 rainfall characteristics total rainfall during the 1 june 2013 31 may 2014 study period was 3337 mm including an estimated maximum wind driven input of 50 mm during passage of typhoon haiyan rainfall totals for the three different periods with contrasting canopy conditions were 1113 mm 1474 mm including the cited wind driven rainfall and 750 mm for the pre disturbance disturbed and recovery periods respectively october 2013 and february and may 2014 were drier than usual whereas june and november 2013 as well as january march and especially april 2014 were wetter than normal fig 3b overall the study year was about 25 wetter than normal the rainfall was delivered in 238 individual events separated by 4 h without rain that occurred on 194 days with a recorded rainfall 0 5 mm each on 106 occasions some of which occurred on the same day as larger events rainfall was 0 5 mm totaling 25 mm median rainfall sizes per event in the respective periods were 4 8 5 9 and 2 8 mm about 57 of all events range 49 71 depending on the period under consideration occurred mostly during the day time between 06 00 h and 18 00 h 37 range 22 45 occurred during the night between 18 00 h and 06 00 h while the remaining 6 7 represented continuous rain throughout the day and night table 5 events were mostly relatively small with 46 60 delivering 5 mm and 84 91 having 30 mm depending on the period under consideration only 2 7 5 and 1 2 5 of events were larger than 50 mm and 100 mm respectively with the largest falls recorded during the wet months following typhoon haiyan period 2 table 5 apart from the 8 november typhoon 203 mm plus an estimated maximum of 50 mm of wind driven rain each of the three periods included one large event all related to the passage of a tropical storm viz 28 29 june 2013 172 mm 10 13 january 2014 190 mm and 22 24 march 2014 220 mm together these four large events delivered at least 785 mm of rain or 24 of the annual total 835 mm and 25 after including the estimated contribution of wind driven rain more than half 54 69 of the rainfall events lasted less than 1 h while 4 13 had a duration longer than 5 h with the greatest occurrence of long duration storms observed during period 2 rainfall intensities were relatively low with as much as 46 57 of events having an intensity of 1 5 mm h 1 and only 1 7 5 having average intensities 20 mm h 1 the absolute maximum 5 min rainfall intensity was 131 mm h 1 overall event based average rainfall intensities for the three periods considered ranged from 6 2 to 7 7 mm h 1 while due to the strongly skewed distribution the median rainfall intensities were 4 5 5 4 mm h 1 table 5 4 4 throughfall stemflow and interception losses before and after forest disturbance data for 68 complete manual tf and sf collections i e no overflowing or fallen over gauges were selected to assess spatial variability during each of the three periods with contrasting canopy conditions table 6 differences in average and median tf p fractions between periods were small and not significant despite the fact that the coefficients of variation cv defined as the standard deviation divided by the mean 100 for the corresponding cumulative tf totals were quite modest at 12 21 table 6 supplementary fig 2 after incorporating the gutter based tf observations for the selected storms the differences became more pronounced between the three groups of data with overall average cumulative tf p fractions of 78 85 and 80 respectively suggesting a 7 rise in tf p after defoliation cf table 8 below the stemflow data were also highly skewed and exhibited large cv values 61 69 but stemflow fractions sf p were small throughout the ratio of cumulative sf to cumulative p for the selected collections decreased slightly after canopy disturbance and defoliation from 2 4 in period 1 to 2 1 in period 2 difference not significant and was even lower after foliar recovery 1 6 in period 3 table 6 inserting event rainfall amounts into the relationships linking event sf to p for the respective periods fig 7a below gave average sf p ratios of 2 7 1 3 and 2 0 for pre haiyan disturbed and recovered conditions respectively with an overall annual value of 1 9 median event based sf p ratios decreased with tree size dbh in an exponential fashion but differences between the relationships for the three periods were not significant fig 4 small trees 5 10 cm dbh and making up 62 of all trees with a dbh 5 cm within the measurement plot were estimated to contribute 54 of the total sf at the plot scale before canopy disturbance based on 55 collections versus 63 in period 2 19 collections corresponding values for large trees dbh 20 cm 15 of all trees were 14 and 11 period 2 respectively and 32 and 26 for medium sized trees dbh 10 20 cm 23 of all trees total amounts of sf mm produced by the small trees were significantly higher compared to those for medium or large trees p 0 05 in each of the three periods n 81 collections pre disturbance median sf volumes normalized for rainfall amount i e stemflow volume ratio svr holwerda et al 2006 for different trees ranged from 0 04 to 0 21 l mm 1 supplementary table 1 with an overall value of 0 08 l mm 1 pre disturbance svr values for individual trees of a given species were comparable e g cananga odorata mahogany but values for similarly sized trees belonging to different species differed considerably e g artocarpus versus voacanga in supplementary table 1 svr values were generally reduced after canopy disturbance and did not fully recover to pre disturbance values during period 3 supplementary table 1 expressed in terms of the dimensionless stemflow funneling ratio i e svr tree basal area herwitz 1986 median values ranged from 1 1 to 35 with lower values usually associated with larger trees supplementary table 2 and supplementary fig 3 funneling ratios generally increased with event size up to ca 25 mm of rain or more in the case of small trees after which values more or less stabilized although variability was large interestingly the relationships broke down completely after forest disturbance or changed their mathematical form in the case of some trees experiencing major structural damage e g tree l4 supplementary fig 3 and supplementary table 3 by definition changes in funneling ratios for a given tree between periods reflected those in svr i e they dropped after canopy defoliation and structural disturbance and recovered to some extent during period 3 for some but not all trees supplementary fig 3 4 5 spatio temporal variations in lai and their effect on relative throughfall amounts average tf p ratios for the three periods more or less mirrored the corresponding changes in lai in an inverse manner cf table 6 and fig 1 similar negative trends were obtained when linking average tf p to average lai per period for the 24 sub plots fig 5 a the relation was steepest and strongest for the pre disturbance period r2 0 61 n 59 collections poor and much less steep for the canopy recovery phase period 3 r2 0 20 n 17 collections and non existent for the period with maximum defoliation period 2 r2 0 02 n 9 collections examining pre disturbance data only and distinguishing between three event size classes p 5 mm 5 20 mm and 20 mm maintained the negative trends with the strongest correlation r2 0 64 n 15 collections and steepest slope for the smallest category differing significantly from the relations for the larger event classes the slopes of the corresponding equations for the other two event categories did not differ significantly from each other but their coefficients of determination declined with increasing event size fig 5b a similar pattern was found when distinguishing between rainfall intensity classes fig 5c thus lai appeared to exert the strongest influence on relative tf amounts and hence relative i prior to canopy disturbance for small p 5 mm and low intensity 1 5 mm h 1 events fig 5b c 4 6 canopy structural parameters as derived from throughfall and stemflow measurements values for the main canopy parameters used in the interception modeling canopy saturation value s direct throughfall coefficient p trunk storage capacity s t and the proportion of rainfall diverted to stemflow p t were derived for the three periods with contrasting canopy conditions from measured p tf and sf for selected storms figs 6 and 7 table 7 summarizes the results for the respective periods along with the corresponding values of the amount of rainfall required to fully wet the canopy p g and average evaporation rates from a saturated canopy e following gash 1979 the canopy saturation value for the manobo forest derived with the jackson method dropped from 0 45 mm for the pre haiyan period period 1 to a low 0 30 mm during the period with the most extensive canopy damage period 2 and recovered somewhat subsequently 0 35 mm fig 6 and table 7 values of s derived with the mean method were identical to those obtained with the jackson method for periods 1 and 3 but slightly lower 0 24 mm for period 2 figs 6 7b and table 7 changes in the direct throughfall coefficient mirrored those for s in that p increased from 0 30 for period 1 to as high as 0 61 during period 2 and 0 42 for period 3 fig 6 and table 7 although sf constituted only a small fraction of incident p regardless of canopy conditions table 6 the regression equations linking sf and p were quite strong fig 7a stemflow coefficients p t ranged from 0 033 for period 1 to 0 015 during period 2 with an intermediate value 0 023 for period 3 correlations between event based interception loss i and p were less strong than those for sf 0 82 0 95 with coefficients of determination ranging from 0 37 period 2 to 0 69 period 3 and 0 70 period 1 fig 7b the slopes of the respective equations i e e r cf gash 1979 varied from 0 14 period 1 to 0 10 period 2 and back to 0 15 period 3 suggesting values of 0 70 0 55 and 0 66 mm h 1 respectively for e using median rather than average rainfall intensities in view of the strong negative skewness of the latter cf table 5 finally combining the values of s c and e c r for the respective periods gave values of ca 0 7 mm for the amount of rainfall required to saturate the canopy eq 2 p g table 7 4 7 model application to estimate period totals of interception loss that included a number of large storms for which tf and sf data were incomplete due to overflowing or disturbed collectors the revised analytical model of rainfall interception was tested against measured i for the data from which the forest structural and other model parameter values listed in table 7 were derived the model overestimated the observed total interception loss for the pre disturbance and recovery periods only slightly by 1 8 and 1 3 respectively with corresponding root mean square errors of 0 83 and 0 97 mm while effectively equaling the observed i for period 2 0 1 rmse 0 49 mm table 8 optimizing the model for e c r to minimize the rmse between modeled and observed i cf schellekens et al 1999 ghimire et al 2017 reproduced observed interception totals for periods 1 and 3 slightly better in terms of relative model error 0 8 and 0 1 respectively but did not reduce the associated rmse values optimizing the value of s did not have any effect on model performance optimizing wet canopy evaporation rate and the canopy saturation value did not improve predictions for the second period either table 8 and fig 8 next the best performing model parameterization was applied to estimate period and annual totals of i using the complete rainfall record overall annual i estimated in this way amounted to 514 mm 15 of p with period values ranging from 18 prior to forest disturbance period 1 to 12 after extensive defoliation period 2 and 17 5 during the successive canopy recovery phase period 3 table 9 the effect of canopy disturbance by typhoon haiyan on annual i was assessed by comparing the previously obtained periodical and annual losses reflecting the changing canopy conditions with that predicted by the model using pre disturbance parameter values throughout 572 mm or 17 of annual p table 9 the model attributed nearly three quarters 73 of the predicted annual i for undisturbed canopy conditions to evaporation from a fully wetted canopy 18 to evaporation after rainfall has ceased drying up phase and 4 by evaporation during small storms losses associated with canopy wetting 2 and evaporation from trunks 3 were equally minor table 9 at 58 mm i e 572 minus 514 mm the inferred reduction in annual interception loss due to the temporary defoliation caused by typhoon haiyan and the subsequent gradual recovery of lai at the middle plot is modest at best equaling only 1 7 of annual p but 10 of i for an undisturbed canopy 4 8 wet canopy evaporation versus rainfall intensity during large storms the data set used for the calibration of the revised analytical model did not include four very large events during which most if not all manual tf collectors overflowed to test whether wet canopy evaporation rates were substantially different during these very large 172 220 mm events hourly tf amounts recorded by the two large gutters during the raining episodes of three of these events excluding typhoon haiyan because of its excessive winds and the disturbing effects these had on the measurement of both p and tf as well as the forest canopy itself were compared with corresponding hourly rainfall totals to derive associated amounts of apparent i all in mm h 1 hourly evaporative losses were positively correlated with rainfall intensity especially for individual events fig 9 maximum values of hourly interception loss inferred in this way were as high as 5 6 mm and therefore far exceeded the period average wet canopy evaporation rates 0 55 0 70 mm h 1 table 7 pertinently the relationship was steeper for the 10 january 2014 event during which time lai was much reduced figs 9 and 1a 5 discussion 5 1 typhoon effects on forest structure although all trees in the three sample plots total area 1850 m2 were affected by typhoon haiyan tables 3 and 4 spatial contrasts in the level of incurred canopy damage reflected clear differences in site exposure damage was more extensive and recovery of lai much slower in the more exposed upper forest plot compared to the more sheltered middle and lower plots table 4 and fig 2b winds in excess of 100 130 km h 1 can damage trees lethally within several hours while wind speeds above ca 60 km h 1 typically cause large scale defoliation scatena et al 2005 maximum wind speeds recorded around the time of the cyclone s landfall in the early morning of 8 november 2013 were as high as 314 km h 1 87 m s 1 rabonza et al 2015 with wind speeds sustained over 10 min of up to 230 km h 1 64 m s 1 nguyen et al 2014 wind speeds experienced by the trees on the ridges and uppermost slopes of the manobo forest are likely to have been equally high generally older and therefore taller and more prominent trees tend to be more vulnerable to crown damage by high wind basnet et al 1992 lin et al 2011 but large trees were effectively lacking at manobo where 85 of the trees had a dbh 20 cm rather in view of the fact that fast growing species of low wood density are more amenable to damage than slower growing later successional species putz 1983 zimmerman et al 1994 the observed high spatial variability in leaf area reduction after typhoon passage fig 1b may reflect a combination of differences in individual tree height affecting local turbulence and crown exposure and wood strength branch breakage however despite the extensive crown damage recorded during the january 2014 survey tables 3 and 4 lai values for the relatively sheltered middle and lower plots reached pre disturbance values again after ca four months 6 march 2014 fig 2 comparable spatial contrasts in forest damage as a function of site exposure have been reported for puerto rico walker 1991 scatena et al 1993 1996 and taiwan lee et al 2008 it has been suggested that planted forests like the manobo reforest may be less well adapted than natural forests and thus suffer greater typhoon hurricane damage e g caribbean pines in nicaragua and fiji boucher et al 1990 waterloo 1994 mahogany in puerto rico basnet et al 1992 however the greater damage to mahogany trees in the puerto rican case was caused in part by the fact that introduced tree species had been preferably planted in moister valley soils that provided less anchoring opportunity basnet et al 1992 similarly typhoon damage to natural broad leaved forest in central taiwan was reported to be greater than that to nearby coniferous plantations due to differences in site exposure lee et al 2008 all exotic mahogany and gmelina trees at manobo were severely damaged by typhoon haiyan and were subsequently felled during a timber salvaging operation with the expected gradual increase in strength of typhoons in general knutson et al 2010 kossin et al 2014 and an intensification of super typhoons in particular due to global warming induced upper oceanic freshening balaguru et al 2016 the structure and development of secondary forests in the cyclone ridden north western tropical pacific de gouvenain and silander 2003 is likely to be affected increasingly by typhoons in the future see lin et al 2011 and yao et al 2015 for a discussion of the ecological consequences despite a slight decrease in the total number of tropical storms crossing the philippines in recent years cinco et al 2016 5 2 forest disturbance effects on interception loss studies of the effects of large scale tropical forest destruction by wind as opposed to gap creation by selective logging asdak et al 1998b chappell et al 2001 on rainfall interception loss are rare long term rainfall and throughfall data for the bisley forest in puerto rico suggested a return to normal tf p ratios within a year after forest wreckage by hurricane hugo scatena et al 1996 while heartsill scalley et al 2007 reported further enhanced but unquantified tf p ratios for the seven week period after passage of hurricanes bertha 1996 and georges 1998 at bisley compared to the preceding seven week period neither study attempted to separate the strong seasonal variation in tf p for the bisley forest schellekens et al 1999 from that incurred by actual storm damage so that the overall effect on annual interception loss remains unknown waterloo 1994 estimated i from two pinus caribaea plantations in fiji before and after they were struck by cyclone sina in november 1990 there was a major reduction in wet season i for the younger of the two plantations from 22 in 1990 to 11 shortly after the storm in 1991 but values for pre and post cyclone dry season i were already similar 2 higher in 1991 after seven months of re foliation pre and post storm differences for an older stand were less pronounced 3 4 reduction in i and possibly reflected a smaller reduction in lai waterloo 1994 this reduction in interception loss is similar to the typhoon induced change in annual i estimated for the manobo reforest 1 7 of annual p table9 although the absolute difference is larger because of the much higher rainfall in the philippines neal et al 1993 also found a 4 decrease in i p for a mature beech forest in the southern u k during the first year after it was hit by a major storm summarizing the effect of major canopy disturbance by high winds on rainfall interception loss appears to be both temporary 4 12 months and comparatively modest 4 of annual p although it remains to be seen what the cumulative effects will be of more intensive or more frequent disturbances in future cf cinco et al 2016 lin et al 2011 yao et al 2015 it is of interest to compare these wind induced disturbance effects with the impact of seasonal changes in lai on interception loss i e defoliation but no added gap creation and that of selective logging gap creation only tanaka et al 2015 did not find any difference in tf p ratios for mature teak plantations in thailand during the leafless and leafed states rainfall amount was the only variable explaining tf during the growing season while temperature maximum wind speed and rainfall intensity were also influential during the leafless dry season in a companion study on the effects of climatic and canopy conditions on sf production by teak trees tanaka et al 2017 reported increased sf p ratios during the leafless state for five out of nine sampled trees no significant change in three others and a reduction in the one remaining sample tree interestingly the trees exhibiting an increase in sf p did not experience shading by neighbouring crowns in the leafed state whereas the other trees did despite considerable variability between individual trees the median stemflow funneling ratio increased during the leafless season tanaka et al 2017 chen and li 2016 did not find any difference in wet and dry season i from a sub tropical forest in taiwan despite major contrasts in seasonal lai 52 drop in the dry season although the tf p ratio increased somewhat during the dry season this was compensated by an equal reduction in sf p pertinently while evaporation from a wetted canopy was the dominant interception component throughout the year the ratio between the latter and the amount contributed by the drying up phase more than tripled 1 4 versus 4 9 in the dry season this marked shift reflected both a lower dry season canopy saturation value s causing smaller losses during canopy drying and a much lower average dry season rainfall intensity 2 8 versus 5 8 mm h 1 chen and li 2016 cf gash et al 1995 at manobo where median rainfall intensities were effectively similar between periods table 5 the reduction in s following the passage of typhoon haiyan from 0 45 mm to 0 24 0 30 mm table 7 also caused a reduction in the inferred contribution of canopy drying to total i from 22 to 10 predicted evaporation from the saturated canopy increased from 68 prior to forest disturbance to 84 after typhoon haiyan table 9 implying an upward shift in the ratio between the two interception components from 3 1 to 8 4 in agreement with the findings of chen and li 2016 for natural forest in taiwan but unlike the results obtained by tanaka et al 2017 for teak plantations in thailand stemflow at manobo both in terms of sf p ratios and funneling ratios decreased after defoliation by typhoon haiyan and recuperated somewhat after the lai increased again in period 3 fig 7b and supplementary fig 3 however sf production is the result of complex interactions between both spatio temporal variations in tree architecture and a range of climatic factors tanaka et al 2017 thus simple comparisons between leafed and leafless states are unlikely to provide the full answer just like predictive approaches based on tree characteristics do not get very far especially not in species rich tropical forests zimmermann et al 2015 one might expect gap creation during logging to increase the aerodynamic conductance g a due to the associated increase in canopy surface unevenness thereby enhancing turbulent exchange and thus evaporative losses during and immediately after rainfall instead asdak et al 1998a reported a marked decrease in g a and i p upon opening a rain forest canopy in kalimantan similar decreases in g a were derived by deguchi et al 2006 for the leafless phase of a warm temperate deciduous forest in japan and by teklehaimanot et al 1991 for a series of temperate coniferous plantations of progressively lower stocking none of these studies provided a physical explanation for the reduction in g a but it is likely that defoliation and opening of the canopy by logging or thinning also leads to deeper ventilation i e a lowering of the displacement and roughness lengths d and z 0 and thus to a lower g a thom 1975 however as stated by asdak et al 1998a and indicated by our modeling table 9 the observed reductions in i p after canopy opening or defoliation reflect both changes in wet canopy evaporation rates and reduced canopy saturation values cf table 7 5 3 effects of canopy heterogeneity on throughfall relative throughfall amounts tf p in the manobo forest were inversely related to canopy density as represented by measurements of lai above individual tf collectors under undisturbed canopy conditions r2 0 61 fig 5a corresponding relations for the two post typhoon periods were less steep and not significant fig 5a as such lai alone is a rather poor predictor of on site tf p as also reported for mature rain forests in ecuador r2 0 12 fleischbein et al 2005 puerto rico r2 0 12 0 21 holwerda 2005 and indonesia r2 0 02 dietz et al 2006 as well as for tree plantations in panamá park and cameron 2008 in addition results become poorer as rainfall event size or intensity increased fig 5b c possibly because of the larger variability in event sizes involved with increasing rainfall compared to the relatively small variation in tf p cf holwerda 2005 somewhat better results were obtained when using a measure of canopy openness instead of lai fleischbein et al 2005 or using canopy depth and openness as added variables park and cameron 2008 cf dietz et al 2006 however the strong dependency of such relations on rainfall amount or intensity fig 5b c already indicates that forest structural parameters alone have limited predictive capacity in this regard in addition many of these structural parameters are correlated with one another rendering the use of multiple regression approaches problematic zimmermann et al 2013 in a particularly stringent study involving multiple stands of different ages and characteristics under similar climatic conditions zimmermann et al 2013 concluded that the best tf p predictor was the basal area fraction contributed by small trees r2 0 72 5 4 interception loss from regenerating tropical forests the manobo reforest in perspective despite the modest age and stature of the manobo reforest 23 years and 7 3 m tall at the start of the interception measurements both the observed cumulative pre haiyan interception loss for selected storms 18 table 8 and the modeled annual i for undisturbed canopy conditions 17 table 9 are in the upper part of the range of values derived for old growth lowland evergreen rain forests in south east asia 8 22 as well as those for most regenerating forests 3 21 table 10 although results obtained for different forests reflect differences in canopy density and local rainfall intensities for a given forest type there appears to be a distinct trend towards lower i p values for studies employing a larger number of tf collectors e g old growth lowland forests in table 10 such findings are usually interpreted in terms of the ability of the sampling design to adequately include drip points i e points of locally enhanced tf p ratios lloyd and de marques filho 1988 manfroi et al 2006 yet it would be premature to attribute the relatively high i p value derived for the manobo reforest to inadequate sampling on top of the 24 roving tf gauges two large gutters were used which effectively doubled the sampling area to the equivalent of 48 gauges also with coefficients of variation cv for our mean manually obtained tf estimates ranging from 11 5 period 1 to 21 period 3 throughfall variability at manobo table 6 cf supplementary fig 2 was much less than that observed for more biodiverse mature rain forests in central kalimantan 36 for 18 roving gauges vernimmen et al 2007 panamá 49 for 30 fixed gauges macinnis ng et al 2012 and puerto rico 23 for 30 roving gauges holwerda et al 2006 rather our cumulative cvs were comparable to the 15 24 reported for lowland rain forest after some selective logging in north east borneo and using a very large number of fixed tf samplers n 80 chappell et al 2001 while the interception results for regenerating tropical forests collated in table 10 vary widely as a result of differences in canopy characteristics sampling design and rainfall regime e g length of dry season rainfall intensity and duration certain broad patterns do arise first i p for very young 1 5 yr regrowth is generally enhanced the most relative to i p in old growth lowland rain forest while differences between primary and secondary forest during the next five years of succession or later are already hard to discern the comparative short term work by zimmermann et al 2013 in 16 forest stands in panamá that ranged between 3 and 30 years of age provides further confirmation that tf p ratios for forests older than 10 years may not be statistically distinguishable from those for nearby old growth forest however the range reported for their seven 5 7 year old forests was considerable 87 3 101 6 of p secondly stemflow is often much higher in young forests up to 10 years of age with an exceptionally high value recorded for 10 year old regrowth dominated by the banana like phenakospermum hölscher et al 1998 overall there is a dearth of systematic studies in 5 15 year old forests that include sf as well as tf measurements over an entire seasonal cycle changes in forest structure notably lai tree density and height are especially pronounced during the first decade of regrowth zimmermann et al 2013 scatena et al 1996 and this is reflected in rapid changes in relative amounts of tf and especially sf during this phase table 10 furthermore most studies to date may well have under estimated sf by not including the stemflow contributions by very small trees and saplings whose funneling ratios are typically high manfroi et al 2004 honda et al 2014 gonzález martínez et al 2017 this would seem all the more important for young forests where smaller trees are likely more abundant zimmermann et al 2013 chazdon 2014 cf supplementary fig 1 5 5 wet canopy evaporation rates versus rainfall intensity for the two periods having more or less fully developed foliage i e periods 1 and 3 tf based wet canopy evaporation rates at manobo e tf 0 66 0 70 mm h 1 table 7 were much higher than e pm values reported

range of values derived for other south east asian lowland rain forests and tree plantations 0 5 0 8 mm h 1 asdak et al 1998a dykes 1997 vernimmen et al 2007 waterloo 1994 similar discrepancies between e pm and e tf have been reported for many forests and may be attributable to various factors recently reviewed by van dijk et al 2015 particularly the underestimation of aerodynamic conductance to moisture exchange between the vegetation and the overlying air g a holwerda et al 2012 unaccounted horizontal advection of warmer and drier air from nearby areas without rain stewart 1977 asdak et al 1998a cisneros vaca et al 2018 release of thermal energy stored in the ecosystem itself especially at the beginning of a storm michiles dos and gielow 2008 cisneros vaca et al 2018 and possibly larger scale advection of sensible heat from the ocean in specific settings shuttleworth and calder 1979 blyth et al 1994 given the modest stature of the manobo reforest release of stored thermal energy is less likely to be important but being situated within 2 km from the pacific ocean lateral transfer of sensible heat from the warm ocean waters off the coast of leyte cannot be ruled out especially at night when air temperatures drop below those of seawater typically 27 29 c according to roberts et al 2005 a horizontal temperature gradient of 3 4 k per 100 m would be sufficient to sustain a wet canopy evaporation rate of 0 5 mm h 1 roughly the difference between e tf and e pm at manobo night time minimum air temperatures measured at the basper grassland site 3 5 km from manobo were around 26 2 c throughout the year and therefore generally not low enough to reach a 3 4 k difference in temperature between land and sea further drops in air temperature during rainfall were generally small 1 5 c on average but occasionally up to 6 c this suggests substantial downward from the air rather than lateral from the ocean transfer of sensible heat to maintain the observed high values of e tf cf stewart 1977 blyth et al 1994 cisneros vaca et al 2018 indeed holwerda et al 2012 drew attention to the fact that on average values of e tf derived for eight oceanic tropical sites were not enhanced relative to five more continental sites as had been suggested previously shuttleworth and calder 1979 schellekens et al 1999 rather values of e tf tended to be enhanced within each group at sites located in dissected or mountainous terrain as opposed to sites situated in less complex terrain suggesting aerodynamic roughness at the landscape scale to be a key factor although holwerda et al 2012 admitted that a larger comparative data set would be needed to draw firmer conclusions no measurements of g a are available for the study forest but the manobo ridge is the first topographic rise encountered by moist winds coming from the ocean suggesting potentially enhanced turbulence and vapour exchange between the forest canopy and the air holwerda et al 2012 hourly wet canopy evaporation rates e tf during large and extended storms at manobo showed a strong and positive relation to hourly rainfall intensity r fig 9 murakami 2006 found the same phenomenon in a coastal warm temperate forest in japan and suggested that this could be caused by enhanced evaporation of fine splash droplets created when high energy raindrops hit the canopy during intense rainfall as pointed out by dunkerley 2009 dunin et al 1988 had earlier suggested an effectively similar mechanism adding that turnover of water vapour generated in this way may be accelerated with increasing rainfall intensity due to an associated increase in the frequency and turbulent intensity of downdrafts splash impact droplets are produced in large numbers above a threshold r of about 3 4 mm h 1 dunkerley 2009 with a doubling of impact velocity causing a ten fold increase in the number of splash droplets stow and stainer 1977 rainfall intensities at manobo exceed 5 mm h 1 i e well above the cited 3 4 mm h 1 threshold for about half the time that it rains table 5 cf zhang et al 2018a suggesting a distinct possibility of splash impact droplet generation as well as intensified downdrafts and thus canopy ventilation interestingly the relationship between hourly e and r at high intensities was steeper for the storm sampled on 10 january 2014 when lai was low after defoliation by typhoon haiyan figs 9 and 1a since opening of the canopy reduces both g a and the canopy saturation value s see section 5 1 the observed steepening of the relationship following defoliation also reported by waterloo 1994 but attributed by him to drier post cyclone conditions cf tanaka et al 2015 might reflect enhanced production of splash droplets by rain hitting the now exposed branches as well as enhanced ventilation deguchi et al 2006 further work could focus on droplet spectra generated on foliated versus defoliated canopies subject to comparable rainfall intensities and on the effect of high rainfall intensity on added ventilation and mixing of air within the canopy dunkerley 2009 van dijk et al 2015 cf dunin et al 1988 nevertheless regardless of the actual mechanism involved high rates of e will require sufficient amounts of additional sensible heat as such there is a distinct need for more information on the changes in temperature and humidity with height above forest canopies shuttleworth and calder 1979 blyth et al 1994 cisneros vaca et al 2018 6 conclusions throughfall tf stemflow sf and rainfall p were measured for a year in a coastal reforest 23 years old at manobo leyte island philippines the forest was hit by super typhoon haiyan in november 2013 which caused extensive defoliation and canopy damage nevertheless leaf area index lai at relatively sheltered mid and foot slope locations recovered more or less to pre disturbance values after ca 4 months rainfall partitioning was analyzed separately therefore for three periods with contrasting canopy conditions viz i pre disturbance ii maximum defoliation and iii largely recovered foliage stemflow made up a small percentage of incident p with weighted mean sf p ratios of 2 7 1 3 and 2 0 for the respective periods and an overall mean of 2 small trees 5 10 cm diameter contributed 54 pre haiyan to 63 post haiyan of all stemflow weighted mean throughfall as measured by 24 roving collectors and two large fixed recording gutters for the above data set varied from 78 of incident precipitation before canopy disturbance to 85 during the period with the most extensive defoliation and 80 after initial foliage recovery the manually collected tf data exhibited modest cumulative coefficients of variation compared to values reported for several more species rich old growth rain forests pre typhoon disturbance values of rainfall interception loss i for the semi mature manobo reforest fall in the upper part of the range reported for old growth lowland rain forests in south east asia the effect of canopy disturbance on annual i at the relatively sheltered mid slope measurement site was assessed through modeling and appeared to be modest 2 of p on an annual basis although it remains to be seen what the effects would be of repeated and more frequent disturbances of similar magnitude events in future as a result of climatic intensification cf balaguru et al 2016 relative amounts of tf at manobo were inversely related to lai during conditions of full foliage but the relation broke down upon canopy disturbance moreover the relationships were strongest for small storms 5 mm and low rainfall intensities 5 mm h 1 hourly wet canopy evaporation rates during large and extensive rainfall events were strongly correlated with hourly rainfall intensities and far exceeded values sustained by available radiation although horizontal advection of sensible heat from the nearby ocean cannot be excluded such high evaporation rates are most likely caused by downward advection of sensible heat from the overlying atmosphere in addition high rainfall intensities at manobo may generate a large number of splash droplets that are more amenable to rapid evaporation acknowledgements we are

6841,understanding variations in soil moisture and soil water potential is important for describing hydrological processes at the hillslope scale an intensive field campaign to measure soil moisture soil water potential and rainfall events was performed at many locations and depths to obtain seasonal and spatial distributions of hydrometric measurements along steep hillslopes soil moisture and soil water tension analysis showed seasonally distinctive features in statistics and probability distributions the relationship between soil moisture and soil water tension was explored to characterize seasonal and spatial variations the recession slopes of soil moisture at several given points of the relationship were also seasonally different the brooks and corey model and the van genuchten model were used to estimate parameters for the measured data to explain the spatial and seasonal variations soil water storage analysis not only indicated that lateral flow tends to be abundant at greater depths but also revealed a seasonal trend in development of subsurface flow in the downslope direction the combined impact of topography and vegetation determined the seasonal

introduction soil moisture plays important roles in infiltration evapotranspiration and solute transport in the unsaturated zone and it is a key factor in plant growth and the dynamics of the ecosystem blume et al 2009 corradini 2014 feng et al 2012 rodriguez iturbe and porporato 2004 teuling et al 2010 at the hillslope scale soil moisture is an important hydrological attribute for hydrological processes including rainfall runoff and erosion processes antinoro et al 2017 haga et al 2005 kim 2009 nippen et al 2011 spatial and temporal distributions of soil moisture can be controlled by various environmental factors such as precipitation topography soil texture and vegetation gwak and kim 2017 liang et al 2014 nippen et al 2011 rosenbaum et al 2012 vereecken et al 2014 additionally spatial and temporal distributions of soil moisture and soil pressure result from mutual interactions between the vertical flow of unsaturated zones and the generation of lateral subsurface storm flows lepore et al 2013 tsutsumi et al 2005 uchida et al 2004 soil water tension is another important variable that determines water movement in the unsaturated zone a theoretical study of unsaturated flow generation was supported by field measurements of soil tension and field pressure measurements for two dimensional flow analysis harr 1977 weyman 1973 laboratory measurements indicated the role of subsurface topography in the formation of lateral downslope flow profiles based on the angles of subsurface boundaries sinai and dirksen 2006 the complicated hydrometeorological conditions and soil heterogeneity in field conditions result in a wide distribution of flow vectors in the three dimensional field which is more temporally dynamic and nonlinear than are laboratory simulations or numerical studies gwak et al 2017 lu et al 2011 lv et al 2013 the impact of soil tension on plant growth and yield as well as its relationship to both leaf and root area indices have also been studied alamilla magańa et al 2016 ng et al 2016 the relationship between soil moisture and soil tension is broadly described by soil moisture characteristic curves smccs which also indicate the available water for plants through the wilting point air entry value and residual water content along the curves smccs obtained from field monitoring and from laboratory measurements have been studied in the context of hysteresis and the slope of the curve considering the distribution of soil pores iiyama 2016 li et al 2005 morgan et al 2001 the determinants of soil moisture and soil water tension in a hillslope can be divided into steady state factors e g topography and soil and temporally varying factors e g rainfall and land use coleman and niemann 2012 hu and si 2014 huang et al 2016 penna et al 2009 zucco et al 2014 both soil moisture and soil water tension strongly depend on various hydrological processes such as infiltration exfiltration lateral flow and transpiration which have a strong seasonal feature therefore the impact of temporally varying hydro meteorological components e g rainfall and eco hydrological factors e g vegetation on soil moisture and soil water tension can be seasonally distinct the history of dynamic determinants can affect the response pattern of soil moisture and soil water tension to a given rainfall feature such as rainfall amount and intensity therefore the status of hydrological processes cannot be assumed to be static but is transitional from spring to autumn many studies have used hydrometric measurements to understand nonlinear hydrologic behavior at the hillslope scale anderson et al 2009 blume et al 2009 freer et al 2004 haga et al 2005 kim 2009 however soil moisture distribution analysis in such studies was performed through identification of probability density functions without consideration for seasonal context brocca et al 2007 romano et al 2018 vereecken et al 2014 therefore understanding seasonal differences in hydrometric measurements such as soil moisture and soil water tension can be useful in characterizing the impact of determinants of hydrological processes the transitional behavior of soil moisture can be characterized through seasonal identification of probability distribution functions and patterns of variation in soil moisture and soil water tension after rainfall events can be quantified through evaluation of recessions or increases in rates for the corresponding period furthermore the relationship between soil moisture and soil water potential in hillslopes soil depth and seasonal period can provide an alternative perspective for understanding hydrological processes in this study a time series of soil moisture and soil water potential was intensively collected at many locations and depths along a steep forested hillslope for more than seven months statistics frequency analysis recession rate storage analysis and the relationship between soil moisture and soil water tension were explored to address the following research questions 1 how can seasonal and spatial differences in soil moisture and soil water tension in steep forested hillslopes be characterized 2 how can the relationship between soil moisture and soil water tension be expressed in terms of spatial and seasonal differences and what hydrological determinants and processes influence this relationship 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the study area is a steep forested hillslope located in the sulmachun catchment in paju kyeongki province south korea fig 1 the sulmachun catchment has an area of approximately 8 5 km2 and is mainly covered by forest hydrometeorological data e g rainfall streamflow temperature and humidity data had been collected over the past 25 years at seven hydrological monitoring stations fig 1 the studied hillslope which is located in the headwater region of the sulmachun catchment has an area of approximately 4000 m2 an elevation of 200 260 m above sea level and surface slopes between 20 and 35 the bedrock underlying the hillslope consists of gneissic granite and fracture development is negligible the dominant soil type is leptosol but cambisol soil occurs at greater depths we collected 15 soil samples at all soil moisture monitoring locations for soil particle analysis and these samples indicated that the predominant soil textures according to the usda soil texture standard were sandy loam and loamy sand sand 67 0 9 1 silt 30 3 8 2 clay 2 7 8 2 table 1 presents fractions of soil composition at all monitoring points in the study area the mean bulk density of the soil samples was 1 36 g cm3 with a standard deviation of 0 057 and mean porosity of 48 the topographic features of the monitoring points such as local slope tanb topographic wetness index twi quinn et al 1991 and distance to stream ds are presented in table 1 the depth of the soil ranged from 25 to 95 cm and the depth of the root zone was approximately 20 30 cm generally soil became deeper with distance in the downslope direction vegetation within the study area consists of a mixture of polemoniales shrubby quercus and a coniferous canopy of pinus densiflora there was no difference in canopy density along the hillslope the leaf area indices lais measured using an lai 2000 device li cor biosciences 2004 varied between 0 98 and 1 06 for november and between 2 98 and 3 97 for may the mean annual rainfall for the previous five years was approximately 1636 mm with a standard deviation of 268 mm and 70 of the total rainfall occurred during the asian monsoon season between june and august the mean annual evaporation which was estimated by the eddy covariance method using data obtained from a flux tower 50 m from the study area was approximately 420 mm the temperature varied between 15 and 35 c 2 2 hydrometric measurements of the hillslope a tipping bucket rain gauge te525mm campbell scientific inc logan ut usa was installed in the middle of the hillslope and rainfall data were collected between april and november 2010 fig 1 the spatial distribution of soil water flow was evaluated under the assumption that soil water was governed primarily by the terrain of the humid mountainous hillslope anderson and kneale 1980 to address the spatial pattern of soil moisture redistribution in the monitoring network digital terrain analysis of the surface and subsurface digital elevation models dems were employed quinn et al 1991 wilson et al 2004 the locations of soil moisture sensors were determined based on wetness index distribution by addressing the frequency distribution of wetness index between high and low in almost identical interval along transects a points a1 a8 and b points b1 b8 and a downslope region c points c1 c3 fig 1 considering the soil depths in the study area and feasibility of waveguide insertion soil moisture data were collected at depths of 10 30 and 60 cm waveguides of time domain reflectometers tdrs were inserted horizontally in an upslope direction at depths of 10 30 and 60 cm while attempting to minimize disturbance of the soil matrix a buriable waveguide with a length and diameter of 20 cm and 0 3 cm respectively and a multiplex minitrase soil moisture equipment corp 2005 were used temporal variations in soil moisture content were recorded at bi hourly intervals between april and december 2010 to measure pressure variations in the soil layer a set of pressure measurement systems was installed at points a2 a4 a5 and a8 along the hillslope fig 1 due to uneven soil depths at these locations tensiometers were installed at two or three depths out of 30 50 60 80 or 90 cm according to feasibility of equipment installation at each location tensiometer rods soilmoisture equipment were installed in early april 2010 and soil tension data were obtained between the end of april and middle of november 2010 pressure transducers were connected three weeks after the initial installation to stabilize the potential field around the porous cups of the tensiometers to ensure stabilized pressure between the porous cups and the surrounding soil only data collected between may and november of 2010 were analyzed the gt3 15 and gt3 30 tensiometer transducers from ict international armidale au were able to detect pressure within the ranges of 100 to 0 kpa and 100 to 100 kpa respectively with a resolution of 0 1 kpa the soil water tension time series was obtained at 1 min intervals and moving averages of the measurements over 10 min intervals which is the appropriate sampling interval to capture the bypass flow were recorded by a data logger cr1000 campbell scientific inc the soil tension data were converted to bi hourly interval data through moving average to fit the relationship with soil moisture data the soil water storage for a point during a rainfall event can be evaluated through multiplication of the soil depth and the difference between the maximum soil moisture and the antecedent soil moisture the net rainfall amount can be calculated by subtracting the amount of canopy interception and potential evapotranspiration from the rainfall amount for a rainfall event the comparison between the net rainfall amount and soil water storage indicates how much the water from rainfall at the point contributes to the change in water storage 2 3 smcc models for parameter estimation the brooks and corey model bc model is a widely used equation for plotting the smcc the bc model can be expressed as follows 1 θ ψ h b λ ψ h b 2 θ 1 ψ h b where θ is the effective saturation and can is calculated by the equation θ θ θ r θ s θ r where θ is the volumetric moisture content and θ s and θ r are the saturated volumetric moisture content and residual volumetric moisture content respectively in eqs 1 and 2 ψ is the soil tension and h b and λ are fitting parameters the parameter h b is related to the air entry value of the soil and the parameter λ is related to the pore size distribution of the soil the van genuchten model vg model which can be an alternative to the bc model is the most widely adopted continuous smcc model that describes the entire smcc the vg model uses three fitting parameters namely n m and α using the relationship m 1 1 n the vg model can be expressed as follows 3 θ 1 1 α ψ n 1 1 n where α n and m are empirically fitted parameters the parameter α is related to the inverse of the air entry value the parameter n is related to the pore size distribution of the soil and the parameter m is related to the asymmetry of the model the vg model is complex and relies more on fitting parameters than do other models but it provides a better depiction of the smcc under most circumstances 3 results 3 1 statistics in soil moisture measurements fig 2 a shows a box plot of soil moisture statistics at a depth of 10 cm along transect a the average minimum and maximum soil moistures from point a1 10 to point a8 10 showed no notable trend in spatial distribution except for one exceptionally high soil moisture at point a6 10 the highest soil moistures at points a6 10 and a6 20 fig 2 a and b can be explained by smaller soil layer depth and quicker response than the others soil moisture statistics at 30 cm and 60 cm depths fig 2 b and c showed an increasing trend in minimum average and maximum values in the downslope direction aside from the points at the a5 location the discontinuity in the increasing trend between points at a4 and a5 in fig 2 b and the lower soil moisture variation of point a5 shown in fig 2 c can be explained by the discontinuity in soil moisture connectivity in the water transfer processes kim 2012 for this hillslope the low soil moisture of point a7 can also be explained by the relatively small contributing area ca for point a7 table 1 the low soil moisture at point a8 10 fig 2 a is associated with the substantial macropore development at surface of the downslope part no notable trend was observed in the variance of soil moisture along transect a soil moistures at the 10 cm depth along transect b also showed no notable trend in spatial distribution in the downslope direction fig 2 d the dominance in vertical flow in the upslope and mid slope of the study area can be explained by the lack of connectivity in soil moisture redistribution to the downslope at the 10 cm depth kim 2012 however soil moisture at depths of 30 and 60 cm along transect b fig 2 e and f showed an increasing trend toward the downslope direction substantial subsurface lateral flow could explain the higher wetness as the monitoring points were located closer to the end of the hillslope correlation analysis of the soil moisture measurements and soil or topography factors shown in table 1 indicates that the highest correlations were for twi to soil moisture at 30 cm depth r 0 67 and ds to soil moisture at 60 cm depth r 0 70 for the autumn season when the impact of topography is most pronounced to other controls such as rainfall and vegetation 3 2 probability density functions in soil moisture the characteristics of soil moisture distribution were further explored through frequency analysis probability distribution functions pdfs widely used in hydrological applications e g gumbel frechet weibull log pearson lognormal normal and gamma distributions were used through continuous fittings between measurements both the kolmogorov smirov test and the chi squared test were used to verify pdfs and the anderson darling test was employed to evaluate the goodness of fit gamage et al 2013 as presented in table 2 the best fitted pdfs for soil moisture datasets were the gumbel weibull and lognormal distributions which were dominant in the spring rainy and autumn seasons respectively relatively diverse distributions were found for the rainy season and extreme distributions tended to be delineated in the two dry seasons the degree of homogeneity in pdfs was stronger during the spring season than during other seasons and the skewness in pdfs was increased e g dominance in lognormal distributions during the autumn season the strong development of vegetation during the spring season may have neutralized the diversity in soil moisture pdfs 3 3 soil tension measurements a time series of soil water tension was collected at locations a2 a4 a5 and a8 at two or three depths depending on the depth of soil and the feasibility of measurement device installation the statistics of soil water tension measurements are presented in table 3 for three different seasons spring rainy and autumn the means of soil water tension cm h2o were between 15 7 and 69 3 in the spring and between 4 4 and 76 3 and 46 8 and 387 2 in the rainy season and in autumn respectively table 3 less spatial variation in soil water tension during the spring than during the rainy season can be explained by more frequent rainfall in the latter season substantially higher spatial variation in soil water tension during autumn than during spring was also observed coefficients of variation for the rainy season were also higher than those for spring and autumn especially at deeper and farther downslope points such as a5 80 and a8 90 high contributing areas cas and topographic wetness indices twis in table 1 where substantial lateral flow was expected the skewness of soil water tension in the spring was between 0 4 and 0 4 but those in the rainy season and autumn were between 0 5 and 2 4 and 0 3 and 3 2 respectively table 3 this indicates that the probability distribution function of soil water tension had a strong symmetrical distribution tendency in the spring strong vegetation activity with root development was responsible for the negligible skewness in soil water tension during the spring 3 4 delineation of the relationship between soil moisture and soil water tension the relationships between soil moisture and soil water tension described as smccs can be obtained from field measurements depending on the selection of collected data in this study soil moisture measurements for the recession period and soil tension data for the drying period were used for the delineation of smccs identification of the wetting period during rainfall events was significantly restricted due to the uneven and complicated temporal distribution of rainfall events as well as complicated infiltration patterns such as matrix flow macropore flow and secondary flow in the field additionally the hysteresis of an smcc was not always apparent in the field conditions li et al 2005 rainfall events during the rainy season frequently occurred before soil moisture recession was complete therefore measurements for smccs were selected from both the spring and autumn the data used for smcc delineation were selected from recession periods with durations greater than 10 consecutive days from the end of a rainfall event the smccs for locations a2 a4 a5 and a8 during spring and autumn showed that maximum and minimum soil moisture were 6 3 and 26 8 respectively and that maximum and minimum soil tension were 770 6 and 1 6 cm h2o respectively fig 3 the distributions of the smccs were generally different depending on monitoring location on the hillslope depth and season as shown in fig 3 the starting and ending points of smccs differ and can be clustered depending on spatial and seasonal variations 3 5 water storage analysis to identify the contribution of flow path we performed water storage analysis of nine rainfall events at all points with smcc plots table 4 the storage of a designated point in table 4 was estimated using soil moisture by comparing the net amount of rainfall in each event to potential evapotranspiration with estimated canopy interception and water storage mm evaluated by the combination of soil moisture variations multiplied by corresponding soil depths the negative water storage in table 4 indicates that less water than the effective rainfall was stored for a specific event and positive values denote the opposite in other words positive storage values in table 4 indicate the contribution of additional flow mainly from upslope and lateral flow rather than the vertical flow positive water storage was usually found at a depth of 60 cm indicating lateral subsurface flow over the bedrock occasionally positive storage such as at point a2 60 was not connected to the downslope area in the spring resulting in negligible water being delivered to downslope locations such as a5 and a8 kim 2012 positive storage development in points such as a5 50 and a8 60 did not match expectations from high rainfall substantial positive storage was concentrated at downslope points such as a8 60 and a8 30 during the rainy season and extending into autumn the water storage distribution in table 4 indicates that lateral flow in the downslope direction tends to develop with a seasonally increasing trend between spring and autumn regardless of the total rainfall in each rainfall event 3 6 recession analysis of soil moisture and soil water tension the variation rates of soil moisture and soil water tension during the recession period are important for evaluating the contribution of hydrological flux after a rainfall event to obtain reliable estimates in recession analysis recession periods longer than 14 days without additional rainfall events were selected table 5 a and b present the variation rates of soil moisture and soil water tension respectively as fitted slopes of linear approximations for recession periods after rainfall during spring 05 25 06 12 the rainy season 07 02 07 15 and autumn 10 03 10 30 estimated r2 values between measurements and fitted slopes were higher for soil moisture 0 92 0 99 than for soil water tension 0 72 0 97 which indicates more complicated processes involved in the variation of soil water tension than those for soil moisture the soil moisture recession slopes during spring and the rainy season were more than two times steeper than those for autumn the fitted slopes for soil water tension during autumn were similar to those during spring and the rainy season seasonal variations in soil moisture could be explained by seasonal soil moisture determinants such as rainfall events and vegetation activity rather than static factors such as topography and soil 4 discussion 4 1 seasonal differences in smcc spring and autumn smccs for the most upslope point a2 30 are shown in fig 4 a both the range and variation of tension pressure and soil moisture differed between the two seasons the slope of the smcc dh d θ was steeper in autumn than in spring the milder slope of the smcc in spring fig 4 a can be explained by seasonal differences in soil pores due to increased vegetation activity during the spring iiyama 2016 fig 4 b presents the smccs for the middle slope point a4 30 during the spring and autumn the slopes of the smccs were similar between the two seasons and the seasonal difference for point a4 30 was reduced compared with those at upslope point a2 30 not only because soil moisture values at this point were generally high 15 26 for the entire monitoring period but also because of upslope lateral flow contribution at point a4 30 as shown in fig 2 and table 4 fig 4 c to f present the seasonal smccs at points a4 60 a5 30 a8 30 and a8 60 the smccs for point a5 30 upslope of a5 30 did show noticeable seasonal differences fig 4 d this occurred because of the different variation rates of soil moisture tables 5 a during the recession period between spring and autumn as shown in fig 4 e the smccs for the most downslope point a8 30 also showed higher soil tensions in autumn but soil moistures were distributed over higher ranges in autumn than were those in spring the greater upslope contribution area of point a8 30 table 1 can provide higher wetness table 4 and the seasonal difference in smccs at this point seemed more amplified than those at upslope points such as a5 30 and a4 30 smccs at deeper depths such as points a4 60 and a8 60 also showed seasonal differences figs 4 d 5 f unlike the case at the 30 cm depth the impact of seasonal differences on smccs at the 60 cm depth was reduced in the downslope direction the development of positive pressure at deeper depths tended to more apparent toward the downslope fig 5 shows variations in soil water pressure at the deepest points a5 80 and a8 90 which present lower responses and lower variation than the shallower or upslope points this occurred because a perched water level appeared during the rainy season at points a5 80 and a8 90 as shown in fig 5 negative pressure values were found starting in october and their variation patterns for the autumn dry season appear discrete which indicates that soil wetness was partially disconnected with an uneven time sequence discontinuity in pressure was also found in wet seasons which also indicates the instant development and disappearance of a water table the connectivity of soil moisture distribution may be strongly associated with the appearance of pipe flow uchida et al 2002 the smccs for autumn showed steeper slopes and higher tension than did those for spring except for the wetter smcc portion of the most upslope point a2 30 which has a negligible upslope contributing area table 1 the recession part of the soil moisture along the hillslope was strongly affected by inflow from the upslope after rainfall events and the degree of this difference also depended on soil depth and the formation of a temporal water table 4 2 spatial and profile differences in smcc fig 4 e c b and a depicting points a8 a5 a4 and a2 show smccs at the 30 cm depth from the downslope to the upslope direction smaller differences in seasonal smccs occurred with greater distance from the hillslope outlet because the impact of topography on upslope contributing area tended to be smaller in the upslope direction as shown in table 1 freer et al 2004 quinn et al 1991 in other words the hydrological flow paths that contribute to soil moisture become less complicated at upslope points than at downslope points as presented in fig 2 and table 4 a greater upslope contributing area for point a5 30 and the impact of a temporal water table on point a8 30 may explain the smccs of the two downslope points the crossing point of the smccs between the two seasons also demonstrated a notable spatial pattern from the upslope to the downslope direction as shown in fig 4 a e the crossing point of the seasonal smccs in soil moisture for the upslope point a2 30 was 8 whereas those values for the downslope points a5 30 and a8 30 were 14 and 25 respectively the seasonal crossing points of the smccs for tension pressure were 36 42 190 and 500 cm h2o for points a8 30 a5 30 a4 30 and a2 30 respectively which indicates that negative pressure tends to be more dominant at upslope points and its scale tends to be exponentially amplified in the upslope direction this means that distinct smcc features related to spatial distribution become more strongly associated with topography in the downslope direction the distribution characteristics in smccs were also significantly different in spring and autumn fig 3 the spatial distribution of smccs for the spring season can be categorized visually into three distinct parts upslope downslope and near the perched water table such as points a5 80 and a8 90 fig 5 however all smccs for autumn were completely different from one another and no clustering or characterization was possible as shown in fig 3 this is because the impact of vegetation and soil pore development in the spring introduced substantial similarity between adjacent smccs even with the more frequent rainfall in spring than in autumn this may also explain the more similar distribution of soil moisture pdfs for spring than those for other seasons table 2 the development of substantial tension at the deepest soil depths of the downslope area fig 5 in autumn probably disconnected soil wetness along the hillslope in other words the reduced spatial connectivity in smccs during autumn appears to be responsible for the completely separated smccs during the dry autumn season which can be associated with negligible spatial organization of soil moisture western et al 1999 fig 4 g and g present depth profiles of smccs at locations a4 and a8 respectively during the spring season soil tensions at the 60 cm depth increased to 150 and 240 cm h2o for locations a4 and a8 respectively whereas those for the 30 cm depth scaled up to 250 and 590 cm h2o respectively soil tensions in autumn at points a4 and a8 increased to 450 and 300 cm h2o at the 60 cm depth respectively although the seasonal difference in smccs was greater at the 60 cm depth than at the 30 cm depth at location a4 the case for location a8 was the opposite this occurred because location a4 showed high soil moisture at 30 cm and location a8 showed an apparent positive pressure at deeper depths fig 5 the smcc profiles along the hillslope appear to be significantly influenced by the development of a perched water table as well as by the vertical profile of soil moisture 4 3 model parameters for smcc both the bc and vg models were used to estimate model parameters for the smccs shown in fig 3 a heuristic approach was used to delineate the best parameter sets for each model for both spring and autumn tables 6 and 7 present the estimated parameters for the bc and the vg models respectively the parameters shown in tables 6 and 7 are different from the reference parameters for sandy loam given by carsel and parrish 1988 because of heterogeneous field conditions of pores roots temperature uneven rainfall and additional hydrological flux from the upslope the estimated parameters of θ s and θ r were similar for the two different seasons and models the estimated parameter λ for the bc model was smaller for spring than for autumn except for point a8 30 which was affected by the development of a suction profile from the water table a smaller estimated λ indicates a less uniform distribution of pore size in the soil matrix babu et al 2005 this suggests that pore size distribution in the spring was less uniform than that in autumn which can be explained by more active root development in the growing season lais in spring were between 2 98 and 3 97 but those in autumn were between 1 06 and 0 98 the estimated parameter α values for the vg model were smaller in spring than in autumn which means that the air entry values were higher in spring than in autumn the other estimated vg model parameter n values were also higher at most monitoring points in spring than in autumn because parameter n represents the slope of the smcc steeper slopes in autumn than in spring can be explained by a larger number of pores and a higher variability of pore size in spring 4 4 features of soil moisture and soil water tension relatively uniform distributions of soil moisture and soil water tension tables 2 and 3 were found in the spring season compared to other seasons which may be strongly associated with the development of vegetation in the growing season the spatial distribution of soil moisture and soil water tension at greater depths showed topological control cas and twis in table 1 to downslope which can be explained by the generation of subsurface lateral flow along the boundary between soil and bedrock the frequency analysis and storage analysis of soil moisture measurements not only showed seasonally different features but also revealed the transitional trend in soil moisture from spring to autumn table 2 and table 4 both the dominant pdfs and the distribution of delineated pdfs out of seven candidate pdfs were seasonally changed and the degree of lateral flow generation in deeper and downslope areas also changed from spring to autumn tables 2 and 4 irrespective of the amount of rainfall in spring and autumn table 3 the pattern of lateral flow development over the entire period significantly affected soil moisture redistribution and its pdf the exclusive appearance of lateral flow at the 60 cm depth and occasionally at the 30 cm were strongly associated with the increasing trend in soil moisture to downslope at the depths of 30 and 60 cm at the bedrock boundary fig 2 soil water tension statistics also indicated seasonal differences and the increasing development of high soil water tension from spring to autumn in upslope areas and the impact of heavy rainfall and lateral flow in downslope areas during the rainy season table 3 the pattern of variation rates in soil moisture and soil water tension after a rainfall event were also seasonally different while the soil moisture slopes were different in spring and autumn those for soil water tension were similar fig 4 a and b seasonally different soil moisture recession rates and transitional development of lateral flow were responsible for the spatial distribution of smcc intersections between spring and autumn along the hillslope fig 4 a f understanding the determinants of soil moisture is important to understanding seasonal differences in soil moisture redistribution topography is known to be a dominant factor in redistribution on hillslopes in humid climates anderson and kneale 1980 however the differences in soil properties and topography are negligible simply because these factors cannot change seasonally the impact of vegetation on hydrological processes varied seasonally in the study area lais were between 1 06 and 0 98 in november and between 2 98 and 3 97 in may considering that the root area index rai is proportional to the lai ng et al 2016 the feasibility of flow path development including both vertical and lateral flow is greater in spring than in autumn this indicates differences between evapotranspiration and between soil pore development in the two seasons additionally this explains the lower tension pressures in smccs during spring than those during autumn for similar soil moisture values the spatial distribution of the seasonal smccs also demonstrates that the lower amount and frequency of rainfall in autumn were compensated for in the downslope direction indicating that the impact of topography counteracts differences in rainfall and vegetation on the downslope area of a hillslope 5 conclusion the generation of water flow and water storage in a hillslope unsaturated zone was explored through field measurements of soil moisture and soil water potential at a steep hillslope both statistical and recessional analysis showed seasonal differences in hydrometric measurements lateral flow tended to develop from spring to autumn at deeper depths along the hillslope seasonally different pdf distribution for soil moisture can be explained by seasonally transitional hydrological processes which can be confirmed through analyses of water storage and recession slopes of soil moisture the recession period of soil moisture and the corresponding increases in soil tension were used to investigate the seasonal variation of smccs comparative analysis of smccs between spring and autumn implied the relative influence of topography and vegetation on soil moisture and tension the estimated parameters for the brooks and corey and van genuchten smcc models and lai measurements supported a distinct role of vegetation in terms of seasonal differences in soil pore development seasonally distinct hydrological processes and determinants of soil moisture introduced seasonal differences in smccs at most monitoring points seasonally differences in recession slopes of soil moisture were responsible for different smcc distributions in spring and autumn along the hillslope spatially different flow components including vertical and lateral flow and the temporal appearance of a water table in the rainy season determined spatial variations in smccs from the hilltop to downslope region seasonal variations in hillslope hydrological processes can be examined through several data analysis methods and smcc analysis provides another viewpoint for the characterization of seasonal changes in hillslope hydrology acknowledgements this work was supported by the basic research program through the

6841,understanding variations in soil moisture and soil water potential is important for describing hydrological processes at the hillslope scale an intensive field campaign to measure soil moisture soil water potential and rainfall events was performed at many locations and depths to obtain seasonal and spatial distributions of hydrometric measurements along steep hillslopes soil moisture and soil water tension analysis showed seasonally distinctive features in statistics and probability distributions the relationship between soil moisture and soil water tension was explored to characterize seasonal and spatial variations the recession slopes of soil moisture at several given points of the relationship were also seasonally different the brooks and corey model and the van genuchten model were used to estimate parameters for the measured data to explain the spatial and seasonal variations soil water storage analysis not only indicated that lateral flow tends to be abundant at greater depths but also revealed a seasonal trend in development of subsurface flow in the downslope direction the combined impact of topography and vegetation determined the seasonal

introduction soil moisture plays important roles in infiltration evapotranspiration and solute transport in the unsaturated zone and it is a key factor in plant growth and the dynamics of the ecosystem blume et al 2009 corradini 2014 feng et al 2012 rodriguez iturbe and porporato 2004 teuling et al 2010 at the hillslope scale soil moisture is an important hydrological attribute for hydrological processes including rainfall runoff and erosion processes antinoro et al 2017 haga et al 2005 kim 2009 nippen et al 2011 spatial and temporal distributions of soil moisture can be controlled by various environmental factors such as precipitation topography soil texture and vegetation gwak and kim 2017 liang et al 2014 nippen et al 2011 rosenbaum et al 2012 vereecken et al 2014 additionally spatial and temporal distributions of soil moisture and soil pressure result from mutual interactions between the vertical flow of unsaturated zones and the generation of lateral subsurface storm flows lepore et al 2013 tsutsumi et al 2005 uchida et al 2004 soil water tension is another important variable that determines water movement in the unsaturated zone a theoretical study of unsaturated flow generation was supported by field measurements of soil tension and field pressure measurements for two dimensional flow analysis harr 1977 weyman 1973 laboratory measurements indicated the role of subsurface topography in the formation of lateral downslope flow profiles based on the angles of subsurface boundaries sinai and dirksen 2006 the complicated hydrometeorological conditions and soil heterogeneity in field conditions result in a wide distribution of flow vectors in the three dimensional field which is more temporally dynamic and nonlinear than are laboratory simulations or numerical studies gwak et al 2017 lu et al 2011 lv et al 2013 the impact of soil tension on plant growth and yield as well as its relationship to both leaf and root area indices have also been studied alamilla magańa et al 2016 ng et al 2016 the relationship between soil moisture and soil tension is broadly described by soil moisture characteristic curves smccs which also indicate the available water for plants through the wilting point air entry value and residual water content along the curves smccs obtained from field monitoring and from laboratory measurements have been studied in the context of hysteresis and the slope of the curve considering the distribution of soil pores iiyama 2016 li et al 2005 morgan et al 2001 the determinants of soil moisture and soil water tension in a hillslope can be divided into steady state factors e g topography and soil and temporally varying factors e g rainfall and land use coleman and niemann 2012 hu and si 2014 huang et al 2016 penna et al 2009 zucco et al 2014 both soil moisture and soil water tension strongly depend on various hydrological processes such as infiltration exfiltration lateral flow and transpiration which have a strong seasonal feature therefore the impact of temporally varying hydro meteorological components e g rainfall and eco hydrological factors e g vegetation on soil moisture and soil water tension can be seasonally distinct the history of dynamic determinants can affect the response pattern of soil moisture and soil water tension to a given rainfall feature such as rainfall amount and intensity therefore the status of hydrological processes cannot be assumed to be static but is transitional from spring to autumn many studies have used hydrometric measurements to understand nonlinear hydrologic behavior at the hillslope scale anderson et al 2009 blume et al 2009 freer et al 2004 haga et al 2005 kim 2009 however soil moisture distribution analysis in such studies was performed through identification of probability density functions without consideration for seasonal context brocca et al 2007 romano et al 2018 vereecken et al 2014 therefore understanding seasonal differences in hydrometric measurements such as soil moisture and soil water tension can be useful in characterizing the impact of determinants of hydrological processes the transitional behavior of soil moisture can be characterized through seasonal identification of probability distribution functions and patterns of variation in soil moisture and soil water tension after rainfall events can be quantified through evaluation of recessions or increases in rates for the corresponding period furthermore the relationship between soil moisture and soil water potential in hillslopes soil depth and seasonal period can provide an alternative perspective for understanding hydrological processes in this study a time series of soil moisture and soil water potential was intensively collected at many locations and depths along a steep forested hillslope for more than seven months statistics frequency analysis recession rate storage analysis and the relationship between soil moisture and soil water tension were explored to address the following research questions 1 how can seasonal and spatial differences in soil moisture and soil water tension in steep forested hillslopes be characterized 2 how can the relationship between soil moisture and soil water tension be expressed in terms of spatial and seasonal differences and what hydrological determinants and processes influence this relationship 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the study area is a steep forested hillslope located in the sulmachun catchment in paju kyeongki province south korea fig 1 the sulmachun catchment has an area of approximately 8 5 km2 and is mainly covered by forest hydrometeorological data e g rainfall streamflow temperature and humidity data had been collected over the past 25 years at seven hydrological monitoring stations fig 1 the studied hillslope which is located in the headwater region of the sulmachun catchment has an area of approximately 4000 m2 an elevation of 200 260 m above sea level and surface slopes between 20 and 35 the bedrock underlying the hillslope consists of gneissic granite and fracture development is negligible the dominant soil type is leptosol but cambisol soil occurs at greater depths we collected 15 soil samples at all soil moisture monitoring locations for soil particle analysis and these samples indicated that the predominant soil textures according to the usda soil texture standard were sandy loam and loamy sand sand 67 0 9 1 silt 30 3 8 2 clay 2 7 8 2 table 1 presents fractions of soil composition at all monitoring points in the study area the mean bulk density of the soil samples was 1 36 g cm3 with a standard deviation of 0 057 and mean porosity of 48 the topographic features of the monitoring points such as local slope tanb topographic wetness index twi quinn et al 1991 and distance to stream ds are presented in table 1 the depth of the soil ranged from 25 to 95 cm and the depth of the root zone was approximately 20 30 cm generally soil became deeper with distance in the downslope direction vegetation within the study area consists of a mixture of polemoniales shrubby quercus and a coniferous canopy of pinus densiflora there was no difference in canopy density along the hillslope the leaf area indices lais measured using an lai 2000 device li cor biosciences 2004 varied between 0 98 and 1 06 for november and between 2 98 and 3 97 for may the mean annual rainfall for the previous five years was approximately 1636 mm with a standard deviation of 268 mm and 70 of the total rainfall occurred during the asian monsoon season between june and august the mean annual evaporation which was estimated by the eddy covariance method using data obtained from a flux tower 50 m from the study area was approximately 420 mm the temperature varied between 15 and 35 c 2 2 hydrometric measurements of the hillslope a tipping bucket rain gauge te525mm campbell scientific inc logan ut usa was installed in the middle of the hillslope and rainfall data were collected between april and november 2010 fig 1 the spatial distribution of soil water flow was evaluated under the assumption that soil water was governed primarily by the terrain of the humid mountainous hillslope anderson and kneale 1980 to address the spatial pattern of soil moisture redistribution in the monitoring network digital terrain analysis of the surface and subsurface digital elevation models dems were employed quinn et al 1991 wilson et al 2004 the locations of soil moisture sensors were determined based on wetness index distribution by addressing the frequency distribution of wetness index between high and low in almost identical interval along transects a points a1 a8 and b points b1 b8 and a downslope region c points c1 c3 fig 1 considering the soil depths in the study area and feasibility of waveguide insertion soil moisture data were collected at depths of 10 30 and 60 cm waveguides of time domain reflectometers tdrs were inserted horizontally in an upslope direction at depths of 10 30 and 60 cm while attempting to minimize disturbance of the soil matrix a buriable waveguide with a length and diameter of 20 cm and 0 3 cm respectively and a multiplex minitrase soil moisture equipment corp 2005 were used temporal variations in soil moisture content were recorded at bi hourly intervals between april and december 2010 to measure pressure variations in the soil layer a set of pressure measurement systems was installed at points a2 a4 a5 and a8 along the hillslope fig 1 due to uneven soil depths at these locations tensiometers were installed at two or three depths out of 30 50 60 80 or 90 cm according to feasibility of equipment installation at each location tensiometer rods soilmoisture equipment were installed in early april 2010 and soil tension data were obtained between the end of april and middle of november 2010 pressure transducers were connected three weeks after the initial installation to stabilize the potential field around the porous cups of the tensiometers to ensure stabilized pressure between the porous cups and the surrounding soil only data collected between may and november of 2010 were analyzed the gt3 15 and gt3 30 tensiometer transducers from ict international armidale au were able to detect pressure within the ranges of 100 to 0 kpa and 100 to 100 kpa respectively with a resolution of 0 1 kpa the soil water tension time series was obtained at 1 min intervals and moving averages of the measurements over 10 min intervals which is the appropriate sampling interval to capture the bypass flow were recorded by a data logger cr1000 campbell scientific inc the soil tension data were converted to bi hourly interval data through moving average to fit the relationship with soil moisture data the soil water storage for a point during a rainfall event can be evaluated through multiplication of the soil depth and the difference between the maximum soil moisture and the antecedent soil moisture the net rainfall amount can be calculated by subtracting the amount of canopy interception and potential evapotranspiration from the rainfall amount for a rainfall event the comparison between the net rainfall amount and soil water storage indicates how much the water from rainfall at the point contributes to the change in water storage 2 3 smcc models for parameter estimation the brooks and corey model bc model is a widely used equation for plotting the smcc the bc model can be expressed as follows 1 θ ψ h b λ ψ h b 2 θ 1 ψ h b where θ is the effective saturation and can is calculated by the equation θ θ θ r θ s θ r where θ is the volumetric moisture content and θ s and θ r are the saturated volumetric moisture content and residual volumetric moisture content respectively in eqs 1 and 2 ψ is the soil tension and h b and λ are fitting parameters the parameter h b is related to the air entry value of the soil and the parameter λ is related to the pore size distribution of the soil the van genuchten model vg model which can be an alternative to the bc model is the most widely adopted continuous smcc model that describes the entire smcc the vg model uses three fitting parameters namely n m and α using the relationship m 1 1 n the vg model can be expressed as follows 3 θ 1 1 α ψ n 1 1 n where α n and m are empirically fitted parameters the parameter α is related to the inverse of the air entry value the parameter n is related to the pore size distribution of the soil and the parameter m is related to the asymmetry of the model the vg model is complex and relies more on fitting parameters than do other models but it provides a better depiction of the smcc under most circumstances 3 results 3 1 statistics in soil moisture measurements fig 2 a shows a box plot of soil moisture statistics at a depth of 10 cm along transect a the average minimum and maximum soil moistures from point a1 10 to point a8 10 showed no notable trend in spatial distribution except for one exceptionally high soil moisture at point a6 10 the highest soil moistures at points a6 10 and a6 20 fig 2 a and b can be explained by smaller soil layer depth and quicker response than the others soil moisture statistics at 30 cm and 60 cm depths fig 2 b and c showed an increasing trend in minimum average and maximum values in the downslope direction aside from the points at the a5 location the discontinuity in the increasing trend between points at a4 and a5 in fig 2 b and the lower soil moisture variation of point a5 shown in fig 2 c can be explained by the discontinuity in soil moisture connectivity in the water transfer processes kim 2012 for this hillslope the low soil moisture of point a7 can also be explained by the relatively small contributing area ca for point a7 table 1 the low soil moisture at point a8 10 fig 2 a is associated with the substantial macropore development at surface of the downslope part no notable trend was observed in the variance of soil moisture along transect a soil moistures at the 10 cm depth along transect b also showed no notable trend in spatial distribution in the downslope direction fig 2 d the dominance in vertical flow in the upslope and mid slope of the study area can be explained by the lack of connectivity in soil moisture redistribution to the downslope at the 10 cm depth kim 2012 however soil moisture at depths of 30 and 60 cm along transect b fig 2 e and f showed an increasing trend toward the downslope direction substantial subsurface lateral flow could explain the higher wetness as the monitoring points were located closer to the end of the hillslope correlation analysis of the soil moisture measurements and soil or topography factors shown in table 1 indicates that the highest correlations were for twi to soil moisture at 30 cm depth r 0 67 and ds to soil moisture at 60 cm depth r 0 70 for the autumn season when the impact of topography is most pronounced to other controls such as rainfall and vegetation 3 2 probability density functions in soil moisture the characteristics of soil moisture distribution were further explored through frequency analysis probability distribution functions pdfs widely used in hydrological applications e g gumbel frechet weibull log pearson lognormal normal and gamma distributions were used through continuous fittings between measurements both the kolmogorov smirov test and the chi squared test were used to verify pdfs and the anderson darling test was employed to evaluate the goodness of fit gamage et al 2013 as presented in table 2 the best fitted pdfs for soil moisture datasets were the gumbel weibull and lognormal distributions which were dominant in the spring rainy and autumn seasons respectively relatively diverse distributions were found for the rainy season and extreme distributions tended to be delineated in the two dry seasons the degree of homogeneity in pdfs was stronger during the spring season than during other seasons and the skewness in pdfs was increased e g dominance in lognormal distributions during the autumn season the strong development of vegetation during the spring season may have neutralized the diversity in soil moisture pdfs 3 3 soil tension measurements a time series of soil water tension was collected at locations a2 a4 a5 and a8 at two or three depths depending on the depth of soil and the feasibility of measurement device installation the statistics of soil water tension measurements are presented in table 3 for three different seasons spring rainy and autumn the means of soil water tension cm h2o were between 15 7 and 69 3 in the spring and between 4 4 and 76 3 and 46 8 and 387 2 in the rainy season and in autumn respectively table 3 less spatial variation in soil water tension during the spring than during the rainy season can be explained by more frequent rainfall in the latter season substantially higher spatial variation in soil water tension during autumn than during spring was also observed coefficients of variation for the rainy season were also higher than those for spring and autumn especially at deeper and farther downslope points such as a5 80 and a8 90 high contributing areas cas and topographic wetness indices twis in table 1 where substantial lateral flow was expected the skewness of soil water tension in the spring was between 0 4 and 0 4 but those in the rainy season and autumn were between 0 5 and 2 4 and 0 3 and 3 2 respectively table 3 this indicates that the probability distribution function of soil water tension had a strong symmetrical distribution tendency in the spring strong vegetation activity with root development was responsible for the negligible skewness in soil water tension during the spring 3 4 delineation of the relationship between soil moisture and soil water tension the relationships between soil moisture and soil water tension described as smccs can be obtained from field measurements depending on the selection of collected data in this study soil moisture measurements for the recession period and soil tension data for the drying period were used for the delineation of smccs identification of the wetting period during rainfall events was significantly restricted due to the uneven and complicated temporal distribution of rainfall events as well as complicated infiltration patterns such as matrix flow macropore flow and secondary flow in the field additionally the hysteresis of an smcc was not always apparent in the field conditions li et al 2005 rainfall events during the rainy season frequently occurred before soil moisture recession was complete therefore measurements for smccs were selected from both the spring and autumn the data used for smcc delineation were selected from recession periods with durations greater than 10 consecutive days from the end of a rainfall event the smccs for locations a2 a4 a5 and a8 during spring and autumn showed that maximum and minimum soil moisture were 6 3 and 26 8 respectively and that maximum and minimum soil tension were 770 6 and 1 6 cm h2o respectively fig 3 the distributions of the smccs were generally different depending on monitoring location on the hillslope depth and season as shown in fig 3 the starting and ending points of smccs differ and can be clustered depending on spatial and seasonal variations 3 5 water storage analysis to identify the contribution of flow path we performed water storage analysis of nine rainfall events at all points with smcc plots table 4 the storage of a designated point in table 4 was estimated using soil moisture by comparing the net amount of rainfall in each event to potential evapotranspiration with estimated canopy interception and water storage mm evaluated by the combination of soil moisture variations multiplied by corresponding soil depths the negative water storage in table 4 indicates that less water than the effective rainfall was stored for a specific event and positive values denote the opposite in other words positive storage values in table 4 indicate the contribution of additional flow mainly from upslope and lateral flow rather than the vertical flow positive water storage was usually found at a depth of 60 cm indicating lateral subsurface flow over the bedrock occasionally positive storage such as at point a2 60 was not connected to the downslope area in the spring resulting in negligible water being delivered to downslope locations such as a5 and a8 kim 2012 positive storage development in points such as a5 50 and a8 60 did not match expectations from high rainfall substantial positive storage was concentrated at downslope points such as a8 60 and a8 30 during the rainy season and extending into autumn the water storage distribution in table 4 indicates that lateral flow in the downslope direction tends to develop with a seasonally increasing trend between spring and autumn regardless of the total rainfall in each rainfall event 3 6 recession analysis of soil moisture and soil water tension the variation rates of soil moisture and soil water tension during the recession period are important for evaluating the contribution of hydrological flux after a rainfall event to obtain reliable estimates in recession analysis recession periods longer than 14 days without additional rainfall events were selected table 5 a and b present the variation rates of soil moisture and soil water tension respectively as fitted slopes of linear approximations for recession periods after rainfall during spring 05 25 06 12 the rainy season 07 02 07 15 and autumn 10 03 10 30 estimated r2 values between measurements and fitted slopes were higher for soil moisture 0 92 0 99 than for soil water tension 0 72 0 97 which indicates more complicated processes involved in the variation of soil water tension than those for soil moisture the soil moisture recession slopes during spring and the rainy season were more than two times steeper than those for autumn the fitted slopes for soil water tension during autumn were similar to those during spring and the rainy season seasonal variations in soil moisture could be explained by seasonal soil moisture determinants such as rainfall events and vegetation activity rather than static factors such as topography and soil 4 discussion 4 1 seasonal differences in smcc spring and autumn smccs for the most upslope point a2 30 are shown in fig 4 a both the range and variation of tension pressure and soil moisture differed between the two seasons the slope of the smcc dh d θ was steeper in autumn than in spring the milder slope of the smcc in spring fig 4 a can be explained by seasonal differences in soil pores due to increased vegetation activity during the spring iiyama 2016 fig 4 b presents the smccs for the middle slope point a4 30 during the spring and autumn the slopes of the smccs were similar between the two seasons and the seasonal difference for point a4 30 was reduced compared with those at upslope point a2 30 not only because soil moisture values at this point were generally high 15 26 for the entire monitoring period but also because of upslope lateral flow contribution at point a4 30 as shown in fig 2 and table 4 fig 4 c to f present the seasonal smccs at points a4 60 a5 30 a8 30 and a8 60 the smccs for point a5 30 upslope of a5 30 did show noticeable seasonal differences fig 4 d this occurred because of the different variation rates of soil moisture tables 5 a during the recession period between spring and autumn as shown in fig 4 e the smccs for the most downslope point a8 30 also showed higher soil tensions in autumn but soil moistures were distributed over higher ranges in autumn than were those in spring the greater upslope contribution area of point a8 30 table 1 can provide higher wetness table 4 and the seasonal difference in smccs at this point seemed more amplified than those at upslope points such as a5 30 and a4 30 smccs at deeper depths such as points a4 60 and a8 60 also showed seasonal differences figs 4 d 5 f unlike the case at the 30 cm depth the impact of seasonal differences on smccs at the 60 cm depth was reduced in the downslope direction the development of positive pressure at deeper depths tended to more apparent toward the downslope fig 5 shows variations in soil water pressure at the deepest points a5 80 and a8 90 which present lower responses and lower variation than the shallower or upslope points this occurred because a perched water level appeared during the rainy season at points a5 80 and a8 90 as shown in fig 5 negative pressure values were found starting in october and their variation patterns for the autumn dry season appear discrete which indicates that soil wetness was partially disconnected with an uneven time sequence discontinuity in pressure was also found in wet seasons which also indicates the instant development and disappearance of a water table the connectivity of soil moisture distribution may be strongly associated with the appearance of pipe flow uchida et al 2002 the smccs for autumn showed steeper slopes and higher tension than did those for spring except for the wetter smcc portion of the most upslope point a2 30 which has a negligible upslope contributing area table 1 the recession part of the soil moisture along the hillslope was strongly affected by inflow from the upslope after rainfall events and the degree of this difference also depended on soil depth and the formation of a temporal water table 4 2 spatial and profile differences in smcc fig 4 e c b and a depicting points a8 a5 a4 and a2 show smccs at the 30 cm depth from the downslope to the upslope direction smaller differences in seasonal smccs occurred with greater distance from the hillslope outlet because the impact of topography on upslope contributing area tended to be smaller in the upslope direction as shown in table 1 freer et al 2004 quinn et al 1991 in other words the hydrological flow paths that contribute to soil moisture become less complicated at upslope points than at downslope points as presented in fig 2 and table 4 a greater upslope contributing area for point a5 30 and the impact of a temporal water table on point a8 30 may explain the smccs of the two downslope points the crossing point of the smccs between the two seasons also demonstrated a notable spatial pattern from the upslope to the downslope direction as shown in fig 4 a e the crossing point of the seasonal smccs in soil moisture for the upslope point a2 30 was 8 whereas those values for the downslope points a5 30 and a8 30 were 14 and 25 respectively the seasonal crossing points of the smccs for tension pressure were 36 42 190 and 500 cm h2o for points a8 30 a5 30 a4 30 and a2 30 respectively which indicates that negative pressure tends to be more dominant at upslope points and its scale tends to be exponentially amplified in the upslope direction this means that distinct smcc features related to spatial distribution become more strongly associated with topography in the downslope direction the distribution characteristics in smccs were also significantly different in spring and autumn fig 3 the spatial distribution of smccs for the spring season can be categorized visually into three distinct parts upslope downslope and near the perched water table such as points a5 80 and a8 90 fig 5 however all smccs for autumn were completely different from one another and no clustering or characterization was possible as shown in fig 3 this is because the impact of vegetation and soil pore development in the spring introduced substantial similarity between adjacent smccs even with the more frequent rainfall in spring than in autumn this may also explain the more similar distribution of soil moisture pdfs for spring than those for other seasons table 2 the development of substantial tension at the deepest soil depths of the downslope area fig 5 in autumn probably disconnected soil wetness along the hillslope in other words the reduced spatial connectivity in smccs during autumn appears to be responsible for the completely separated smccs during the dry autumn season which can be associated with negligible spatial organization of soil moisture western et al 1999 fig 4 g and g present depth profiles of smccs at locations a4 and a8 respectively during the spring season soil tensions at the 60 cm depth increased to 150 and 240 cm h2o for locations a4 and a8 respectively whereas those for the 30 cm depth scaled up to 250 and 590 cm h2o respectively soil tensions in autumn at points a4 and a8 increased to 450 and 300 cm h2o at the 60 cm depth respectively although the seasonal difference in smccs was greater at the 60 cm depth than at the 30 cm depth at location a4 the case for location a8 was the opposite this occurred because location a4 showed high soil moisture at 30 cm and location a8 showed an apparent positive pressure at deeper depths fig 5 the smcc profiles along the hillslope appear to be significantly influenced by the development of a perched water table as well as by the vertical profile of soil moisture 4 3 model parameters for smcc both the bc and vg models were used to estimate model parameters for the smccs shown in fig 3 a heuristic approach was used to delineate the best parameter sets for each model for both spring and autumn tables 6 and 7 present the estimated parameters for the bc and the vg models respectively the parameters shown in tables 6 and 7 are different from the reference parameters for sandy loam given by carsel and parrish 1988 because of heterogeneous field conditions of pores roots temperature uneven rainfall and additional hydrological flux from the upslope the estimated parameters of θ s and θ r were similar for the two different seasons and models the estimated parameter λ for the bc model was smaller for spring than for autumn except for point a8 30 which was affected by the development of a suction profile from the water table a smaller estimated λ indicates a less uniform distribution of pore size in the soil matrix babu et al 2005 this suggests that pore size distribution in the spring was less uniform than that in autumn which can be explained by more active root development in the growing season lais in spring were between 2 98 and 3 97 but those in autumn were between 1 06 and 0 98 the estimated parameter α values for the vg model were smaller in spring than in autumn which means that the air entry values were higher in spring than in autumn the other estimated vg model parameter n values were also higher at most monitoring points in spring than in autumn because parameter n represents the slope of the smcc steeper slopes in autumn than in spring can be explained by a larger number of pores and a higher variability of pore size in spring 4 4 features of soil moisture and soil water tension relatively uniform distributions of soil moisture and soil water tension tables 2 and 3 were found in the spring season compared to other seasons which may be strongly associated with the development of vegetation in the growing season the spatial distribution of soil moisture and soil water tension at greater depths showed topological control cas and twis in table 1 to downslope which can be explained by the generation of subsurface lateral flow along the boundary between soil and bedrock the frequency analysis and storage analysis of soil moisture measurements not only showed seasonally different features but also revealed the transitional trend in soil moisture from spring to autumn table 2 and table 4 both the dominant pdfs and the distribution of delineated pdfs out of seven candidate pdfs were seasonally changed and the degree of lateral flow generation in deeper and downslope areas also changed from spring to autumn tables 2 and 4 irrespective of the amount of rainfall in spring and autumn table 3 the pattern of lateral flow development over the entire period significantly affected soil moisture redistribution and its pdf the exclusive appearance of lateral flow at the 60 cm depth and occasionally at the 30 cm were strongly associated with the increasing trend in soil moisture to downslope at the depths of 30 and 60 cm at the bedrock boundary fig 2 soil water tension statistics also indicated seasonal differences and the increasing development of high soil water tension from spring to autumn in upslope areas and the impact of heavy rainfall and lateral flow in downslope areas during the rainy season table 3 the pattern of variation rates in soil moisture and soil water tension after a rainfall event were also seasonally different while the soil moisture slopes were different in spring and autumn those for soil water tension were similar fig 4 a and b seasonally different soil moisture recession rates and transitional development of lateral flow were responsible for the spatial distribution of smcc intersections between spring and autumn along the hillslope fig 4 a f understanding the determinants of soil moisture is important to understanding seasonal differences in soil moisture redistribution topography is known to be a dominant factor in redistribution on hillslopes in humid climates anderson and kneale 1980 however the differences in soil properties and topography are negligible simply because these factors cannot change seasonally the impact of vegetation on hydrological processes varied seasonally in the study area lais were between 1 06 and 0 98 in november and between 2 98 and 3 97 in may considering that the root area index rai is proportional to the lai ng et al 2016 the feasibility of flow path development including both vertical and lateral flow is greater in spring than in autumn this indicates differences between evapotranspiration and between soil pore development in the two seasons additionally this explains the lower tension pressures in smccs during spring than those during autumn for similar soil moisture values the spatial distribution of the seasonal smccs also demonstrates that the lower amount and frequency of rainfall in autumn were compensated for in the downslope direction indicating that the impact of topography counteracts differences in rainfall and vegetation on the downslope area of a hillslope 5 conclusion the generation of water flow and water storage in a hillslope unsaturated zone was explored through field measurements of soil moisture and soil water potential at a steep hillslope both statistical and recessional analysis showed seasonal differences in hydrometric measurements lateral flow tended to develop from spring to autumn at deeper depths along the hillslope seasonally different pdf distribution for soil moisture can be explained by seasonally transitional hydrological processes which can be confirmed through analyses of water storage and recession slopes of soil moisture the recession period of soil moisture and the corresponding increases in soil tension were used to investigate the seasonal variation of smccs comparative analysis of smccs between spring and autumn implied the relative influence of topography and vegetation on soil moisture and tension the estimated parameters for the brooks and corey and van genuchten smcc models and lai measurements supported a distinct role of vegetation in terms of seasonal differences in soil pore development seasonally distinct hydrological processes and determinants of soil moisture introduced seasonal differences in smccs at most monitoring points seasonally differences in recession slopes of soil moisture were responsible for different smcc distributions in spring and autumn along the hillslope spatially different flow components including vertical and lateral flow and the temporal appearance of a water table in the rainy season determined spatial variations in smccs from the hilltop to downslope region seasonal variations in hillslope hydrological processes can be examined through several data analysis methods and smcc analysis provides another viewpoint for the characterization of seasonal changes in hillslope hydrology acknowledgements this work was supported by the basic research program through the

6842,to better understand the biogeochemical processes of iron sulfur and phosphorus and their coupled relationships we used the in situ high resolution diffusive gradients in thin films dgt technique to characterize labile fe s and p in the sediment porewater of a mangrove coast in the jiulong river estuary china the distributions of dgt labile fe and s indicated that microbial sulfate reduction msr and microbial iron reduction mir exhibited an intense competitive relationship and temperature dependent behavior thus in addition to the expected msr mir is an important or even predominant biogeochemical process for organic matter om mineralization in this fe rich mangrove coast labile fe s and p distributions and variations demonstrate that fe redox cycling plays a crucial role in regulating p behavior and p cycling an additional new finding is that the flux of labile s in the intertidal zone increases during flood tides and decreases during ebb tides indicating that the formation and reoxidation of sulfide in surface layers are regulated by tide induced redox changes the net p flux associated with recirculated seawater was estimated to range from 0 306 0 001 to 0 343 0 013 mmol m 2 d 1 in the winter survey suggesting that sediment porewater tends to be a p source in the subtidal zone and a p sink in the intertidal zone for the overlying seawater in winter the continuous accumulation of labile p in surface sediment could be intensively released into the overlying seawater through prevailing mir process in the subsequent riverine flood season which may promote eutrophication of the adjacent xiamen bay keywords dgt iron reduction sulfate reduction fe s p coupling net p flux mangrove coast 1 introduction once particles are deposited as sediment early diagenesis associated with many biogeochemical processes occurs in the sediment and porewater the oxidation of organic matter om concerned with biotic activities in marine sediments is the energy source and driving force for these biogeochemical processes during early diagenesis rullkötter 2006 however unlike deep sea sediment coastal sediment accumulates om at high rates which fuels intense microbial activity consequently producing a quite confined oxygenated zone himmelheber et al 2008 under anaerobic conditions microbial sulfate reduction msr and iron reduction mir are regarded as major pathways of organic carbon mineralization and biogeochemical processes during early diagenesis which generally associated with nutrient activation ku et al 2008 kristensen et al 2011 sulfate reduction catalyzed by sulfate reducing bacteria srb has been reported to account for more than half of the organic carbon mineralization in marine sediments muyzer and stams 2008 and therefore represents a major component of s biogeochemical cycling al raei et al 2009 additionally given the ubiquity of fe hydr oxides in estuarine sediment microbial fe iii reduction has a strong impact on organic carbon mineralization moreover s and fe are necessary micronutrient elements to sustain life and redox cycling of these elements can affect aquatic plant growth especially in mangrove ecosystem johnston et al 2016 p is one of the major macronutrient elements required for life and is often the limiting factor for primary productivity in aquatic ecosystems benitez nelson 2000 lürling and van oosterhout 2013 sediment can act as a source or a sink of p for the overlying water column depending on the prevailing diagenetic process within the sediment porewater smith et al 2011 the exchange of p between sediment and porewater overlying water depends on fe redox cycling fe hydr oxide minerals are major repositories of phosphate as they can adsorb phosphate from porewater overlying water under oxic conditions but release phosphate into the porewater overlying water because of the reductive dissolution of the fe hydr oxides under anoxic conditions mortimer 1941 rydin 2000 jiang et al 2008 in intertidal sediments with high sulfide concentrations resulting from sulfate reduction the chemical iron reduction of fe iii oxyhydroxide phases can lead to the formation of fes theberge and luther 1997 fes molecules have a low point of zero charge and do not adsorb phosphate under neutral ph conditions bebie et al 1998 which effectively solubilizes originally fe detained p into the porewater and removes fe from the porewater moreover sulfate and fe reduction can also remobilize p via the decomposition of organic p ingall and jahnke 1997 thus fe sulfate reduction can predominantly control p cycling in surface sediment porewater wu et al 2017 rozan et al 2002 the processes of early diagenesis irrespective of whether microbiological redox reactions or predominantly abiotic reactions of dissolution and precipitation are involved are invariably reflected in the porewater of sediments rullkötter 2006 however our understanding of the behaviors of p fe and s and their relationships in coastal sediment porewater has been limited due to the lack of in situ high resolution sampling technologies conventional porewater extraction methods such as centrifugation and squeezing might be unreliable for the determination of redox active solutes due to artifacts associated with porewater mixing kankanamge et al 2017 moreover the high heterogeneity in coastal sediment requires high resolution sampling because numerous biogeochemical processes occur within very small spatial scales stockdale et al 2009 pagès et al 2011 centimeter scale resolution has been considered to be inadequate for studying biogeochemical processes widerlund and davison 2007 robertson et al 2009 because any steep concentration gradients within a section either vertical or horizontal will be averaged stockdale et al 2009 the diffusive gradients in thin films dgt technique a passive sampling method can overcome some of these issues by measuring labile p dissolved reactive phosphate labile fe dissolved ferrous iron fe2 and labile s dissolved sulfide i e h2s hs and s2 at a millimeter to submillimeter scale davison and zhang 1994 ding et al 2012 this technique in conjunction with the computer imaging densitometry cid technique has been applied to high resolution 2d measurements of labile s teasdale et al 1999 these dgt concentrations and fluxes of labile species such as easily changeable or mobile species reflect the bulk porewater solute and the supply from the solid phases to the porewater zhang and davison 1995 ding et al 2015 in practice the rate of release from the sediment can limit resupply resulting in the underestimation of the porewater concentration davison et al 2007 zro chelex dgt probes deployed in sediments have been further confirmed to be a powerful tool for the simultaneous measurement of cations and oxyanions in various environmental matrices including marine sediment wang et al 2017 in this study we utilized dgt devices to measure labile fe labile s and labile p and we also collected sediment cores to analyze the interaction between porewater and solid phase sediment based on high resolution measured porewater data fine scale depth concentration profiles were developed with 1d millimeter scale resolution for labile fe and labile p and 2d submillimeter scale resolution for labile s at different sites intertidal zone and subtidal zone and in different seasons summer and winter after analyzing the spatiotemporal variation characteristics of the fe s and p we assessed the competitive relationship between msr and mir for om mineralization the impact of fe s biogeochemical processes on p behavior the tide induced variations in s behavior and the implications of fe s p coupling for p cycling this work will contribute to the understanding of fe s p biogeochemical processes and their coupled mechanisms and will highlight the importance of internal p release absorption in mangrove and or muddy coasts 2 geochemical background 2 1 iron for fe species in natural sediment fe iii oxide fed composed of amorphous easily reducible fe feox and crystalline fe represents the fe pool for dissimilatory fe reduction rozan et al 2002 as an important indicator the ratio of fed total fe fet decreases with depth as sulfide concentrations increase via the formation of fes until the fed phases are completely exhausted canfield et al 1993 generally only highly reactive fe oxides i e feox have high specific surface areas and adsorption affinities that are sufficient for efficient p sequestration i e fe p of p species thus the preferential reduction of feox is a major control of p mobilization slomp et al 1996 moreover although commonly present at low concentrations chelated fe fep can enhance the efficiency of fe iii reduction through the influence of chelators and fe reducing bacteria are then able to access fe iii more easily dobbin et al 1995 dissolved fe ii is formed by mir eq 1 coupled with organic carbon oxidation or by chemical iron reduction cir eq 2 mainly via reaction with sulfide produced by sulfate reduction canfield 1989 1 424 f e o o h c h 2 o 106 n h 3 16 h 3 p o 4 756 h 106 h c o 3 16 n h 4

effectively accumulated rickard 2006 thus porewater fe ii is primarily derived from mir mir theoretically depends on the availability of fe iii hydr oxides and labile om in view of the sufficient om in estuaries and the weak migration of solid fe iii hydr oxides the availability of fe iii hydr oxides in the sediment is generally regarded as a major factor in the regulation of the mir rate and fe ii production rozan et al 2002 ku et al 2008 2 2 sulfur for s species in natural sediment total s ts is primarily composed of biogenic organic s and soluble sulfate in oxic near surface sediment while the ts content is generally high in anoxic sediment due to the production and accumulation of metal sulfides via continual sulfate reduction ku et al 2008 sulfide is formed by srb that catalyze msr coupled with organic carbon oxidation eq 3 or directly by om decomposition morse and luther 1999 in marine systems abundant sulfate and the low s contents in autogenic om enable msr to be the predominant process that produces sulfide in the form of dissolved s ii or solid metal sulfide 3 53 s o 4 2 c h 2 o 106 n h 3 16 h 3 p o 4 106 h c o 3 16 n h 4 53 h s h p o 4 2 39 h the msr process needs terminal electron acceptors sulfate and om unlike mir which is limited by the availability of solid fe hydr oxides dissolved sulfate can be inexhaustibly supplied from the overlying seawater hence the msr rate and s ii concentrations depend on only the labile om westrich and berner 1984 moreover srb are not completely anaerobic and msr can be fuelled by local enrichments of om even in oxic sediment bottrell et al 2009 pages et al 2014 2 3 phosphorus for p species in natural sediment we analyzed the aluminum iron minerals bound p fe al p and organic p op and ignored the residual p re p of the total p tp in general only op non refractory organics and fe bound p fe p appear to be involved in p regeneration with subsequent release to porewater and overlying water via the decomposition of om and reduction of solid fe oxides respectively ingall and jahnke 1997 mcmanus et al 1997 obviously p mobilization by both om decomposition and reductive dissolution of fe p are related to the geochemical behaviors of fe and s which need to be intensively investigated 3 materials and methods 3 1 study site the study site is located along a mangrove coast in the jiulong river estuary china fig 1 the study area has a subtropical marine climate with a mean annual air temperature of 21 0 c and a mean annual precipitation of 1371 mm liang et al 2013 the mean annual river runoff into the jiulong river is approximately 148 108 m3 70 of which occurs during the rainy season april to september runoff is generally highest in june and lowest from november to january yan et al 2012 the adjacent sea xiamen bay has a regular semidiurnal tide with a mean tidal range of 4 1 m and a maximum tidal range of over 6 m the muddy tidal flat is more than 40 m wide from the low tide mark to the edge of the mangrove the sediment particle size distribution indicates that the primary sediment type is clayey silt as measured in a previous study pan et al 2017 three sampling stations were established in our study as shown below fig 1 3 2 preparation of dgt probes a typical dgt device consists of a binding phase a diffusive layer and a membrane filter all of which are affixed to a plastic planar holder han et al 2015 the measuring principle and construction of dgt devices have been described in detail in previous study davison and zhang 1994 in this study we used zro chelex dgt probes to measure labile fe and labile p and agi dgt probes to measure labile s both zro chelex and agi dgt probes were provided by easy sensor ltd china www easysensor net each dgt binding phase was 30 cm long and 1 8 cm wide making these devices longer than conventional dgt probes to enable deeper measurements all dgt devices were soaked in deionized water and deoxygenated with nitrogen for at least 16 h and the agi dgt probes were stored in the dark prior to deployment 3 3 sampling sample collection was performed in june summer and december winter 2016 during the low tide period dgt devices were deployed at three stations j1 j2 and j3 along a transect perpendicular to the shoreline at each station zro chelex dgt and agi dgt probes were inserted into the sediment synchronously after being deployed for 24 h the dgt devices were removed from the sediment the surfaces of the probes were rinsed with deionized water and the probes were placed into plastic bags which were kept sealed until analysis during the deployment the overlying water was collected every 0 5 h from low tide to high tide for phosphate analysis after the dgt devices were removed sediment cores were collected at each station using pvc tubes with a diameter of 5 cm each undisturbed sediment core was immediately sectioned at 2 cm intervals for upper part of the core 0 10 cm and at 5 cm intervals for the remaining part of the core 10 30 cm these samples were then placed into sealed polyethylene bags and preserved at low temperature for laboratory analysis in addition the ph eh and temperature of each sediment core were measured immediately at 1 cm intervals using an automatic eh measuring instrument fja 6 developed based on depolarized methods by the institute of soil science chinese academy of sciences 3 4 sample analysis according to the analytical procedure and method described by xu et al 2013 the zro chelex probes were cut into narrow strips at regular 2 mm 0 10 cm or 5 mm 10 30 cm intervals using a set of ceramic knives to elute p and fe from the binding gels each strip was first eluted using a 1 0 mol l 1 naoh solution for analysis of p followed by flushing with deionized water the strip was then eluted using a 1 0 mol l 1 hno3 solution for analysis of fe the p and fe in the dgt eluate were determined using the molybdenum blue murphy and riley 1962 and phenanthroline colorimetric method tamura et al 1974 on an epoch microplate spectrophotometer bio tek instruments winooski vt to measure s the agi binding gels were immediately scanned using a flat bed scanner canon 5600f at a resolution of 600 dpi corresponding to a pixel size of 42 μm 42 μm the scanned images were then converted to grayscale density using the cid technique ding et al 2012 the gravimetric water content θg was measured through the weight loss of 5 g of sediment after it was dried at 70 c russell and voroney 1998 the method for phosphorus species tp ip op and fe al p in sediment developed under the frame of standard measurements and testing smt program of the european standard test committee ruban et al 2001 the contents of fet fed i e fe iii oxide and feox i e feooh in the sediment were measured using methods proposed by canfield 1989 and anschutz et al 1998 the content of fep chelated fe in the sediment was measured using methods recommended by lovley and woodward 1996 the total nitrogen tn total carbon tc total organic carbon toc and ts contents in the sediment were measured using an element analyzer vario el iii elementar germany phosphate concentrations in the overlying water were measured with a skalar san plus segmented flow analyzer skalar analytical bv breda the netherlands 3 5 data processing the accumulation masses of labile p and fe in the zro chelex binding gels can be calculated using eq 4 4 m c e v g v e f e where c e is the concentration of the labile p fe in the eluate v g and v e are the volume of the gel and eluate respectively and f e is the elution efficiency 88 8 1 05 for fe and 85 8 0 98 for p wang et al 2017 the fluxes fdgt of p fe measured by dgt and dgt labile p fe concentrations cdgt can be calculated using eqs 5 and 6 zhang and davison 1995 5 f dgt m at 6 c dgt m δ g dat where m is the corresponding accumulated mass of p fe over the diffusion time μg δ g is the thickness of the diffusive layer 0 9

spss ver 13 0 all the figures involving data were plotted using the software origin pro 9 0 and the other figures were plotted using the software coreldraw x6 3 6 uncertainty analysis and method validation the relative standard deviation rsd is used to determine the degree of statistical spread and therefore characterizes the precision of a method measurements of sediment parameters that rely on multiple artificial operations such as p species and fe species were performed with three replicates to assess their standard deviation to evaluate the accuracy of a method the relative error representing the variation from a certified value was also analyzed for the uncertainty analysis of p and fe the relative error derived from the elution efficiency f e was 14 2 and 11 2 respectively although higher than the relative error of zr oxide dgt probes for p 5 0 ding et al 2010 and chelex dgt probes for fe 11 1 wang et al 2016 the relative error of zro chelex dgt probes is acceptable considering the synchronous measurement of p and fe moreover the rsd of f e 1 18 for fe 1 14 for p and diffusion coefficient 0 78 for fe 0 44 for p discussed by wang et al 2017 2016 can be pooled as only 1 96 for fe and 1 58 for p via error propagation ensuring the precision of this method for s unlike the 1d slice to elute the solute with a degree of elution efficiency error the major uncertainty of the 2d labile s is derived from the calibration curve eq 7 of grayscale density versus accumulated mass as assessed by ding et al 2012 the observed good fit r2 0 98 for s ensures the reliability of the method and implies that this binding gel can be used to measure labile s at a high spatial resolution 4 results 4 1 sediment properties the integrated data of physicochemical characteristics in sediment cores at three sites during the summer js1 js2 and js3 and winter jw1 jw2 and jw3 are shown in tables s1 s6 while the average values for certain parameters are listed in table 1 figs 2 and 3 show the distributions of ph eh toc ts fe species fet fed feox and fep and p species op fe al p and re p i e the residual p with depth in the sediment cores the eh values generally decrease with depth from the surface and horizontally from station jw1 to jw2 to jw3 as expected the ph values also decrease with depth ranging from 8 15 to 8 90 the toc contents in summer with an average value of 1 40 ranging from 1 19 to 1 85 are higher than those in the winter with an average value of 1 02 ranging from 0 85 to 1 34 the toc contents in upper layers are generally higher than those in lower layers at all stations especially in winter the average toc tn value in the winter survey is 13 7 ranging from 9 5 to 17 6 indicating a predominantly terrigenous origin of the om milliman et al 1984 the ts contents in upper sediment layers remain constant at approximately 2 5 g kg 1 followed by a slight increase in summer and a distinct increase in winter as shown in fig 3 and table 1 the op contents as well as op tp are remarkably higher and more variable in summer mean value of 248 mg kg 1 than in winter mean value of 110 mg kg 1 while the ratio of the fe al p percentage of tp is markedly higher in winter mean values of 50 7 than in summer mean values of 29 8 the fe al p contents exhibit mean values of 218 mg kg 1 in winter and 206 mg kg 1 in summer the average values of the fet content differ little between summer 24 39 g kg 1 and winter 25 74 g kg 1 among these fe species only depth variations in the feox and fep contents are consistent in both summer and winter indicating that fep is primarily derived from reactive feox dobbin et al 1995 however although the feox content is generally higher in winter mean value of 9 12 g kg 1 than in summer mean value of 6 27 g kg 1 the fep content is considerably higher in winter mean value of 0 74 g kg 1 than in summer mean value of 0 19 g kg 1 the fed fet values exhibit an obvious decline in winter profiles but vary little with depth in summer 4 2 depth profiles of dgt labile fe and p the depth distributions of dgt labile fe and p at three sites during the summer js1 js2 and js3 and winter jw1 jw2 and jw3 are illustrated in fig 4 the average fluxes of labile fe throughout the profiles at stations js1 js2 js3 jw1 jw2 and jw3 were 31 60 pg cm 2 s 1 37 36 pg cm 2 s 1 19 63 pg cm 2 s 1 3 258 pg cm 2 s 1 8 348 pg cm 2 s 1 and 12 32 pg cm 2 s 1 respectively in addition to nonuniform vertical distributions within all the profiles fe fluxes were clearly higher in summer than in winter especially at stations j1 and j2 except for jw3 the fe fluxes were minimal in the upper several centimeters in the other five profiles fe fluxes increased rapidly with depth to peak values followed by different levels of fluctuations near the bottom of profiles fluxes displayed rapid or gradual decreases before reaching a steady state jw3 featured the highest fluxes 31 30 pg cm 2 s 1 at the surface immediately below the sediment water interface swi varying fluxes to minimum at 12 0 cm and a very slow increase to the profile bottom the average labile p fluxes throughout the profiles at stations js1 js2 js3 jw1 jw2 and jw3 were 4 452 pg cm 2 s 1 9 129 pg cm 2 s 1 7 168 pg cm 2 s 1 8 404 pg cm 2 s 1 9 659 pg cm 2 s 1 and 15 06 pg cm 2 s 1 respectively fig 4 unlike fe p fluxes were higher in winter than in summer the vertical distributions of p fluxes seemed to coincide with the fe distributions in the three profiles in summer nevertheless p fluxes in winter presented more diverse patterns than in summer and fe distributions in general the p fluxes were clearly higher in the deep layer from 15 cm depth to the bottom of the profile although the overall trend was somewhat in keeping with the fe at stations jw1 and jw3 at station jw2 after reaching a peak 14 73 pg cm 2 s 1 at a depth of 12 8 cm p fluxes remained high and fluctuated slightly to the bottom of the profile while the fe fluxes decreased throughout much of the profile and reached low values 4 3 depth profiles of dgt labile s fig 5 is a 2d image of dgt labile s in summer js1 js2 and js3 and winter jw1 jw2 and jw3 and fig s1 shows 1d depth profiles transformed from fig 5 the average labile s fluxes at station js1 js2 js3 jw1 jw2 and jw3 were 24 50 pg cm 2 s 1 20 88 pg cm 2 s 1 19 58 pg cm 2 s 1 16 10 pg cm 2 s 1 13 57 pg cm 2 s 1 and 5 275 pg cm 2 s 1 respectively overall labile s fluxes were higher in summer than in winter in summer high labile s fluxes occurred just below the swi to approximately 1 cm depth with irregular fluctuations suddenly decreased at 1 1 5 cm depth and then increased decreased or fluctuated to the bottom overall labile s fluxes in the images decrease vertically and the heterogeneity decreases horizontally from js1 to js2 to js3 in winter with increasing depth the low labile s fluxes in the uppermost layers markedly or slightly increased then decreased by the same amount followed by a slow decrease to the bottom in addition to lower concentrations labile s fluxes showed less heterogeneity and fluctuation in winter than in summer 5 discussion 5 1 biogeochemistry of fe and s and their seasonal variation 5 1 1 fe biogeochemistry and seasonal variation as shown in fig 4 labile fe fluxes were minimal in the oxic surface layer when om is mineralized predominantly via mir at a certain depth fe is rapidly released into the porewater through the reductive dissolution of fe iii hydr oxides canfield 1989 however a high fe layer was observed immediately below the swi at jw3 possibly due to strong resuspension this presence of resuspension processes is supported by observations of turbid water and low eh values fig 2 which might contribute to sustaining anoxic mir in the uppermost layer generally the mir rate gradually decreases as fe iii hydr oxides become depleted with depth westrich and berner 1984 but this pattern was not distinct in the present study previous studies have suggested that due to rapid burial conditions in coastal estuarine sediments labile fe oxides can become buried deeply before being reduced providing a pool for enhanced mir at various depths coleman et al 1993 mortimer et al 2011 therefore high mir rates and fe fluxes can occur at depth in a dynamic estuarine system however in anoxic fe reducing layers both fed and feox distributions generally do not conform to the fe distributions in this study while fep distribution matches the fe distribution especially at high values figs 3 and 4 due to the influence of chelators fep is more easily utilized by fe reducing bacteria dobbin et al 1995 although it is not a particularly attractive energy source because of its limited abundance less than 3 of the fet in this study thus we infer that fep is likely to have a positive influence on mir and fe distribution on the whole as shown in fig 4 the averaged fe fluxes are distinctly higher in summer with an average of 29 55 pg cm 2 s 1 than in winter with an average of 7 991 pg cm 2 s 1 while the fep and other fe hydr oxides content are higher in winter than in summer fig 3 the mir rate and fe fluxes have been reported to increase with temperature van bodegom and stams 1999 which means that the mir rate is highest in summer and lowest in winter considering the high content of fe hydr oxides in the sediment overall the relatively low fe fluxes in winter suggest that the large temperature difference between summer and winter 31 2 c in summer and 17 9 c in winter has a greater impact on mir and fe fluxes than does the presence of fe hydr oxides 5 1 2 s biogeochemistry and seasonal variation the layers of highly labile s fluxes just below the swi fig 5 combined with corresponding high toc content fig 2 illustrate that srb are not completely anaerobic and can sustain high concentrations of s in conjunction with local enrichments of om even in oxic sediments as previously reported bottrell et al 2009 pages et al 2014 additionally other highly labile s fluxes generally correspond to high toc contents although their overall trends are somewhat distinct the decrease in the average labile s fluxes from j1 to j2 to j3 is similar to the decrease in the toc content table 1 these phenomena show that om has a great impact on msr rate and s distribution direct fecal deposition and the death of fauna may be expected to cause particles of reactive om to be distributed unevenly in the sediment below the oxygen penetration depth these particles can be rapidly mineralized by srb to form small hotspots with highly labile s fluxes which are also called microniches stockdale et al 2009 on the basis of 2d images of labile s fluxes a small s microniche was converted into a 3d image fig 6 the s distribution around the microniche is clearly displayed in this image this visualization of a microniche with highly labile s fluxes which can be difficult to detect with conventional methods clearly reveals a highly heterogeneous distribution and highlights the high spatial resolution of the 2d dgt measurements the average labile s fluxes are higher in summer than in winter because the msr rate increases with temperature van bodegom and stams 1999 furthermore the average toc contents are also higher in summer than in winter and the decreases in the labile s fluxes in deep layers in winter are in accordance with the decreases in the toc contents fig 2 thus we speculate that toc content and temperature have considerable impacts on the spatial and temporal distribution of msr and s moreover the increased horizontal heterogeneity of labile s in summer might also result from the increased toc contents and higher temperatures 5 1 3 fe s relationship and interaction the mir and msr processes compete to serve as electron acceptors for oc mineralization gonzalez silva et al 2009 sulfate is a less energetically favorable terminal electron acceptor than fe iii thermodynamically however some srb can endure oxic conditions to utilize labile om for msr as discussed in section 5 1 2 msr is known to occur in the fe reducing zone resulting in the removal of fe from solution via precipitation westrich and berner 1984 canfield 1989 as shown in figs 4 and 5 high labile fe and s fluxes alternated with depth indicating pronounced competition between msr and mir the toc and reactive fe hydr oxides distributions which regulate msr and mir respectively favor mir in summer previous research also reported that a limited supply of om and an abundance of reactive fe in the rapidly deposited sediments appear to be responsible for promoting mir and effectively suppressing sulfide production kao et al 2004 in winter the remarkable decline in mir complicates this competition and mir may be more sensitive to and dependent on temperature than msr in short in addition to msr mir is considered an important or even predominant process for om mineralization kristensen et al 2011 especially in this fe rich mangrove coast in addition to the competition between mir and msr cir eq 2 occurs via reaction with the dissolved sulfide produced by msr canfield 1989 as an important indicator of cir the fed fet ratio decreases with depth through reaction with continuously produced dissolved sulfide forming fes until the fed phases are completely exhausted however fes generally does not accumulate in the surface layer due to reoxidation canfield et al 1993 in addition the ts content increases with depth in anoxic sediment due to the production and accumulation of metal sulfide ku et al 2008 as shown in fig 2 the contents of both fed fet and ts do not display apparent variations with depth in summer although the fluxes of both labile fe and s are high in the deep layers the production and accumulation of fes appears to occur in the initial stages the decrease in the fed fet ratio and the increase in the ts content with depth in winter clearly indicate that fe iii oxy hydroxide is consumed and that fes accumulates from summer to winter additionally pronounced om mineralization occurs as revealed by the decreased toc content with depth in winter however at station jw3 strong mir and weak msr occur causing fe to predominantly co precipitate with carbonate as indicated by the low ts content and the lowest toc tc value in deep layers fig 2 and tables s6 5 2 effect of fe s biogeochemistry on p 5 2 1 crucial control of fe biogeochemistry on p generally the redox of fe plays a primary role in the release or adsorption of p in sediments p is strongly adsorbed by amorphous fe iii oxy hydroxide in oxic surface sediment i e feox whereas it is desorbed and released into porewater following the reductive dissolution of fe iii to fe in anoxic sediments rydin 2000 mcmanus et al 1997 significant positive correlations existed between labile p and fe throughout the profile in summer fig 7 clearly supporting the primary mechanism of fe redox controlled p release in the sediments anschutz et al 1998 rozan et al 2002 ding et al 2016 in contrast these positive correlations receded in winter fig 7 labile p clearly increased relative to the reduced labile fe leading to lower dissolved fe p ratios the predominant fe p surface complexation ratio of feooh p is suggested to be 2 mol mol with a corresponding mass ratio of 3 6 w w tejedor tejedor and anderson 1990 based on the unsaturated adsorption state of fe iii oxy hydroxide indicated by the quite high fe p ratios in the sediment fig 3 the dissolved fe p ratio should be higher than 3 6 w w as revealed by general lake research ding et al 2016 a compilation of the data in the anoxic fe reducing layer shown in fig 8 revealed that the average labile fe p ratios were 3 7 in summer and 0 9 in winter the low value and broad fluctuation in the dissolved fe p ratio in winter appear to be abnormal the depressed labile fe can be explained by consumption with s and the lower temperature as discussed in sections 5 1 1 and 5 1 3 while the elevated labile p can likely be explained by fe detained p remobilization and op mineralization associated with mir and msr unlike the consumption of fe with s the released labile p only diffuses upwards without other obvious removal and hence accumulates continuously as a result positive correlations between p and fe gradually weaken from summer to winter thus the following question arises is the elevated labile p the result of fe detained p remobilization or om mineralization p release is commonly deemed to be related to fe bound p rather than om decomposition mcmanus et al 1997 due to the higher release efficiency of feooh p than om mineralization by mir and msr as shown in eq 1 and eq 3 however in recent studies the degradation of fresh om has been proven to enhance p efflux kraal et al 2015 pan et al 2017 in our study the ratio of fe al p to tp increased while the op tp values decreased from summer to winter as illustrated in section 4 1 thus some of the op appears to have decomposed and transformed into fe al p hence the process of p cycling in sediment and porewater from summer to winter should be as follows in summer p is released by mir consumption of fe al p and om mineralization consumption of op resulting in elevated labile p concentrations p then diffuses upwards due to the concentration gradient and is finally adsorbed by sufficient fe iii oxy hydroxide in oxic surface sediment forming fe al p again barring disturbances this process is continuous resulting in moderate fe al p enrichment in surface sediment and remarkable op consumption in entire sediment in this p cycle from summer to winter fe redox reactions assist in the transfer of p from fe al p and op to fe al p and labile p based on this pattern of p cycling the elevated labile p in winter is originally derived from om mineralization 5 2 2 indirect effect of s biogeochemistry on p in addition to activating p via om mineralization sulfate reduction to sulfide can limit fe concentrations in anoxic sediments through the formation of insoluble iron sulfide precipitates fes fes2 and thereby indirectly regulate p availability rozan et al 2002 because iron sulfide minerals have a low point of zero charge and do not adsorb phosphate at neutral ph bebie et al 1998 these iron sulfide reactions effectively solubilize original fe detained p which dissolves into the porewater and removes fe from the solution sulfide accumulation has been proven to enhance p release in anoxic sediments pagès et al 2011 ding et al 2012 based on the above findings the large increase in labile s in surface layers which is indicative of rapid msr appears to be accompanied by a parallel increase in labile p fluxes due to the cir dissolution driven release of p previously bound to fe iii oxy hydroxide however the labile p and s distributions do not show any accordance in any of the depth profiles figs 4 and 5 the absence of the expected relationship between labile s and p distributions might be explained by the following factors 1 little p was initially bound to fe iii oxy hydroxide 2 cir does not favor p bound fe iii oxy hydroxide 3 fe iii oxy hydroxide is sufficient to retain the p released via cir dissolution however fe bound p content is not deficient at any depth fig 3 therefore we consider that abundant active fe in sediment plays a crucial role in regulating p behavior and p cycling and weakens the effect of s redox cycling accordingly in other words cir does not favor p bound fe iii oxy hydroxide to the best of our knowledge this phenomenon has not been observed in previous chinese or international studies 5 3 tide induced variation in s behavior msr can be fueled by locally enriched om even in oxic sediments leading to local s enrichment bottrell et al 2009 pages et al 2014 however in view of the particular conditions of the intertidal zone the surface layers with high s fluxes in this study should be considered differently firstly in the case of high surface s fluxes in both summer and winter no pattern of decreased fed fet ratios and increased ts concentrations appeared in the sediment as expected therefore the s released by msr is not effectively accumulated as solid sulfide but is instead continuously reoxidized by other oxidants such as oxygen or nitrate hence this case may not be related to seasonal changes secondly eh values measured in winter during the low tide period reached 205 0 in the surface layers and were accompanied by high s at jw1 even if msr produces s it should be quickly reoxidized instead of accumulating to high levels throughout the layer hypoxia is likely to develop in surface sediments during flood tide whereas hyperoxic conditions dominate the surface sediment during ebb tide teasdale et al 1998 therefore we surmised that the high s concentrations observed in the surface layers were generated by high rates of msr during the flood tide period and were reoxidized during the ebb tide period to verify this assumption further sampling work was performed and agi dgt probes were deployed at the mid tide line of the intertidal zone during the flood tide period ft and the ebb tide period et in winter and next summer respectively fig 9 shows that in surface layer rapid production of s occurred during the flood tide period while this newly accumulated s was rapidly consumed during the ebb tide period despite diverse vertical variations between the summer and winter surveys therefore this outcome provides tangible evidence for the first time that the tidal cycle plays an important role in msr and s cycling in this mangrove coast the effect of the tidal cycle on msr and s cycling can further explain the phenomenon of high s and low p fluxes in surface layers cir released p can be detained by sufficiently abundant fe iii oxy hydroxide in surface sediment as discussed in section 5 2 2 with the ongoing consumption of fe iii oxy hydroxide by s however p will be continuously released and is difficult to re adsorb thus labile p should gradually increase nevertheless the temporary accumulation of s during flood tide consumes only a limited amount of fe iii oxy hydroxide to form fes and release p which is easily re adsorbed by residual fe iii oxy hydroxide during ebb tide the fes can be oxidized to fe iii oxy hydroxide again thereby sustaining a high retention capacity for p obviously in addition to om mineralization this tide induced s cycling has a substantial influence on fe redox cycling and indirectly controls the behavior of p 5 4 net p flux via submarine groundwater discharge in coastal regions recirculated seawater has been recognized as an important pathway for the transport of dissolved substances into coastal waters the tide is a major driving force of seawater recirculation and the overlying seawater seeps into sediments during flood tide and returns to the seawater during ebb tide burnett et al 2003 this advection process can cause the exchange of p between sediment porewater and overlying seawater a previous study in the jiulong river estuary reported that based on the mass balance of radium isotopes the flux of recirculated seawater was approximately 0 26 0 54 107 m3 d 1 in winter wang et al 2015 which is equivalent to 3 66 7 59 10 2 m3 m 2 d 1 to estimate the net p flux we must know the end member p concentrations in seawater and porewater because p concentrations in the overlying seawater were measured only in winter in our study we estimated the net p flux only in winter the continuous monitoring of p concentrations in the overlying seawater shows a clear decline from low tide to high tide fig s3 the overlying seawater penetrates into the surface sediment during flood tide therefore the end member concentrations of seawater should be calculated as the average p concentration of the overlying seawater from low tide to high tide i e 0 149 mg l 1 in winter the average p concentration of the uppermost 1 cm of sediment at each station was chosen as the end member value for the porewater i e 0 024 0 001 mg l 1 0 025 0 001 mg l 1 and 0 289 0 005 mg l 1 for jw1 jw2 and jw3 respectively thus it is easy to determine the p fluxes by multiplying the recirculated seawater flux by the concentration difference between end members which yields net p fluxes of 0 148 0 001 to 0 306 0 001 mmol m 2 d 1 in the intertidal zone jw1 and jw2 and 0 165 0 006 to 0 343 0 013 mmol m 2 d 1 in the subtidal zone jw3 this calculated result suggests that the porewater could be a p source for the overlying seawater in anoxic submerged regions and a p sink for the overlying seawater in oxic intertidal regions 5 5 implications of fe s p coupling for p cycling in this estuarine intertidal zone the potential impact of fe s p coupling on p cycling may be considerable especially under the influence of tidal cycles and seasonal changes as shown in the diagram in fig 10 a p accumulates in anoxic porewater via om mineralization and the release of fe p via mir and msr then steadily diffuses upwards because of the concentration gradient additionally p from the overlying seawater is imported by recirculated seawater during flood tide periods both types of p can be adsorbed by abundant fe iii oxy hydroxide in oxic sediments and precipitate as fe p during ebb tide periods an increase in the oxic depth and the presence of sufficiently abundant fe iii oxy hydroxide in the near surface sediment favor this adsorption process moreover tide induced fes reoxidation recovers the adsorption ability of fe iii oxy hydroxide hence this process leads to consistently low p concentrations in the uppermost porewater and this porewater p cannot be transported to the overlying water these processes proceed until winter as shown in fig 10b leading to solid reactive fe p enrichment in the near surface sediment and labile p accumulation in anoxic deep porewater under certain conditions anoxic and mir dominated conditions can form in the topmost sediment layer in winter such as at station jw3 on one hand fe iii oxy hydroxide is constantly consumed by intense mir which weakens the p detaining ability of fe iii oxy hydroxide on the other hand the p released by abundant fe p in the surface layer easily migrates to porewater this released p in surface porewater together with the high concentrations of p in deeper layers can then be substantially exported to the overlying seawater via recirculated seawater advection and molecular diffusion this process appears to be the release mechanism for porewater p in underwater environments in the subtidal zone the special situation discussed above does not appear to form readily at the stations jw1 and jw2 in the intertidal zone in winter nevertheless in the subsequent riverine flood season depicted in fig 10c the intertidal zone can be covered by deep and turbid water resulting in sustained low oxygen conditions additionally abundant riverine runoff limits the supply of sulfate for porewater from the overlying seawater which weakens the msr process due to the depletion of sulfate and enhances the terrigenous reactive fe input in the above two cases the mir process in the surface layer is enhanced and releases a large quantity of p into the overlying water over a short period of time to further validate our conclusions additional sampling was performed before april and after july the riverine flood season using the same dgt method in the subsequent year the dgt labile p fluxes in the depth profiles shown in fig 11 show pronounced removal after the riverine flood season providing direct proof of labile p remobilization and migration to the overlying seawater generally the red tides occurring in the adjacent xiamen bay in spring and summer are considered to be a consequence of the large input of p from the jiulong river yang et al 2012 based on the above discussion this hypothesis might not be complete because a large quantity of p released from the sediment and porewater during the flood season has been ignored we believe that the surface sediment in the intertidal zone that accumulates p is a potential p source for coastal water especially during the flood season and that its contribution to the p budget and eutrophication in the jiulong river estuary and adjacent xiamen bay cannot be ignored 6 conclusions the in situ high resolution measurement of porewater solutes via dgt provided insight into the biogeochemical cycles and interactions occurring within the studied mangrove coast the labile s and fe distributions exhibit an intense competitive relationship between msr and mir demonstrating that in addition to the expected msr processes mir is also an important or even predominant biogeochemical process for om mineralization in this fe rich mangrove coast in summer significantly positive correlations were found between labile p and fe throughout the depth profiles verifying the mechanism of fe redox controlled p release adsorption in sediments in winter however the weaker correlations between labile p and fe in deep anoxic porewater suggest continuous p accumulation via fe detained p remobilization and op mineralization caused by mir and msr our observation of labile s enrichment during flood tide and consumption during ebb tide in surface porewater documented for the first time provides valuable insight and indicates the rapid switching between the production and consumption of s within a tidal cycle furthermore this observation confirms that the tidal cycle plays a vital role in msr and s cycling the net p fluxes caused by the recirculated seawater in winter indicate that the porewater tends to be a source of p for the overlying seawater in the anoxic submerged region and to be a sink of p for the overlying seawater in the oxic intertidal zone in winter the continuous accumulation of labile p in the surface sediment of the intertidal zone must be released at some point our findings indicate that the accumulated p in the intertidal zone is rapidly released during the flood season in the subsequent spring or summer when an oxygen deficit most likely occurs and the mir process is likely highly dominant within the top layer of the sediment therefore a large quantity of p released to the costal ocean over a very short time may affect the nutrient structure and the aquatic ecosystem acknowledgments this work was supported by the national natural science foundation of china grant no

6842,to better understand the biogeochemical processes of iron sulfur and phosphorus and their coupled relationships we used the in situ high resolution diffusive gradients in thin films dgt technique to characterize labile fe s and p in the sediment porewater of a mangrove coast in the jiulong river estuary china the distributions of dgt labile fe and s indicated that microbial sulfate reduction msr and microbial iron reduction mir exhibited an intense competitive relationship and temperature dependent behavior thus in addition to the expected msr mir is an important or even predominant biogeochemical process for organic matter om mineralization in this fe rich mangrove coast labile fe s and p distributions and variations demonstrate that fe redox cycling plays a crucial role in regulating p behavior and p cycling an additional new finding is that the flux of labile s in the intertidal zone increases during flood tides and decreases during ebb tides indicating that the formation and reoxidation of sulfide in surface layers are regulated by tide induced redox changes the net p flux associated with recirculated seawater was estimated to range from 0 306 0 001 to 0 343 0 013 mmol m 2 d 1 in the winter survey suggesting that sediment porewater tends to be a p source in the subtidal zone and a p sink in the intertidal zone for the overlying seawater in winter the continuous accumulation of labile p in surface sediment could be intensively released into the overlying seawater through prevailing mir process in the subsequent riverine flood season which may

diagenesis associated with many biogeochemical processes occurs in the sediment and porewater the oxidation of organic matter om concerned with biotic activities in marine sediments is the energy source and driving force for these biogeochemical processes during early diagenesis rullkötter 2006 however unlike deep sea sediment coastal sediment accumulates om at high rates which fuels intense microbial activity consequently producing a quite confined oxygenated zone himmelheber et al 2008 under anaerobic conditions microbial sulfate reduction msr and iron reduction mir are regarded as major pathways of organic carbon mineralization and biogeochemical processes during early diagenesis which generally associated with nutrient activation ku et al 2008 kristensen et al 2011 sulfate reduction catalyzed by sulfate reducing bacteria srb has been reported to account for more than half of the organic carbon mineralization in marine sediments muyzer and stams 2008 and therefore represents a major component of s biogeochemical cycling al raei et al 2009 additionally given the ubiquity of fe hydr oxides in estuarine sediment microbial fe iii reduction has a strong impact on organic carbon mineralization moreover s and fe are necessary micronutrient elements to sustain life and redox cycling of these elements can affect aquatic plant growth especially in mangrove ecosystem johnston et al 2016 p is one of the major macronutrient elements required for life and is often the limiting factor for primary productivity in aquatic ecosystems benitez nelson 2000 lürling and van oosterhout 2013 sediment can act as a source or a sink of p for the overlying water column depending on the prevailing diagenetic process within the sediment porewater smith et al 2011 the exchange of p between sediment and porewater overlying water depends on fe redox cycling fe hydr oxide minerals are major repositories of phosphate as they can adsorb phosphate from porewater overlying water under oxic conditions but release phosphate into the porewater overlying water because of the reductive dissolution of the fe hydr oxides under anoxic conditions mortimer 1941 rydin 2000 jiang et al 2008 in intertidal sediments with high sulfide concentrations resulting from sulfate reduction the chemical iron reduction of fe iii oxyhydroxide phases can lead to the formation of fes theberge and luther 1997 fes molecules have a low point of zero charge and do not adsorb phosphate under neutral ph conditions bebie et al 1998 which effectively solubilizes originally fe detained p into the porewater and removes fe from the porewater moreover sulfate and fe reduction can also remobilize p via the decomposition of organic p ingall and jahnke 1997 thus fe sulfate reduction can predominantly control p cycling in surface sediment porewater wu et al 2017 rozan et al 2002 the processes of early diagenesis irrespective of whether microbiological redox reactions or predominantly abiotic reactions of dissolution and precipitation are involved are invariably reflected in the porewater of sediments rullkötter 2006 however our understanding of the behaviors of p fe and s and their relationships in coastal sediment porewater has been limited due to the lack of in situ high resolution sampling technologies conventional porewater extraction methods such as centrifugation and squeezing might be unreliable for the determination of redox active solutes due to artifacts associated with porewater mixing kankanamge et al 2017 moreover the high heterogeneity in coastal sediment requires high resolution sampling because numerous biogeochemical processes occur within very small spatial scales stockdale et al 2009 pagès et al 2011 centimeter scale resolution has been considered to be inadequate for studying biogeochemical processes widerlund and davison 2007 robertson et al 2009 because any steep concentration gradients within a section either vertical or horizontal will be averaged stockdale et al 2009 the diffusive gradients in thin films dgt technique a passive sampling method can overcome some of these issues by measuring labile p dissolved reactive phosphate labile fe dissolved ferrous iron fe2 and labile s dissolved sulfide i e h2s hs and s2 at a millimeter to submillimeter scale davison and zhang 1994 ding et al 2012 this technique in conjunction with the computer imaging densitometry cid technique has been applied to high resolution 2d measurements of labile s teasdale et al 1999 these dgt concentrations and fluxes of labile species such as easily changeable or mobile species reflect the bulk porewater solute and the supply from the solid phases to the porewater zhang and davison 1995 ding et al 2015 in practice the rate of release from the sediment can limit resupply resulting in the underestimation of the porewater concentration davison et al 2007 zro chelex dgt probes deployed in sediments have been further confirmed to be a powerful tool for the simultaneous measurement of cations and oxyanions in various environmental matrices including marine sediment wang et al 2017 in this study we utilized dgt devices to measure labile fe labile s and labile p and we also collected sediment cores to analyze the interaction between porewater and solid phase sediment based on high resolution measured porewater data fine scale depth concentration profiles were developed with 1d millimeter scale resolution for labile fe and labile p and 2d submillimeter scale resolution for labile s at different sites intertidal zone and subtidal zone and in different seasons summer and winter after analyzing the spatiotemporal variation characteristics of the fe s and p we assessed the competitive relationship between msr and mir for om mineralization the impact of fe s biogeochemical processes on p behavior the tide induced variations in s behavior and the implications of fe s p coupling for p cycling this work will contribute to the understanding of fe s p biogeochemical processes and their coupled mechanisms and will highlight the importance of internal p release absorption in mangrove and or muddy coasts 2 geochemical background 2 1 iron for fe species in natural sediment fe iii oxide fed composed of amorphous easily reducible fe feox and crystalline fe represents the fe pool for dissimilatory fe reduction rozan et al 2002 as an important indicator the ratio of fed total fe fet decreases with depth as sulfide concentrations increase via the formation of fes until the fed phases are completely exhausted canfield et al 1993 generally only highly reactive fe oxides i e feox have high specific surface areas and adsorption affinities that are sufficient for efficient p sequestration i e fe p of p species thus the preferential reduction of feox is a major control of p mobilization slomp et al 1996 moreover although commonly present at low concentrations chelated fe fep can enhance the efficiency of fe iii reduction through the influence of chelators and fe reducing bacteria are then able to access fe iii more easily dobbin et al 1995 dissolved fe ii is formed by mir eq 1 coupled with organic carbon

effectively accumulated rickard 2006 thus porewater fe ii is primarily derived from mir mir theoretically depends on the availability of fe iii hydr oxides and labile om in view of the sufficient om in estuaries and the weak migration of solid fe iii hydr oxides the availability of fe iii hydr oxides in the sediment is generally regarded as a major factor in the regulation of the mir rate and fe ii production rozan et al 2002 ku et al 2008 2 2 sulfur for s species in natural sediment total s ts is primarily composed of biogenic organic s and soluble sulfate in oxic near surface sediment while the ts content is generally high in anoxic sediment due to the production and accumulation of metal sulfides via continual sulfate reduction ku et al 2008 sulfide is formed by srb that catalyze msr coupled with organic carbon oxidation eq 3 or directly by om decomposition morse and luther 1999 in marine systems abundant sulfate and the low s contents in autogenic om enable msr to be the

hence the msr rate and s ii concentrations depend on only the labile om westrich and berner 1984 moreover srb are not completely anaerobic and msr can be fuelled by local enrichments of om even in oxic sediment bottrell et al 2009 pages et al 2014 2 3 phosphorus for p species in natural sediment we analyzed the aluminum iron minerals bound p fe al p and organic p op and ignored the residual p re p of the total p tp in general only op non refractory organics and fe bound p fe p appear to be involved in p regeneration with subsequent release to porewater and overlying water via the decomposition of om and reduction of solid fe oxides respectively ingall and jahnke 1997 mcmanus et al 1997 obviously p mobilization by both om decomposition and reductive dissolution of fe p are related to the geochemical behaviors of fe and s which need to be intensively investigated 3 materials and methods 3 1 study site the study site is located along a mangrove coast in the jiulong river

were established in our study as shown below fig 1 3 2 preparation of dgt probes a typical dgt device consists of a binding phase a diffusive layer and a membrane filter all of which are affixed to a plastic planar holder han et al 2015 the measuring principle and construction of dgt devices have been described in detail in previous study davison and zhang 1994 in this study we used zro chelex dgt probes to measure labile fe and labile p and agi dgt probes to measure labile s both zro chelex and agi dgt probes were provided by easy sensor ltd china www easysensor net each dgt binding phase was 30 cm long and 1 8 cm wide making these devices longer than conventional dgt probes to enable deeper measurements all dgt devices were soaked in deionized water and deoxygenated with nitrogen for at least 16 h and the agi dgt probes were stored in the dark prior to deployment 3 3 sampling sample collection was performed in june summer and december winter 2016 during the low tide period dgt devices were deployed at three stations j1 j2 and j3 along a transect perpendicular to the shoreline at each station zro chelex dgt and agi dgt probes were inserted into the sediment synchronously after being deployed for 24 h the dgt devices were removed from the sediment the surfaces of the probes were rinsed with deionized water and the probes were placed into plastic bags which were kept sealed until analysis during the deployment the overlying water was collected every 0 5 h from low tide to high tide for phosphate analysis after the dgt devices were removed sediment cores were collected at each station using pvc tubes with a diameter of 5 cm each undisturbed sediment core was immediately sectioned at 2 cm intervals for upper part of the core 0 10 cm and at 5 cm intervals for the remaining part of the core 10 30 cm these samples were then placed into sealed polyethylene bags and preserved at low temperature for laboratory analysis in addition the ph eh and temperature of each sediment core were measured immediately at 1 cm intervals using an automatic eh measuring instrument fja 6 developed based on depolarized methods by the institute of soil science chinese academy of sciences 3 4 sample analysis according to the analytical procedure and method described by xu et al 2013 the zro chelex probes were cut into narrow strips at regular 2 mm 0 10 cm or 5 mm 10 30 cm intervals using a set of ceramic knives to elute p and fe from the binding gels each strip was first eluted using a 1 0 mol l 1 naoh solution for analysis of p followed by flushing with deionized water the strip was then eluted using a 1 0 mol l 1 hno3 solution for analysis of fe the p and fe in the dgt eluate were determined using the molybdenum blue murphy and riley 1962 and phenanthroline colorimetric method tamura et al 1974 on an epoch microplate spectrophotometer bio tek instruments winooski vt to measure s the agi binding gels were immediately scanned using a flat bed scanner canon 5600f at a resolution of 600 dpi corresponding to a pixel size of 42 μm 42 μm the scanned images were then converted to grayscale density using the cid technique ding et al 2012 the

validation the relative standard deviation rsd is used to determine the degree of statistical spread and therefore characterizes the precision of a method measurements of sediment parameters that rely on multiple artificial operations such as p species and fe species were performed with three replicates to assess their standard deviation to evaluate the accuracy of a method the relative error representing the variation from a certified value was also analyzed for the uncertainty analysis of p and fe the relative error derived from the elution efficiency f e was 14 2 and 11 2 respectively although higher than the relative error of zr oxide dgt probes for p 5 0 ding et al 2010 and chelex dgt probes for fe 11 1 wang et al 2016 the relative error of zro chelex dgt probes is acceptable considering the synchronous measurement of p and fe moreover the rsd of f e 1 18 for fe 1 14 for p and diffusion coefficient 0 78 for fe 0 44 for p discussed by wang et al 2017 2016 can be pooled as only 1 96 for fe and 1 58 for p via error propagation ensuring the precision of this method for s unlike the 1d slice to elute the solute with a degree of elution efficiency error the major uncertainty of the 2d labile s is derived from the calibration curve eq 7 of grayscale density versus accumulated mass as assessed by ding et al 2012 the observed good fit r2 0 98 for s ensures the reliability of the method and implies that this binding gel can be used to measure labile s at a high spatial resolution 4 results 4 1 sediment properties the integrated data of physicochemical characteristics in sediment cores at three sites during the summer js1 js2 and js3 and winter jw1 jw2 and jw3 are shown in tables s1 s6 while the average values for certain parameters are listed in table 1 figs 2 and 3 show the distributions of ph eh toc ts fe species fet fed feox and fep and p species op fe al p and re p i e the residual p with depth in the sediment cores the eh values generally decrease with depth from the surface and horizontally from station jw1 to jw2 to jw3 as expected the ph values also decrease with depth ranging from 8 15 to 8 90 the toc contents in summer with an average value of 1 40 ranging from 1 19 to 1 85 are higher than those in the winter with an average value of 1 02 ranging from 0 85 to 1 34 the toc contents in upper layers are generally higher than those in lower layers at all stations especially in winter the average toc tn value in the winter survey is 13 7 ranging from 9 5 to 17 6 indicating a predominantly terrigenous origin of the om milliman et al 1984 the ts contents in upper sediment layers remain constant at approximately 2 5 g kg 1 followed by a slight increase in summer and a distinct increase in winter as shown in fig 3 and table 1 the op contents as well as op tp are remarkably higher and more variable in summer mean value of 248 mg kg 1 than in winter mean value of 110 mg kg 1 while the ratio of the fe al p percentage of tp is markedly higher in winter mean values of 50 7 than in summer mean values of 29 8 the fe al p contents exhibit mean values of 218 mg kg 1 in winter and 206 mg kg 1 in summer the average values of the fet content differ little between summer 24 39 g kg 1 and winter 25 74 g kg 1 among these fe species only depth variations in the feox and fep contents are consistent in both summer and winter indicating that fep is primarily derived from reactive feox dobbin et al 1995 however although the feox content is generally higher in winter mean value of 9 12 g kg 1 than in summer mean value of 6 27 g kg 1 the fep content is considerably higher in winter mean value of 0 74 g kg 1 than in summer mean value of 0 19 g kg 1 the fed fet values exhibit an obvious decline in winter profiles but vary little with depth in summer 4 2 depth profiles of dgt labile fe and p the depth distributions of dgt labile fe and p at three sites during the summer js1 js2 and js3 and winter jw1 jw2 and jw3 are illustrated in fig 4 the average fluxes of labile fe throughout the profiles at stations js1 js2 js3 jw1 jw2 and jw3 were 31 60 pg cm 2 s 1 37 36 pg cm 2 s 1 19 63 pg cm 2 s 1 3 258 pg cm 2 s 1 8 348 pg cm 2 s 1 and 12 32 pg cm 2 s 1 respectively in addition to nonuniform vertical distributions within all the profiles fe fluxes were clearly higher in summer than in winter especially at stations j1 and j2 except for jw3 the fe fluxes were minimal in the upper several centimeters in the other five profiles fe fluxes increased rapidly with depth to peak values followed by different levels of fluctuations near the bottom of profiles fluxes displayed rapid or gradual decreases before reaching a steady state jw3 featured the highest fluxes 31 30 pg cm 2 s 1 at the surface immediately below the sediment water interface swi varying fluxes to minimum at 12 0 cm and a very slow increase to the profile bottom the average labile p fluxes throughout the profiles at stations js1 js2 js3 jw1 jw2 and jw3 were 4 452 pg cm 2 s 1 9 129 pg cm 2 s 1 7 168 pg cm 2 s 1 8 404 pg cm 2 s 1 9 659 pg cm 2 s 1 and 15 06 pg cm 2 s 1 respectively fig 4 unlike fe p fluxes were higher in winter than in summer the vertical distributions of p fluxes seemed to coincide with the fe distributions in the three profiles in summer nevertheless p fluxes in winter presented more diverse patterns than in summer and fe distributions in general the p fluxes were clearly higher in the deep layer from 15 cm depth to the bottom of the profile although the overall trend was somewhat in keeping with the fe at stations jw1 and jw3 at station jw2 after reaching a peak 14 73 pg cm 2 s 1 at a depth of 12 8 cm p fluxes remained high and fluctuated slightly to the bottom of the profile while the fe fluxes decreased throughout much of the profile and reached low values 4 3 depth profiles of dgt labile s fig 5 is a 2d image of dgt labile s in summer js1 js2 and js3 and winter jw1 jw2 and jw3 and fig s1 shows 1d depth profiles transformed from fig 5 the average labile s fluxes at station js1 js2 js3 jw1 jw2 and jw3 were 24 50 pg cm 2 s 1 20 88 pg cm 2 s 1 19 58 pg cm 2 s 1 16 10 pg cm 2 s 1 13 57 pg cm 2 s 1 and 5 275 pg cm 2 s 1 respectively overall labile s fluxes were higher in summer than in winter in summer high labile s fluxes occurred just below the swi to approximately 1 cm depth with irregular fluctuations suddenly decreased at 1 1 5 cm depth and then increased decreased or fluctuated to the bottom overall labile s fluxes in the images decrease vertically and the heterogeneity decreases horizontally from js1 to js2 to js3 in winter with increasing depth the low labile s fluxes in the uppermost layers markedly or slightly increased then decreased by the same amount followed by a slow decrease to the bottom in addition to lower concentrations labile s fluxes showed less heterogeneity and fluctuation in winter than in summer 5 discussion 5 1 biogeochemistry of fe and s and their seasonal variation 5 1 1 fe biogeochemistry and seasonal variation as shown in fig 4 labile fe fluxes were minimal in the oxic surface layer when om is mineralized predominantly via mir at a certain depth fe is rapidly released into the porewater through the reductive dissolution of fe iii hydr oxides canfield 1989 however a high fe layer was observed immediately below the swi at jw3 possibly due to strong resuspension this presence of resuspension processes is supported by observations of turbid water and low eh values fig 2 which might contribute to sustaining anoxic mir in the uppermost layer generally the mir rate gradually decreases as fe iii hydr oxides become depleted with depth westrich and berner 1984 but this pattern was not distinct in the present study previous studies have suggested that due to rapid burial conditions in coastal estuarine sediments labile fe oxides can become buried deeply before being reduced providing a pool for enhanced mir at various depths coleman et al 1993 mortimer et al 2011 therefore high mir rates and fe fluxes can occur at depth in a dynamic estuarine system however in anoxic fe reducing layers both fed and feox distributions generally do not conform to the fe distributions in this study while fep distribution matches the fe distribution especially at high values figs 3 and 4 due to the influence of chelators fep is more easily utilized by fe reducing bacteria dobbin et al 1995 although it is not a particularly attractive energy source because of its limited abundance less than 3 of the fet in this study thus we infer that fep is likely to have a positive influence on mir and fe distribution on the whole as shown in fig 4 the averaged fe fluxes are distinctly higher in summer with an average of 29 55 pg cm 2 s 1 than in winter with an average of 7 991 pg cm 2 s 1 while the fep and other fe hydr oxides content are higher in winter than in summer fig 3 the mir rate and fe fluxes have been reported to increase with temperature van bodegom and stams 1999 which means that the mir rate is highest in summer and lowest in winter considering the high content of fe hydr oxides in the sediment overall the relatively low fe fluxes in winter suggest that the large temperature difference between summer and winter 31 2 c in summer and 17 9 c in winter has a greater impact on mir and fe fluxes than does the presence of fe hydr oxides 5 1 2 s biogeochemistry and seasonal variation the layers of highly labile s fluxes just below the swi fig 5 combined with corresponding high toc content fig 2 illustrate that srb are not completely anaerobic and can sustain high concentrations of s in conjunction with local enrichments of om even in oxic sediments as previously reported bottrell et al 2009 pages et al 2014 additionally other highly labile s fluxes generally correspond to high toc contents although their overall trends are somewhat distinct the decrease in the average labile s fluxes from j1 to j2 to j3 is similar to the decrease in the toc content table 1 these phenomena show that om has a great impact on msr rate and s distribution direct fecal deposition and the death of fauna may be expected to cause particles of reactive om to be distributed unevenly in the sediment below the oxygen penetration depth these particles can be rapidly mineralized by srb to form small hotspots with highly labile s fluxes which are also called microniches stockdale et al 2009 on the basis of 2d images of labile s fluxes a small s microniche was converted into a 3d image fig 6 the s distribution around the microniche is clearly displayed in this image this visualization of a microniche with highly labile s fluxes which can be difficult to detect with conventional methods clearly reveals a highly heterogeneous distribution and highlights the high spatial resolution of the 2d dgt measurements the average labile s fluxes are higher in summer than in winter because the msr rate increases with temperature van bodegom and stams 1999 furthermore the average toc contents are also higher in summer than in winter and the decreases in the labile s fluxes in deep layers in winter are in accordance with the decreases in the toc contents fig 2 thus we speculate that toc content and temperature have considerable impacts on the spatial and temporal distribution of msr and s moreover the increased horizontal heterogeneity of labile s in summer might also result from the increased toc contents and higher temperatures 5 1 3 fe s relationship and interaction the mir and msr processes compete to serve as electron acceptors for oc mineralization gonzalez silva et al 2009 sulfate is a less energetically favorable terminal electron acceptor than fe iii thermodynamically however some srb can endure oxic conditions to utilize labile om for msr as discussed in section 5 1 2 msr is known to occur in the fe reducing zone resulting in the removal of fe from solution via precipitation westrich and berner 1984 canfield 1989 as shown in figs 4 and 5 high labile fe and s fluxes alternated with depth indicating pronounced competition between msr and mir the toc and reactive fe hydr oxides distributions which regulate msr and mir respectively favor mir in summer previous research also reported that a limited supply of om and an abundance of reactive fe in the rapidly deposited sediments appear to be responsible for promoting mir and effectively suppressing sulfide production kao et al 2004 in winter the remarkable decline in mir complicates this competition and mir may be more sensitive to and dependent on temperature than msr in short in addition to msr mir is considered an important or even predominant process for om mineralization kristensen et al 2011 especially in this fe rich mangrove coast in addition to the competition between mir and msr cir eq 2 occurs via reaction with the dissolved sulfide produced by msr canfield 1989 as an important indicator of cir the fed fet ratio decreases with depth through reaction with continuously produced dissolved sulfide forming fes until the fed phases are completely exhausted however fes generally does not accumulate in the surface layer due to reoxidation canfield et al 1993 in addition the ts content increases with depth in anoxic sediment due to the production and accumulation of metal sulfide ku et al 2008 as shown in fig 2 the contents of both fed fet and ts do not display apparent variations with depth in summer although the fluxes of both labile fe and s are high in the deep layers the production and accumulation of fes appears to occur in the initial stages the decrease in the fed fet ratio and the increase in the ts content with depth in winter clearly indicate that fe iii oxy hydroxide is consumed and that fes accumulates from summer to winter additionally pronounced om mineralization occurs as revealed by the decreased toc content with depth in winter however at station jw3 strong mir and weak msr occur causing fe to predominantly co precipitate with carbonate as indicated by the low ts content and the lowest toc tc value in deep layers fig 2 and tables s6 5 2 effect of fe s biogeochemistry on p 5 2 1 crucial control of fe biogeochemistry on p generally the redox of fe plays a primary role in the release or adsorption of p in sediments p is strongly adsorbed by amorphous fe iii oxy hydroxide in oxic surface sediment i e feox whereas it is desorbed and released into porewater following the reductive dissolution of fe iii to fe in anoxic sediments rydin 2000 mcmanus et al 1997 significant positive correlations existed between labile p and fe throughout the profile in summer fig 7 clearly supporting the primary mechanism of fe redox controlled p release in the sediments anschutz et al 1998 rozan et al 2002 ding et al 2016 in contrast these positive correlations receded in winter fig 7 labile p clearly increased relative to the reduced labile fe leading to lower dissolved fe p ratios the predominant fe p surface complexation ratio of feooh p is suggested to be 2 mol mol with a corresponding mass ratio of 3 6 w w tejedor tejedor and anderson 1990 based on the unsaturated adsorption state of fe iii oxy hydroxide indicated by the quite high fe p ratios in the sediment fig 3 the dissolved fe p ratio should be higher than 3 6 w w as revealed by general lake research ding et al 2016 a compilation of the data in the anoxic fe reducing layer shown in fig 8 revealed that the average labile fe p ratios were 3 7 in summer and 0 9 in winter the low value and broad fluctuation in the dissolved fe p ratio in winter appear to be abnormal the depressed labile fe can be explained by consumption with s and the lower temperature as discussed in sections 5 1 1 and 5 1 3 while the elevated labile p can likely be explained by fe detained p remobilization and op mineralization associated with mir and msr unlike the consumption of fe with s the released labile p only diffuses upwards without other obvious removal and hence accumulates continuously as a result positive correlations between p and fe gradually weaken from summer to winter thus the following question arises is the elevated labile p the result of fe detained p remobilization or om mineralization p release is commonly deemed to be related to fe bound p rather than om decomposition mcmanus et al 1997 due to the higher release efficiency of feooh p than om mineralization by mir and msr as shown in eq 1 and eq 3 however in recent studies the degradation of fresh om has been proven to enhance p efflux kraal et al 2015 pan et al 2017 in our study the ratio of fe al p to tp increased while the op tp values decreased from summer to winter as illustrated in section 4 1 thus some of the op appears to have decomposed and transformed into fe al p hence the process of p cycling in sediment and porewater from summer to winter should be as follows in summer p is released by mir consumption of fe al p and om mineralization consumption of op resulting in elevated labile p concentrations p then diffuses upwards due to the concentration gradient and is finally adsorbed by sufficient fe iii oxy hydroxide in oxic surface sediment forming fe al p again barring disturbances this process is continuous resulting in moderate fe al p enrichment in surface sediment and remarkable op consumption in entire sediment in this p cycle from summer to winter fe redox reactions assist in the transfer of p from fe al p and op to fe al p and labile p based on this pattern of p cycling the elevated labile p in winter is originally derived from om mineralization 5 2 2 indirect effect of s biogeochemistry on p in addition to activating p via om mineralization sulfate reduction to sulfide can limit fe concentrations in anoxic sediments through the formation of insoluble iron sulfide precipitates fes fes2 and thereby indirectly regulate p availability rozan et al 2002 because iron sulfide minerals have a low point of zero charge and do not adsorb phosphate at neutral ph bebie et al 1998 these iron sulfide reactions effectively solubilize original fe detained p which dissolves into the porewater and removes fe from the solution sulfide accumulation has been proven to enhance p release in anoxic sediments pagès et al 2011 ding et al 2012 based on the above findings the large increase in labile s in surface layers which is indicative of rapid msr appears to be accompanied by a parallel increase in labile p fluxes due to the cir dissolution driven release of p previously bound to fe iii oxy hydroxide however the labile p and s distributions do not show any accordance in any of the depth profiles figs 4 and 5 the absence of the expected relationship between labile s and p distributions might be explained by the following factors 1 little p was initially bound to fe iii oxy hydroxide 2 cir does not favor p bound fe iii oxy hydroxide 3 fe iii oxy hydroxide is sufficient to retain the p released via cir dissolution however fe bound p content is not deficient at any depth fig 3 therefore we consider that abundant active fe in sediment plays a crucial role in regulating p behavior and p cycling and weakens the effect of s redox cycling accordingly in other words cir does not favor p bound fe iii oxy hydroxide to the best of our knowledge this phenomenon has not been observed in previous chinese or international studies 5 3 tide induced variation in s behavior msr can be fueled by locally enriched om even in oxic sediments leading to local s enrichment bottrell et al 2009 pages et al 2014 however in view of the particular conditions of the intertidal zone the surface layers with high s fluxes in this study should be considered differently firstly in the case of high surface s fluxes in both summer and winter no pattern of decreased fed fet ratios and increased ts concentrations appeared in the sediment as expected therefore the s released by msr is not effectively accumulated as solid sulfide but is instead continuously reoxidized by other oxidants such as oxygen or nitrate hence this case may not be related to seasonal changes secondly eh values measured in winter during the low tide period reached 205 0 in the surface layers and were accompanied by high s at jw1 even if msr produces s it should be quickly reoxidized instead of accumulating to high levels throughout the layer hypoxia is likely to develop in surface sediments during flood tide whereas hyperoxic conditions dominate the surface sediment during ebb tide teasdale et al 1998 therefore we surmised that the high s concentrations observed in the surface layers were generated by high rates of msr during the flood tide period and were reoxidized during the ebb tide period to verify this assumption further sampling work was performed and agi dgt probes were deployed at the mid tide line of the intertidal zone during the flood tide period ft and the ebb tide period et in winter and next summer respectively fig 9 shows that in surface layer rapid production of s occurred during the flood tide period while this newly accumulated s was rapidly consumed during the ebb tide period despite diverse vertical variations between the summer and winter surveys therefore this outcome provides tangible evidence for the first time that the tidal cycle plays an important role in msr and s cycling in this mangrove coast the effect of the tidal cycle on msr and s cycling can further explain the phenomenon of high s and low p fluxes in surface layers cir released p can be detained by sufficiently abundant fe iii oxy hydroxide in surface sediment as discussed in section 5 2 2 with the ongoing consumption of fe iii oxy hydroxide by s however p will be continuously released and is difficult to re adsorb thus labile p should gradually increase nevertheless the temporary accumulation of s during flood tide consumes only a limited amount of fe iii oxy hydroxide to form fes and release p which is easily re adsorbed by residual fe iii oxy hydroxide during ebb tide the fes can be oxidized to fe iii oxy hydroxide again thereby sustaining a high retention capacity for p obviously in addition to om mineralization this tide induced s cycling has a substantial influence on fe redox cycling and indirectly controls the behavior of p 5 4 net p flux via submarine groundwater discharge in coastal regions recirculated seawater has been recognized as an important pathway for the transport of dissolved substances into coastal waters the tide is a major driving force of seawater recirculation and the overlying seawater seeps into sediments during flood tide and returns to the seawater during ebb tide burnett et al 2003 this advection process can cause the exchange of p between sediment porewater and overlying seawater a previous study in the jiulong river estuary reported that based on the mass balance of radium isotopes the flux of recirculated seawater was approximately 0 26 0 54 107 m3 d 1 in winter wang et al 2015 which is equivalent to 3 66 7 59 10 2 m3 m 2 d 1 to estimate the net p flux we must know the end member p concentrations in seawater and porewater because p concentrations in the overlying seawater were measured only in winter in our study we estimated the net p flux only in winter the continuous monitoring of p concentrations in the overlying seawater shows a clear decline from low tide to high tide fig s3 the overlying seawater penetrates into the surface sediment during flood tide therefore the end member concentrations of seawater should be calculated as the average p concentration of the overlying seawater from low tide to high tide i e 0 149 mg l 1 in winter the average p concentration of the uppermost 1 cm of sediment at each station was chosen as the end member value for the porewater i e 0 024 0 001 mg l 1 0 025 0 001 mg l 1 and 0 289 0 005 mg l 1 for jw1 jw2 and jw3 respectively thus it is easy to determine the p fluxes by multiplying the recirculated seawater flux by the concentration difference between end members which yields net p fluxes of 0 148 0 001 to 0 306 0 001 mmol m 2 d 1 in the intertidal zone jw1 and jw2 and 0 165 0 006 to 0 343 0 013 mmol m 2 d 1 in the subtidal zone jw3 this calculated result suggests that the porewater could be a p source for the overlying seawater in anoxic submerged regions and a p sink for the overlying seawater in oxic intertidal regions 5 5 implications of fe s p coupling for p cycling in this estuarine intertidal zone the potential impact of fe s p coupling on p cycling may be considerable especially under the influence of tidal cycles and seasonal changes as shown in the diagram in fig 10 a p accumulates in anoxic porewater via om mineralization and the release of fe p via mir and msr then steadily diffuses upwards because of the concentration gradient additionally p from the overlying seawater is imported by recirculated seawater during flood tide periods both types of p can be adsorbed by abundant fe iii oxy hydroxide in oxic sediments and precipitate as fe p during ebb tide periods an increase in the oxic depth and the presence of sufficiently abundant fe iii oxy hydroxide in the near surface sediment favor this adsorption process moreover tide induced fes reoxidation recovers the adsorption ability of fe iii oxy hydroxide hence this process leads to consistently low p concentrations in the uppermost porewater and this porewater p cannot be transported to the overlying water these processes proceed until winter as shown in fig 10b leading to solid reactive fe p enrichment in the near surface sediment and labile p accumulation in anoxic deep porewater under certain conditions anoxic and mir dominated conditions can form in the topmost sediment layer in winter such as at station jw3 on one hand fe iii oxy hydroxide is constantly consumed by intense mir which weakens the p detaining ability of fe iii oxy hydroxide on the other hand the p released by abundant fe p in the surface layer easily migrates to porewater this released p in surface porewater together with the high concentrations of p in deeper layers can then be substantially exported to the overlying seawater via recirculated seawater advection and molecular diffusion this process appears to be the release mechanism for porewater p in underwater environments in the subtidal zone the special situation discussed above does not appear to form readily at the stations jw1 and jw2 in the intertidal zone in winter nevertheless in the subsequent riverine flood season depicted in fig 10c the intertidal zone can be covered by deep and turbid water resulting in sustained low oxygen conditions additionally abundant riverine runoff limits the supply of sulfate for porewater from the overlying seawater which weakens the msr process due to the depletion of sulfate and enhances the terrigenous reactive fe input in the above two cases the mir process in the surface layer is enhanced and releases a large quantity of p into the overlying water over a short period of time to further validate our conclusions additional sampling was performed before april and after july the riverine flood season using the same dgt method in the subsequent year the dgt labile p fluxes in the depth profiles shown in fig 11 show pronounced removal after the riverine flood season providing direct proof of labile p remobilization and migration to the overlying seawater generally the red tides occurring in the adjacent xiamen bay in spring and summer are considered to be a consequence of the large input of p from the jiulong river yang et al 2012 based on the above discussion this hypothesis might not be complete because a large quantity of p released from the sediment and porewater during the flood season has been ignored we believe that the surface sediment in the intertidal zone that accumulates p is a potential p source for coastal water especially during the flood season and that its contribution to the p budget and eutrophication in the jiulong river estuary and adjacent xiamen bay cannot be ignored 6 conclusions the in situ high resolution measurement of porewater solutes via dgt provided insight into the biogeochemical cycles and interactions occurring within the studied mangrove coast the labile s and fe distributions exhibit an intense competitive relationship between msr and mir demonstrating that in addition to the expected msr processes mir is also an important or even predominant biogeochemical process for om mineralization in this fe rich mangrove coast in summer significantly positive correlations were found between labile p and fe throughout the depth profiles verifying the mechanism of fe redox controlled p release adsorption in sediments in winter however the weaker correlations between labile p and fe in deep anoxic porewater suggest continuous p accumulation via fe detained p remobilization and op mineralization caused by mir and msr our observation of labile s enrichment during flood tide and consumption during ebb tide in surface porewater documented for the first time provides valuable insight and indicates the rapid switching between the production and consumption of s within a tidal cycle furthermore this observation confirms that the tidal cycle plays a vital role in msr and s cycling the net p fluxes caused by the recirculated seawater in winter indicate that the porewater tends to be a source of p for the overlying seawater in the anoxic submerged region and to be a sink of p for the overlying seawater in the oxic intertidal zone in winter the continuous accumulation of labile p in the surface sediment of the intertidal zone must be released at some point our findings indicate that the accumulated p in the intertidal zone is rapidly released during the flood season in the subsequent spring or summer when an oxygen deficit most likely occurs and the mir process is likely highly dominant within the top layer of the sediment therefore a large quantity of p released to the costal ocean over a very short time may affect the nutrient structure and the aquatic ecosystem acknowledgments this work was supported by the national natural science foundation of china grant no

6843,outcrop analogs for aquifers allow measurements of permeability with relatively high resolution and mapping sedimentary unit types the spatial bivariate structure of permeability is defined by aquifer architecture the architecture is often organized into a hierarchy of unit types and associated permeability modes across different spatial scales the composite covariance or semivariogram is a linear summation of the auto and cross covariances or semivariograms of unit types defined at smaller scales weighted by the related proportions and transition probabilities it is well known that an appreciable fraction of the composite variance arises from differences in mean permeability across unit types defined at smaller scales previous work has shown that the transition probabilities usually define the spatial bivariate correlation structure the composite spatial bivariate statistics for permeability covariance or semivariogram will not be representative unless data locations allow proper definition of the transition probabilities of the units quantification of the stratal architecture can be used to better interpret the transition probabilities and thereby improve a model for the sample covariance and semivariogram in this paper we use an inverse modeling algorithm to fit the components of the hierarchical model written as nested functions in developing a hierarchical spatial correlation models specifically the least squares criterion along with prior information and other weighted constraints are used as the objective function for the inverse problem which is solved by the gauss newton levenberg marquardt method the estimated covariance and transition probability models provides accurate representation of the spatial correlation structure of permeability

bivariate correlation models covariance or semivariogram developed from measurements of permeability k are important in developing flow and transport models sudicky 1986 dagan 1989 rubin 1995 2003 dai et al 2004a de barros et al 2015 bianchi et al 2011 zarlenga et al 2016 soltanian and ritzi 2014 soltanian et al 2015a b 2017 2018 de barros 2018 di dato et al 2018 western et al 2001 suggested that spatial bivariate correlation models do not adequately represent connectivity of higher permeability pathways however lee et al 2007 showed that they can by demonstrating that both transition probability based modeling and semivariogram based modeling both spatial bivariate methods could be used to create models for connected permeable facies controlling flow within a three dimensional 3d alluvial fan aquifer system speaking in most general terms spatial bivariate methods based on using indicator space variables to represent discrete units will be the most useful approach for representing entire aquifer aquitard systems multi point models have been proposed in this context e g ronayne et al 2008 tahmasebi et al 2012 tahmasebi 2018 but are outside the scope of this article the focus of this article is on understanding and modeling the multiscale and hierarchical heterogeneity within an aquifer unit see section 3 for definition of multiscale and hierarchical heterogeneity in this context the semivariogram or spatial covariance is useful for representing heterogeneity and understanding how it fundamentally affects the processes of flow and reactive transport e g soltanian et al 2015a b dai et al 2018 spatial covariance models that combine indicator and continuous space variables give the most insight in this context e g review by ritzi and soltanian 2015 traditionally ln k covariance was represented by a single finite integral scale representing its spatial correlation structure leblanc et al 1991 dagan 1989 recently attention has been focused on representing ln k across different spatial scales so that the integral scale may be neither finite nor single valued ritzi et al 2004 dai et al 2004a b ramanathan et al 2008 2010 soltanian and ritzi 2014 ritzi and soltanian 2015 providing a strong link between the spatial correlation structure of ln k and the underlying sedimentary architecture is essential soltanian and ritzi 2014 this is in fact a goal of this article in this article we are referring to discrete structural hierarchies sensu cushman 1990 in which larger scale facies types e g bounded by larger scale stratification comprise assemblages of smaller scale mutually exclusive facies types e g medium scale stratification which in turn comprise still smaller scale facies and so on note that works such as di federico and neumann 1998 involve a different more abstract conceptual hierarchy in which facies are not mutually exclusive and have infinite length as clarified in cushman s 1990 discussion our focus is only on discrete structural hierarchies recently the spatial bivariate correlation structure of ln k was developed for bimodal media rubin 1995 multimodal media lu and zhang 2002 barrash and clemo 2002 and hierarchical multimodal media ritzi et al 2004 dai et al 2004a b ramanathan et al 2008 2010 importantly rubin 1995 derived expressions for the mean variance and spatial covariance of ln k for bimodal media in this approach the ln k is modeled with a continuous space function and the presence of units is modeled with an indicator space function in rubin 1995 the correlation structure of indicator random variables was assigned somewhat arbitrarily without specifying how the mean variance shape and range of the indicator correlation function are related to the volume proportion geometry and spatial organization of sedimentary unit types see also rubin and journel 1991 lu and zhang 2002 expanded rubin s 1995 expressions in order to include any number of modes see also barrash and clemo 2002 they used carle and fogg 1996 1997 approach in which the structure of the indicator random variables is directly defined by quantifiable physical attributes of unit types including volume proportions and mean lengths for the bimodal media they investigated the sensitivity of the composite variance of ln k to the volume proportions of units the difference in mean permeability across units and the variance in permeability within each unit as reviewed by ritzi and soltanian 2015 coordinated hydrogeologic and sedimentologic field studies have created new highly resolved data sets at a number of field sites located in different depositional settings this included highly resolved data characterizing the sedimentary architecture and related spatial variation in permeability within fluvial e g ritzi et al 2004 gershenzon et al 2015a b c alluvial e g dai et al 2005 and lake shoreline deposits e g kalinovich et al 2012 ritzi et al 2013 soltanian and ritzi 2014 these studies have created a body of literature studying the link between sedimentary architecture and heterogeneity in attributes such as k and sorption distribution coefficient kd anderson 1989 1991a b davis et al 1993 1997 allen king et al 1998 barrash and clemo 2002 biteman et al 2004 dai et al 2005 kalinovich et al 2012 ritzi et al 2013 soltanian and ritzi 2014 soltanian et al 2015a b the most important finding in this body of work is that the spatial bivariate correlation structure is essentially the cross transition probability structure defined by the sedimentary architecture because of that it has been possible to identify and model the separate influence of each scale of sedimentary architecture on the spatial correlation structure in these studies it has also been shown in these studies that geologic data more easily acquired than permeability and sorption distribution coefficient data can be used to better infer and model the spatial correlation structure at each scale and thereby improve the overall model see soltanian et al 2015a b c as reviewed by ritzi and soltanian 2015 a spatial bivariate statistic e g semivariogram can be very well approximated by γ ξ ζ h r j o i o 1 2 σ ξ ro ζ ro σ ξ ji ζ ji m ξ ro m ξ ji m ζ ro m ζ ji p ro h t ro j i h where the m ξ ro are the univariate sample means and σ ξ ro ζ ro are the univariate point sample variances ξ ζ or point covariances ξ ζ computed from subpopulations of the data per level i i e smaller scale unit type in other words the composite auto and cross sample semivariograms were very well approximated using only the spatial bivariate structure of the p ro h t ro j i h for cross transition probabilities see section 2 1 for definition of the transition probability thus the semivariograms grows with lag as grows the sample probability of transitioning across different smaller scale facies types and stabilizes with lag as does those sample cross transition probabilities in this article we introduce an inverse modeling approach that allows fitting sample statistics for the transition probabilities and covariances in smaller scale units and using geologic data to improve the estimation of transition probability structures for the largest lag distances in this work we focus on unconsolidated sediments of española basin new mexico specifically we focus on fitting models for the transition probabilities semivariograms and covariances at a lower hierarchical level to be used in developing a model for a higher level expressed as a function of those lower level models we follow an inverse methodology presented by dai et al 2004b in which lower level models for semivariograms covariances and transition probabilities are fitted with nested functions dai et al 2004b showed that the final global semivariogram and covariance models obtained from the estimated parameters compare well to the sample semivariogram and covariance here we use their approach to see how we can improve estimation of semivariogram covariance and transition probability models for outcrop data from española basin to estimate the spatial covariance structure of intrinsic or non intrinsic random functions from point or spatially averaged data samper and neuman 1989 described a cross validation method woodbury and sudicky 1991 modeled the experimental semivariogram data from the borden aquifer with an exponential function by the constrained simplex approach and the levenberg marquardt method separately kitanidis 1997 reviewed the methods for fitting functions to sample covariance models and the estimation criteria that might be used if the application of model functions is known the fitting process could have an estimation criterion based on that application for example if models are to be used for kriging and point estimation cross validation can be used with an estimation criterion based on differences between kriging estimates and observations if the models are to be used in analytically derived models for transport parameters e g macrodispersion and plume retardation an estimation criterion could be based on differences between computed and observed spatial moments of mass in the solute plume and on differences between the model functions and the sample covariances and transition probabilities following dai et al 2004b here we use a least squares estimation criterion and impose constraints so that the transition probability models obey probability laws the inverse problems are solved by the gauss newton levenberg marquardt method dai and samper 2004 this paper is organized as follows section 2 presents the univariate and spatial bivariate statistics analytical solution for transition probability as well as the composite covariance function and its integral scale section 3 outlines the field measured data for ln k and sedimentary architecture at española basin new mexico section 4 presents results and discussions finally section 5 highlights the main conclusions of this work 2 multiscale and hierarchical correlation models 2 1 univariate and spatial bivariate statistics ritzi et al 2004 developed a general form of a hierarchical multimodal spatial bivariate correlation structure while the model can be written with any number of hierarchical levels here we write it in the form of a macroform composite scale level ii made up of n mesoforms smaller scale level i filling space in mutually exclusive occurrences within depositional environments see section 3 for definition of macroforms and mesoforms the indicator random variable i k x is written as 1 i k x 1 if unit k occurs at location x 0 otherwise then the composite log permeability y x can be expressed as 2 y x k 1 n i k x y k x where y k x represents ln k within units if the volume proportion or indicator of facies k is defined as p k k 1 2 n then k 1 n p k 1 and the expected value of i k is equal to p k the composite mean m y and variance σ y 2 of y x are see ritzi et al 2004 soltanian et al 2015c d 3 m y k 1 n p k m k 4 σ y 2 k 1 n p k σ k 2 1 2 k 1 n i k n p k p i m k m i 2 where m k and σ k 2 are facies mean and variance of y k x respectively as applied to measuring spatial continuity of facies distributions the transition probability uses indicator variables to quantify the conditional probability t ki h ϕ of transitioning in direction ϕ from sedimentary unit type i to type k 5 t ki h ϕ pr i i x h ϕ 1 and i k x 1 pr i k x 1 carle and fogg 1996 ritzi 2000 as per ritzi et al 2004 the composite spatial correlation of y x can be expressed by volume proportions transition probabilities and in or cross facies correlation of y k x 6 γ y h ϕ k 1 n i 1 n γ ki h ϕ p k t ki h ϕ where γ y h ϕ is the composite semivariogram in ϕ direction and γ ki h ϕ is the in facies semivariogram in ϕ direction if k i and cross facies if k i similarly the composite centered covariance c y h ϕ can be written as 7 c y h ϕ k 1 n i 1 n c ki h ϕ m k m i p k t ki h ϕ m y 2 where c ki h ϕ is the covariance in ϕ direction within or across unit types eq 7 is an exact identity in relating the composite covariance to the univariate and bivariate statistics for units defined at lower hierarchical levels with n 2 eqs 4 and 7 become the same as those by rubin 1995 and lu and zhang 2002 for the bimodal media ritzi et al 2004 illustrated the exact equivalence of the right and left hand sides using sample statistics computed from exhaustively sampled data representing cross bedded sediments in a point bar deposit also see ritzi et al 2013 in which the same analysis was performed for data from borden research site dai et al 2004a similarly showed the equivalence of the right and left hand sides using data used in this study from sediments of española basin here we assume that the cross covariances have negligible contributions i e c ki h ϕ 0 k i this is a common assumption e g rubin 1995 which is supported by dai et al 2004a b and ritzi et al 2004 in section 4 1 1 we will show that this is a justified assumption therefore we can write eq 7 in the following form see dai et al 2004a b 8 c y h ϕ k 1 n p k c kk h ϕ t kk h ϕ 1 2 k 1 n i k n m k m i 2 p k p i t ki h ϕ eqs 3 4 6 and 8 are general formulations for composite mean variance semivariogram and covariance of multimodal y x the transition probabilities in 6 and 8 can be approached with markov chain model presented below 2 2 analytical solution for transition probabilities three dimensional 3d markov chain model can be represented by a one dimensional 1d markov chain model carle and fogg 1997 lu and zhang 2002 thus the continuous lag transition probability matrix t in ϕ direction is written as 9 t h ϕ t 11 h ϕ t 12 h ϕ t 1 n h ϕ t 21 h ϕ t 22 h ϕ t 2 n h ϕ t n 1 h ϕ t n 2 h ϕ t nn h ϕ e r h ϕ where r is a n n transition rate matrix whose entry rkj denote conditional rates of change per unit length from unit types k to i in ϕ direction 10 r r 11 r 12 r 1 n r 21 r 22 r 2 n r n 1 r n 2 r nn if r is known the transition probability matrix t can be evaluated by eigenvalue analyses let η j j 1 n be eigenvalues of the transition rate matrix r and z j j 1 n be their corresponding spectral component matrices which are computed by 11 z j m j η m i r m j η m η j where i is the identity matrix using spectral matrices the transition probability matrix is written as 12 t h ϕ j 1 n e η j h ϕ z j in order to obtain an analytical formulation for the transition probabilities we apply two assumptions below i the transition probability depends on volume proportions and therefore the off diagonal transition probabilities are computed using carle and fogg 1996 13 t ki h ϕ 1 t kk h ϕ p i 1 p k for i k differentiating eq 13 with respect to h ϕ at h ϕ 0 and assuming the embedding coefficients of unity following carle and fogg 1996 and ritzi 2000 the off diagonal transition rates are written as 14 r ki r kk p i 1 p k p i l k ϕ 1 p k for i k where l k ϕ is the mean length of the category k along lines in the direction ϕ ii the juxtapositional tendencies between categories k and i are symmetric in the direction ϕ see carle and fogg 1997 and thus we have 15 t ki h ϕ p i p k t ik h ϕ for i k 16 r ki p i p k r ik for i k therefore r ki r kk p i 1 p k p i l k ϕ 1 p k for i k by using 14 and 16 we can rewrite the transition rate matrix as 17 r 1 l 1 ϕ p 2 l 1 ϕ 1 p 1 p n l 1 ϕ 1 p 1 p 1 l 1 ϕ 1 p 1 p 2 1 l 1 ϕ 1 p 1 p n l 1 ϕ 1 p 1 p 1 l 1 ϕ 1 p 1 p 2 l 1 ϕ 1 p 1 p n 1 l 1 ϕ 1 p 1 1 λ i p 1 1 p 2 p n p 1 p 2 1 p n p 1 p 2 p n 1 where λ i l 1 ϕ 1 p 1 which is in fact the indicator correlation scale to compute eigenvalues of r we have det r η i 0 or 18 p 1 1 λ i η p 2 p n p 1 p 2 1 λ i η p n p 1 p 2 p n 1 λ i η 0 by applying properties of determinants for row and column operations and i 1 n p i 1 eq 18 is written as 19 1 λ i η 0 0 0 1 λ i η 0 p 1 p 2 λ i η 0 therefore one can write 20 η 1 λ i η n 1 0 and the matrix r has eigenvalues η 1 0 η 2 1 λ i and n 2 repeated eigenvalues of 1 λ i then we can compute spectral component matrices with 11 21 z 1 p 1 p 2 p n p 1 p 2 p n p 1 p 2 p n z 2 1 p 1 p 2 p n p 1 1 p 2 p n p 1 p 2 1 p n substituting eq 12 with the computed eigenvalues and spectral component matrices we obtain an analytical solution for the transition probabilities as 22 t ki h ϕ p i δ ki p i e h ϕ λ i for k i 1 n where δ ki is the kronecker delta 2 3 composite covariance function and integral scale the general shape of covariance function could be determined by the variance in length of unit types as per ritzi 2000 in nature unit length distributions are typically erlangian guin and ritzi 2008 soltanian et al 2015a b with a coefficient of variation of the order of unity which gives rise to exponential like transition probability structures white and willis 2000 ritzi 2000 ritzi and allen king 2007 field studies conducted in different deposits with highly resolved data have shown that the correlation structures could be parsimoniously represented by exponential structures one for each level of the hierarchy ritzi et al 2004 dai et al 2005 ritzi et al 2013 soltanian and ritzi 2014 ritzi and soltanian 2015 therefore here we consider an exponential function for the auto covariance c kk h ϕ as 23 c kk h ϕ σ k 2 e h ϕ λ k for k 1 n where λ k is the integral scale substituting 8 with 22 into 23 we obtain the composite covariance function in ϕ direction as 24 c y h ϕ k 1 n p k 2 σ k 2 e h ϕ λ k k 1 n p k 1 p k σ k 2 e h ϕ λ k λ i λ k λ i 1 2 k 1 n i k n m k m i 2 p k p i e h ϕ λ i the composite integral scale λ y is then defined using the formula below see dagan 1989 and soltanian and ritzi 2014 soltanian et al 2015e5 25 λ y 1 σ y 2 0 c y h d h incorporating 24 into 25 results in 26 λ y k 1 n p k 2 σ k 2 λ k k 1 n p k 1 p k σ k 2 λ k λ i λ k λ i 1 2 k 1 n i k n m k m i 2 p k p i λ i k 1 n p k σ k 2 1 2 k 1 n i k n m k m i 2 p k p i from 26 one can see that λ y depends on volume proportions variances and integral scales of y k x and the indicator correlation scale λ i more information about this equation and the relationship between different parameters are found in dai et al 2004b following dai et al 2004b here we fit the model functions to the sample covariance and transition probability in horizontal y and vertical z directions an inverse modeling method developed by dai et al 2004b is applied here to estimate the variances and integral scales for covariance of each unit volume proportions and indicator correlation scales of transition probability functions finally using estimated parameters we obtain the composite covariances in horizontal and vertical directions that can represent the spatial correlation structure of the measured permeability accurately representing the correlation structure has important practical implications in developing spatial bivariate correlation models for use in estimation simulation or analytical derivation of macrodispersivity and retardation factor models see soltanian et al 2015a b 3 sedimentary architecture outcrop analogue studies have been used in both reservoir and aquifer characterization e g goggin et al 1992 davis et al 1993 ritzi et al 2000 dai et al 2005 ritzi et al 2013 in these studies sedimentary units were mapped and digitized with indicator variables and permeability was measured with for example an air permeameter we chose an outcrop in the española basin new mexico which was mapped and previously studied by smith 2000 kuhle and smith 2001 and gaud et al 2004 see fig 2 in dai et al 2005 showing map and photos of the outcrop the outcrop is 370 m long approximately along structural strike and exposes 30 m of stratigraphic thickness the surveyed lithofacies at level i permeability measurements are shown in fig 1 the sediments represent both channel and inter channel deposits middle miocene tesuque formation are both ribbon form and tabular and vary in grain size from clay to sandy gravel gaud et al 2004 dai et al 2005 studied unconsolidated sediments of the española basin to address the following practical issues 1 they showed there is not a unique hierarchy to classify sediments and that different classifications could be obtained based on textural attributes here we follow their classification which is described below 2 they discussed how maps of exposed sedimentary units could be used to generate data indicating lithology which could be used to develop transition probability models for sedimentary units also they showed how these models significantly improve equivocal sample semivarigrams see also ritzi et al 2013 3 finally they addressed issues related to partially exposed sedimentary units in outcrops and they presented a bayesian based method for reducing this bias in estimating volume proportions and mean and variance in length of sedimentary units see also white and willis 2000 ramanathan et al 2008 2010 we describe the outcrop deposits using a hierarchical framework following dai et al 2005 see also scheibe and freyberg 1995 such a framework related to hydrogeologically relevant scales dai et al 2005 considered three levels of hierarchical level for simplicity here we only consider two tiered hierarchy defined mainly based on the gain size sedimentary textures and structures in smaller scale level i we consider four unit types illustrated in fig 1 and table 1 note that this hierarchy represents one organizational framework and others are possible see dai et al 2005 although the log permeability distribution is weakly multimodal there are statistically significant differences in the univariate statistics on log permeability among the populations taken within each sedimentary unit see fig 4 in dai et al 2005 showing the cumulative frequency of ln k data at each hierarchical level the modes of ln k change at each hierarchical level in the organization of the sediment gaud et al 2004 below we briefly describe the relevant hierarchical levels considered in this work with smaller scale level i presented in table 1 for more information you may read dai et al 2004a ritzi et al 2004 soltanian and ritzi 2014 2018 soltanian and ritzi 2014 level i mesoforms table 1 shows four mesoforms units this units are formed by microforms the detail description of microforms could be found in dai et al 2005 mesoforms are bounded by surfaces across which there are distinct changes in microform types or their proportion orientation and average grain size the statistics of permeability data for mesoforms are in table 1 the proportion and mean length of mesoforms scale calculated from the indicator data shown in fig 1a are listed in table 2 level ii macroforms mesoforms are organized into macroforms which are the largest feature representing the cumulative effect of multiple depositional events over a long period of time here we have a macroform scale composed of channel and inter channel deposits 4 results and discussions in presented results below we will fit the model functions to the covariances and transition probabilities in the horizontal and vertical directions an inverse methodology developed by dai et al 2004b is applied to estimate the facies variances and integral scales as well as volume proportions and indicator correlation scales finally we will input all of the estimated parameters to obtain the composite covariances in horizontal and vertical directions we will analyze the contributions from the auto and cross terms as well the results are compared with the covariance model developed with a single finite integral scale 4 1 spatial correlation in horizontal direction 4 1 1 covariances we used the ln k data and computed facies sample covariances in the horizontal y direction then an exponential function was fitted to individual sample covariances to do the fitting we used an inverse method by dai et al 2004b by fitting components transition probability and local covariance of the hierarchical model with a nested function we used a least squares criterion along with parameter defining prior information and other weighted constraints as the objective function of the inverse model the model was solved by the gauss newton levenberg marquardt method the estimated parameters in this approach include parameters defining correlation functions such as structural ranges variance or proportion and also weights although the parameter estimation tool is robust and can work automatically not everything in inverse approach is automatic nor should it be carrera and neuman 1986 dai et al 2004b 2014 trial and error is still carried out in the estimation procedure by manually modifying the parameter bounds initial parameter values and the initial weighting coefficients to the prior information personal judgment helped us to choose a group of optimal parameters based on model parsimony values of objective functions and the coefficients of variation for parameters the estimated parameters for level i mesoform facies covariance models are listed in table 3 and the fitting results are plotted in fig 2 the estimated volume proportions in table 3 are close to what we calculated from indicator data using whole outcrop data in table 2 as shown in fig 2 the auto covariances start from the facies variances at zero lag distances and decrease to zero along the exponential curve as lag distance increases thus the estimated variances σ k 2 are the same as or close to the unit variances listed in table 2 the cross covariances start from zero at the lag distance zero and fluctuate around zero line with a decreasing trend they can only fit to a straight line with zero values this in fact justifies the assumption of ignoring the cross covariances and is consistent with results of prior studies see ritzi et al 2004 dai et al 2004a b we found that the estimated integral scales are positively correlated to volume proportions and the mean lengths through λ k 0 089 2 934 p k and λ k 0 907 0 236 l k respectively with a correlation coefficients higher than 0 96 the implication is that the larger the mean length the larger the proportion and the integral scale the high correlation coefficients between integral scale and mean length or volume proportion indicate that integral scale is a scale dependent parameter and it mainly defined by the proportion and mean length or thickness of sedimentary units note that unit types f fines in table 1 mainly distributes on the top of the outcrop and there are only 30 permeability measurements were collected there this is related to practical problems in measuring low permeability with air permeameter 4 1 2 transition probabilities transition probability functions can be obtained in three ways from i indicator data corresponding to locations of permeability measurements ii indicator data obtained on the whole outcrop and iii geological interpretation see carle and fogg 1996 ritzi 2000 the indicator data corresponding to the permeability measurements were used to compute the sample transition probabilities in horizontal direction using t progs carle 1999 then the transition probabilities were fitted with exponential functions we estimated the indicator correlation scale λ i and four mesoforms volume proportions with the inverse model by dai et al 2004b the estimated volume proportions are listed in table 3 the resulting λ i is 6 95 m the fitting results are plotted in fig 3 we also used the indicator data measured on the whole outcrop to compute the sample transition probabilities in horizontal direction the transition probabilities were again fitted with exponential functions the estimated volume proportions are those listed in table 3 the indicator correlation scale is 12 2 m λ i which is larger than when indicator data from permeability locations are used using indicator data of the whole outcrop provide a better estimation for transition probabilities however as it is clear in fitting results plotted in fig 5 fig 4 the sample transition probabilities still show some noise by using geological interpretation or geological conjecture combining the sedimentologists systematic analysis we computed the mean lengths of the four units using the embedding coefficients following approach by carle and fogg 1996 and ritzi 2000 then we calculated the indicator correlation scale the results are listed in table 4 we assumed exponential functions for the transition probabilities and derived a uniform indicator correlation scale here we use a mean indicator correlation scale to evaluate the model indicator scale as λ i 1 n k 1 n λ ik 12 79 m which is close to what we obtained using indicator data on the whole outcrop with volume proportions and model indicator scales defined by geological interpretation we obtain auto and cross transition probabilities 4 1 3 composite covariance using the estimated parameters of local covariance and transition probability models we computed the composite integral scale in horizontal direction with eq 26 as λ y of 3 81 m we modeled the composite covariance with a single exponential function as 31 c y h σ y 2 e h λ y from the composite covariance in eq 24 we can see that sum of the first two terms derived from the first term in eq 8 represents auto covariances of y k x weighted by the volume proportion and auto transition probabilities therefore this sum is called the auto term the third term in 24 corresponds to the second term in 8 which represents the expected difference in y k x or the contrast in the mean across the unit boundaries weighted by the cross transition probabilities therefore it is called the cross term the relative contributions of these terms to the composite covariance are computed by using the estimated parameters the results are shown in figs 5 and 6 in fig 5 one can see that when lag distance λ y 3 81 m the auto term decays to zero and only the cross term contributes to the composite covariance when the lag distance λ y both terms contribute to the covariance structure the covariance model with hierarchical structure model cy better represents the sample covariance structure and the correlation scale than the unimodal model with a single finite integral scale we also computed the covariance model using proportions and indicator correlation scale estimated from the indicator data measured on the whole outcrop fig 6 summarizes the results in which the auto term decays to zero and only the cross term contributes to the composite covariance the covariance model with hierarchical structure model cy again fits to the sample covariance better than the unimodal model finally we compare three methods for estimating the sample covariance in the first model model a hereafter the transition probabilities were estimated based on the indicator data corresponding to the location of permeability measurements in the second model model b hereafter the transition probabilities were estimated with the indicator data from whole outcrop model b has a better defined transition probability structure than model a compare figs 3 and 4 showing better definitions for sample transition probabilities when indicator data of whole outcrop is used in the third model model c hereafter the transition probabilities were estimated from the geologic interpretations estimated parameters in table 4 the results are presented in fig 7 in model a the indicator correlation scale was underestimated comparing model a b and c we see that model b and c are nearly equal in all lag distances however at small lag distance model a fits the sample covariance better than both b and c however at larger lag distance model b and c with larger indicator correlation scales can better represent the composite sample covariance therefore permeability covariance structure is not well represented unless data locations allow proper definition of the transition probabilities of the units there is value in estimating transition probability model parameters using data on sedimentary architecture e g model b since geologic data are more abundant than permeability measurements also there are practical issues in measuring permeability on outcrop exposures such as accessibility and taking low permeability measurements another important point to consider is with regard to the applicability of models a b and c in predicting transport parameters such as macrodispersivity for example having the same variance the macrodispersivity derived from lagrangian based models for solute spreading is directly proportional to the composite integral scale λ y and the particle displacement variance is directly proportional to λ y 2 see sudicky 1986 dagan 1989 soltanian et al 2015c d therefore using covariance model a results in under estimation for both macrodispersivity and displacement variance additionally lagrangian based transport models that are derived using the hierarchical covariance structure defined by sedimentary architecture allow analyzing the contributions from auto and cross terms and therefore provide fundamental insight on how transport processes e g macrodispersion are defined by the correlation structure imparted by volume proportions and sizes of unit types see ramanathan et al 2008 2010 soltanian and ritzi 2014 soltanian et al 2015a b furthermore by quantitatively decomposing the macrodispersion into unit types related contributions we gain better understanding on how the time dependent rate of spreading is defined by the cross transition probability correlation structure imparted by the proportions and sizes of the larger scale unit types see ritzi and soltanian 2015 4 2 spatial correlation in vertical direction 4 2 1 covariances we used ln k data to compute local sample covariances in the vertical z direction following steps explained in previous section 4 1 1 we calculated local sample covariances here we also ignored the cross covariances and fitted the auto covariances with exponential functions the variances sills are equal to those in the horizontal direction thus we only estimated the local integral scales shown in table 5 the fitting results are plotted in fig 8 the general shape and the ranges of these auto covariances are explained by the estimated model similar to the results for the horizontal direction the estimated vertical integral scales are positively correlated to the facies proportions and the mean thicknesses with λ zk 0 055 0 345 p k and correlation coefficient of 0 9 the λ zk 0 026 0 131 l zk provide the relation between the estimated vertical integral relationship and the mean thicknesses with a correlation coefficient of 0 75 the high correlation coefficients between integral scale and mean length or proportion indicate that integral scale is a scale dependent parameter and it mainly defined by the mean length of sedimentary units since both horizontal and vertical integral scales are positively related to the proportions and the mean thicknesses they are positively related with one another in fact we found a fitting relation of λ zk 0 038 0 123 λ k between the estimated horizontal and vertical integral scales with a correlation coefficient of 0 97 4 2 2 transition probabilities we used the indicator data corresponding to the location of measured permeability to compute the sample transition probabilities in z direction then the transition probabilities were fitted in order to estimate the vertical indicator correlation scale and four volume proportions are fixed as those in horizontal direction the indicator correlation scale is 0 61 m and the fitting results are plotted in fig 9 the model with estimated parameters well captures the general shape and ranges of sample transition probabilities the indicator data from whole outcrop were also used to compute the sample transition probabilities in the vertical direction we only estimated the vertical indicator correlation scale and four volume proportions were fixed as those in horizontal direction the estimated indicator correlation scale is 0 72 m it is clear that indicator correlation scales are close weather using indicator data from whole outcrop or using indicator data corresponding to the locations of measured permeabilities therefore the fitting results were quite similar to those in fig 9 and we do not present them here by using geological interpretation or geological conjecture we first computed the mean thicknesses of the four units see table 3 and the embedding coefficients introduced by carle and fogg 1996 and ritzi 2000 to calculate the indicator correlation scales the results are listed in table 6 similar to section 4 1 2 we use the mean indicator correlation scales to compute the model indicator scale as λ zi 1 n k 1 n λ zik 1 15 m 4 2 3 composite covariance with the estimated parameters of local covariance and transition probability models the composite vertical covariance model in z direction is formed with eq 24 we also computed the composite integral scale in vertical direction as λ y 0 396 m using this value we modeled the composite covariance with an exponential function and a single finite integral scale unimodal model the relative contributions of the auto and cross terms to the composite hierarchical covariance are computed by using the estimated parameters all these results are plotted in fig 10 in fig 10 we can see that when the lag distance λ y 0 396 m the auto term decays to zero and only the cross term contributes to the composite covariance when lag distance λ y both terms contribute to the composite covariance the covariance model with hierarchical structure model cy is almost equal to the unimodal covariance model defined by a single integral scale it indicates that the composite covariance in the vertical direction could be modeled with unimodal function see samper and neuman 1989 woodbury and sudicky 1991 rubin et al 1999 however the hierarchical covariance model includes more physically based information about sedimentary architecture including volume proportions mean lengths of units the hierarchical model also provides a greater insight into how attributes of unit type assemblage influence the global spatial correlation which is clear here by the contributions of auto and cross terms e g rubin 1995 barrash and clemo 2002 ritzi et al 2004 therefore the hierarchical model can improve our ability to extrapolate the model into regions for which we have no permeability data but do have some knowledge of these attributes of the sediment this is not possible when fitting sample covariance with a unimodal function similar to previous section we also compare models a b and c in fig 11 we can see that model a and b are close note that in model a the transition probabilities were estimated based on the indicator data corresponding to the permeability measurements and the indicator correlation scale was slightly underestimated in model b the transition probabilities were estimated with the indicator data from whole outcrop the indicator scale in model c obtained from geological interpretation is over estimated 2 times higher than model a and b the estimated indicator correlation scales in models a and b can represent the covariance structure in a larger range of lag distances than model c thus the composite covariance in models a and b is the most representative of the special correlation of the log permeability in the vertical direction 5 conclusions we developed spatial correlation models for unconsolidated sediments of española basin new mexico in both horizontal and vertical directions by combining estimated volume proportions transition probabilities among categories and covariances of ln k data within sedimentary unit types organized into two hierarchical levels with four mesoforms at smaller scale level i and a macroform at larger scale level ii exponential functions were used to fit the transition probabilities and local covariances within mesoform units the fitting of the components of the hierarchical model written as nested exponential function was considered in developing a hierarchical covariance model the least squares criterion along with parameter prior information and other weighted constraints was used as the objective function of the inverse problem which was solved by the gauss newton levenberg marquardt method based on methods by dai et al 2004b importantly we found that permeability covariance structure is not well represented unless data locations allow proper definition of the transition probabilities of the units there is value in estimating transition probability model parameters using data on sedimentary architecture because geologic data are more abundant than permeability measurements also there are practical issues in measuring permeability on outcrop exposures such as accessibility and taking low permeability measurements we also found that the transition probability definition is underestimated if incomplete lithological data are used the definition is more representative with more data on sedimentary architecture the cross transitions from one unit types to another control the shape and provide better representation of the bivariate statistics specially in larger lag distances unimodal covariance model with a finite integral scale can provide reasonable representation for the bivariate statistics in the vertical direction the hierarchical models provide better estimates for the horizontal variability they show similar results to unimodal model in the vertical direction however the covariance models with hierarchical structure provide more fundamental information about the spatial variability for example the hierarchical models include more information about physical attributes of sediments including volume proportions mean lengths of units they also provide insights into how different attributes of unit type assemblage influence the composite correlation structure i e contributions of auto and cross terms therefore the hierarchical model can improve our ability to extrapolate the model into regions for which we have no permeability data but do have knowledge of physical attributes of the sediment this is in contrary to what we obtain by fitting sample covariance with a unimodal function we also found that because both vertical and horizontal integral scales are positively related to the facies proportions and the mean thicknesses they are also positively related to each other acknowledgements this work is partially funded by jilin university through a start up project awarded to the first

6843,outcrop analogs for aquifers allow measurements of permeability with relatively high resolution and mapping sedimentary unit types the spatial bivariate structure of permeability is defined by aquifer architecture the architecture is often organized into a hierarchy of unit types and associated permeability modes across different spatial scales the composite covariance or semivariogram is a linear summation of the auto and cross covariances or semivariograms of unit types defined at smaller scales weighted by the related proportions and transition probabilities it is well known that an appreciable fraction of the composite variance arises from differences in mean permeability across unit types defined at smaller scales previous work has shown that the transition probabilities usually define the spatial bivariate correlation structure the composite spatial bivariate statistics for permeability covariance or semivariogram will not be representative unless data locations allow proper definition of the transition probabilities of the units quantification of the stratal architecture can be used to better interpret the transition probabilities and thereby improve a model for the sample covariance and semivariogram in this paper we use an inverse modeling algorithm to fit the components of the hierarchical model written as nested functions in developing a hierarchical spatial correlation models specifically the least squares criterion along with prior information and other weighted constraints are used as the objective function for the inverse problem which is solved by the gauss newton levenberg marquardt method the estimated covariance and transition probability models provides accurate representation of the spatial correlation structure of permeability for field measured data from in española basin new mexico keywords aquifer architecture parameter estimation transition probability markov chain hierarchical organization 1 introduction spatial bivariate correlation models covariance or semivariogram developed from measurements of permeability k are important in developing flow and transport models sudicky 1986 dagan 1989 rubin 1995 2003 dai et al 2004a de barros et al 2015 bianchi et al 2011 zarlenga et al 2016 soltanian and ritzi 2014 soltanian et al 2015a b 2017 2018 de barros 2018 di dato et al 2018 western et al 2001 suggested that spatial bivariate correlation models do not adequately represent connectivity of higher permeability pathways however lee et al 2007 showed that they can by demonstrating that both transition probability based modeling and semivariogram based modeling both spatial bivariate methods could be used to create models for connected permeable facies controlling flow within a three dimensional 3d alluvial fan aquifer system speaking in most general terms spatial bivariate methods based on using indicator space variables to represent discrete units will be the most useful approach for representing entire aquifer aquitard systems multi point models have been proposed in this context e g ronayne et al 2008 tahmasebi et al 2012 tahmasebi 2018 but are outside the scope of this article the focus of this article is on understanding and modeling the multiscale and hierarchical heterogeneity within an aquifer unit see section 3 for definition of multiscale and hierarchical heterogeneity in this context the semivariogram or spatial covariance is useful for representing heterogeneity and understanding how it fundamentally affects the processes of flow and reactive transport e g soltanian et al 2015a b dai et al 2018 spatial covariance models that combine indicator and continuous space variables give the most insight in this context e g review by ritzi and soltanian 2015 traditionally ln k covariance was represented by a single finite integral scale representing its spatial correlation structure leblanc et al 1991 dagan 1989 recently attention has been focused on representing ln k across different spatial scales so that the integral scale may be neither finite nor single valued ritzi et al 2004 dai et al 2004a b ramanathan et al 2008 2010 soltanian and ritzi 2014 ritzi and soltanian 2015 providing a strong link between the spatial correlation structure of ln k and the underlying sedimentary architecture is essential soltanian and ritzi 2014 this is in fact a goal of this article in this article we are referring to discrete structural hierarchies sensu cushman 1990 in which larger scale facies types e g bounded by larger scale stratification comprise assemblages of smaller scale mutually exclusive facies types e g medium scale stratification which in turn comprise still smaller scale facies and so on note that works such as di federico and neumann 1998 involve a different more abstract conceptual hierarchy in which facies are not mutually exclusive and have infinite length as clarified in cushman s 1990 discussion our focus is only on discrete structural hierarchies recently the spatial bivariate correlation structure of ln k was developed for bimodal media rubin 1995 multimodal media lu and zhang 2002 barrash and clemo 2002 and hierarchical multimodal media ritzi et al 2004 dai et al 2004a b ramanathan et al 2008 2010 importantly rubin 1995 derived expressions for the mean variance and spatial covariance of ln k for bimodal media in this approach the ln k is modeled with a continuous space function and the presence of units is modeled with an indicator space function in rubin 1995 the correlation structure of indicator random variables was assigned somewhat arbitrarily without specifying how the mean variance shape and range of the indicator correlation function are related to the volume proportion geometry and spatial organization of sedimentary unit types see also rubin and journel 1991 lu and zhang 2002 expanded rubin s 1995 expressions in order to include any number of modes see also barrash and clemo 2002 they used carle and fogg 1996 1997 approach in which the structure of the indicator random variables is directly defined by quantifiable physical attributes of unit types including volume proportions and mean lengths for the bimodal media they investigated the sensitivity of the composite variance of ln k to the volume proportions of units the difference in mean permeability across units and the variance in permeability within each unit as reviewed by ritzi and soltanian 2015 coordinated hydrogeologic and sedimentologic field studies have created new highly resolved data sets at a number of field sites located in different depositional settings this included highly resolved data characterizing the sedimentary architecture and related spatial variation in permeability within fluvial e g ritzi et al 2004 gershenzon et al 2015a b c alluvial e g dai et al 2005 and lake shoreline deposits e g kalinovich et al 2012 ritzi et al 2013 soltanian and ritzi 2014 these studies have created a body of literature studying the link between sedimentary architecture and heterogeneity in attributes such as k and sorption distribution coefficient kd anderson 1989 1991a b davis et al 1993 1997 allen king et al 1998 barrash and clemo 2002 biteman et al 2004 dai et al 2005 kalinovich et al 2012 ritzi et al 2013 soltanian and ritzi 2014 soltanian et al 2015a b the most important finding in this body of work is that the spatial bivariate correlation structure is essentially the cross transition probability structure defined by the sedimentary architecture because of that it has been possible to identify and model the separate influence of each scale of sedimentary architecture on the spatial correlation structure in these studies it has also been shown in these studies that geologic data more easily acquired than permeability and sorption distribution coefficient data can be used to better infer and model the spatial correlation structure at each scale and thereby improve the overall model see soltanian et al 2015a b c as reviewed by ritzi and soltanian 2015 a spatial bivariate statistic e g semivariogram can be very well approximated by γ ξ ζ h r j o i o 1 2 σ ξ ro ζ ro σ ξ ji ζ ji m ξ ro m ξ ji m ζ ro m ζ ji p ro h t ro j i h where the m ξ ro are the univariate sample means and σ ξ ro ζ ro are the univariate point sample variances ξ ζ or point covariances ξ ζ computed from subpopulations of the data per level i i e smaller scale unit type in other words the composite auto and cross sample semivariograms were very well approximated using only the spatial bivariate structure of the p ro h t ro j i h for cross transition probabilities see section 2 1 for definition of the transition probability thus the semivariograms grows with lag as grows the sample probability of transitioning across different smaller scale facies types and stabilizes with lag as does those sample cross transition probabilities in this article we introduce an inverse modeling approach that allows fitting sample statistics for the transition probabilities and covariances in smaller scale units and using geologic data to improve the estimation of transition probability structures for the largest lag distances in this work we focus on unconsolidated sediments of española basin new mexico specifically we focus on fitting models for the transition probabilities semivariograms and covariances at a lower hierarchical level to be used in developing a model for a higher level expressed as a function of those lower level models we follow an inverse methodology presented by dai et al 2004b in which lower level models for semivariograms covariances and transition probabilities are fitted with nested functions dai et al 2004b showed that the final global semivariogram and covariance models obtained from the estimated parameters compare well to the sample semivariogram and covariance here we use their approach to see how we can improve estimation of semivariogram covariance and transition probability models for outcrop data from española basin to estimate the spatial covariance structure of intrinsic or non intrinsic random functions from point or spatially averaged data samper and neuman 1989 described a cross validation method woodbury and sudicky 1991 modeled the experimental semivariogram data from the borden aquifer with an exponential function by the constrained simplex approach and the levenberg marquardt method separately kitanidis 1997 reviewed the methods for fitting functions to sample covariance models and the estimation criteria that might be used if the application of model functions is known the fitting process could have an estimation criterion based on that application for example if models are to be used for kriging and point estimation cross validation can be used with an estimation criterion based on differences between kriging estimates and observations if the models are to be used in analytically derived models for transport parameters e g macrodispersion and plume retardation an estimation criterion could be based on differences between computed and observed spatial moments of mass in the solute plume and on differences between the model functions and the sample covariances and transition probabilities following dai et al 2004b here we use a least squares estimation criterion and impose constraints so that the transition probability models obey probability laws the inverse problems are solved by the gauss newton levenberg marquardt method dai and samper 2004 this paper is organized as follows section 2 presents the univariate and spatial bivariate statistics analytical solution for transition probability as well as the composite covariance function and its integral scale section 3 outlines the field measured data for ln k and sedimentary architecture at española basin new mexico section 4 presents results and discussions finally section 5 highlights the main conclusions of this work 2 multiscale and hierarchical correlation models 2 1 univariate and spatial bivariate statistics ritzi et al 2004 developed a general form of a hierarchical multimodal spatial bivariate correlation structure while the model can be written with any number of hierarchical levels here we write it in the form of a macroform composite scale level ii made up of n mesoforms smaller scale level i filling space in mutually exclusive occurrences within depositional environments see section 3 for definition of macroforms and mesoforms the indicator random variable i k x is written as 1 i k x 1 if unit k occurs at location x 0 otherwise then the composite log permeability y x can be expressed as 2 y x k 1 n i k x y k x where y k x represents ln k within units if the volume proportion or indicator of facies k is defined as p k k 1 2 n then k 1 n p k 1 and the expected value of i k is equal to p k the composite mean m y and variance σ y 2 of y x are see ritzi et al 2004 soltanian et al 2015c d 3 m y k 1 n p k m k 4 σ y 2 k 1 n p k σ k 2 1 2 k 1 n i k n p k p i m k m i 2 where m k and σ k 2 are facies mean and variance of y k x respectively as applied to measuring spatial continuity of facies distributions the transition probability uses indicator variables to quantify the conditional probability t ki h ϕ of transitioning in direction ϕ from sedimentary unit type i to type k 5 t ki h ϕ pr i i x h ϕ 1 and i k x 1 pr i k x 1 carle and fogg 1996 ritzi 2000 as per ritzi et al 2004 the composite spatial correlation of y x can be expressed by volume proportions transition probabilities and in or cross facies correlation of y k x 6 γ y h ϕ k 1 n i 1 n γ ki h ϕ p k t ki h ϕ where γ y h ϕ is the composite semivariogram in ϕ direction and γ ki h ϕ is the in facies semivariogram in ϕ direction if k i and cross facies if k i similarly the composite centered covariance c y h ϕ can be written as 7 c y h ϕ k 1 n i 1 n c ki h ϕ m k m i p k t ki h ϕ m y 2 where c ki h ϕ is the covariance in ϕ direction within or across unit types eq 7 is an exact identity in relating the composite covariance to the univariate and bivariate statistics for units defined at lower hierarchical levels with n 2 eqs 4 and 7 become the same as those by rubin 1995 and lu and zhang 2002 for the bimodal media ritzi et al 2004 illustrated the exact equivalence of the right and left hand sides using sample statistics computed from exhaustively sampled data representing cross bedded sediments in a point bar deposit also see ritzi et al 2013 in which the same analysis was performed for data from borden research site dai et al 2004a similarly showed the equivalence of the right and left hand sides using data used in this study from sediments of española basin here we assume that the cross covariances have negligible contributions i e c ki h ϕ 0 k i this is a common assumption e g rubin 1995 which is supported by dai et al 2004a b and ritzi et al 2004 in section 4 1 1 we will show that this is a justified assumption therefore we can write eq 7 in the following form see dai et al 2004a b 8 c y h ϕ k 1 n p k c kk h ϕ t kk h ϕ 1 2 k 1 n i k n m k m i 2 p k p i t ki h ϕ eqs 3 4 6 and 8 are general formulations for composite mean variance semivariogram and covariance of multimodal y x the transition probabilities in 6 and 8 can be approached with markov chain model presented below 2 2 analytical solution for transition probabilities three dimensional 3d markov chain model can be represented by a one dimensional 1d markov chain model carle and fogg 1997 lu and zhang 2002 thus the continuous lag transition probability matrix t in ϕ direction is written as 9 t h ϕ t 11 h ϕ t 12 h ϕ t 1 n h ϕ t 21 h ϕ t 22 h ϕ t 2 n h ϕ t n 1 h ϕ t n 2 h ϕ t nn h ϕ e r h ϕ where r is a n n transition rate matrix whose entry rkj denote conditional rates of change per unit length from unit types k to i in ϕ direction 10 r r 11 r 12 r 1 n r 21 r 22 r 2 n r n 1 r n 2 r nn if r is known the transition probability matrix t can be evaluated by eigenvalue analyses let η j j 1 n be eigenvalues of the transition rate matrix r and z j j 1 n be their corresponding spectral component matrices which are computed by 11 z j m j η m i r m j η m η j where i is the identity matrix using spectral matrices the transition probability matrix is written as 12 t h ϕ j 1 n e η j h ϕ z j in order to obtain an analytical formulation for the transition probabilities we apply two assumptions below i the transition probability depends on volume proportions and therefore the off diagonal transition probabilities are computed using carle and fogg 1996 13 t ki h ϕ 1 t kk h ϕ p i 1 p k for i k differentiating eq 13 with respect to h ϕ at h ϕ 0 and assuming the embedding coefficients of unity following carle and fogg 1996 and ritzi 2000 the off diagonal transition rates are written as 14 r ki r kk p i 1 p k p i l k ϕ 1 p k for i k where l k ϕ is the mean length of the category k along lines in the direction ϕ ii the juxtapositional tendencies between categories k and i are symmetric in the direction ϕ see carle and fogg 1997 and thus we have 15 t ki h ϕ p i p k t ik h ϕ for i k 16 r ki p i p k r ik for i k therefore r ki r kk p i 1 p k p i l k ϕ 1 p k for i k by using 14 and 16 we can rewrite the transition rate matrix as 17 r 1 l 1 ϕ p 2 l 1 ϕ 1 p 1 p n l 1 ϕ 1 p 1 p 1 l 1 ϕ 1 p 1 p 2 1 l 1 ϕ 1 p 1 p n l 1 ϕ 1 p 1 p 1 l 1 ϕ 1 p 1 p 2 l 1 ϕ 1 p 1 p n 1 l 1 ϕ 1 p 1 1 λ i p 1 1 p 2 p n p 1 p 2 1 p n p 1 p 2 p n 1 where λ i l 1 ϕ 1 p 1 which is in fact the indicator correlation scale to compute eigenvalues of r we have det r η i 0 or 18 p 1 1 λ i η p 2 p n p 1 p 2 1 λ i η p n p 1 p 2 p n 1 λ i η 0 by applying properties of determinants for row and column operations and i 1 n p i 1 eq 18 is written as 19 1 λ i η 0 0 0 1 λ i η 0 p 1 p 2 λ i η 0 therefore one can write 20 η 1 λ i η n 1 0 and the matrix r has eigenvalues η 1 0 η 2 1 λ i and n 2 repeated eigenvalues of 1 λ i then we can compute spectral component matrices with 11 21 z 1 p 1 p 2 p n p 1 p 2 p n p 1 p 2 p n z 2 1 p 1 p 2 p n p 1 1 p 2 p n p 1 p 2 1 p n substituting eq 12 with the computed eigenvalues and spectral component matrices we obtain an analytical solution for the transition probabilities as 22 t ki h ϕ p i δ ki p i e h ϕ λ i for k i 1 n where δ ki is the kronecker delta 2 3 composite covariance function and integral scale the general shape of covariance function could be determined by the variance in length of unit types as per ritzi 2000 in nature unit length distributions are typically erlangian guin and ritzi 2008 soltanian et al 2015a b with a coefficient of variation of the order of unity which gives rise to exponential like transition probability structures white and willis 2000 ritzi 2000 ritzi and allen king 2007 field studies conducted in different deposits with highly resolved data have shown that the correlation structures could be parsimoniously represented by exponential structures one for each level of the hierarchy ritzi et al 2004 dai et al 2005 ritzi et al 2013 soltanian and ritzi 2014 ritzi and soltanian 2015 therefore here we consider an exponential function for the auto covariance c kk h ϕ as 23 c kk h ϕ σ k 2 e h ϕ λ k for k 1 n where λ k is the integral scale substituting 8 with 22 into 23 we obtain the composite covariance function in ϕ direction as 24 c y h ϕ k 1 n p k 2 σ k 2 e h ϕ λ k k 1 n p k 1 p k σ k 2 e h ϕ λ k λ i λ k λ i 1 2 k 1 n i k n m k m i 2 p k p i e h ϕ λ i the composite integral scale λ y is then defined using the formula below see dagan 1989 and soltanian and ritzi 2014 soltanian et al 2015e5 25 λ y 1 σ y 2 0 c y h d h incorporating 24 into 25 results in 26 λ y k 1 n p k 2 σ k 2 λ k k 1 n p k 1 p k σ k 2 λ k λ i λ k λ i 1 2 k 1 n i k n m k m i 2 p k p i λ i k 1 n p k σ k 2 1 2 k 1 n i k n m k m i 2 p k p i from 26 one can see that λ y depends on volume proportions variances and integral scales of y k x and the indicator correlation scale λ i more information about this equation and the relationship between different parameters are found in dai et al 2004b following dai et al 2004b here we fit the model functions to the sample covariance and transition probability in horizontal y and vertical z directions an inverse modeling method developed by dai et al 2004b is applied here to estimate the variances and integral scales for covariance of each unit volume proportions and indicator correlation scales of transition probability functions finally using estimated parameters we obtain the composite covariances in horizontal and vertical directions that can represent the spatial correlation structure of the measured permeability accurately representing the correlation structure has important practical implications in developing spatial bivariate correlation models for use in estimation simulation or analytical derivation of macrodispersivity and retardation factor models see soltanian et al 2015a b 3 sedimentary architecture outcrop analogue studies have been used in both reservoir and aquifer characterization e g goggin et al 1992 davis et al 1993 ritzi et al 2000 dai et al 2005 ritzi et al 2013 in these studies sedimentary units were mapped and digitized with indicator variables and permeability was measured with for example an air permeameter we chose an outcrop in the española basin new mexico which was mapped and previously studied by smith 2000 kuhle and smith 2001 and gaud et al 2004 see fig 2 in dai et al 2005 showing map and photos of the outcrop the outcrop is 370 m long approximately along structural strike and exposes 30 m of stratigraphic thickness the surveyed lithofacies at level i permeability measurements are shown in fig 1 the sediments represent both channel and inter channel deposits middle miocene tesuque formation are both ribbon form and tabular and vary in grain size from clay to sandy gravel gaud et al 2004 dai et al 2005 studied unconsolidated sediments of the española basin to address the following practical issues 1 they showed there is not a unique hierarchy to classify sediments and that different classifications could be obtained based on textural attributes here we follow their classification which is described below 2 they discussed how maps of exposed sedimentary units could be used to generate data indicating lithology which could be used to develop transition probability models for sedimentary units also they showed how these models significantly improve equivocal sample semivarigrams see also ritzi et al 2013 3 finally they addressed issues related to partially exposed sedimentary units in outcrops and they presented a bayesian based method for reducing this bias in estimating volume proportions and mean and variance in length of sedimentary units see also white and willis 2000 ramanathan et al 2008 2010 we describe the outcrop deposits using a hierarchical framework following dai et al 2005 see also scheibe and freyberg 1995 such a framework related to hydrogeologically relevant scales dai et al 2005 considered three levels of hierarchical level for simplicity here we only consider two tiered hierarchy defined mainly based on the gain size sedimentary textures and structures in smaller scale level i we consider four unit types illustrated in fig 1 and table 1 note that this hierarchy represents one organizational framework and others are possible see dai et al 2005 although the log permeability distribution is weakly multimodal there are statistically significant differences in the univariate statistics on log permeability among the populations taken within each sedimentary unit see fig 4 in dai et al 2005 showing the cumulative frequency of ln k data at each hierarchical level the modes of ln k change at each hierarchical level in the organization of the sediment gaud et al 2004 below we briefly describe the relevant hierarchical levels considered in this work with smaller scale level i presented in table 1 for more information you may read dai et al 2004a ritzi et al 2004 soltanian and ritzi 2014 2018 soltanian and ritzi 2014 level i mesoforms table 1 shows four mesoforms units this units are formed by microforms the detail description of microforms could be found in dai et al 2005 mesoforms are bounded by surfaces across which there are distinct changes in microform types or their proportion orientation and average grain size the statistics of permeability data for mesoforms are in table 1 the proportion and mean length of mesoforms scale calculated from the indicator data shown in fig 1a are listed in table 2 level ii macroforms mesoforms are organized into macroforms which are the largest feature representing the cumulative effect of multiple depositional events over a long period of time here we have a macroform scale composed of channel and inter channel deposits 4 results and discussions in presented results below we will fit the model functions to the covariances and transition probabilities in the horizontal and vertical directions an inverse methodology developed by dai et al 2004b is applied to estimate the facies variances and integral scales as well as volume proportions and indicator correlation scales finally we will input all of the estimated parameters to obtain the composite covariances in horizontal and vertical directions we will analyze the contributions from the auto and cross terms as well the results are compared with the covariance model developed with a single finite integral scale 4 1 spatial correlation in horizontal direction 4 1 1 covariances we used the ln k data and computed facies sample covariances in the horizontal y direction then an exponential function was fitted to individual sample covariances to do the fitting we used an inverse method by dai et al 2004b by fitting components transition probability and local covariance of the hierarchical model with a nested function we used a least squares criterion along with parameter defining prior information and other weighted constraints as the objective function of the inverse model the model was solved by the gauss newton levenberg marquardt method the estimated parameters in this approach include parameters defining correlation functions such as structural ranges variance or proportion and also weights although the parameter estimation tool is robust and can work automatically not everything in inverse approach is automatic nor should it be carrera and neuman 1986 dai et al 2004b 2014 trial and error is still carried out in the estimation procedure by manually modifying the parameter bounds initial parameter values and the initial weighting coefficients to the prior information personal judgment helped us to choose a group of optimal parameters based on model parsimony values of objective functions and the coefficients of variation for parameters the estimated parameters for level i mesoform facies covariance models are listed in table 3 and the fitting results are plotted in fig 2 the estimated volume proportions in table 3 are close to what we calculated from indicator data using whole outcrop data in table 2 as shown in fig 2 the auto covariances start from the facies variances at zero lag distances and decrease to zero along the exponential curve as lag distance increases thus the estimated variances σ k 2 are the same as or close to the unit variances listed in table 2 the cross covariances start from zero at the lag distance zero and fluctuate around zero line with a decreasing trend they can only fit to a straight line with zero values this in fact justifies the assumption of ignoring the cross covariances and is consistent with results of prior studies see ritzi et al 2004 dai et al 2004a b we found that the estimated integral scales are positively correlated to volume proportions and the mean lengths through λ k 0 089 2 934 p k and λ k 0 907 0 236 l k respectively with a correlation coefficients higher than 0 96 the implication is that the larger the mean length the larger the proportion and the integral scale the high correlation coefficients between integral scale and mean length or volume proportion indicate that integral scale is a scale dependent parameter and it mainly defined by the proportion and mean length or thickness of sedimentary units note that unit types f fines in table 1 mainly distributes on the top of the outcrop and there are only 30 permeability measurements were collected there this is related to practical problems in measuring low permeability with air permeameter 4 1 2 transition probabilities transition probability functions can be obtained in three ways from i indicator data corresponding to locations of permeability measurements ii indicator data obtained on the whole outcrop and iii geological interpretation see carle and fogg 1996 ritzi 2000 the indicator data corresponding to the permeability measurements were used to compute the sample transition probabilities in horizontal direction using t progs carle 1999 then the transition probabilities were fitted with exponential functions we estimated the indicator correlation scale λ i and four mesoforms volume proportions with the inverse model by dai et al 2004b the estimated volume proportions are listed in table 3 the resulting λ i is 6 95 m the fitting results are plotted in fig 3 we also used the indicator data measured on the whole outcrop to compute the sample transition probabilities in horizontal direction the transition probabilities were again fitted with exponential functions the estimated volume proportions are those listed in table 3 the indicator correlation scale is 12 2 m λ i which is larger than when indicator data from permeability locations are used using indicator data of the whole outcrop provide a better estimation for transition probabilities however as it is clear in fitting results plotted in fig 5 fig 4 the sample transition probabilities still show some noise by using geological interpretation or geological conjecture combining the sedimentologists systematic analysis we computed the mean lengths of the four units using the embedding coefficients following approach by carle and fogg 1996 and ritzi 2000 then we calculated the indicator correlation scale the results are listed in table 4 we assumed exponential functions for the transition probabilities and derived a uniform indicator correlation scale here we use a mean indicator correlation scale to evaluate the model indicator scale as λ i 1 n k 1 n λ ik 12 79 m which is close to what we obtained using indicator data on the whole outcrop with volume proportions and model indicator scales defined by geological interpretation we obtain auto and cross transition probabilities 4 1 3 composite covariance using the estimated parameters of local covariance and transition probability models we computed the composite integral scale in horizontal direction with eq 26 as λ y of 3 81 m we modeled the composite covariance with a single exponential function as 31 c y h σ y 2 e h λ y from the composite covariance in eq 24 we can see that sum of the first two terms derived from the first term in eq 8 represents auto covariances of y k x weighted by the volume proportion and auto transition probabilities therefore this sum is called the auto term the third term in 24 corresponds to the second term in 8 which represents the expected difference in y k x or the contrast in the mean across the unit boundaries weighted by the cross transition probabilities therefore it is called the cross term the relative contributions of these terms to the composite covariance are computed by using the estimated parameters the results are shown in figs 5 and 6 in fig 5 one can see that when lag distance λ y 3 81 m the auto term decays to zero and only the cross term contributes to the composite covariance when the lag distance λ y both terms contribute to the covariance structure the covariance model with hierarchical structure model cy better represents the sample covariance structure and the correlation scale than the unimodal model with a single finite integral scale we also computed the covariance model using proportions and indicator correlation scale estimated from the indicator data measured on the whole outcrop fig 6 summarizes the results in which the auto term decays to zero and only the cross term contributes to the composite covariance the covariance model with hierarchical structure model cy again fits to the sample covariance better than the unimodal model finally we compare three methods for estimating the sample covariance in the first model model a hereafter the transition probabilities were estimated based on the indicator data corresponding to the location of permeability measurements in the second model model b hereafter the transition probabilities were estimated with the indicator data from whole outcrop model b has a better defined transition probability structure than model a compare figs 3 and 4 showing better definitions for sample transition probabilities when indicator data of whole outcrop is used in the third model model c hereafter the transition probabilities were estimated from the geologic interpretations estimated parameters in table 4 the results are presented in fig 7 in model a the indicator correlation scale was underestimated comparing model a b and c we see that model b and c are nearly equal in all lag distances however at small lag distance model a fits the sample covariance better than both b and c however at larger lag distance model b and c with larger indicator correlation scales can better represent the composite sample covariance therefore permeability covariance structure is not well represented unless data locations allow proper definition of the transition probabilities of the units there is value in estimating transition probability model parameters using data on sedimentary architecture e g model b since geologic data are more abundant than permeability measurements also there are practical issues in measuring permeability on outcrop exposures such as accessibility and taking low permeability measurements another important point to consider is with regard to the applicability of models a b and c in predicting transport parameters such as macrodispersivity for example having the same variance the macrodispersivity derived from lagrangian based models for solute spreading is directly proportional to the composite integral scale λ y and the particle displacement variance is directly proportional to λ y 2 see sudicky 1986 dagan 1989 soltanian et al 2015c d therefore using covariance model a results in under estimation for both macrodispersivity and displacement variance additionally lagrangian based transport models that are derived using the hierarchical covariance structure defined by sedimentary architecture allow analyzing the contributions from auto and cross terms and therefore provide fundamental insight on how transport processes e g macrodispersion are defined by the correlation structure imparted by volume proportions and sizes of unit types see ramanathan et al 2008 2010 soltanian and ritzi 2014 soltanian et al 2015a b furthermore by quantitatively decomposing the macrodispersion into unit types related contributions we gain better understanding on how the time dependent rate of spreading is defined by the cross transition probability correlation structure imparted by the proportions and sizes of the larger scale unit types see ritzi and soltanian 2015 4 2 spatial correlation in vertical direction 4 2 1 covariances we used ln k data to compute local sample covariances in the vertical z direction following steps explained in previous section 4 1 1 we calculated local sample covariances here we also ignored the cross covariances and fitted the auto covariances with exponential functions the variances sills are equal to those in the horizontal direction thus we only estimated the local integral scales shown in table 5 the fitting results are plotted in fig 8 the general shape and the ranges of these auto covariances are explained by the estimated model similar to the results for the horizontal direction the estimated vertical integral scales are positively correlated to the facies proportions and the mean thicknesses with λ zk 0 055 0 345 p k and correlation coefficient of 0 9 the λ zk 0 026 0 131 l zk provide the relation between the estimated vertical integral relationship and the mean thicknesses with a correlation coefficient of 0 75 the high correlation coefficients between integral scale and mean length or proportion indicate that integral scale is a scale dependent parameter and it mainly defined by the mean length of sedimentary units since both horizontal and vertical integral scales are positively related to the proportions and the mean thicknesses they are positively related with one another in fact we found a fitting relation of λ zk 0 038 0 123 λ k between the estimated horizontal and vertical integral scales with a correlation coefficient of 0 97 4 2 2 transition probabilities we used the indicator data corresponding to the location of measured permeability to compute the sample transition probabilities in z direction then the transition probabilities were fitted in order to estimate the vertical indicator correlation scale and four volume proportions are fixed as those in horizontal direction the indicator correlation scale is 0 61 m and the fitting results are plotted in fig 9 the model with estimated parameters well captures the general shape and ranges of sample transition probabilities the indicator data from whole outcrop were also used to compute the sample transition probabilities in the vertical direction we only estimated the vertical indicator correlation scale and four volume proportions were fixed as those in horizontal direction the estimated indicator correlation scale is 0 72 m it is clear that indicator correlation scales are close weather using indicator data from whole outcrop or using indicator data corresponding to the locations of measured permeabilities therefore the fitting results were quite similar to those in fig 9 and we do not present them here by using geological interpretation or geological conjecture we first computed the mean thicknesses of the four units see table 3 and the embedding coefficients introduced by carle and fogg 1996 and ritzi 2000 to calculate the indicator correlation scales the results are listed in table 6 similar to section 4 1 2 we use the mean indicator correlation scales to compute the model indicator scale as λ zi 1 n k 1 n λ zik 1 15 m 4 2 3 composite covariance with the estimated parameters of local covariance and transition probability models the composite vertical covariance model in z direction is formed with eq 24 we also computed the composite integral scale in vertical direction as λ y 0 396 m using this value we modeled the composite covariance with an exponential function and a single finite integral scale unimodal model the relative contributions of the auto and cross terms to the composite hierarchical covariance are computed by using the estimated parameters all these results are plotted in fig 10 in fig 10 we can see that when the lag distance λ y 0 396 m the auto term decays to zero and only the cross term contributes to the composite covariance when lag distance λ y both terms contribute to the composite covariance the covariance model with hierarchical structure model cy is almost equal to the unimodal covariance model defined by a single integral scale it indicates that the composite covariance in the vertical direction could be modeled with unimodal function see samper and neuman 1989 woodbury and sudicky 1991 rubin et al 1999 however the hierarchical covariance model includes more physically based information about sedimentary architecture including volume proportions mean lengths of units the hierarchical model also provides a greater insight into how attributes of unit type assemblage influence the global spatial correlation which is clear here by the contributions of auto and cross terms e g rubin 1995 barrash and clemo 2002 ritzi et al 2004 therefore the hierarchical model can improve our ability to extrapolate the model into regions for which we have no permeability data but do have some knowledge of these attributes of the sediment this is not possible when fitting sample covariance with a unimodal function similar to previous section we also compare models a b and c in fig 11 we can see that model a and b are close note that in model a the transition probabilities were estimated based on the indicator data corresponding to the permeability measurements and the indicator correlation scale was slightly underestimated in model b the transition probabilities were estimated with the indicator data from whole outcrop the indicator scale in model c obtained from geological interpretation is over estimated 2 times higher than model a and b the estimated indicator correlation scales in models a and b can represent the covariance structure in a larger range of lag distances than model c thus the composite covariance in models a and b is the most representative of the special correlation of the log permeability in the vertical direction 5 conclusions we developed spatial correlation models for unconsolidated sediments of española basin new mexico in both horizontal and vertical directions by combining estimated volume proportions transition probabilities among categories and covariances of ln k data within sedimentary unit types organized into two hierarchical levels with four mesoforms at smaller scale level i and a macroform at larger scale level ii exponential functions were used to fit the transition probabilities and local covariances within mesoform units the fitting of the components of the hierarchical model written as nested exponential function was considered in developing a hierarchical covariance model the least squares criterion along with parameter prior information and other weighted constraints was used as the objective function of the inverse problem which was solved by the gauss newton levenberg marquardt method based on methods by dai et al 2004b importantly we found that permeability covariance structure is not well represented unless data locations allow proper definition of the transition probabilities of the units there is value in estimating transition probability model parameters using data on sedimentary architecture because geologic data are more abundant than permeability measurements also there are practical issues in measuring permeability on outcrop exposures such as accessibility and taking low permeability measurements we also found that the transition probability definition is underestimated if incomplete lithological data are used the definition is more representative with more data on sedimentary architecture the cross transitions from one unit types to another control the shape and provide better representation of the bivariate statistics specially in larger lag distances unimodal covariance model with a finite integral scale can provide reasonable representation for the bivariate statistics in the vertical direction the hierarchical models provide better estimates for the horizontal variability they show similar results to unimodal model in the vertical direction however the covariance models with hierarchical structure provide more fundamental information about the spatial variability for example the hierarchical models include more information about physical attributes of sediments including volume proportions mean lengths of units they also provide insights into how different attributes of unit type assemblage influence the composite correlation structure i e contributions of auto and cross terms therefore the hierarchical model can improve our ability to extrapolate the model into regions for which we have no permeability data but do have knowledge of physical attributes of the sediment this is in contrary to what we obtain by fitting sample covariance with a unimodal function we also found that because both vertical and horizontal integral scales are positively related to the facies proportions and the mean thicknesses they are also positively related to each other acknowledgements this work is partially funded by jilin university through a start up project awarded to the first

6844,uncertainty is a defining characteristic of hydrologic investigations with increasing recognition of parameter structural measurement and prediction uncertainty here we suggest that an additional form of uncertainty geo political uncertainty is locally important but commonly neglected we define geopolitical uncertainty in hydrology as indefiniteness of water balance processes the relative magnitude of hydrologic fluxes or causality as a consequence of complex international relations amongst riparians of a transboundary basin forced by internal economic political and nationalistic drivers as well as interactions amongst these drivers under a regime of non stationary climate we suggest that such geo political uncertainty has developed in the jordan river basin as a consequence of intentionally ambiguous language in the israel jordan peace treaty outstanding discussions regarding water allocations to the palestinian authority and lobbying by the powerful agricultural sector in the presence of economic motives requiring consumption of water these drivers promote securitization manifested as secrecy regarding water management and consumption by the upstream riparian which given non stationary climate opens a void of geo political uncertainty in which the relative importance of climate variability and change becomes indeterminate relative to changing water consumption thereby perhaps allowing the upstream riparian to increase water consumption the consequence of this geo political uncertainty for hydrologic studies is large water balance uncertainty inability to reproduce water consumption studies due to data secrecy and disagreement regarding the relative importance of pertinent drivers i e climate versus consumption greater acknowledgement and awareness of geo political uncertainty s impacts on hydrologic studies is needed as are concerted efforts to reduce this uncertainty for the benefit of transparent water dialogue among riparians and knowledge

supply and consumption data is collected by mekorot the water supply company owned by the government of israel and regulated by the israel water authority however recent work using these data contained a surprising caveat avni et al 2015 because of privacy and security issues the data cannot be released wine et al 2019 expresses a similar sentiment the israel water authority did not fulfill requests for contemporary surface water consumption data in the upper jordan river basin along the same lines klein 1998 writes that israel does not release complete information on runoff or water availability and use for some of the surface and groundwater resources they share with neighboring nations whereas as recently as 2006 water consumption in the kinneret s watershed was public knowledge givati and rosenfeld 2007 rimmer and salingar 2006 today this key component of the hydrologic budget is a secret this secrecy is a product of securitization which occurs when a transboundary issue specifically one such as water allocation that is not traditionally associated with national security is put forward as a threat necessitating extraordinary measures aggestam 2015 weinthal et al 2015 zeitoun 2007 however the implications of securitization of water resources in transboundary watersheds are not well known fischhendler 2015 spurred by this policy of secrecy which appears to be grounded in geo political concerns we ask in what way has geo politics influenced our understanding of the hydrology of the kinneret s headwaters furthermore in what ways might geo politics contribute to the tragedy of the commons currently playing out in the kinneret as it shrinks toward its lowest level in modern history to answer these questions we examine impacts of the israel jordan peace treaty ongoing discussions regarding water allocations to the palestinian territories and internal political forces 2 impacts of geo politics 2 1 effects of the israel jordan peace treaty one clause in the israel jordan peace treaty haddadin 2011 shamir et al 2009 requires that management and development of their water resources do not in any way harm the water resources of the other party though the precise definition of harm was allowed to remain ambiguous fischhendler 2008a fischhendler 2008b this clause refers to both issues of water quality and quantity on both issues there is a conflict between the short term domestic economic interests which demand maximizing domestic agricultural consumption of high quality low salinity water and the treaty requirements which according to their strictest interpretation would be highly restrictive when full 230 240 mcm yr 1 evaporate from the kinneret annually rimmer and givati 2014 rimmer et al 2011 wine et al 2019 leaving behind solutes in addition to evaporative concentration of solutes saline springs discharge to the kinneret gvirtzman et al 1997 rimmer 2003 rimmer and gal 2003 rimmer et al 1999 earth s lowest freshwater lake consequently maximizing inflow of high quality low salinity freshwater from the headwaters is necessary to maximize outflow from the lake and thereby minimize solute concentrations in lake kinneret the source of water transfers to the kingdom of jordan interpreted strictly this treaty stipulation might be viewed as requiring the israeli agricultural sector to reduce consumption of water for irrigation during droughts certainly if solute concentrations in the lake increased the treaty would require that headwaters inputs be allowed to flow into the lake not diverted out of the basin in contrast to the requirements provided by the treaty in a water limited context the motivation of the agriculture sector is to maximize profits best accomplished by increasing irrigated area within the basin or transferring water to other arable lands outside the basin furthermore from the perspective of agriculture it is most advantageous to irrigate with high quality headwaters water as opposed to water from the kinneret whose solute concentrations may be too high for certain crops and which may salinize irrigated soils consequently domestic motives of israeli agricultural interests may be at odds with obligations under the treaty however if reduced inflows to the kinneret result from climatic conditions resultant decreases in water quality supplied to jordan do not violate the treaty thus ambiguity regarding hydrologic process understanding in the jordan river headwaters engendered in part by secrecy regarding water consumption would appear to allow increased water consumption by the israeli agricultural sector in the presence of a policy of secrecy regarding water consumption the water quality impacts resulting from this increase in water consumption in the absence of evidence to the contrary could then be argued to result from climatic drivers similar to the aforementioned clause a second clause in the israel jordan peace treaty requires mutual assistance in the alleviation of water shortages this clause similarly is ambiguous in a way that contributes to geopolitical uncertainty given the economic importance of agriculture in water limited regions this clause seems to incentivize triggering a water shortage necessarily due to exogenous drivers that would require the other party to the treaty to cooperate with the affected party in alleviating such shortage indeed the upstream riparian of this treaty has focused its past work on climatic factors and impacts of lebanese water consumption givati and rosenfeld 2007 givati and rosenfeld 2013 while neglecting impacts of increasing groundwater pumping construction of new surface water impoundments and agricultural expansion for their part the kingdom of jordan has activated this clause following the flight of syrian refugees to jordan despite large increases in streamflow caused by the abandonment of syrian agriculture muller et al 2016 it is apparent that this clause in the presence of secrecy on the part of one or more upstream riparians encourages a relativistic understanding of hydrologic processes these two clauses both may contribute to government secrecy and opacity regarding water consumption making water balance modeling studies irreproducible due to unavailability of this data to outside scientists 2 2 effects of palestinian claims to jordan river water similar to water relations between israel and jordan those between the palestinian authority and upstream riparians are not static with palestinians claiming water rights to the lower jordan river whose flows are primarily diverted by israel jordan lebanon and syria benvenisti and gvirtzman 1993 brooks and trottier 2010 brooks and trottier 2011 brooks and trottier 2014 brooks et al 2013 elmusa 1995 messerschmid and selby 2015 shuval 2011 shuval 1992 zeitoun et al 2009 feitelson et al 2012 write climate change may be used by the parties to justify their bargaining positions indeed the upstream riparians including both israel and syria have invoked climate change as a cause of reduced streamflow emanating from the headwaters of the jordan river basin while neglecting effects of agricultural expansion dams and groundwater extraction givati and rosenfeld 2007 givati and rosenfeld 2013 haddadin 2011 given water scarcity in both palestine and israel together with the palestinians objective of obtaining additional water rights nathan and fischhendler 2015 a focus by the upstream riparians on climate transition toward more arid conditions would alleviate pressure to reduce water consumption while it has been suggested that desalinization may desecuritize water resources walschot 2018 this argument seems to neglect the high cost of desalinization which either party would prefer not to bear consequently a focus on climate change even in the modern era of desalinization would seem favorable for the upstream riparian that is to say the principle of equitable apportionment requires balancing of the needs of the communities that share the common resource benvenisti and gvirtzman 1993 however if climate change research is falsely co opted to explain decreasing water availability this effectively decreases the perceived size of the common resource thereby reducing the share to which the downstream riparian is entitled 2 3 effects of domestic politics secrecy regarding water consumption data may also be seen as stemming from a failure of water governance the failure in water governance in israel occurs when water managers lobbied by the agricultural sector prioritize over abstraction in pursuit of near term economic goals over sustainable policies that would protect the environment feitelson 2005 feitelson et al 2007 menahem 2007 this over abstraction for agriculture reflects a policy that despite high inter annual variability in precipitation and a water limited climate regards agricultural water consumption as a fixed constraint dery and salomon 1997 however if water consumption data are kept secret this may be seen as a strategy to shift blame for overexploitation of aquifers streams and lakes from government water managers whose traditional role is management of water resources in a stationary climate to climatic change drivers thereby gaining the short term economic and political benefits of resource exploitation while avoiding responsibility for environmental degradation 2 4 uncertainty due to secrecy surrounding water consumption data the void of information regarding water consumption in the jordan river headwaters then in the presence of widespread discussion of climate change leaves the upstream riparian as the only custodian of full hydrologic basin knowledge with a simultaneous obligation to objectivity despite economic incentives to maximize water use this apparent dissonance between the obligations of the upstream riparian in a transboundary basin and domestic economic motives perhaps allow the upstream riparian to claim or exaggerate the importance of a water shortage due to climatic reasons even if the true root cause of the shortage is increased water consumption by the upstream riparian once such a water shortage has been created the pie has effectively shrunken for all parties thus this shrinkage of the pie whose magnitude is declared by and can only be verified by the upstream riparian then justifies impinging upon the desired water allocation of the downstream riparian or voiceless common pool resources in this geopolitical situation which bears some though not full resemblance to tragedy of the commons hardin 1968 one of the biggest losers may be aquatic ecosystems desiccated due to economic incentives and the apparent incentive of each party to demonstrate the more severe water shortage certainly the consequence is large uncertainty regarding the water balance in not only the affected watershed but also more broadly in the region we argue that this geo political uncertainty is poorly acknowledged and addressed in the existing hydrologic literature 3 from securitization to an epistemological crisis and tragedy of the commons in conclusion by creating uncertainty regarding a key water budget component through securitization the policy of secrecy regarding water consumption data in the jordan river headwaters supplants hard

6844,uncertainty is a defining characteristic of hydrologic investigations with increasing recognition of parameter structural measurement and prediction uncertainty here we suggest that an additional form of uncertainty geo political uncertainty is locally important but commonly neglected we define geopolitical uncertainty in hydrology as indefiniteness of water balance processes the relative magnitude of hydrologic fluxes or causality as a consequence of complex international relations amongst riparians of a transboundary basin forced by internal economic political and nationalistic drivers as well as interactions amongst these drivers under a regime of non stationary climate we suggest that such geo political uncertainty has developed in the jordan river basin as a consequence of intentionally ambiguous language in the israel jordan peace treaty outstanding discussions regarding water allocations to the palestinian authority and lobbying by the powerful agricultural sector in the presence of economic motives requiring consumption of water these drivers promote securitization manifested as secrecy regarding water management and consumption by the upstream riparian which given non stationary climate opens a void of geo political uncertainty in which the relative importance of climate variability and change becomes indeterminate relative to changing water consumption thereby perhaps allowing the upstream riparian to increase water consumption the consequence of this geo political uncertainty for hydrologic studies is large water balance uncertainty inability to reproduce water consumption studies due to data secrecy and disagreement regarding the relative importance of pertinent drivers i e climate versus consumption greater acknowledgement and awareness of geo political uncertainty s impacts on hydrologic studies is needed as are concerted efforts to reduce this uncertainty for the benefit of transparent water dialogue among riparians and knowledge

impacts on water resources emanating from mountainous regions viviroli et al 2011 consequently despite the importance of common pool water resources such as lakes in water limited regions the relative influence of water consumption versus climatic variability or change as drivers of lake shrinkage remains vigorously debated aghakouchak et al 2015 arkian et al 2018 givati and rosenfeld 2007 inbar and bruins 2004 moore 2016 wine et al 2019 wurtsbaugh et al 2017 one major cause of this uncertainty is the so called death of stationarity in hydrologic time series milly et al 2008 milly et al 2015

an exemplar of the global debate raging around the primary causes of the desiccation of prized common pool water resources fig 1 while there is no disagreement that both climate and increasing water withdrawals impact the water balance in the jordan river headwaters markel et al 2014 rimmer and givati 2014 the relative contribution of each remains hotly contested with government scientists assigning primary responsibility to climate change and lebanese water use givati and rosenfeld 2007 markel et al 2014 rimmer and givati 2014 amidst suggestions of increasing drought bergaoui et al

resources in the kinneret s watershed are regarded as over exploited inbar and bruins 2004 quba a et al 2018 rosenthal et al 2009 wine et al 2019 with water managers euphemistically acknowledging that water consumption in the kinneret and its watershed is not adjusted to the replenishment sequence markel et al 2014 in this debate the health of aquatic ecosystems the distribution of water in a transboundary basin and responsibility for bearing the heavy costs to desalinate additional water hang in the balance to better understand the role of humans in modifying land surface hydrological processes anthropogenic water regulation is increasingly included in modeling exercises pokhrel et al 2012 in the case of those areas of the kinneret s watershed that are administered by israel water supply and consumption data is collected by mekorot the water supply company owned by the government of israel and regulated by the israel water authority however recent work using these data contained a surprising caveat avni et al 2015 because of privacy and security issues the data cannot be released wine et al 2019 expresses a similar sentiment the israel water authority did not fulfill requests for contemporary surface water consumption data in the upper jordan river basin along the same lines klein 1998 writes that israel does not release complete information on runoff or water availability and use for some of the surface and groundwater resources they share with neighboring nations whereas as recently as 2006 water consumption in the kinneret s watershed was public knowledge givati and rosenfeld 2007 rimmer and salingar 2006 today this key component of the hydrologic budget is a secret this secrecy is a product of securitization which occurs when a transboundary issue specifically one such as water allocation that is not traditionally associated with national security is put forward as a threat necessitating extraordinary measures aggestam 2015 weinthal et al 2015 zeitoun 2007 however the implications of securitization of water resources in transboundary watersheds are not well known fischhendler 2015 spurred by this policy of secrecy which appears to be grounded in geo political concerns we ask in what way has geo politics influenced our understanding of the hydrology of the kinneret s headwaters furthermore in what ways might geo politics contribute to the tragedy of the commons currently playing out in the kinneret as it shrinks toward its lowest level in modern history to answer these questions we examine impacts of the israel jordan peace treaty ongoing discussions regarding water allocations to the palestinian territories and internal political forces 2 impacts of geo politics 2 1 effects of the israel jordan peace treaty one clause in the israel jordan peace treaty haddadin 2011 shamir et al 2009 requires that management and development of their water resources do not in any way harm the water resources of the other party though the precise definition of harm was allowed to remain ambiguous fischhendler 2008a fischhendler 2008b this clause refers to both issues of water quality and quantity on both issues there is a conflict between the short term domestic economic interests which demand maximizing domestic agricultural consumption of high quality low salinity water and the treaty requirements which according to their strictest interpretation would be highly restrictive when full 230 240 mcm yr 1 evaporate from the kinneret annually rimmer and givati 2014 rimmer et al 2011 wine et al 2019 leaving behind solutes in addition to evaporative concentration of solutes saline springs discharge to the kinneret gvirtzman et al 1997 rimmer 2003 rimmer and gal 2003 rimmer et al 1999 earth s lowest freshwater lake consequently maximizing inflow of high quality low salinity freshwater from the headwaters is necessary to maximize outflow from the lake and thereby minimize solute concentrations in lake kinneret the source of water transfers to the kingdom of jordan interpreted strictly this treaty stipulation might be viewed as requiring the israeli agricultural sector to reduce consumption of water for irrigation during droughts certainly if solute concentrations in the lake increased the treaty would require that headwaters inputs be allowed to flow into the lake not diverted out of the basin in contrast to the requirements provided by the treaty in a water limited context the motivation of the agriculture sector is to maximize profits best accomplished by increasing irrigated area within the basin or transferring water to other arable lands outside the basin furthermore from the perspective of agriculture it is most advantageous to irrigate with high quality headwaters water as opposed to water from the kinneret whose solute concentrations may be too high for certain crops and which may salinize irrigated soils consequently domestic motives of israeli agricultural interests may be at odds with obligations under the treaty however if reduced inflows to the kinneret result from climatic conditions resultant decreases in water quality supplied to jordan do not violate the treaty thus ambiguity regarding hydrologic process understanding in the jordan river headwaters engendered in part by secrecy regarding water consumption would appear to allow increased water consumption by the israeli agricultural sector in the presence of a policy of secrecy regarding water consumption the water quality impacts resulting from this increase in water consumption in the absence of evidence to the contrary could then be argued to result from climatic drivers similar to the aforementioned clause a second clause in the israel jordan peace treaty requires mutual assistance in the alleviation of water shortages this clause similarly is ambiguous in a way that contributes to geopolitical uncertainty given the economic importance of agriculture in water limited regions this clause seems to incentivize triggering a water shortage necessarily due to exogenous drivers that would require the other party to the treaty to cooperate with the affected party in alleviating such shortage indeed the upstream riparian of this treaty has focused its past work on climatic factors and impacts of lebanese water consumption givati and rosenfeld 2007 givati and rosenfeld 2013 while neglecting impacts of increasing groundwater pumping construction of new surface water impoundments and agricultural expansion for their part the kingdom of jordan has activated this clause following the flight of syrian refugees to jordan despite large increases in streamflow caused by the abandonment of syrian agriculture muller et al 2016 it is apparent that this clause in the presence of secrecy on the part of one or more upstream riparians encourages a relativistic understanding of hydrologic processes these two clauses both may contribute to government secrecy and opacity regarding water consumption making water balance modeling studies irreproducible due to unavailability of this data to outside scientists 2 2 effects of palestinian claims to jordan river water similar to water relations between israel and jordan those between the palestinian authority and upstream riparians are not static with palestinians claiming water rights to the lower jordan river whose flows are primarily diverted by israel jordan lebanon and syria benvenisti and gvirtzman 1993 brooks and trottier 2010 brooks and trottier 2011 brooks and trottier 2014 brooks et al 2013 elmusa 1995 messerschmid and selby 2015 shuval 2011 shuval 1992 zeitoun et al 2009 feitelson et al 2012 write climate change may be used by the parties to justify their bargaining positions indeed the upstream riparians including both israel and syria have invoked climate change as a cause of reduced streamflow emanating from the headwaters of the jordan river basin while neglecting effects of agricultural expansion dams and groundwater extraction givati and rosenfeld 2007 givati and rosenfeld 2013 haddadin 2011 given water scarcity in both palestine and israel together with the palestinians objective of obtaining additional water rights nathan and fischhendler 2015 a focus by the upstream riparians on climate transition toward more arid conditions would alleviate pressure to reduce water consumption while it has been suggested that desalinization may desecuritize water resources walschot 2018 this argument seems to neglect the high cost of desalinization which either party would prefer not to bear consequently a focus on climate change even in the modern era of desalinization would seem favorable for the upstream riparian that is to say the principle of equitable apportionment requires balancing of the needs of the communities that share the common resource benvenisti and gvirtzman 1993 however if climate change research is falsely co opted to explain decreasing water availability this effectively decreases the perceived size of the common resource thereby reducing the share to which the downstream riparian is entitled 2 3 effects of domestic politics secrecy regarding water consumption data may also be seen as stemming from a failure of water governance the failure in water governance in israel occurs when water managers lobbied by the agricultural sector prioritize over abstraction in pursuit of near term economic goals over sustainable policies that would protect the environment feitelson 2005 feitelson et al 2007 menahem 2007 this over abstraction for agriculture reflects a policy that despite high inter annual variability in precipitation and a water limited climate regards agricultural water consumption as a fixed constraint dery and salomon 1997 however if water consumption data are kept secret this may be seen as a strategy to shift blame for overexploitation of aquifers streams and lakes from government water managers whose traditional role is management of water resources in a stationary climate to climatic change drivers thereby gaining the short term economic and political benefits of resource exploitation while avoiding responsibility for environmental degradation 2 4 uncertainty due to secrecy surrounding water consumption data the void of information regarding water consumption in the jordan river headwaters then in the presence of widespread discussion of climate change leaves the upstream riparian as the only custodian of full hydrologic basin knowledge with a simultaneous obligation to objectivity despite economic incentives to maximize water use this apparent dissonance between the obligations of the upstream riparian in a transboundary basin and domestic economic motives perhaps allow the upstream riparian to claim or exaggerate the importance of a water shortage due to climatic reasons even if the true root cause of the shortage is increased water consumption by the upstream riparian once such a water shortage has been created the pie has effectively shrunken for all parties thus this shrinkage of the pie whose magnitude is declared by and can only be verified by the upstream riparian then justifies impinging upon the desired water allocation of the downstream riparian or voiceless common pool resources in this geopolitical situation which bears some though not full resemblance to tragedy of the commons hardin 1968 one of the biggest losers may be aquatic ecosystems desiccated due to economic incentives and the apparent incentive of each party to demonstrate the more severe water shortage certainly the consequence is large uncertainty regarding the water balance in not only the affected watershed but also more broadly in the region we argue that this geo political uncertainty is poorly acknowledged and addressed in the existing hydrologic literature 3 from securitization to an epistemological crisis and tragedy of the commons in conclusion by creating uncertainty regarding a key water budget component through securitization the policy of secrecy regarding water consumption data in the jordan river headwaters supplants hard objective science with relativism thereby effecting epistemological questions regarding hydrologic research addressing issues of the relative importance of climate change versus direct anthropogenic impacts in the jordan river headwaters in turn this epistemological crisis triggers unprecedented uncertainty regarding the relative importance of key hydrological processes clouds the transparency necessary for building trust with downstream riparian stakeholders and prevents knowledge based management of common pool resources in contrast transitioning the present policy of data secrecy toward one of transparency would allow the hydrologic community to reproduce or perhaps falsify existing results advance hydrologic science on a range of globally relevant extremely challenging issues and regain trust in the objectivity reproducibility and veracity of the hydrologic literature in the jordan river headwaters region as it relates to the relative importance of climate change versus increases in groundwater pumping reservoir storage and agricultural water consumption such an outcome would improve the basis for negotiations and peaceful relations with downstream riparians while
