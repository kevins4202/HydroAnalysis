19395,the consumption of saline groundwater has contributed to a growing incidence of renal diseases particularly in coastal communities of india although reverse osmosis ro is routinely used to remove salt from groundwater conventional ro systems i e centralized systems using spiral wound ro elements have limited utility in these communities due to high capital and maintenances costs and lack of infrastructure to distribute the water consequently there is a need to develop an appropriate solution for groundwater treatment based on small scale mobile and community led systems in this work we designed a mobile desalination system to provide a simple platform for water treatment and delivery of goods to rural communities the system employs tubular ro membranes packed in a single low profile vessel which fits below the cargo space the low profile enables minimal intrusion on the space available for the transportation of goods pressure is delivered by a belt driven clutch pump powered by the engine water is treated locally by connecting the intake to the village well while the vehicle idles a combined numerical and experimental approach was used to optimise the module system design resulting in 20 permeate flux enhancement experimental results revealed that the system can produce 16 l per square meter of membrane area per hour lmh at a salinity level of 80 ppm from a 2000 ppm groundwater when it is feed at 1 m3 h at 8 bars this indicates that a vehicle equipped with 12 m2 of tubular ro membranes can deliver 1 m3 of drinkable water by using 0 9 l of diesel assuming eight such systems could be implemented in a community to fulfil the water demands for a village with 2000 residents a social business study revealed that a payback time of 2 5 years is achievable even if the sale price of the water is relatively low usd 0 18 rs 12 which is half of the lowest market price per 20 l including providing a goods transportation service at price of usd 5

introduction india is home to 17 5 of the world s population yet has access to only 4 of the global fresh water resources many of which are declining in both supply and quality wright and winter 2014 the water resources ministry of india reported that approximately 75 of india s drinking water is sourced from aquifers soni and pujari 2010 however 60 of these aquifers contain levels of total dissolved solids which exceed the taste threshold of 500 mg l with aquifers in the coastal regions of gujurat exceeding 1900 mg l fig 1 wright and winter 2014 in these areas particularly in coastal communities in gujarat the consumption of saline groundwater has contributed to a growing incidence in a suite of renal diseases including urolithiasis nephrolithiasis and ureterolithiasis lópez and hoppe 2010 in some areas centralized desalination plants have been installed to provide treated water however the problem with centralized solutions is that villagers accessing the treated water mostly women are still exposed to the drudgery of carrying the water back to the home chakravarty 2017 moreover as the communities most effected by saline groundwater represent the poorest quintile of agricultural workers with an average income of us 1 25 day there is limited disposable income to purchase treated water jacoby 2016 in addition the use of groundwater containing more than 2000 mg l of dissolved salts results in reduced crop yield and increased sodicity of the soil which further reduces in agricultural income nayar et al 2017 in response the indian government is committed to supply clean drinking water to all citizens nayar et al 2017 recent studies have reported that around 60 000 villages 80 million people in india do not have adequate access to clean water wright and winter 2014 in areas affected by high levels of saline groundwater it is estimated that 12 000 villages 15 million people kurup 2017 1 1 desalination technologies desalination technologies such as thermal phase change processes membrane processes or hybrids of these methods can be applied to brackish and seawater sources to produce potable water production greenlee et al 2009 in recent years reverse osmosis ro membrane technology overtook multi stage flash distillation msf as the leading desalination technology this shift can be attributed to several factors i according to many studies ro can now produce fresh water from seawater or brackish water at one half to one third of the cost of thermal processes e g distillation greenlee et al 2009 ii ro technology has the ability to remove between 95 and 99 of tds along with nearly 100 of heavy metals organic matter viruses and bacteria iii ro systems compact easy to operate maintain and have lower environmental impacts ahmad and schmid 2002 based on these same factors we have elected to investigate ro membrane technologies to develop a mobile brackish water desalination unit in this study 1 2 membrane module configurations table 1 compares brackish water ro desalination systems of varying sizes mega centralized medium small decentralized and mobile ro membrane configurations spiral wound tubular or hollow fibers and their performance most existing brackish water ro desalination systems use spiral wound elements which were originally developed for large scale centralized seawater groundwater and water recycling applications since the colloidal fouling tendency of an ro membrane is relative to the feedwater s salt density index sdi spiral wound modules used in typical ro systems require an sdi less than 5 while hollow fibre modules need a sdi of less than 3 the use of the spiral wound or hollow fibre module necessitates complex pretreatment processes in a traditional centralized plant due to the high sdi sdi 6 of seawater or saline groundwater riverol and pilipovik 2011 tubular membranes on the other hand are well suited to fluids with high viscosity and or suspended solids as their wide flow paths make them highly resistant to blocking pre treatment requirements are minimal in tubular membranes and can even be completely omitted making them more cost effective for small systems pci membranes 2017 it is worth noting that the tubular geometry can also benefit from performance boosts from hydrodynamic techniques such as secondary flows e g helix flow pentair 2017 taylor vortex flow taylor 1923 flow channel spacer inserts e g static rod yeh et al 2000 helical screw thread bellhouse et al 2001 and baffles teoh et al 2008 and two phase flow e g gas liquid flow pabby et al 2015 these techniques can enhance turbulence in the feed channel and improve the permeate flux by reducing the effect of concentration polarization and fouling li et al 2017a 1 3 desalination system due to the prevalence of chemical contamination in indian groundwater sources non governmental organizations have begun to install small 2 40 m3 day decentralized ro systems in fixed regional location wright and winter 2014 although ro is routinely used to remove salt from groundwater in small medium scale decentralized plants experience from villages in kodinar and mangrol shows that conventional ro systems have only limited utility in these communities due to a lack of local technical capacity resources and training wright and winter 2014 while some of these systems have been successfully operating for up to 5 years many have failed soon which in most cases is attributable to membrane fouling e g salt precipitation and membrane scaling after installation due to lack of proper maintenance or the inability to keep up with operational costs wright and winter 2014 greenlee et al 2009 the technical constraints are generally associated with the use of spiral wound ro elements such as pretreatment and chemical cleaning greenlee et al 2009 resource constraints are strained by the ongoing costs of power chemicals and replacement membranes additionally it is clear that in the absence of water distribution systems the usefulness of regional systems are limited by how far the users can the water for residents in remote areas with inadequate energy and water supply mobile decentralized water desalination system could solve many of the problems of fixed regional water supply facilities mobile decentralized systems can be incorporated into standard trucks or trailers and potentially provide the best solution in emergency situations however current mobile decentralized systems remain some problems all reported studies and commercialized mobile systems to date require a separate energy source to drive the system and their desalination system occupied the whole cargo space so power source unit adds significant capital cost and weight to the system limits the commercial ability of the system thus fully integrated mobile and multifunctional ro groundwater desalination platform represent a promising way forward for rural communities particularly with further technical improvement on membrane module and mobile system designs 1 4 social business model to achieve a sustainable community led systems social capital and sense of ownership can improve the effectiveness and the sustainability of community management of rural community managed water systems kelly et al 2017 hence we propose that the technology developed in this work lends itself to a so called social business model in the social business model the business runs as a non dividend organisation that is created with an objective to address and solves a social problem by applying business principles yunus et al 2010 three main features distinguish this model it endeavors to eliminate social problems and poverty it must be operated in a sustainable manner and all profits when they are made are to be reinvested into the business instead of being distributed among its shareholders social businesses model run very much like typical commercial enterprises where the target market and the market offerings products services are chosen before the business begins operations therefore to address the technical constraints a compact rectangular membrane module integrated with a mobile desalination system was developed and investigated in this paper to determine if it can provide a feasible and efficient solution meanwhile to address the social problems a social business model was developed to determine if it can provide a community based sustainable enterprise centred on goods transportation while also producing affordable drinkable water for villages 2 mobile desalination design the mobile groundwater desalination system proposed here provides a platform for the delivery of goods and services employs tubular membranes packed in a single or series parallel rectangular vessel s and can be fitted in the tray or cargo space of a vehicle the system consists of a vehicle a tata ace truck in this case study a pre screening component a membrane module a belt driven clutch pump and control accessories e g pressure regulating valve pressure relief valve as shown in fig 2 the process diagram shows the mobile system treats water extracted from a well by using a submersible pump the ro system uses mechanical energy from the vehicle s engine to drive a positive displacement pump from this pump the feed water is pressurized passed through a simple pre treatment unit e g screen and then enters the inlet distribution channel for the tubular membranes the desalinated permeate water is then collected in a reservoir while the reject stream goes back through the system upon arrival at a village or domicile the driver operator connects the pump intake to the water storage tank the product line to a drinking water receptacle and the reject concentrate line to discharge point since the mobile system was envisioned for remote agricultural areas where the feed water has tds of around 2000 ppm greenlee et al 2009 it has been designed to provide irrigation water or domestic washing water the treatment process commences by starting the engine and placing the vehicle in adjusted idle mode with optimum idle engine speed that couples the pump shaft with crank shaft at the end of the day after servicing multiple villages the membrane module is cleaned and sanitised using a solution of fresh water and citric acetic acid thus it is expected that this mobile ro membrane system is simple enough that it can easily be operated and maintained by a single person depending on the load capacity of the truck and the delivery task it might be worthwhile to let the truck carry groundwater to treat water intermittently when the truck is idling in traffic or during loading unloading of cargo due to the extra mass of water this operation mode would consume more fuel than normal deliveries but it could save fuel relative to normal deliveries plus a batch water processing mode 2 1 ro desalination module as shown in fig 3 this desalination module employs tubular ro membranes 12 5 mm in diameter supplied by pci membranes product code afc90 housed in 3 rectangular vessels designed to fit in the tray or cargo space of the vehicle the tubular membranes are arranged into modules each housing 66 pieces which can be casted in epoxy resin at each end multiple modules are connected with 3 in series and 4 in parallel giving 12 modules in the system and a total membrane area of 11 5 m2 the modules are operated in a cross flow configuration in that the feed water goes through the inside of the membrane tube with the permeate flow directed perpendicularly out of the membranes into an acrylic vessel the packing density and arrangement of the tubular membranes has been optimized to reduce the vertical profile of the rectangular vessel 0 165 m tall as shown in fig 4 to minimize the impact on the storage capacity of the vehicle to reduce the concentration polarization coefficient the length of each unit 0 432 m as shown in fig 4 was optimized by numerical analysis as shown in fig 4 b since the tubular membrane has a large diameter 12 5 mm in internal diameter and 13 5 mm in outer diameter it can reduce the requirement for pretreatment and is able to process feed waters with larger particles without blocking and irreversible fouling yeh et al 2011 high cross flow velocity can reduce the salt concentration polarization effect on the membrane surface mänttäri et al 2010 but also increase power consumption per litre of feed water therefore optimisation is required to determine the ideal balance between the installed module surface area and the velocities used the nominal maximum operating pressure of this module is designed to be 15 bars for treating brackish groundwater with 1000 4000 ppm salinity level the lower operating pressure reduces stress on the membranes and other parts of the module this allows light weight materials e g fibre reinforced plastics to be used in this module while maintaining structural integrity also light weight plastic pipes e g polyethylene and quick connect fittings e g polypropylene can be used to minimize the weight and cost of this system the details of the numerical and experimental analysis of this design are reported in the following sections 2 2 integrated truck and desalination module the tata ace mega was selected for this case study which is a 1030 kg cargo carrier from tata motors and has maximum engine output of 30 kw at 3750 rpm capable of a top speed of 80 km h a 30 l fuel tank is installed with a typical fuel economy of 21 km l giving an approximate range of 540 km per tank for an empty vehicle the dimensions of the membrane configuration are constrained by the bed of the tata ace 2140 mm length x 1430 mm width x 300 mm height which is the proposed location for the membrane unit to take off the power from tata ace mega for groundwater desalination a belt driven clutch pump can be installed on the engine by using mounting kits and driven via two belts from an add on crankshaft pulley the pump speed and discharge pressure are determined by revolutions per minute rmp of the engine under an added idle for water desalination mode by equipping with an automatic pressure regulating valve this device ensures a constant working pressure at 8 10 bars note that a piston pump would be more suitable for this application as it can work with water and other thin liquids including liquids containing abrasives however this system adds approximately 100 kg to the vehicle weight including a belt driven clutch pump 10 kg the membrane module 80 kg the associated pipework 5 kg and the remaining water in the module 5 kg this will decrease the fuel efficiency for the transportation of goods and have an associated effect on the range of the vehicle it has been noted that a 10 increase in gross vehicle weight corresponding to 100 kg for the tata ace mega results in a fuel efficiency decrease of 5 oh and park 2014 the truck will be able to access local sources of saline groundwater and deliver the treated water in 20 l bottles directly to clustered residences water sales would only be a small part of the revenue stream of course with the balance derived from commercial activities the delivery of a range of goods and services 3 numerical and experimentation methodology the performance of this ro desalination module was simulated by computational fluid dynamics cfd the computational model was developed using ansys fluent version 16 2 the permeate flux j and salt concentration profile c salt for varying operating pressures and feed velocities were obtained via a 3d cfd modelling domain which due to symmetry includes quarters of two diagonally adjacent tubular membranes the transmembrane flux was implemented into the simulation domain by our previous mass jump method to predict the performance of the tubular membrane lian et al 2016 this method enables evaluation of the effects of operating pressure salt concentration and crossflow velocity for both total flux and local flux along the membrane s length at steady state and under laminar flow the transport equations for the feed permeate of the membrane can be described by the following the continuity equation is given by 1 ρ v s m the momentum transport equation is expressed by 2 ρ v v p τ ρ g s v where s m and s v are 2 source terms representing the quantitative changes of mass and momentum on each side of membrane surface respectively these source terms can be written as 3 s m j a v a t r r o j a v a t r r i 4 s v j a v v a t r r o j a v v a t r r i where a v r o r i and v are the membrane area flow velocity inner radius and outer radius the volume of the element respectively j is the transmembrane mass flux calculated from the membrane permeability and transmembrane pressure 5 j k m p f p p π where k m represents the pure water permeability of the membrane with an average value of 0 0000263 kg m 2 h 1 pa 1 as was determined from the experiment section by circulating deionized di water as feed solution at pressure from 2 to 8 bars as shown in fig 9 a p f p p and π are the feed permeate and osmosis pressure the osmotic pressure can be expressed as 6 π i c r t where i is the dimensionless van t hoff index 1 8 for sodium chloride c is the salt concentration mol l 1 at the membrane surface for the calculated simulation cell r is the ideal gas constant 0 0821 l atm mol 1 k 1 and t is the temperature in kelvin 298 k 3 1 numerical simulation for these simulations a 1 2 m long multiple fibre bundle was investigated as shown in fig 5 a sweep method was used to achieve a unified mesh size 10 3 m along the axial direction of the membrane in the transverse direction a finer mesh is required at the liquid membrane interfaces for both the lumen and the shell side thus an inflation of the first layer s thickness of 2 10 5 m was selected to ensure higher resolution in zones where the concentration polarization and transport phenomena occur the variables simulated include inlet velocities pressures and feed salt concentrations summarized in table 2 different fiber lengths were set up to investigate modules in series e g 3 modules in series each with 0 4 m length for a total module length of 1 2 m for simulating modules in series the feed outlet condition including pressure salt concentration and flow rate was applied as the inlet feed condition for the next module 3 2 experimental setup as shown in fig 6 a the experimental rig consists of a full scale module with dimensions of 0 43 0 22 0 165 m length width height a circulating fluid loop a pump several pressure and flow sensors and a data acquisition system daq the feed tank as shown in fig 6 was filled with 20 l of a 1000 2000 3000 4000 ppm nacl solution and the feed conductivity was measured the pump was turned on to increase the feed flow to 1 5 10 l min with all permeate returning to the feed tank to ensure constant feed composition the pump speed and gate valve were adjusted until the retentate pressure reached from 2 to 10 bar in 2 bar increments to ensure stable salt concentrations in both lines samples were collected from both and the conductivity of each sample was measured and recorded along with the time using a portable conductivity meter this same process was carried out for the different feed salt concentrations e g 1000 2000 3000 and 4000 ppm nacl solutions each covering 2 4 6 8 and 10 bar pressure increments the experiment process and measurement readings were controlled and recorded by a supervisory control and data acquisition scada platform the change in salt concentration in both the feed c feed and the permeate c perm was determined using the correlation for the conductivity measurements using the calculated salt concentration values the salt rejection can then be found using eq 7 7 r 1 c p e r m c f e e d 4 results and discussion permeate flux distribution along the tubular membranes was simulated to optimise the length of tubular membranes for module design as shown in fig 7 the flux decreases along the axial location of tubular membranes due to increased osmotic pressure created by salt concentration polarization thus a module design with the shorter tubular membrane or multi stage can significantly reduce this negative effect the membrane length of each multi stage can be calculated by total length of the module 1 2 m was constrained by the size of truck bed divided by the number of stages n in the axial direction z axis by using the data from fig 7 derived from cfd the q p e r m m u l t i s t a g e and q p e r m s i n g l e s t a g e are the permeate flow rate l hour for the tubular membrane respectively were calculated as following eqs 8 and 9 8 q p e r m m u l t i s t a g e i 1 n 0 1 2 n j p e r m z π d m dz 9 q p e r m s i n g l e s t a g e 0 1 2 j p e r m z π d m dz the enhancement of permeate flow rate l hour by employing multi stages membrane can be obtained from the difference of the q p e r m m u l t i s t a g e and q p e r m s i n g l e s t a g e for instance average permeate flow rate can be enhanced from 0 63 l hour using a 1 2 m tubular membrane single stage to 0 71 l hour using 0 4 m long membrane 3 stages as shown in fig 7 b this is because the feed solution can be mixed in the manifold between each stage unit however increasing the number of stages in the axial direction will increase the weight and cost of the module as more manifolds or membrane housing are required resulting in a techno economic design trade off therefore a 3 stage module design 0 4 m long membrane was determined for this module design resulting in 12 permeate flux enhancement compared to 1 stage module 1 2 m long membrane further increase in module stage number will have negligible improvement on permeate flux but will result in a significant increase in weight of module the permeate flux of the optimized module can be simulated by selecting various feed flowrates between 2 5 and 100 l min within a range of feed pressures 2 20 bars as shown in fig 8 it can be seen that increasing feed flow rate has a more significant effect on permeate flux at higher operating pressure due to its ability to decrease concentration polarization this indicates that when this module is operated at or above 10 bars flow rates above 10 l min per module or 40 l min per system noting that each system has 4 modules in parallel are recommended thus 20 improvement in water production can be achieved by this optimized module design and operating parameter the permeate mass flux of the module was determined by the experiment for different operating pressures and feed salt concentrations summarized in fig 9 the results indicate that the permeate flux again mainly depends on the operating pressure and 8 16 lmh can be achieved from this module for treating groundwater with salinity levels of 1000 4000 ppm notably the feed velocity has only a slight linear effect on the permeate flux according to the experimental results this can be explained by the linear increase in the reynolds number in the tubular membranes from 50 to 150 when increasing the feed velocity from 1 5 to 7 l min higher reynolds numbers reduce concentration polarization but increasing the flow velocity will consume more pumping power the experimental results show good agreement with the cfd results as shown in fig 10 there are greater discrepancies between the experimental and cfd results for 4 bars and 6 bars the possible reason is using the average the membrane permeability 2 65 10 5 kg m 2 h 1 pa 1 for the cfd analysis at different pressure derived from fig 9 a the average permeability used in the cfd is close to actual tested membrane permeability at 2 bars and 8 bars 2 7 10 5 kg m 2 h 1 pa 1 but it is slightly higher than the actual tested membrane permeability at 4 bars and 6 bars 2 5 10 5 kg m 2 h 1 pa 1 the flow meter was further calibrated by using the bucket and stopwatch method the results give an average uncertainty of about 5 in the mass flow range of 1 10 l min the salt rejection of the module was tested by measuring the salt levels of the permeate and using eq 7 the test on permeate water quality salinity level during the experiment revealed that a salt rejection rate of 96 can be achieved by this module across all concentrations as shown in fig 11 which is less than the salt rejection 99 stated by the manufacturer this is because the type of membrane used in the module was designed to withstand pressures up to 60 bars salt rejection and pressure have a positive relationship so if higher pressures were used i e a pressure much greater than 15 bars the salt rejection would also increase and could potentially reach 99 nevertheless excellent quality of water can be obtained from this ro module the salt removal by the module is more than enough to achieve a permeate with less than 500 ppm in tds concentration indian drinking water standards requirement for potable water for all tested feed concentrations in this section numerical and initial experimental studies are conducted to optimise the mobile desalination system while the proposed technology can provide safe drinking water organizations may still face challenges in making them financially sustainable thus to investigate the viability of the mobile system a social business study of this mobile desalination system was reported in the next section 5 social and economic analysis the lean canvas approach rosário cabrita et al 2016 is used to develop a preliminary social business model to increase the chance of the mobile desalination system to be successfully implanted into the rural communities of gujarat the social business model will be based on implementing the mobile desalination trucks in one village in junagadh with a population of 2000 people note that more than 50 of villages in junagadh have population of 1000 to 2000 assuming that each resident demands 3 l day of drinking water wright and winter 2014 the village demands 6000 l day the lean canvas method of developing a business model considers the problem customer solution unique value proposition revenue and cost streams and key metrics of the business each aspect of the lean canvas is addressed below to address the problems as described in the introduction section providing a mobile desalination truck will allow villagers to produce drinking water directly from wells and assists in transporting crops goods by creating delivery services while desalinating water at various villages buyers will contact owners of the truck via short message service sms or online logistic platforms and will submit an order for good transportation or service to desalinate water in their village this multipurpose equipment can create better connectivity between villages for greater access to clean water and more efficient distribution of crops goods the target customers and users are rural communities located far away from centralized desalination systems and only have access to surface water or groundwater the tata trust could be a customer especially now that they have established their tata water mission to bring water initiatives to 12 000 villages in the next three years the early adopters of the mobile desalination truck would most likely be farmers who need to transport their crops to market and also need access to clean water which can be produced by the truck the social and economic impact of the desalination truck will be the key metrics to reflect the contribution of the innovation to rural communities the social impact will be measured as a percentage of residents with daily access to safe and contamination free drinking water also since water can be provided near habitats or can be received at home the eliminated load of carrying back water from the source to home can be regarded as another social benefit chakravarty 2017 the economic impact will be measured based on the transactions made between desalination truck owners and customers drinking water consumers on demand booking platform for mini trucks 5 1 system cost analysis the capital expenditure required for the mobile desalination truck produced from a range of suppliers alibaba 2017 pci membranes 2017 originwater 2017 tata 2017 as shown in table 3 the capital expenditure for one mobile desalination truck is usd 7900 or rs 527 000 note the conversion is 1 rs 0 015 usd it is important to take into consideration that the expected lifetime of the system is estimated to be 10 years while that of the membranes of the ro unit have a life of only 5 years this means that the ro membranes will be replaced after years 5 10 and the membrane replacement cost will be considered in the following economic analysis as each truck has 12 m2 of membrane area the truck is able to produce 192 l hr based on the experimental results discussed in section 3 3 the results in table 4 show that the system can be more cost effective if the operation hours increase this is due to fewer trucks 8 trucks will be required to produce 6000 l day resulting in lower capital expenditure however the drawback of operating for 4 h per session is that the truck will not be able to take as many orders from the freight logistic platform during the rest of 4 h the average number of orders and travel distance are assumed as shown in table 5 based on the data provided by indian s logistics industry operated by online platforms thus the total investments including the capital investment fuel consumption and maintenance cost are outlined in table 4 the hydraulic power required for the operating conditions 8 bars 40 l min is calculated to be 0 5 kw based on eq 10 10 p h k w q f h ρ g 3 670 10 6 where the feed flow rate q f was set at 2 4 m3 hr 40 l min and the required head h is 80 m based on a feed pressure of 8 bar the motor power fuel consumption rate may be calculated as the hydraulic power divided by the pump efficiency assumed to be 70 and motor efficiency assumed to be 40 11 p m k w p h η p η m thus the fuel consumption rate of the desalination system would be 1 8 kw indicating 9 4 kwh of the fuel energy is required to produce 1 m3 of drinking water the other main cost of operating the desalination truck is due to transporting goods via an intra city freight logistics platform e g moovo porter the fuel consumption costs for good transportation depend on the travel distance the loads and the fuel efficiency of the truck the travel distance for each operation mode was assumed in table 4 and the fuel efficiency of 21 km l with a payload capacity of 1030 kg was claimed by tata motors thus if mode 3 is used the distance traveled during one day is 100 km which uses 4 7 l of diesel fuel based on the truck s fuel efficiency 5 2 revenue stream and discussion sources of revenue for the owner of the truck will be from selling the produced clean water and services of transporting goods the price of the water sold is made to cover the cost of water production and delivery as well as the revenue difference between producing water and providing freight transportation service a detailed levelized cost of water lcow formula was applied in this system analysis as given by eq 12 and 13 which takes into account the capital cost of the entire system cc operating and maintenance costs omc and the fuel cost fc li et al 2017b the cost of desalinating 1 m3 of brackish water using this system can be calculated as follows 12 l c o w u s d m 3 c c c r f o m c f c u s d q m 3 where crf is the capital recovery factor defined in eq 13 13 c r f i 1 i n 1 i n 1 where i represents interest rate with a value of 6 and the number of periods 10 years used in the calculations will be equal to the useful life of a utility truck which best represents the mobile desalination truck thus the lcow of water is usd 4 5 m3 usd 0 09 per 20 l compared to centralized ro plants even the lcow of water for the mobile desalination truck is very high however the revenue of the system are not just water treatment as outlined in table 5 the other revenue streams and social benefits will be evaluated and discussed in the next section the revenue stream from goods transportation will be based on the average market price provided from a few online logistic platforms moovo 2017 porter 2017 as given in table 5 this is calculated to be usd 5 2 rs 350 if the truck travels 100 km thus the overall cost of producing 20 l of potable water using mode 3 is usd 0 18 rs 12 and the income for 1 trip is usd 5 2 rs 350 note the price of water produced by the desalination truck is only 1 of the family s daily earnings also note that current price for 20 l packaged drinking water jar is rs 20 90 in india prices are obtained from inidamart and aquamount so the potable water produced by this system could be nearly half of the lowest market price in india this indicates that the revenue from water selling is usd 7 2 rs 480 and freight transportation is usd 5 2 rs 350 per day the payback period pbp is defined as the length of time required to recover the initial investment costs by combining the ar water annual revenue of selling water and ar trans annual revenue of goods transportation a simplified payback period of the system can be calculated by eq 14 14 p b p y e a r c c u s a r w a t e r a r t r a n s u s y e a r if it is assumed that the system will operate 8 h daily and 300 days year the payback period of one truck is 2 5 years which is a reasonable payback period when compared to those of a small business therefore this mobile desalination system can promote public health through providing affordable drinking water to rural communities while concurrently improving social welfare by creating community based enterprise 6 conclusion overall this study has shown the proposed mobile ro vehicle is a technically viable and economically feasible option for rural communities with 500 4000 ppm groundwater salt concentrations deployment of low cost vehicles equipped with this simple desalination system creates a platform for the delivery of a range of goods and services in addition to local water production the experimental results indicate that a compact tubular membrane designed for a tata ace mega truck can achieve a water production rate of 16 lmh when the system works at 8 bars with a feed flow rate of 2 4 m3 hr our analysis also found that the production of 1 m3 water in this system will consume around 0 9 l of diesel fuel less than 3 of the total fuel tank capacity which costs usd 0 8 rs 53 in india and the minimum water production cost for 1 m3 water was calculated to be 4 5 us m3 assuming the water can be sold at a price of us 0 18 per 20 l including delivery service to residents combining providing a freight transportation service at price of usd 5 2 per 100 km the expected payback period would be 2 5 years additionally the practical application of the proposed mobile desalination platform could be extended to many other existing systems such as agriculture trucks if 3 of tata ace trucks 50 000 sets operating in india were fitted with this desalination system up to 40 000 m3 water would be produced per day an amount of water that can support 12 000 villages 15 million people in india thus

19395,the consumption of saline groundwater has contributed to a growing incidence of renal diseases particularly in coastal communities of india although reverse osmosis ro is routinely used to remove salt from groundwater conventional ro systems i e centralized systems using spiral wound ro elements have limited utility in these communities due to high capital and maintenances costs and lack of infrastructure to distribute the water consequently there is a need to develop an appropriate solution for groundwater treatment based on small scale mobile and community led systems in this work we designed a mobile desalination system to provide a simple platform for water treatment and delivery of goods to rural communities the system employs tubular ro membranes packed in a single low profile vessel which fits below the cargo space the low profile enables minimal intrusion on the space available for the transportation of goods pressure is delivered by a belt driven clutch pump powered by the engine water is treated locally by connecting the intake to the village well while the vehicle idles a combined numerical and experimental approach was used to optimise the module system design resulting in 20 permeate flux enhancement experimental results revealed that the system can produce 16 l per square meter of membrane area per hour lmh at a salinity level of 80 ppm from a 2000 ppm groundwater when it is feed at 1 m3 h at 8 bars this indicates that a vehicle equipped with 12 m2 of tubular ro membranes can deliver 1 m3 of drinkable water by using 0 9 l of diesel assuming eight such systems could be implemented in a community to fulfil the water demands for a village with 2000 residents a social business study revealed that a payback time of 2 5 years is achievable even if the sale price of the water is relatively low usd 0 18 rs 12 which is half of the lowest market price per 20 l including providing a goods transportation service at price of usd 5

introduction india is home to 17 5 of the world s population yet has access to only 4 of the global fresh water resources many of which are declining in both supply and quality wright and winter 2014 the water resources ministry of india reported that approximately 75 of india s drinking water is sourced from aquifers soni and pujari 2010 however 60 of these aquifers contain levels of total dissolved solids which exceed the taste threshold of 500 mg l with aquifers in the coastal regions of gujurat exceeding 1900 mg l fig 1 wright and winter 2014 in these areas particularly in coastal communities in gujarat the consumption of saline groundwater has contributed to a growing incidence in a suite of renal diseases including urolithiasis nephrolithiasis and ureterolithiasis lópez and hoppe 2010 in some areas centralized desalination plants have been installed to provide treated water however the problem with centralized solutions is that villagers accessing the treated water mostly women are still exposed to the drudgery of carrying the water back to the home chakravarty 2017 moreover as the communities most effected by saline groundwater represent the poorest quintile of agricultural workers with an average income of us 1 25 day there is limited disposable income to purchase treated water jacoby 2016 in addition the use of groundwater containing more than 2000 mg l of dissolved salts results in reduced crop yield and increased sodicity of the soil which further reduces in agricultural income nayar et al 2017 in response the indian government is committed to supply clean drinking water to all citizens nayar et al 2017 recent studies have reported that around 60 000 villages 80 million people in india do not have adequate access to clean water wright and winter 2014 in areas affected by high levels of saline groundwater it is estimated that 12 000 villages 15 million people kurup 2017 1 1 desalination technologies desalination technologies such as thermal phase change processes membrane processes or hybrids of these methods can be applied to brackish and seawater sources to produce potable water production greenlee et al 2009 in recent years reverse osmosis ro membrane technology overtook multi stage flash distillation msf as the leading desalination technology this shift can be attributed to several factors i according to many studies ro can now produce fresh water from seawater or brackish water at one half to one third of the cost of thermal processes e g distillation greenlee et al 2009 ii ro technology has the ability to remove between 95 and 99 of tds along with nearly 100 of heavy metals organic matter viruses and bacteria iii ro systems compact easy to operate maintain and have lower environmental impacts ahmad and schmid 2002 based on these same factors we have elected to investigate ro membrane technologies to develop a mobile brackish water desalination unit in this study 1 2 membrane module configurations table 1 compares brackish water ro desalination systems of varying sizes mega centralized medium small decentralized and mobile ro membrane configurations spiral wound tubular or hollow fibers and their performance most existing brackish water ro desalination systems use spiral wound elements which were originally developed for large scale centralized seawater groundwater and water recycling applications since the colloidal fouling tendency of an ro membrane is relative to the feedwater s salt density index sdi spiral wound modules used in typical ro systems require an sdi less than 5 while hollow fibre modules need a sdi of less than 3 the use of the spiral wound or hollow fibre module necessitates complex pretreatment processes in a traditional centralized plant due to the high sdi sdi 6 of seawater or saline groundwater riverol and pilipovik 2011 tubular membranes on the other hand are well suited to fluids with high viscosity and or suspended solids as their wide flow paths make them highly resistant to blocking pre treatment requirements are minimal in tubular membranes and can even be completely omitted making them more cost effective for small systems pci membranes 2017 it is worth noting that the tubular geometry can also benefit from performance boosts from hydrodynamic techniques such as secondary flows e g helix flow pentair 2017 taylor vortex flow taylor 1923 flow channel spacer inserts e g static rod yeh et al 2000 helical screw thread bellhouse et al 2001 and baffles teoh et al 2008 and two phase flow e g gas liquid flow pabby et al 2015 these techniques can enhance turbulence in the feed channel and improve the permeate flux by reducing the effect of concentration polarization and fouling li et al 2017a 1 3 desalination system due to the prevalence of chemical contamination in indian groundwater sources non governmental organizations have begun to install small 2 40 m3 day decentralized ro systems in fixed regional location wright and winter 2014 although ro is routinely used to remove salt from groundwater in small medium scale decentralized plants experience from villages in kodinar and mangrol shows that conventional ro systems have only limited utility in these communities due to a lack of local technical capacity resources and training wright and winter 2014 while some of these systems have been successfully operating for up to 5 years many have failed soon which in most cases is attributable to membrane fouling e g salt precipitation and membrane scaling after installation due to lack of proper maintenance or the inability to keep up with operational costs wright and winter 2014 greenlee et al 2009 the technical constraints are generally associated with the use of spiral wound ro elements such as pretreatment and chemical cleaning greenlee et al 2009 resource constraints are strained by the ongoing costs of power chemicals and replacement membranes additionally it is clear that in the absence of water distribution systems the usefulness of regional systems are limited by how far the users can the water for residents in remote areas with inadequate energy and water supply mobile decentralized water desalination system could solve many of the problems of fixed regional water supply facilities mobile decentralized systems can be incorporated into standard trucks or trailers and potentially provide the best solution in emergency situations however current mobile decentralized systems remain some problems all reported studies and commercialized mobile systems to date require a separate energy source to drive the system and their desalination system occupied the whole cargo space so power source unit adds significant capital cost and weight to the system limits the commercial ability of the system thus fully integrated mobile and multifunctional ro groundwater desalination platform represent a promising way forward for rural communities particularly with further technical improvement on membrane module and mobile system designs 1 4 social business model to achieve a sustainable community led systems social capital and sense of ownership can improve the effectiveness and the sustainability of community management of rural community managed water systems kelly et al 2017 hence we propose that the technology developed in this work lends itself to a so called social business model in the social business model the business runs as a non dividend organisation that is created with an objective to address and solves a social problem by applying business principles yunus et al 2010 three main features distinguish this model it endeavors to eliminate social problems and poverty it must be operated in a sustainable manner and all profits when they are made are to be reinvested into the business instead of being distributed among its shareholders social businesses model run very much like typical commercial enterprises where the target market and the market offerings products services are chosen before the business begins operations therefore to address the technical constraints a compact rectangular membrane module integrated with a mobile desalination system was developed and investigated in this paper to determine if it can provide a feasible and efficient solution meanwhile to address the social problems a social business model was developed to determine if it can provide a community based sustainable enterprise centred on goods transportation while also producing affordable drinkable water for villages 2 mobile desalination design the mobile groundwater desalination system proposed here provides a platform for the delivery of goods and services employs tubular membranes packed in a single or series parallel rectangular vessel s and can be fitted in the tray or cargo space of a vehicle the system consists of a vehicle a tata ace truck in this case study a pre screening component a membrane module a belt driven clutch pump and control accessories e g pressure regulating valve pressure relief valve as shown in fig 2 the process diagram shows the mobile system treats water extracted from a well by using a submersible pump the ro system uses mechanical energy from the vehicle s engine to drive a positive displacement pump from this pump the feed water is pressurized passed through a simple pre treatment unit e g screen and then enters the inlet distribution channel for the tubular membranes the desalinated permeate water is then collected in a reservoir while the reject stream goes back through the system upon arrival at a village or domicile the driver operator connects the pump intake to the water storage tank the product line to a drinking water receptacle and the reject concentrate line to discharge point since the mobile system was envisioned for remote agricultural areas where the feed water has tds of around 2000 ppm greenlee et al 2009 it has been designed to provide irrigation water or domestic washing water the treatment process commences by starting the engine and placing the vehicle in adjusted idle mode with optimum idle engine speed that couples the pump shaft with crank shaft at the end of the day after servicing multiple villages the membrane module is cleaned and sanitised using a solution of fresh water and citric acetic acid thus it is expected that this mobile ro membrane system is simple enough that it can easily be operated and maintained by a single person depending on the load capacity of the truck and the delivery task it might be worthwhile to let the truck carry groundwater to treat water intermittently when the truck is idling in traffic or during loading unloading of cargo due to the extra mass of water this operation mode would consume more fuel than normal deliveries but it could save fuel relative to normal deliveries plus a batch water processing mode 2 1 ro desalination module as shown in fig 3 this desalination module employs tubular ro membranes 12 5 mm in diameter supplied by pci membranes product code afc90 housed in 3 rectangular vessels designed to fit in the tray or cargo space of the vehicle the tubular membranes are arranged into modules each housing 66 pieces which can be casted in epoxy resin at each end multiple modules are connected with 3 in series and 4 in parallel giving 12 modules in the system and a total membrane area of 11 5 m2 the modules are operated in a cross flow configuration in that the feed water goes through the inside of the membrane tube with the permeate flow directed perpendicularly out of the membranes into an acrylic vessel the packing density and arrangement of the tubular membranes has been optimized to reduce the vertical profile of the rectangular vessel 0 165 m tall as shown in fig 4 to minimize the impact on the storage capacity of the vehicle to reduce the concentration polarization coefficient the length of each unit 0 432 m as shown in fig 4 was optimized by numerical analysis as shown in fig 4 b since the tubular membrane has a large diameter 12 5 mm in internal diameter and 13 5 mm in outer diameter it can reduce the requirement for pretreatment and is able to process feed waters with larger particles without blocking and irreversible fouling yeh et al 2011 high cross flow velocity can reduce the salt concentration polarization effect on the membrane surface mänttäri et al 2010 but also increase power consumption per litre of feed water therefore optimisation is required to determine the ideal balance between the installed module surface area and the velocities used the nominal maximum operating pressure of this module is designed to be 15 bars for treating brackish groundwater with 1000 4000 ppm salinity level the lower operating pressure reduces stress on the membranes and other parts of the module this allows light weight materials e g fibre reinforced plastics to be used in this module while maintaining structural integrity also light weight plastic pipes e g polyethylene and quick connect fittings e g polypropylene can be used to minimize the weight and cost of this system the details of the numerical and experimental analysis of this design are reported in the following sections 2 2 integrated truck and desalination module the tata ace mega was selected for this case study which is a 1030 kg cargo carrier from tata motors and has maximum engine output of 30 kw at 3750 rpm capable of a top speed of 80 km h a 30 l fuel tank is installed with a typical fuel economy of 21 km l giving an approximate range of 540 km per tank for an empty vehicle the dimensions of the membrane configuration are constrained by the bed of the tata ace 2140 mm length x 1430 mm width x 300 mm height which is the proposed location for the membrane unit to take off the power from tata ace mega for groundwater desalination a belt driven clutch pump can be installed on the engine by using mounting kits and driven via two belts from an add on crankshaft pulley the pump speed and discharge pressure are determined by revolutions per minute rmp of the engine under an added idle for water desalination mode by equipping with an automatic pressure regulating valve this device ensures a constant working pressure at 8 10 bars note that a piston pump would be more suitable for this application as it can work with water and other thin liquids including liquids containing abrasives however this system adds approximately 100 kg to the vehicle weight including a belt driven clutch pump 10 kg the membrane module 80 kg the associated pipework 5 kg and the remaining water in the module 5 kg this will decrease the fuel efficiency for the transportation of goods and have an associated effect on the range of the vehicle it has been noted that a 10 increase in gross vehicle weight corresponding to 100 kg for the tata ace mega results in a fuel efficiency decrease of 5 oh and park 2014 the truck will be able to access local sources of saline groundwater and deliver the treated water in 20 l bottles directly to clustered residences water sales would only be a small part of the revenue stream of course with the balance derived from commercial activities the delivery of a range of goods and services 3 numerical and experimentation methodology the performance of this ro desalination module was simulated by computational fluid dynamics cfd the computational model was developed using ansys fluent version 16 2 the permeate flux j and salt concentration profile c salt for varying operating pressures and feed velocities were obtained via a 3d cfd modelling domain which due to symmetry includes quarters of two diagonally adjacent tubular membranes the transmembrane flux was implemented into the simulation domain by our previous mass jump method to predict the performance of the tubular membrane lian et al 2016 this method enables evaluation of the effects of operating pressure salt concentration and crossflow velocity for both total flux and local flux along the membrane s length at steady state and under laminar flow the transport equations for the feed permeate of the membrane can be described by the following the continuity equation is given by 1 ρ v s m the momentum transport equation is expressed by 2 ρ v v p τ ρ g s v where s m and s v are 2 source terms representing the quantitative changes of mass and momentum on each side of membrane surface respectively these source terms can be written as 3 s m j a v a t r r o j a v a t r r i 4 s v j a v v a t r r o j a v v a t r r i where a v r o r i and v are the membrane area flow velocity inner radius and outer radius the volume of the element respectively j is the transmembrane mass flux calculated from the membrane permeability and transmembrane pressure 5 j k m p f p p π where k m represents the pure water permeability of the membrane with an average value of 0 0000263 kg m 2 h 1 pa 1 as was determined from the experiment section by circulating deionized di water as feed solution at pressure from 2 to 8 bars as shown in fig 9 a p f p p and π are the feed permeate and osmosis pressure the osmotic pressure can be expressed as 6 π i c r t where i is the dimensionless van t hoff index 1 8 for sodium chloride c is the salt concentration mol l 1 at the membrane surface for the calculated simulation cell r is the ideal gas constant 0 0821 l atm mol 1 k 1 and t is the temperature in kelvin 298 k 3 1 numerical simulation for these simulations a 1 2 m long multiple fibre bundle was investigated as shown in fig 5 a sweep method was used to achieve a unified mesh size 10 3 m along the axial direction of the membrane in the transverse direction a finer mesh is required at the liquid membrane interfaces for both the lumen and the shell side thus an inflation of the first layer s thickness of 2 10 5 m was selected to ensure higher resolution in zones where the concentration polarization and transport phenomena occur the variables simulated include inlet velocities pressures and feed salt concentrations summarized in table 2 different fiber lengths were set up to investigate modules in series e g 3 modules in series each with 0 4 m length for a total module length of 1 2 m for simulating modules in series the feed outlet condition including pressure salt concentration and flow rate was applied as the inlet feed condition for the next module 3 2 experimental setup as shown in fig 6 a the experimental rig consists of a full scale module with dimensions of 0 43 0 22 0 165 m length width height a circulating fluid loop a pump several pressure and flow sensors and a data acquisition system daq the feed tank as shown in fig 6 was filled with 20 l of a 1000 2000 3000 4000 ppm nacl solution and the feed conductivity was measured the pump was turned on to increase the feed flow to 1 5 10 l min with all permeate returning to the feed tank to ensure constant feed composition the pump speed and gate valve were adjusted until the retentate pressure reached from 2 to 10 bar in 2 bar increments to ensure stable salt concentrations in both lines samples were collected from both and the conductivity of each sample was measured and recorded along with the time using a portable conductivity meter this same process was carried out for the different feed salt concentrations e g 1000 2000 3000 and 4000 ppm nacl solutions each covering 2 4 6 8 and 10 bar pressure increments the experiment process and measurement readings were controlled and recorded by a supervisory control and data acquisition scada platform the change in salt concentration in both the feed c feed and the permeate c perm was determined using the correlation for the conductivity measurements using the calculated salt concentration values the salt rejection can then be found using eq 7 7 r 1 c p e r m c f e e d 4 results and discussion permeate flux distribution along the tubular membranes was simulated to optimise the length of tubular membranes for module design as shown in fig 7 the flux decreases along the axial location of tubular membranes due to increased osmotic pressure created by salt concentration polarization thus a module design with the shorter tubular membrane or multi stage can significantly reduce this negative effect the membrane length of each multi stage can be calculated by total length of the module 1 2 m was constrained by the size of truck bed divided by the number of stages n in the axial direction z axis by using the data from fig 7 derived from cfd the q p e r m m u l t i s t a g e and q p e r m s i n g l e s t a g e are the permeate flow rate l hour for the tubular membrane respectively were calculated as following eqs 8 and 9 8 q p e r m m u l t i s t a g e i 1 n 0 1 2 n j p e r m z π d m dz 9 q p e r m s i n g l e s t a g e 0 1 2 j p e r m z π d m dz the enhancement of permeate flow rate l hour by employing multi stages membrane can be obtained from the difference of the q p e r m m u l t i s t a g e and q p e r m s i n g l e s t a g e for instance average permeate flow rate can be enhanced from 0 63 l hour using a 1 2 m tubular membrane single stage to 0 71 l hour using 0 4 m long membrane 3 stages as shown in fig 7 b this is because the feed solution can be mixed in the manifold between each stage unit however increasing the number of stages in the axial direction will increase the weight and cost of the module as more manifolds or membrane housing are required resulting in a techno economic design trade off therefore a 3 stage module design 0 4 m long membrane was determined for this module design resulting in 12 permeate flux enhancement compared to 1 stage module 1 2 m long membrane further increase in module stage number will have negligible improvement on permeate flux but will result in a significant increase in weight of module the permeate flux of the optimized module can be simulated by selecting various feed flowrates between 2 5 and 100 l min within a range of feed pressures 2 20 bars as shown in fig 8 it can be seen that increasing feed flow rate has a more significant effect on permeate flux at higher operating pressure due to its ability to decrease concentration polarization this indicates that when this module is operated at or above 10 bars flow rates above 10 l min per module or 40 l min per system noting that each system has 4 modules in parallel are recommended thus 20 improvement in water production can be achieved by this optimized module design and operating parameter the permeate mass flux of the module was determined by the experiment for different operating pressures and feed salt concentrations summarized in fig 9 the results indicate that the permeate flux again mainly depends on the operating pressure and 8 16 lmh can be achieved from this module for treating groundwater with salinity levels of 1000 4000 ppm notably the feed velocity has only a slight linear effect on the permeate flux according to the experimental results this can be explained by the linear increase in the reynolds number in the tubular membranes from 50 to 150 when increasing the feed velocity from 1 5 to 7 l min higher reynolds numbers reduce concentration polarization but increasing the flow velocity will consume more pumping power the experimental results show good agreement with the cfd results as shown in fig 10 there are greater discrepancies between the experimental and cfd results for 4 bars and 6 bars the possible reason is using the average the membrane permeability 2 65 10 5 kg m 2 h 1 pa 1 for the cfd analysis at different pressure derived from fig 9 a the average permeability used in the cfd is close to actual tested membrane permeability at 2 bars and 8 bars 2 7 10 5 kg m 2 h 1 pa 1 but it is slightly higher than the actual tested membrane permeability at 4 bars and 6 bars 2 5 10 5 kg m 2 h 1 pa 1 the flow meter was further calibrated by using the bucket and stopwatch method the results give an average uncertainty of about 5 in the mass flow range of 1 10 l min the salt rejection of the module was tested by measuring the salt levels of the permeate and using eq 7 the test on permeate water quality salinity level during the experiment revealed that a salt rejection rate of 96 can be achieved by this module across all concentrations as shown in fig 11 which is less than the salt rejection 99 stated by the manufacturer this is because the type of membrane used in the module was designed to withstand pressures up to 60 bars salt rejection and pressure have a positive relationship so if higher pressures were used i e a pressure much greater than 15 bars the salt rejection would also increase and could potentially reach 99 nevertheless excellent quality of water can be obtained from this ro module the salt removal by the module is more than enough to achieve a permeate with less than 500 ppm in tds concentration indian drinking water standards requirement for potable water for all tested feed concentrations in this section numerical and initial experimental studies are conducted to optimise the mobile desalination system while the proposed technology can provide safe drinking water organizations may still face challenges in making them financially sustainable thus to investigate the viability of the mobile system a social business study of this mobile desalination system was reported in the next section 5 social and economic analysis the lean canvas approach rosário cabrita et al 2016 is used to develop a preliminary social business model to increase the chance of the mobile desalination system to be successfully implanted into the rural communities of gujarat the social business model will be based on implementing the mobile desalination trucks in one village in junagadh with a population of 2000 people note that more than 50 of villages in junagadh have population of 1000 to 2000 assuming that each resident demands 3 l day of drinking water wright and winter 2014 the village demands 6000 l day the lean canvas method of developing a business model considers the problem customer solution unique value proposition revenue and cost streams and key metrics of the business each aspect of the lean canvas is addressed below to address the problems as described in the introduction section providing a mobile desalination truck will allow villagers to produce drinking water directly from wells and assists in transporting crops goods by creating delivery services while desalinating water at various villages buyers will contact owners of the truck via short message service sms or online logistic platforms and will submit an order for good transportation or service to desalinate water in their village this multipurpose equipment can create better connectivity between villages for greater access to clean water and more efficient distribution of crops goods the target customers and users are rural communities located far away from centralized desalination systems and only have access to surface water or groundwater the tata trust could be a customer especially now that they have established their tata water mission to bring water initiatives to 12 000 villages in the next three years the early adopters of the mobile desalination truck would most likely be farmers who need to transport their crops to market and also need access to clean water which can be produced by the truck the social and economic impact of the desalination truck will be the key metrics to reflect the contribution of the innovation to rural communities the social impact will be measured as a percentage of residents with daily access to safe and contamination free drinking water also since water can be provided near habitats or can be received at home the eliminated load of carrying back water from the source to home can be regarded as another social benefit chakravarty 2017 the economic impact will be measured based on the transactions made between desalination truck owners and customers drinking water consumers on demand booking platform for mini trucks 5 1 system cost analysis the capital expenditure required for the mobile desalination truck produced from a range of suppliers alibaba 2017 pci membranes 2017 originwater 2017 tata 2017 as shown in table 3 the capital expenditure for one mobile desalination truck is usd 7900 or rs 527 000 note the conversion is 1 rs 0 015 usd it is important to take into consideration that the expected lifetime of the system is estimated to be 10 years while that of the membranes of the ro unit have a life of only 5 years this means that the ro membranes will be replaced after years 5 10 and the membrane replacement cost will be considered in the following economic analysis as each truck has 12 m2 of membrane area the truck is able to produce 192 l hr based on the experimental results discussed in section 3 3 the results in table 4 show that the system can be more cost effective if the operation hours increase this is due to fewer trucks 8 trucks will be required to produce 6000 l day resulting in lower capital expenditure however the drawback of operating for 4 h per session is that the truck will not be able to take as many orders from the freight logistic platform during the rest of 4 h the average number of orders and travel distance are assumed as shown in table 5 based on the data provided by indian s logistics industry operated by online platforms thus the total investments including the capital investment fuel consumption and maintenance cost are outlined in table 4 the hydraulic power required for the operating conditions 8 bars 40 l min is calculated to be 0 5 kw based on eq 10 10 p h k w q f h ρ g 3 670 10 6 where the feed flow rate q f was set at 2 4 m3 hr 40 l min and the required head h is 80 m based on a feed pressure of 8 bar the motor power fuel consumption rate may be calculated as the hydraulic power divided by the pump efficiency assumed to be 70 and motor efficiency assumed to be 40 11 p m k w p h η p η m thus the fuel consumption rate of the desalination system would be 1 8 kw indicating 9 4 kwh of the fuel energy is required to produce 1 m3 of drinking water the other main cost of operating the desalination truck is due to transporting goods via an intra city freight logistics platform e g moovo porter the fuel consumption costs for good transportation depend on the travel distance the loads and the fuel efficiency of the truck the travel distance for each operation mode was assumed in table 4 and the fuel efficiency of 21 km l with a payload capacity of 1030 kg was claimed by tata motors thus if mode 3 is used the distance traveled during one day is 100 km which uses 4 7 l of diesel fuel based on the truck s fuel efficiency 5 2 revenue stream and discussion sources of revenue for the owner of the truck will be from selling the produced clean water and services of transporting goods the price of the water sold is made to cover the cost of water production and delivery as well as the revenue difference between producing water and providing freight transportation service a detailed levelized cost of water lcow formula was applied in this system analysis as given by eq 12 and 13 which takes into account the capital cost of the entire system cc operating and maintenance costs omc and the fuel cost fc li et al 2017b the cost of desalinating 1 m3 of brackish water using this system can be calculated as follows 12 l c o w u s d m 3 c c c r f o m c f c u s d q m 3 where crf is the capital recovery factor defined in eq 13 13 c r f i 1 i n 1 i n 1 where i represents interest rate with a value of 6 and the number of periods 10 years used in the calculations will be equal to the useful life of a utility truck which best represents the mobile desalination truck thus the lcow of water is usd 4 5 m3 usd 0 09 per 20 l compared to centralized ro plants even the lcow of water for the mobile desalination truck is very high however the revenue of the system are not just water treatment as outlined in table 5 the other revenue streams and social benefits will be evaluated and discussed in the next section the revenue stream from goods transportation will be based on the average market price provided from a few online logistic platforms moovo 2017 porter 2017 as given in table 5 this is calculated to be usd 5 2 rs 350 if the truck travels 100 km thus the overall cost of producing 20 l of potable water using mode 3 is usd 0 18 rs 12 and the income for 1 trip is usd 5 2 rs 350 note the price of water produced by the desalination truck is only 1 of the family s daily earnings also note that current price for 20 l packaged drinking water jar is rs 20 90 in india prices are obtained from inidamart and aquamount so the potable water produced by this system could be nearly half of the lowest market price in india this indicates that the revenue from water selling is usd 7 2 rs 480 and freight transportation is usd 5 2 rs 350 per day the payback period pbp is defined as the length of time required to recover the initial investment costs by combining the ar water annual revenue of selling water and ar trans annual revenue of goods transportation a simplified payback period of the system can be calculated by eq 14 14 p b p y e a r c c u s a r w a t e r a r t r a n s u s y e a r if it is assumed that the system will operate 8 h daily and 300 days year the payback period of one truck is 2 5 years which is a reasonable payback period when compared to those of a small business therefore this mobile desalination system can promote public health through providing affordable drinking water to rural communities while concurrently improving social welfare by creating community based enterprise 6 conclusion overall this study has shown the proposed mobile ro vehicle is a technically viable and economically feasible option for rural communities with 500 4000 ppm groundwater salt concentrations deployment of low cost vehicles equipped with this simple desalination system creates a platform for the delivery of a range of goods and services in addition to local water production the experimental results indicate that a compact tubular membrane designed for a tata ace mega truck can achieve a water production rate of 16 lmh when the system works at 8 bars with a feed flow rate of 2 4 m3 hr our analysis also found that the production of 1 m3 water in this system will consume around 0 9 l of diesel fuel less than 3 of the total fuel tank capacity which costs usd 0 8 rs 53 in india and the minimum water production cost for 1 m3 water was calculated to be 4 5 us m3 assuming the water can be sold at a price of us 0 18 per 20 l including delivery service to residents combining providing a freight transportation service at price of usd 5 2 per 100 km the expected payback period would be 2 5 years additionally the practical application of the proposed mobile desalination platform could be extended to many other existing systems such as agriculture trucks if 3 of tata ace trucks 50 000 sets operating in india were fitted with this desalination system up to 40 000 m3 water would be produced per day an amount of water that can support 12 000 villages 15 million people in india thus the proposed system will be very suitable for rural communities in india or other countries further optimisation this technology e g optimum number of membranes in each module structure of the module system is needed to improve the obtainable flux and operational reliability of this system a turbulence inducing manifold design can be implemented i e made by 3d printer to reduce the complexity of the manifolds and to ensure uniform water flow distribution in the tubular membranes the long term use should also be investigated with further experiments on this equipment to improve the reliability

were prepared by diluting stock solutions to maintain a total organic carbon toc level of 3 mg l shale gas production wastewater used in this study was synthesized according to water quality parameters obtained from warner et al 2013 s study as shown in table 1 debrominated production wastewater was obtained by ozonating production wastewater using a triogen lab 2b ozone generator at room temperature 21 c and purging the ozonated solution with air to strip off bromine individual metal ion stock solutions were prepared with ca2 mg2 and ba2 in forms of nitrate salts at the same concentrations as they appeared in production wastewater individual anion solutions cl no3 and so4 2 were made by dissolving their sodium salts into distilled water at the same mole concentration as calcium 241 mm 2 3 sample chlorination prior to chlorination four natural water samples as described above in 250 ml borosilicate amber glass bottles were buffered at ph 8 with 2 ml l borate buffer 1 0 m boric acid and 0 26 m sodium hydroxide ph 8 zhao et al 2016 production wastewater and debrominated production wastewater were added into these water samples with a spiking percentage of 0 0 005 0 01 0 05 or 0 1 by volume similar to that reported by rossi et al 2011 each sample was chlorinated at a free chlorine dose of 12 mg l by applying a hypochlorite stock solution the stock solution was standardized by dpd colorimetric method with a hach dr 890 colorimeter loveland co usa each time before use baird et al 2017 chlorinated samples were then incubated in absence of light at room temperature 21 c after 24 h water samples were measured for both ph and free chlorine residual excess particulate sodium sulfite was applied as a chlorine quenching agent for chloral hydrate analyses while granular ammonium chloride for all other dbps as suggested by epa methods 551 1 and 552 3 samples were extracted immediately after dechlorination as described below 2 4 analytical methods dbp species analyzed in this study include four thms chloroform bromodichloromethane bdcm chlorodibromomethane cdbm and bromoform seven haas dichloroacetic acid dcaa bromochloroacetic acid bcaa dibromoacetic acid dbaa trichloroacetic acid tcaa bromodichloroacetic acid bdcaa chlorodibromoacetic acid cdbaa and tribromoacetic acid tbaa chloral hydrate and dichloroacetonitrile dcan haas were extracted following modified epa method 552 3 xie et al 2002 while all other dbps were analyzed based on modified epa method 551 1 for haa analyses each 30 ml water sample was pre acidified with 1 5 ml of concentrated sulfuric acid and then extracted with 3 ml of mtbe spiked with 300 μg l of 1 2 dibromopropane as internal standard is 10 g of sodium sulfate anhydrous was added to enhance

without acidification and methylation steps and analyzed with an agilent 6890n gc santa clara ca usa equipped with an ecd haas were separated by nitrogen carrier gas on an agilent db 1701 capillary column 30 m 0 25 mm 0 25 μm while an agilent db 1 capillary column 30 m 0 32 mm 1 μm was used for other dbps 3 results and discussion production wastewater was synthesized based on water quality parameters obtained from warner et al 2013 s study as shown in table 1 due to low impact on dbp formation found by other study parker et al 2014 organic components were excluded for better experimental control this was because based on a highest value of 177 mg l toc in production wastewater tested in parker et al 2014 s study the organics would be so much diluted by freshwater in realistic in stream scenarios and would be hardly differentiated from the background toc level although the concentrations of non precursor inorganic ions vary from shale to shale the diversity of major species does not change significantly thus one synthetic wastewater sample was used in this study 3 1 effects of production wastewater on dbp formation during chlorination of surface and waste waters production wastewater was spiked into four field water samples at volume percentages of 0 0 005 0 01 0 05 and 0 1 to simulate their dilutions after discharge in receiving waters before chlorination the swatara creek water results thms and haas were illustrated in fig 1 while others were not included due to similarities similar with the results reported by other studies rossi et al 2011 parker et al 2014 brominated species increased at the expenses of their chlorinated analogues due to the presence of bromide the formation of completely brominated species e g bromoform and dbaa increased as more production wastewater was added while the partially brominated species e g bdcm and bcaa increased to a certain degree and then decreased for the creek water river water reservoir water and treated wastewater samples overall thm increased by 94 131 similar trends were observed on haas which were divided into dihaloacetic acids dhaas and trihaloacetic acids thaas due to their distinctive precursors and formation pathways xie 2001 overall dhaas and thaas increased by 12 44 and 0 46 respectively however because all the chlorinated species were regulated by epa into haa5 monochloroacetic acid monobromoacetic acid dcaa dbaa and tcaa the total amount of haa5 decreased when production wastewater was added all these results were found in line with previous studies rossi et al 2011 parker et al 2014 rossi et al 2011 which also indicated this synthetic wastewater was a valid representation to field production wastewater 3 2 effects of debrominated production wastewater on dbp formation during chlorination of surface and waste waters debrominated production wastewater through ozonation and air purging was spiked into four water samples at the same volume percentages the ozone aeration process was effective in removing the majority of bromide from production wastewater and would be of great significance for practical applications additionally the debromination process was also necessary to remove the naturally occurring bromide as high as 0 01 in the nacl chemical that was used to make the synthetic production wastewater after such debromination treatment the bromide residuals were low which led to decreased formation of brominated dbps below 5 μg l and some chlorinated dbps after chlorination for example the chloroform in three natural waters decreased by 6 10 while its proportion in thm dropped from 91 94 to 88 92 as spiking percentage increased chloroform decreased 4 in treated wastewater fig 2 a however some chlorinated dbps were found increased as spiking percentage increased when the creek water reservoir water and treated wastewater contained 0 1 of debrominated production wastewater the formation of tcaa increased by 10 17 fig 2c while dcan increased by 20 29 in all four waters fig 2d these increases could have been more significant if no bromide residual existed this indicated the existence of considerable synergistic effects of non bromide species on dbp formation at 0 1 of debrominated production wastewater the total molar concentration of metal ions na ca2 mg2 ba2 and sr2 have achieved 1 54 mm which could potentially interact with organic precursors to catalyze dbp formation as reported in some other studies navalon et al 2009 liu et al 2012 gan et al 2016 zhao et al 2016 neither notable increase nor decrease was found on dcaa formation in four waters fig 2b 3 3 effects of debrominated production wastewater on dbp formation during chlorination of synthetic citric acid and humic acid solutions field waters containing unidentified organics and ions could introduce uncertainties to the promotional effects of debrominated production wastewater on dbp yields during water chlorination to reduce these potential interferences humic acid was selected as an individual natural organic matter while citric acid as a surrogate with small molecular weight clear structure and functional groups to study the mechanisms navalon et al 2009 zhao et al 2016 both solutions were prepared with a toc at 3 mg l when the spiking percentage of debrominated production wastewater was as low as 0 005 metal ion concentration was 0 08 mm chloroform dcaa and chloral hydrate increased by 400 510 and 520 respectively compared with no wastewater addition when using citric acid as organic precursor fig 3 a this might be due to the complexation between organic precursors and metal ions which enhanced the dbp formation during chlorination navalon et al 2009 liu et al 2012 hu et al 2016 zhao et al 2016 tcaa and dcan were hardly detected generally below 3 μg l during the whole process which indicated citric acid was not a precursor for tcaa and dcan zhao et al 2016 for humic acid solution the increases of chloroform dcan and chloral hydrate formation at 0 005 spiking percentage only reached 7 9 and 10 and no significant impacts were found on either dcaa or tcaa fig 3b the difference of functional groups on humic acid and on citric acid may result in the different levels of enhancement for example studies indicated that carboxylate groups might be the main places where complexation occurred that increased the reactivity towards chlorination navalon et al 2009 while citric acid contains much higher portion of carboxylate groups than humic acid does according to their molecular structures in addition as spiking percentages of debrominated production wastewater increased the formation of chloroform dcaa and chloral hydrate in citric acid group increased by 920 830 and even 3600 respectively at 0 03 spiking ratio metal ion concentration was 0 46 mm and then chloroform and dcaa decreased due to elevated bromide residuals fig 3a chloral hydrate has been regulated at 10 μg l as chloral in china and 20 μg l in australia wang et al 2015 which are much lower than thms and haas for humic acid solution the increase of chloroform reached the highest of 13 when spiking percentage was 0 03 followed by a slight decrease while dcaa and tcaa reached 6 and 16 respectively at 0 1 spiking percentage dcan and chloral hydrate had their highest increases of 41 and 35 when 0 05 of debrominated production wastewater was added fig 3b there were little effects on tcaa in citric acid solution and dcaa in humic acid solution it is important to note that some critical species did not show significant increase because their yields were under the negative influence of bromide residuals 3 4 effects of individual cations and anions on dbp formation during chlorination of citric acid solution to better understand the mechanisms of metal ions enhancing dbp formation these metal ions were discussed individually following the same process individual ca2 mg2 and ba2 aqueous solutions were prepared by dissolving their nitrate salts into distilled water at the same concentrations as they were found in production wastewater citric acid was again used as the organic precursor after chlorination chloral hydrate dcan and brominated species were all found below 1 μg l when citric acid solution contained as low as 0 005 of calcium solution ca2 0 01 mm the concentrations of chloroform and dcaa increased by 340 and 270 while 135 and 130 for magnesium solution mg2 0 002 mm and 25 and 15 for barium solution ba2 0 001 mm respectively fig 4 as the spiking percentage increased the synergistic effect of magnesium eventually exceeded that of calcium at the highest volume percentage 0 1 of metal ion solutions the formation of chloroform and dcaa increased by 10 and 7 times for calcium solution while 18 and 10 times for magnesium solution even though magnesium concentration was five times lower than that of calcium this might be caused by the higher competence of mg citrate chelates in facilitating dbp yields compared to ca citrate since evidence indicated that magnesium and calcium had similar binding capacities with citric acid smith and martell 1989 at this spiking percentage barium also achieved its largest enhancement on the yields of chloroform and dcaa at 79 and 84 respectively under the impact of 0 1 of mg2 ca2 and ba2 the chloroform concentrations were 229 132 and 21 μg l while dcaa were 121 86 and 20 μg l respectively fig 4 it was concluded that at low spiking percentages of production wastewater 0 05 calcium played the main role of enhancing dbp formation due to its greatest concentration however as spiking percentage increased the largest contributor became magnesium due to the higher competence of its chelates in enhancing dbp formation even though its molarity was still five times lower than that of calcium studies suggested that the complexations of these metal ions with citric acid occurred at a 1 1 m ratio to form negatively charged complexes joseph 1946 to study these mechanisms the material relations in complexation process were presented in eqs 1 4 while the related dbp formation is shown in eq 5 plaza et al 2006 zhao and xie 2016 1 m l m l 2 k m l m l 3 m m l m t o t a l 4 l m l l t o t a l 5 f p l f p l m l f p m l where m denotes free metal ions l is free organic precursor citric acid ml is the complex of metal ions and organic precursor m citrate k is stability constant means the concentration of each substance mtotal and ltotal are the concentrations of total metal ions and organic precursors fp is dbp formation potential fpl is dbp formation potential by free organic precursor fpml is dbp formation potential by the complex the relation between ml and mtotal is shown in eq 6 where ltotal was fixed at 0 042 mm the chelate stability constants k of calcium magnesium and barium with citric acid were obtained from a published source at 2 818 mmol 1 2 818 mmol 1 and 0 537 mmol 1 respectively smith and martell 1989 the plot of eq 6 for three metals was illustrated in fig 5 by combining eqs 1 6 into eq 7 and fitting it to experimental data points we were able to calculate the dbp formation potentials by free organic precursor fpl and chelate fpml the results were illustrated in fig 6 6 m l 1 2 m t o t a l l t o t a l 1 k 1 2 m t o t a l l t o t a l 1 k 2 m t o t a l l t o

fpl and fpml were calculated for different metal ions and dbp species before tabulated into table 2 it showed that the fpml was orders of magnitude higher than fpl and the magnesium complex resulted in much higher fpml than calcium s and barium s complexes did free citric acid generated slightly more chloroform than dcaa while the chelates enlarged this difference significantly all these indicated that metal ions could greatly impact dbp formation and speciation through the formation of chelates although this mechanism exploration only involved citric acid the enhancement of non bromide ions on dbp formation when using humic acid may operate in a similar way more research is under way for the mechanism study in shale gas production industry elevated so4 2 was found in treated effluent since it was usually applied excessively by treatment facilities for ba2 removal prior to discharge warner et al 2013 the effects of it as well as other original anion cl on dbp formation were investigated in this research no3 was studied as control due to its incorporation into cations tested above three anions in their sodium salts were dissolved to the same mole concentration as calcium 241 mm and then added into citric acid solution at different spiking percentages followed by chlorination chloroform and dcaa were two main species analyzed this time since both tcaa and chloral hydrate were observed below 2 μg l compared to cl and no3 so4 2 played a more significant role on dbp formation the addition of so4 2 at 0 5 spiking percentage increased the formations of chloroform and dcaa by 37 and 44 respectively this indicates that the discharge of treated production wastewater containing elevated sulfate may increase the sulfate level in receiving waters and enhance dbp formation in downstream water treatment plant in addition to sulfate sulfite has been found involved in the formation of some new dbps while being used as a dechlorination agent which provide sulfo group for the byproducts gong and zhang 2015 although sulfite concentration in produced water is at trace levels further research could involve the impacts of trace anions on dbp formation 4 conclusion in summary this study investigated the effects of bromide and non bromide ions in shale gas production wastewater on dbp formation by simulating its spills and discharge into surface waters we compared complexation with dbp derivation to investigate the mechanisms of metal ions enhancing dbp formation individual organic precursors were adopted to simplify this process bromide in production wastewater largely enhanced the formation of brominated dbps at the expenses of their chlorinated analogues debrominated production wastewater considerably increased formations of some chlorinated dbps such as tcaa and dcan in selected field water samples which was mainly caused by the catalytic effects of metal organic chelates this effect followed the sequence of magnesium calcium barium when citric acid was used as the precursor enhanced dbp formation was also observed in elevated sulfate solution compared with other anions overall our results provided the evidence that both bromide and non bromide ions presented in production wastewater could enhance dbp formation the specific halide removal process may not be adequate to eliminate deleterious effects of production wastewater further studies should focus on salinity removal technologies such as reverse osmosis nanofiltration electrodialysis ion exchange and lime soda ash softening acknowledgements

the swatara creek susquehanna river middletown reservoir and a domestic wastewater treatment plant in middletown pennsylvania samples were transferred to laboratory within 30 min and then filtered through 0 45 μm nominal pore size membrane filters all the samples were processed in 2 h after collection surrogate stock solutions were prepared by dissolving citric acid and humic acid anhydrous sodium salts into distilled water and then filtered by 0 45 μm membrane filters the stock solutions were stored in a refrigerator 4 c until use for a maximum of 15 days working surrogate solutions were prepared by diluting stock solutions to maintain a total organic carbon toc level of 3 mg l shale gas production wastewater used in this study was synthesized according to water quality parameters obtained from warner et al 2013 s study as shown in table 1 debrominated production wastewater was obtained by ozonating production wastewater using a triogen lab 2b ozone generator at room temperature 21 c and purging the ozonated solution with air to strip off bromine individual metal ion stock solutions were prepared with ca2 mg2 and ba2 in forms of nitrate salts at the same concentrations as they appeared in production wastewater individual anion solutions cl no3 and so4 2 were made by dissolving their sodium salts into distilled water at the same mole concentration as calcium 241 mm 2 3 sample chlorination prior to chlorination four natural water samples as described above in 250 ml borosilicate amber glass bottles were buffered at ph 8 with 2 ml l borate buffer 1 0 m boric acid and 0 26 m sodium hydroxide ph 8 zhao et al 2016 production wastewater and debrominated production wastewater were added into these water samples with a spiking percentage of 0 0 005 0 01 0 05 or 0 1 by volume similar to that reported by rossi et al 2011 each sample was chlorinated at a free chlorine dose of 12 mg l by applying a hypochlorite stock solution the stock solution was standardized by dpd colorimetric method with a hach dr 890 colorimeter loveland co usa each time before use baird et al 2017 chlorinated samples were then incubated in absence of light at room temperature 21 c after 24 h water samples were measured for both ph and free chlorine residual excess particulate sodium sulfite was applied as a chlorine quenching agent for chloral hydrate analyses while granular ammonium chloride for all other dbps as suggested by epa methods 551 1 and 552 3 samples were extracted immediately after dechlorination as described below 2 4 analytical methods dbp species analyzed in this study include four thms chloroform bromodichloromethane bdcm chlorodibromomethane cdbm and bromoform seven haas dichloroacetic acid dcaa bromochloroacetic acid bcaa dibromoacetic acid dbaa trichloroacetic acid tcaa bromodichloroacetic acid bdcaa chlorodibromoacetic acid cdbaa and tribromoacetic acid tbaa chloral hydrate and dichloroacetonitrile dcan haas were extracted following modified epa method 552 3 xie et al 2002 while all other dbps were analyzed based on modified epa method 551 1 for haa analyses each 30 ml water sample was pre acidified with 1 5 ml of concentrated sulfuric acid and then extracted with 3 ml of mtbe spiked with 300 μg l of 1 2 dibromopropane as internal standard is 10 g of sodium sulfate anhydrous was added to enhance extraction efficiency after 3 min shaking and 5 min layer separation 1 ml of upper layer solvent was transferred into a test tube together with approximate 1 ml of freshly prepared 10 sulfuric acid methanol solution samples were placed into 50 c water bath for exactly 2 h for methylation then samples were back extracted with 10 sodium sulfate to remove excess methanol the upper mtbe extracts were transferred into sample vials and analyzed with an hp 6890 gas chromatograph gc palo alto ca usa equipped with an electron capture detector ecd other dbps were extracted in the same manner without acidification and methylation steps and analyzed with an agilent 6890n gc santa clara ca usa equipped with an ecd haas were separated by nitrogen carrier gas on an agilent db 1701 capillary column 30 m 0 25 mm 0 25 μm while an agilent db 1 capillary column 30 m 0 32 mm 1 μm was used for other dbps 3 results and discussion production wastewater was synthesized based on water quality parameters obtained from warner et al 2013 s study as shown in table 1 due to low impact on dbp formation found by other study parker et al 2014 organic components were excluded for better experimental control this was because based on a highest value of 177 mg l toc in production wastewater tested in parker et al 2014 s study the organics would be so much diluted by freshwater in realistic in stream scenarios and would be hardly differentiated from the background toc level although the concentrations of non precursor inorganic ions vary from shale to shale the diversity of major species does not change significantly thus one synthetic wastewater sample was used in this study 3 1 effects of production wastewater on dbp formation during chlorination of surface and waste waters production wastewater was spiked into four field water samples at volume percentages of 0 0 005 0 01 0 05 and 0 1 to simulate their dilutions after discharge in receiving waters before chlorination the swatara creek water results thms and haas were illustrated in fig 1 while others were not included due to similarities similar with the results reported by other studies rossi et al 2011 parker et al 2014 brominated species increased at the expenses of their chlorinated analogues due to the presence of bromide the formation of completely brominated species e g bromoform and dbaa increased as more production wastewater was added while the partially brominated species e g bdcm and bcaa increased to a certain degree and then decreased for the creek water river water reservoir water and treated wastewater samples overall thm increased by 94 131 similar trends were observed on haas which were divided into dihaloacetic acids dhaas and trihaloacetic acids thaas due to their distinctive precursors and formation pathways xie 2001 overall dhaas and thaas increased by 12 44 and 0 46 respectively however because all the chlorinated species were regulated by epa into haa5 monochloroacetic acid monobromoacetic acid dcaa dbaa and tcaa the total amount of haa5 decreased when production wastewater was added all these results were found in line with previous studies rossi et al 2011 parker et al 2014 rossi et al 2011 which also indicated this synthetic wastewater was a valid representation to field production wastewater 3 2 effects of debrominated production wastewater on dbp formation during chlorination of surface and waste waters debrominated production wastewater through ozonation and air purging was spiked into four water samples at the same volume percentages the ozone aeration process was effective in removing the majority of bromide from production wastewater and would be of great significance for practical applications additionally the debromination process was also necessary to remove the naturally occurring bromide as high as 0 01 in the nacl chemical that was used to make the synthetic production wastewater after such debromination treatment the bromide residuals were low which led to decreased formation of brominated dbps below 5 μg l and some chlorinated dbps after chlorination for example the chloroform in three natural waters decreased by 6 10 while its proportion in thm dropped from 91 94 to 88 92 as spiking percentage increased chloroform decreased 4 in treated wastewater fig 2 a however some chlorinated dbps were found increased as spiking percentage increased when the creek water reservoir water and treated wastewater contained 0 1 of debrominated production wastewater the formation of tcaa increased by 10 17 fig 2c while dcan increased by 20 29 in all four waters fig 2d these increases could have been more significant if no bromide residual existed this indicated the existence of considerable synergistic effects of non bromide species on dbp formation at 0 1 of debrominated production wastewater the total molar concentration of metal ions na ca2 mg2 ba2 and sr2 have achieved 1 54 mm which could potentially interact with organic precursors to catalyze dbp formation as reported in some other studies navalon et al 2009 liu et al 2012 gan et al 2016 zhao et al 2016 neither notable increase nor decrease was found on dcaa formation in four waters fig 2b 3 3 effects of debrominated production wastewater on dbp formation during chlorination of synthetic citric acid and humic acid solutions field waters containing unidentified organics and ions could introduce uncertainties to the promotional effects of debrominated production wastewater on dbp yields during water chlorination to reduce these potential interferences humic acid was selected as an individual natural organic matter while citric acid as a surrogate with small molecular weight clear structure and functional groups to study the mechanisms navalon et al 2009 zhao et al 2016 both solutions were prepared with a toc at 3 mg l when the spiking percentage of debrominated production wastewater was as low as 0 005 metal ion concentration was 0 08 mm chloroform dcaa and chloral hydrate increased by 400 510 and 520 respectively compared with no wastewater addition when using citric acid as organic precursor fig 3 a this might be due to the complexation between organic precursors and metal ions which enhanced the dbp formation during chlorination navalon et al 2009 liu et al 2012 hu et al 2016 zhao et al 2016 tcaa and dcan were hardly detected generally below 3 μg l during the whole process which indicated citric acid was not a precursor for tcaa and dcan zhao et al 2016 for humic acid solution the increases of chloroform dcan and chloral hydrate formation at 0 005 spiking percentage only reached 7 9 and 10 and no significant impacts were found on either dcaa or tcaa fig 3b the difference of functional groups on humic acid and on citric acid may result in the different levels of enhancement for example studies indicated that carboxylate groups might be the main places where complexation occurred that increased the reactivity towards chlorination navalon et al 2009 while citric acid contains much higher portion of carboxylate groups than humic acid does according to their molecular structures in addition as spiking percentages of debrominated production wastewater increased the formation of chloroform dcaa and chloral hydrate in citric acid group increased by 920 830 and even 3600 respectively at 0 03 spiking ratio metal ion concentration was 0 46 mm and then chloroform and dcaa decreased due to elevated bromide residuals fig 3a chloral hydrate has been regulated at 10 μg l as chloral in china and 20 μg l in australia wang et al 2015 which are much lower than thms and haas for humic acid solution the increase of chloroform reached the highest of 13 when spiking percentage was 0 03 followed by a slight decrease while dcaa and tcaa reached 6 and 16 respectively at 0 1 spiking percentage dcan and chloral hydrate had their highest increases of 41 and 35 when 0 05 of debrominated production wastewater was added fig 3b there were little effects on tcaa in citric acid solution and dcaa in humic acid solution it is important to note that some critical species did not show significant increase because their yields were under the negative influence of bromide residuals 3 4 effects of individual cations and anions on dbp formation during chlorination of citric acid solution to better understand the mechanisms of metal ions enhancing dbp formation these metal ions were discussed individually following the same process individual ca2 mg2 and ba2 aqueous solutions were prepared by dissolving their nitrate salts into distilled water at the same concentrations as they were found in production wastewater citric acid was again used as the organic precursor after chlorination chloral hydrate dcan and brominated species were all found below 1 μg l when citric acid solution contained as low as 0 005 of calcium solution ca2 0 01 mm the concentrations of chloroform and dcaa increased by 340 and 270 while 135 and 130 for magnesium solution mg2 0 002 mm and 25 and 15 for barium solution ba2 0 001 mm respectively fig 4 as the spiking percentage increased the synergistic effect of magnesium eventually exceeded that of calcium at the highest volume percentage 0 1 of metal ion solutions the formation of chloroform and dcaa increased by 10 and 7 times for calcium solution while 18 and 10 times for magnesium solution even though magnesium concentration was five times lower than that of calcium this might be caused by the higher competence of mg citrate chelates in facilitating dbp yields compared to ca citrate since evidence indicated that magnesium and calcium had similar binding capacities with citric acid smith and martell 1989 at this spiking percentage barium also achieved its largest enhancement on the yields of chloroform and dcaa at 79 and 84 respectively under the impact of 0 1 of mg2 ca2 and ba2 the chloroform concentrations were 229 132 and 21 μg l while dcaa were 121 86 and 20 μg l respectively fig 4 it was concluded that at low spiking percentages of production wastewater 0 05 calcium played the main role of enhancing dbp formation due to its greatest concentration however as spiking percentage increased the largest contributor became magnesium due to the higher competence of its chelates in enhancing dbp formation even though its molarity was still five times lower than that of calcium studies suggested that the complexations of these metal ions with citric acid occurred at a 1 1 m ratio to form negatively charged complexes joseph 1946 to study these mechanisms the material relations in complexation process were presented in eqs 1 4 while the related dbp formation is shown in eq 5 plaza et al 2006 zhao and xie 2016 1 m l m l 2 k m l m l 3 m m l m t o t a l 4 l m l l t o t a l 5 f p l f p l m l f p m l where m denotes free metal ions l is free organic precursor citric acid ml is the complex of metal ions and organic precursor m citrate k is stability constant means the concentration of each substance mtotal and ltotal are the concentrations of total metal ions and organic precursors fp is dbp formation potential fpl is dbp formation potential by free organic precursor fpml is dbp formation potential by the complex the relation between ml and mtotal is shown in eq 6 where ltotal was fixed at 0 042 mm the chelate stability constants k of calcium magnesium and barium with citric acid were obtained from a published source at 2 818 mmol 1 2 818 mmol 1 and 0 537 mmol 1 respectively smith and martell 1989 the plot of eq 6 for three metals was illustrated in fig 5 by combining eqs 1 6 into eq 7 and fitting it to experimental data points we were able to calculate the dbp formation potentials by free organic precursor fpl and chelate fpml the results were illustrated in fig 6 6 m l 1 2 m t o t a l l t o t a l 1 k 1 2 m t o t a l l t o t a l 1 k 2 m t o t a l l t o

fpl and fpml were calculated for different metal ions and dbp species before tabulated into table 2 it showed that the fpml was orders of magnitude higher than fpl and the magnesium complex resulted in much higher fpml than calcium s and barium s complexes did free citric acid generated slightly more chloroform than dcaa while the chelates enlarged this difference significantly all these indicated that metal ions could greatly impact dbp formation and speciation through the formation of chelates although this mechanism exploration only involved citric acid the enhancement of non bromide ions on dbp formation when using humic acid may operate in a similar way more research is under way for the mechanism study in shale gas production industry elevated so4 2 was found in treated effluent since it was usually applied excessively by treatment facilities for ba2 removal prior to discharge warner et al 2013 the effects of it as well as other original anion cl on dbp formation were investigated in this research no3 was studied as control due to its incorporation into cations tested above three anions in their sodium salts were dissolved to the same mole concentration as calcium 241 mm and then added into citric acid solution at different spiking percentages followed by chlorination chloroform and dcaa were two main species analyzed this time since both tcaa and chloral hydrate were observed below 2 μg l compared to cl and no3 so4 2 played a more significant role on dbp formation the addition of so4 2 at 0 5 spiking percentage increased the formations of chloroform and dcaa by 37 and 44 respectively this indicates that the discharge of treated production wastewater containing elevated sulfate may increase the sulfate level in receiving waters and enhance dbp formation in downstream water treatment plant in addition to sulfate sulfite has been found involved in the formation of some new dbps while being used as a dechlorination agent which provide sulfo group for the byproducts gong and zhang 2015 although sulfite concentration in produced water is at trace levels further research could involve the impacts of trace anions on dbp formation 4 conclusion in summary this study investigated the effects of bromide and non bromide ions in shale gas production wastewater on dbp formation by simulating its spills and discharge into surface waters we compared complexation with dbp derivation to investigate the mechanisms of metal ions enhancing dbp formation individual organic precursors were adopted to simplify this process bromide in production wastewater largely enhanced the formation of brominated dbps at the expenses of their chlorinated analogues debrominated production wastewater considerably increased formations of some chlorinated dbps such as tcaa and dcan in selected field water samples which was mainly caused by the catalytic effects of metal organic chelates this effect followed the sequence of magnesium calcium barium when citric acid was used as the precursor enhanced dbp formation was also observed in elevated sulfate solution compared with other anions overall our results provided the evidence that both bromide and non bromide ions presented in production wastewater could enhance dbp formation the specific halide removal process may not be adequate to eliminate deleterious effects of production wastewater further studies should focus on salinity removal technologies such as reverse osmosis nanofiltration electrodialysis ion exchange and lime soda ash softening acknowledgements

19397,concentrated wastewaters from agricultural industries represent a key opportunity for the upcycling of organics nitrogen and phosphorus to higher value products such as microbial protein phototrophic or photosynthetic microbes very effectively capture input organics and nutrients as microbial protein this study compares purple phototrophic bacteria ppb and microalgae photosynthesis for this purpose treating real high strength poultry processing wastewater in continuous photo bioreactors utilising infrared ir and white light wl respectively both reactors could effectively treat the wastewaters and at similar loading rates 4 kgcod m 3d 1 the infrared reactor irr was irradiated at 18 w m 2 and the white light reactor wlr reactor at 1 5 2 times this the irr could remove up to

graphical abstract image 1 keywords agri industrial resource recovery wastewater photobioreactor ppb 1 introduction with the shift in wastewater treatment from pollutant removal to resource recovery concentrated wastewaters from agricultural industries are major low hanging fruit opportunities to recover resources angenent et al 2004 this is because they represent a concentrated source of nutrients and organic carbon with less variety of microbial metal and organic contaminants generally present in domestic wastewater use of industrial wastewater also avoids input of human specific pathogens commonly present in domestic wastewater as well as other regulatory barriers governing input of domestic sewage into the human food chain this mandates that on site human sewage does not enter the industrial wastewater stream but instead be directed to the urban sewer system in this context and compared with traditional treatment resource recovery from agri industrial streams can a achieve lower wastewater treatment costs by offsetting costs with value from generated products e g fertilizer proteins biogas corominas et al 2013 mo and zhang 2013 b lower product production costs of these products by using recycled raw materials in the wastewater such as organics nitrogen and phosphorus matassa et al 2015 foley et al 2010 and c reduce environmental impacts by substitution of nitrogen n otherwise generated from the haber bosch process rockström et al 2009 economic analysis has demonstrated that resource recovery technologies can be economically competitive with traditional treatment processes particularly where a higher value high quantity product is generated burgess et al 2015 a key option for efficient resource recovery from wastewater is the partitioning of soluble organic matter and nutrients into a concentrated separable solid phase batstone et al 2015 this can be achieved via biological assimilation where organic matter n and phosphorus p are removed simultaneously preferably non destructively and incorporated into protein rich biomass both microalgae and purple phototrophic bacteria ppbs are promising candidates achieving biomass yields close to unity buitrón et al 2018 hülsen et al 2016a and high protein contents of up to 60 by dry weight shipman et al 1975 brown 1991 microalgae have been extensively studied for the production of feed and feed additives e g for fish pets and farm animals as well as humans spolaore et al 2006 and are mainly produced in open high rate algal ponds hrap developed almost 60 years ago oswald and golueke 1960 although tanks tubes and fermenters have been applied borowitzka 1999 to date full scale microalgae production mainly to produce biodiesel is almost exclusively carried out in hrap where closed photobioreactors remain too expensive for efficient mass production savage 2011 park et al 2011 compared to microalgae ppbs have been far less studied which concerns the production as well as the application as feed a few studies are dealing with ppb as feed additive for aquaculture chowdhury et al 2016 banerjee et al 2000 loo et al 2015 and chicken ponsano et al 2004 where axenic ppb cultures grown on artificial media were utilized in this context the carotenoid and vitamin content in ppbs has been researched in more detail takeno et al 1999 but larger scale production has only been reported in a handful of papers in mixed cultures with microalgae also in open ponds kobayashi et al 1971 kobayashi and tchan 1973 reports of large scale probiotics production in china qi et al 2009 which contains fractions of ppb and is not selective and therefore not considered in the single cell protein context energy input as light is a key consideration for both microalgae and ppb with rather inefficient use of photons for oxygenic and anoxygenic photosynthesis 10 melis 2009 adessi and de philippis 2014 ppb also grow effectively on volatile fatty acids vfas but can utilize a variety of other organic substrates such as sugars and alcohols for photoheterotrophic metabolism imam et al 2013 kim et al 2004 algae preferentially utilizes co2 azov et al 1982 craggs et al 2011 to

might not be removed but instead transformed first to organic acids zhang et al 2009 and subsequently to microbial biomass by ppb competition for macronutrients can become secondary due to carbon limitations in both microalgal and ppb systems community stability is crucial for effective wastewater treatment and consistent product generation a microbial community can be syntrophic parasitic competitive or a combination of these with changes in wastewater composition resulting in community shifts schlüter et al 1987 it may be difficult to maintain a stable community thereby affecting wastewater treatment performance and protein product consistency in the non sterile wastewater environment this has been reported for microalgae especially in open highly loaded systems taiganides 1992 and is commonly referred to as albazod algae bacteria zooplankton and detritus this community can be very efficient at removing cod n and p but may also deteriorate over time oswald 1980 similarly both syntrophy and competition have been reported for anaerobic systems with ppbs izu et al 2001 however studies investigating the long term effects of organic rich wastewater on the ppb and flanking community are scarce a previous study with domestic wastewater hülsen et al 2016a reported a consistent dominance of ppb species in non sterile wastewater treatment system other studies reported direct competition of ppb with sulfate reducing bacteria srb for hydrogen and volatile fatty acids in the presence of sulfate gibson 1990 and srb can outgrow ppb at higher loading rates chiemchaisri et al 2007 this present study aims to determine and compare the effect of organic rich wastewater on infrared selected ppb and white light selected microalgae and the effect on the community dominance at the same time the overall wastewater treatment capacities and the metabolic modes will be determined and compared with focus on the assimilatory removal of cod n and p and the formation of protein rich biomass for this purpose continuous open aerobic microalgae or closed anaerobic ppb photobioreactors were operated in comparative mode biomass characteristics and product consistency are also assessed in view of applications as a feed or feed additive or as an organic fertilizer 2 material and methods poultry processing plants require between 19 and 38 l of water to process a bird and considering 9 billion birds were processed in 2007 in the us alone kiepper et al 2008 this tremendous amount of wastewater is an important potential source of nutrients organics in this wastewater are 95 degradable by anaerobic anaerobic chávez et al 2005 and aerobic rusten et al 1998 treatment which is a prerequisite for efficient biomass growth the direct recovery of proteins

wastewater batches of around 60 l wastewater were collected monthly from a poultry processing facility in brisbane australia the wastewater was a combination of process water from feather removal and degutting as well as general cleaning water e g from cleaning of floors at the facility the wastewater is usually pre screened 3 mm and directed towards a dissolved air flotation daf unit the daf influent was the wastewater sampled and used in this study after collection the wastewater was transported in jerry cans at room temperature 30 min transport time in a air conditioned car and immediately stored in a 4 c cold room from this storage wastewater was weekly pumped to an influent tank in the laboratory after discarding the residues from a previous week of operation an additional sieve 1 0 mm mesh width regularly cleaned was used at the suction side of the influent pump to prevent clogging due to solids the raw wastewater contained on average 4000 mgtcod l 1 200 mgtkn l 1 and 35 mgtp l 1 with significant variations in different periods during period iii tn and tp increased up to 500 mg l 1 and 55 mg l 1 whilst tcod remained stable the tcod increased during period iv a detailed composition analysis and the average cod tn and tp concentrations of each period are in supplementary materials table s1 and fig s1 and each period is further described as part of the bioreactor operation changes in wastewater composition resulted from the discharge of different streams such as process water from feather removal and degutting high cod tn and tp as well as differences in general cleaning water amounts the wastewater of the poultry processing factory is not buffered onsite because large downstream covered anaerobic lagoons have sufficient hydraulic retention hrt 20 d to tolerate peak loads within the system 2 2 inoculum the continuous anaerobic reactor described below was inoculated with 10 v v of ppb from a domestic wastewater enrichment culture around 1 0 gvs l 1 as described elsewhere hülsen et al 2016b we note that inoculum from any mixed microbial source poultry source wastewater would be feasible hülsen et al 2018 microalgae was isolated from effluent evaporation ponds at a piggery in south australia and cultured in 160 ml serum flasks open to the atmosphere illuminated with a full spectrum at 130 w m 2 by two 150 w

be determined to be approximately 15 h 1 based on the 1st order model of tchobanoglous et al 2003 additional oxygen was supplied via photosynthesis which was estimated at 1000 mg o2 m2 d 1 or 2 8 mg l

flood light nelson lighting tonbridge uk the closed anaerobic irr was illuminated with three ir led lamps 24 w each ir 96 led illuminator for night vision camera st louis mo usa with a spectral distribution of 800 900 nm and a peak at 850 nm the spatial distribution of the irradiance was determined for both reactors by taking various measurements along the irradiated surface using a spectroradiometer stellarnet blue wave spectroradiometer warsash scientific australia fifty scans were taken and averaged for each point on the surface the average irradiance of the wlr was 170 w m 2

attenuation of light in the wl and ir reactors were determined using the beer lambert law the attenuation for different concentrations of biomass were calculated and plotted for this analysis the wavelength for the wl reactor was assumed to be a mean of 590 nm and 850 nm was assumed as the mean wavelength for the ir reactor the details of the calculations are presented in the supplementary

able to effectively treat the poultry processing wastewater with cod removals averages calculated between day 20 day 243 averaging 98 1 0 5 for the wlr and 92 1 5 for the irr this was with sustained loading rates up to 15 kgcod m 3d 1 and a short hrt of 1 0 d effluent tcod was 110 mg l 1 and 296 mg l 1 respectively the ph averaged 7 0 for the wlr and 7 5 for the irr with a standard deviation of 0 2 units on both the two reactors achieved similar tn removals being specifically 68 6 for the wlr and 63 5 for the irr average effluent tn concentrations were 74 mg l 1 and 93 mg l 1 respectively the average tp removal over time day 20 day 243 was 26 2 9 for the wlr and 35 5 3 0 for the irr with final effluent concentrations of 27 mgp l 1 and 24 mgp l 1 respectively tcod tn and tp removal efficiencies changed over time in both reactors with average removal efficiencies for the various treatment periods being significantly different p 0 05 fig 2 a c nevertheless measured tn and tp removals were similar during specific periods e g tn and tp in period iii p 0 05 tp in period iv p 0 05 tn in period v p 0 05 and mostly coincided with changes in influent wastewater composition strength the bioreactors showed improved tn and tp removal performance with higher wastewater strength period iii and iv fig 3 the tcod tn and tp effluent concentrations time series are shown in fig s5 the decrease in hrt from 2 0 d to 1 0 d did not significantly affect average tcod removal performance in either of the two reactors however during period iv with the high cod influent the removal performance of the wlr was stable whereas the irr showed a progressive increase of up to 700 mgcod l 1 in the effluent partly explained by an increase in vfa cod fig s6 the tn removal performance increased with increasing influent tn up to 785 mg l 1 during period iii fig 2b and effluent tn concentrations remained similar to that observed in periods i and ii this increased n removal was likely achieved by retaining organically bound n in the sludge however tn effluent concentrations decreased during period iv despite increased cod influent concentrations during this period also indicating assimilative n removal average n removal was not significantly different between periods iii and v however the main nitrogen species in treated effluent from the wlr was nitrate as opposed to ammonium in the irr effluent fig s7 suggesting that fundamentally different n removal pathways were giving similar removal performance excess nitrification also caused the tn efficiency drop in the wlr around day 140 which resulted from a programmable logic controller interruption stopping the influent pump but not the air supply total phosphorus removal was not affected by the hrt change period i and ii the tp increase in the influent during period iii translated into a higher tp concentration in the effluent fig s1 however tp concentration in the effluent decreased during period iv despite higher cod influent concentrations thought to be due to assimilative tp removal as described for tn above overall discharge limits to e g surface waters were not achieved in the one step treatment but depending on legislation the application as irrigation water might be feasible 3 2 cod n and p recovery mass balance over 124 days of operation for the wlr showed that a major fraction of the cod was lost 64 1 6 likely dissipated via respiration to co2 at the same time 25 1 4 of the nitrogen n was lost probably by stripping of ammonia or nitrification denitrification garcía et al 2000 mass balances for phosphorus p and potassium k indicated closure at 103 4 0 4 and 107 1 8 0 overall 32 7 2 0 of cod 36 2 0 7 of n and 28 6 0 4 of p in the influent was assimilated retained as biomass product in the wlr with the irr the recovery of tcod via vfas cod to biomass of 48 7 1 0 n 45 7 2 0 and p 44 3 0 was higher than in the wlr overall n and k balances on the irr also showed reasonable closure at 100 7 1 2 and 97 9 1 9 respectively off gas production irr measured a gas flow tipping bucket gas meter of around 1 2 l over the entire reactor operation with minor amounts of methane 2 9 ch4 2 8 co2 standard deviation of 1 5 on both and negligible hydrogen 0 01 this represents a negligible cod loss through methanogenesis a significant proportion of p was lost with only 80 4 0 of the influent load being recovered in effluent or sludge this loss of p is likely due to p precipitation with ca and mg and settling of precipitates to the bottom of the reactor despite the vigorous gas mixing applied during the tests partly caused by the elevated ph detailed progressive cumulative tcod n and p mass balances are presented in the supplementary materials figs s8 and s9 for reference 3 3 biomass characteristics the biomass characteristics of both reactors were well in line with literature values reported by shipman et al 1975 ppb and anupama and ravindra 2000 microalgae as well as a more recent comparison between microalgae fungi bacteria and ppb puyol et al 2016 biomass characteristics were affected by the influent composition of each operation period however comparing the crude protein calculated from particulate tkn content of periods i and ii over 143 d shows that both reactors generated biomass with 0 6 gcrude protein cp gts 1 compared to 0 6 0 65 and 0 45 0 65 gcp gts 1 puyol et al 2016 with average biomass yields for the irr and the wlr of 0 5 0 1 gcod gcod 1 and 0 3 0 2 gcod gcod 1 extracted from tcod sludge fractions in fig 4 the average biomass yield of the irr was up to 60 higher than that of the wlr at the same time the n and p content and tcod vs ratios of the biomass were essentially the same for both reactors 1 4 p and 10 n and 1 5 0 1 tcod vs data not shown the total protein content according to the amino acid analysis was higher in the irr biomass 460 mg amino acid gts 1 or 502 mg gvs 1 than in the wlr biomass 380 mg gts 1 or 390 mg gvs 1 also well in line with above cited literature fig 5 amino acid composition was only considered during period i and ii n 5 because particulate matter and increased crude protein cp content in higher strength influent wastewater of later operating periods the cp influent concentration during these periods increased to 3 4 g l 1 which means at least part of this protein is measured together with the ppb protein in the reactor anaerobic protein hydrolysis and fermentation to vfa co2 and nh4 n is commonly not complete due to thermodynamic stoichiometric ramsay and pullammanappallil 2001 and kinetic effects christ et al 2000 when harvesting the reactor biomass the total protein measurements also contained poultry processing wastewater proteins that are naturally parts of the solids this potentially interfered with the ppb protein profile during period ii and iv this would need to be considered if microbial protein were the goal with waste chicken fraction being acceptable e g for fish feed samocha et al 2004 or better solids removal would be required metal contaminants were also tested and were generally low with cd ni and as being undetectable 0 00 mg kg pb and cu being 0 4 mg kg and zn being 1 0 mg kg which would allow the global application as fertilizer and animal feed in china and canada following the limits values summarised by wang et al 2017 there were no systematic differences between the two products this offers no barriers to application of the final product as feed or fertilizer further information is provided in table s2 3 4 microbial analysis the microbial analysis of the wlr showed that photosynthetic organisms were present over the reactor operation period but did not dominate fig 6 the highest relative abundance of phototrophic organisms was 20 93 d with chlorella being the most abundant genus 16 at 93 d a variety of cyanobacteria chorophyta green non sulfur chloroflexi green sulfur chlorobi and purple phototrophic bacteria blastochloris rhodobacter rubivax thiocapsa were present as flanking phototrophs at less than 3 relative abundance the flanking ppb can act as aerobic anoxygenic phototrophs yurkov and beatty 1998 contributing to cod and nitrogen removal at high dissolved oxygen previously reported lu et al 2017 the wlr non phototrophic community was generally comprised of common facultative aerobic heterotrophs frequently detected in aerobic systems including comamonadaceae acidovorax hydrogenphaga schlegelella xanthobacteraceae xanthobacter dokdonella 4 12 relative abundance chitinophagaceae 0 17 38 and ellin6075 0 04 3 cao et al 2014 oren 2014 rosenberg 2014 but shifted over time this distribution also explains the neutral ph of the wlr were algae consumed inorganic carbon originating from organic carbon conversion by heterotrophs the shannon evenness index e was stable around 0 67 indicating very small changes of the diversity in the wlr community over time this indicates white light did not create a selection advantage for microalgae which would have resulted in dominance and a subsequent decreased equitability over time in contrast to the wlr the evenness index for the irr decreased from 0 6 to 0 4 in the irr over time fig 6 this indicates reduced diversity due to increased dominance of ppb driven by ir in combination with increased influent cod which also resulted in increased vfa cod concentrations in the reactor 200 mg vfa cod l 1 as show in fig s6 the vfa cod reactor concentration had significant effect of the relative abundances of ppb over time p 0 022 the most abundant ppb species was rhodopseudomonas palustris up to 50 followed by rhodobacter sphaeroides up to 23 and a variety of flanking ppbs including rubrivivax sp rhodocyclus sp blastochloris sp allochromatium and thiocapsa sp each max 1 0 the community shifted towards ppb dominance whereby changing influent conditions and particularly high influent cod period iv day 201 favoured rps palustris at day 201 the flanking community was comprised of a diverse mix of common representatives in anaerobic digesters including a variety of bacteroidetes dysgonomonas 10 7 201 d proteobacteria moraxellaceae 11 168 d and firmicutes carnobacterium 8 6 159 d that degrade oligomers such as fats carbohydrates and proteins into smaller subunits such as vfas and nh4 n wang et al 2014 utilized by ppbs to produce protein rich biomass interestingly methanogens specifically fast growing hydrogenotrophs did not become established and were present at low relative abundance of 3 0 at day 168 and generally below 1 0 aligning with the minimal methane production observed 3 5 comparing wl and ir reactors performance both bioreactor systems were able to simultaneously remove organic matter n and p from poultry processing wastewater at reasonable loading rates average 4 0 kg m 3 d 1 and reasonable hrt 1 0 d the comparison showed similar overall removal performance by the two reactors with 42 less effective irradiance in the irr comparing 18 w m 2 with 31 w m 2 par when considering emitted illumination the savings increases to 90 comparing ir irradiance 18 w m 2 with a full spectra 170 wm 2 we acknowledge that efficient uv vis leds would more efficiently deliver the same par output but will never approach the efficiency of ir illumination for artificial illumination we further note light attenuation is strongly impacted by biomass concentration and wavelength white light is not attenuated in pure water over 50 mm while ir light is attenuated by 20 fig s10 however even at 0 2 gvss l 1 ir light is less attenuated than wl 90 over 50 mm for ir vs 95 for wl penetration depth for both in the presence of biomass is comparably small being 5 mm for wl at 2 0 gvss l 1 vs 10 mm for ir this emphasises the importance of mixing and hydrodynamics in delivering the microorganisms to the irradiated surface as opposed to delivering photons to the microorganisms bitog et al 2011 microbial community and yield as expected in the wlr aerobic microalgae were not the main mediator for wastewater treatment and biomass assimilation hülsen et al 2018 this contrasts with previous reports where similar intensities to the 30 w m 2 par were able to support non photo inhibited microalgae nannochloropsis chlorella spirulina growth even at peak growth rates sforza et al 2012 simionato et al 2013 gouveia and oliveira 2009 the applied srt was above the minimum for rhodobacter sphaeroides chlorella sorokiniana and spirulina platensis ogbonna et al 2000 this is further supported by specific growth rates of chlorella sorokiniana and leptolyngbya 0 32 d 1on glucose wan et al 2011 or 0 24 0 27 on bicarbonate janssen et al 1999 0 40 d 1 on co2 van der grinten et al 2005 the key difference is likely due to two factors i the air supplied through membrane scouring and mixing and ii the complex wastewater source therefore treatment of this type of wastewater always results in albazod referring to the diverse community of algae bacteria zooplankton and detritus hargreaves 2006 population shifts in open microalgal ponds due to grazing and population losses are density depended whether fed with wastewater or pure substrates day 2013 and observed in pilot and large scale ponds in a sophisticated 10 year study in singapore taiganides 1992 this mixed bacterial dominated community of the wlr resulted in a similar yield 0 34 0 01 gcod gcod 1 compared to yields obtained in conventional aerobic systems which have up to 20 d srt at 20 c 0 3 0 4 gcod gcod 1 tchobanoglous et al 2003 as well as high rate activated systems with srt of 2 d jimenez et al 2015 in contrast the measured yields for the irr 0 5 0 01 gcod gcod 1 fell within in the broad range of values reported in the literature for mostly axenic ppb cultures treating various agri industrial wastewaters tuna condensate shrimp blanching water 0 24 prasertsan et al 1993 mandarin orange peel 0 83 sasaki et al 1991 and sago starch processing decanter 0 59 gcod gcod 1 getha et al 1998 the measured yields were lower than that reported for a mixed ppb community treating domestic wastewater 1 0 gcod gcod 1 hülsen et al 2016a which is likely attributed to the decreased relative ppb abundance 50 compared to 80 induced by high poultry wastewater influent cod and the need of e g fermenting bacteria to transform the oligomers into vfas despite the anaerobic conditions anaerobic protozoa can also graze and pose a potential threat to ppbs schulz et al 1990 and further research is required to clarify these effects for large scale production systems amino acid profile in comparison with fishmeal fao 1970 the overall protein level and hence amino acid content was lower in both reactors based on a crude protein content of 60 around 190 kg irr and 140 kg wlr of crude protein could be recovered per tonne of influent cod per day from poultry processing wastewater calculated following eq 3 the influence of non degraded influent protein on the biomass characteristics could be reduced by buffering to avoid peak loads which would also allow for a degree of pre acidification in terms of the single cell protein scp quality a stable microbial community is advantageous as product quality consistency and therefore potential value are likely improved as such ppb can produce a more consistent product when treating organic rich wastewaters because of the dominance by ppb as compared to an albazod based system however for the overall biomass protein content and recovery this would be secondary because protein residues already present in the raw wastewater could contribute to the harvested product we note that e g in the european union eu 2002 high grade feed mixtures are downgraded to lower categories if co mixed animal by products e g scp produced on wastewater have a low grade woodgate and van der veen 2004 which likely impacts the scp value but does not prohibit the application in general in terms of price this may lead to a preference for non animal derived wastewaters e g sugar mill stillage and these aspects require further clarification however we note that e g sugar mill wastewater also has drawbacks as it a does not contain sufficient macro and micronutrients b production is seasonal and c wastewater is recycled within the process throughout the production season personal communication with the management of the condong sugar mill australia and stream inventory campaign data not shown 3 6 significance for agricultural industrial wastewater treatment treatment of poultry processing wastewater in the present study did not achieve typical surface water discharge limits tcod 100 tn 10 and tp 1 0 mg l 1 and barely achieved irrigation water limits however the results did show that with sufficient influent cod significant amounts of n and p can be assimilated at average volumetric loads of 4 0 3 1 kgtcod m3 d 0 3 0 19 kgtn m 3 d 1 and 0 03 0 01 kgtp m 3 d 1 instead of producing low value biogas and operating at low biomass yields without nutrient recovery an scp concept could increase microbial yields as well as upgrade nutrients to valuable products rather than aiming to reduce sludge production as in traditional wastewater treatment a scp concept aims for maximum recovery of cod n and p which are then considered to be valuable resources there is an increasing interest in value add products and the upgrading of e g low value methane strong et al 2016 in this context burgess et al 2015 has determined that on a mass load basis from domestic wastewater input loads the value of microbial biomass is approximately 3 times that of biogas however this applied a relatively low value of aud 0 2 kg 1 to microbial biomass the results showed that irr has the potential to produce around 500 kg of protein rich biomass cod per tonne of influent cod assuming the presence of adequate amounts of n and p this achieves a significantly larger recoverable fraction in the wastewater treatment as compared to conventional anaerobic methanogenic technologies although the amino acid content of the recovered product was lower than fishmeal the data suggested that at least a fraction of fishmeal could be substituted with the biomass product where the value of fishmeal is between 1400 and 1800 usd tonne 1 asche et al 2013 which would result in 10 times higher values compared to biogas following burgess et al 2015 ultimately the value of the biomass has to be determined in feed trials but the relevant literature has already suggested the general applicability of phototrophic bacteria grown in axenic cultures on artificial medium banerjee et al 2000 azad et al 2002 kim and lee 2000 however for axenic cultures grown on artificial medium the production costs would likely exceed the product value and render the protein source economical unfeasible except for exceptionally high value niche applications this has been addressed for microalgae and biofuel production slade and bauen 2013 where the utilisation of wastewater has the potential to reduces the overall production costs park et al 2011 we note axenic cultures are not considered to be directly applicable to wastewater treatment and comparisons and life cycle analysis for ppb biomass are not available in the literature yet the irr could produce a ppb dominated culture with irradiance reduced to 8 0 kwh m 3 18 w m 2 at 18 m2 m 3 based on a volumetric removal rate of up to 3 6 kgcod m 3 d 1 90 cod removal and a yield of 0 5 kgcod kgcod 1 with 1 6 gtcod gvs 1 the net radiation energy required would then be around 7 kwh per dry tonne 25 gj in this case one tonne of ppb contains up to 22 2 gj chemical energy largely sourced from input cod based on 3 86 kwh kgcod 1 mccarty et al 2011 the potential product value in conjunction with the production costs will determine the future payback period and real world applications of a scp mediated system such as ppb technology in parallel resource recovery will become an economic driver in cyclic wastewater treatment and new technologies will be required in place of conventional cradle to grave solutions matassa et al 2015 4 conclusion the comparison of the irr ppb and the wlr albazod showed that both systems removed around 90 cod 90 tn and 40 tp although the underlying processes were fundamentally different the anaerobic ppb reactor outperformed the aerobic system in terms of organics and nutrients assimilation and potential resource recovery as protein rich biomass the biomass of both systems might serve as a future feed or feed additive where the irr was clearly dominated by ppb 55 compared to 20 of microalgae in the wlr which can result in more consistent product quality and value over time wlr systems may be more effective where natural light is preferred or where nutrient removal is more important than resource recovery acknowledgments we gratefully acknowledge dr

19397,concentrated wastewaters from agricultural industries represent a key opportunity for the upcycling of organics nitrogen and phosphorus to higher value products such as microbial protein phototrophic or photosynthetic microbes very effectively capture input organics and nutrients as microbial protein this study compares purple phototrophic bacteria ppb and microalgae photosynthesis for this purpose treating real high strength poultry processing wastewater in continuous photo bioreactors utilising infrared ir and white light wl respectively both reactors could effectively treat the wastewaters and at similar loading rates 4 kgcod m 3d 1 the infrared reactor irr was irradiated at 18 w m 2 and the white light reactor wlr reactor at 1 5 2 times this the irr could remove up to

kwh per dry tonne 1 light input with ppb dominating all samples in comparison the wlr removed up to 98 cod 94 tn and 44 tp at 43 90 higher irradiance compared to the ppb reactor microalgae did not dominate the wlr and the community was instead a mix of microbes algae bacteria zooplankton and detritus albazod with a production of approximately 140 kg crude protein per tonne influent cod graphical abstract image 1 keywords agri industrial resource recovery wastewater photobioreactor ppb 1 introduction with the shift in wastewater treatment from pollutant removal to resource recovery concentrated wastewaters from agricultural industries are major low hanging fruit opportunities to recover resources angenent et al 2004 this is because they represent a concentrated source of nutrients and organic carbon with less variety of microbial metal and organic contaminants generally present in domestic wastewater use of industrial wastewater also avoids input of human specific pathogens commonly present in domestic wastewater as well as other regulatory barriers governing input of domestic sewage into the human food chain this mandates that on site human sewage does not enter the industrial wastewater stream but instead be directed to the urban sewer system in this context and compared with traditional treatment resource recovery from agri industrial streams can a achieve lower wastewater treatment costs by offsetting costs with value from generated products e g fertilizer proteins biogas corominas et al 2013 mo and zhang 2013 b lower product production costs of these products by using recycled raw materials in the wastewater such as organics nitrogen and phosphorus matassa et al 2015 foley et al 2010 and c reduce environmental impacts by substitution of nitrogen n otherwise generated from the haber bosch process rockström et al 2009 economic analysis has demonstrated that resource recovery technologies can be economically competitive with traditional treatment processes particularly where a higher value high quantity product is generated burgess et al 2015 a key option for efficient resource recovery from wastewater is the partitioning of soluble organic matter and nutrients into a concentrated separable solid phase batstone et al 2015 this can be achieved via biological assimilation where organic matter n and phosphorus p are removed simultaneously preferably non destructively and incorporated into protein rich biomass both microalgae and purple phototrophic bacteria ppbs are promising candidates achieving biomass yields close to

reported in a handful of papers in mixed cultures with microalgae also in open ponds kobayashi et al 1971 kobayashi and tchan 1973 reports of large scale probiotics production in china qi et al 2009 which contains fractions of ppb and is not selective and therefore not considered in the single cell protein context energy input as light is a key consideration for both microalgae and ppb with

of other organic substrates such as sugars and alcohols for photoheterotrophic metabolism imam et al 2013 kim et al 2004 algae preferentially utilizes co2 azov et al 1982 craggs et al 2011 to

generally comprises a vast variety of carbon substrates e g 55 3 fat 27 1 protein 7 4 carbohydrates as a of dry matter in poultry processing wastewater kiepper et al 2008 not necessarily preferred for growth and in most cases requires fermentative or oxidative organisms to convert these complex organics to organic acids or co2 respectively reducing equivalents organics chemical oxygen demand cod might not be removed but instead transformed first to organic acids zhang et al 2009 and subsequently to microbial biomass by ppb competition for macronutrients can become secondary due to carbon limitations in both microalgal and ppb systems community stability is crucial for effective wastewater treatment and consistent product generation a microbial community can be syntrophic parasitic competitive or a combination of these with changes in wastewater composition resulting in community shifts schlüter et al 1987 it may be difficult to maintain a stable community thereby affecting wastewater treatment performance and protein product consistency in the non sterile wastewater environment this has been reported for microalgae especially in open highly loaded systems taiganides 1992 and is commonly referred to as albazod algae bacteria zooplankton and detritus this community can be very efficient at removing cod n and p but may also deteriorate over time oswald 1980 similarly both syntrophy and competition have been reported for anaerobic systems with ppbs izu et al 2001 however studies investigating the long term effects of organic rich wastewater on the ppb and flanking community are scarce a previous study with domestic wastewater hülsen et al 2016a reported a consistent dominance of ppb species in non sterile wastewater treatment system other studies reported direct competition of ppb with sulfate reducing bacteria srb for hydrogen and volatile fatty acids in the presence of sulfate gibson 1990 and srb can outgrow ppb at higher loading rates chiemchaisri et al 2007 this present study aims to determine and compare the effect of organic rich wastewater on infrared selected ppb and white light selected microalgae and the effect on the community dominance at the same time the overall wastewater treatment capacities and the metabolic modes will be determined and compared with focus on the assimilatory removal of cod n and p and the formation of protein rich biomass for this purpose continuous open aerobic microalgae or closed anaerobic ppb photobioreactors were operated in comparative mode biomass characteristics and product consistency are also assessed in view of applications as a feed or feed additive or as an organic fertilizer 2 material and methods poultry processing plants require between 19 and 38 l of water to process a bird and considering 9 billion birds were processed in 2007 in the us alone kiepper et al 2008 this tremendous amount of wastewater is an important potential source of nutrients organics in this wastewater are 95 degradable by anaerobic anaerobic chávez et al 2005 and aerobic rusten et al 1998 treatment which is a prerequisite for efficient biomass growth the direct recovery of proteins from this wastewater has been proposed by several authors lo et al 2005 avula et al 2009 and the fact that poultry by products feather meal poultry by product meal hatchery by products spent laying hens are currently utilized for animal feed el boushy and van der poel 2000 make this stream an interesting source for single cell protein production from for agri industrial wastewaters 2 1 raw wastewater batches of around 60 l wastewater were collected monthly from a poultry processing facility in brisbane australia the wastewater was a combination of process water from feather removal and degutting as well as general cleaning water e g from cleaning of floors at the facility the wastewater is usually pre screened 3 mm and directed towards a dissolved air flotation daf unit the daf influent was the wastewater sampled and used in this study after collection the wastewater was transported in jerry cans at room temperature 30 min transport time in a air conditioned car and immediately stored in a 4 c cold room from this storage wastewater was weekly pumped to an influent tank in the laboratory after discarding the residues from a previous week of operation an additional sieve 1 0 mm mesh width regularly cleaned was used at the suction side of the influent pump to prevent clogging due to solids the raw wastewater contained on average 4000 mgtcod l 1 200 mgtkn l 1 and 35 mgtp l 1 with significant variations in different periods during period iii tn and tp increased up to 500 mg l 1 and 55 mg l 1 whilst tcod remained stable the tcod increased during period iv a detailed composition analysis and the average cod tn and tp concentrations of each period are in supplementary materials table s1 and fig s1 and each period is further described as part of the bioreactor operation changes in wastewater composition resulted from the discharge of different streams such as process water from feather removal and degutting high cod tn and tp as well as differences in general cleaning water amounts the wastewater of the poultry processing factory is not buffered onsite because large downstream covered anaerobic lagoons have sufficient hydraulic retention hrt 20 d to tolerate peak loads within the system 2 2 inoculum the continuous anaerobic reactor described below was inoculated with 10 v v of ppb from a domestic wastewater enrichment culture around 1 0 gvs l 1 as described elsewhere hülsen et al 2016b we note that inoculum from any mixed microbial source poultry source wastewater would be feasible hülsen et al 2018 microalgae was isolated from effluent evaporation ponds at a piggery in south australia and cultured in 160 ml serum flasks open to the atmosphere illuminated with a full spectrum at 130 w m 2 by two 150 w fluorescence lamps distance 63 cm and continuously stirred at 100 rpm in an orbital shaker edwards instrument company from existing cultures domestic wastewater was inoculated with 10 v v microalgae on a weekly basis to maintain the cultures in the exponential growth phase 200 ml of the microalgae 1 0 gvs l 1 enrichment culture was used to inoculate the continuous aerobic reactor described below 2 3 white light and infra red light bioreactors wlr and irr the irr and wlr were operated in parallel the irr set up used for the ppb operation was described in detail elsewhere hülsen et al 2016a the wlr set up was similar but open to the atmosphere at the surface both reactors were operated at room temperature averaging 22 c for the wlr reactor and 24 c for the irr reactor standard deviation of 2 c for both both reactors were equipped with a submerged flat sheet membrane with 0 45 mm pore size and 0 12 m2 surface area kubota osaka japan the operating flux of the membrane was on average 0 6 0 2 l m 2 h 1 which is considerable lower than critical flux in the order of 10 20 l m 2 h 1 achilli et al 2011 due to relatively high strength of the feed the membrane was mechanically cleaned every 14 d without backwashing figure 1 provides a schematic set up and pictures of both bioreactors air was introduced at 6 l min 1 oxygen supply capacity of approx 240 mgo2 l 1 h 1 assuming coarse bubble aeration and a standard transfer efficiency of 3 m 1 with an air compressor knf neuberger laboport n86kt 18 to mix the wlr and to supply co2 and o2 given the cod consumption of 60 mg l 1 h 1 kla could be determined to be approximately 15 h 1 based on the 1st order model of tchobanoglous et al 2003 additional oxygen was supplied via photosynthesis which was estimated at 1000 mg o2 m2 d 1 or 2 8 mg l 1 h 1 at 31 w m2 at 3 quantum yield and 0 1 mole o2 per mole photons 2 46 105 j mol 1 par cuaresma et al 2009 the wlr was illuminated from one side with a full spectra 150 w fluorescence lamp clamp flood light nelson lighting tonbridge uk the closed anaerobic irr was illuminated with three ir led lamps 24 w each ir 96 led illuminator for night vision camera st louis mo usa with a spectral distribution of 800 900 nm and a peak at 850 nm the spatial distribution of the irradiance was determined for both reactors by taking various measurements along the irradiated surface using a spectroradiometer stellarnet blue wave spectroradiometer warsash scientific australia fifty scans were taken and averaged for each point on the surface the average irradiance of the wlr was 170 w m 2 340 1110 nm or 31 w m 2 of photo active radiation par 400 700 nm which is equivalent to 153 μe m 2 s 1 1 w m 2 4 94 mol m 2 s 2 for par doucha and lívanský 2009 this irradiance intensity is common for low intensity indoor illumination of microalgae growth reactors to provide healthy growth that is not photo inhibited chini zittelli et al 2000 mirón et al 2003 the average irradiance of the irr was 18 7 w m 2 ir 750 900 nm realised by adjusting the distance from emitter to reactor the spatial distribution and outputs of the lamps are presented in the supplementary materials figs s2 and s3 the attenuation of light in the wl and ir reactors were determined using the beer lambert law the attenuation for different concentrations of biomass were calculated and plotted for this analysis the wavelength for the wl reactor was assumed to be a mean of 590 nm and 850 nm was assumed as the mean wavelength for the ir reactor the details of the calculations are presented in the supplementary materials fig s10 the bioreactors were operated for 243 days which was split into five periods period i 01 75 d period ii 76 143 d period iii 144 174 d period iv 175 226 d and period v 227 243 d during period i the bioreactors were operated at 2 0 d hrt and this was shortened to and maintained at 1 0 d hrt until the end of the tests period ii v the major differences between each period were the wastewater compositions with low cod n and p during period i and ii high tn and tp during period iii and high cod tn and tp during period iv and conditions similar to period i and ii during period v fluctuations caused by grab sampling also see fig s1 for comparative influent concentrations analyses were generally done 3 times weekly contents were regularly withdrawn to control the srt around 2 0 d and 3 0 d in the irr and wlr to support ppb and microalgae growth at high influent cod concentrations following ogbonna et al 2000 the vlrs of both reactors increased from 2 0 to 3 0 gtcod l 1d 1

able to effectively treat the poultry processing wastewater with cod removals averages calculated between day 20 day 243 averaging 98 1 0 5 for the wlr and 92 1 5 for the irr this was with sustained loading rates up to 15 kgcod m 3d 1 and a short hrt of 1 0 d effluent tcod was 110 mg l 1 and 296 mg l 1 respectively the ph averaged 7 0 for the wlr and 7 5 for the irr with a standard deviation of 0 2 units on both the two reactors achieved similar tn removals being specifically 68 6 for the wlr and 63 5 for the irr average effluent tn concentrations were 74 mg l 1 and 93 mg l 1 respectively the average tp removal over time day 20 day 243 was 26 2 9 for the wlr and 35 5 3 0 for the irr with final effluent concentrations of 27 mgp l 1 and 24 mgp l 1 respectively tcod tn and tp removal efficiencies changed over time in both reactors with average removal efficiencies for the various treatment periods being significantly different p 0 05 fig 2 a c nevertheless measured tn and tp removals were similar during specific periods e g tn and tp in period iii p 0 05 tp in period iv p 0 05 tn in period v p 0 05 and mostly coincided with changes in influent wastewater composition strength the bioreactors showed improved tn and tp removal performance with higher wastewater strength period iii and iv fig 3 the tcod tn and tp effluent concentrations time series are shown in fig s5 the decrease in hrt from 2 0 d to 1 0 d did not significantly affect average tcod removal performance in either of the two reactors however during period iv with the high cod influent the removal performance of the wlr was stable whereas the irr showed a progressive increase of up to 700 mgcod l 1 in the effluent partly explained by an increase in vfa cod fig s6 the tn removal performance increased with increasing influent tn up to 785 mg l 1 during period iii fig 2b and effluent tn concentrations remained similar to that observed in periods i and ii this increased n removal was likely achieved by retaining organically bound n in the sludge however tn effluent concentrations decreased during period iv despite increased cod influent concentrations during this period also indicating assimilative n removal average n removal was not significantly different between periods iii and v however the main nitrogen species in treated effluent from the wlr was nitrate as opposed to ammonium in the irr effluent fig s7 suggesting that fundamentally different n removal pathways were giving similar removal performance excess nitrification also caused the tn efficiency drop in the wlr around day 140 which resulted from a programmable logic controller interruption stopping the influent pump but not the air supply total phosphorus removal was not affected by the hrt change period i and ii the tp increase in the influent during period iii translated into a higher tp concentration in the effluent fig s1 however tp concentration in the effluent decreased during period iv despite higher cod influent concentrations thought to be due to assimilative tp removal as described for tn above overall discharge limits to e g surface waters were not achieved in the one step treatment but depending on legislation the application as irrigation water might be feasible 3 2 cod n and p recovery mass balance over 124 days of operation for the wlr showed that a major fraction of the cod was lost 64 1 6 likely dissipated via respiration to co2 at the same time 25 1 4 of the nitrogen n was lost probably by stripping of ammonia or nitrification denitrification garcía et al 2000 mass balances for phosphorus p and potassium k indicated closure at 103 4 0 4 and 107 1 8 0 overall 32 7 2 0 of cod 36 2 0 7 of n and 28 6 0 4 of p in the influent was assimilated retained as biomass product in the wlr with the irr the recovery of tcod via vfas cod to biomass of 48 7 1 0 n 45 7 2 0 and p 44 3 0 was higher than in the wlr overall n and k balances on the irr also showed reasonable closure at 100 7 1 2 and 97 9 1 9 respectively off gas production irr measured a gas flow tipping bucket gas meter of around 1 2 l over the entire reactor operation with minor amounts of methane 2 9 ch4 2 8 co2 standard deviation of 1 5 on both and negligible hydrogen 0 01 this represents a negligible cod loss through methanogenesis a significant proportion of p was lost with only 80 4 0 of the influent load being recovered in effluent or sludge this loss of p is likely due to p precipitation with ca and mg and settling of precipitates to the bottom of the reactor despite the vigorous gas mixing applied during the tests partly caused by the elevated ph detailed progressive cumulative tcod n and p mass balances are presented in the supplementary materials figs s8 and s9 for reference 3 3 biomass characteristics the biomass characteristics of both reactors were well in line with literature values reported by shipman et al 1975 ppb and anupama and ravindra 2000 microalgae as well as a more recent comparison between microalgae fungi bacteria and ppb puyol et al 2016 biomass characteristics were affected by the influent composition of each operation period however comparing the crude protein calculated from particulate tkn content of periods i and ii over 143 d shows that both reactors generated biomass with 0 6 gcrude protein cp gts 1 compared to 0 6 0 65 and 0 45 0 65 gcp gts 1 puyol et al 2016 with average biomass yields for the irr and the wlr of 0 5 0 1 gcod gcod 1 and 0 3 0 2 gcod gcod 1 extracted from tcod sludge fractions in fig 4 the average biomass yield of the irr was up to 60 higher than that of the wlr at the same time the n and p content and tcod vs ratios of the biomass were essentially the same for both reactors 1 4 p and 10 n and 1 5 0 1 tcod vs data not shown the total protein content according to the amino acid analysis was higher in the irr biomass 460 mg amino acid gts 1 or 502 mg gvs 1 than in the wlr biomass 380 mg gts 1 or 390 mg gvs 1 also well in line with above cited literature fig 5 amino acid composition was only considered during period i and ii n 5 because particulate matter and increased crude protein cp content in higher strength influent wastewater of later operating periods the cp influent concentration during these periods increased to 3 4 g l 1 which means at least part of this protein is measured together with the ppb protein in the reactor anaerobic protein hydrolysis and fermentation to vfa co2 and nh4 n is commonly not complete due to thermodynamic stoichiometric ramsay and pullammanappallil 2001 and kinetic effects christ et al 2000 when harvesting the reactor biomass the total protein measurements also contained poultry processing wastewater proteins that are naturally parts of the solids this potentially interfered with the ppb protein profile during period ii and iv this would need to be considered if microbial protein were the goal with waste chicken fraction being acceptable e g for fish feed samocha et al 2004 or better solids removal would be required metal contaminants were also tested and were generally low with cd ni and as being undetectable 0 00 mg kg pb and cu being 0 4 mg kg and zn being 1 0 mg kg which would allow the global application as fertilizer and animal feed in china and canada following the limits values summarised by wang et al 2017 there were no systematic differences between the two products this offers no barriers to application of the final product as feed or fertilizer further information is provided in table s2 3 4 microbial analysis the microbial analysis of the wlr showed that photosynthetic organisms were present over the reactor operation period but did not dominate fig 6 the highest relative abundance of phototrophic organisms was 20 93 d with chlorella being the most abundant genus 16 at 93 d a variety of cyanobacteria chorophyta green non sulfur chloroflexi green sulfur chlorobi and purple phototrophic bacteria blastochloris rhodobacter rubivax thiocapsa were present as flanking phototrophs at less than 3 relative abundance the flanking ppb can act as aerobic anoxygenic phototrophs yurkov and beatty 1998 contributing to cod and nitrogen removal at high dissolved oxygen previously reported lu et al 2017 the wlr non phototrophic community was generally comprised of common facultative aerobic heterotrophs frequently detected in aerobic systems including comamonadaceae acidovorax hydrogenphaga schlegelella xanthobacteraceae xanthobacter dokdonella 4 12 relative abundance chitinophagaceae 0 17 38 and ellin6075 0 04 3 cao et al 2014 oren 2014 rosenberg 2014 but shifted over time this distribution also explains the neutral ph of the wlr were algae consumed inorganic carbon originating from organic carbon conversion by heterotrophs the shannon evenness index e was stable around 0 67 indicating very small changes of the diversity in the wlr community over time this indicates white light did not create a selection advantage for microalgae which would have resulted in dominance and a subsequent decreased equitability over time in contrast to the wlr the evenness index for the irr decreased from 0 6 to 0 4 in the irr over time fig 6 this indicates reduced diversity due to increased dominance of ppb driven by ir in combination with increased influent cod which also resulted in increased vfa cod concentrations in the reactor 200 mg vfa cod l 1 as show in fig s6 the vfa cod reactor concentration had significant effect of the relative abundances of ppb over time p 0 022 the most abundant ppb species was rhodopseudomonas palustris up to 50 followed by rhodobacter sphaeroides up to 23 and a variety of flanking ppbs including rubrivivax sp rhodocyclus sp blastochloris sp allochromatium and thiocapsa sp each max 1 0 the community shifted towards ppb dominance whereby changing influent conditions and particularly high influent cod period iv day 201 favoured rps palustris at day 201 the flanking community was comprised of a diverse mix of common representatives in anaerobic digesters including a variety of bacteroidetes dysgonomonas 10 7 201 d proteobacteria moraxellaceae 11 168 d and firmicutes carnobacterium 8 6 159 d that degrade oligomers such as fats carbohydrates and proteins into smaller subunits such as vfas and nh4 n wang et al 2014 utilized by ppbs to produce protein rich biomass interestingly methanogens specifically fast growing hydrogenotrophs did not become established and were present at low relative abundance of 3 0 at day 168 and generally below 1 0 aligning with the minimal methane production observed 3 5 comparing wl and ir reactors performance both bioreactor systems were able to simultaneously remove organic matter n and p from poultry processing wastewater at reasonable loading rates average 4 0 kg m 3 d 1 and reasonable hrt 1 0 d the comparison showed similar overall removal performance by the two reactors with 42 less effective irradiance in the irr comparing 18 w m 2 with 31 w m 2 par when considering emitted illumination the savings increases to 90 comparing ir irradiance 18 w m 2 with a full spectra 170 wm 2 we acknowledge that efficient uv vis leds would more efficiently deliver the same par output but will never approach the efficiency of ir illumination for artificial illumination we further note light attenuation is strongly impacted by biomass concentration and wavelength white light is not attenuated in pure water over 50 mm while ir light is attenuated by 20 fig s10 however even at 0 2 gvss l 1 ir light is less attenuated than wl 90 over 50 mm for ir vs 95 for wl penetration depth for both in the presence of biomass is comparably small being 5 mm for wl at 2 0 gvss l 1 vs 10 mm for ir this emphasises the importance of mixing and hydrodynamics in delivering the microorganisms to the irradiated surface as opposed to delivering photons to the microorganisms bitog et al 2011 microbial community and yield as expected in the wlr aerobic microalgae were not the main mediator for wastewater treatment and biomass assimilation hülsen et al 2018 this contrasts with previous reports where similar intensities to the 30 w m 2 par were able to support non photo inhibited microalgae nannochloropsis chlorella spirulina growth even at peak growth rates sforza et al 2012 simionato et al 2013 gouveia and oliveira 2009 the applied srt was above the minimum for rhodobacter sphaeroides chlorella sorokiniana and spirulina platensis ogbonna et al 2000 this is further supported by specific growth rates of chlorella sorokiniana and leptolyngbya 0 32 d 1on glucose wan et al 2011 or 0 24 0 27 on bicarbonate janssen et al 1999 0 40 d 1 on co2 van der grinten et al 2005 the key difference is likely due to two factors i the air supplied through membrane scouring and mixing and ii the complex wastewater source therefore treatment of this type of wastewater always results in albazod referring to the diverse community of algae bacteria zooplankton and detritus hargreaves 2006 population shifts in open microalgal ponds due to grazing and population losses are density depended whether fed with wastewater or pure substrates day 2013 and observed in pilot and large scale ponds in a sophisticated 10 year study in singapore taiganides 1992 this mixed bacterial dominated community of the wlr resulted in a similar yield 0 34 0 01 gcod gcod 1 compared to yields obtained in conventional aerobic systems which have up to 20 d srt at 20 c 0 3 0 4 gcod gcod 1 tchobanoglous et al 2003 as well as high rate activated systems with srt of 2 d jimenez et al 2015 in contrast the measured yields for the irr 0 5 0 01 gcod gcod 1 fell within in the broad range of values reported in the literature for mostly axenic ppb cultures treating various agri industrial wastewaters tuna condensate shrimp blanching water 0 24 prasertsan et al 1993 mandarin orange peel 0 83 sasaki et al 1991 and sago starch processing decanter 0 59 gcod gcod 1 getha et al 1998 the measured yields were lower than that reported for a mixed ppb community treating domestic wastewater 1 0 gcod gcod 1 hülsen et al 2016a which is likely attributed to the decreased relative ppb abundance 50 compared to 80 induced by high poultry wastewater influent cod and the need of e g fermenting bacteria to transform the oligomers into vfas despite the anaerobic conditions anaerobic protozoa can also graze and pose a potential threat to ppbs schulz et al 1990 and further research is required to clarify these effects for large scale production systems amino acid profile in comparison with fishmeal fao 1970 the overall protein level and hence amino acid content was lower in both reactors based on a crude protein content of 60 around 190 kg irr and 140 kg wlr of crude protein could be recovered per tonne of influent cod per day from poultry processing wastewater calculated following eq 3 the influence of non degraded influent protein on the biomass characteristics could be reduced by buffering to avoid peak loads which would also allow for a degree of pre acidification in terms of the single cell protein scp quality a stable microbial community is advantageous as product quality consistency and therefore potential value are likely improved as such ppb can produce a more consistent product when treating organic rich wastewaters because of the dominance by ppb as compared to an albazod based system however for the overall biomass protein content and recovery this would be secondary because protein residues already present in the raw wastewater could contribute to the harvested product we note that e g in the european union eu 2002 high grade feed mixtures are downgraded to lower categories if co mixed animal by products e g scp produced on wastewater have a low grade woodgate and van der veen 2004 which likely impacts the scp value but does not prohibit the application in general in terms of price this may lead to a preference for non animal derived wastewaters e g sugar mill stillage and these aspects require further clarification however we note that e g sugar mill wastewater also has drawbacks as it a does not contain sufficient macro and micronutrients b production is seasonal and c wastewater is recycled within the process throughout the production season personal communication with the management of the condong sugar mill australia and stream inventory campaign data not shown 3 6 significance for agricultural industrial wastewater

limits however the results did show that with sufficient influent cod significant amounts of n and p can be assimilated at average volumetric loads of 4 0 3 1 kgtcod m3 d 0 3 0 19 kgtn m 3 d 1 and 0 03 0 01 kgtp m 3 d 1 instead of producing low value biogas and operating at low biomass yields without nutrient recovery an scp concept could increase microbial yields as well as upgrade nutrients to valuable products rather than aiming to reduce sludge production as in traditional wastewater treatment a scp concept aims for maximum recovery of cod n and p which are then considered to be valuable resources there is an increasing interest in value add products and the upgrading of e g low value methane strong et al 2016 in this context burgess et al 2015 has determined that on a mass load basis from domestic wastewater input loads the value of microbial biomass is approximately 3 times that of biogas however this applied a relatively low value of aud 0 2 kg 1 to microbial biomass the results showed that irr has the potential to produce around 500 kg of protein rich biomass cod per tonne of influent cod assuming the presence of adequate amounts of n and p this achieves a significantly larger recoverable fraction in the wastewater treatment as compared to conventional anaerobic methanogenic technologies although the amino acid content of the recovered product was lower than fishmeal the data suggested that at least a fraction of fishmeal could be substituted with the biomass product where the value of fishmeal is between 1400 and 1800 usd tonne 1 asche et al 2013 which would result in 10 times higher values compared to biogas following burgess et al 2015 ultimately the value of the biomass has to be determined in feed trials but the relevant literature has already suggested the general applicability of phototrophic bacteria grown in axenic cultures on artificial medium banerjee et al 2000 azad et al 2002 kim and lee 2000 however for axenic cultures grown on artificial medium the production costs would likely exceed the product value and render the protein source economical unfeasible except for exceptionally high value niche applications this has been addressed for microalgae and biofuel production slade and bauen 2013 where the utilisation of wastewater has the potential to reduces the overall production costs park et al 2011 we note axenic cultures are not considered to be directly applicable to wastewater treatment and comparisons and life cycle analysis for ppb biomass are not available in the literature yet the irr could produce a ppb dominated culture with irradiance reduced to 8 0 kwh m 3 18 w m 2 at 18 m2 m 3 based on a volumetric removal rate of up to 3 6 kgcod m 3 d 1 90 cod removal and a yield of 0 5 kgcod kgcod 1 with 1 6 gtcod gvs 1 the net radiation energy required would then be around 7 kwh per dry tonne 25 gj in this case one tonne of ppb contains up to 22 2 gj chemical energy largely sourced from input cod based on 3 86 kwh kgcod 1 mccarty et al 2011 the potential product value in conjunction with the production costs will determine the future payback period and real world applications of a scp mediated system such as ppb technology in parallel resource recovery will become an economic driver in cyclic wastewater treatment and new technologies will be required in place of conventional cradle to grave solutions matassa et al 2015 4 conclusion the comparison of the irr ppb and the wlr albazod showed that both systems removed around 90 cod 90 tn and 40 tp although the underlying processes were fundamentally different the anaerobic ppb reactor outperformed the aerobic system in terms of organics and nutrients assimilation and potential resource recovery as protein rich biomass the biomass of both systems might serve as a future feed or feed additive where the irr was clearly dominated by ppb 55 compared to 20 of microalgae in the wlr which can result in more consistent product quality and value over time wlr systems may be more effective where natural light is preferred or where nutrient removal is more important than resource recovery acknowledgments we gratefully acknowledge dr

19398,to develop reactive and antifouling membrane filtration systems a photo fenton ceramic membrane was prepared by coating goethite α feooh catalysts on a zirconia titania alumina membrane via a cross linking method scanning electron microscopy sem x ray diffraction spectroscopy xrd and fourier transform infrared spectroscopy ftir were used to characterize α feooh catalysts and the surface coating quality the cross linker yielded stable covalent binding between catalyst and membrane under room temperature and produced a homogeneous and smooth coating of catalyst on ceramic membranes photo fenton reactions were initiated with addition of h2o2 under uv irradiation to improve the foulant degradation on membrane surface while filtration membrane fouling was simulated by bovine serum albumin bsa and humic acid ha our results show that the photo fenton reactions on the coated membranes slowed down the fouling kinetics and even reversed the fouling leading to a stable transmembrane pressure tmp over time of filtration as opposed to a monotonous increase of tmp due to surface fouling the batch experiments verified that the photo fenton reactions achieved the degradation rates of 76 and 86 for ha and bsa respectively within 60 min with the mineralization rates of over 80 as indicated by the total organic carbon measurement this study embarks on a novel antifouling membrane filtration process via incorporation of photo fenton reactions the findings are also important for diverse applications of surface fouling mitigation and rationale design of fouling resistant surfaces

fouling is caused by specific or non specific interactions between foulants and membrane surface which not only affects the quality and quantity of filtered water but also shortens membrane s life especially when irreversible fouling occurs luo et al 2017 wu et al 2018 zhang et al 2016a development of antifouling membranes is a popular approach to mitigate the impacts from surface fouling hamid et al 2017 jhaveri and murthy 2016 for example placing microsieves on top of membrane filters increasing membrane surface hydrophilicity via coating and grafting altering surface charge or decreasing surface roughness via plasma treatment were widely seen to reduce membrane fouling wavhal and fisher 2005 gironès i nogué et al 2006 nielsen et al 2016 ceramic membranes owing to their strong chemical

ceramic membranes could be tailored to vary surface hydrophobicity surface charge and surface reactivity lu et al 2016 kujawa et al 2017 ghadimkhani et al 2016 for example photocatalytic electrocatalytic and fenton like ceramic membranes were reported to remove water contaminants ranging from organic pollutants to colloids or pathogens dickhout et al 2017 surface functionalized ceramic membranes not only offer on demand reactivity for various applications but also render improved membrane longevity stability and a high resistance to chemical or photo corrosion integrating

tio2 membrane did not have obvious decrease in permeation flux after 10 h dynamic filtration under uv light without uv irradiation the permeation flux of the membrane decreased to 50 after 10 h zhang et al 2009 the objective of this present study is to prepare photo fenton reactive ceramic membranes and assess the antifouling and defouling performances while filtration traditional homogenous fenton processes are usually sustained under low and narrow phs 2 3 and require continuous supply of chemicals such as fe2 thereby causing iron sludge disposal issues oturan and aaron 2014 thus heterogeneous fenton like reactions are incorporated into our reactive membrane fabrication to tackle these issues e g acidification and neutralization of treated water in addition to achieving antifouling filtration li et al 2015 moreover compared to traditional uv tio2 photocatalysis photo fenton reactions can potentially be driven by both uv and visible light as stimulating energy sources

method liu et al 2010 as showed in fig s1 in the supporting information si 250 ml of a 0 5 mol l 1 fe no3 3 solution was slowly titrated with a 2 5 mol l 1 naoh solution at a constant rate of 5 ml min

cooled at room temperature the precipitate was centrifuged and washed repeatedly with di water finally the obtained solid was vacuum dried at 60 c for 2 h the synthesized particles have a length of approximately 400 500 nm and the width is about 25 50 nm as we reported recently zhang et al 2016b 2 3 preparation of α feooh coated ceramic membrane a flat sheet ceramic membrane sterlitech corporation us was used as a base support for catalytic functionalization the planar membrane is made of a zirconia titania zr tio2 coating on an alumina α al2o3 have a nominal pore size of 0 14 μm with an effective surface area of 17 34 cm2 the zr tio2 coating layers are inert to most corrosive chemicals solvents and extreme ph conditions bis 3 triethoxysilyl propyl tetrasulfide 22 3 w w in water was used as a silane binder solution alventosa delara et al 2014 30 mg α feooh particles were added in this silane solution 5 6 w w and ultrasonicated for 10 min the ceramic membrane with one side covered by the tape was soaked into the suspension for 20 min and then dried with nitrogen gas at 100 c for 1 h to vary the coating quality such as the coating or packing density porosity and binding strength we may change the catalyst suspension concentration and catalyst membrane exposure time followed by rigorous examinations of sem xrd eds and filtration tests the coating procedure adopted in this study was chosen based on a series of optimization tests which yielded the desirable performance of filtration flux and catalytic activity 2 4 physicochemical characterization the crystallinity of the goethite catalysts was determined by x ray diffraction xrd on a diffractometer x pert pro thermo panalytical holland equipped with cu kα radiation λ 1 5406 å 40 kv 40 ma in the 2θ

edx fei quanta 200 operating at 5 kv at a working distance of 6 mm surface compositions and crystalline phases were assessed by fourier transform infrared ftir ftir was performed on a nicolet thermo electron ftir spectrometer combined with a miracle attenuated total reflectance atr platform assembly and a ge plate zeta potentials of catalyst particles and surface zeta potentials of prepared membranes will be determined using dynamic light scattering dls on a zeta sizer nano zs instrument malvern zeta nanos zeta potential measurements for catalyst particles are based on electrophoresis by contrast surface zeta potential of ceramic membranes was measured in a surface zeta potential cell equipped on the malvern dls as we reported previously fu et al 2017 the cell will be placed in a cuvette filled with the dispersant e g 1 mm nacl solution within the ph range 4 11 and tracer particles 300 nm carboxylated latex tracer an electric field will be applied to the cell electrode and the subsequent motion of tracer particles within the electrolyte will be detected by measuring the electrophoretic mobility of the tracer particles at varying distances from the planar surface of membrane samples the magnitude of the particle electrophoresis and the electro osmosis generated by the surface zeta potential can be used to derive the surface zeta potential at the wall surface using the henry s equation 2 5 filtration experiment the permeate flux separation and fouling tests of the goethite embedded filtration membranes are carried out in a dead end cell with a membrane surface area of approximately 17 34 cm2 with the height of the 0 2 cm and a quartz cap with the area of 1 77 cm2 allowing sufficient uv light illumination of 401 μw w cm 2 fig 1 while not causing the overheating of membrane or influent water the uv lamp uvl 214 watt lamp analytikjena company has a peak wavelength at 365 nm different flow rates 1 25 ml min 1 which corresponds to the flux of 34 6 865 lmh were provided by a peristaltic pump catalog no 7553 20 cole parmer instrument company 2 5 1 clean water test the clean water tests were performed at room temperature on modified ceramic membranes with variations in thickness or porosity to determine the flux profiles versus tmp 15 35 psi meanwhile the corresponding r m can be solved which may vary with thickness or porosity 2 5 2 filtration performance for simulated polluted water different from the clean water test there were two influent input that provided simulated polluted water influent a and the h2o2 solution influent b as shown in fig 1 the two feed solutions were pumped separately with the same flow rate the total feed flow rate 3 68 0 3 ml min 1 into the membrane module to achieve the required concentrations of pollutants 35 mg l 1 bsa and 25 mg l 1 ha and the required dosage of h2o2 10 mm as commonly used previously liang et al 2014 the removal rates of ha and bsa were assessed by measuring their concentrations in the influent and effluent the concentrations of bsa and ha solutions were determined by uv absorbance measurement at 287 nm and 254 nm respectively using a uv vis spectrophotometer evolution 201 thermo scientific waltham ma usa xie et al 2013 2 6 membrane cleaning and reuse the chemical cleaning for the fouled ceramic membrane followed the three procedures 1 wash membrane with a 15 20 g l 1 naoh solution at 80 c for 30 min 2 wash membrane with a solution of 75 phosphoric acid h3po4 at 50 c for 15 min 3 rinse the ceramic membrane with di water repeatedly the catalyst coating on the ceramic membrane remained well after each rinse as indicated by the stable yellow color on the surface of the coated ceramic membrane as shown in fig 3a 3 result and discussion 3 1 characterization of synthesized α feooh catalyst sem images in fig 2 a revealed the needle like or rod shape as reported in literature sahu et al 2016 the length of the catalyst ranges from 500 to 550 nm the width is about 25 50 nm which is close to the measured hydrodynamic diameter 523 27 nm in fig 2b the xrd in fig 2c shows the major peaks at 21 2 29 36 7 53 and 59 2θ which correspond to crystallographic planes 110 120 111 and 221 of the pure goethite pattern li et al 2015 jiang et al 2016 fig 2d shows the uv vis diffuse reflectance absorption spectrum of the catalyst suspension in water according to the kubelkae munk function the band gap was determined from the plot αhν 2 versus the energy of exciting light hν which is shown as an inset in fig 2d here α is the absorption coefficient and hν is the photon energy based on linear extrapolation dotted lines the band gaps of α feooh was determined to be approximately 2 5 ev corresponding to the wavelength of 496 nm which confirms the α feooh catalyst could effectively absorb uv irradiation and even visible light responsive amani ghadim et al 2015 zhang et al 2011 3 2 characterization of α feooh coated ceramic membrane fig 3 shows the photos and sem images of pristine white in color and α feooh coated yellow ceramic membranes the sem images shows that the unmodified membrane had porous surfaces with particles of over 2 μm the α feooh coated membranes was covered by the rod shaped catalyst eds data verified the presence of elements ti and o without al probably because the tio2 coating layer was on top of the support base material of al2o3 which was not detected by eds the coating of α feooh catalyst was also verified as fe element was detected on coated membranes fig 4 shows that the major xrd peaks of goethite catalyst unmodified and modified ceramic membranes the peaks of 006 and 018 peaks in the red dotted line confirm the existence of γ al2o3 on unmodified ceramic membrane the xrd peaks at 110 104 121 200 and 116 match with jcpds pdf file no 21 1272 for anatase tio2 which indicates the presence of tio2 on the ceramic membrane the symbols on the blue curve of the modified ceramic membrane denotes the major peaks of α feooh γ al2o3 and tio2 besides ftir spectra of the α feooh coating on the ceramic membrane fig s4 also indicated the presence of a broad band at 3152 cm 1 due to o h stretching vibrations frost et al 2005 besides there are also important diagnostic o h bending bands 890 fe oh and 793 fe oh cm 1 as reported in literature oliveira et al 2008 3 3 permeate flux evaluation on ceramic membranes with without α feooh coating fig 5 shows the clean water flux under various tmps for ceramic membranes before and after catalyst coating α feooh coating layer is expected to be mesoporous with large specific surface areas which maintains permeability and provides photocatalytic reaction sites the fluxes for coated membranes were both lower than the unmodified ceramic membranes because the silane binder and α feooh catalyst on the membrane surface blocked some pores of the ceramic membranes from fig 5 the clean water permeability for the pristine ceramic membranes are determined to be more than 42 0 lmh psi 1 for the ones with nominal pore sizes of 0 14 μm for coated membranes the clean water permeability changed to 30 1 lmh psi 1 indicating that the membrane pore blocking by catalyst particles was not detrimental according to the kozeny and carman equation carman 1997 the porosity ε and pore size dh of catalyst coating layers are proportional to catalyst particle diameter 500 550 nm thus the interstices between catalyst particles create porous structures and allow for flux permeation the permeate flux commonly expressed in units of liters per m2 of membrane per hour l m 2 h 1 lmh can be calculated by the darcy s equation in eq 1 1 j w v a t δ p u r m r f t m p u r m r f p f p p u r m r f where j is the permeate flux lmh v is the permeate volume l a is the effective surface area of the membranes m2 and t is the time of the permeate collection h δp is the trans membrane pressures tmp which is the difference of the hydraulic pressure in the feed stream pf and the hydraulic pressure in permeate stream pp pf was monitored by a pressure gauge pem lf series winters while pp was equal to the atmospheric pressure μ is the dynamic viscosity of water at 25 c 0 8937 10 3 n s m 2 r m is the background membrane resistance and r f is the fouling layer resistance which contribute to the total membrane hydraulic resistance for clean water tests r f 0 the inherent membrane resistance r m for the pristine ceramic membranes was 0 8 1010 m 1 with the catalyst coating the values of r m increased to 2 74 1010 m 1 previously guo et al reported the membrane resistance increased with coating tio2 zro2 which agrees with our findings guo et al 2018 3 4 fouling and defouling kinetics under a constant tmp as shown in fig s5 the preliminary experiments of bsa filtration with catalysts coated ceramic membranes showed that the addition of h2o2 and uv irradiation controlled the flux decrease rate substantially in the control group without h2o2 or uv the flux decreased to be almost 0 in 50 min it is reported that the α feooh coating is expected to promote heterogeneous fenton reactions in the presence of h2o2 and uv irradiation zhang et al 2016b the surface deposited bsa may undergo uv photolysis and photocatalytic degradation by the generated hydroxyl radicals oh fig 6 shows the flux changes during filtration of bsa containing water at a constant tmp 24 5 psi the flux decreased sharply at the initial 7 min without uv irradiation and addition of h2o2 after applying the uv irradiation from 7 to 37 min the flux decline rate was apparently reduced from 4 3 to 0 3 lmh min 1 because of photolysis of bsa under uv irradiation that may slow down the bsa deposition and membrane fouling processes at the 37 min h2o2 was added to the system which significantly reduce the flux decline rate further to be as low as 0 2 lmh min 1 our speculation is that the photo fenton reaction on the α feooh coating was not effectively sustained due to the accumulation of the bsa layer on the membrane surface as the ceramic membrane fouled quickly under a high bsa concentration 350 mg l 1 a low feed concentration of bsa 35 mg l 1 and a low tmp 10 psi was applied with addition of h2o2 first followed by the uv h2o2 to evaluate any different impacts on fouling mitigation the flux decreased slowly at the first 30 min at a lower fouling rate 30 lmh min 1 after adding h2o2 at 30 min the flux continued to decline until reaching a complete zero however the flux recovered to around 80 lmh after consecutive addition of h2o2 which means supplying h2o2 to the filtration system could somewhat remove fouling and produce a minor defouling process with the uv irradiation at 80 min the flux began to stabilize at around 50 lmh without further fouling the flux was completely recovered to 220 lmh after chemical flush which is equal to the clean water flux on the covalent bound coated membrane the chemical flush or cleaning involved the use of sodium hydroxide and phosphoric acid which appeared to effectively remove ha or bsa foulants the catalyst coating remained stable and active after several filtration cleaning cycles fig s6 no observable damage to the membrane or coating was detected through the permeability measurements and microscopic investigations of the surface morphology 3 5 fouling and defouling kinetics under a constant permeate flux fig 7 a shows that the tmp changes during the filtration of bsa under the constant permeate flux and different photochemical conditions the tmp increased with the filtration time almost linearly for all the four situations due to apparent membrane fouling adding h2o2 into the filtration system did not slow down fouling kinetics on the contrary after 90 min the tmp for the filtration with constant addition of h2o2 increased faster than that when only the bsa solution was filtered through the comparison of red dot and green triangle data this enhanced fouling kinetics is probably caused by the bsa oxidation by h2o2 which produced small fragments of bsa degradation byproducts and led to faster membrane pore blocking monash and pugazhenthi 2011 owing to the photo fenton reaction the constant exposure to uv irradiation and h2o2 apparently slowed down and delayed the membrane fouling blue triangle data after 90 min the tmp increase appeared to reach a plateau level at around 7 psi moreover the photo fenton reaction on the ceramic membrane also demonstrated the pronounced effects on the defouling process at 90 min the uv irradiation and the h2o2 were simultaneously provided to the filtration of the bsa which caused the tmp increase from 5 to 8 psi as evidenced from the hollow data points the tmp decreased sharply after the first 10 min of uv h2o2 exposure and then reached a steady state of 7 psi after 110 min which coincided with the plateau level of the filtration system with constant exposure to uv h2o2 similarly we conducted filtration tests using ha as another model foulant to verify the antifouling and defouling effects of α feooh coated ceramic membranes as shown in fig 7b the tmp remained stable around 4 5 psi when filtering the di water the tmp levels substantially increased when filtering the ha solution w o adding h2o2 however the constant treatment by uv h2o2 slightly inhibited fouling and led to a stable tmp around 9 5 psi the fouling control or mitigation is primarily attributed to the degradation of surface foulants via the photo fenton reactions on ceramic membrane surface the model foulants bsa and ha used in our current study should primarily deposit on the ceramic membrane surface due to the size exclusion effect which lead to complete blocking fouling to verify this fouling mechanism we conducted the blocking model analysis according to the following equation hermia 1982 liu et al 2017b ho and zydney 2000 2 n d log d 2 t d v 2 d log d t d v where t is the filtration time and v is the accumulative permeate volume the exponent n was analytically evaluated by differentiating the logarithm of d t d v with respect to the logarithm of d t d v the exponent n characterizes the filtration mechanisms for instance if n 0 the fouling is primarily due to cake layer formation n 1 for intermediate blocking n 1 5 for standard blocking and n 2 for complete pore blocking fig s7a shows our result of accumulative permeate volume over time of filtration for bsa with which we computed the log d 2 t d v 2 and log d t d v and plotted them in fig s7b the curve fitting shows that the n value is 2 96 which indicates the membrane may undergo complete pore blocking as illustrated in fig s8a in the complete blocking law foulant primarily deposit on membrane surface and block pore completely causing reversible fouling by contrast the pore blocking usually induces irreversible fouling which is not the dominant fouling mechanism in our study similar results were obtained for humic acids results are not shown here therefore it is plausible that the bsa or humic acid induced fouling on our membrane surface was efficiently removed via photo fenton reaction on the membrane surface and the permeate flux was recovered completely 3 6 degradation analysis of bsa and ha by the ceramic membrane coated with α feooh catalysts fig 8 a demonstrates a significantly degradation rate of bsa under uv h2o2 α feooh condition which led to approximately 90 of bsa degradation within 60 min by contrast the removal efficiencies reached up to 40 when bsa was exposed to α feooh with either uv irradiation or h2o2 there were negligible removal rates of bsa under exposure to only α feooh h2o2 or uv irradiation which highlighted the indispensable roles of photo fenton reactions in bsa degradation fig 8b compares the degradation rates of ha under different reaction conditions similar to bsa the combination of uv h2o2 α feooh led to the highest removal rate of ha approximately 80 within 60 min followed by only uv irradiation α feooh and h2o2 α feooh fig 9 a and b shows the toc removal of bsa and ha under various reaction conditions clearly the degradation rates of bsa and ha well align with their toc removal rates though the toc removal rates were sometimes higher or lower than degradation rates uv irradiation or h2o2 alone could also decompose bsa and ha from 20 to 40 in the presence of α feooh both the toc degradation by uv irradiation or h2o2 alone was significantly improved toc removal of bsa reached up to 60 while that of ha was about 50 however the toc removal of bsa and ha was both the highest above 80 within 60 min under the combination of uv h2o2 α feooh that ultimately enabled photo fenton reactions on catalyst surface as depicted in fig 9c α feooh catalysts deposited on ceramic membranes promote photo fenton reactions involving the generation of photoelectrons and holes in surface iron oxides scavenged by surface sites feiii oh to produce oh while allowing the redox pair of fe2 fe3 to recirculate this demonstrates that an α feooh h2o2 system can effectively oxidize pollutants at a neutral ph condition in eqs 3 6 3 f e ι ι ι o h h 2 o 2 f e ι ι ι o o h h 2 o 4 f e ι ι ι o

catalyst α feooh and integration on reactive ceramic membrane development were demonstrated the removal of bsa and ha reached 86 and 76 4 at the same conditions by the combination of uv h2o2 α feooh our major findings are 1 α feooh catalysts were successfully functionalized on ceramic membranes via cross linking under room temperature which avoided high temperature sintering and largely prevented potential changes of catalyst crystallinity and other catalytic activities 2 the α feooh coated ceramic membranes exhibited pronounced photo fenton reactivity that mitigated membrane fouling by bsa or ha as indicated by the stable transmembrane pressure tmp conversely without photo fenton reactions membrane fouling was evident as the tmp substantially increased during the filtration experiments the batch experiments compared the degradation and removal of bsa and ha under different conditions and confirmed that only the combination of uv h2o2 α feooh led to the highest rates of foulant removal owing to the sustained photo fenton reactions on the catalyst other single exposure to the uv irradiation h2o2 and α feooh could partially remove bsa or ha via photolysis chemical oxidation or adsorption overall this study aims to offer new insight into the development of next generation reactive membrane filtration systems that exhibit antifouling and pollutant degrading features the

19398,to develop reactive and antifouling membrane filtration systems a photo fenton ceramic membrane was prepared by coating goethite α feooh catalysts on a zirconia titania alumina membrane via a cross linking method scanning electron microscopy sem x ray diffraction spectroscopy xrd and fourier transform infrared spectroscopy ftir were used to characterize α feooh catalysts and the surface coating quality the cross linker yielded stable covalent binding between catalyst and membrane under room temperature and produced a homogeneous and smooth coating of catalyst on ceramic membranes photo fenton reactions were initiated with addition of h2o2 under uv irradiation to improve the foulant degradation on membrane surface while filtration membrane fouling was simulated by bovine serum albumin bsa and humic acid ha our results show that the photo fenton reactions on the coated membranes slowed down the fouling kinetics and even reversed the fouling leading to a stable transmembrane pressure tmp over time of filtration as opposed to a monotonous increase of tmp due to surface fouling the batch experiments verified that the photo fenton reactions achieved the degradation rates of 76 and 86 for ha and bsa respectively within 60 min with the mineralization rates of over 80 as indicated by the total organic carbon measurement this study embarks on a novel antifouling membrane filtration process via incorporation of photo fenton reactions the findings are also important for diverse applications of surface fouling mitigation and rationale design of fouling resistant surfaces

fouling is caused by specific or non specific interactions between foulants and membrane surface which not only affects the quality and quantity of filtered water but also shortens membrane s life especially when irreversible fouling occurs luo et al 2017 wu et al 2018 zhang et al 2016a development of antifouling membranes is a popular approach to mitigate the impacts from surface fouling hamid et al 2017 jhaveri and murthy 2016 for example placing microsieves on top of membrane filters increasing membrane surface hydrophilicity via coating and grafting altering surface charge or decreasing surface roughness via plasma treatment were widely seen to reduce membrane fouling wavhal and fisher 2005 gironès i nogué et al 2006 nielsen et al 2016 ceramic membranes owing to their strong chemical and thermal stability and relatively low operational transmembrane pressures are receiving more attention in water treatment water reuse reclamation and chemical separation processes shang et al 2017 niwa et al 2016 wei et al 2016 waszak and gryta 2016 ma et al 2017 the anti corrosion properties enable ceramic membranes to operate under extremely harsh chemical conditions e g acidic alkaline or high temperatures ma et al 2017 deibert et al 2017 moreover recent studies show ceramic membranes tubular or flat sheets can have smaller footprint and higher flux gao et al 2011 han et al 2015 ceramic membranes could be tailored to vary surface hydrophobicity surface charge and surface reactivity lu et al 2016 kujawa et al 2017 ghadimkhani et al 2016 for example photocatalytic electrocatalytic and fenton like ceramic membranes were reported to remove water contaminants ranging from organic pollutants to colloids or pathogens dickhout et al 2017 surface functionalized ceramic membranes not only offer on demand reactivity for various applications but also render improved membrane longevity stability and a high resistance to chemical or photo corrosion integrating

sodium alginate sa de angelis and de cortalezzi 2016 tio2 incorporated membranes have proven excellent antifouling properties yu et al 2017 during the filtration process of 10 mg l 1 humic acid the tio2 membrane did not have obvious decrease in permeation flux after 10 h dynamic filtration under uv light without uv irradiation the permeation flux of the membrane decreased to 50 after 10 h zhang et al 2009 the objective of this present study is to prepare photo fenton reactive ceramic membranes and assess the antifouling and defouling performances while filtration traditional homogenous fenton processes are usually sustained under low and narrow phs 2 3 and require continuous supply of chemicals such as fe2 thereby causing iron sludge disposal issues oturan and aaron 2014 thus heterogeneous fenton like reactions are incorporated into our reactive membrane fabrication to tackle these issues e g acidification and neutralization of treated water in addition to achieving antifouling filtration li et al 2015 moreover compared to traditional uv tio2 photocatalysis photo fenton reactions can potentially be driven by both uv and visible light as stimulating energy sources which may permit the use of solar energy and alternative light illumination e g such as flexible uv visible light led arrays or optical fibers for industrialized membrane filtration processes heterogeneous fenton like catalysts such as α feooh β feooh γ feooh fe2o3 fe3o4 fe fe3o4 bifeo3 znfe2o4 fe2 moo4 3 fe3 x cr x o4 and fe x v y o z commonly contain iron elements that can activate h2o2

method liu et al 2010 as showed in fig s1 in the supporting information si 250 ml of a 0 5 mol l 1 fe no3 3 solution was slowly titrated with a 2 5 mol l 1 naoh solution at a constant rate of 5 ml min

cooled at room temperature the precipitate was centrifuged and washed repeatedly with di water finally the obtained solid was vacuum dried at 60 c for 2 h the synthesized particles have a length of approximately 400 500 nm and the width is about 25 50 nm as we reported recently zhang et al 2016b 2 3 preparation of α feooh coated ceramic membrane a flat sheet ceramic membrane sterlitech corporation us was used as a base support for catalytic functionalization the planar membrane is made of a zirconia titania zr tio2 coating on an alumina α al2o3 have a nominal pore size of 0 14 μm with an effective surface area of 17 34 cm2 the zr tio2 coating layers are inert to most corrosive chemicals solvents and extreme ph conditions bis 3 triethoxysilyl propyl tetrasulfide 22 3 w w in water was used as a silane binder solution alventosa delara et al 2014 30 mg α feooh particles were added in this silane solution 5 6 w w and ultrasonicated for 10 min the ceramic membrane with one side covered by the tape was soaked into the suspension for 20 min and then dried with nitrogen gas at 100 c for 1 h to vary the coating quality such as the coating or packing density porosity and binding strength we may change the catalyst suspension concentration and catalyst membrane exposure time followed by rigorous examinations of sem xrd eds and filtration tests the coating procedure adopted in this study was chosen based on a series of optimization tests which yielded the desirable performance of filtration flux and catalytic activity 2 4 physicochemical characterization the crystallinity of the goethite catalysts was determined by x ray diffraction xrd on a diffractometer x pert pro thermo panalytical holland equipped with cu kα radiation λ 1 5406 å 40 kv 40 ma in the 2θ

edx fei quanta 200 operating at 5 kv at a working distance of 6 mm surface compositions and crystalline phases were assessed by fourier transform infrared ftir ftir was performed on a nicolet thermo electron ftir spectrometer combined with a miracle attenuated total reflectance atr platform assembly and a ge plate zeta potentials of catalyst particles and surface zeta potentials of prepared membranes will be determined using dynamic light scattering dls on a zeta sizer nano zs instrument malvern zeta nanos zeta potential measurements for catalyst particles are based on electrophoresis by contrast surface zeta potential of ceramic membranes was measured in a surface zeta potential cell equipped on the malvern dls as we reported previously fu et al 2017 the cell will be placed in a cuvette filled with the dispersant e g 1 mm nacl solution within the ph range 4 11 and tracer particles 300 nm carboxylated latex tracer an electric field will be applied to the cell electrode and the subsequent motion of tracer particles within the electrolyte will be detected by measuring the electrophoretic mobility of the tracer particles at varying distances from the planar surface of membrane samples the magnitude of the particle electrophoresis and the electro osmosis generated by the surface zeta potential can be used to derive the surface zeta potential at the wall surface using the henry s equation 2 5 filtration experiment the permeate flux separation and fouling tests of the goethite embedded filtration membranes are carried out in a dead end cell with a membrane surface area of approximately 17 34 cm2 with the height of the 0 2 cm and a quartz cap with the area of 1 77 cm2 allowing sufficient uv light illumination of 401 μw w cm 2 fig 1 while not causing the overheating of membrane or influent water the uv lamp uvl 214 watt lamp analytikjena company has a peak wavelength at 365 nm different flow rates 1 25 ml min 1 which corresponds to the flux of 34 6 865 lmh were provided by a peristaltic pump catalog no 7553 20 cole parmer instrument company 2 5 1 clean water test the clean water tests were performed at room temperature on modified ceramic membranes with variations in thickness or porosity to determine the flux profiles versus tmp 15 35 psi meanwhile the corresponding r m can be solved which may vary with thickness or porosity 2 5 2 filtration performance for simulated polluted water different from the clean water test there were two influent input that provided simulated polluted water influent a and the h2o2 solution influent b as shown in fig 1 the two feed solutions were pumped separately with the same flow rate the total feed flow rate 3 68 0 3 ml min 1 into the membrane module to achieve the required concentrations of pollutants 35 mg l 1 bsa and 25 mg l 1 ha and the required dosage of h2o2 10 mm as commonly used previously liang et al 2014 the removal rates of ha and bsa were assessed by measuring their concentrations in the influent and effluent the concentrations of bsa and ha solutions were determined by uv absorbance measurement at 287 nm and 254 nm respectively using a uv vis spectrophotometer evolution 201 thermo scientific waltham ma usa xie et al 2013 2 6 membrane cleaning and reuse the chemical cleaning for the fouled ceramic membrane followed the three procedures 1 wash membrane with a 15 20 g l 1 naoh solution at 80 c for 30 min 2 wash membrane with a solution of 75 phosphoric acid h3po4 at 50 c for 15 min 3 rinse the ceramic membrane with di water repeatedly the catalyst coating on the ceramic membrane remained well after each rinse as indicated by the stable yellow color on the surface of the coated ceramic membrane as shown in fig 3a 3 result and discussion 3 1 characterization of synthesized α feooh catalyst sem images in fig 2 a revealed the needle like or rod shape as reported in literature sahu et al 2016 the length of the catalyst ranges from 500 to 550 nm the width is about 25 50 nm which is close to the measured hydrodynamic diameter 523 27 nm in fig 2b the xrd in fig 2c shows the major peaks at 21 2 29 36 7 53 and 59 2θ which correspond to crystallographic planes 110 120 111 and 221 of the pure goethite pattern li et al 2015 jiang et al 2016 fig 2d shows the uv vis diffuse reflectance absorption spectrum of the catalyst suspension in water according to the kubelkae munk function the band gap was determined from the plot αhν 2 versus the energy of exciting light hν which is shown as an inset in fig 2d here α is the absorption coefficient and hν is the photon energy based on linear extrapolation dotted lines the band gaps of α feooh was determined to be approximately 2 5 ev corresponding to the wavelength of 496 nm which confirms the α feooh catalyst could effectively absorb uv irradiation and even visible light responsive amani ghadim et al 2015 zhang et al 2011 3 2 characterization of α feooh coated ceramic membrane fig 3 shows the photos and sem images of pristine white in color and α feooh coated yellow ceramic membranes the sem images shows that the unmodified membrane had porous surfaces with particles of over 2 μm the α feooh coated membranes was covered by the rod shaped catalyst eds data verified the presence of elements ti and o without al probably because the tio2 coating layer was on top of the support base material of al2o3 which was not detected by eds the coating of α feooh catalyst was also verified as fe element was detected on coated membranes fig 4 shows that the major xrd peaks of goethite catalyst unmodified and modified ceramic membranes the peaks of 006 and 018 peaks in the red dotted line confirm the existence of γ al2o3 on unmodified ceramic membrane the xrd peaks at 110 104 121 200 and 116 match with jcpds pdf file no 21 1272 for anatase tio2 which indicates the presence of tio2 on the ceramic membrane the symbols on the blue curve of the modified ceramic membrane denotes the major peaks of α feooh γ al2o3 and tio2 besides ftir spectra of the α feooh coating on the ceramic membrane fig s4 also indicated the presence of a broad band at 3152 cm 1 due to o h stretching vibrations frost et al 2005 besides there are also important diagnostic o h bending bands 890 fe oh and 793 fe oh cm 1 as reported in literature oliveira et al 2008 3 3 permeate flux evaluation on ceramic membranes with without α feooh coating fig 5 shows the clean water flux under various tmps for ceramic membranes before and after catalyst coating α feooh coating layer is expected to be mesoporous with large specific surface areas which maintains permeability and provides photocatalytic reaction sites the fluxes for coated membranes were both lower than the unmodified ceramic membranes because the silane binder and α feooh catalyst on the membrane surface blocked some pores of the ceramic membranes from fig 5 the clean water permeability for the pristine ceramic membranes are determined to be more than 42 0 lmh psi 1 for the ones with nominal pore sizes of 0 14 μm for coated membranes the clean water permeability changed to 30 1 lmh psi 1 indicating that the membrane pore blocking by catalyst particles was not detrimental according to the kozeny and carman equation carman 1997 the porosity ε and pore size dh of catalyst coating layers are proportional to catalyst particle diameter 500 550 nm thus the interstices between catalyst particles create porous structures and allow for flux permeation the permeate flux commonly expressed in units of liters per m2 of membrane per hour l m 2 h 1 lmh can be calculated by the darcy s equation in eq 1 1 j w v a t δ p u r m r f t m p u r m r f p f p p u r m r f where j is the permeate flux lmh v is the permeate volume l a is the effective surface area of the membranes m2 and t is the time of the permeate collection h δp is the trans membrane pressures tmp which is the difference of the hydraulic pressure in the feed stream pf and the hydraulic pressure in permeate stream pp pf was monitored by a pressure gauge pem lf series winters while pp was equal to the atmospheric pressure μ is the dynamic viscosity of water at 25 c 0 8937 10 3 n s m 2 r m is the background membrane resistance and r f is the fouling layer resistance which contribute to the total membrane hydraulic resistance for clean water tests r f 0 the inherent membrane resistance r m for the pristine ceramic membranes was 0 8 1010 m 1 with the catalyst coating the values of r m increased to 2 74 1010 m 1 previously guo et al reported the membrane resistance increased with coating tio2 zro2 which agrees with our findings guo et al 2018 3 4 fouling and defouling kinetics under a constant tmp as shown in fig s5 the preliminary experiments of bsa filtration with catalysts coated ceramic membranes showed that the addition of h2o2 and uv irradiation controlled the flux decrease rate substantially in the control group without h2o2 or uv the flux decreased to be almost 0 in 50 min it is reported that the α feooh coating is expected to promote heterogeneous fenton reactions in the presence of h2o2 and uv irradiation zhang et al 2016b the surface deposited bsa may undergo uv photolysis and photocatalytic degradation by the generated hydroxyl radicals oh fig 6 shows the flux changes during filtration of bsa containing water at a constant tmp 24 5 psi the flux decreased sharply at the initial 7 min without uv irradiation and addition of h2o2 after applying the uv irradiation from 7 to 37 min the flux decline rate was apparently reduced from 4 3 to 0 3 lmh min 1 because of photolysis of bsa under uv irradiation that may slow down the bsa deposition and membrane fouling processes at the 37 min h2o2 was added to the system which significantly reduce the flux decline rate further to be as low as 0 2 lmh min 1 our speculation is that the photo fenton reaction on the α feooh coating was not effectively sustained due to the accumulation of the bsa layer on the membrane surface as the ceramic membrane fouled quickly under a high bsa concentration 350 mg l 1 a low feed concentration of bsa 35 mg l 1 and a low tmp 10 psi was applied with addition of h2o2 first followed by the uv h2o2 to evaluate any different impacts on fouling mitigation the flux decreased slowly at the first 30 min at a lower fouling rate 30 lmh min 1 after adding h2o2 at 30 min the flux continued to decline until reaching a complete zero however the flux recovered to around 80 lmh after consecutive addition of h2o2 which means supplying h2o2 to the filtration system could somewhat remove fouling and produce a minor defouling process with the uv irradiation at 80 min the flux began to stabilize at around 50 lmh without further fouling the flux was completely recovered to 220 lmh after chemical flush which is equal to the clean water flux on the covalent bound coated membrane the chemical flush or cleaning involved the use of sodium hydroxide and phosphoric acid which appeared to effectively remove ha or bsa foulants the catalyst coating remained stable and active after several filtration cleaning cycles fig s6 no observable damage to the membrane or coating was detected through the permeability measurements and microscopic investigations of the surface morphology 3 5 fouling and defouling kinetics under a constant permeate flux fig 7 a shows that the tmp changes during the filtration of bsa under the constant permeate flux and different photochemical conditions the tmp increased with the filtration time almost linearly for all the four situations due to apparent membrane fouling adding h2o2 into the filtration system did not slow down fouling kinetics on the contrary after 90 min the tmp for the filtration with constant addition of h2o2 increased faster than that when only the bsa solution was filtered through the comparison of red dot and green triangle data this enhanced fouling kinetics is probably caused by the bsa oxidation by h2o2 which produced small fragments of bsa degradation byproducts and led to faster membrane pore blocking monash and pugazhenthi 2011 owing to the photo fenton reaction the constant exposure to uv irradiation and h2o2 apparently slowed down and delayed the membrane fouling blue triangle data after 90 min the tmp increase appeared to reach a plateau level at around 7 psi moreover the photo fenton reaction on the ceramic membrane also demonstrated the pronounced effects on the defouling process at 90 min the uv irradiation and the h2o2 were simultaneously provided to the filtration of the bsa which caused the tmp increase from 5 to 8 psi as evidenced from the hollow data points the tmp decreased sharply after the first 10 min of uv h2o2 exposure and then reached a steady state of 7 psi after 110 min which coincided with the plateau level of the filtration system with constant exposure to uv h2o2 similarly we conducted filtration tests using ha as another model foulant to verify the antifouling and defouling effects of α feooh coated ceramic membranes as shown in fig 7b the tmp remained stable around 4 5 psi when filtering the di water the tmp levels substantially increased when filtering the ha solution w o adding h2o2 however the constant treatment by uv h2o2 slightly inhibited fouling and led to a stable tmp around 9 5 psi the fouling control or mitigation is primarily attributed to the degradation of surface foulants via the photo fenton reactions on ceramic membrane surface the model foulants bsa and ha used in our current study should primarily deposit on the ceramic membrane surface due to the size exclusion effect which lead to complete blocking fouling to verify this fouling mechanism we conducted the blocking model analysis according to the following equation hermia 1982 liu et al 2017b ho and zydney 2000 2 n d log d 2 t d v 2 d log d t d v where t is the filtration time and v is the accumulative permeate volume the exponent n was analytically evaluated by differentiating the logarithm of d t d v with respect to the logarithm of d t d v the exponent n characterizes the filtration mechanisms for instance if n 0 the fouling is primarily due to cake layer formation n 1 for intermediate blocking n 1 5 for standard blocking and n 2 for complete pore blocking fig s7a shows our result of accumulative permeate volume over time of filtration for bsa with which we computed the log d 2 t d v 2 and log d t d v and plotted them in fig s7b the curve fitting shows that the n value is 2 96 which indicates the membrane may undergo complete pore blocking as illustrated in fig s8a in the complete blocking law foulant primarily deposit on membrane surface and block pore completely causing reversible fouling by contrast the pore blocking usually induces irreversible fouling which is not the dominant fouling mechanism in our study similar results were obtained for humic acids results are not shown here therefore it is plausible that the bsa or humic acid induced fouling on our membrane surface was efficiently removed via photo fenton reaction on the membrane surface and the permeate flux was recovered completely 3 6 degradation analysis of bsa and ha by the ceramic membrane coated with α feooh catalysts fig 8 a demonstrates a significantly degradation rate of bsa under uv h2o2 α feooh condition which led to approximately 90 of bsa degradation within 60 min by contrast the removal efficiencies reached up to 40 when bsa was exposed to α feooh with either uv irradiation or h2o2 there were negligible removal rates of bsa under exposure to only α feooh h2o2 or uv irradiation which highlighted the indispensable roles of photo fenton reactions in bsa degradation fig 8b compares the degradation rates of ha under different reaction conditions similar to bsa the combination of uv h2o2 α feooh led to the highest removal rate of ha approximately 80 within 60 min followed by only uv irradiation α feooh and h2o2 α feooh fig 9 a and b shows the toc removal of bsa and ha under various reaction conditions clearly the degradation rates of bsa and ha well align with their toc removal rates though the toc removal rates were sometimes higher or lower than degradation rates uv irradiation or h2o2 alone could also decompose bsa and ha from 20 to 40 in the presence of α feooh both the toc degradation by uv irradiation or h2o2 alone was significantly improved toc removal of bsa reached up to 60 while that of ha was about 50 however the toc removal of bsa and ha was both the highest above 80 within 60 min under the combination of uv h2o2 α feooh that ultimately enabled photo fenton reactions on catalyst surface as depicted in fig 9c α feooh catalysts deposited on ceramic membranes promote photo fenton reactions involving the generation of photoelectrons and holes in surface iron oxides scavenged by surface sites feiii oh to produce oh while allowing the redox pair of fe2 fe3 to recirculate this demonstrates that an α feooh h2o2 system can effectively oxidize pollutants at a neutral ph condition in eqs 3 6 3 f e ι ι ι o h h 2 o 2 f e ι ι ι o o h h 2 o 4 f e ι ι ι o

catalyst α feooh and integration on reactive ceramic membrane development were demonstrated the removal of bsa and ha reached 86 and 76 4 at the same conditions by the combination of uv h2o2 α feooh our major findings are 1 α feooh catalysts were successfully functionalized on ceramic membranes via cross linking under room temperature which avoided high temperature sintering and largely prevented potential changes of catalyst crystallinity and other catalytic activities 2 the α feooh coated ceramic membranes exhibited pronounced photo fenton reactivity that mitigated membrane fouling by bsa or ha as indicated by the stable transmembrane pressure tmp conversely without photo fenton reactions membrane fouling was evident as the tmp substantially increased during the filtration experiments the batch experiments compared the degradation and removal of bsa and ha under different conditions and confirmed that only the combination of uv h2o2 α feooh led to the highest rates of foulant removal owing to the sustained photo fenton reactions on the catalyst other single exposure to the uv irradiation h2o2 and α feooh could partially remove bsa or ha via photolysis chemical oxidation or adsorption overall this study aims to offer new insight into the development of next generation reactive membrane filtration systems that exhibit antifouling and pollutant degrading features the research findings are also important for broader engineering applications such as fouling resistant material design and fabrication for sustainable chemical processing water and wastewater treatment

and gschwend 2003 chiou et al 2015 cornelissen et al 2005 huang et al 2006 kuo et al 2007 lian and xing 2017 it has been generally accepted that bc exhibits far stronger sorption affinity for organic compounds than organic carbon in the environment it has been shown that small quantities of bc can influence sorption of organic contaminants in soils yang and shen 2003 james et al 2005 or sediments accardi dey and gschwend 2003 kuo et al 2007 significantly previous studies have indicated that the sorption capacity of bc may be 10 1000 times stronger than that of other natural organic matter for organic contaminants bucheli and gustafsson 2000 cornelissen et al 2005 this implies that bc can strongly influence the mobility and persistence of organic contaminants in soil and sediment environments via sorptive interaction enhanced sorption of various organic contaminants to other forms of condensed carbonaceous materials has also been reported for coal kleineidam et al 2002 charcoal yang and sheng 2003 and activated carbon matsui et al 2002 however considerable variability in sorption coefficients have been reported for various types of bc james et al 2005 reported a 3 orders of magnitude variation in apparent char sorption coefficients determined for phenanthrene with various natural and artificial wood char the study demonstrated that even with well defined and freshly prepared wood char sorption capacity varied with different starting materials and thermal conditions later hawthorne et al 1997 reported that log k bc i e black carbon normalized solid water sorption coefficient k bc k d f bc varied by 3 4 orders of magnitude for some 30 parent and alkyl polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons pahs on sediments impacted with bc and contamination similarly a meta analysis modeling studying on pahs and other chlorinated aromatics also concluded with a best model that has a 30 times uncertainty in predicting log k toc i e total organic carbon toc normalized solid water sorption coefficients k bc k d f toc for various types of bc arp et al 2009 the inability to predict log k bc accurately for different types of bcs and organic contaminants greatly hamper our capacity to assess or forecast their fate in different environments variability in log k bc may have its root in differing physical and chemical properties across different types of bc this remains to be explored past studies have focused on activated carbon walters and luthy 1984 wood char chiou et al 2015 james et al 2005 coal cornelissen et al 2005 for the dependence of log k bc on bc characteristics however similar investigation on soot bc which represents the graphitic end of the bc continuum has been rare recently chiou et al 2015 examined sorption on different bcs including biochar activated carbon and diesel soot using o xylene 1 2 3 trichlorobenzene and p nitrophenol as molecular probes nguyen et al 2004 2005 and nguyen and ball 2006 examined sorption on different soot samples however their investigation has been limited to only two sorbates two major challenges are often encountered when determining the sorption capacity of bc for organic contaminant in batch sorption system due to the high affinity exhibited by bc for the sorbate long equilibration time in the order of weeks braida et al 2003 plata et al 2015 to possibly months kuo et al 2007 is often needed extensive equilibration is necessary to guarantee that the sorbate diffuse slowly through the porous structure and channels at the intraparticular level luthy et al 1997 for bc the required equilibration time generally increases with the hydrophobicity of the sorbates kuo et al 2007 sun and zhou 2008 the second challenge is to balance among equilibration time extent of sorption and analytical limitation experimental sorption coefficients can be distorted when sorbate is overwhelmingly sorbed i e sorbed fraction 95 standard sorption guideline suggests that a well design sorption experiment should target sorbed fraction as between 20 and 50 oecd 2000 experimental studies huang et al 2003 have also prescribed similar range in their experimental design to ensure an optimal sorption range would require a lower solid to water ratio which tends to increase the equilibration time as ad sorption kinetics is slowed kuo et al 2007 wu and gschwend 1986 with high sorption capacity of bc the aqueous analyte concentration can be too low for detection quantification while this problem may be circumvented with the use of passive samplers additional handling and interpretation e g partitioning coefficient of sorbate between the sampler and the aqueous phase are needed both challenges greatly limit the utility applicability of batch sorption system in determining the sorption coefficients of high hydrophobicity sorbates in bc water system sorption of organic compounds can be simulated and determined via solid liquid column chromatography in column chromatography the retention time of the chemical signal i e the chemical peak encompasses both the flow and column conditions e g flow velocity and volume and the sorption affinity of the dissolved chemical for the solid phase through proper analysis of retention time of a chromatography peak the sorption coefficient of the chemical between the solid and the liquid phase can be determined from sorbent particle size column characteristics and pore water velocity schneider and smith 1968 showed that the moments of gas chromatography peaks could be used to determine the sorption rate constants in these column systems from the diffusivity of toluene in humic acid chang et al 1997 and humin shih and wu 2002 is around 10 8 10 9 cm2 s the penetration time for toluene into the organic matrix around 50 nm in this study is far less than 1 s schwarzenbach et al 2003 even assuming the size of bcs to be around 1 μm and the calculated diffusivity for naphthalene calibrated by molecular mass schwarzenbach et al 2003 it is still less than 1 s later holmén and gschwend 1997 also demonstrated that the moments of liquid chromatography peaks could be used to estimate the sorption rate constants and equilibrium constants of organic compounds in clay coated aquifer sands through the use of various clay sand columns on the other hand equilibration time can be influenced by system property such as solid to water ratio r sw kuo et al 2018 with a r sw of 2660000 mg l in this study the equilibrium time of 0 025 min may be anticipated supplementary information s1 this study aims to understand how soot black carbon s sorption capacity for organic contaminants varies with the sorbent properties with the following specific research tasks 1 determine the morphological pore structural compositional and surface chemical characteristics of the selected soot samples via a series of chemical and surface analyses 2 determine the sorption coefficients of 16 model organic compounds on the soot samples using reversed phase liquid chromatography 3 investigate how soot properties influence the sorption coefficients of model sorbates 4 develop linear solvation energy relationships lsers for log k bc s of the two soot samples and 5 explore the dependence of variability in bc sorption coefficients on sorbent properties over various types of bc two diesel soot samples were used as model soot bc sorbents with distinctive physical and chemical properties 2 materials and methods 2 1 black carbon samples two black carbon samples were investigated bc1 and bc2 bc1 was an industrial forklift soot standard reference material 2975 the national institute of standards and technology nist bc2 was soot sample collected from the engine of a local diesel truck in the middle of taiwan without further extraction 2 2 chemicals a total of 16 model sorbates were examined in the experiment acetonitrile dichloroethylene trichloroethylene tetrachloroethylene phenol 2 chlorophenol 4 chlorophenol 2 3 dichlorophenol 3 4 dichlorophenol benzene toluene ethyl benzene chlorobenzene m xylene diphenyl ether and naphthalene all test chemicals were purchased from sigma aldrich and had purity 99 stock solutions of the test compounds at concentration ranging from 5 to 750 mg l were prepared in deionized water these concentration levels were all less than 30 of the aqueous solubilities of the sorbates 2 3 characterization of black carbon samples the black carbon samples were characterized for their pore structure elemental composition and surface properties morphological and microstructural features were obtained with a field emission scanning electron microscope fe sem jeol jsm 6700f japan elemental compositions were determined with an elemental analyzer ea elementar vario el ⅲ germany surface area and pore structure were obtained from the nitrogen adsorption isotherms at 77k using an accelerated surface area and porosimetry apparatus micromeritics asap 2100 us all samples were out gassed at 105 c under vacuum before n2 adsorption with the n2 adsorption data the brunauer emmett teller bet surface area and total pore volume were determined using bet and the barret joyner halenda bjh adsorption methods respectively surface chemical functionality of the samples was conducted using x ray photoelectron spectroscopy xps vg scientific escalab 250 spectrometer uk with a monochromatized al kα x ray source the x ray xps measurements could probe a maximum sampling depth of approximately 10 nm and thus provided information about the chemical properties of the black carbon surface 2 4 sorption via reversed phase liquid chromatography rp lc the sorption coefficients of the 16 selected organic compounds on black carbons were obtained via the reversed phase liquid chromatography rp lc method li et al 2017 custom black carbon columns of the two soot samples were prepared small amount of soot sample 0 5 g was mixed with quartz sand 10 0 g well and then introduced into a stainless steel column of 25 cm in length and 0 46 cm in inner diameter the column was gently tapped from time to time during the filling process to ensure the sorbent was homogeneously packed as in batch sorption experiments deionized water was used as carrier fluid and pumped continuously through the prepared black carbon column prepared stock solutions of model chemicals were injected through a standard liquid chromatography injection valve at 200 μl chromatograms were obtained at three different pore water velocities i e 0 1 1 and 5 cm min the detection wavelengths were set at i 190 nm for acetonitrile ii 196 nm for diphenyl ether iii 208 nm for dichloroethylene trichloroethylene tetrachloroethylene benzene toluene m xylene and ethyl benzene iv 220 nm for chlorobenzene v 226 nm for acetone and vi 280 nm for phenol 2 chlorophenol 4 chlorophenol 2 3 dichlorophenol 3 4 dichlorophenol and naphthalene recoveries were between 89 and 108 for all compounds selected chromatographs were shown in the supplementary information s2 2 5 determining sorption coefficients on black carbon the method of moments was used to analyze the carbonaceous material column elution curves schneider and smith 1968 demonstrated that it is possible to calculate sorption rate constants from the moments of chromatography peaks the overall approach of the method is to relate moment of a chemical peak to its column retardation factor from which the sorption coefficient can be computed with the moment expressions of valocchi 1985 for a first order sorption model holmén 1995 the following governing equation applies 1 μ l v r f t o 2 where μ is the first absolute moment of the peak of interest l is the column length cm v is the column pore water velocity cm s r f is the column retardation factor and t 0 is the pulse duration s the retention time was solved from the emergence of the sorbate peak at different pore water velocities following the chromatographic method presented by holmén and gschwend 1997 holmén 1995 and chen 1996 r f could be obtained from the slope of a μ t 0 2 versus 1 v plot with l μ s and v s determined from the first moment of the conservative tracer nitrate l of 18 0 cm was estimated for the column with bc1 and 18 5 cm for bc2 supplementary information s3 the porosity was 0 49 and 0 51 for bc1 and bc2 column respectively the sorbate s black carbon sorption coefficient k bc could be derived from r f 2 r f 1 r s w f b c k b c where r sw is the solid to water ratio and f bc is the black carbon content the black carbon content in bc1 and bc2 column was 0 114 and 0 356 respectively the solid to water ratio was 2 76 for bc1 column and 2 66 for bc2 column due to the high polarity of acetone and acetonitrile some of their estimated first moments were less than the conservative tracer see supplementary information s4 indicating their sorption coefficients could not be obtained by this method a similar observation was found by holmén and gschwend 1997 for acetone furthermore these estimated sorption coefficients were calculated from rp hplc and used in the concentration range we performed the detectability of this method could limit the measure of the adsorption coefficients of the compounds with high hydrophobicity such as log k ow 4 2 for bcs we used 2 6 linear solvation energy relationships the reversed phase liquid chromatography rp lc method was used to obtain the black carbon sorption coefficients 16 non polar and polar organic compounds on pyrogenic carbon particles the interactions between organic compounds and black carbons were characterized via linear solvation energy relationships lsers the collected data were used to treat by the lser approach of abraham using the classical equation 3 log k d v v e e s s a a b b c where log k d is sorption coefficient v is the mcgowan volume e is excess molar refractivity s is the capability to stabilize neighboring charge or dipole a and b are the hydrogen bond acidity and basicity respectively v e s a and b are sorbate parameters determined experimentally and available from a databank that includes approximately 3000 organic compounds abraham et al 1999 abraham and platts 2001 platts et al 1999 the selected sorbates and their molecular properties are summarized in table 1 the coefficients v e s a and b c is a regression constant are the system coefficients that depict the contributions of the corresponding sorbate solvent sorbent interactions during sorption these coefficients are thus specific to the solvent solvent pair involved in sorbate transfer reaction or the solvent sorbent pair in sorption for the two examined black carbon water systems the respective v e s a and b were determined by applying multivariate linear regression on rp lc derived log k bc s with v e s a and b as independent predictors 3 results and discussion 3 1 morphology surface area and pore structure the morphology and microstructure of the two soot samples are shown in fig 1 both images show agglomerates of condensed nanometer scaled spherical particles with diameter of 50 nm or less all defining features of soot samples kuo et al 2013 although the size of the individual particles in bc1 nist and bc2 environmental soot were similar their sorbent matrices were visibly different the grape cluster feature was more clear and distinctive in bc1 whereas the individual soot particles in bc2 appeared to be more embedded to a continuous matrix of dense matter the markedly different sorbent matrices in the two samples likely reflected their different thermal histories during formation surface area analysis shows that bc1 has a considerably larger specific surface area than bc2 table 1 the n2 bet surface area of bc1 was determined to be 87 0 m2 g which was approximately 20 times higher than that of bc2 3 62 m2 g the majority pore volume in both samples were mesopores and macropores table 1 the total pore volumes for bc1 and bc2 were 0 254 and 0 046 cm3 g respectively the lower specific surface area and pore volume observed for bc2 were both consistent with its morphology fig 1 with much of the potential soot surface area that was lost upon the presence of the continuous matrix with higher surface area and pore volume bc1 is likely to have larger sorption capacities for organic sorbates in general 3 2 elemental analysis and surface chemistry elemental analysis suggested that the environmental soot sample bc2 had a more polar surface chemistry than the nist standard soot c h n and o composition of bc1 and bc2 are summarized in table 1 the c h o and n contents of bc1 were 88 1 2 20 5 74 and 2 08 respectively while those of bc2 were 44 6 2 50 26 3 and 1 69 respectively approximately a quarter of bc2 was impurity furthermore bc2 had a much higher o content while its c content was merely half of that of bc1 these compositional features suggested the presence of non soot material in bc2 they seemed also consistent with the extensive non spherical matrix in the morphology of bc2 discussed earlier the h c and o n c atomic ratios both indicated that bc2 had a more heterogeneous and polar surface chemistry than bc1 the h c ratio for bc1 and bc2 were 0 30 and 0 67 respectively the lower h c ratio implied a tighter h free bonding arrangement for c atoms in bc1 pointing possibly to graphitic configuration the o n c ratio for bc1 and bc2 were 0 069 and 0 475 respectively the significant presence of o and n in bc2 indicated a considerably more polarized and heterogeneous surface in the environmental soot sample than the nist standard these differences in surface chemistry would influence the sorption affinity of the soot samples for polar and non polar organic sorbates surface functional groups on the two samples were derived from the xps spectra fig 2 the spectra show two distinct peaks at 284 6 ev and 533 ev corresponding to c1s and o1s respectively two minor peaks associated with n1s were also observed at 399 5 ev not indicated the relative abundance of surface associated c and o was estimated from the c1s and o1s fine structures in the xps spectra table 1 the c o heterogenetic moieties in c1s spectra i e c o c o and coo coh were good indicators on the surface polarity of the samples the summed surface c o functionalities in bc1 and bc2 were estimated to be 7 3 and 11 7 respectively suggesting that bc2 surface was approximately 50 more oxygenated than that of bc1 3 3 black carbon sorption coefficients k bc the measured log k bc s for both black carbon samples are summarized in table 2 sorption to black carbon generally increased with the hydrophobicity of the sorbate consistent with that stipulated in earlier studies lu et al 2016 plata et al 2015 shih and gschwend 2009 the trend is best exemplified in the log k bc s of the phenols and the aromatic homologues taking bc1 as an example the log k bc s of phenol chlorophenol and dichlorophenol were measured to be 1 90 2 25 and 3 00 respectively while the log k bc s of benzene toluene ethylbenzene and m xylene were 1 76 2 15 2 58 and 2 86 respectively similar sorption pattern was also observed for bc2 experimental results suggest that bc1 generally exhibited stronger sorption affinity for organic compounds than bc2 on a mass basis the log k bc s determined from rp lc for the model chemicals along with their abraham solvation parameters are summarized in table 2 for the studied sorbates log k bc s of bc1 generally exceeded those of bc2 by 0 9 log unit on average fig 3 a for chloroethylenes chloro aromatics chlorophenols the log k bc s of bc1 were higher than those of bc2 by an average of 0 56 0 82 and 1 30 log unit respectively for diphenyl ether the difference in log k bc was only 0 17 log unit the more favorable sorption of organic sorbates on bc1 was consistent with its significantly higher surface area i e 20 that of bc2 and pore volume i e 5 that of bc2 however bc2 appeared to exhibit a greater affinity than bc1 for the sorbates when log k bc s were normalized by surface area fig 3b on average area normalized log k bc s were higher in bc2 than in bc1 by approximately 0 5 log unit low difference in area normalized log k bc was observed for chlorophenols i e difference ranged from 0 20 to 0 16 as well as benzene 0 30 and toluene 0 15 this was a somewhat surprising result particularly for apolar sorbates such as chloroethylenes and aromatics one would expect apolar sorbates to bind more strongly to the graphitic bc1 than to the more oxygenated bc2 due to the energetic drive to minimize cavitation cost associated with water molecules schwarzenbach et al 2003 the influence of surface chemistry on sorption may be revealed by examining the difference in log k bc between the two soot samples as a function of sorbate s physicochemical properties this can be done by examining the difference in log k bc calculated as δlog k bc log k bc bc1 log k bc bc2 using surface area normalized k bc s area based k bc s allowed the effect of surface area to be separated from the surface chemistry fig 4 a shows that there was no clear dependence between log k bc and the sorbate s hydrophobicity as represented by log k ow qualitatively bc1 and bc2 represented two ends of the soot black carbon spectrum one end was graphitic i e bc1 while the other was relatively amorphous and oxygenated i e bc2 a negative δlog k bc thus implied sorption was enhanced when going from graphitic soot bc1 to oxygenated soot bc2 see also fig 3b the ability for the sorbate to engage in specific interactions with the oxygenated surface such as h bonding may be a critical factor in controlling δlog k bc preliminary analysis showed that δlog k bc was correlated to both the h donating and h accepting parameters a and b ρ xy 0 69 and 0 40 respectively see supplementary information s5 an interesting trend emerged when a and b were summed and then normalized by the sorbates molecular weight fig 4b fig 4b implies an unusual and somewhat counter intuitive conclusion that the abundance of oxygenated surfaces on soot would not affect k bc much for sorbates with strong h bonding capacity but would significantly increase k bc for nonpolar sorbates weak in h bonding 3 4 lsers for log k bc based on the measured log k bc s table 2 two linear solvation energy relationship lser equations were constructed since phenol and acetonitrile were not measured in both soot samples out of consistency only sorption data of the remaining 14 chemicals were used for lser development the lser equations are shown in eqs 4 and 5 while the prediction plots are presented in fig 5 a and 5b both lsers had excellent correspondence with the experimental log k bc s with r 2 of 0 97 and 1 00 for bc1 and bc2 respectively for bc1 4 log k b c 2 49 0 65 e 2 71 0 88 s 1 17 0 46 a 2 52 0 34 v n 14 std err 0 21 r 2 1 00 for bc2 5 log k b c 1 12 0 39 e 1 68 0 32 s 3 70 0 57 b 4 37 0 38 v 1 51 0 22 n 14 std err 0 16 r 2 0 97 stepwise regression suggested that e s and v were significant for both soot samples while a was needed in bc1 and b in bc2 only all the other omitted terms were found to be insignificantly different from zero during the regression procedure supplementary information s6 the apparent insignificance of specific interactions terms e g bb for bc1 and aa for bc2 and the varying nature of some interactions e g s a during the stepwise regression may be artifacts arisen from the correlation between the abraham descriptors in the probe chemicals e g e s supplementary information s7 some of these interdependency may be intrinsic for instance arey et al 2005 have demonstrated that e and s are inherently correlated overall the resulting lsers can be further refined with more test chemicals with less interdependent abraham descriptors the derived soot lsers were broadly consistent with the expected interactions existing between the sorbates in the soot aqueous system vv signifies the cavitation cost associated with solvating sorbate with water molecules and thus favors adsorption onto bc with larger molecule reflected by a larger v ee and ss together represent various dispersive and dipolar interactions that contribute to the van der waals force cavitation cost and van der waals interactions were expected for the organic sorbates in both soot samples aa refers to the h bonding interaction with the sorbate acting as h bond donor while bb signifies the capacity of the sorbate as h bond acceptor the presence of aa but not bb in bc1 lser implied that the surface of bc1 was good at accepting h bond i e π electrons associated with aromatic moieties but weak as h bond donor i e lacking h this was consistent with the graphitic nature of bc1 low o n c ratio table 1 the presence of bb term in bc2 lser with a substantially negative b implied that sorbates with strong h bond basicity would be less favorably sorbed to bc2 this may be understood as the repulsive interaction occurred between the lone pair electrons between bc2 which was approximately 25 oxygenated and sorbates with strong h bond basicity the negative b value was thus consistent with the repulsive interaction between bc2 and sorbate lone pair electrons since the o n c ratio in bc2 was almost 7 times that in bc1 one may reasonably expect an abundance of lone pair electrons in bc2 available for h bonding and thus a strong aa term it is unclear why aa interaction was not included in the bc2 lser one plausible explanation was that aa was missing due to regression artifact the evolution of s and a coefficients during the stepwise regression for bc2 lser supplementary information s6 showed that if a was statistically significant then s would be statistically negligible and vice versa furthermore the magnitude of a and s varied in a complementary manner from model to model i e the sum of a and s was more or less conserved it is likely that the regression had failed to capture the h donating aa and dipolar ss interactions separately it was also possible that part of the aa was incorporated into the cavity term vv as the v coefficient also fluctuated with the on and off of aa term it is generally expected that sorbates with larger size i e larger v and higher polarizability i e larger e will sorb more favorably to soot while sorption is expected to weaken with an increase in dipolarity s and h bonding capacity i e a and b of the sorbate both lsers have positive e s and v s but negative s s and b s which were consistent with expectation 3 5 correlation between log k bc and specific surface area further analysis of literature log k bc values suggested that log k bc and log ssa specific surface area may be linearly correlated across different bc samples black carbon sorption coefficients were collected from primarily experimental literature braida et al 2003 lu et al 2016 plata et al 2015 shih and gschwend 2009 on various types of black carbon e g wood char activated carbon soot etc with specific surface area characterized by the n2 bet method bc sorption inferred from sediment or soil studies were not included as bc might be overwhelmed by both authigenic and allogenic organic matter present as past studies focused mostly on legacy contaminants such as polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons and polychlorinated biphenyls most of the sorbates examined in this work had not been investigated in other bc sorption studies as a result only log k bc for benzene and toluene were analyzed here although log k bc data were gathered from 4 to 5 different studies linear correlation was observed between log k bc and log ssa for both benzene and toluene i e r 2 0 91 and 0 88 respectively fig 6 a and 6b the correlation was significant as it encompassed soot char charcoal and activated carbon with ssa spanning from 4 to 600 m2 g similar trend between log k and log ssa has also been reported on litter derived biochar though over a narrower ssa range i e 60 340 m2 g uchimiya et al 2010 although ssa may be an important factor influencing k bc it is not the sole controlling factor since the slopes for both benzene and toluene are less than 1 i e k bc ssa or log k bc log ssa constant fig 6 varying surface chemistry partitioning into amorphous organic components chiou et al 2000 accardi dey and gschwend 2003 as well as pore filling into microporous volume xia and ball 1999 xia and pignatello 2001 can also be important given that both benzene and toluene are apolar it is unclear if the same trend would apply to polar or ionizable organic compounds such as phenols dependence of benzene and toluene log k bc on other sorbent chemical properties such as surface polarity or elemental ratio could not be examined as they were not characterized in previous studies 3 6 implications this study suggests that the sorption capacity of black carbon can be better estimated for remediation actions for biochar and activated carbon applied for site cleanup purpose their specific surface areas are often known the sorption coefficient for the concerned contaminant can be more accurately assessed if its log k bc log ssa relationship is known correlation as such remains to be verified for other organic compounds and micropollutants and to be explored with respect to sorbate chemical functionality similar investigations as in uchimiya et al 2010 or meta analysis following fig 6 should be conducted for other organic contaminants a more far reaching implication from this work is that a unified sorption model for variant black carbons may be possible black carbon encompasses a wide spectrum of condensed carbonaceous materials with varying morphology elemental composition and surface chemistry cornelissen et al 2005 hammes et al 2007 masiello 2004 fig 6 shows that the sorption affinity of diverse black carbons can be unified under a common specific surface area based correlation previous works have suggested that orders of magnitude of variability in log k oc or log k bc appear unavoidable arp et al 2009 hawthorne et al 2007 2006 however these studies were not able to examine the dependence of log k bc on specific surface area on comprehensive scale with surface characterization generally lacking surface characterization of environmental black carbon in soils and sediments can be challenging due to the both authigenic and allogenic non bc organic components however such characterization may be done or supplemented using elemental mapping analysis by electron microscopy kuo et al 2013 4 conclusions sorption characteristics of two diesel soot samples were probed and examined using reversed phase liquid chromatography and a suite of 16 model organic sorbates with varying chemical functionality and polarity chemical and spectral analyses showed that the two soot samples had very different morphology elemental composition pore structure and surface chemistry bc1 was associated with a larger and more graphitic surface area while bc2 was more amorphous and oxygenated with a smaller surface area on the mass basis log k bc s of bc1 were found larger than those of bc2 for all investigated sorbates however when normalized by the surface area the opposite was observed with the sorption coefficients of bc2 exceeding those of bc1 considerably in particular for the apolar sorbates lsers developed for the two soot samples suggested that a consistent mechanistic picture of sorption for both samples van der waals interaction and cavity formation expressed by the ee ss and vv terms both contributed towards stronger sorption on soot black carbon for the graphitic bc1 sorbates with h bond acidity as depicted by a 0 were found to exhibit a stronger sorption affinity on soot surface as reflected by a positive a in the lser for the amorphous and oxygenated bc2 sorbates exhibiting h bond basicity as depicted by b 0 would exhibit a weakened affinity for the sorbent as indicated by a substantially negative b analysis of sorption data of benzene and toluene to various black carbons showed that log k bc and log ssa were closely correlated this suggests that the mass based sorption capacity of black carbon with drastically different physical and chemical characteristics may be depicted and predicted by a unified black carbon sorption model with the sorbent specific surface area as a key input variable the applicability of the log k bc log ssa correlation to other organic sorbates or families remains to be explored and documented it may be challenging to extend and apply the log k bc log ssa correlation to environmental black carbon in soils or sediments differentiation of authigenic or allogenic organic matter from black carbon or other condensed carbonaceous materials to derive surface area properties can be difficult with conventional chemical analysis however semi quantitative estimation of sorbent surface properties may be possible with elemental mapping techniques acknowledgements the authors are grateful for the financial support from national science

19399,substantial variability in sorption capacity of black carbon bc has been a major challenge for accurate fate and risk assessment of organic pollutants in soils and sediments 16 model organic

larger than those of bc1 suggesting that the overall sorption was more favored on the oxygenated sorbent per area basis linear solvation energy relationships lsers for sorption onto bc1 and bc2 were

xing 2017 black carbon bc refers to condensed carbonaceous materials with pyrogenic origin such as soot and charcoal bc encompasses a continuum of materials with varying morphology structure and composition elmquist et al 2006 which are controlled dependent on the different starting materials and thermal history elmquist et al 2006 schmidt and noack 2000 bc is of great scientific interest atmospheric bc contributes significantly towards global warming bond et al 2013 while soil sediment bound bc often serves as sinks for various organic contaminants cornelissen et al 2005 because of its ubiquity in the environment and its production from both natural and anthropogenic combustion processes bc is considered an important biogeochemical component masiello and druffel 1998 schmidt et al 2001 the recalcitrance and mobility of bcs not only influence their own environmental fate xu et al 2017 but also play a key role in the fate of organic pollutants in the environment accardi dey and gschwend 2003 chiou et al 2015 cornelissen et al 2005 huang et al 2006 kuo et al 2007 lian and xing 2017 it has been generally accepted that bc exhibits far stronger sorption affinity for organic compounds than organic carbon in the environment it has been shown that small quantities of bc can influence sorption of organic contaminants in soils yang and shen 2003 james et al 2005 or sediments accardi dey and gschwend 2003 kuo et al 2007 significantly previous studies have indicated that the sorption capacity of bc may be 10 1000 times stronger than that of other natural organic matter for organic contaminants bucheli and gustafsson 2000 cornelissen et al 2005 this implies that bc can strongly influence the mobility and persistence of organic contaminants in soil and sediment environments via sorptive interaction enhanced sorption of various organic contaminants to other forms of condensed carbonaceous materials has also been reported for coal kleineidam et al 2002 charcoal yang and sheng 2003 and activated carbon matsui et al 2002 however considerable variability in sorption coefficients have been reported for various types of bc james et al 2005 reported a 3 orders of magnitude variation in apparent char sorption coefficients determined for phenanthrene with various natural and artificial wood char the study demonstrated that even with well defined and freshly prepared wood char sorption capacity varied with different starting materials and thermal conditions later hawthorne et al 1997 reported that log k bc i e black carbon normalized solid water sorption coefficient k bc k d f bc varied by 3 4 orders of magnitude for some 30 parent and alkyl polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons pahs on sediments impacted with bc and contamination similarly a meta analysis modeling studying on pahs and other chlorinated aromatics also concluded with a best model that has a 30 times uncertainty in predicting log k toc i e total organic carbon toc normalized solid water sorption coefficients k bc k d f toc for various types of bc arp et al 2009 the inability to predict log k bc accurately for different types of bcs and organic contaminants greatly hamper our capacity to assess or forecast their fate in different environments variability in log k bc may have its root in differing physical and chemical properties across different types of bc this remains to be explored past studies have focused on activated carbon walters and luthy 1984 wood char chiou et al 2015 james et al 2005 coal cornelissen et al 2005 for the dependence of log k bc on bc characteristics however similar investigation on soot bc which represents the graphitic end of the bc continuum has been rare recently chiou et al 2015 examined sorption on different bcs including biochar activated carbon and diesel soot using o xylene 1 2 3 trichlorobenzene and p nitrophenol as molecular probes nguyen et al 2004 2005 and nguyen and ball 2006 examined sorption on different soot samples however their investigation has been limited to only two sorbates two major challenges are often encountered when determining the sorption capacity of bc for organic contaminant in batch sorption system due to the high affinity exhibited by bc for the sorbate long equilibration time in the order of weeks braida et al 2003 plata et al 2015 to possibly months kuo et al 2007 is often needed extensive equilibration is necessary to guarantee that the sorbate diffuse slowly through the porous structure and channels at the intraparticular level luthy et al 1997 for bc the required equilibration time generally increases with the hydrophobicity of the sorbates kuo et al 2007 sun and zhou 2008 the second challenge is to balance among equilibration time extent of sorption and analytical limitation experimental sorption coefficients can be distorted when sorbate is overwhelmingly sorbed i e sorbed fraction 95 standard sorption guideline suggests that a well design sorption experiment should target sorbed fraction as between 20 and 50 oecd 2000 experimental studies huang et al 2003 have also prescribed similar range in their experimental design to ensure an optimal sorption range would require a lower solid to water ratio which tends to increase the equilibration time as ad sorption kinetics is slowed kuo et al 2007 wu and gschwend 1986 with high sorption capacity of bc the aqueous analyte concentration can be too low for detection quantification while this problem may be circumvented with the use of passive samplers additional handling and interpretation e g partitioning coefficient of sorbate between the sampler and the aqueous phase are needed both challenges greatly limit the utility applicability of batch sorption system in determining the sorption coefficients of high hydrophobicity sorbates in bc water system sorption of organic compounds can be simulated and determined via solid liquid column chromatography in column chromatography the retention time of the chemical signal i e the chemical peak encompasses both the flow and column conditions e g flow velocity and volume and the sorption affinity of the dissolved chemical for the solid phase through proper analysis of retention time of a chromatography peak the sorption coefficient of the chemical between the solid and the liquid phase can be determined from sorbent particle size column characteristics and pore water velocity schneider and smith 1968 showed that the moments of gas chromatography peaks could be used to determine the sorption rate constants in these column systems from the diffusivity of toluene in humic acid chang et al 1997 and humin shih and wu 2002 is around 10 8 10 9 cm2 s the penetration time for toluene into the organic matrix around 50 nm in this study is far less than 1 s schwarzenbach et al 2003 even assuming the size of bcs to be around 1 μm and the calculated diffusivity for naphthalene calibrated by molecular mass schwarzenbach et al 2003 it is still less than 1 s later holmén and gschwend 1997 also demonstrated that the moments of liquid chromatography peaks could be used to estimate the sorption rate constants and equilibrium constants of organic compounds in clay coated aquifer sands through the use of various clay sand columns on the other hand equilibration time can be influenced by system property such as solid to water ratio r sw kuo et al 2018 with a r sw of 2660000 mg l in this study the equilibrium time of 0 025 min may be anticipated supplementary information s1 this study aims to understand how soot black carbon s sorption capacity for organic contaminants varies with the sorbent properties with the following specific research tasks 1 determine the morphological pore structural compositional and surface chemical characteristics of the selected soot samples via a series of chemical and surface analyses 2 determine the sorption coefficients of 16 model organic compounds on the soot samples using reversed phase liquid chromatography 3 investigate how soot properties influence the sorption coefficients of model sorbates 4 develop linear solvation energy relationships lsers for log k bc s of the two soot samples and 5 explore the dependence of variability in bc sorption coefficients on sorbent properties over various types of bc two diesel soot samples were used as model soot bc sorbents with distinctive physical and chemical properties 2 materials and methods 2 1 black carbon samples two black carbon samples were investigated bc1 and bc2 bc1 was an industrial forklift soot standard reference material 2975 the national institute of standards and technology nist bc2 was soot sample collected from the engine of a local diesel truck in the middle of taiwan without further extraction 2 2 chemicals a total of 16 model sorbates were examined in the experiment acetonitrile dichloroethylene trichloroethylene tetrachloroethylene phenol 2 chlorophenol 4 chlorophenol 2 3 dichlorophenol 3 4 dichlorophenol benzene toluene ethyl benzene chlorobenzene m xylene diphenyl ether and naphthalene all test chemicals were purchased from sigma aldrich and had purity 99 stock solutions of the test compounds at concentration ranging from 5 to 750 mg l were prepared in deionized water these concentration levels were all less than 30 of the aqueous solubilities of the sorbates 2 3 characterization of black carbon samples the black carbon samples were characterized for their pore structure elemental composition and surface properties morphological and microstructural features were obtained with a field emission scanning electron microscope fe sem jeol jsm 6700f japan elemental compositions were determined with an elemental analyzer ea elementar vario el ⅲ germany surface area and pore structure were obtained from the nitrogen adsorption isotherms at 77k using an accelerated surface area and porosimetry apparatus micromeritics asap 2100 us all samples were out gassed at 105 c under vacuum before n2 adsorption with the n2 adsorption data the brunauer emmett teller bet surface area and total pore volume were determined using bet and the barret joyner halenda bjh adsorption methods respectively surface chemical functionality of the samples was conducted using x ray photoelectron spectroscopy xps vg scientific escalab 250 spectrometer uk with a monochromatized al kα x ray source the x ray xps measurements could probe a maximum sampling depth of approximately 10 nm and thus provided information about the chemical properties of the black carbon surface 2 4 sorption via reversed phase liquid chromatography rp lc the sorption coefficients of the 16 selected organic compounds on black carbons were obtained via the reversed phase liquid chromatography rp lc method li et al 2017 custom black carbon columns of the two soot samples were prepared small amount of soot sample 0 5 g was mixed with quartz sand 10 0 g well and then introduced into a stainless steel column of 25 cm in length and 0 46 cm in inner diameter the column was gently tapped from time to time during the filling process to ensure the sorbent was homogeneously packed as in batch sorption experiments deionized water was used as carrier fluid and pumped continuously through the prepared black carbon column prepared stock solutions of model chemicals were injected through a standard liquid chromatography injection valve at 200 μl chromatograms were obtained at three different pore water velocities i e 0 1 1 and 5 cm min the detection wavelengths were set at i 190 nm for acetonitrile ii 196 nm for diphenyl ether iii 208 nm for dichloroethylene trichloroethylene tetrachloroethylene benzene toluene m xylene and ethyl benzene iv 220 nm for chlorobenzene v 226 nm for acetone and vi 280 nm for phenol 2 chlorophenol 4 chlorophenol 2 3 dichlorophenol 3 4 dichlorophenol and naphthalene recoveries were between 89 and 108 for all compounds selected chromatographs were shown in the supplementary information s2 2 5 determining sorption coefficients on black carbon the method of moments was used to analyze the carbonaceous material column elution curves schneider and smith 1968 demonstrated that it is possible to calculate sorption rate constants from the moments of chromatography peaks the overall approach of the method is to relate moment of a chemical peak to its column retardation factor from which the sorption coefficient can be computed with the moment expressions of valocchi 1985 for a first order sorption model holmén 1995 the following governing equation applies 1 μ l v r f t o 2 where μ is the first absolute moment of the peak of interest l is the column length cm v is the column pore water velocity cm s r f is the column retardation factor and t 0 is the pulse duration s the retention time was solved from the emergence of the sorbate peak at different pore water velocities following the chromatographic method presented by holmén and gschwend 1997 holmén 1995 and chen 1996 r f could be obtained from the slope of a μ t 0 2 versus 1 v plot with l μ s and v s determined from the first moment of the conservative tracer nitrate l of 18 0 cm was estimated for the column with bc1 and 18 5 cm for bc2 supplementary information s3 the porosity was 0 49 and 0 51 for bc1 and bc2 column respectively the sorbate s black carbon sorption coefficient k bc could be derived from r f 2 r f 1 r s w f b c k b c where r sw is the solid to water ratio and f bc is the black carbon content the black carbon content in bc1 and bc2 column was 0 114 and 0 356 respectively the solid to water ratio was 2 76 for bc1 column and 2 66 for bc2 column due to the high polarity of acetone and acetonitrile some of their estimated first moments were less than the conservative tracer see supplementary information s4 indicating their sorption coefficients could not be obtained by this method a similar observation was found by holmén and gschwend 1997 for acetone furthermore these estimated sorption coefficients were calculated from rp hplc and used in the concentration range we performed the detectability of this method could limit the measure of the adsorption coefficients of the compounds with high hydrophobicity such as log k ow 4 2 for bcs we used 2 6 linear solvation energy relationships the reversed phase liquid chromatography rp lc method was used to obtain the black carbon sorption coefficients 16 non polar and polar organic compounds on pyrogenic carbon particles the interactions between organic compounds and black carbons were characterized via linear solvation energy relationships lsers the collected data were used to treat by the lser approach of abraham using the classical equation 3 log k d v v e e s s a a b b c where log k d is sorption coefficient v is the mcgowan volume e is excess molar refractivity s is the capability to stabilize neighboring charge or dipole a and b are the hydrogen bond acidity and basicity respectively v e s a and b are sorbate parameters determined experimentally and available from a databank that includes approximately 3000 organic compounds abraham et al 1999 abraham and platts 2001 platts et al 1999 the selected sorbates and their molecular properties are summarized in table 1 the coefficients v e s a and b c is a regression constant are the system coefficients that depict the contributions of the corresponding sorbate solvent sorbent interactions during sorption these coefficients are thus specific to the solvent solvent pair involved in sorbate transfer reaction or the solvent sorbent pair in sorption for the two examined black carbon water systems the respective v e s a and b were determined by applying multivariate linear regression on rp lc derived log k bc s with v e s a and b as independent predictors 3 results and discussion 3 1 morphology surface area and pore structure the morphology and microstructure of the two soot samples are shown in fig 1 both images show agglomerates of condensed nanometer scaled spherical particles with diameter of 50 nm or less all defining features of soot samples kuo et al 2013 although the size of the individual particles in bc1 nist and bc2 environmental soot were similar their sorbent matrices were visibly different the grape cluster feature was more clear and distinctive in bc1 whereas the individual soot particles in bc2 appeared to be more embedded to a continuous matrix of dense matter the markedly different sorbent matrices in the two samples likely reflected their different thermal histories during formation surface area analysis shows that bc1 has a considerably larger specific surface area than bc2 table 1 the n2 bet surface area of bc1 was determined to be 87 0 m2 g which was approximately 20 times higher than that of bc2 3 62 m2 g the majority pore volume in both samples were mesopores and macropores table 1 the total pore volumes for bc1 and bc2 were 0 254 and 0 046 cm3 g respectively the lower specific surface area and pore volume observed for bc2 were both consistent with its morphology fig 1 with much of the potential soot surface area that was lost upon the presence of the continuous matrix with higher surface area and pore volume bc1 is likely to have larger sorption capacities for organic sorbates in general 3 2 elemental analysis and surface chemistry elemental analysis suggested that the environmental soot sample bc2 had a more polar surface chemistry than the nist standard soot c h n and o composition of bc1 and bc2 are summarized in table 1 the c h o and n contents of bc1 were 88 1 2 20 5 74 and 2 08 respectively while those of bc2 were 44 6 2 50 26 3 and 1 69 respectively approximately a quarter of bc2 was impurity furthermore bc2 had a much higher o content while its c content was merely half of that of bc1 these compositional features suggested the presence of non soot material in bc2 they seemed also consistent with the extensive non spherical matrix in the morphology of bc2 discussed earlier the h c and o n c atomic ratios both indicated that bc2 had a more heterogeneous and polar surface chemistry than bc1 the h c ratio for bc1 and bc2 were 0 30 and 0 67 respectively the lower h c ratio implied a tighter h free bonding arrangement for c atoms in bc1 pointing possibly to graphitic configuration the o n c ratio for bc1 and bc2 were 0 069 and 0 475 respectively the significant presence of o and n in bc2 indicated a considerably more polarized and heterogeneous surface in the environmental soot sample than the nist standard these differences in surface chemistry would influence the sorption affinity of the soot samples for polar and non polar organic sorbates surface functional groups on the two samples were derived from the xps spectra fig 2 the spectra show two distinct peaks at 284 6 ev and 533 ev corresponding to c1s and o1s respectively two minor peaks associated with n1s were also observed at 399 5 ev not indicated the relative abundance of surface associated c and o was estimated from the c1s and o1s fine structures in the xps spectra table 1 the c o heterogenetic moieties in c1s spectra i e c o c o and coo coh were good indicators on the surface polarity of the samples the summed surface c o functionalities in bc1 and bc2 were estimated to be 7 3 and 11 7 respectively suggesting that bc2 surface was approximately 50 more oxygenated than that of bc1 3 3 black carbon sorption coefficients k bc the measured log k bc s for both black carbon samples are summarized in table 2 sorption to black carbon generally increased with the hydrophobicity of the sorbate consistent with that stipulated in earlier studies lu et al 2016 plata et al 2015 shih and gschwend 2009 the trend is best exemplified in the log k bc s of the phenols and the aromatic homologues taking bc1 as an example the log k bc s of phenol chlorophenol and dichlorophenol were measured to be 1 90 2 25 and 3 00 respectively while the log k bc s of benzene toluene ethylbenzene and m xylene were 1 76 2 15 2 58 and 2 86 respectively similar sorption pattern was also observed for bc2 experimental results suggest that bc1 generally exhibited stronger sorption affinity for organic compounds than bc2 on a mass basis the log k bc s determined from rp lc for the model chemicals along with their abraham solvation parameters are summarized in table 2 for the studied sorbates log k bc s of bc1 generally exceeded those of bc2 by 0 9 log unit on average fig 3 a for chloroethylenes chloro aromatics chlorophenols the log k bc s of bc1 were higher than those of bc2 by an average of 0 56 0 82 and 1 30 log unit respectively for diphenyl ether the difference in log k bc was only 0 17 log unit the more favorable sorption of organic sorbates on bc1 was consistent with its significantly higher surface area i e 20 that of bc2 and pore volume i e 5 that of bc2 however bc2 appeared to exhibit a greater affinity than bc1 for the sorbates when log k bc s were normalized by surface area fig 3b on average area normalized log k bc s were higher in bc2 than in bc1 by approximately 0 5 log unit low difference in area normalized log k bc was observed for chlorophenols i e difference ranged from 0 20 to 0 16 as well as benzene 0 30 and toluene 0 15 this was a somewhat surprising result particularly for apolar sorbates such as chloroethylenes and aromatics one would expect apolar sorbates to bind more strongly to the graphitic bc1 than to the more oxygenated bc2 due to the energetic drive to minimize cavitation cost associated with water molecules schwarzenbach et al 2003 the influence of surface chemistry on sorption may be revealed by examining the difference in log k bc between the two soot samples as a function of sorbate s physicochemical properties this can be done by examining the difference in log k bc calculated as δlog k bc log k bc bc1 log k bc bc2 using surface area normalized k bc s area based k bc s allowed the effect of surface area to be separated from the surface chemistry fig 4 a shows that there was no clear dependence between log k bc and the sorbate s hydrophobicity as represented by log k ow qualitatively bc1 and bc2 represented two ends of the soot black carbon spectrum one end was graphitic i e bc1 while the other was relatively amorphous and oxygenated i e bc2 a negative δlog k bc thus implied sorption was enhanced when going from graphitic soot bc1 to oxygenated soot bc2 see also fig 3b the ability for the sorbate to engage in specific interactions with the oxygenated surface such as h bonding may be a critical factor in controlling δlog k bc preliminary analysis showed that δlog k bc was correlated to both the h donating and h accepting parameters a and b ρ xy 0 69 and 0 40 respectively see supplementary information s5 an interesting trend emerged when a and b were summed and then normalized by the sorbates molecular weight fig 4b fig 4b implies an unusual and somewhat counter intuitive conclusion that the abundance of oxygenated surfaces on soot would not affect k bc much for sorbates with strong h bonding capacity but would significantly increase k bc for nonpolar sorbates weak in h bonding 3 4 lsers for log k bc based on the measured log k bc s table 2 two linear solvation energy relationship lser equations were constructed since phenol and acetonitrile were not measured in both soot samples out of consistency only sorption data of the remaining 14 chemicals were used for lser development the lser equations are shown in eqs 4 and 5 while the prediction plots are presented in fig 5 a and 5b both lsers had excellent correspondence with the experimental log k bc s with r 2 of 0 97 and 1 00 for bc1 and bc2 respectively for bc1 4 log k b c 2 49 0 65 e 2 71 0 88 s 1 17 0 46 a 2 52 0 34 v n 14 std err 0 21 r 2 1 00 for bc2 5 log k b c 1 12 0 39 e 1 68 0 32 s 3 70 0 57 b 4 37 0 38 v 1 51 0 22 n 14 std err 0 16 r 2 0 97 stepwise regression suggested that e s and v were significant for both soot samples while a was needed in bc1 and b in bc2 only all the other omitted terms were found to be insignificantly different from zero during the regression procedure supplementary information s6 the apparent insignificance of specific interactions terms e g bb for bc1 and aa for bc2 and the varying nature of some interactions e g s a during the stepwise regression may be artifacts arisen from the correlation between the abraham descriptors in the probe chemicals e g e s supplementary information s7 some of these interdependency may be intrinsic for instance arey et al 2005 have demonstrated that e and s are inherently correlated overall the resulting lsers can be further refined with more test chemicals with less interdependent abraham descriptors the derived soot lsers were broadly consistent with the expected interactions existing between the sorbates in the soot aqueous system vv signifies the cavitation cost associated with solvating sorbate with water molecules and thus favors adsorption onto bc with larger molecule reflected by a larger v ee and ss together represent various dispersive and dipolar interactions that contribute to the van der waals force cavitation cost and van der waals interactions were expected for the organic sorbates in both soot samples aa refers to the h bonding interaction with the sorbate acting as h bond donor while bb signifies the capacity of the sorbate as h bond acceptor the presence of aa but not bb in bc1 lser implied that the surface of bc1 was good at accepting h bond i e π electrons associated with aromatic moieties but weak as h bond donor i e lacking h this was consistent with the graphitic nature of bc1 low o n c ratio table 1 the presence of bb term in bc2 lser with a substantially negative b implied that sorbates with strong h bond basicity would be less favorably sorbed to bc2 this may be understood as the repulsive interaction occurred between the lone pair electrons between bc2 which was approximately 25 oxygenated and sorbates with strong h bond basicity the negative b value was thus consistent with the repulsive interaction between bc2 and sorbate lone pair electrons since the o n c ratio in bc2 was almost 7 times that in bc1 one may reasonably expect an abundance of lone pair electrons in bc2 available for h bonding and thus a strong aa term it is unclear why aa interaction was not included in the bc2 lser one plausible explanation was that aa was missing due to regression artifact the evolution of s and a coefficients during the stepwise regression for bc2 lser supplementary information s6 showed that if a was statistically significant then s would be statistically negligible and vice versa furthermore the magnitude of a and s varied in a complementary manner from model to model i e the sum of a and s was more or less conserved it is likely that the regression had failed to capture the h donating aa and dipolar ss interactions separately it was also possible that part of the aa was incorporated into the cavity term vv as the v coefficient also fluctuated with the on and off of aa term it is generally expected that sorbates with larger size i e larger v and higher polarizability i e larger e will sorb more favorably to soot while sorption is expected to weaken with an increase in dipolarity s and h bonding capacity i e a and b of the sorbate both lsers have positive e s and v s but negative s s and b s which were consistent with expectation 3 5 correlation between log k bc and specific surface area further analysis of literature log k bc values suggested that log k bc and log ssa specific surface area may be linearly correlated across different bc samples black carbon sorption coefficients were collected from primarily experimental literature braida et al 2003 lu et al 2016 plata et al 2015 shih and gschwend 2009 on various types of black carbon e g wood char activated carbon soot etc with specific surface area characterized by the n2 bet method bc sorption inferred from sediment or soil studies were not included as bc might be overwhelmed by both authigenic and allogenic organic matter present as past studies focused mostly on legacy contaminants such as polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons and polychlorinated biphenyls most of the sorbates examined in this work had not been investigated in other bc sorption studies as a result only log k bc for benzene and toluene were analyzed here although log k bc data were gathered from 4 to 5 different studies linear correlation was observed between log k bc and log ssa for both benzene and toluene i e r 2 0 91 and 0 88 respectively fig 6 a and 6b the correlation was significant as it encompassed soot char charcoal and activated carbon with ssa spanning from 4 to 600 m2 g similar trend between log k and log ssa has also been reported on litter derived biochar though over a narrower ssa range i e 60 340 m2 g uchimiya et al 2010 although ssa may be an important factor influencing k bc it is not the sole controlling factor since the slopes for both benzene and toluene are less than 1 i e k bc ssa or log k bc log ssa constant fig 6 varying surface chemistry partitioning into amorphous organic components chiou et al 2000 accardi dey and gschwend 2003 as well as pore filling into microporous volume xia and ball 1999 xia and pignatello 2001 can also be important given that both benzene and toluene are apolar it is unclear if the same trend would apply to polar or ionizable organic compounds such as phenols dependence of benzene and toluene log k bc on other sorbent chemical properties such as surface polarity or elemental ratio could not be examined as they were not characterized in previous studies 3 6 implications this study suggests that the sorption capacity of black carbon can be better estimated for remediation actions for biochar and activated carbon applied for site cleanup purpose their specific surface areas are often known the sorption coefficient for the concerned contaminant can be more accurately assessed if its log k bc log ssa relationship is known correlation as such remains to be verified for other organic compounds and micropollutants and to be explored with respect to sorbate chemical functionality similar investigations as in uchimiya et al 2010 or meta analysis following fig 6 should be conducted for other organic contaminants a more far reaching implication from this work is that a unified sorption model for variant black carbons may be possible black carbon encompasses a wide spectrum of condensed carbonaceous materials with varying morphology elemental composition and surface chemistry cornelissen et al 2005 hammes et al 2007 masiello 2004 fig 6 shows that the sorption affinity of diverse black carbons can be unified under a common specific surface area based correlation previous works have suggested that orders of magnitude of variability in log k oc or log k bc appear unavoidable arp et al 2009 hawthorne et al 2007 2006 however these studies were not able to examine the dependence of log k bc on specific surface area on comprehensive scale with surface characterization generally lacking surface characterization of environmental black carbon in soils and sediments can be challenging due to the both authigenic and allogenic non bc organic components however such characterization may be done or supplemented using elemental mapping analysis by electron microscopy kuo et al 2013 4 conclusions sorption characteristics of two diesel soot samples were probed and examined using reversed phase liquid chromatography and a suite of 16 model organic sorbates with varying chemical functionality and polarity chemical and spectral analyses showed that the two soot samples had very different morphology elemental composition pore structure and surface chemistry bc1 was associated with a larger and more graphitic surface area while bc2 was more amorphous and oxygenated with a smaller surface area on the mass basis log k bc s of bc1 were found larger than those of bc2 for all investigated sorbates however when normalized by the surface area the opposite was observed with the sorption coefficients of bc2 exceeding those of bc1 considerably in particular for the apolar sorbates lsers developed for the two soot samples suggested that a consistent mechanistic picture of sorption for both samples van der waals interaction and cavity formation expressed by the ee ss and vv terms both contributed towards stronger sorption on soot black carbon for the graphitic bc1 sorbates with h bond acidity as depicted by a 0 were found to exhibit a stronger sorption affinity on soot surface as reflected by a positive a in the lser for the amorphous and oxygenated bc2 sorbates exhibiting h bond basicity as depicted by b 0 would exhibit a weakened affinity for the sorbent as indicated by a substantially negative b analysis of sorption data of benzene and toluene to various black carbons showed that log k bc and log ssa were closely correlated this suggests that the mass based sorption capacity of black carbon with drastically different physical and chemical characteristics may be depicted and predicted by a unified black carbon sorption model with the sorbent specific surface area as a key input variable the applicability of the log k bc log ssa correlation to other organic sorbates or families remains to be explored and documented it may be challenging to extend and apply the log k bc log ssa correlation to environmental black carbon in soils or sediments differentiation of authigenic or allogenic organic matter from black carbon or other condensed carbonaceous materials to derive surface area properties can be difficult with conventional chemical analysis however semi quantitative estimation of sorbent surface properties may be possible with elemental mapping techniques acknowledgements the authors are grateful for the financial support from national science
