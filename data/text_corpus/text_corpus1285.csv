6425,water resources are essential for survival of both the ecosystem and human society in arid regions the impact of precipitation on vegetation cover especially in arid and semiarid areas has received increasing interest although correlation between precipitation and vegetation cover has been reported in arid and semi arid areas with annual precipitation from 50 to 200 mm and from 200 to 400 mm respectively it is unclear whether the same correlation holds in extremely arid regions with annual precipitation less than 50 mm this study used remote sensing data of precipitation and normalized difference vegetation index ndvi to investigate their correlation at different temporal and spatial scales in a typical arid mountain oasis river system located in northwest china the results showed that precipitation and ndvi are not evenly distributed in space in the period 1999 2007 precipitation was declining at a rate of 1 1785 mm year while during 2008 2015 it has increased at a rate of 2 0516 mm year ndvi showed no significant temporal trend in most areas trend slope 0 001 significance 0 05 except for a slight increase in regions where cropland expanded the pearson correlation coefficient between the time series of spatial mean precipitation and ndvi over the whole study area was 0 46 significance 0 01 suggesting strong effects of precipitation on ndvi in the study area the correlation coefficient between precipitation and ndvi varied spatially with the precipitation pattern in space through analysis of phase difference in space and time it was found that ndvi in the lower reaches of the river system was significantly correlated with accumulative precipitation of the current and previous two months in the upper reaches of the system our study shows that the impacts of precipitation on vegetation cover have a clear phase difference in space and that in an extremely arid area antecedent precipitation in an adjacent region upstream has strong influences on vegetation cover downstream thus the spatial distribution and antecedent accumulation of precipitation impacts should be taken into consideration when analyzing vegetation dynamics in arid areas keywords ndvi precipitation arid mountain oasis river basin spatiotemporal pattern 1 introduction drylands occupy nearly 40 of the earth s land surface and are inhabited by more than one third of the total population of the world reynolds et al 2007 in china an arid region with annual precipitation less than 200 mm year and a semi arid region with annual precipitation 200 400 mm year account for 52 5 of the country s land surface area and about 80 of the arable land li et al 2014 water resources are scarce and essential in arid and semi arid areas and lives in extremely arid areas with annual precipitation less than 50 mm year depend on the availability of water source both the ecosystem and human society are fragile due to water stress in arid regions xia et al 2017 zhang et al 2018 the relationship between vegetation cover and precipitation in arid areas remains a topic of great interest in ecohydrological research porporatp et al 2002 newman 2006 fensholt et al 2012 yao et al 2018 vegetation determines the composition and structure of an ecosystem it also ensures the stability of an ecosystem in arid areas and protects human residents from desertification mamat et al 2018 at the same time the survival and growth of vegetation depend directly on water availability zhang et al 2018 although it is agreed that the distribution and growth of plants require groundwater support in arid areas the source of water input is precipitation on a regional scale generally precipitation is quite unevenly distributed in space in arid areas unal et al 2012 xu et al 2016 zhang et al 2012 this causes significant spatial heterogeneity in natural water resources as flow and redistribution of water at a basin scale takes time there may be spatiotemporal phase differences between precipitation and the availability of water to plants thus spatial analysis of the correlation between precipitation and vegetation cover on different time scales is quite important in understanding how vegetation is affected by precipitation in arid areas many studies have shown the relationship between precipitation and vegetation cover at different time and space scales general findings show that the relationship varies with regional climate and vegetation types fang et al 2005 mo et al 2016 zhang et al 2017 piao et al 2003 analyzed interannual vegetation change and its relationship with climate factors and found an increasing trend of vegetation cover in 1982 1999 throughout china the conclusion was that increasing precipitation induced an increase in normalized difference vegetation index ndvi in general however a reversed trend occurred in some wet regions zhang et al 2017 used partial correlation analysis to detect the impact of precipitation on vegetation in the northeast china transect nect taking advantage of the natural precipitation gradient in nect they were able to integrate the spatial and temporal influences of precipitation on vegetation zhao et al 2011 studied ndvi and its relationship to climate factors in a typical dry land region in northwestern china they concluded that a significant correlation exists between ndvi and seasonal precipitation but also pointed out that uncertainties still exist in this relationship due to the complexity of climate change and anthropogenic disturbance in arid areas overall large spatial and temporal heterogeneities of precipitation and vegetation cover have made the problem too hard to be answered in arid mountain oasis river systems the question becomes more difficult because of the complexity of hydrological and ecohydrological processes however understanding the spatial and temporal differences between distributions of precipitation and vegetation change is important in a typical arid mountain oasis system because most precipitation occurs in the mountainous areas while water utilization is concentrated in the oases chen et al 2018b liu and shen 2018 therefore there is an urgent need to clearly understand the relationship between precipitation and vegetation change at different time and space scales spatial analysis of vegetation cover and precipitation is relatively difficult in northwest china due to scarcity of continuous in situ observations and datasets in the past nowadays remote sensing technology provides high quality products to fill the data gap in these areas in the 1970s researchers found that red infrared spectra were correlated to vegetation biophysical characters nouri et al 2014 rouse 1974 proposed ndvi and used it in their study of the great plains owing to its success in description of vegetation vigor and the simplicity of its multispectral ratio calculation ndvi became the most well known and most widely used remote sensing vegetation index many useful vegetation properties have since been found to be well estimated using ndvi e g leaf area index primary productivity fractional vegetation cover etc for the past 40 years ndvi has proven its ability in plant distribution and trend analysis studies fang et al 2005 mo et al 2016 the spatial distribution of precipitation is also difficult to estimate due to its variability ground measurements could in principle be accurate but lack spatial resolution huffman et al 2007 prigent 2010 the utilization of remote sensing precipitation products is increasingly accepted in hydrological and ecological research with the improvement in algorithms and spatial resolution wang et al 2012 meanwhile the opportunity to compare remote sensing vegetation and precipitation products in space and time allows in depth studies to detect the relationship between these two crucial factors through a wider geospatial analysis atkinson et al 2011 bob√©e et al 2012 an arid mountain oasis region is a special ecohydrological system precipitation in such region is highly heterogeneous and does not share the same pattern as vegetation distribution generally rainfall and water availability are relatively high in the mountainous area but cultivated land and human residential areas are mainly in the extremely arid oasis below water to support the lives of people and plants in these areas comes solely from river dependent runoff and groundwater previous studies in arid mountain oasis regions have pointed out that the precipitation is too low to generate runoff in the arid basin liu and shen 2018 shen and chen 2010 the water carried by the river mainly comes from mountainous precipitation the interaction between surface water and groundwater is also notable in such arid mountain oasis regions chiew et al 2014 saft et al 2016 as vegetation growth depends mainly on the depth of water table which relies in turn on water transported by surface runoff thus to understand the phase difference in space and time of precipitation effects it is essential to study the spatiotemporal variations of precipitation and vegetation cover as well as the correlation between them in an arid mountain oasis river basin this study analyzes satellite derived precipitation and ndvi for a relatively long period 1999 2015 in a typical arid mountain oasis river basin in northwest china through time series analysis of precipitation and ndvi trends on interannual and seasonal time scales as well as correlation analysis of precipitation and ndvi on different spatiotemporal scales the major objectives were to determine 1 if precipitation in upper reach mountainous areas had significant impacts on vegetation cover in lower reach oases and 2 if so the time lag for previous precipitation affecting the condition of vegetation in the growing season 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the kaidu konqi river basin kkrb is located on the southern slope of the tienshan mountains and on the northern border of the tarim river basin in xinjiang uyghur autonomous region northwest china it is the lowest tributary of the four sources of the tarim river the area of the basin is 104 394 8 km2 with a wide range of altitude from 779 m to 4796 m fig 1 the basin has a typically continental climate which also shows significant variations between mountainous upper reaches to oasis desert lower reaches the overall annual mean temperature ta and precipitation pa of the region range from 4 2 to 8 9 and from 15 0 mm to 596 8 mm respectively there is a significant spatial variation of pa in the study area mean pa in the upper mountainous area is over 400 mm almost ten times higher than in the lower oasis basin most precipitation occurs in spring and summer accounting for 25 4 and 46 3 of the annual mean respectively the kkrb is a typical mountain oasis river basin the river system is the life giving water resource of the oases in yanqi basin where the precipitation is extremely low the kkrb contains two river systems kaidu river in the upper reach and konqi river in the lower reach with bosten lake in the middle of the basin providing the connection between the two rivers kaidu river originates from tienshan mountain passes through alpine meadows and mountainous valleys and flows into bosten lake konqi river originates from bosten lake flows through the middle reach oases and finally vanishes in the desert about 459 km from the river source the main water source of kaidu river is meltwater while the water source of konqi river is manipulated by an artificial sluice gate at the southwest edge of bosten lake the channel connecting kaidu konqi river and tarim river was once broken due to river degradation in the year 2000 an ecological water transportation project was started to maintain the riparian ecosystem along the lower reach of the tarim river the kaidu konqi river is therefore needed to provide water for agriculture in the oases and also for the ecological water sustainability of the desert river system the major vegetation types in the basin are grassland and cropland but these are distributed very differently in the two sub basins fig 1 2 4 in the upper reach mountainous areas most of the land is covered by grassland accounting for 43 7 of the total area while glaciers account for 13 7 downstream from dashankou into the yanqi basin the vegetation cover changes mainly into cropland from 6 3 to 9 2 during 1995 2015 fig 1 2 4 which is irrigated by groundwater in the konqi river basin the major vegetation type is irrigated oasis cropland in the upper reaches most of the lower reach area is covered by desert apart from a band of vegetation along the river overall the vegetation cover declines from northwest to southeast in the study area and the major vegetation type changes from natural grassland to oasis cropland and desert river riparian vegetation 2 2 data 2 2 1 precipitation data monthly precipitation from remote sensing product of the tropical rainfall measuring mission was used in this study trmm 3b43 v7 covering the period from 1999 to 2015 it has been shown that trmm precipitation is comparable to rain gauged data and may even be more accurate in remote regions with scarce monitoring stations huffman et al 2007 duan and bastiaanssen 2013 some previous studies have successfully used the trmm dataset to analyze the relationship between vegetation cover and precipitation dubey and mehta 2016 zeng et al 2013 considering its temporal and spatial resolutions and applicability in ecohydrology the trmm dataset was adopted to analyze the precipitation properties in this study trmm 3b43 is a level 3 product in which space time grids represent average rates of rainfall with horizontal spatial resolution of 0 25 the trmm 3b43 was calibrated using other satellite rainfall data and also rain gauge data through multiple independent precipitation estimates the algorithm of 3b43 produced the best estimated precipitation rate in mm hr with lowest root mean square rms the newest version 7 of the dataset was used in this study it has some improvements in fine scale patterns of precipitation during the period 2000 2010 more details of the product can be found at https pmm nasa gov the original data had a temporal resolution of three hours and were summed to provide daily and monthly precipitation 2 2 2 vegetation data we used ndvi to describe vegetation cover since it has been shown to be well correlated with vegetation cover gutman and ignatov 1998 an et al 2015 and is commonly used for analyzing the response of vegetation to climate change in ecohydrological studies wang et al 2003 piao et al 2006 georganos et al 2017 there are several well known and widely used ndvi data products including avhrr advanced very high resolution radiometer gimms global inventory modelling and mapping studies nasa s modis the syst√®me probatoire d observation de la terre vegetation spot vgt etc gimms ndvi product is a 15 day composite dataset with spatial resolution of 8 km available from 1982 to the present time modis vegetation index products offer 16 day interval and monthly ndvi datasets on different spatial resolution 250 m 500 m 1 km and 0 05 since 2000 spot vgt ndvi is a 10 day composite dataset with 1 km spatial resolution from 1999 to present time previous studies have compared the consistency and differences of these ndvi datasets and suggested that modis and spot vgt ndvi products have some advantages because of their algorithm specially designed for vegetation monitoring fensholt et al 2009 beck et al 2011 an et al 2015 although gimms ndvi covers the longest period modis and spot vgt ndvi have finer resolution and have been shown to be relatively more reliable in arid and semi arid areas in northern china an et al 2015 considering the spatial resolution and time period spot vgt s10 ndvi data was chosen for this study covering the period from 1999 to 2015 with a spatial resolution of 1 km geometrical processing radiometric corrections atmospheric corrections synthesis composition and product formatting are conducted in the spot image processing center to guarantee the product quality and consistence the data were downloaded from the vgt data archive monthly values of ndvi were determined by averaging the 10 day spot ndvi product 2 2 3 land use data land use data were downloaded from the resource and environment data cloud platform http www resdc cn the spatial resolution of the data is 1 km images of 1995 2005 and 2015 were used in this study to show the change of land use type the product was generated based on landsat tm etm image through supervised classification and manual visual revision the land use was classified into six major types cultivated land forestland grassland waters construction land and unused land twenty five sub classifications were then added the description of the land use classification system can be found on the website mentioned above 2 3 statistical analysis a trend analysis was first conducted to describe the changes in ndvi and precipitation to determine whether the two variables had the same trends during the period to analyze the correlation between ndvi and precipitation on different time and space scales pearson correlation analysis was applied fig s1 spatial correlation and temporal correlation were carried out separately the specific methods used in this study are described in detail below 2 4 mann kendall test the mann kendall test is a non parametric test which means that no prior assumptions are needed about the statistical distributions of data the normalized statistic z is mainly used for testing trend and significance of the time series it is calculated as z s 1 v a r s s 0 0 s 0 s 1 var s s 0 s i 2 n j 1 i 1 s i g n x i x j s i g n x i x j 1 x i x j 0 0 x i x j 0 1 x i x j 0 v a r s n n 1 2 n 5 k 1 m t k t k 1 2 t k 5 18 where n is the number of data points in the time series x i and x j are data values at time i and j for all i j respectively x stands for precipitation or ndvi in this study m is the number of tied groups which is a group of sample data with the same value t k presents the number of data points in the k th group the null hypothesis h 0 is that no trend in the tested series is rejected when z z 1 1 Œ± where Œ± is the statistical significance the sign of z shows the trend of the time series it is positive for an increasing trend and negative for a decreasing trend z obeys the normal distribution so that the critical value is 1 96 at a 5 significance level and 2 576 at a 1 significance level according to the t test before conducting the mann kendall test the time series datasets were processed with the method suggested by yue et al 2002 to remove the effect of autocorrelation 2 5 theil sen linear regression the time series trend was analyzed using theil sen linear regression the theil sen method is a robust linear regression method based on non parametric statistics the estimator of theil sen regression is defined as the median of the slopes of all lines through pairs of points Œ≤ m e d i a n x j x i j i where x i and x j are data values at time i and j for all i j respectively x stands for precipitation or ndvi in this study a time series shows an increasing trend when Œ≤ 0 otherwise it shows a decreasing trend the theil sen median slope estimator is efficiently calculated but is relatively insensitive to outliers it has a breakdown point of 1 1 2 29 3 meaning that it can tolerate arbitrary corruption of up to 29 3 of the input data points without degradation of its accuracy comparison of different linear regression models has shown that the theil sen method has substantial advantages in cases with small sample size 2 6 pearson correlation analysis pearson correlation analysis was conducted to detect the relationship between precipitation and ndvi three correlation coefficients were defined the time series pearson coefficient r t the spatial pearson coefficient r s and the time series pearson coefficient of spatial mean r ts r t was defined as the correlation coefficient between precipitation and ndvi time series data r t i j cov p i j n d v i i j œÉ p i j œÉ n d v i i j where r t i j is the time series pearson in grid i j p i j and n d v i i j represent the precipitation and ndvi time series data in grid i j respectively cov is covariance and œÉ is the standard deviation of the variables r s was defined as the correlation coefficient between precipitation and ndvi data on space grid r s k c o v p k n d v i k œÉ p k œÉ n d v i k where r s k is the spatial pearson in year k p k and n d v i k represent the all the precipitation and ndvi data of each grid in year k respectively r ts was defined as the time series pearson r of monthly spatial mean precipitation and ndvi r ts c o v p ndvi œÉ p œÉ ndvi where p and ndvi represent the sets of monthly spatial mean precipitation and ndvi respectively i e p p jan p feb p dec p jan stands for the spatial mean precipitation in january for the whole studied period 1999 2015 2 7 design of statistical experiments to unify the spatial resolution of trmm precipitation and spot vgt ndvi bilinear resampling was conducted using arcgis 10 2 environmental systems research institute inc usa the time series statistics was computed in every spatial grid annual mean values and monthly data were analyzed the statistical results were classified according to levels of precipitation the spatial mean was computed as the average of values of all grids spatial correlation analysis was carried out for paired data at each grid all the statistical analyses were carried out using the statistical functions module scipy stats in python 2 7 https www python org 3 results 3 1 spatiotemporal variation of precipitation in kkrb mean annual precipitation pa is distributed quite unevenly in the basin fig 2 1 areas with precipitation over 400 mm occupy only 2 1 of the basin and are located mainly in the western mountainous region most of the areas in the middle and lower reaches of the basin are arid with pa 100 mm making up 49 7 of the total area a region with apparently high pa around bosten lake may be the result of an error in the trmm data algorithm which has a weakness near surface water bodies chen et al 2018a the trend test showed that pa in most areas decreased during 1999 2015 a region covering 34 2 of the studied region has a trend slope Œ≤ lower than 2 fig 2 2 some positive values of Œ≤ were sparsely located in the mountains in the west because of the suspected trmm error near lakes the large positive Œ≤ values around bosten lake may not be reliable but may still reflect a real trend chen et al 2018a b the spatial mean pa over the whole period decreased at a rate of 1 1785 mm year Œ≤ p a 1 1785 fig 2 3 no significant abrupt change point was detected by the mann kendall test but quadratic fitting showed an upward parabola with the lowest point in 2008 pa 0 3069 year2 1232 6 year 1e06 the pa showed a minor reversal in trend between the periods 1999 2007 and 2008 2015 during the whole period 1999 2007 Œ≤ p a was 1 6864 mm year during 2008 2015 it became 2 0516 mm year the trend test was also performed on seasonal precipitation and the results showed a negative trend in spring and summer and a positive trend in autumn and winter table s1 estimating the trend of pa frequency at different levels the analysis suggested that the pa 250 mm year group increased the most the pa 350 and pa 400 mm year groups decreased the most table s2 this shows that more places became semi arid while the semi wet areas shrank 3 2 spatiotemporal vegetation change in kkrb the spatial mean ndvi during 1999 2015 in kkrb was only 0 10 but ranged from 0 to 0 4 with an uneven spatial distribution more than 40 of the study area had ndvi lower than 0 05 as shown in fig 3 1 fig 3 1 also shows that the mountainous areas in upper kaidu river areas around bosten lake and along upper the konqi river had higher ndvi than elsewhere in the lower reach of the east basin ndvi was almost 0 according to fig 1 areas with relatively high ndvi were mainly grassland and cropland ndvi in most parts of the basin showed no significant trend more than 80 of the study area showed a slightly increasing rate less than 0 005 year 1 fig 3 2 it can be seen that areas with a high increasing rate are located mainly along the upper to middle konqi river and around the north to west rim of bosten lake where the major vegetation type was cropland the overall trend slope of ndvi was only 0 001 significance 0 05 fig 3 3 but if seasonal changes are taken into consideration ndvi showed a significant increasing trend in summer Œ≤ 0 0020 significance 0 01 and autumn Œ≤ 0 0007 significance 0 01 table s3 such seasonal trends show that vegetation condition was improving during the growing season 3 3 correlation between precipitation and ndvi fig 4 shows the relationship between r t and pa the spatial pattern of r t between precipitation and ndvi was similar to the spatial pattern of pa there was a fast growing rate of r t when pa 60 mm year where the mean r t was 0 47 when pa 60 mm year r t showed a very slight declining trend with pa the mean values of r t were 0 36 0 32 0 37 at pa equal to 100 200 and 300 mm year respectively the increasing trend at pa 350 mm year may be due to the trmm data error around the lake which shows as abnormally high values in the lake area fig 2 the spatial pearson coefficient r s of pa and mean ndvi throughout the whole period was 0 46 with significance 0 01 table 1 shows r s of each year during 1999 2015 there is a slightly decreasing trend throughout the period Œ≤ 0 0067 significance 0 99 on a monthly timescale the temporal pattern of r s between precipitation and ndvi showed a unimodal trend throughout the year table 2 from december to march the value of r s was negative and the absolute values were from small to large then back to small the smallest r s value was in january in other months r s values were positive and the variation was in the same pattern with the peak value appearing in july 3 4 impact of spatiotemporal phase differences of precipitation on vegetation change the r s between ndvi and pa in the same year r s between ndvi and pa of the previous year and r s between ndvi and accumulated pa the sum of precipitation in the current year and the previous year are shown in fig 5 1 the results show no obvious difference in trend between these three values of r s suggesting that a time lag effect may not exist on an interannual scale both the seasonality of precipitation and ndvi showed a mono peak pattern annually fig 5 2 monthly precipitation reached a maximum value in july one month prior to the peak monthly mean of ndvi the pearson r of the time series of monthly spatial mean precipitation and monthly mean ndvi r ts was 0 89 using the original time series but was improved to 0 97 by shifting the monthly precipitation to give a one month phase difference the effect of accumulative precipitation was also detected by correlation analysis the r ts values between ndvi and the accumulated precipitation of two month three month and four month were 0 98 0 99 and 0 91 respectively these results suggested that the sum of precipitation in the current month and the previous two months affected ndvi the most to detect the effects of spatiotemporal phase difference in precipitation the kkrb was divided into two regions based on the 200 mm year pa boundary fig s2 areas with pa 200 mm year were mainly located in the northwest upper reach mountainous region while areas with pa 200 mm year were in the middle to lower reaches correlation analysis was undertaken between spatial mean ndvi in areas with pa 200 mm year and different precipitation patterns table 3 it was seen that antecedent accumulative precipitation in the upper reach area correlated most significantly with ndvi in the lower reach arid area 4 discussion 4 1 the properties of spatial relationships between precipitation and vegetation in an arid mountain oasis river basin our results show significant positive correlation between precipitation and ndvi spatially and the correlation varies with the spatial pattern of mean annual precipitation pa this is consistent with similar research in arid areas camberlin et al 2007 georganos et al 2017 zhang et al 2017 previous studies have suggested confidence in the strength of correlation between precipitation and ndvi when pa ranges from 160 to 600 mm year camberlin et al 2007 zhang et al 2017 this seems reasonable as precipitation may not be a control factor for vegetation growth in wet areas in this study the effect of pa began to weaken when pa was less than 60 mm year in such extreme areas the land is little vegetated which may lead to errors in ndvi detected by satellite camberlin et al 2007 this may be a possible reason for the weak correlation between ndvi and precipitation in areas with pa 60 mm year however the correlation analysis of spatial grid data also showed significant results in areas with low ndvi values in our study fig s3 therefore we argue that the weak correlation between precipitation and ndvi in the extreme arid region in our study is because precipitation was too small to support vegetation growth generally the natural water sources for vegetation are precipitation surface runoff and groundwater hao et al 2010 lamontagne et al 2005 yet since the precipitation is insufficient for vegetation growth and the access to surface water is quite limited in arid areas it is widely acknowledged that vegetation growth in such region depends critically on groundwater availability doble et al 2006 naumburg et al 2005 in arid areas the water table is firmly linked to river and lake water tables liu et al 2012 from a holistic point of view at basin scale runoff in lower reaches comes from the upper reach which correlates significantly with precipitation thus precipitation in the upper reach may have great effects on vegetation growth in lower reaches previous works have focused on the spatial patterns of precipitation and ndvi trying to describe the differences in their spatial relationships cui et al 2018 piao et al 2003 xu et al 2012 zhang et al 2017 zhao et al 2011 yet these studies did not clarify whether precipitation in an adjacent region would also influence vegetation cover in the local area especially in an arid mountain oasis river system our results support the hypothesis that precipitation in upper reach area influences on the vegetation growth in lower reach in arid river basins 4 2 the time lag effects of precipitation on vegetation in an arid mountain oasis river basin many studies have verified that precipitation antecedent to the growing season affects vegetation growth zeng et al 2013 analyzed the interannual changes of ndvi based on gimms ndvi3g data set and suggested that precipitation in the current and previous wet season were well correlated to ndvi in herbaceous vegetation papagiannopoulou et al 2017 studied the worldwide multi decadal satellite data and also found a prolonged effect of precipitation on vegetation dynamics in arid regions they point out that plants are sensitive to precipitation that occurred three months earlier zhao et al 2011 suggested that precipitation in the preceding winter would be positively correlated with ndvi variation there are different reasons for a time lag between precipitation and vegetation growth one is that soil moisture memory is long term mo et al 2016 have found that soil water storage during the previous non growing season had the same spatial pattern as vegetation cover change in a semi arid river basin based on annual water balance another reason is the nonlinear and delayed response of vegetation to precipitation change based on in situ observations wolf et al 2013 proved the different strategies of vegetation types dealing with water limited conditions which reflects the different response period of vegetation to water condition change a further possible reason is the residence time of water flowing through different regions helton et al 2014 mcdonnell and beven 2014 since it has been shown that there is a spatial phase difference between precipitation and ndvi dynamics different thresholds of the time lag effect were mentioned due to the specific conditions of climate vegetation and soil type for different studies zhang et al 2017 results in this study show a strong correlation between accumulated precipitation in the previous two months in upper reaches and ndvi in lower reaches in the arid mountain oasis river basin the cumulative effect shows the influence of soil moisture storage in this study effects of precipitation in the previous two months were significant but the effect of precipitation in the antecedent year was not suggesting that soil moisture memory is shorter than seasonal scale in the study area because the soil type in our study area is mostly sand in the lower reaches water flows fast and cannot be held long in the soil unsaturated zone moreover precipitation in upper mountainous areas converts quickly to river runoff flowing downwards and replenishing groundwater which is then pumped by plant roots due to the residence time of water flow in river channel lake and soil it is reasonable for water to take two month to flow from upper areas to lower reaches where it is used by vegetation 4 3 the impact of climate change and human activities and data uncertainties although temperature effects on ndvi were not analyzed directly in this study temperature certainly affects vegetation dynamics according to conclusions from other similar studies fang et al 2005 yao et al 2018 spatial analysis found only weak correlation between ndvi and temperature in this area zhao et al 2011 however the effects of temperature were critical in snow and glacier melting chen et al 2018a b as mentioned before runoff in rivers originating from the mountains in a mountain oasis system depends on meltwater from snow and glaciers hence the relationship between temperature and snow rate glacier line could also be important to ndvi change and this deserves further study as population grows the effect of anthropogenic disturbances becomes significant especially the expansion of agricultural activities nearly 90 of water resources are used to support irrigation in the study area shen et al 2013 thus the change of cropland is directly associated with water resource availability and sustainability it has been shown in this study that the area of cropland grew by 46 4 during the studied period fig 1 2 4 table s4 mostly changing from natural sparse grassland or bare land this contributed to the increasing trend of ndvi in low precipitation regions fig 3 2 although results have shown that this change was still controlled by precipitation because cropland is generally irrigated by groundwater future work should pay more attention to the human induced land cover change for better understanding of the spatiotemporal pattern of vegetation change the spot ndvi and trmm precipitation datasets used in this study have been widely applied in related research for describing trends in regional climate and vegetation dynamics an et al 2015 fensholt et al 2009 wang et al 2012 however these data inevitably contain uncertainties due to systematic and random errors from the satellite equipment and data process algorithms prigent 2010 mo et al 2016 in addition the datasets were pre processed at specific time and space scales e g downscaling spatial resolution and or upscaling temporal resolution before the analyses undertaken in this study which may lead to information loss and additional uncertainties moreover only 17 years of data were analyzed in this study due to the availability of the remote sensing products and this could also be a limitation of this study as shown in fig 2 precipitation trends would change if data were extracted in different time periods therefore more datasets should be explored and compared with in situ observations to make the conclusions robust even though we are confident with the correlation analyses and trends of the final results 5 conclusion based on satellite derived precipitation and ndvi data in a typical mountain oasis in northwest china the spatiotemporal variations of precipitation and vegetation cover and their relationships have been revealed 1 both precipitation and ndvi are unevenly distributed in the basin with relatively high values in the northwest and very low values in the southeast overall precipitation had a general decreasing trend in time but it increased at a faster rate after 2008 ndvi showed no trend in most areas except for a significant change in spring and summer due to expanded cropland 2 most of the area in the basin shows a strong positive correlation between precipitation and ndvi at different temporal and spatial scales and the correlation shows a declining trend during the studied period the spatial pattern of correlation coefficient was determined by the spatial precipitation pattern 3 in this arid mountain oasis river basin the strongest correlation was found between the accumulated precipitation in the previous two months i e the current month and one previous month in the upper reach and ndvi in the lower reach our study has shown a spatiotemporal phase difference in the effect of precipitation on vegetation cover in an arid mountain oasis river basin suggesting that

6425,water resources are essential for survival of both the ecosystem and human society in arid regions the impact of precipitation on vegetation cover especially in arid and semiarid areas has received increasing interest although correlation between precipitation and vegetation cover has been reported in arid and semi arid areas with annual precipitation from 50 to 200 mm and from 200 to 400 mm respectively it is unclear whether the same correlation holds in extremely arid regions with annual precipitation less than 50 mm this study used remote sensing data of precipitation and normalized difference vegetation index ndvi to investigate their correlation at different temporal and spatial scales in a typical arid mountain oasis river system located in northwest china the results showed that precipitation and ndvi are not evenly distributed in space in the period 1999 2007 precipitation was declining at a rate of 1 1785 mm year while during 2008 2015 it has increased at a rate of 2 0516 mm year ndvi showed no significant temporal trend in most areas trend slope 0 001 significance 0 05 except for a slight increase in regions where cropland expanded the pearson correlation coefficient between the time series of spatial mean precipitation and ndvi over the whole study area was 0 46 significance 0 01 suggesting strong effects of precipitation on ndvi in the study area the correlation coefficient between precipitation and ndvi varied spatially with the precipitation pattern in space through analysis of phase difference in space and time it was found that ndvi in the lower reaches of the river system was significantly correlated with accumulative precipitation of the current and previous two months in the upper reaches of the system our study shows that the impacts of precipitation on vegetation cover have a clear phase difference in space and that in an extremely arid area antecedent precipitation in an adjacent region upstream has strong influences on vegetation cover downstream thus the spatial distribution and antecedent accumulation of precipitation impacts should be taken into consideration when analyzing vegetation dynamics in arid areas keywords ndvi precipitation arid mountain oasis river basin spatiotemporal pattern 1 introduction drylands occupy nearly 40 of the earth s land surface and are inhabited by more than one third of the total population of the world reynolds et al 2007 in china an arid region with annual precipitation less than 200 mm year and a semi arid region with annual precipitation 200 400 mm year account for 52 5 of the country s land surface area and about 80 of the arable land li et al 2014 water resources are scarce and essential in arid and semi arid areas and lives in extremely arid areas with annual precipitation less than 50 mm year depend on the availability of water source both the ecosystem and human society are fragile due to water stress in arid regions xia et al 2017 zhang et al 2018 the relationship between vegetation cover and precipitation in arid areas remains a topic of great interest in ecohydrological research porporatp et al 2002 newman 2006 fensholt et al 2012 yao et al 2018 vegetation determines the composition and structure of an ecosystem it also ensures the stability of an ecosystem in arid areas and protects human residents from desertification mamat et al 2018 at the same time the survival and growth of vegetation depend directly on water availability zhang et al 2018 although it is agreed that the distribution and growth of plants require groundwater support in arid areas the source of water input is precipitation on a regional scale generally precipitation is quite unevenly distributed in space in arid areas unal et al 2012 xu et al 2016 zhang et al 2012 this causes significant spatial heterogeneity in natural water resources as flow and redistribution of water at a basin scale takes time there may be spatiotemporal phase differences between precipitation and the availability of water to plants thus spatial analysis of the correlation between precipitation and vegetation cover on different time scales is quite important in understanding how vegetation is affected by precipitation in arid areas many studies have shown the relationship between precipitation and vegetation cover at different time and space scales general findings show that the relationship varies with regional climate and vegetation types fang et al 2005 mo et al 2016 zhang et al 2017 piao et al 2003 analyzed interannual vegetation change and its relationship with climate factors and found an increasing trend of vegetation cover in 1982 1999 throughout china the conclusion was that increasing precipitation induced an increase in normalized difference vegetation index ndvi in general however a reversed trend occurred in some wet regions zhang et al 2017 used partial correlation analysis to detect the impact of precipitation on vegetation in the northeast china transect nect taking advantage of the natural precipitation gradient in nect they were able to integrate the spatial and temporal influences of precipitation on vegetation zhao et al 2011 studied ndvi and its relationship to climate factors in a typical dry land region in northwestern china they concluded that a significant correlation exists between ndvi and seasonal precipitation but also pointed out that uncertainties still exist in this relationship due to the complexity of climate change and anthropogenic disturbance in arid areas overall large spatial and temporal heterogeneities of precipitation and vegetation cover have made the problem too hard to be answered in arid mountain oasis river systems the question becomes more difficult because of the complexity of hydrological and ecohydrological processes however understanding the spatial and temporal differences between distributions of precipitation and vegetation change is important in a typical arid mountain oasis system because most precipitation occurs in the mountainous areas while water utilization is concentrated in the oases chen et al 2018b liu and shen 2018 therefore there is an urgent need to clearly understand the relationship between precipitation and vegetation change at different time and space scales spatial analysis of vegetation cover and precipitation is relatively difficult in northwest china due to scarcity of continuous in situ observations and datasets in the past nowadays remote sensing technology provides high quality products to fill the data gap in these areas in the 1970s researchers found that red infrared spectra were correlated to vegetation biophysical characters nouri et al 2014 rouse 1974 proposed ndvi and used it in their study of the great plains owing to its success in description of vegetation vigor and the simplicity of its multispectral ratio calculation ndvi became the most well known and most widely used remote sensing vegetation index many useful vegetation properties have since been found to be well estimated using ndvi e g leaf area index primary productivity fractional vegetation cover etc for the past 40 years ndvi has proven its ability in plant distribution and trend analysis studies fang et al 2005 mo et al 2016 the spatial distribution of precipitation is also difficult to estimate due to its variability ground measurements could in principle be accurate but lack spatial resolution huffman et al 2007 prigent 2010 the utilization of remote sensing precipitation products is increasingly accepted in hydrological and ecological research with the improvement in algorithms and spatial resolution wang et al 2012 meanwhile the opportunity to compare remote sensing vegetation and precipitation products in space and time allows in depth studies to detect the relationship between these two crucial factors through a wider geospatial analysis atkinson et al 2011 bob√©e et al 2012 an arid mountain oasis region is a special ecohydrological system precipitation in such region is highly heterogeneous and does not share the same pattern as vegetation distribution generally rainfall and water availability are relatively high in the mountainous area but cultivated land and human residential areas are mainly in the extremely arid oasis below water to support the lives of people and plants in these areas comes solely from river dependent runoff and groundwater previous studies in arid mountain oasis regions have pointed out that the precipitation is too low to generate runoff in the arid basin liu and shen 2018 shen and chen 2010 the water carried by the river mainly comes from mountainous precipitation the interaction between surface water and groundwater is also notable in such arid mountain oasis regions chiew et al 2014 saft et al 2016 as vegetation growth depends mainly on the depth of water table which relies in turn on water transported by surface runoff thus to understand the phase difference in space and time of precipitation effects it is essential to study the spatiotemporal variations of precipitation and vegetation cover as well as the correlation between them in an arid mountain oasis river basin this study analyzes satellite derived precipitation and ndvi for a relatively long period 1999 2015 in a typical arid mountain oasis river basin in northwest china through time series analysis of precipitation and ndvi trends on interannual and seasonal time scales as well as correlation analysis of precipitation and ndvi on different spatiotemporal scales the major objectives were to determine 1 if precipitation in upper reach mountainous areas had significant impacts on vegetation cover in lower reach oases and 2 if so the time lag for previous precipitation affecting the condition of vegetation in the growing season 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the kaidu konqi river basin kkrb is located on the southern slope of the tienshan mountains and on the northern border of the tarim river basin in xinjiang uyghur autonomous region northwest china it is the lowest tributary of the four sources of the tarim river the area of the basin is 104 394 8 km2 with a wide range of altitude from 779 m to 4796 m fig 1 the basin has a typically continental climate which also shows significant variations between mountainous upper reaches to oasis desert lower reaches the overall annual mean temperature ta and precipitation pa of the region range from 4 2 to 8 9 and from 15 0 mm to 596 8 mm respectively there is a significant spatial variation of pa in the study area mean pa in the upper mountainous area is over 400 mm almost ten times higher than in the lower oasis basin most precipitation occurs in spring and summer accounting for 25 4 and 46 3 of the annual mean respectively the kkrb is a typical mountain oasis river basin the river system is the life giving water resource of the oases in yanqi basin where the precipitation is extremely low the kkrb contains two river systems kaidu river in the upper reach and konqi river in the lower reach with bosten lake in the middle of the basin providing the connection between the two rivers kaidu river originates from tienshan mountain passes through alpine meadows and mountainous valleys and flows into bosten lake konqi river originates from bosten lake flows through the middle reach oases and finally vanishes in the desert about 459 km from the river source the main water source of kaidu river is meltwater while the water source of konqi river is manipulated by an artificial sluice gate at the southwest edge of bosten lake the channel connecting kaidu konqi river and tarim river was once broken due to river degradation in the year 2000 an ecological water transportation project was started to maintain the riparian ecosystem along the lower reach of the tarim river the kaidu konqi river is therefore needed to provide water for agriculture in the oases and also for the ecological water sustainability of the desert river system the major vegetation types in the basin are grassland and cropland but these are distributed very differently in the two sub basins fig 1 2 4 in the upper reach mountainous areas most of the land is covered by grassland accounting for 43 7 of the total area while glaciers account for 13 7 downstream from dashankou into the yanqi basin the vegetation cover changes mainly into cropland from 6 3 to 9 2 during 1995 2015 fig 1 2 4 which is irrigated by groundwater in the konqi river basin the major vegetation type is irrigated oasis cropland in the upper reaches most of the lower reach area is covered by desert apart from a band of vegetation along the river overall the vegetation cover declines from northwest to southeast in the study area and the major vegetation type changes from natural grassland to oasis cropland and desert river riparian vegetation 2 2 data 2 2 1 precipitation data monthly precipitation from remote sensing product of the tropical rainfall measuring mission was used in this study trmm 3b43 v7 covering the period from 1999 to 2015 it has been shown that trmm precipitation is comparable to rain gauged data and may even be more accurate in remote regions with scarce monitoring stations huffman et al 2007 duan and bastiaanssen 2013 some previous studies have successfully used the trmm dataset to analyze the relationship between vegetation cover and precipitation dubey and mehta 2016 zeng et al 2013 considering its temporal and spatial resolutions and applicability in ecohydrology the trmm dataset was adopted to analyze the precipitation properties in this study trmm 3b43 is a level 3 product in which space time grids represent average rates of rainfall with horizontal spatial resolution of 0 25 the trmm 3b43 was calibrated using other satellite rainfall data and also rain gauge data through multiple independent precipitation estimates the algorithm of 3b43 produced the best estimated precipitation rate in mm hr with lowest root mean square rms the newest version 7 of the dataset was used in this study it has some improvements in fine scale patterns of precipitation during the period 2000 2010 more details of the product can be found at https pmm nasa gov the original data had a temporal resolution of three hours and were summed to provide daily and monthly precipitation 2 2 2 vegetation data we used ndvi to describe vegetation cover since it has been shown to be well correlated with vegetation cover gutman and ignatov 1998 an et al 2015 and is commonly used for analyzing the response of vegetation to climate change in ecohydrological studies wang et al 2003 piao et al 2006 georganos et al 2017 there are several well known and widely used ndvi data products including avhrr advanced very high resolution radiometer gimms global inventory modelling and mapping studies nasa s modis the syst√®me probatoire d observation de la terre vegetation spot vgt etc gimms ndvi product is a 15 day composite dataset with spatial resolution of 8 km available from 1982 to the present time modis vegetation index products offer 16 day interval and monthly ndvi datasets on different spatial resolution 250 m 500 m 1 km and 0 05 since 2000 spot vgt ndvi is a 10 day composite dataset with 1 km spatial resolution from 1999 to present time previous studies have compared the consistency and differences of these ndvi datasets and suggested that modis and spot vgt ndvi products have some advantages because of their algorithm specially designed for vegetation monitoring fensholt et al 2009 beck et al 2011 an et al 2015 although gimms ndvi covers the longest period modis and spot vgt ndvi have finer resolution and have been shown to be relatively more reliable in arid and semi arid areas in northern china an et al 2015 considering the spatial resolution and time period spot vgt s10 ndvi data was chosen for this study covering the period from 1999 to 2015 with a spatial resolution of 1 km geometrical processing radiometric corrections atmospheric corrections synthesis composition and product formatting are conducted in the spot image processing center to guarantee the product quality and consistence the data were downloaded from the vgt data archive monthly values of ndvi were determined by averaging the 10 day spot ndvi product 2 2 3 land use data land use data were downloaded from the resource and environment data cloud platform http www resdc cn the spatial resolution of the data is 1 km images of 1995 2005 and 2015 were used in this study to show the change of land use type the product was generated based on landsat tm etm image through supervised classification and manual visual revision the land use was classified into six major types cultivated land forestland grassland waters construction land and unused land twenty five sub classifications were then added the description of the land use classification system can be found on the website mentioned above 2 3 statistical analysis a trend analysis was first conducted to describe the changes in ndvi and precipitation to determine whether the two variables had the same trends during the period to analyze the correlation between ndvi and precipitation on different time and space scales pearson correlation analysis was applied fig s1 spatial correlation and temporal correlation were carried out separately the specific methods used in this study are described in detail below 2 4 mann kendall test the mann kendall test is a non parametric test which means that no prior assumptions are needed about the statistical distributions of data the normalized statistic z is mainly used for testing trend and significance of the time series it is calculated as z s 1 v a r s s 0 0 s 0 s 1 var s s 0 s i 2 n j 1 i 1 s i g n x i x j s i g n x i x j 1 x i x j 0 0 x i x j 0 1 x i x j 0 v a r s n n 1 2 n 5 k 1 m t k t k 1 2 t k 5 18 where n is the number of data points in the time series x i and x j are data values at time i and j for all i j respectively x stands for precipitation or ndvi in this study m is the number of tied groups which is a group of sample data with the same value t k presents the number of data points in the k th group the null hypothesis h 0 is that no trend in the tested series is rejected when z z 1 1 Œ± where Œ± is the statistical significance the sign of z shows the trend of the time series it is positive for an increasing trend and negative for a decreasing trend z obeys the normal distribution so that the critical value is 1 96 at a 5 significance level and 2 576 at a 1 significance level according to the t test before conducting the mann kendall test the time series datasets were processed with the method suggested by yue et al 2002 to remove the effect of autocorrelation 2 5 theil sen linear regression the time series trend was analyzed using theil sen linear regression the theil sen method is a robust linear regression method based on non parametric statistics the estimator of theil sen regression is defined as the median of the slopes of all lines through pairs of points Œ≤ m e d i a n x j x i j i where x i and x j are data values at time i and j for all i j respectively x stands for precipitation or ndvi in this study a time series shows an increasing trend when Œ≤ 0 otherwise it shows a decreasing trend the theil sen median slope estimator is efficiently calculated but is relatively insensitive to outliers it has a breakdown point of 1 1 2 29 3 meaning that it can tolerate arbitrary corruption of up to 29 3 of the input data points without degradation of its accuracy comparison of different linear regression models has shown that the theil sen method has substantial advantages in cases with small sample size 2 6 pearson correlation analysis pearson correlation analysis was conducted to detect the relationship between precipitation and ndvi three correlation coefficients were defined the time series pearson coefficient r t the spatial pearson coefficient r s and the time series pearson coefficient of spatial mean r ts r t was defined as the correlation coefficient between precipitation and ndvi time series data r t i j cov p i j n d v i i j œÉ p i j œÉ n d v i i j where r t i j is the time series pearson in grid i j p i j and n d v i i j represent the precipitation and ndvi time series data in grid i j respectively cov is covariance and œÉ is the standard deviation of the variables r s was defined as the correlation coefficient between precipitation and ndvi data on space grid r s k c o v p k n d v i k œÉ p k œÉ n d v i k where r s k is the spatial pearson in year k p k and n d v i k represent the all the precipitation and ndvi data of each grid in year k respectively r ts was defined as the time series pearson r of monthly spatial mean precipitation and ndvi r ts c o v p ndvi œÉ p œÉ ndvi where p and ndvi represent the sets of monthly spatial mean precipitation and ndvi respectively i e p p jan p feb p dec p jan stands for the spatial mean precipitation in january for the whole studied period 1999 2015 2 7 design of statistical experiments to unify the spatial resolution of trmm precipitation and spot vgt ndvi bilinear resampling was conducted using arcgis 10 2 environmental systems research institute inc usa the time series statistics was computed in every spatial grid annual mean values and monthly data were analyzed the statistical results were classified according to levels of precipitation the spatial mean was computed as the average of values of all grids spatial correlation analysis was carried out for paired data at each grid all the statistical analyses were carried out using the statistical functions module scipy stats in python 2 7 https www python org 3 results 3 1 spatiotemporal variation of precipitation in kkrb mean annual precipitation pa is distributed quite unevenly in the basin fig 2 1 areas with precipitation over 400 mm occupy only 2 1 of the basin and are located mainly in the western mountainous region most of the areas in the middle and lower reaches of the basin are arid with pa 100 mm making up 49 7 of the total area a region with apparently high pa around bosten lake may be the result of an error in the trmm data algorithm which has a weakness near surface water bodies chen et al 2018a the trend test showed that pa in most areas decreased during 1999 2015 a region covering 34 2 of the studied region has a trend slope Œ≤ lower than 2 fig 2 2 some positive values of Œ≤ were sparsely located in the mountains in the west because of the suspected trmm error near lakes the large positive Œ≤ values around bosten lake may not be reliable but may still reflect a real trend chen et al 2018a b the spatial mean pa over the whole period decreased at a rate of 1 1785 mm year Œ≤ p a 1 1785 fig 2 3 no significant abrupt change point was detected by the mann kendall test but quadratic fitting showed an upward parabola with the lowest point in 2008 pa 0 3069 year2 1232 6 year 1e06 the pa showed a minor reversal in trend between the periods 1999 2007 and 2008 2015 during the whole period 1999 2007 Œ≤ p a was 1 6864 mm year during 2008 2015 it became 2 0516 mm year the trend test was also performed on seasonal precipitation and the results showed a negative trend in spring and summer and a positive trend in autumn and winter table s1 estimating the trend of pa frequency at different levels the analysis suggested that the pa 250 mm year group increased the most the pa 350 and pa 400 mm year groups decreased the most table s2 this shows that more places became semi arid while the semi wet areas shrank 3 2 spatiotemporal vegetation change in kkrb the spatial mean ndvi during 1999 2015 in kkrb was only 0 10 but ranged from 0 to 0 4 with an uneven spatial distribution more than 40 of the study area had ndvi lower than 0 05 as shown in fig 3 1 fig 3 1 also shows that the mountainous areas in upper kaidu river areas around bosten lake and along upper the konqi river had higher ndvi than elsewhere in the lower reach of the east basin ndvi was almost 0 according to fig 1 areas with relatively high ndvi were mainly grassland and cropland ndvi in most parts of the basin showed no significant trend more than 80 of the study area showed a slightly increasing rate less than 0 005 year 1 fig 3 2 it can be seen that areas with a high increasing rate are located mainly along the upper to middle konqi river and around the north to west rim of bosten lake where the major vegetation type was cropland the overall trend slope of ndvi was only 0 001 significance 0 05 fig 3 3 but if seasonal changes are taken into consideration ndvi showed a significant increasing trend in summer Œ≤ 0 0020 significance 0 01 and autumn Œ≤ 0 0007 significance 0 01 table s3 such seasonal trends show that vegetation condition was improving during the growing season 3 3 correlation between precipitation and ndvi fig 4 shows the relationship between r t and pa the spatial pattern of r t between precipitation and ndvi was similar to the spatial pattern of pa there was a fast growing rate of r t when pa 60 mm year where the mean r t was 0 47 when pa 60 mm year r t showed a very slight declining trend with pa the mean values of r t were 0 36 0 32 0 37 at pa equal to 100 200 and 300 mm year respectively the increasing trend at pa 350 mm year may be due to the trmm data error around the lake which shows as abnormally high values in the lake area fig 2 the spatial pearson coefficient r s of pa and mean ndvi throughout the whole period was 0 46 with significance 0 01 table 1 shows r s of each year during 1999 2015 there is a slightly decreasing trend throughout the period Œ≤ 0 0067 significance 0 99 on a monthly timescale the temporal pattern of r s between precipitation and ndvi showed a unimodal trend throughout the year table 2 from december to march the value of r s was negative and the absolute values were from small to large then back to small the smallest r s value was in january in other months r s values were positive and the variation was in the same pattern with the peak value appearing in july 3 4 impact of spatiotemporal phase differences of precipitation on vegetation change the r s between ndvi and pa in the same year r s between ndvi and pa of the previous year and r s between ndvi and accumulated pa the sum of precipitation in the current year and the previous year are shown in fig 5 1 the results show no obvious difference in trend between these three values of r s suggesting that a time lag effect may not exist on an interannual scale both the seasonality of precipitation and ndvi showed a mono peak pattern annually fig 5 2 monthly precipitation reached a maximum value in july one month prior to the peak monthly mean of ndvi the pearson r of the time series of monthly spatial mean precipitation and monthly mean ndvi r ts was 0 89 using the original time series but was improved to 0 97 by shifting the monthly precipitation to give a one month phase difference the effect of accumulative precipitation was also detected by correlation analysis the r ts values between ndvi and the accumulated precipitation of two month three month and four month were 0 98 0 99 and 0 91 respectively these results suggested that the sum of precipitation in the current month and the previous two months affected ndvi the most to detect the effects of spatiotemporal phase difference in precipitation the kkrb was divided into two regions based on the 200 mm year pa boundary fig s2 areas with pa 200 mm year were mainly located in the northwest upper reach mountainous region while areas with pa 200 mm year were in the middle to lower reaches correlation analysis was undertaken between spatial mean ndvi in areas with pa 200 mm year and different precipitation patterns table 3 it was seen that antecedent accumulative precipitation in the upper reach area correlated most significantly with ndvi in the lower reach arid area 4 discussion 4 1 the properties of spatial relationships between precipitation and vegetation in an arid mountain oasis river basin our results show significant positive correlation between precipitation and ndvi spatially and the correlation varies with the spatial pattern of mean annual precipitation pa this is consistent with similar research in arid areas camberlin et al 2007 georganos et al 2017 zhang et al 2017 previous studies have suggested confidence in the strength of correlation between precipitation and ndvi when pa ranges from 160 to 600 mm year camberlin et al 2007 zhang et al 2017 this seems reasonable as precipitation may not be a control factor for vegetation growth in wet areas in this study the effect of pa began to weaken when pa was less than 60 mm year in such extreme areas the land is little vegetated which may lead to errors in ndvi detected by satellite camberlin et al 2007 this may be a possible reason for the weak correlation between ndvi and precipitation in areas with pa 60 mm year however the correlation analysis of spatial grid data also showed significant results in areas with low ndvi values in our study fig s3 therefore we argue that the weak correlation between precipitation and ndvi in the extreme arid region in our study is because precipitation was too small to support vegetation growth generally the natural water sources for vegetation are precipitation surface runoff and groundwater hao et al 2010 lamontagne et al 2005 yet since the precipitation is insufficient for vegetation growth and the access to surface water is quite limited in arid areas it is widely acknowledged that vegetation growth in such region depends critically on groundwater availability doble et al 2006 naumburg et al 2005 in arid areas the water table is firmly linked to river and lake water tables liu et al 2012 from a holistic point of view at basin scale runoff in lower reaches comes from the upper reach which correlates significantly with precipitation thus precipitation in the upper reach may have great effects on vegetation growth in lower reaches previous works have focused on the spatial patterns of precipitation and ndvi trying to describe the differences in their spatial relationships cui et al 2018 piao et al 2003 xu et al 2012 zhang et al 2017 zhao et al 2011 yet these studies did not clarify whether precipitation in an adjacent region would also influence vegetation cover in the local area especially in an arid mountain oasis river system our results support the hypothesis that precipitation in upper reach area influences on the vegetation growth in lower reach in arid river basins 4 2 the time lag effects of precipitation on vegetation in an arid mountain oasis river basin many studies have verified that precipitation antecedent to the growing season affects vegetation growth zeng et al 2013 analyzed the interannual changes of ndvi based on gimms ndvi3g data set and suggested that precipitation in the current and previous wet season were well correlated to ndvi in herbaceous vegetation papagiannopoulou et al 2017 studied the worldwide multi decadal satellite data and also found a prolonged effect of precipitation on vegetation dynamics in arid regions they point out that plants are sensitive to precipitation that occurred three months earlier zhao et al 2011 suggested that precipitation in the preceding winter would be positively correlated with ndvi variation there are different reasons for a time lag between precipitation and vegetation growth one is that soil moisture memory is long term mo et al 2016 have found that soil water storage during the previous non growing season had the same spatial pattern as vegetation cover change in a semi arid river basin based on annual water balance another reason is the nonlinear and delayed response of vegetation to precipitation change based on in situ observations wolf et al 2013 proved the different strategies of vegetation types dealing with water limited conditions which reflects the different response period of vegetation to water condition change a further possible reason is the residence time of water flowing through different regions helton et al 2014 mcdonnell and beven 2014 since it has been shown that there is a spatial phase difference between precipitation and ndvi dynamics different thresholds of the time lag effect were mentioned due to the specific conditions of climate vegetation and soil type for different studies zhang et al 2017 results in this study show a strong correlation between accumulated precipitation in the previous two months in upper reaches and ndvi in lower reaches in the arid mountain oasis river basin the cumulative effect shows the influence of soil moisture storage in this study effects of precipitation in the previous two months were significant but the effect of precipitation in the antecedent year was not suggesting that soil moisture memory is shorter than seasonal scale in the study area because the soil type in our study area is mostly sand in the lower reaches water flows fast and cannot be held long in the soil unsaturated zone moreover precipitation in upper mountainous areas converts quickly to river runoff flowing downwards and replenishing groundwater which is then pumped by plant roots due to the residence time of water flow in river channel lake and soil it is reasonable for water to take two month to flow from upper areas to lower reaches where it is used by vegetation 4 3 the impact of climate change and human activities and data uncertainties although temperature effects on ndvi were not analyzed directly in this study temperature certainly affects vegetation dynamics according to conclusions from other similar studies fang et al 2005 yao et al 2018 spatial analysis found only weak correlation between ndvi and temperature in this area zhao et al 2011 however the effects of temperature were critical in snow and glacier melting chen et al 2018a b as mentioned before runoff in rivers originating from the mountains in a mountain oasis system depends on meltwater from snow and glaciers hence the relationship between temperature and snow rate glacier line could also be important to ndvi change and this deserves further study as population grows the effect of anthropogenic disturbances becomes significant especially the expansion of agricultural activities nearly 90 of water resources are used to support irrigation in the study area shen et al 2013 thus the change of cropland is directly associated with water resource availability and sustainability it has been shown in this study that the area of cropland grew by 46 4 during the studied period fig 1 2 4 table s4 mostly changing from natural sparse grassland or bare land this contributed to the increasing trend of ndvi in low precipitation regions fig 3 2 although results have shown that this change was still controlled by precipitation because cropland is generally irrigated by groundwater future work should pay more attention to the human induced land cover change for better understanding of the spatiotemporal pattern of vegetation change the spot ndvi and trmm precipitation datasets used in this study have been widely applied in related research for describing trends in regional climate and vegetation dynamics an et al 2015 fensholt et al 2009 wang et al 2012 however these data inevitably contain uncertainties due to systematic and random errors from the satellite equipment and data process algorithms prigent 2010 mo et al 2016 in addition the datasets were pre processed at specific time and space scales e g downscaling spatial resolution and or upscaling temporal resolution before the analyses undertaken in this study which may lead to information loss and additional uncertainties moreover only 17 years of data were analyzed in this study due to the availability of the remote sensing products and this could also be a limitation of this study as shown in fig 2 precipitation trends would change if data were extracted in different time periods therefore more datasets should be explored and compared with in situ observations to make the conclusions robust even though we are confident with the correlation analyses and trends of the final results 5 conclusion based on satellite derived precipitation and ndvi data in a typical mountain oasis in northwest china the spatiotemporal variations of precipitation and vegetation cover and their relationships have been revealed 1 both precipitation and ndvi are unevenly distributed in the basin with relatively high values in the northwest and very low values in the southeast overall precipitation had a general decreasing trend in time but it increased at a faster rate after 2008 ndvi showed no trend in most areas except for a significant change in spring and summer due to expanded cropland 2 most of the area in the basin shows a strong positive correlation between precipitation and ndvi at different temporal and spatial scales and the correlation shows a declining trend during the studied period the spatial pattern of correlation coefficient was determined by the spatial precipitation pattern 3 in this arid mountain oasis river basin the strongest correlation was found between the accumulated precipitation in the previous two months i e the current month and one previous month in the upper reach and ndvi in the lower reach our study has shown a spatiotemporal phase difference in the effect of precipitation on vegetation cover in an arid mountain oasis river basin suggesting that

6426,the importance of representing the spatial structure of rainfall accurately has been emphasized in various hydrological studies it has also been widely acknowledged that there is a need to account for uncertainty in rainfall input common approaches focus on accounting for either point measurement or sampling uncertainty in rainfall estimation we present a method that jointly considers three sources of uncertainty affecting the space time mapping of rainfall point measurement sampling and neighborhood uncertainty to our knowledge neighborhood uncertainty has not been included in any prior rainfall uncertainty analysis we generated an ensemble of 400 realizations of daily rainfall fields at a 2 km 2 km spatial resolution for a catchment in western denmark 1055 km2 at the core of our method is the sequential gaussian simulation sgs technique results indicate that our approach is able to reproduce key statistical features of the rainfall distribution we examined the impact of different spatial grid and catchment and temporal supports one day one month 5 year period on the overall uncertainty we also quantified the effect of each uncertainty source on rainfall field uncertainty finally we compared our simulation results with those of a parallel expert elicitation study we found that the expert elicitation uncertainty for average catchment rainfall in a 5 year period was considerably larger than quantified in our study cv of 1 1 vs 5 an even larger discrepancy was found for the 5 year average of gauge rainfall where expert elicitation resulted in a value that was an order of magnitude higher cv of 0 2 vs 2 possible reasons for this gap are discussed keywords rain gauge rainfall uncertainty sequential gaussian simulation neighborhood uncertainty spatial and temporal support effects 1 introduction the quality of rainfall estimation is crucial in catchment hydrological modeling since low quality in input data propagates through the modeling process and affects the quality of modeling results beven 2012 it is important to ensure that the rainfall input is sufficiently accurate if used in flood forecasting inadequate rainfall input might lead to erroneous predictions with potentially disastrous consequences flawed modeling results might also mislead decision makers resulting in misdirected policies and adverse measures however even the most accurate model inputs will inevitably be uncertain this uncertainty needs to be accounted for especially when model predictions guide water resource management decisions the necessity to perform uncertainty analyses also follows from the precautionary principle which is integrated into the eu water framework directive refsgaard et al 2007 the importance of accounting for uncertainty in rainfall input has been emphasized by several researchers in the field of hydrology e g kavetski et al 2006a and vrugt et al 2008 however kuczera et al 2010 state that ignorance or inadequate treatment of input uncertainty still is a common problem in hydrology rainfall uncertainty is related to both the observation of rainfall by a network of rain gauges and their subsequent spatial estimation using interpolation techniques at present point scale rain gauge observations still constitute the most important rainfall data mcmillan et al 2011 rain gauge observations are affected by point measurement uncertainty which varies among different types of rain gauges and arises from both systematic and random errors mcmillan et al 2012 molini et al 2001 here the term support refers to the area volume or time interval over which a measurement or estimate is made see for example chil√®s and delfiner 2012 characteristics and correction approaches for systematic errors in a variety of gauge types are documented by sevruk 1982 while systematic errors biases if known should be accounted and corrected for random errors are inherently more difficult to deal with research conducted by ciach 2003 and habib et al 2001 for example showed that random errors affecting tipping bucket gauge observations were strongly linked to rainfall intensity and accumulation time sampling uncertainty originates from the inability of a finite set of point observations to capture characteristics of rainfall fields at catchment scale mcmillan et al 2011 firstly the separation distances between rain gauges are generally too large to capture the pronounced spatio temporal variability of rainfall fields villarini et al 2008 for instance wood et al 2000 demonstrated that the spatial variability of rainfall is considerable even at small spatial extents similar results were obtained by krajewski et al 2003 secondly rain gauge measurements represent areas of very limited spatial support see for instance pedersen et al 2010 neighborhood uncertainty is uncertainty relating to unobserved and hence unknown environmental factors that are present in the open space between rain gauges and which influence the amount of rainfall received at that location these factors may for instance be related to physical obstacles such as forest shelterbelts and terrain assuming that i rain gauges were placed strictly following wmo guidelines wmo 2014 and that ii the values measured at rain gauge locations implicitly reflect any remaining environmental factors present in their vicinity neighborhood uncertainty can be considered to be zero at rain gauge locations however it increases with distance from a gauge as observations at gauge locations cannot be assumed to be representative for environmental factors at far away locations i e up to several kilometers away from a gauge assuming neighborhood uncertainty to be systematic constant in time it is also not covered by sampling uncertainty there are several examples in the literature that address rainfall uncertainty point measurement uncertainty was for instance investigated by oudin et al 2006 who looked at the effect of systematic and random errors in point measurements on parameter estimation and model performance of two rainfall runoff models they found that especially random errors had a considerable impact furthermore balin et al 2010 examined how point measurement uncertainty influenced parameter estimates and predictive uncertainty of a distributed hydrological model interestingly the authors only observed a small effect leading them to question the importance of accounting for point measurement uncertainty altogether sampling uncertainty has been studied more extensively while geostatistical methods such as kriging provide a best estimate and a quantification of the estimation error chil√®s and delfiner 2012 kriging has a smoothing effect which leads to an underestimation of spatial variability to address this shortcoming skaugen and andersen 2010 introduced a novel interpolation technique that they claim reproduces spatial variability yet more commonly spatial variability in rainfall fields is reproduced using conditional simulation methods chil√®s and delfiner 2012 these methods account for sampling uncertainty by generating an ensemble of rainfall fields in which each realization is a possible version of reality there are several methods to perform conditional simulation including turning band simulated annealing and sequential gaussian simulation among these sequential gaussian simulation sgs is commonly considered being the most straightforward the reader is referred to e g chil√®s and delfiner 2012 for further details conditional simulation of rainfall fields has been performed at different temporal resolutions including hours renard et al 2011 rakovec et al 2012 days clark and slater 2006 vischel et al 2009 gotzinger and bardossy 2008 and months ekstrom et al 2007 while often neglected in the hydrological literature ekstrom et al 2007 and rakovec et al 2012 make a point of also considering temporal correlations as the above examples illustrate point measurement uncertainty as well as sampling uncertainty have been addressed by other authors however to our knowledge neighborhood uncertainty has not been considered in any rainfall study so far moreover while the above examples focus on one source of rainfall uncertainty we advocate that all three sources of uncertainty introduced previously should be treated simultaneously in order to obtain a more complete estimate of rainfall uncertainty if ignored overall rainfall uncertainty might be grossly underestimated and result in overconfidence in hydrological modelling results which in turn might lead to poor water management decisions this study is part of the research conducted in the context of the danish hydrological observatory project hobe jensen and illangasekare 2011 one of the research objectives of hobe is to achieve water balance closure at catchment scale in this context sebok et al 2016 used expert elicitation to estimate catchment water balances and their individual components as well as associated uncertainties for the same area as in this study with regard to catchment rainfall for a 5 year period the experts reached a consensus at a mean of 1000 mm year and a standard deviation of 50 mm year 5 coefficient of variation however it is likely that the experts were not aware of change of support effects when deriving the aforementioned value for this reason we intended to test whether a geostatistical analysis would be able to confirm the expert s value thus the objectives of the present study are i to develop a statistical model that describes the main sources of uncertainties affecting gauge based observation and space time mapping of rainfall ii to analyze how these uncertainty sources are manifested within a catchment at various spatial and temporal supports and iii to compare the uncertainty resulting from the geostatistical analysis to that found by expert elicitation sebok et al 2016 in contrast to previous studies which address only one source of rainfall uncertainty the approach presented here jointly addresses point measurement uncertainty sampling uncertainty and neighborhood uncertainty while we do not aim to achieve a mathematically rigorous disentanglement of the individual contributions of these sources we strive to obtain a more complete picture of overall rainfall uncertainty the proposed approach includes the generation of an ensemble of 400 daily rainfall fields at a spatial resolution of 2 km 2 km based on sequential gaussian simulation the simulations are performed for a catchment of 1055 km2 located in western denmark the generated rainfall field ensemble will be propagated through a distributed hydrological model in a follow up study 2 study area and data set 2 1 study area the skjern river catchment 2500 km2 is located in western jutland denmark fig 1 the skjern river has its source at the jutland ridge in the east of the ahlergaarde subcatchment 1055 km2 it discharges into the north sea via ringk√∏bing fjord the terrain in the skjern catchment is mostly flat and has a slight east to west elevation gradient the maximum elevation is 139 m and located towards the eastern boundary of the catchment with a mean flow of 37 m3 s the skjern river is the largest in denmark by discharge volume ovesen et al 2000 the surface geology is largely characterized by quaternary deposits the northwest and west of the skjern catchment are covered by relic saalian age moraine material along the river course in the central and western part of the catchment outwash material from the weichsel glaciation dominates occasional dune patches are found in the center and south of the catchment the jutland ridge towards the eastern boundary of the catchment consists of moraine deposits marking the location of late weichselian ice margins houmark nielsen and kjaer 2003 about half of the area 56 is arable land with grain and corn being the most frequently cultivated crops grassland 29 makes up around a third of the land use the remainder of the area is covered by forest heath and urban areas stisen et al 2011 the mean annual precipitation in the catchment is around 1050 mm year with a peak in autumn and winter and a relatively dry period in spring ibid precipitation in the western part of denmark is largely a result of frontal systems which move inland on a west to south westerly trajectory while stratiform rainfall is more frequent in this region convective precipitation may occur during the summer months but plays a more important role in eastern denmark cappelen 2013 2 2 data daily precipitation data are available from a network of 42 rain gauges located within and around the skjern catchment fig 1 the data record covers a 17 year period between 01 01 1990 and 31 12 2006 and is largely gap free 29 gauges with a temporal coverage of 95 9 gauges with 75 temporal coverage 95 and only 4 gauges with 75 temporal coverage the resulting network density is approximately 1 gauge per 110 km2 the rain gauges are part of the danish rain gauge network and most 37 out of 42 are manually operated danish hellmann gauges that provide measurements with a temporal support of one day three of the gauges are automatic devices which additionally measure rainfall intensity at 1 minute intervals while two gauges record rainfall amounts accumulated over 10 minute intervals in a previous study the precipitation data were dynamically catch corrected for mostly wind controlled undercatch stisen et al 2011 using a comprehensive correction method developed by allerup et al 1997 3 methodology we employed a stochastic simulation approach to generate an ensemble of 400 rainfall fields at 2 km 2 km resolution encapsulating the 1055 km2 ahlergaarde catchment note that the grid nodes for which the simulation yielded values were the centers of the grid cells the rainfall fields were simulated for the 5 year period 2002 2006 using daily time steps the approach was designed to account for three sources of uncertainty affecting the space time mapping of rainfall i point measurement uncertainty ii sampling uncertainty and iii neighborhood uncertainty the approach comprised nine steps illustrated in fig 2 3 1 part i preprocessing 3 1 1 step 1 select transformation function the stochastic simulation approach employed sequential gaussian simulation sgs coupled with ordinary kriging ok global search window the application of sgs required that the variable to be simulated followed a gaussian distribution since daily rainfall is not normally distributed a suitable transformation function needed to be chosen generally options are for example the commonly used logarithmic transformation the square root transformation or the normal score transformation 3 1 2 step 2 analyze for spatial trends when using a global search window ordinary kriging works under the assumption of an unknown but constant mean throughout the spatial domain in this case possible non stationarity needs to be identified to detect whether there are linear relationships between observed rainfall and other variables such as elevation correlation analysis can be used if such a linear relationship spatial trend is present in the data the trend should be removed 3 1 3 step 3 estimate variogram another prerequisite for sgs is knowledge of the spatial dependence structure which is given by the variogram Œ≥ h to obtain a mathematical description of this structure an experimental variogram is calculated and a suitable variogram model e g exponential spherical etc is fitted to it 3 2 part ii stochastic simulation 3 2 1 step 4 point measurement uncertainty gauge observations are point measurements and as such may be subject to biases e g due to systematic instrument malfunctioning or systematic undercatch due to wind effects at this stage however we assume such biases to be zero due to perfect instrument functioning and removal of the undercatch error using the correction method developed by allerup et al 1997 while the correction method is assumed to remove systematic errors it potentially introduces its own point measurement uncertainty represented by a perturbation factor Œµ t 1 t 1 t true gauge rainfall r true obtained at a gauge location x i can then be expressed as 1 r t true x i r t x i Œµ t 1 where r t x i is the rainfall measured at the respective gauge and time t that is multiplied by the aforementioned factor Œµ t 1 which in turn can be written as 2 Œµ t 1 n Œº œÉ where Œº is the mean and œÉ is the standard deviation simplifying assumptions are that perturbation factors are gaussian have a mean of Œº 1 0 and a standard deviation œÉ which is equal to a value selected to reflect the uncertainty of the correction method in our study this value was the standard error of the bias correction method see step 4 the as of yet untransformed gauge values are subsequently multiplied with the perturbation factor further assumptions were that i the uncertainty of the correction method on any given day is independent from that of previous days ii it is the same for all gauges in the network on a given day i e Œµ t 1 is a function of time but not space and iii the distribution of perturbation factors is time invariant 3 2 2 step 5 apply transformation to meet the criterion of a gaussian distribution the transformation function identified in step 1 is applied as a result r t true is transformed into r t tf the transformed daily rainfall 3 2 3 step 6 sampling uncertainty to account for sampling uncertainty sequential gaussian simulation coupled with ordinary kriging is employed to generate an ensemble of rainfall fields the ordinary kriging estimate z t tf of transformed daily rainfall at an ungauged location x 0 can be expressed as 3 z t tf x 0 i 1 n Œª i r t tf x i where the Œª i are kriging weights see webster and oliver 2008 the sgs value at any ungauged location z tf sgs x 0 can then be expressed as 4 z t s g s t f x 0 z t tf x 0 Œµ s t 2 x 0 in which Œµ s t 2 represents the sampling uncertainty which is expected to vary both in space and time and can be written as 5 Œµ s t 2 x 0 n 0 œÉ ok 2 x 0 where œÉ ok 2 is the ordinary kriging variance webster and oliver 2008 note that our ok algorithm was given a global search window 3 2 4 step 7 back transform data after completion of the sgs based generation of a rainfall ensemble a back transformation is carried out to obtain physical rainfall values the back transformed rainfall field ensemble is denoted as z sgs 3 2 5 step 8 maintain wet dry ratio rainfall is a process in which observations of no rain also contain valuable information therefore the rainfall field ensemble is forced to contain the same percentage of zeros as the observational data this is achieved by ranking simulated grid values for each day and setting the lowermost fraction corresponding to the percentage of zeros in the observations to zero 3 2 6 step 9 neighborhood uncertainty if a rain gauge is sited according to e g guidelines published by the world meteorological organization wmo 2014 theoretically no physical obstacles should hinder the reception of rainfall any remaining environmental influences will be implicitly reflected in the rainfall measurement however the area represented by a measurement is limited it may range from several hundred square meters to several square kilometers and depends on factors such as physiographic homogeneity ibid once one is outside the representative area of a rain gauge i e up to multiple kilometers away from a gauge environmental factors are likely to change and alter the rainfall amount that reaches the ground given sufficient data statistical relationships between rainfall and these environmental factors may be established and used for spatial prediction of rainfall goovaerts 2000 for instance showed how orographic influence on rainfall can be incorporated into the interpolation of rainfall using kriging with external drift and cokriging yet it is not always possible to extract this kind of information from the data at hand either due to a mix of signals that is difficult to disentangle or due to a lack of survey data in these instances neighborhood uncertainty the uncertainty introduced by spatially varying but unknown environmental conditions arises neighborhood uncertainty is hence covering what otherwise cannot be explained deterministically environmental conditions include but are not limited to elevation land cover and anthropogenic structures due to the assumed permanent nature of these environmental factors and in contrast to sampling uncertainty we presume neighborhood uncertainty to be constant in time based on these considerations we propose to simulate neighborhood uncertainty as a random scaling field we suggest deriving the spatial dependence structure by examining long term average rainfall which we denote climatological rainfall following this rationale the differences remaining after trend correction step 3 in climatological rainfall are then attributable to the effect of environmental conditions that could not be captured deterministically we further assume that the spatial dependence structure variogram of the neighborhood uncertainty is proportional to the variogram of the climatological rainfall i e 6 Œ≥ h neighborhood Œ≥ h climatology thus we calculate the variogram for climatological rainfall and employ it for simulating the random scaling fields using sgs where the kriging estimate of neighborhood uncertainty at ungauged locations z neighborhood x 0 is obtained analogously to z x 0 in eq 3 the sgs generated random scaling field at an ungauged location z neighborhood sgs x 0 is then given by 7 z neighborhood sgs x 0 z neighborhood x 0 Œµ s 3 x 0 in which Œµ s 3 represents the random component of neighborhood uncertainty Œµ s 3 can be written as 8 Œµ s 3 x 0 n 0 œÉ o k neighborhood 2 x 0 with œÉ o k neighborhood 2 x 0 being the ordinary kriging variance related to the scaling field the final outcome the ensemble of rainfall fields z sgs final accounting for three sources of uncertainty is obtained by multiplication 9 z final sgs z sgs z neighborhood sgs 3 3 part iii evaluation after successful simulation the overall uncertainty of the rainfall field ensemble is quantified the uncertainty estimates should be compared with those obtained in other studies 4 set up and test of the stochastic rainfall model 4 1 estimation of model parameters 4 1 1 part i preprocessing to ascertain robust statistical analysis and variogram estimation the preprocessing was carried out at skjern catchment scale 2500 km2 using rainfall observations from 42 rain gauges part ii stochastic simulation was limited to ahlergaarde catchment using information from 14 gauges as conditioning data moreover we selected a subset of days for the preprocessing using the criterion of catchment wide nonzero rainfall this was done to prevent zero observations from influencing the shape of the variogram this selection criterion resulted in 230 days which were used for further analysis implications of only using days with catchment wide rainfall at the preprocessing stage will be discussed later 4 1 1 1 step 1 select transformation function we tested both a logarithmic and a square root transformation to approximate a gaussian distribution in line with findings by schuurmans et al 2007 the square root transformation yielded a better approximation of a gaussian distribution fig 3 and we chose it for further use while fig 3 reveals departures from the 1 1 line in the tail regions of the plot these concern data beyond three standard deviations of the mean according to the 68 95 99 7 rule ca 0 3 as such these are representative of extreme events which are not the focus of this study therefore we consider the deviations as negligible for the purpose of our work 4 1 1 2 step 2 analyze for spatial trends we calculated the coefficient of determination r2 for combinations of climatological rainfall and elevation as well as x distance to coast and y coordinate while no orographic influence was diagnosable analysis revealed a linear relationship between climatological rainfall and the distance to coast with r2 equal to 0 3 we used the corresponding regression relationship to remove the trend from the gauge data and considered it trend free i e stationary afterwards fig 4 4 1 1 3 step 3 estimate variogram while there are built in functions in scientific programming languages such as r and matlab that automatically fit a variogram model to the data we opted for a manually fitted pooled variogram a pooled variogram is obtained by averaging experimental variograms obtained for individual days for each distance lag see for example graler et al 2016 or muthusamy et al 2017 thus resulting in a variogram for average rainy conditions we chose the pooled variogram option over that of using daily variograms because the total number of available rain gauge stations n 42 at skjern catchment is below the 50 data points that are generally recommended to ensure a robust variogram webster oliver 2008 the pooled variogram was subsequently used for every rainy day at the stochastic simulation stage fig 5 shows the pooled variogram we fitted a spherical model to the data in order to derive the pooled variogram we normalized the rainfall data for each day i e calculating standard scores this required scaling using the variance of the respective day of the sill for each day during the stochastic simulation stage 4 1 2 part ii stochastic simulation 4 1 2 1 step 4 point measurement uncertainty as outlined in section 3 we employed perturbation factors to account for point measurement uncertainty to constrain the sampling of these factors we used the 5 reported as standard error for the bias correction method allerup et al 1997 hence the perturbation factors were drawn from a normal distribution with a mean equal to 1 and standard deviation equal to 0 05 i e point measurement uncertainty Œµ t 1 n 1 0 05 4 1 2 2 step 5 apply transformation the rainfall data were transformed using square root transformation see step 3 4 1 2 3 step 6 sampling uncertainty we used the stochastic simulation approach based on sgs and ok outlined in section 3 to generate an ensemble of 400 realizations of rainfall fields for every day in the simulation period years 2002 2006 n 1826 days 4 1 2 4 step 7 back transform after completion of the stochastic simulation we squared all values to obtain physical rainfall values 4 1 2 5 step 8 maintain wet dry ratio as described in the respective paragraph in the methodology section the rainfall field ensemble was forced to preserve the ratio of wet and dry observations to create intermittent rainfall fields 4 1 2 6 step 9 neighborhood uncertainty to account for neighborhood uncertainty we proceeded as follows we computed the average rainfall for each of the 42 rain gauges in skjern catchment using the available trend corrected step 3 17 year rainfall record 1990 2006 we considered the result to represent the climatological rainfall then we estimated the variogram for climatological rainfall the resulting experimental variogram spherical variogram model is given in fig 6 we assumed that the spatial dependence structure of climatological rainfall after trend correction is a result of the unknown environmental conditions that give rise to neighborhood uncertainty and that the variogram can be used to generate the random scaling fields representing neighborhood uncertainty to derive these random scaling fields we did the following first we assumed the neighborhood uncertainty at gauge locations and the area surrounding the gauges to be zero as environmental factors were assumed to be implicitly reflected by the measurements see section 3 step 9 this meant that each 2x2 km grid cell of the random scaling fields that contained a rain gauge was assigned a value of 1 no neighborhood uncertainty second we used sgs to generate an ensemble of 400 random scaling fields matching the number of realizations in the rainfall ensemble third to reproduce the spatial variability found for the climatological rainfall the variogram obtained for climatological rainfall was adjusted simply by rescaling the sill value field variance see table 1 finally to impose the effect of neighborhood uncertainty Œµ s 3 on the sgs simulated rainfall fields the random scaling fields were used to scale the back transformed sgs generated rainfall fields i e the ith realization of a rainfall field for every day in the simulation period was multiplied with the ith random scaling field 4 2 validation 4 2 1 reproduction of statistical distribution fig 7 shows qq plots for 5 out of 400 realizations generated at two selected dates a randomly chosen day from a summer period 3 august 2002 and a randomly chosen day from a winter period 11 january 2006 these dates belong to the 230 day subset with catchment wide rainfall introduced in section 4 1 and are used throughout this section for reasons of consistency the five realizations shown were selected in the following manner first the experimental variogram values for each realization were added second the realizations were ranked by the resulting sum third the realizations whose sum marked the 10th 25th 50th 75th and 90th percentile were chosen to be displayed in the figure for both selected days the quantile markers plot close to the bisector indicating that both the observed as well as the simulated values approximately follow the same distribution while the quantile markers are mostly located slightly above the 1 1 line for 3 august 2002 apart from the last quantile the markers for 11 january 2006 are mostly slightly below the 1 1 line these deviations can be explained by a combination of the effects of i the back transformation from square root transformed data into real space ii imbalance with regard to the number of values each quantile marker represents iii usage of a pooled variogram model instead of one derived for the respective day the linear structures in the qq plots result from five different quantile locations for each of the five realizations while the quantiles for the observations obviously remain the same the width of the linear structures indicates the spread of the ensemble given the fact that the two outer dots represent the 10th and 90th percentile respectively 4 2 2 reproduction of spatial distribution fig 8 shows experimental variograms for five realizations generated at the same two dates as before several observations can be made from fig 8 firstly all experimental variograms have a nugget well below that of the employed pooled variogram model pvm skj secondly already at short lag distances 10 km the experimental variograms overestimate the pooled variogram model these observation are also representative of the experimental variograms obtained for most other days of the 230 day subset a possible explanation for this mismatch is that the pooled variogram model used in the sgs pvm skj is derived based on data from 42 gauges at the skjern catchment scale section 4 1 while the simulations are carried out for the ahlergaarde subcatchment 14 gauges this indicates that the assumption of stationarity in space at least when examining individual days does not hold however from fig 8 it appears that the impact of the gauge data as conditioning data to a large extent outweighs the influence of the supplied pooled variogram model pvm skj for comparison the pooled variogram model for the ahlergaarde subcatchment pvm ahl is plotted as a dotted line what can be observed is that the experimental variograms of the five realizations approximate the pooled variogram model for the ahlergaarde subcatchment particularly with regard to the shape of the variogram and its range 5 simulation results 5 1 impact of temporal and spatial support on convergence fig 9 shows how the median black line of simulated rainfall converges to a stable value with increasing number of realizations used to calculate it to illustrate the impact of spatial support results are presented for two individual locations an arbitrarily selected rain gauge gauge location left hand column and an arbitrarily selected grid cell without a rain gauge ungauged location centre column and the catchment average obtained based on 317 grid cells right hand column the impact of temporal support is demonstrated by using different temporal supports one day one month 5 year period in case of the 5 year period uppermost row and two individual months a summer month and a winter month second and third row the rainfall is the average rainfall across a 5 year period and one month respectively the two days are the same that were used in section 4 2 validation in fig 9 the distance between the dashed grey lines can be used as a measure of uncertainty about the rainfall at the gauge location this difference is smallest fluctuations are solely caused by the point measurement uncertainty Œµ t 1 because the stochastic simulation preserves observations at gauge locations in contrast at the ungauged location the difference between the 25th and 75th percentile is significantly larger the larger variability in the simulated rainfall values as compared to that of the gauged location is a result of both the sampling uncertainty Œµ s t 2 and the neighborhood uncertainty Œµ s 3 finally the corresponding difference for the catchment average is somewhere in between that of gauged and ungauged location naturally this is a result of the spatial averaging across 317 grid values to obtain catchment average rainfall leading to a reduction in uncertainty the impact of temporal support on rainfall uncertainty is demonstrated in the centre column ungauged location in fig 9 note that the y axis is fixed for all panels within a row but varies from row to row for the 5 year average the resulting difference between 25th and 75th percentile is 0 1 mm signifying very little variation at month support june and december 2002 this difference is larger 1 mm and 0 2 mm respectively finally for daily support the difference between the 25th and the 75th percentiles is ca 10 mm and 3 mm respectively thus the larger the temporal support the smaller the resulting variability another observation is that the median oscillates significantly when calculated for only a few realizations but stabilizes soon thereafter at around 100 realizations for the 5 year period the oscillation continues until almost 300 realizations a side effect of the scaling of the y axis yet with a relatively small magnitude beyond ca 50 realizations however the fact that the median in most cases displays a stabilization already at around 100 realizations can be interpreted as an indicator that an ensemble size of 100 is sufficient to adequately represent uncertainty therefore we conclude that the ensemble of 400 used in the present study sufficiently represents the spatial heterogeneity of rainfall in the study area table 2 illustrates that the uncertainty expressed by the coefficient of variation cv is lowest for the 5 year period i e for largest temporal support and highest for individual days i e smallest temporal support for the gauged location the magnitude of the cv is exclusively controlled by the point scale uncertainty Œµ t 1 with regard to the two individual dates 3 aug 2002 and 11 jan 2006 the cv of around 5 agrees very well with the standard deviation used to characterise Œµ t 1 section 4 1 step 4 at the ungauged location the cv is considerably higher ranging from 5 to 72 this is a result of i the sampling uncertainty Œµ s t 2 and ii the neighborhood uncertainty Œµ s 3 the impact of Œµ s 3 becomes visible as the temporal support increases for the 5 year period adding the neighborhood uncertainty Œµ s 3 causes a threefold increase in the cv the same can be observed for the cv on the catchment average basically all three uncertainties contribute at point scale grid cell day averaging in time removes the effect of Œµ t 1 and Œµ s t 2 while averaging over space removes the effect of Œµ s t 2 and Œµ s 3 averaging over space and time removes the effect of all three and the removal is gradual 5 2 impact of temporal support on ensemble averages fig 10 presents rainfall ensemble averages left panel and ensemble standard deviations right panel with different temporal support one day one month and a 5 year period for the ahlergaarde subcatchment based on 400 realizations the ensemble averages with the largest temporal support 5 year period are seen to exhibit the smallest spread and range from ca 2 6 to 3 1 mm day depending on grid location the smaller the temporal support the larger is the spread in the ensemble average values approximately 7 and 40 mm day for one day support and 0 5 and 2 mm day for 1 month support common for all temporal supports is that spatial patterns are visible for example when looking at the 5 year period the smallest ensemble average values coincide with four individual gauge locations in the southwest to west and north to northeast of the catchment highest values are found further away from gauges where gauge density is low the overall image is relatively smooth with regard to the standard deviation of the ensemble averages a logical observation is that the lowest standard deviations are found at gauge locations here the variation is entirely controlled by the point measurement uncertainty Œµ t 1 in contrast the ensemble standard deviation increases with distance to a gauge location similar to what was observed before the larger the temporal support the smaller is the standard deviation on the ensemble average values note that ensemble averages do not reflect the spatial variability and correlation structure of rainfall fields table 3 shows the increase in cv when gradually including more sources of uncertainty into the simulation for different temporal support and two gauge network configurations complete network 14 gauges and reduced network 3 gauges the reduced network configuration was chosen to illustrate the consequences of recent shut downs of rain gauges in the study area for the simulated rainfall uncertainty the base case exhibits the highest cv 12 73 at the day scale and the lowest at the annual scale 0 67 aggregating temporally clearly leads to reduction in variation and hence smaller cvs with regard to the complete network including point measurement uncertainty Œµ t 1 leads to a notable increase in cv which is roughly the same for all temporal supports 25 5 26 9 when further adding neighborhood uncertainty Œµ s 3 differences become apparent while there is only a marginal increase to 26 6 at the day level the cv for monthly values from 26 5 to 36 5 increases notably whereas the cv for annual values increases significantly from 26 9 to 104 5 when looking at the reduced network a first observation is that as could be expected including fewer gauges into the simulation leads to a significant increase in cv at all temporal supports 76 1 79 1 when adding point measurement uncertainty Œµ t 1 there is once again an increase in cv this increase however is not as pronounced as for the complete network day level from 78 2 to 93 2 or an 8 4 increase if based on the cv of 22 69 this is due to the fact that a reduction in the number of gauges automatically implies that the impact of perturbing the observations with scaling factors carries less weight with regard to the simulated uncertainty finally when including neighborhood uncertainty Œµ s 3 a similar observation as for the complete network can be made while there is only a slight change in cv at day level the cv is increased threefold as compared to the base case by 295 5 5 3 evaluation of simulation results as a final part of the procedure depicted in the flow chart in fig 1 we evaluated the simulation results by comparing the uncertainty estimates from the simulation ensemble with those found in the expert elicitation study conducted by sebok et al 2016 when quantifying uncertainty based on the values simulated at gauge locations in the 5 year period 2002 2006 we obtain a cv of 0 24 in contrast the experts appraisal of uncertainty for point scale rainfall observations results in a cv of 2 with regard to the catchment scale the uncertainty cv calculated from the simulation ensemble in the 5 year period 2002 2006 is equal to 1 13 while the expert elicitation study reports a cv of 5 evidently there is a considerable mismatch between the uncertainty estimates obtained by means of expert elicitation and the stochastic simulation approach presented in this study this difference may be due to the large number of uncertainty sources ten for point scale rainfall considered in the expert elicitation study while we chose to incorporate point measurement uncertainty using only the uncertainty due to bias correction examples for other sources identified by the experts are observation record inhomogeneity instrument defect no detection of light drizzle snow capping and freezing conditions ibid hence a possibility to reduce the difference between the two uncertainty estimates would be to include one or more point scale uncertainties found by the experts some of these uncertainty sources imply uncertainties that are constant in time and space such as systematic instrument errors in a numerical experiment we therefore considered a fourth source of uncertainty Œµ 4 a systematic point measurement uncertainty assumed to be constant in space and time plausible for instance if rain gauges from a certain manufacturer were found to be systematically biased thus effectively being a multiplication factor for every ensemble time series if assumed gaussian the multiplication factors are then sampled from a normal distribution with a mean of 1 and a standard deviation of 2 and 5 which were considered to represent plausible values for systematic instrument errors respectively after applying these factors to the simulated ensemble the cv at catchment scale is found to be inflated to 2 30 and 5 1 respectively thus being considerably closer to the expert elicitation value while having no means to verify that a systematic uncertainty at point scale of 2 5 is correct and expert elicitation results obviously also are uncertain we argue that the uncertainty simulated using only the three considered sources of uncertainty appears unrealistically small furthermore we argue that the existence of some systematic uncertainty of the rain gauge observations appears realistic while the experts were selected based on a good knowledge of the measurement of precipitation their experience regarding geostatistical theories varied considerably accordingly they were not asked to quantify the space time correlation structure 6 discussion this paper presents an approach that allows considering three sources of rainfall uncertainty simultaneously we combine well established techniques to account for point measurement Œµ t 1 and sampling uncertainty Œµ s t 2 see for example kavetski et al 2006b balin et al 2010 or rakovec et al 2012 but propose a novel procedure that allows to incorporate neighborhood uncertainty Œµ s 3 into the uncertainty estimation in doing so it is our intent to introduce new elements into the discussion revolving around rainfall uncertainty quantification we hold on to our claim that the sources considered in our study are clearly differentiable from a conceptual point of view but we acknowledge that our study set up does not allow us to disentangle them in a mathematically rigorous manner thus we currently cannot verify whether the terms used to describe the uncertainties indeed capture what they are designed to capture while a bayesian framework may provide the theoretical basis for this previous applications while highly sophisticated in themselves have not considered more than one source of rainfall uncertainty kavetski et al 2003 ajami et al 2007 renard et al 2011 whether or not it would be feasible to devise a bayesian framework able to accommodate different sources of rainfall uncertainty will have to be researched further similarly the question of whether the overall rainfall uncertainty obtained using our approach is affected by cross compensation between different sources will have to be thoroughly examined by means of targeted experimentation in a follow up study in spite of this we hold that what we denote neighborhood uncertainty i e the uncertainty due to the temporally permanent effect of unknown environmental conditions on rainfall at ungauged locations has been disregarded so far in studies dealing with rainfall uncertainty analysis we would like to emphasize that neighborhood uncertainty is a theoretical construct that covers what otherwise cannot be explained deterministically this is in contrast to e g the well known effect of orography on rainfall goovaerts 2000 for instance demonstrated how given a statistically significant relationship elevation can be used in the spatial prediction of rainfall clark and slater 2006 illustrated how elevation and a several other physical attributes can be incorporated into a probabilistic approach to generate rainfall fields we found a similar notion to that of neighborhood uncertainty in an example from urban hydrology mcgrane 2016 and references therein where the author mentions that urban areas have an impact on rainfall through the heat island effect as well as aerosols yet this has apparently not led to a consideration in form of an uncertainty source similarly engeland et al 2016 mention unknown spatial trends that affect precipitation however they do not follow up on the issue in their study to the best of our knowledge no framework for the treatment of this source of uncertainty in a rainfall uncertainty context has been proposed so far potentially the sum metric model used in space time geostatistics could be employed to account for neighborhood point measurement and sampling uncertainty in a mathematically coherent manner the model distinguishes between purely spatial purely temporal and spatio temporal components graler et al 2016 what we label neighborhood uncertainty in this study essentially corresponds to the purely spatial since temporally persistent component of the sum metric model other examples for the application of the sum metric model are e g jost et al 2005 and kilibarda et al 2014 regardless of the approach one choses we are convinced that there are compelling reasons to account for neighborhood uncertainty one way or another after all when aiming for a more complete assessment of uncertainty and to avoid its underestimation it is necessary to find ways of describing and incorporating uncertainty sources even if they are hard to describe statistically mcmillan et al 2012 given our theoretical considerations specified in section 3 our results indicate that neighborhood uncertainty due to its assumed property of being constant in time strongly contributes to overall rainfall uncertainty at temporal and spatial scales relevant for water resource management therefore we suggest to further investigate neighborhood uncertainty especially in the context of catchment scale water management planning the second novelty of this paper is that the simulated rainfall uncertainty at both point and catchment scale is compared to the uncertainty estimates found in the course of an expert elicitation study sebok et al 2016 as was shown in section 5 3 the experts uncertainty estimates were several times higher than the ones obtained from the simulation we concluded that the simulation underestimated uncertainty due to omission of uncertainty sources the experts had considered arguably the two approaches are difficult to compare due to the obvious differences in methodology however we point out that one of the merits of expert elicitation is exactly the flexibility of being able to process information gathered by means of various different techniques at the same time and conflating it into uncertainty estimates while one has to be aware that these estimates inevitably are subjective and prone to personal bias there are methodological measures in place that ascertain the robustness of the method therefore we are convinced that expert elicitation is a promising tool that is able to supplement classical uncertainty estimation while we demonstrated that our stochastic simulation approach is flexible in that it is possible to account at least for the combined effect of the three sources of rainfall uncertainty and successfully reproduces key statistical features of the rainfall data we are aware of its limitations for example we consider the rainfall data to be trend free after correcting for a linear relationship between rainfall and distance to coast as the simulation based variograms on selected days indicate the assumption of stationarity after trend correction may not hold on the daily scale instead of treating the existing spatial trend prior to the stochastic simulation we could have attempted to incorporate the trend estimation into the simulation procedure see for example kyriakidis et al 2004 the authors carry out spatio temporal simulation of rainfall fields by differentiating between a deterministic trend and a stochastic residual component in a study presented by clark and slater 2006 the authors present a method that generates daily precipitation fields by including information related to the topography time invariant spatial attributes in the shape of a weighted regression relation into the estimation process furthermore we neglect temporal correlation in our stochastic simulation yet rakovec et al 2012 emphasize the relevance of accounting for temporal correlation and present a rainfall simulator for hourly time steps that conditions simulated rainfall fields on a certain number of previously simulated fields however following findings obtained by he et al 2011 we considered temporal correlation in the simulation of daily rainfall fields to be negligible we acknowledge that our model is therefore limited to the simulation of daily rainfall data and that it would not be valid for finer resolutions such as hourly values where temporal correlation would be important finally we employed a pooled variogram during the stochastic simulation stage while we did that to derive a variogram that was more robust than individual ones for each day and potentially based on very few data we are aware that this procedure possibly led to an overrepresentation of catchment wide frontal rainfall and that a variogram for convective rainfall might exhibit a shorter range however considering that frontal rainfall predominates in the study area we argue that this is a minor issue here 7 conclusion in the majority of studies addressing rainfall uncertainty the uncertainty is ascribed to a single source either point measurement or sampling uncertainty in proposing an approach that jointly considers three sources of uncertainty we leave well trodden paths in rainfall uncertainty estimation while we introduce new elements into rainfall uncertainty analysis to obtain a more comprehensive picture of overall rainfall uncertainty not that we do not provide a mathematically rigorous framework to disentangle the individual contributions still our analysis showed that the overall uncertainty on the average rainfall in a 5 year period was considerably larger than if only sampling uncertainty had been accounted for near threefold increase in the 5 year average of catchment rainfall from this we concluded that overall rainfall uncertainty is grossly underestimated if the additional sources had been neglected however when comparing our results to those of an expert elicitation for the same catchment sebok et al 2016 we found a considerable mismatch between the uncertainty estimates expert elicitation results in four times larger uncertainty for catchment average rainfall indicating that our approach may still be significantly underestimating actual uncertainty this gap could be reduced by including further sources of uncertainty identified by the experts into the simulation procedure and might be the focus of future work as the stochastic simulation approach presented in this study is flexible future application can be augmented by including more of these uncertainties having noted the significant difference between the expert elicitation study and our analysis it should be recognized that also the results of expert elicitation must be considered uncertain themselves we illustrated and more importantly quantified the effect of the individual sources of uncertainty on total rainfall uncertainty for different spatial and temporal support scales however we are aware that our findings are valid only within the domain of our assumptions to verify the validity of these assumptions additional data and further experimentation will be necessary bearing this in mind analysis of our results led to the following general observations overall rainfall uncertainty decreases as the temporal support increases this is attributable to temporal averaging and a corresponding loss of variation with regard to the uncertainty at point scale one has to distinguish between gauged and ungauged locations the uncertainty at gauged locations is rather small and a direct result of the incorporation of point measurement uncertainty in contrast the uncertainty at ungauged locations is a combination of both the sampling uncertainty accounted for by stochastic sampling during sgs and the additional variation injected by the point measurement uncertainty another general observation is that all three uncertainties contribute at the smallest temporal and spatial support grid day averaging in time removes the effect of point measurement and sampling uncertainty resulting in neighborhood uncertainty becoming increasingly dominant a similar effect is observed when the gauge network density is reduced averaging over space removes the effect of sampling and neigborhood uncertainty averaging over space and time removes the effect of all three sources of uncertainty the removal is gradual while our findings regarding the impact of changes to spatial temporal support and network density only confirm what had to be expected based on logical considerations increasing the support reduces uncertainty due to the averaging effect of large numbers we consider the observation that neighborhood uncertainty is prevailing for large temporal support to be a conclusion of importance and practical implications after all water resource management and planning commonly operates on annual time scales and at catchment size spatial scales therefore we think that the concept of neighborhood uncertainty i e the long term effect of unknown environmental conditions on rainfall amounts at ungauged locations should be integrated into rainfall uncertainty estimation especially when working on spatial and time scales frequently encountered in water resource management

6426,the importance of representing the spatial structure of rainfall accurately has been emphasized in various hydrological studies it has also been widely acknowledged that there is a need to account for uncertainty in rainfall input common approaches focus on accounting for either point measurement or sampling uncertainty in rainfall estimation we present a method that jointly considers three sources of uncertainty affecting the space time mapping of rainfall point measurement sampling and neighborhood uncertainty to our knowledge neighborhood uncertainty has not been included in any prior rainfall uncertainty analysis we generated an ensemble of 400 realizations of daily rainfall fields at a 2 km 2 km spatial resolution for a catchment in western denmark 1055 km2 at the core of our method is the sequential gaussian simulation sgs technique results indicate that our approach is able to reproduce key statistical features of the rainfall distribution we examined the impact of different spatial grid and catchment and temporal supports one day one month 5 year period on the overall uncertainty we also quantified the effect of each uncertainty source on rainfall field uncertainty finally we compared our simulation results with those of a parallel expert elicitation study we found that the expert elicitation uncertainty for average catchment rainfall in a 5 year period was considerably larger than quantified in our study cv of 1 1 vs 5 an even larger discrepancy was found for the 5 year average of gauge rainfall where expert elicitation resulted in a value that was an order of magnitude higher cv of 0 2 vs 2 possible reasons for this gap are discussed keywords rain gauge rainfall uncertainty sequential gaussian simulation neighborhood uncertainty spatial and temporal support effects 1 introduction the quality of rainfall estimation is crucial in catchment hydrological modeling since low quality in input data propagates through the modeling process and affects the quality of modeling results beven 2012 it is important to ensure that the rainfall input is sufficiently accurate if used in flood forecasting inadequate rainfall input might lead to erroneous predictions with potentially disastrous consequences flawed modeling results might also mislead decision makers resulting in misdirected policies and adverse measures however even the most accurate model inputs will inevitably be uncertain this uncertainty needs to be accounted for especially when model predictions guide water resource management decisions the necessity to perform uncertainty analyses also follows from the precautionary principle which is integrated into the eu water framework directive refsgaard et al 2007 the importance of accounting for uncertainty in rainfall input has been emphasized by several researchers in the field of hydrology e g kavetski et al 2006a and vrugt et al 2008 however kuczera et al 2010 state that ignorance or inadequate treatment of input uncertainty still is a common problem in hydrology rainfall uncertainty is related to both the observation of rainfall by a network of rain gauges and their subsequent spatial estimation using interpolation techniques at present point scale rain gauge observations still constitute the most important rainfall data mcmillan et al 2011 rain gauge observations are affected by point measurement uncertainty which varies among different types of rain gauges and arises from both systematic and random errors mcmillan et al 2012 molini et al 2001 here the term support refers to the area volume or time interval over which a measurement or estimate is made see for example chil√®s and delfiner 2012 characteristics and correction approaches for systematic errors in a variety of gauge types are documented by sevruk 1982 while systematic errors biases if known should be accounted and corrected for random errors are inherently more difficult to deal with research conducted by ciach 2003 and habib et al 2001 for example showed that random errors affecting tipping bucket gauge observations were strongly linked to rainfall intensity and accumulation time sampling uncertainty originates from the inability of a finite set of point observations to capture characteristics of rainfall fields at catchment scale mcmillan et al 2011 firstly the separation distances between rain gauges are generally too large to capture the pronounced spatio temporal variability of rainfall fields villarini et al 2008 for instance wood et al 2000 demonstrated that the spatial variability of rainfall is considerable even at small spatial extents similar results were obtained by krajewski et al 2003 secondly rain gauge measurements represent areas of very limited spatial support see for instance pedersen et al 2010 neighborhood uncertainty is uncertainty relating to unobserved and hence unknown environmental factors that are present in the open space between rain gauges and which influence the amount of rainfall received at that location these factors may for instance be related to physical obstacles such as forest shelterbelts and terrain assuming that i rain gauges were placed strictly following wmo guidelines wmo 2014 and that ii the values measured at rain gauge locations implicitly reflect any remaining environmental factors present in their vicinity neighborhood uncertainty can be considered to be zero at rain gauge locations however it increases with distance from a gauge as observations at gauge locations cannot be assumed to be representative for environmental factors at far away locations i e up to several kilometers away from a gauge assuming neighborhood uncertainty to be systematic constant in time it is also not covered by sampling uncertainty there are several examples in the literature that address rainfall uncertainty point measurement uncertainty was for instance investigated by oudin et al 2006 who looked at the effect of systematic and random errors in point measurements on parameter estimation and model performance of two rainfall runoff models they found that especially random errors had a considerable impact furthermore balin et al 2010 examined how point measurement uncertainty influenced parameter estimates and predictive uncertainty of a distributed hydrological model interestingly the authors only observed a small effect leading them to question the importance of accounting for point measurement uncertainty altogether sampling uncertainty has been studied more extensively while geostatistical methods such as kriging provide a best estimate and a quantification of the estimation error chil√®s and delfiner 2012 kriging has a smoothing effect which leads to an underestimation of spatial variability to address this shortcoming skaugen and andersen 2010 introduced a novel interpolation technique that they claim reproduces spatial variability yet more commonly spatial variability in rainfall fields is reproduced using conditional simulation methods chil√®s and delfiner 2012 these methods account for sampling uncertainty by generating an ensemble of rainfall fields in which each realization is a possible version of reality there are several methods to perform conditional simulation including turning band simulated annealing and sequential gaussian simulation among these sequential gaussian simulation sgs is commonly considered being the most straightforward the reader is referred to e g chil√®s and delfiner 2012 for further details conditional simulation of rainfall fields has been performed at different temporal resolutions including hours renard et al 2011 rakovec et al 2012 days clark and slater 2006 vischel et al 2009 gotzinger and bardossy 2008 and months ekstrom et al 2007 while often neglected in the hydrological literature ekstrom et al 2007 and rakovec et al 2012 make a point of also considering temporal correlations as the above examples illustrate point measurement uncertainty as well as sampling uncertainty have been addressed by other authors however to our knowledge neighborhood uncertainty has not been considered in any rainfall study so far moreover while the above examples focus on one source of rainfall uncertainty we advocate that all three sources of uncertainty introduced previously should be treated simultaneously in order to obtain a more complete estimate of rainfall uncertainty if ignored overall rainfall uncertainty might be grossly underestimated and result in overconfidence in hydrological modelling results which in turn might lead to poor water management decisions this study is part of the research conducted in the context of the danish hydrological observatory project hobe jensen and illangasekare 2011 one of the research objectives of hobe is to achieve water balance closure at catchment scale in this context sebok et al 2016 used expert elicitation to estimate catchment water balances and their individual components as well as associated uncertainties for the same area as in this study with regard to catchment rainfall for a 5 year period the experts reached a consensus at a mean of 1000 mm year and a standard deviation of 50 mm year 5 coefficient of variation however it is likely that the experts were not aware of change of support effects when deriving the aforementioned value for this reason we intended to test whether a geostatistical analysis would be able to confirm the expert s value thus the objectives of the present study are i to develop a statistical model that describes the main sources of uncertainties affecting gauge based observation and space time mapping of rainfall ii to analyze how these uncertainty sources are manifested within a catchment at various spatial and temporal supports and iii to compare the uncertainty resulting from the geostatistical analysis to that found by expert elicitation sebok et al 2016 in contrast to previous studies which address only one source of rainfall uncertainty the approach presented here jointly addresses point measurement uncertainty sampling uncertainty and neighborhood uncertainty while we do not aim to achieve a mathematically rigorous disentanglement of the individual contributions of these sources we strive to obtain a more complete picture of overall rainfall uncertainty the proposed approach includes the generation of an ensemble of 400 daily rainfall fields at a spatial resolution of 2 km 2 km based on sequential gaussian simulation the simulations are performed for a catchment of 1055 km2 located in western denmark the generated rainfall field ensemble will be propagated through a distributed hydrological model in a follow up study 2 study area and data set 2 1 study area the skjern river catchment 2500 km2 is located in western jutland denmark fig 1 the skjern river has its source at the jutland ridge in the east of the ahlergaarde subcatchment 1055 km2 it discharges into the north sea via ringk√∏bing fjord the terrain in the skjern catchment is mostly flat and has a slight east to west elevation gradient the maximum elevation is 139 m and located towards the eastern boundary of the catchment with a mean flow of 37 m3 s the skjern river is the largest in denmark by discharge volume ovesen et al 2000 the surface geology is largely characterized by quaternary deposits the northwest and west of the skjern catchment are covered by relic saalian age moraine material along the river course in the central and western part of the catchment outwash material from the weichsel glaciation dominates occasional dune patches are found in the center and south of the catchment the jutland ridge towards the eastern boundary of the catchment consists of moraine deposits marking the location of late weichselian ice margins houmark nielsen and kjaer 2003 about half of the area 56 is arable land with grain and corn being the most frequently cultivated crops grassland 29 makes up around a third of the land use the remainder of the area is covered by forest heath and urban areas stisen et al 2011 the mean annual precipitation in the catchment is around 1050 mm year with a peak in autumn and winter and a relatively dry period in spring ibid precipitation in the western part of denmark is largely a result of frontal systems which move inland on a west to south westerly trajectory while stratiform rainfall is more frequent in this region convective precipitation may occur during the summer months but plays a more important role in eastern denmark cappelen 2013 2 2 data daily precipitation data are available from a network of 42 rain gauges located within and around the skjern catchment fig 1 the data record covers a 17 year period between 01 01 1990 and 31 12 2006 and is largely gap free 29 gauges with a temporal coverage of 95 9 gauges with 75 temporal coverage 95 and only 4 gauges with 75 temporal coverage the resulting network density is approximately 1 gauge per 110 km2 the rain gauges are part of the danish rain gauge network and most 37 out of 42 are manually operated danish hellmann gauges that provide measurements with a temporal support of one day three of the gauges are automatic devices which additionally measure rainfall intensity at 1 minute intervals while two gauges record rainfall amounts accumulated over 10 minute intervals in a previous study the precipitation data were dynamically catch corrected for mostly wind controlled undercatch stisen et al 2011 using a comprehensive correction method developed by allerup et al 1997 3 methodology we employed a stochastic simulation approach to generate an ensemble of 400 rainfall fields at 2 km 2 km resolution encapsulating the 1055 km2 ahlergaarde catchment note that the grid nodes for which the simulation yielded values were the centers of the grid cells the rainfall fields were simulated for the 5 year period 2002 2006 using daily time steps the approach was designed to account for three sources of uncertainty affecting the space time mapping of rainfall i point measurement uncertainty ii sampling uncertainty and iii neighborhood uncertainty the approach comprised nine steps illustrated in fig 2 3 1 part i preprocessing 3 1 1 step 1 select transformation function the stochastic simulation approach employed sequential gaussian simulation sgs coupled with ordinary kriging ok global search window the application of sgs required that the variable to be simulated followed a gaussian distribution since daily rainfall is not normally distributed a suitable transformation function needed to be chosen generally options are for example the commonly used logarithmic transformation the square root transformation or the normal score transformation 3 1 2 step 2 analyze for spatial trends when using a global search window ordinary kriging works under the assumption of an unknown but constant mean throughout the spatial domain in this case possible non stationarity needs to be identified to detect whether there are linear relationships between observed rainfall and other variables such as elevation correlation analysis can be used if such a linear relationship spatial trend is present in the data the trend should be removed 3 1 3 step 3 estimate variogram another prerequisite for sgs is knowledge of the spatial dependence structure which is given by the variogram Œ≥ h to obtain a mathematical description of this structure an experimental variogram is calculated and a suitable variogram model e g exponential spherical etc is fitted to it 3 2 part ii stochastic simulation 3 2 1 step 4 point measurement uncertainty gauge observations are point measurements and as such may be subject to biases e g due to systematic instrument malfunctioning or systematic undercatch due to wind effects at this stage however we assume such biases to be zero due to perfect instrument functioning and removal of the undercatch error using the correction method developed by allerup et al 1997 while the correction method is assumed to remove systematic errors it potentially introduces its own point measurement uncertainty represented by a perturbation factor Œµ t 1 t 1 t true gauge rainfall r true obtained at a gauge location x i can then be expressed as 1 r t true x i r t x i Œµ t 1 where r t x i is the rainfall measured at the respective gauge and time t that is multiplied by the aforementioned factor Œµ t 1 which in turn can be written as 2 Œµ t 1 n Œº œÉ where Œº is the mean and œÉ is the standard deviation simplifying assumptions are that perturbation factors are gaussian have a mean of Œº 1 0 and a standard deviation œÉ which is equal to a value selected to reflect the uncertainty of the correction method in our study this value was the standard error of the bias correction method see step 4 the as of yet untransformed gauge values are subsequently multiplied with the perturbation factor further assumptions were that i the uncertainty of the correction method on any given day is independent from that of previous days ii it is the same for all gauges in the network on a given day i e Œµ t 1 is a function of time but not space and iii the distribution of perturbation factors is time invariant 3 2 2 step 5 apply transformation to meet the criterion of a gaussian distribution the transformation function identified in step 1 is applied as a result r t true is transformed into r t tf the transformed daily rainfall 3 2 3 step 6 sampling uncertainty to account for sampling uncertainty sequential gaussian simulation coupled with ordinary kriging is employed to generate an ensemble of rainfall fields the ordinary kriging estimate z t tf of transformed daily rainfall at an ungauged location x 0 can be expressed as 3 z t tf x 0 i 1 n Œª i r t tf x i where the Œª i are kriging weights see webster and oliver 2008 the sgs value at any ungauged location z tf sgs x 0 can then be expressed as 4 z t s g s t f x 0 z t tf x 0 Œµ s t 2 x 0 in which Œµ s t 2 represents the sampling uncertainty which is expected to vary both in space and time and can be written as 5 Œµ s t 2 x 0 n 0 œÉ ok 2 x 0 where œÉ ok 2 is the ordinary kriging variance webster and oliver 2008 note that our ok algorithm was given a global search window 3 2 4 step 7 back transform data after completion of the sgs based generation of a rainfall ensemble a back transformation is carried out to obtain physical rainfall values the back transformed rainfall field ensemble is denoted as z sgs 3 2 5 step 8 maintain wet dry ratio rainfall is a process in which observations of no rain also contain valuable information therefore the rainfall field ensemble is forced to contain the same percentage of zeros as the observational data this is achieved by ranking simulated grid values for each day and setting the lowermost fraction corresponding to the percentage of zeros in the observations to zero 3 2 6 step 9 neighborhood uncertainty if a rain gauge is sited according to e g guidelines published by the world meteorological organization wmo 2014 theoretically no physical obstacles should hinder the reception of rainfall any remaining environmental influences will be implicitly reflected in the rainfall measurement however the area represented by a measurement is limited it may range from several hundred square meters to several square kilometers and depends on factors such as physiographic homogeneity ibid once one is outside the representative area of a rain gauge i e up to multiple kilometers away from a gauge environmental factors are likely to change and alter the rainfall amount that reaches the ground given sufficient data statistical relationships between rainfall and these environmental factors may be established and used for spatial prediction of rainfall goovaerts 2000 for instance showed how orographic influence on rainfall can be incorporated into the interpolation of rainfall using kriging with external drift and cokriging yet it is not always possible to extract this kind of information from the data at hand either due to a mix of signals that is difficult to disentangle or due to a lack of survey data in these instances neighborhood uncertainty the uncertainty introduced by spatially varying but unknown environmental conditions arises neighborhood uncertainty is hence covering what otherwise cannot be explained deterministically environmental conditions include but are not limited to elevation land cover and anthropogenic structures due to the assumed permanent nature of these environmental factors and in contrast to sampling uncertainty we presume neighborhood uncertainty to be constant in time based on these considerations we propose to simulate neighborhood uncertainty as a random scaling field we suggest deriving the spatial dependence structure by examining long term average rainfall which we denote climatological rainfall following this rationale the differences remaining after trend correction step 3 in climatological rainfall are then attributable to the effect of environmental conditions that could not be captured deterministically we further assume that the spatial dependence structure variogram of the neighborhood uncertainty is proportional to the variogram of the climatological rainfall i e 6 Œ≥ h neighborhood Œ≥ h climatology thus we calculate the variogram for climatological rainfall and employ it for simulating the random scaling fields using sgs where the kriging estimate of neighborhood uncertainty at ungauged locations z neighborhood x 0 is obtained analogously to z x 0 in eq 3 the sgs generated random scaling field at an ungauged location z neighborhood sgs x 0 is then given by 7 z neighborhood sgs x 0 z neighborhood x 0 Œµ s 3 x 0 in which Œµ s 3 represents the random component of neighborhood uncertainty Œµ s 3 can be written as 8 Œµ s 3 x 0 n 0 œÉ o k neighborhood 2 x 0 with œÉ o k neighborhood 2 x 0 being the ordinary kriging variance related to the scaling field the final outcome the ensemble of rainfall fields z sgs final accounting for three sources of uncertainty is obtained by multiplication 9 z final sgs z sgs z neighborhood sgs 3 3 part iii evaluation after successful simulation the overall uncertainty of the rainfall field ensemble is quantified the uncertainty estimates should be compared with those obtained in other studies 4 set up and test of the stochastic rainfall model 4 1 estimation of model parameters 4 1 1 part i preprocessing to ascertain robust statistical analysis and variogram estimation the preprocessing was carried out at skjern catchment scale 2500 km2 using rainfall observations from 42 rain gauges part ii stochastic simulation was limited to ahlergaarde catchment using information from 14 gauges as conditioning data moreover we selected a subset of days for the preprocessing using the criterion of catchment wide nonzero rainfall this was done to prevent zero observations from influencing the shape of the variogram this selection criterion resulted in 230 days which were used for further analysis implications of only using days with catchment wide rainfall at the preprocessing stage will be discussed later 4 1 1 1 step 1 select transformation function we tested both a logarithmic and a square root transformation to approximate a gaussian distribution in line with findings by schuurmans et al 2007 the square root transformation yielded a better approximation of a gaussian distribution fig 3 and we chose it for further use while fig 3 reveals departures from the 1 1 line in the tail regions of the plot these concern data beyond three standard deviations of the mean according to the 68 95 99 7 rule ca 0 3 as such these are representative of extreme events which are not the focus of this study therefore we consider the deviations as negligible for the purpose of our work 4 1 1 2 step 2 analyze for spatial trends we calculated the coefficient of determination r2 for combinations of climatological rainfall and elevation as well as x distance to coast and y coordinate while no orographic influence was diagnosable analysis revealed a linear relationship between climatological rainfall and the distance to coast with r2 equal to 0 3 we used the corresponding regression relationship to remove the trend from the gauge data and considered it trend free i e stationary afterwards fig 4 4 1 1 3 step 3 estimate variogram while there are built in functions in scientific programming languages such as r and matlab that automatically fit a variogram model to the data we opted for a manually fitted pooled variogram a pooled variogram is obtained by averaging experimental variograms obtained for individual days for each distance lag see for example graler et al 2016 or muthusamy et al 2017 thus resulting in a variogram for average rainy conditions we chose the pooled variogram option over that of using daily variograms because the total number of available rain gauge stations n 42 at skjern catchment is below the 50 data points that are generally recommended to ensure a robust variogram webster oliver 2008 the pooled variogram was subsequently used for every rainy day at the stochastic simulation stage fig 5 shows the pooled variogram we fitted a spherical model to the data in order to derive the pooled variogram we normalized the rainfall data for each day i e calculating standard scores this required scaling using the variance of the respective day of the sill for each day during the stochastic simulation stage 4 1 2 part ii stochastic simulation 4 1 2 1 step 4 point measurement uncertainty as outlined in section 3 we employed perturbation factors to account for point measurement uncertainty to constrain the sampling of these factors we used the 5 reported as standard error for the bias correction method allerup et al 1997 hence the perturbation factors were drawn from a normal distribution with a mean equal to 1 and standard deviation equal to 0 05 i e point measurement uncertainty Œµ t 1 n 1 0 05 4 1 2 2 step 5 apply transformation the rainfall data were transformed using square root transformation see step 3 4 1 2 3 step 6 sampling uncertainty we used the stochastic simulation approach based on sgs and ok outlined in section 3 to generate an ensemble of 400 realizations of rainfall fields for every day in the simulation period years 2002 2006 n 1826 days 4 1 2 4 step 7 back transform after completion of the stochastic simulation we squared all values to obtain physical rainfall values 4 1 2 5 step 8 maintain wet dry ratio as described in the respective paragraph in the methodology section the rainfall field ensemble was forced to preserve the ratio of wet and dry observations to create intermittent rainfall fields 4 1 2 6 step 9 neighborhood uncertainty to account for neighborhood uncertainty we proceeded as follows we computed the average rainfall for each of the 42 rain gauges in skjern catchment using the available trend corrected step 3 17 year rainfall record 1990 2006 we considered the result to represent the climatological rainfall then we estimated the variogram for climatological rainfall the resulting experimental variogram spherical variogram model is given in fig 6 we assumed that the spatial dependence structure of climatological rainfall after trend correction is a result of the unknown environmental conditions that give rise to neighborhood uncertainty and that the variogram can be used to generate the random scaling fields representing neighborhood uncertainty to derive these random scaling fields we did the following first we assumed the neighborhood uncertainty at gauge locations and the area surrounding the gauges to be zero as environmental factors were assumed to be implicitly reflected by the measurements see section 3 step 9 this meant that each 2x2 km grid cell of the random scaling fields that contained a rain gauge was assigned a value of 1 no neighborhood uncertainty second we used sgs to generate an ensemble of 400 random scaling fields matching the number of realizations in the rainfall ensemble third to reproduce the spatial variability found for the climatological rainfall the variogram obtained for climatological rainfall was adjusted simply by rescaling the sill value field variance see table 1 finally to impose the effect of neighborhood uncertainty Œµ s 3 on the sgs simulated rainfall fields the random scaling fields were used to scale the back transformed sgs generated rainfall fields i e the ith realization of a rainfall field for every day in the simulation period was multiplied with the ith random scaling field 4 2 validation 4 2 1 reproduction of statistical distribution fig 7 shows qq plots for 5 out of 400 realizations generated at two selected dates a randomly chosen day from a summer period 3 august 2002 and a randomly chosen day from a winter period 11 january 2006 these dates belong to the 230 day subset with catchment wide rainfall introduced in section 4 1 and are used throughout this section for reasons of consistency the five realizations shown were selected in the following manner first the experimental variogram values for each realization were added second the realizations were ranked by the resulting sum third the realizations whose sum marked the 10th 25th 50th 75th and 90th percentile were chosen to be displayed in the figure for both selected days the quantile markers plot close to the bisector indicating that both the observed as well as the simulated values approximately follow the same distribution while the quantile markers are mostly located slightly above the 1 1 line for 3 august 2002 apart from the last quantile the markers for 11 january 2006 are mostly slightly below the 1 1 line these deviations can be explained by a combination of the effects of i the back transformation from square root transformed data into real space ii imbalance with regard to the number of values each quantile marker represents iii usage of a pooled variogram model instead of one derived for the respective day the linear structures in the qq plots result from five different quantile locations for each of the five realizations while the quantiles for the observations obviously remain the same the width of the linear structures indicates the spread of the ensemble given the fact that the two outer dots represent the 10th and 90th percentile respectively 4 2 2 reproduction of spatial distribution fig 8 shows experimental variograms for five realizations generated at the same two dates as before several observations can be made from fig 8 firstly all experimental variograms have a nugget well below that of the employed pooled variogram model pvm skj secondly already at short lag distances 10 km the experimental variograms overestimate the pooled variogram model these observation are also representative of the experimental variograms obtained for most other days of the 230 day subset a possible explanation for this mismatch is that the pooled variogram model used in the sgs pvm skj is derived based on data from 42 gauges at the skjern catchment scale section 4 1 while the simulations are carried out for the ahlergaarde subcatchment 14 gauges this indicates that the assumption of stationarity in space at least when examining individual days does not hold however from fig 8 it appears that the impact of the gauge data as conditioning data to a large extent outweighs the influence of the supplied pooled variogram model pvm skj for comparison the pooled variogram model for the ahlergaarde subcatchment pvm ahl is plotted as a dotted line what can be observed is that the experimental variograms of the five realizations approximate the pooled variogram model for the ahlergaarde subcatchment particularly with regard to the shape of the variogram and its range 5 simulation results 5 1 impact of temporal and spatial support on convergence fig 9 shows how the median black line of simulated rainfall converges to a stable value with increasing number of realizations used to calculate it to illustrate the impact of spatial support results are presented for two individual locations an arbitrarily selected rain gauge gauge location left hand column and an arbitrarily selected grid cell without a rain gauge ungauged location centre column and the catchment average obtained based on 317 grid cells right hand column the impact of temporal support is demonstrated by using different temporal supports one day one month 5 year period in case of the 5 year period uppermost row and two individual months a summer month and a winter month second and third row the rainfall is the average rainfall across a 5 year period and one month respectively the two days are the same that were used in section 4 2 validation in fig 9 the distance between the dashed grey lines can be used as a measure of uncertainty about the rainfall at the gauge location this difference is smallest fluctuations are solely caused by the point measurement uncertainty Œµ t 1 because the stochastic simulation preserves observations at gauge locations in contrast at the ungauged location the difference between the 25th and 75th percentile is significantly larger the larger variability in the simulated rainfall values as compared to that of the gauged location is a result of both the sampling uncertainty Œµ s t 2 and the neighborhood uncertainty Œµ s 3 finally the corresponding difference for the catchment average is somewhere in between that of gauged and ungauged location naturally this is a result of the spatial averaging across 317 grid values to obtain catchment average rainfall leading to a reduction in uncertainty the impact of temporal support on rainfall uncertainty is demonstrated in the centre column ungauged location in fig 9 note that the y axis is fixed for all panels within a row but varies from row to row for the 5 year average the resulting difference between 25th and 75th percentile is 0 1 mm signifying very little variation at month support june and december 2002 this difference is larger 1 mm and 0 2 mm respectively finally for daily support the difference between the 25th and the 75th percentiles is ca 10 mm and 3 mm respectively thus the larger the temporal support the smaller the resulting variability another observation is that the median oscillates significantly when calculated for only a few realizations but stabilizes soon thereafter at around 100 realizations for the 5 year period the oscillation continues until almost 300 realizations a side effect of the scaling of the y axis yet with a relatively small magnitude beyond ca 50 realizations however the fact that the median in most cases displays a stabilization already at around 100 realizations can be interpreted as an indicator that an ensemble size of 100 is sufficient to adequately represent uncertainty therefore we conclude that the ensemble of 400 used in the present study sufficiently represents the spatial heterogeneity of rainfall in the study area table 2 illustrates that the uncertainty expressed by the coefficient of variation cv is lowest for the 5 year period i e for largest temporal support and highest for individual days i e smallest temporal support for the gauged location the magnitude of the cv is exclusively controlled by the point scale uncertainty Œµ t 1 with regard to the two individual dates 3 aug 2002 and 11 jan 2006 the cv of around 5 agrees very well with the standard deviation used to characterise Œµ t 1 section 4 1 step 4 at the ungauged location the cv is considerably higher ranging from 5 to 72 this is a result of i the sampling uncertainty Œµ s t 2 and ii the neighborhood uncertainty Œµ s 3 the impact of Œµ s 3 becomes visible as the temporal support increases for the 5 year period adding the neighborhood uncertainty Œµ s 3 causes a threefold increase in the cv the same can be observed for the cv on the catchment average basically all three uncertainties contribute at point scale grid cell day averaging in time removes the effect of Œµ t 1 and Œµ s t 2 while averaging over space removes the effect of Œµ s t 2 and Œµ s 3 averaging over space and time removes the effect of all three and the removal is gradual 5 2 impact of temporal support on ensemble averages fig 10 presents rainfall ensemble averages left panel and ensemble standard deviations right panel with different temporal support one day one month and a 5 year period for the ahlergaarde subcatchment based on 400 realizations the ensemble averages with the largest temporal support 5 year period are seen to exhibit the smallest spread and range from ca 2 6 to 3 1 mm day depending on grid location the smaller the temporal support the larger is the spread in the ensemble average values approximately 7 and 40 mm day for one day support and 0 5 and 2 mm day for 1 month support common for all temporal supports is that spatial patterns are visible for example when looking at the 5 year period the smallest ensemble average values coincide with four individual gauge locations in the southwest to west and north to northeast of the catchment highest values are found further away from gauges where gauge density is low the overall image is relatively smooth with regard to the standard deviation of the ensemble averages a logical observation is that the lowest standard deviations are found at gauge locations here the variation is entirely controlled by the point measurement uncertainty Œµ t 1 in contrast the ensemble standard deviation increases with distance to a gauge location similar to what was observed before the larger the temporal support the smaller is the standard deviation on the ensemble average values note that ensemble averages do not reflect the spatial variability and correlation structure of rainfall fields table 3 shows the increase in cv when gradually including more sources of uncertainty into the simulation for different temporal support and two gauge network configurations complete network 14 gauges and reduced network 3 gauges the reduced network configuration was chosen to illustrate the consequences of recent shut downs of rain gauges in the study area for the simulated rainfall uncertainty the base case exhibits the highest cv 12 73 at the day scale and the lowest at the annual scale 0 67 aggregating temporally clearly leads to reduction in variation and hence smaller cvs with regard to the complete network including point measurement uncertainty Œµ t 1 leads to a notable increase in cv which is roughly the same for all temporal supports 25 5 26 9 when further adding neighborhood uncertainty Œµ s 3 differences become apparent while there is only a marginal increase to 26 6 at the day level the cv for monthly values from 26 5 to 36 5 increases notably whereas the cv for annual values increases significantly from 26 9 to 104 5 when looking at the reduced network a first observation is that as could be expected including fewer gauges into the simulation leads to a significant increase in cv at all temporal supports 76 1 79 1 when adding point measurement uncertainty Œµ t 1 there is once again an increase in cv this increase however is not as pronounced as for the complete network day level from 78 2 to 93 2 or an 8 4 increase if based on the cv of 22 69 this is due to the fact that a reduction in the number of gauges automatically implies that the impact of perturbing the observations with scaling factors carries less weight with regard to the simulated uncertainty finally when including neighborhood uncertainty Œµ s 3 a similar observation as for the complete network can be made while there is only a slight change in cv at day level the cv is increased threefold as compared to the base case by 295 5 5 3 evaluation of simulation results as a final part of the procedure depicted in the flow chart in fig 1 we evaluated the simulation results by comparing the uncertainty estimates from the simulation ensemble with those found in the expert elicitation study conducted by sebok et al 2016 when quantifying uncertainty based on the values simulated at gauge locations in the 5 year period 2002 2006 we obtain a cv of 0 24 in contrast the experts appraisal of uncertainty for point scale rainfall observations results in a cv of 2 with regard to the catchment scale the uncertainty cv calculated from the simulation ensemble in the 5 year period 2002 2006 is equal to 1 13 while the expert elicitation study reports a cv of 5 evidently there is a considerable mismatch between the uncertainty estimates obtained by means of expert elicitation and the stochastic simulation approach presented in this study this difference may be due to the large number of uncertainty sources ten for point scale rainfall considered in the expert elicitation study while we chose to incorporate point measurement uncertainty using only the uncertainty due to bias correction examples for other sources identified by the experts are observation record inhomogeneity instrument defect no detection of light drizzle snow capping and freezing conditions ibid hence a possibility to reduce the difference between the two uncertainty estimates would be to include one or more point scale uncertainties found by the experts some of these uncertainty sources imply uncertainties that are constant in time and space such as systematic instrument errors in a numerical experiment we therefore considered a fourth source of uncertainty Œµ 4 a systematic point measurement uncertainty assumed to be constant in space and time plausible for instance if rain gauges from a certain manufacturer were found to be systematically biased thus effectively being a multiplication factor for every ensemble time series if assumed gaussian the multiplication factors are then sampled from a normal distribution with a mean of 1 and a standard deviation of 2 and 5 which were considered to represent plausible values for systematic instrument errors respectively after applying these factors to the simulated ensemble the cv at catchment scale is found to be inflated to 2 30 and 5 1 respectively thus being considerably closer to the expert elicitation value while having no means to verify that a systematic uncertainty at point scale of 2 5 is correct and expert elicitation results obviously also are uncertain we argue that the uncertainty simulated using only the three considered sources of uncertainty appears unrealistically small furthermore we argue that the existence of some systematic uncertainty of the rain gauge observations appears realistic while the experts were selected based on a good knowledge of the measurement of precipitation their experience regarding geostatistical theories varied considerably accordingly they were not asked to quantify the space time correlation structure 6 discussion this paper presents an approach that allows considering three sources of rainfall uncertainty simultaneously we combine well established techniques to account for point measurement Œµ t 1 and sampling uncertainty Œµ s t 2 see for example kavetski et al 2006b balin et al 2010 or rakovec et al 2012 but propose a novel procedure that allows to incorporate neighborhood uncertainty Œµ s 3 into the uncertainty estimation in doing so it is our intent to introduce new elements into the discussion revolving around rainfall uncertainty quantification we hold on to our claim that the sources considered in our study are clearly differentiable from a conceptual point of view but we acknowledge that our study set up does not allow us to disentangle them in a mathematically rigorous manner thus we currently cannot verify whether the terms used to describe the uncertainties indeed capture what they are designed to capture while a bayesian framework may provide the theoretical basis for this previous applications while highly sophisticated in themselves have not considered more than one source of rainfall uncertainty kavetski et al 2003 ajami et al 2007 renard et al 2011 whether or not it would be feasible to devise a bayesian framework able to accommodate different sources of rainfall uncertainty will have to be researched further similarly the question of whether the overall rainfall uncertainty obtained using our approach is affected by cross compensation between different sources will have to be thoroughly examined by means of targeted experimentation in a follow up study in spite of this we hold that what we denote neighborhood uncertainty i e the uncertainty due to the temporally permanent effect of unknown environmental conditions on rainfall at ungauged locations has been disregarded so far in studies dealing with rainfall uncertainty analysis we would like to emphasize that neighborhood uncertainty is a theoretical construct that covers what otherwise cannot be explained deterministically this is in contrast to e g the well known effect of orography on rainfall goovaerts 2000 for instance demonstrated how given a statistically significant relationship elevation can be used in the spatial prediction of rainfall clark and slater 2006 illustrated how elevation and a several other physical attributes can be incorporated into a probabilistic approach to generate rainfall fields we found a similar notion to that of neighborhood uncertainty in an example from urban hydrology mcgrane 2016 and references therein where the author mentions that urban areas have an impact on rainfall through the heat island effect as well as aerosols yet this has apparently not led to a consideration in form of an uncertainty source similarly engeland et al 2016 mention unknown spatial trends that affect precipitation however they do not follow up on the issue in their study to the best of our knowledge no framework for the treatment of this source of uncertainty in a rainfall uncertainty context has been proposed so far potentially the sum metric model used in space time geostatistics could be employed to account for neighborhood point measurement and sampling uncertainty in a mathematically coherent manner the model distinguishes between purely spatial purely temporal and spatio temporal components graler et al 2016 what we label neighborhood uncertainty in this study essentially corresponds to the purely spatial since temporally persistent component of the sum metric model other examples for the application of the sum metric model are e g jost et al 2005 and kilibarda et al 2014 regardless of the approach one choses we are convinced that there are compelling reasons to account for neighborhood uncertainty one way or another after all when aiming for a more complete assessment of uncertainty and to avoid its underestimation it is necessary to find ways of describing and incorporating uncertainty sources even if they are hard to describe statistically mcmillan et al 2012 given our theoretical considerations specified in section 3 our results indicate that neighborhood uncertainty due to its assumed property of being constant in time strongly contributes to overall rainfall uncertainty at temporal and spatial scales relevant for water resource management therefore we suggest to further investigate neighborhood uncertainty especially in the context of catchment scale water management planning the second novelty of this paper is that the simulated rainfall uncertainty at both point and catchment scale is compared to the uncertainty estimates found in the course of an expert elicitation study sebok et al 2016 as was shown in section 5 3 the experts uncertainty estimates were several times higher than the ones obtained from the simulation we concluded that the simulation underestimated uncertainty due to omission of uncertainty sources the experts had considered arguably the two approaches are difficult to compare due to the obvious differences in methodology however we point out that one of the merits of expert elicitation is exactly the flexibility of being able to process information gathered by means of various different techniques at the same time and conflating it into uncertainty estimates while one has to be aware that these estimates inevitably are subjective and prone to personal bias there are methodological measures in place that ascertain the robustness of the method therefore we are convinced that expert elicitation is a promising tool that is able to supplement classical uncertainty estimation while we demonstrated that our stochastic simulation approach is flexible in that it is possible to account at least for the combined effect of the three sources of rainfall uncertainty and successfully reproduces key statistical features of the rainfall data we are aware of its limitations for example we consider the rainfall data to be trend free after correcting for a linear relationship between rainfall and distance to coast as the simulation based variograms on selected days indicate the assumption of stationarity after trend correction may not hold on the daily scale instead of treating the existing spatial trend prior to the stochastic simulation we could have attempted to incorporate the trend estimation into the simulation procedure see for example kyriakidis et al 2004 the authors carry out spatio temporal simulation of rainfall fields by differentiating between a deterministic trend and a stochastic residual component in a study presented by clark and slater 2006 the authors present a method that generates daily precipitation fields by including information related to the topography time invariant spatial attributes in the shape of a weighted regression relation into the estimation process furthermore we neglect temporal correlation in our stochastic simulation yet rakovec et al 2012 emphasize the relevance of accounting for temporal correlation and present a rainfall simulator for hourly time steps that conditions simulated rainfall fields on a certain number of previously simulated fields however following findings obtained by he et al 2011 we considered temporal correlation in the simulation of daily rainfall fields to be negligible we acknowledge that our model is therefore limited to the simulation of daily rainfall data and that it would not be valid for finer resolutions such as hourly values where temporal correlation would be important finally we employed a pooled variogram during the stochastic simulation stage while we did that to derive a variogram that was more robust than individual ones for each day and potentially based on very few data we are aware that this procedure possibly led to an overrepresentation of catchment wide frontal rainfall and that a variogram for convective rainfall might exhibit a shorter range however considering that frontal rainfall predominates in the study area we argue that this is a minor issue here 7 conclusion in the majority of studies addressing rainfall uncertainty the uncertainty is ascribed to a single source either point measurement or sampling uncertainty in proposing an approach that jointly considers three sources of uncertainty we leave well trodden paths in rainfall uncertainty estimation while we introduce new elements into rainfall uncertainty analysis to obtain a more comprehensive picture of overall rainfall uncertainty not that we do not provide a mathematically rigorous framework to disentangle the individual contributions still our analysis showed that the overall uncertainty on the average rainfall in a 5 year period was considerably larger than if only sampling uncertainty had been accounted for near threefold increase in the 5 year average of catchment rainfall from this we concluded that overall rainfall uncertainty is grossly underestimated if the additional sources had been neglected however when comparing our results to those of an expert elicitation for the same catchment sebok et al 2016 we found a considerable mismatch between the uncertainty estimates expert elicitation results in four times larger uncertainty for catchment average rainfall indicating that our approach may still be significantly underestimating actual uncertainty this gap could be reduced by including further sources of uncertainty identified by the experts into the simulation procedure and might be the focus of future work as the stochastic simulation approach presented in this study is flexible future application can be augmented by including more of these uncertainties having noted the significant difference between the expert elicitation study and our analysis it should be recognized that also the results of expert elicitation must be considered uncertain themselves we illustrated and more importantly quantified the effect of the individual sources of uncertainty on total rainfall uncertainty for different spatial and temporal support scales however we are aware that our findings are valid only within the domain of our assumptions to verify the validity of these assumptions additional data and further experimentation will be necessary bearing this in mind analysis of our results led to the following general observations overall rainfall uncertainty decreases as the temporal support increases this is attributable to temporal averaging and a corresponding loss of variation with regard to the uncertainty at point scale one has to distinguish between gauged and ungauged locations the uncertainty at gauged locations is rather small and a direct result of the incorporation of point measurement uncertainty in contrast the uncertainty at ungauged locations is a combination of both the sampling uncertainty accounted for by stochastic sampling during sgs and the additional variation injected by the point measurement uncertainty another general observation is that all three uncertainties contribute at the smallest temporal and spatial support grid day averaging in time removes the effect of point measurement and sampling uncertainty resulting in neighborhood uncertainty becoming increasingly dominant a similar effect is observed when the gauge network density is reduced averaging over space removes the effect of sampling and neigborhood uncertainty averaging over space and time removes the effect of all three sources of uncertainty the removal is gradual while our findings regarding the impact of changes to spatial temporal support and network density only confirm what had to be expected based on logical considerations increasing the support reduces uncertainty due to the averaging effect of large numbers we consider the observation that neighborhood uncertainty is prevailing for large temporal support to be a conclusion of importance and practical implications after all water resource management and planning commonly operates on annual time scales and at catchment size spatial scales therefore we think that the concept of neighborhood uncertainty i e the long term effect of unknown environmental conditions on rainfall amounts at ungauged locations should be integrated into rainfall uncertainty estimation especially when working on spatial and time scales frequently encountered in water resource management

6427,heterogeneities in textural properties of surficial formations at field scale result in spatial variations in hydraulic parameters governing unsaturated zone flow this study aims at quantifying the influence of such variations on solute transport resulting from a localized source of radioactive contaminant at ground level the study focuses on three hydraulic parameters related to the mualem van genuchten formalism namely the saturated hydraulic conductivity k s the parameter Œ± inversely proportional to the air entry value and the parameter n related to the pore size distribution sets of random fields accounting for spatial variability of these parameters are generated using lognormal distributions with different variances and correlation lengths these random fields are used as inputs to an unsaturated flow and transport model to simulate radionuclide plume migration each simulated plume is characterized by its size plume surface area position location of center of mass and shape elongation ratio within the unsaturated zone by comparison with the homogeneous medium k s Œ± and n random fields generated with the mean variances computed through the analysis of a global soil database respectively result in average in i 25 variable k s 20 variable Œ± and 65 variable n increase in plume size ii 0 8 1 and 1 8 m horizontal offsets of the plume center and iii 20 30 and 50 decrease in plume circularity in addition changes in the variance values within one order of magnitude appear to have critical consequences only for the n parameter the issue of spatial variability of hydraulic parameters is thus crucial for characterizing the evolution of pollutant plumes within an unsaturated zone and for developing better remediation strategies for industrial sites keywords richards equation mualem van genuchten model random fields radionuclide migration sensitivity analysis 1 introduction spatial heterogeneities found in porous formations at field scale impact groundwater flow and solute transport the role of geometrical patterns especially connected features in concentrating flow and reducing travel time has been widely highlighted in both saturated knudby and carrera 2005 renard and allard 2013 and unsaturated appels et al 2018 zones most of the related studies assume that such patterns mainly result from the arrangement of large scale discrete geological structures with high contrast in hydraulic parameters feyen and caers 2006 ye and khaleel 2008 the spatial distribution of these parameters can be represented by either several unimodal random fields populating a discontinuous facies model matheron et al 1987 le coz et al 2011 le coz et al 2013 or a single continuous random field whose properties are multimodal russo 2012 smaller scale variability i e within individual facies is known to contribute significantly to the overall hydraulic parameters variability within the unsaturated zone botros et al 2009 when considering such individual facies the corresponding parameters are generally represented by a single population whose distribution is unimodal more particularly lognormal for the hydraulic conductivity fogg et al 1998 paleologos et al 2015 tan et al 2017 and whose spatial variability can be characterized through a two point spatial covariance botros et al 2009 russo 2012 however identifying a relevant covariance model requires a large amount of data at field scale e g botros et al 2009 and is a complex task because the measurements of hydraulic parameters that govern unsaturated zone flow are difficult and time consuming schaap et al 2004 the spatial variability within individual facies is thus often neglected for instance in most of the studies that focus on the spread of radioactive contaminants in the unsaturated zone skuratoviƒç et al 2016 testoni et al 2017 in particular testoni et al 2017 simulated the barrier effect of the unsaturated zone as a delay and capture system by considering various medium configurations and initial conditions in case of an accidental release of cesium 137 these simulations were performed by coupling of i a distributed one dimensional unsaturated flow and transport model and ii a three dimensional saturated flow and transport model this coupling is thus based on the assumption that the unsaturated water flow is mainly in the vertical direction this commonly formulated assumption bugai et al 2012 jakimaviƒçi≈´tƒó maselienƒó et al 2016 is questionable since anisotropy induced by lateral variability in hydraulic parameters can refract flow lines away from vertical gannon et al 2017 this study aims at quantifying the influence of the spatial variability in hydraulic parameters on plume migration in unsaturated surficial formations within the framework of a punctual release of radionuclides to the subsurface first the degree of spatial variability in hydraulic parameters at field scale for typical soils is assessed based on the analysis of a global soil database then numerical simulations are run using a full two dimensional 2d flow and transport model to reproduce lateral flow induced by such spatial variability 2 unsaturated flow in porous media this section recalls the main parameters governing flow in unsaturated surficial formations and quantifies their spatial variability in natural environment the variance of three of these parameters is computed at field scale based on soil texture information recorded in a global soil database 2 1 governing equation and parameterization

hydraulic conductivity tensor l t 1 œà is the water pressure head l z is the vertical coordinate directed upward l and q ss represents distributed source positive or sink negative terms l3 l 3 t 1 solving the richards equation requires the moisture retention curve and the relative hydraulic conductivity function as inputs describing the links between pressure head water content and relative

1 n is a pore size distribution index and k s is the saturated hydraulic conductivity tensor l t 1 although the hydraulic parameters are linked to physical soil properties the direct measurement of some of them from samples is subject to experimental limitations schaap et al 2004 many investigations are thus undertaken to estimate hydraulic parameters using empirical relationships deduced from more readily available data such as soil texture and bulk density e g w√∂sten et al 1999 schaap et al 2001 saxton and rawls 2006 t√≥th et al 2015 zhang and schaap 2017 these relationships commonly referred as pedotransfer functions ptfs are mostly based on regression analysis of existing soil databases the rosetta ptf schaap et al 2001 is based on artificial neural network analysis coupled with bootstrap re sampling which allows to estimate hydraulic parameters of the mualem van genuchten model the parameter Œ∏ r can be quite precisely derived from soil texture using ptfs vereecken et al 1989 both Œ∏ r and Œ∏ s can be directly obtained from measurements under extremely dry or saturated conditions at the subsurface respectively jadoon et al 2012 in addition preliminary sensitivity analyses performed in temperate climate conditions show that the spatial variability of these two parameters does not significantly influence the solute transport the sensitivity analysis conducted in this study thus only focuses on the k s Œ± and n parameters 2 2 variability of hydraulic parameters at field scale 2 2 1 database analysis the world soil information service wosis aims at providing

step i e six years after the radionuclide injection in order to assess the influence of the variance of hydraulic parameters on the plume features the focus is first put on simulations with one hydraulic parameter varying table 3 sets 1 2 3 and then on simulations with the three parameters varying simultaneously table 3 sets 4 then the influence of the range values is described 4 1 sensitivity to the variance of one hydraulic parameter whatever the hydraulic parameter under consideration k s or Œ± or n the increase in the variance of the corresponding random field results both in the increase in the average plume surface areas from 220 corresponding to the homogeneous plume to 350 grid cells and in the variability of this surface areas standard deviation ranging from 0 corresponding to the homogeneous plume to 110 grid cells among the simulated plumes fig 5 the relationships between œÉ 2 and the surface areas of the plumes appear to be similar for the three hydraulic parameters under study when considering œÉ 2 log k s œÉ 2 log n 200 and œÉ 2 log k s œÉ 2 log Œ± 5 in addition the increase in variance for any hydraulic parameter results in the increase of the offset in both directions of the mean center of mass regarding the center of the homogeneous plume fig 6 the trend is yet stronger in the horizontal direction mean offsets ranging from 0 5 to 2 m than in the vertical direction offsets ranging from 0 5 to 0 7 m besides the relationships between œÉ 2 and the offsets are similar when considering œÉ 2 log k s œÉ 2 log n 200 and œÉ 2 log k s œÉ 2 log Œ± 5 finally the increase in variance results in the decrease of the elongation ratio from 0 88 corresponding to the homogeneous plume to 0 45 regardless of which hydraulic parameter is considered fig 7 thus when the variability of hydraulic parameters is high pollutant plumes are more likely to have an elongated shape besides the relationships between œÉ 2 and the offsets are similar when considering œÉ 2 log k s œÉ 2 log n 200 and œÉ 2 log k s œÉ 2 log Œ± 5 4 2 sensitivity to the variance of the three hydraulic parameters the mean and standard deviation of the plume surface areas the mean offsets between each centers and the homogeneous center and the mean elongation ratios are computed for sets of 100 simulations with the three parameters varying simultaneously and in a correlated manner with œÉ 2 log k s œÉ 2 log n 200 and œÉ 2 log k s œÉ 2 log Œ± 5 these features are close to the values obtained for the sets with only one parameter varying considering the corresponding variances figs 5 7 here the results are given for a coefficient r of 0 8 other values of r coefficient have been tested and lead to similar results 4 3 sensitivity to the ranges given the values of œÉ 2 Œ¥ x and Œ¥ z chosen for this sensitivity analysis the range in the horizontal direction Œ¥ x does not seem to have a significant influence on the simulated plume features size center of mass and shape regardless of which hydraulic parameter is considered fig 8 the influence of the range in the vertical direction Œ¥ z appears to be slightly more visible fig 9 especially regarding the mean plume surface areas and the location of the mean centers of mass when the vertical range increases from 1 to 5 m the mean plume surface areas decrease especially for k s and n diminution from 300 to 250 and from 290 to 260 grid cells respectively and the horizontal offsets regarding the homogeneous plume center increase of around 0 3 m for the three hydraulic parameters 4 4 additional tests when considering a reactive radionuclide r 3 the simulated plumes are logically less developed than for the ideal groundwater tracer r 1 however both the surface area and the related standard deviation increase significantly when the variance of each of the three hydraulic parameters considered increase these features tend to stabilize when the average surface reaches about 130 of the surface simulated in a homogenous medium consistently with the results for tritium fig 10 the results obtained with mean hydraulic parameters related to a finer texture silty clay loam are similar to those above presented for sandy loam fig 10a this could be explained by the fact that silty clay loam mean properties remain sufficiently favorable for leading the infiltration of the water height imposed at the top surface of the model fig 3b the standard deviation computed for highest variances of the hydraulic parameters is yet lower fig 10b this could be explained by the fact that a large distribution of the hydraulic parameters centered on sandy loam material could result in very high hydraulic conductivity values more favorable to the development of preferential flow paths and therefore to the lateral migration of the plume 5 discussion this study allows to quantify the impact of the variance of the random fields representing the logarithms of the hydraulic parameters k s Œ± and n on solute transport within unsaturated surficial formations by focusing on variances estimated for porous media in natural environment at field scale it appears that the n and in a lesser extent k s parameters are the most critical figs 5 7 thus by comparison with homogeneous parameter fields random fields generated with œÉ 2 log k s 0 14 œÉ 2 log Œ± 0 036 and œÉ 2 log n 0 005 i e mean variances calculated based on the wosis database respectively result in i 25 20 and 65 increase in plume size ii 0 8 1 and 1 8 m horizontal offsets of the plume center and iii 20 30 and 50 decrease in plume circularity besides within the range of variation of œÉ 2 log n the average surface areas range from 260 to 350 grid cells in comparison within the range of variation of œÉ 2 log k s and œÉ 2 log Œ± the mean surface areas only range from 235 to 290 which highlights that n is the most critical parameter such results are consistent with previous studies showing the high influence of the spatial variability of the parameter n on flow lu and zhang 2002 and tan et al 2017 in the unsaturated zone this study also shows that the simulated plumes are far less sensitive to changes in ranges than changes in variances of the random fields representing the hydraulic parameters at least for the intervals of values chosen yet the impact of the vertical range appears to be more pronounced than the horizontal range when the zones of high or low values of hydraulic parameters are more expanded in depth higher value of vertical ranges the preferential flow paths are potentially more continuous and the plume surface areas tend to decrease and get closer to the homogeneous plume surface area the values of horizontal ranges considered here are of the same order of magnitude as the pollutant plumes extensions a few meters it could explain the low influence of the changes in horizontal range on the simulated plumes nevertheless these ranges are consistent with analyses of soil parameter variability at field scale russo et al 1997 and botros et al 2009 however for higher values of ranges from hundreds of meters to a thousand meter the influence of horizontal range on the flow rate in unsaturated zone was shown to be more significant tan et al 2017 the sensitivity analysis performed in this study mainly focuses on an ideal groundwater tracer tritium in sandy texture however additional tests show that the results obtained for reactive radionuclides and a finer texture are comparable at least for similar infiltration rate from a general standpoint this study thus indicates that taking into account the weak intra facies small scale spatial variability is critical for characterizing plume migration within unsaturated zone this requires to develop in situ approaches for estimating more efficiently soil hydraulic parameters and their variability at field scale e g l√©ger et al 2014 l√©ger et al 2016 when these parameters remain poorly recognized a set of simulations based on typical variability deduced from local or global database can be used for identifying the plume properties and the related uncertainties at a given time 6 conclusion this work has highlighted the critical influence of the spatial variability in hydraulic parameters in particular pore size distribution index n on radionuclide migration in unsaturated surficial formations in practice this work demonstrates the need for well characterizing this spatial variability in order to quantify and locate soil volumes that need to be removed or depolluted in the context of remediation of nuclear or industrial sites it also quantifies the corresponding uncertainties in addition although the quantitative results presented in this paper are related to a theoretical example and are dependent on the model settings environmental parameters radionuclide etc the proposed method random field generation physically based groundwater transport simulations plume properties characterization can be

6427,heterogeneities in textural properties of surficial formations at field scale result in spatial variations in hydraulic parameters governing unsaturated zone flow this study aims at quantifying the influence of such variations on solute transport resulting from a localized source of radioactive contaminant at ground level the study focuses on three hydraulic parameters related to the mualem van genuchten formalism namely the saturated hydraulic conductivity k s the parameter Œ± inversely proportional to the air entry value and the parameter n related to the pore size distribution sets of random fields accounting for spatial variability of these parameters are generated using lognormal distributions with different variances and correlation lengths these random fields are used as inputs to an unsaturated flow and transport model to simulate radionuclide plume migration each simulated plume is characterized by its size plume surface area position location of center of mass and shape elongation ratio within the unsaturated zone by comparison with the homogeneous medium k s Œ± and n random fields generated with the mean variances computed through the analysis of a global soil database respectively result in average in i 25 variable k s 20 variable Œ± and 65 variable n increase in plume size ii 0 8 1 and 1 8 m horizontal offsets of the plume center and iii 20 30 and 50 decrease in plume circularity in addition changes in the variance values within one order of magnitude appear to have critical consequences only for the n parameter the issue of spatial variability of hydraulic parameters is thus crucial for characterizing the evolution of pollutant plumes within an unsaturated zone and for developing better remediation strategies for industrial sites keywords richards equation mualem van genuchten model random fields radionuclide migration sensitivity analysis 1 introduction spatial heterogeneities found in porous formations at field scale impact groundwater flow and solute transport the role of geometrical patterns especially connected features in concentrating flow and reducing travel time has been widely highlighted in both saturated knudby and carrera 2005 renard and allard 2013 and unsaturated appels et al 2018 zones most of the related studies assume that such patterns mainly result from the arrangement of large scale discrete geological structures with high contrast in hydraulic parameters feyen and caers 2006 ye and khaleel 2008 the spatial distribution of these parameters can be represented by either several unimodal random fields populating a discontinuous facies model matheron et al 1987 le coz et al 2011 le coz et al 2013 or a single continuous random field whose properties are multimodal russo 2012 smaller scale variability i e within individual facies is known to contribute significantly to the overall hydraulic parameters variability within the unsaturated zone botros et al 2009 when considering such individual facies the corresponding parameters are generally represented by a single population whose distribution is unimodal more particularly lognormal for the hydraulic conductivity fogg et al 1998 paleologos et al 2015 tan et al 2017 and whose spatial variability can be characterized through a two point spatial covariance botros et al 2009 russo 2012 however identifying a relevant covariance model requires a large amount of data at field scale e g botros et al 2009 and is a complex task because the measurements of hydraulic parameters that govern unsaturated zone flow are difficult and time consuming schaap et al 2004 the spatial variability within individual facies is thus often neglected for instance in most of the studies that focus on the spread of radioactive contaminants in the unsaturated zone skuratoviƒç et al 2016 testoni et al 2017 in particular testoni et al 2017 simulated the barrier effect of the unsaturated zone as a delay and capture system by considering various medium configurations and initial conditions in case of an accidental release of cesium 137 these simulations were performed by coupling of i a distributed one dimensional unsaturated flow and transport model and ii a three dimensional saturated flow and transport model this coupling is thus based on the assumption that the unsaturated water flow is mainly in the vertical direction this commonly formulated assumption bugai et al 2012 jakimaviƒçi≈´tƒó maselienƒó et al 2016 is questionable since anisotropy induced by lateral variability in hydraulic parameters can refract flow lines away from vertical gannon et al 2017 this study aims at quantifying the influence of the spatial variability in hydraulic parameters on plume migration in unsaturated surficial formations within the framework of a punctual release of radionuclides to the subsurface first the degree of spatial variability in hydraulic parameters at field scale for typical soils is assessed based on the analysis of a global soil database then numerical simulations are run using a full two dimensional 2d flow and transport model to reproduce lateral flow induced by such spatial variability 2 unsaturated flow in porous media this section recalls the main parameters governing flow in unsaturated surficial formations and quantifies their spatial variability in natural environment the variance of three of these parameters is computed at field scale based on soil texture information recorded in a global soil database 2 1 governing equation and parameterization variably saturated flow processes in porous media are typically described by the richards equation 1 Œ∏ œà t k œà œà z q ss where Œ∏ is the volumetric moisture content l3 l 3 t is the time t k is the hydraulic conductivity tensor l t 1 œà is the water pressure head l z is the vertical coordinate directed upward l and q ss represents distributed source positive or sink negative terms l3 l 3 t 1 solving the richards equation requires the moisture retention curve and the relative hydraulic conductivity function as inputs describing the links between pressure head water content and relative hydraulic conductivity these relationships are based on a model e g the mualem van genuchten model mualem 1976 van genuchten 1980 2 Œ∏ œà Œ∏ r Œ∏ s Œ∏ r 1 Œ± œà n m with m 1 1 n and 3 k œà k s s e 1 2

1 n is a pore size distribution index and k s is the saturated hydraulic conductivity tensor l t 1 although the hydraulic parameters are linked to physical soil properties the direct measurement of some of them from samples is subject to experimental limitations schaap et al 2004 many investigations are thus undertaken to estimate hydraulic parameters using empirical relationships deduced from more readily available data such as soil texture and bulk density e g w√∂sten et al 1999 schaap et al 2001 saxton and rawls 2006 t√≥th et al 2015 zhang and schaap 2017 these relationships commonly referred as pedotransfer functions ptfs are mostly based on regression analysis of existing soil databases the rosetta ptf schaap et al 2001 is based on artificial neural network analysis coupled with bootstrap re sampling which allows to estimate hydraulic parameters of the mualem van genuchten model the parameter Œ∏ r can be quite precisely derived from soil texture using ptfs vereecken et al 1989 both Œ∏ r and Œ∏ s can be directly obtained from measurements under extremely dry or saturated conditions at the subsurface respectively jadoon et al 2012 in addition preliminary sensitivity analyses performed in temperate climate conditions show that the spatial variability of these two parameters does not significantly influence the solute transport the sensitivity analysis conducted in this study thus only focuses on the k s Œ± and n parameters 2 2 variability of hydraulic parameters at field scale 2 2 1 database analysis the world soil information service wosis aims at providing

step i e six years after the radionuclide injection in order to assess the influence of the variance of hydraulic parameters on the plume features the focus is first put on simulations with one hydraulic parameter varying table 3 sets 1 2 3 and then on simulations with the three parameters varying simultaneously table 3 sets 4 then the influence of the range values is described 4 1 sensitivity to the variance of one hydraulic parameter whatever the hydraulic parameter under consideration k s or Œ± or n the increase in the variance of the corresponding random field results both in the increase in the average plume surface areas from 220 corresponding to the homogeneous plume to 350 grid cells and in the variability of this surface areas standard deviation ranging from 0 corresponding to the homogeneous plume to 110 grid cells among the simulated plumes fig 5 the relationships between œÉ 2 and the surface areas of the plumes appear to be similar for the three hydraulic parameters under study when considering œÉ 2 log k s œÉ 2 log n 200 and œÉ 2 log k s œÉ 2 log Œ± 5 in addition the increase in variance for any hydraulic parameter results in the increase of the offset in both directions of the mean center of mass regarding the center of the homogeneous plume fig 6 the trend is yet stronger in the horizontal direction mean offsets ranging from 0 5 to 2 m than in the vertical direction offsets ranging from 0 5 to 0 7 m besides the relationships between œÉ 2 and the offsets are similar when considering œÉ 2 log k s œÉ 2 log n 200 and œÉ 2 log k s œÉ 2 log Œ± 5 finally the increase in variance results in the decrease of the elongation ratio from 0 88 corresponding to the homogeneous plume to 0 45 regardless of which hydraulic parameter is considered fig 7 thus when the variability of hydraulic parameters is high pollutant plumes are more likely to have an elongated shape besides the relationships between œÉ 2 and the offsets are similar when considering œÉ 2 log k s œÉ 2 log n 200 and œÉ 2 log k s œÉ 2 log Œ± 5 4 2 sensitivity to the variance of the three hydraulic parameters the mean and standard deviation of the plume surface areas the mean offsets between each centers and the homogeneous center and the mean elongation ratios are computed for sets of 100 simulations with the three parameters varying simultaneously and in a correlated manner with œÉ 2 log k s œÉ 2 log n 200 and œÉ 2 log k s œÉ 2 log Œ± 5 these features are close to the values obtained for the sets with only one parameter varying considering the corresponding variances figs 5 7 here the results are given for a coefficient r of 0 8 other values of r coefficient have been tested and lead to similar results 4 3 sensitivity to the ranges given the values of œÉ 2 Œ¥ x and Œ¥ z chosen for this sensitivity analysis the range in the horizontal direction Œ¥ x does not seem to have a significant influence on the simulated plume features size center of mass and shape regardless of which hydraulic parameter is considered fig 8 the influence of the range in the vertical direction Œ¥ z appears to be slightly more visible fig 9 especially regarding the mean plume surface areas and the location of the mean centers of mass when the vertical range increases from 1 to 5 m the mean plume surface areas decrease especially for k s and n diminution from 300 to 250 and from 290 to 260 grid cells respectively and the horizontal offsets regarding the homogeneous plume center increase of around 0 3 m for the three hydraulic parameters 4 4 additional tests when considering a reactive radionuclide r 3 the simulated plumes are logically less developed than for the ideal groundwater tracer r 1 however both the surface area and the related standard deviation increase significantly when the variance of each of the three hydraulic parameters considered increase these features tend to stabilize when the average surface reaches about 130 of the surface simulated in a homogenous medium consistently with the results for tritium fig 10 the results obtained with mean hydraulic parameters related to a finer texture silty clay loam are similar to those above presented for sandy loam fig 10a this could be explained by the fact that silty clay loam mean properties remain sufficiently favorable for leading the infiltration of the water height imposed at the top surface of the model fig 3b the standard deviation computed for highest variances of the hydraulic parameters is yet lower fig 10b this could be explained by the fact that a large distribution of the hydraulic parameters centered on sandy loam material could result in very high hydraulic conductivity values more favorable to the development of preferential flow paths and therefore to the lateral migration of the plume 5 discussion this study allows to quantify the impact of the variance of the random fields representing the logarithms of the hydraulic parameters k s Œ± and n on solute transport within unsaturated surficial formations by focusing on variances estimated for porous media in natural environment at field scale it appears that the n and in a lesser extent k s parameters are the most critical figs 5 7 thus by comparison with homogeneous parameter fields random fields generated with œÉ 2 log k s 0 14 œÉ 2 log Œ± 0 036 and œÉ 2 log n 0 005 i e mean variances calculated based on the wosis database respectively result in i 25 20 and 65 increase in plume size ii 0 8 1 and 1 8 m horizontal offsets of the plume center and iii 20 30 and 50 decrease in plume circularity besides within the range of variation of œÉ 2 log n the average surface areas range from 260 to 350 grid cells in comparison within the range of variation of œÉ 2 log k s and œÉ 2 log Œ± the mean surface areas only range from 235 to 290 which highlights that n is the most critical parameter such results are consistent with previous studies showing the high influence of the spatial variability of the parameter n on flow lu and zhang 2002 and tan et al 2017 in the unsaturated zone this study also shows that the simulated plumes are far less sensitive to changes in ranges than changes in variances of the random fields representing the hydraulic parameters at least for the intervals of values chosen yet the impact of the vertical range appears to be more pronounced than the horizontal range when the zones of high or low values of hydraulic parameters are more expanded in depth higher value of vertical ranges the preferential flow paths are potentially more continuous and the plume surface areas tend to decrease and get closer to the homogeneous plume surface area the values of horizontal ranges considered here are of the same order of magnitude as the pollutant plumes extensions a few meters it could explain the low influence of the changes in horizontal range on the simulated plumes nevertheless these ranges are consistent with analyses of soil parameter variability at field scale russo et al 1997 and botros et al 2009 however for higher values of ranges from hundreds of meters to a thousand meter the influence of horizontal range on the flow rate in unsaturated zone was shown to be more significant tan et al 2017 the sensitivity analysis performed in this study mainly focuses on an ideal groundwater tracer tritium in sandy texture however additional tests show that the results obtained for reactive radionuclides and a finer texture are comparable at least for similar infiltration rate from a general standpoint this study thus indicates that taking into account the weak intra facies small scale spatial variability is critical for characterizing plume migration within unsaturated zone this requires to develop in situ approaches for estimating more efficiently soil hydraulic parameters and their variability at field scale e g l√©ger et al 2014 l√©ger et al 2016 when these parameters remain poorly recognized a set of simulations based on typical variability deduced from local or global database can be used for identifying the plume properties and the related uncertainties at a given time 6 conclusion this work has highlighted the critical influence of the spatial variability in hydraulic parameters in particular pore size distribution index n on radionuclide migration in unsaturated surficial formations in practice this work demonstrates the need for well characterizing this spatial variability in order to quantify and locate soil volumes that need to be removed or depolluted in the context of remediation of nuclear or industrial sites it also quantifies the corresponding uncertainties in addition although the quantitative results presented in this paper are related to a theoretical example and are dependent on the model settings environmental parameters radionuclide etc the proposed method random field generation physically based groundwater transport simulations plume properties characterization can be transposed to other contexts such as chemical pollutions or design of devices to contain pollutant spread conflict of interest none acknowledgements this study is part of kri terres project supported

6428,remote sensing data are frequently incorporated into drought indices used widely by research and management communities to assess and diagnose current and historic drought events the integrated drought indices combine multiple indicators and reflect drought conditions from a range of perspectives i e hydrological agricultural meteorological however the success of most remote sensing based drought indices is constrained by geographic regions since their performance strongly depends on environmental factors such as land cover type temperature and soil moisture to address this limitation we propose a framework for a new integrated drought index that performs well across diverse climate regions our framework uses a geographically weighted regression model and principal component analysis to composite a range of vegetation and meteorological indices derived from multiple remote sensing platforms and in situ drought indices developed from meteorological station data our new index which we call the station enabled geographically independent integrated drought index giidi station compared favorably with other common drought indices such as microwave integrated drought index midi optimized meteorological drought index omdi precipitation condition index pci temperature condition index tci soil moisture condition index smci and vegetation condition index vci using pearson correlation analyses between remote sensing and in situ drought indices during the growing season april to october from 2002 to 2011 we show that giidi station had the best correlations with in situ drought indices across the entire study region of the continental united states the performance of giidi station was not affected by common environmental factors such as precipitation temperature land cover and soil conditions taken together our results suggest that giidi station has considerable potential to improve our ability of monitoring drought at regional scales provided

pattern decomposition method keywords climate change conus drought monitoring giidi station gwr pca 1 introduction there is an increasing need for comprehensive and reliable drought monitoring to aid planning and mitigation of drought impacts since the frequency and consequences of droughts are expected to intensify under climate change halwatura et al 2017 keyantash and dracup 2004 wilhelmi and wilhite 2002 zhou et al 2012 historically droughts have been classified and assessed using point observations from networks of meteorological stations for instance the widely used standardized precipitation index spi which is the world meteorological organization s wmo recommended indicator for meteorological drought is based on ground based precipitation observations hayes et al 1999 mckee et al 1993 more recently global and near real time observations of remote sensing technology open the door for comprehensively characterizing drought conditions regionally and globally especially in regions with limited sampling gauges jiao et al 2019 lu et al 2016 rhee et al 2010 wang et al 2012 wu et al 2013 zhang et al 2017 various drought indices building on remote sensing observations have been developed to estimate drought conditions table 1 provides a summary of the commonly used drought indices however many of the existing remote sensing drought indices are linked to a single biophysical variable e g precipitation soil moisture greenness and may not be sufficient to capture the complex processes and diverse impacts of drought aghakouchak et al 2015 hao and singh 2015 there is an urgent need to develop integrated indices which could combine station data and remote sensing observations to alleviate the shortcomings of drought characterization from a single index several studies have focused on developing integrated remote sensing drought indices to provide a more robust and comprehensive estimation of drought for example the microwave integrated drought index midi zhang and jia 2013 scaled drought condition index sdci rhee et al 2010 optimized meteorological drought index omdi and optimized vegetation drought index ovdi hao et al 2015 synthesized drought index sdi du et al 2013 combined variables from multiple perspectives e g soil moisture condition index smci precipitation condition index pci temperature condition index tci and vegetation condition index vci these indices have been shown to perform well in selected study areas du et al 2013 hao et al 2015 rhee et al 2010 zhang and jia 2013 a major challenge for these integrated remote sensing indices is their relatively poor performance when applied to climate regions different from those in which they were developed since they were optimized under a narrow range of environmental conditions another major issue is their inability to adequately represent spatial variability due to their reliance on traditional composition methods park et al 2016 specifically it is often assumed that all areas within a study region contribute the same weight for a particular single index this type of integration is straightforward to implement and is commonly used to develop multivariate drought indices however this type of integration is not well suited for capturing the covariability of drought related indices since it may miss local details that can be significant if the relationship of the related indices is spatially non stationary aghakouchak et al 2015 a third limitation is that traditionally integrated drought indices only use a single in situ based drought index as the dependent variable to combine the multi source remote sensing data for example ovdi uses spi as the dependent variable to determine the weights of pci tci smci and vci hao et al 2015 similarly vegetation drought response index vegdri only uses palmer drought severity index pdsi as the dependent variable to composite multi source data brown et al 2008 however only one dependent variable may not be sufficient to estimate comprehensive drought conditions as they affect hydrological vegetative and meteorological conditions for the regions with both station data and remote sensing images the integration of ground observation information from multiple perspectives and the remote sensing observations from multi sensors could be a better way to comprehensively monitor drought to address these issues the objective of this study is to develop and evaluate a new integrated drought index based on multi sensor remote sensing data for drought monitoring under different climate conditions in this study geographically weighted regression gwr model and principal component analysis pca were used to composite and integrate multiple remote sensing based drought indices gwr and pca were used because they can take the local details into consideration e g using different weights in different parts of the study area for a particular single index thus the newly developed index can be applied to diverse climate regions we also used three in situ based drought indices pdsi moisture anomaly index z index and spi as dependent variables to composite multi source single indices we call the new product the station enabled geographically independent integrated drought index giidi station indicating its universal applicability for diverse climate regions to evaluate the performance of giidi station it was compared with both integrated drought indices midi omdi and single drought indices pci tci vci and smci we also evaluated whether environmental factors impact the performance of giidi station across spatial climate gradients 2 data both in situ and remote sensing datasets were used to develop and assess the performance of our giidi station these data were also used to compare giidi stations s performance with other remote sensing based drought indices in various climate divisions over the continental united states conus focusing on the growing season from 2002 to 2011 the product of advanced microwave scanning radiometer for eos amsr e was used in the development of giidi station and the amsr e data was available from 2002 to 2011 2 1 in situ based drought indices three monthly in situ drought indices pdsi moisture anomaly index z index and standardized precipitation index spi were selected for incorporation into giidi station because they are among the most commonly used indicators for drought monitoring in the united states these in situ drought indices which provide general assessment of soil moisture and precipitation conditions were obtained from the noaa s national climatic data center ncdc noaa repository for 344 climatic divisions in the conus http www1 ncdc noaa gov pub data cirs these selected in situ indices also have been widely applied by various studies to evaluate remote sensing drought indices brown et al 2008 caccamo et al 2011 ji and peters 2003 rhee et al 2010 in our study the pdsi z index and spi from 1012 observation stations were used as training data and climate division level based pdsi z index and spi were used as evaluation data 2 2 remote sensing data four remote based drought indices moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer modis data based vci and tci amsr e based smci and trmm based pci were selected for incorporation into giidi station these four remote sensing based drought indices estimate drought conditions from unique perspectives the vci which is derived from vegetation index based on the universal pattern decomposition method viupd estimates drought conditions based on vegetative response it was calculated using modis land surface data mod09a1 downloaded from the land processes distributed active center lpdaac http lpdaac usgs gov tci describes temperature anomaly during the drought events monthly tci was calculated using modis land surface temperature lst data mod11a2 which was obtained from the national aeronautics and space administration s nasa earth observing system data and information system eosdis http reverb echo nasa gov pci provides information on precipitation deficiency it was calculated based on trmm 3b43 data which was available at the nasa data and information services center disc http mirador gsfc nasa gov smci was selected to describe the soil moisture perspective we compute smci based on the amsr e product obtained from vrije universtiteit amsterdam http nsidc org 2 3 other data united states drought monitor usdm data was chosen as a proxy for evaluating the performance of giidi station usdm combines information from multiple ground observation based drought indicators and local reports from state climatologists and observers throughout the country and it is used as a trigger for federal drought relief programs brown et al 2008 hayes et al 2012 the usdm map has a spatial resolution at the approximate scale of a climate division svoboda et al 2002 the usdm classifies droughts as d0 abnormally dry d1 moderate drought d2 severe drought d3 extreme drought and d4 exceptional drought events detailed information about usdm is available at http drought unl dm in order to further evaluate the performance of giidi station nine additional datasets including land use land cover lulc data climate data and soil data were selected to explore whether the performance of giidi station for drought monitoring depends on common environmental factors the u s geological survey national land cover data nlcd http landcover usgs gov was used to describe lulc state mean annual precipitation and temperature data were selected to describe climate conditions data on estimated mean annual precipitation and temperature in each climate division was obtained from the oregon state university prism group http prism oregonstate edu and disc http mirador gsfc nasa gov respectively information on five soil properties including permeability water table depth available water holding capacity hydrologic groups and soil drainage were obtained from the center for environmental informatics at penn state university http www soilinfo psu edu a more detailed description of these indices is available from quiring and ganesh 2010 3 methodology to develop the composite giidi station index we first calculated vci using viupd instead of the commonly used ndvi since the former has been shown to better estimate drought conditions jiao et al 2016 next we used the gwr model to composite tci vci pci and smci we used three different in situ drought indices spi pdsi and z index as the dependent variables to composite the remote sensing based condition indices tci vci pci and smci there are three outcomes of gwr model based composition spi targeted integrated drought index pdsi targeted integrated drought index and z index targeted integrated drought index the pca method was then used to composite these three outcomes of the gwr into giidi station to validate the product we first evaluated the correlation between in situ drought indices and giidi station in different climate divisions then the lulc data climate data and soil data were used to explore whether the performance of giidi station for drought estimation was affected by lulc precipitation temperature and soil conditions more details about our methodology are given in sections 3 1 3 3 and the overall approach is illustrated in fig 1 3 1 scaled remote sensing indices table 1 shows detailed information about the remote sensing based drought indices used in this study to reiterate tci pci vci and smci were used to develop giidi station while midi and omdi were used to assess its drought monitoring performance the analysis in this study focused primarily on the months from april to october in order to avoid noise from the snow and ice in the winter 3 2 giidi station development and evaluation the development of giidi station incorporated in situ drought indices spi pdsi and z index from 1012 observation stations supplementary material fig 1 shows the locations of the observation stations giidi station was calculated using gwr model based on the following equations 1 y Œ≤ 0 Œº v Œ≤ 1 Œº v tci Œ≤ 2 Œº v vci Œ≤ 3 Œº v pci Œ≤ 4 Œº v smci 2 y spi pdsi z i n d e x where Œº v denotes the geographical coordinates of the 1012 observation stations Œ≤ i Œº v represents the weighting of single indices tci vci pci and smci y is the dependent variable which includes the three widely used in situ drought indices spi pdsi and z index in geographically weighted regression the parameter estimates are made using an approach in which the contribution of a sample to the analysis is weighted based on its spatial proximity to the specific location under consideration data from observations close to the location under consideration are weighted more than data from observations further away the parameters were estimated from 3 Œ≤ Œº v x t w Œº v x 1 x t w Œº v y where Œ≤ Œº v represents an estimate of Œ≤ w Œº v is the weighting matrix which ensures that observations close to the location at which the parameter estimates are to be made have more influence on the analysis than those further away w Œº v is a matrix of weights relative to the position of Œº v in our study area w Œº v is computed from a weighting scheme that is also known as a kernel fotheringham et al 1998 gaussian shaped kernel was used in our study 4 w i u v e 0 5 d i u v h 2 where w i u v is the geographical weight of the ith observation relative to the location u v and u v is the coordinate of observation points d i u v is the distance between the grid cells and the location u v h is known as the bandwidth in our study the bandwidth was determined based on the corrected akaike information criterion aicc hurvich et al 1998 which takes the form below 5 a i c c 2 n l o g e œÉ n l o g e 2 œÄ n n t r s n 2 t r s where n is the number of observations in the dataset œÉ is the estimate of the standard deviation of the residuals and tr s is the trace of the hat matrix the optimum of h could be found based on the least aicc in this study gwr model was established using arcpy module in python given that there were three different in situ based drought indices spi pdsi and z index as the dependent variables in eq 1 there were three outcomes of the gwr model spi targeted integrated drought indices pdsi targeted integrated drought indices and z index targeted integrated drought indices in order to better integrate these three gwr model outputs into one variable the pca method was used to composite the three different outcomes into giidi station see eqs 6 and 7 the basic purpose of using pca is to reduce the dimensionality of a data set from a large set of variables into a small set of variables wold et al 1987 the first principal component pc1 of the pca was selected and the values of the pc1 were normalized as the range of 6 to 6 in corresponding to the range of pdsi then the normalized pc1 was defined as giidi station since it accounts for as much of the variability of these three gwr outputs which were based on the dependent variables of spi pdsi and z index respectively the pca process was finished in environment for visualizing images idl envi software environment it also should be noted that 1 month spi was used as the dependent variable to produce spi targeted integrated index as an example our framework could also include different time scales of spi to obtain different time scales of giidi station 6 y 1 s p i t a r g e t e d i n t e g r a t e d d r o u g h t i n d e x y 2 p d s i t a r g e t e d i n t e g r a t e d d

severity for giidi station that is based on the classification system for usdm abnormally dry moderate drought severe drought extreme drought and exceptional drought we examined the cumulative frequency distribution of historical giidi station values and then delineated the categories based on the definitions for usdm the evaluation of giidi station includes three stages in the first stage we compared giidi station with pci midi and omdi during the growing season april october using the visual comparison method here the years of 2007 2009 and 2011 were selected as the examples of severe moderate and extreme drought years respectively pearson correlation between remote sensing drought indices and in situ indices was then used in the second stage to assess the performance of the compared remotely sensed drought indices in the third stage nine independent variables were selected in a multivariate regression model to evaluate whether the environmental factors e g lulc climate and soil variables could affect the applicability of giidi station 4 results 4 1 the significance of gwr and pca models fig 2 shows an example of the weighting of pci tci vci and smci when taking pdsi in july 2011 as the response variable using the gwr model in fig 2 different colors of the points indicate different weighting of each remote sensing based drought index according to fig 2 we can see the weighting of pci tci vci and smci was spatially heterogeneous for example in the southern great plains vci took higher weighting than other indices but in the southeast the weighting of vci was lower than other indices unlike the spatial homogeneity models gwr model could provide the criterion weights depend on the spatial variable range of criterion values for clarity in the process of pca composition we referred to the integrated drought index developed using pdsi as the dependent variable in gwr as the pdsi targeted combined drought index cdi similarly spi targeted cdi and z index targeted cdi were named when using spi and z index as the dependent variables respectively fig 3 shows the relationships between giidi station spi targeted cdi pdsi targeted cdi and z index targeted cdi for july 2011 according to fig 3 there were still differences between spi pdsi and z index targeted cdi and giidi station achieved better agreement with in situ drought indices after the three cdis were integrated by pca the determination of coefficients r2 between pdsi targeted cdi and spi z index targeted cdi were 0 318 and 0 259 respectively while the determination of coefficients r2 between giidi station and spi z index targeted cdi were 0 737 and 0 612 respectively fig 3 thus pca can effectively combine different information from each in situ drought index based cdi into a newly integrated drought index 4 2 giidi station drought category definition to qualitatively classify drought severity we evaluated the historical and cumulative frequency of county level giidi station for all the grid cells over the conus from the year 2002 to 2011 fig 4 using drought classification schemes of usdm as a guide we classified giidi station into six levels based on the historical giidi station frequency distributions table 2 shows the range of giidi station for each level we used 3 5 2 5 1 5 0 5 0 5 as the thresholds for different categories the use of these thresholds led to similar cumulative percentiles to usdm specifically the percentile of exceptional drought extreme drought severe drought moderate drought and abnormally dry for giidi station is 1 8 5 6 12 4 23 8 and 33 9 respectively which is similar to usdm 2 for d4 5 for d3 10 for d2 20 for d1 and 30 for d0 4 3 regional drought pattern comparisons the similarity of the remote sensing drought indices to usdm and to each other was assessed by mapping drought conditions over the conus during the growing seasons of 2007 2009 and 2011 as described above these years were selected to exemplify moderate slight and severe drought years respectively maps of monthly drought conditions monitored by the usdm giidi station omdi midi and pci are shown in figs 5 7 these figures demonstrate the diversity of information provided by different drought indicators highlighting the complexity of developing an integrated drought index in various climate regions at the continental scale generally as shown in figs 5 7 giidi station shows greater similarity to usdm under all drought conditions when compared to the other drought indices in 2011 usdm indicated that the majority of texas new mexico and georgia experienced extreme drought d1 beginning in april the drought then began to expand into northern regions e g michigan iowa and illinois and throughout the southeastern by august see usdm in fig 5 all the compared indices indicated a general extreme drought condition from april to may in the south however patterns in pci omdi and midi were similar but not identical to those in the usdm and giidi station they showed expansion of the extreme drought areas into the northern great plains and northwestern conus in june when these regions were identified as drought free by usdm and giidi station fig 6 provides additional insights about the performance of the indices during the moderate drought of 2009 the usdm indicated moderate drought in western regions along the coast and a small region of extreme drought in south texas giidi station generally captured the drought features in the usdm while other drought indices showed different patterns for example from april to may pci omdi and midi diagnosed drought conditions in the northwestern great plains in september these indices classified areas of the western and northeastern conus as experience severe drought severe drought in these areas was not identified by usdm and giidi station in 2009 as shown in fig 7 similar results were obtained for the severe drought year of 2007 based on the usdm data western regions and areas of the southeast georgia alabama north and south carolina experienced d1 moderate drought to d2 severe drought the drought condition became even more severe d2 and d3 in southeastern regions by october 2007 pci midi and omdi maps showed high inter index agreement but were less similar to usdm when compared to giidi station unlike midi pci and omdi giidi station identified drought conditions in the west and southeastern regions that did not change much in terms of severity from april to october 2007 in reasonable agreement with predictions from the usdm 4 4 monthly temporal and spatial correlation comparisons we compared the correlations between seven remotely sensed drought indices giidi station midi omdi pci tci vci and smci and in situ drought indices pdsi z index 1 2 3 6 9 12 and 24 month spi of the remote sensing based indices considered here giidi station was the most similar to the in situ indices in their temporal ranking of drought conditions see tables 3 and 4 fig 8 shows the temporal similarity between the in situ drought indices and each of the remote sensing drought indices evaluated as linear correlation within each climate division giidi station yielded higher performance than the other remote sensing based indices high correlation values r value 0 6 between giidi station and the in situ drought indices were obtained in almost all the climate divisions and across the multiple timescales associated with the in situ indices in the western and northeastern united states most of the remote sensing based drought indices showed weak correlation e g r 0 4 with in situ drought indices for example as shown in fig 8 vci generally correlated significantly only in the southern conus pci exhibited strong correlations with spi 1 but not with long term spi spi 3 and spi 6 in most of the conus 4 5 factors influencing the relationships between giidi station and in situ drought indices nine independent variables lulc mean annual precipitation mean annual temperature permeability mean soil moisture organic material in soil available water holding capacity hydrologic groups and soil drainage class were entered into a stepwise multivariate regression model where the dependent variable was the r values between giidi station and pdsi z index and spi results showed that there was no significant correlation between the nine independent variables and the performance of giidi station p 0 05 the stepwise regression model results showed that if four or five variables were included in the regression model it provided the best regression result fig 9 however the top four or five significant variables all together explained only 8 3 of the giidi station performance fig 9 this indicates that the performance of giidi station for monitoring drought conditions is not dependent on these nine common environmental factors in comparison some previous studies have shown that the performance of other remotely sensed drought indices is strongly dependent on environmental factors brown et al 2008 ji and peters 2003 quiring and ganesh 2010 zhang et al 2017 for example quiring and ganesh 2010 demonstrated that the response of vci to drought conditions is modulated by vegetation type land use practices and soil type 5 discussion based on the comparison results we can draw some general conclusions regarding the applicability of giidi station for drought monitoring across climate divisions the giidi station provides several unique characteristics for drought monitoring the most unique characteristics of giidi station for drought monitoring is its potential as a reliable index for drought monitoring across climate regions linked to the fact that its performance is independent of environmental factors previous work indicated that the performances of traditional remote sensing based indices such as vci depend on precipitation land cover and other factors bayarjargal et al 2006 quiring and ganesh 2010 singh et al 2003 vicente serrano 2007 and therefore have limited applicability across different regions for example for the fifteen remote sensing based drought indices assessed by zhang et al 2017 performance of most remote sensing based drought indices is generally good only in texas and the central conus and is poorer in western and northeastern regions compared with these indices giidi station can perform reasonably well across all different climate regions our results indicate that giidi station has high correlation with in situ evaluation drought indices located in almost all the climate regions in addition the performance of giidi station for drought monitoring is not influenced by the common environmental factors such as lulc mean annual precipitation mean annual temperature permeability mean soil moisture organic material in soil available water holding capacity hydrologic groups and soil drainage class another unique characteristic of giidi station for drought monitoring is that it could monitor different severity of drought conditions we selected 2007 2009 and 2011 as the severe moderate and extreme drought examples in our study and giidi station shows the best match with usdm according to our visual interpretation in addition compared with usdm giidi station does not require knowledge from local experts which makes the establishment of giidi station much less expensive and time consuming than usdm several factors could contribute to the superior performance of giidi station for drought monitoring firstly the gwr model which is used to combine multiple single drought indices and includes the spatial coordinates of the sample sites in the analysis has the potential to provide a more appropriate basis for the spatial integration of the relationship between variables different single indices have different characters and they also have different applicability previous studies indicated that viupd based vci performed worse in regions with lower temperature and smci performed worse in regions with high density of vegetation cover jiao et al 2016 zhang et al 2017 so in relatively cold regions the weighting of vci should be lower than other indices and in the high density vegetation covered regions the weighting of smci should be lower the gwr model is a preferable choice for combining single drought indices because it permits this flexibility in weighting because gwr model is a local regression model for spatially varying relationships it leads to the single indices have their high weights in the regions where they best suitable for as the parameters from gwr model shown in fig 2 high weighting of vci mainly located on warm regions such as texas similarly the relatively higher weighting of smci mainly located on the sparse vegetation covered region in the west our spatial distributions of the weights for the single drought indices are in accordance with the findings of previous studies secondly the selection of multiple dependent variables is another factor that potentially contributes to the good performance of giidi station many previous studies only use one in situ based drought index as the dependent variable to combine multiple dependent variables for example hao et al 2015 used the in situ based spei as the dependent variable to composite tci pci and smci for establishing omdi brown et al 2008 only used pdsi as the dependent variable to combine the multi variable when calculating vegdri such approach reflects a limited perspective on drought as there are differences between the station based drought indices we used three different in situ based drought indices pdsi z index and spi as the dependent variables to composite the integrated drought indices the evaluation of pca output in our results indicates that giidi station could synthetically contain the most information from dependent of variable from pdsi z index and spi the integration of the information from pdsi z index and spi makes giidi station shows better consistency with usdm in different severity of drought conditions since usdm itself contains the combined information from different drought indices such as pdsi z index and spi third the selection of single indices is another factor that potentially contributes to the good performance of giidi station previous studies indicate that the time series analysis based single drought indices pci tci vci and smci performed better than other types of single drought indices such as perpendicular drought index pdi modified perpendicular drought index mpdi and temperature vegetation dryness index tvdi zhang et al 2017 pci is derived from the scaled precipitation information based on trmm data tci is derived from land surface temperature information vci is about the condition of vegetation growth and the smci is soil moisture condition from amsr e data these indices are not fully correlated with each other in this regard pci smci vci and tci were selected to composite giidi station to summarize giidi station can be more confidently applied across different environmental regions when compared to the existing remotely sensed drought indices and it has potential to be used as a mixture of meteorological drought and agricultural drought index however the application of giidi station is limited to regions with available meteorological ground observations establishing reliable integrated remote sensing based drought indices which could be applied in various environmental regions without relying on ground observations is an important avenue for future work e g jiao et al 2019 6 conclusions reliable drought monitoring is fundamental to planning and mitigation of drought impacts given the complexity of drought a drought index from single data source which typically represents a limited perspective on drought impacts may not be sufficient for comprehensive drought detection this study outlines a multi index drought monitoring framework giidi station gwr model and pca were used to integrate multi sensor remote sensing data and in situ based drought indices in this framework the giidi station along with the usdm pci omdi and midi were assessed for their ability to characterize moderate severe and extreme drought examples in the united states their performance was also compared to information provided by in situ drought indices pdsi z index spi 1 spi 3 spi 6 spi 9 spi 12 and spi 24 and the relationship between giidi station and a range of environmental factors was also investigated based on the case studies the giidi station generally captures the drought severity as indicated by usdm the results also indicated that the giidi station had the strongest correlation with in situ drought indices when compared to the other remote sensing based indices in most climate divisions and its applicability is not significantly affected by environmental factors such as precipitation temperature soil available water holding capacity soil moisture soil permeability soil drainage class hydrological group organic material in soil and lulc we emphasize that giidi station is not meant to replace any other drought indices but as an additional source of information and a new framework which combines different perspectives afforded by remote sensing and in situ data and has great potential for monitoring drought conditions

6428,remote sensing data are frequently incorporated into drought indices used widely by research and management communities to assess and diagnose current and historic drought events the integrated drought indices combine multiple indicators and reflect drought conditions from a range of perspectives i e hydrological agricultural meteorological however the success of most remote sensing based drought indices is constrained by geographic regions since their performance strongly depends on environmental factors such as land cover type temperature and soil moisture to address this limitation we propose a framework for a new integrated drought index that performs well across diverse climate regions our framework uses a geographically weighted regression model and principal component analysis to composite a range of vegetation and meteorological indices derived from multiple remote sensing platforms and in situ drought indices developed from meteorological station data our new index which we call the station enabled geographically independent integrated drought index giidi station compared favorably with other common drought indices such as microwave integrated drought index midi optimized meteorological drought index omdi precipitation condition index pci temperature condition index tci soil moisture condition index smci and vegetation condition index vci using pearson correlation analyses between remote sensing and in situ drought indices during the growing season april to october from 2002 to 2011 we show that giidi station had the best correlations with in situ drought indices across the entire study region of the continental united states the performance of giidi station was not affected by common environmental factors such as precipitation temperature land cover and soil conditions taken together our results suggest that giidi station has considerable potential to improve our ability of monitoring drought at regional scales provided

planning and mitigation of drought impacts since the frequency and consequences of droughts are expected to intensify under climate change halwatura et al 2017 keyantash and dracup 2004 wilhelmi and wilhite 2002 zhou et al 2012 historically droughts have been classified and assessed using point observations from networks of meteorological stations for instance the widely used standardized precipitation index spi which is the world meteorological organization s wmo recommended indicator for meteorological drought is based on ground based precipitation observations hayes et al 1999 mckee et al 1993 more recently global and near real time observations of remote sensing technology open the door for comprehensively characterizing drought conditions regionally and globally especially in regions with limited sampling gauges jiao et al 2019 lu et al 2016 rhee et al 2010 wang et al 2012 wu et al 2013 zhang et al 2017 various drought indices building on remote sensing observations have been developed to estimate drought conditions table 1 provides a summary of the commonly used drought indices however many of the existing remote sensing drought indices are linked to a single biophysical variable e g precipitation soil moisture greenness and may not be sufficient to capture the complex processes and diverse impacts of drought aghakouchak et al 2015 hao and singh 2015 there is an urgent need to develop integrated indices which could combine station data and remote sensing observations to alleviate the shortcomings of drought characterization from a single index several studies have focused on developing integrated remote sensing drought indices to provide a more robust and comprehensive estimation of drought for example the microwave integrated drought index midi zhang and jia 2013 scaled drought condition index sdci rhee et al 2010 optimized meteorological drought index omdi and optimized vegetation drought index ovdi hao et al 2015 synthesized drought index sdi du et al 2013 combined variables from multiple perspectives e g soil moisture condition index smci precipitation condition index pci temperature condition index tci and vegetation condition index vci these indices have been shown to perform well in selected study areas du et al 2013 hao et al 2015 rhee et al 2010 zhang and jia 2013 a major challenge for these integrated remote sensing indices is their relatively poor performance when applied to climate regions different from those in which they were developed since they were optimized under a narrow range of environmental conditions another major issue is their inability to adequately represent spatial variability due to their reliance on traditional composition methods park et al 2016 specifically it is often assumed that all areas within a study region contribute the same weight for a particular single index this type of integration is straightforward to implement and is commonly used to develop multivariate drought indices however this type of integration is not well suited for capturing the covariability of drought related indices since it may miss local details that can be significant if the relationship of the related indices is spatially non stationary aghakouchak et al 2015 a third limitation is that traditionally integrated drought indices only use a single in situ based drought index as the dependent variable to combine the multi source remote sensing data for example ovdi uses spi as the dependent variable to determine the weights of pci tci smci and vci hao et al 2015 similarly vegetation drought response index vegdri only uses palmer drought severity index pdsi as the dependent variable to composite multi source data brown et al 2008 however only one dependent variable may not be sufficient to estimate comprehensive drought conditions as they affect hydrological vegetative and meteorological conditions for the regions with both station data and remote sensing images the integration of ground observation information from multiple perspectives and the remote sensing observations from multi sensors could be a better way to comprehensively monitor drought to address these issues the objective of this study is to develop and evaluate a new integrated drought index based on multi sensor remote sensing data for drought monitoring under different climate conditions in this study geographically weighted regression gwr model and principal component analysis pca were used to composite and integrate multiple remote sensing based drought indices gwr and pca were used because they can take the local details into consideration e g using different weights in different parts of the study area for a particular single index thus the newly developed index can be applied to diverse climate regions we also used three in situ based drought indices pdsi moisture anomaly index z index and spi as dependent variables to composite multi source single indices we call the new product the station enabled geographically independent integrated drought index giidi station indicating its universal applicability for diverse climate regions to evaluate the performance of giidi station it was compared with both integrated drought indices midi omdi and single drought indices pci tci vci and smci we also evaluated whether environmental factors impact the performance of giidi station across spatial climate gradients 2 data both in situ and remote sensing datasets were used to develop and assess the performance of our giidi station these data were also used to compare giidi stations s performance with other remote sensing based drought indices in various climate divisions over the continental united states conus focusing on the growing season from 2002 to 2011 the product of advanced microwave scanning radiometer for eos amsr e was used in the development of giidi station and the amsr e data was available from 2002 to 2011 2 1 in situ based drought indices three monthly in situ drought indices pdsi moisture anomaly index z index and standardized precipitation index spi were selected for incorporation into giidi station because they are among the most commonly used indicators for drought monitoring in the united states these in situ drought indices which provide general assessment of soil moisture and precipitation conditions were obtained from the noaa s national climatic data center ncdc noaa repository for 344 climatic divisions in the conus http www1 ncdc noaa gov pub data cirs these selected in situ indices also have been widely applied by various studies to evaluate remote sensing drought indices brown et al 2008 caccamo et al 2011 ji and peters 2003 rhee et al 2010 in our study the pdsi z index and spi from 1012 observation stations were used as training data and climate division level based pdsi z index and spi were used as evaluation data 2 2 remote sensing data four remote based drought indices moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer modis data based vci and tci amsr e based smci and trmm based pci were selected for incorporation into giidi station these four remote sensing based drought indices estimate drought conditions from unique perspectives the vci which is derived from vegetation index based on the universal pattern decomposition method viupd estimates drought conditions based on vegetative response it was calculated using modis land surface data mod09a1 downloaded from the land processes distributed active center lpdaac http lpdaac usgs gov tci describes temperature anomaly during the drought events monthly tci was calculated using modis land surface temperature lst data mod11a2 which was obtained from the national aeronautics and space administration s nasa earth observing system data and information system eosdis http reverb echo nasa gov pci provides information on precipitation deficiency it was calculated based on trmm 3b43 data which was available at the nasa data and information services center disc http mirador gsfc nasa gov smci was selected to describe the soil moisture perspective we compute smci based on the amsr e product obtained from vrije universtiteit amsterdam http nsidc org 2 3 other data united states drought monitor usdm data was chosen as a proxy for evaluating the performance of giidi station usdm combines information from multiple ground observation based drought indicators and local reports from state climatologists and observers throughout the country and it is used as a trigger for federal drought relief programs brown et al 2008 hayes et al 2012 the usdm map has a spatial resolution at the approximate scale of a climate division svoboda et al 2002 the usdm classifies droughts as d0 abnormally dry d1 moderate drought d2 severe drought d3 extreme drought and d4 exceptional drought events detailed information about usdm is available at http drought unl dm in order to further evaluate the performance of giidi station nine additional datasets including land use land cover lulc data climate data and soil data were selected to explore whether the performance of giidi station for drought monitoring depends on common environmental factors the u s geological survey national land cover data nlcd http landcover usgs gov was used to describe lulc state mean annual precipitation and temperature data were selected to describe climate conditions data on estimated mean annual precipitation and temperature in each climate division was obtained from the oregon state university prism group http prism oregonstate edu and disc http mirador gsfc nasa gov respectively information on five soil properties including permeability water table depth available water holding capacity hydrologic groups and soil drainage were obtained from the center for environmental informatics at penn state university http www soilinfo psu edu a more detailed description of these indices is available from quiring and ganesh 2010 3 methodology to develop the composite giidi station index we first calculated vci using viupd instead of the commonly used ndvi since the former has been shown to better estimate drought conditions jiao et al 2016 next we used the gwr model to composite tci vci pci and smci we used three different in situ drought indices spi pdsi and z index as the dependent variables to composite the remote sensing based condition indices tci vci pci and smci there are three outcomes of gwr model based composition spi targeted integrated drought index pdsi targeted integrated drought index and z index targeted integrated drought index the pca method was then used to composite these three outcomes of the gwr into giidi station to validate the product we first evaluated the correlation between in situ drought indices and giidi station in different climate divisions then the lulc data climate data and soil data were used to explore whether the performance of giidi station for drought estimation was affected by lulc precipitation temperature and soil conditions more details about our methodology are given in sections 3 1 3 3 and the overall approach is illustrated in fig 1 3 1 scaled remote sensing indices table 1 shows detailed information about the remote sensing based drought indices used in this study to reiterate tci pci vci and smci were used to develop giidi station while midi and omdi were used to assess its drought monitoring performance the analysis in this study focused primarily on the months from april to october in order to avoid noise from the snow and ice in the winter 3 2 giidi station development and evaluation the development of giidi station incorporated in situ drought indices spi pdsi and z index from 1012 observation stations supplementary material fig 1 shows the locations of the observation stations giidi station was calculated using gwr model based on the following equations 1 y Œ≤ 0 Œº v Œ≤ 1 Œº v tci Œ≤ 2 Œº v vci Œ≤ 3 Œº v pci Œ≤ 4 Œº v smci 2 y spi pdsi z i n d e x where Œº v denotes the geographical coordinates of the 1012 observation stations Œ≤ i Œº v represents the weighting of single indices tci vci pci and smci y is the dependent variable which includes the three widely used in situ drought indices spi pdsi and z index in geographically weighted regression the parameter estimates are made using an approach in which the contribution of a sample to the analysis is weighted based on its spatial proximity to the specific location under consideration data from observations close to the location under consideration are weighted more than data from observations further away the parameters were estimated from 3 Œ≤ Œº v x t w Œº v x 1 x t w Œº v y where Œ≤ Œº v represents an estimate of Œ≤ w Œº v is the weighting matrix which ensures that observations close to the location at which the parameter estimates are to be made have more influence on the analysis than those further away w Œº v is a matrix of weights relative to the position of Œº v in our study area w Œº v is computed from a weighting scheme that is also known as a kernel fotheringham et al 1998 gaussian shaped kernel was used in our study 4 w i u v e 0 5 d i u v h 2 where w i u v is the geographical weight of the ith observation relative to the location u v and u v is the coordinate of observation points d i u v is the distance between the grid cells and the location u v h is known as the bandwidth in our study the bandwidth was determined based on the corrected akaike information criterion aicc hurvich et al 1998 which takes the form below 5 a i c c 2 n l o g e œÉ n l o g e 2 œÄ n n t r s n 2 t r s where n is the number of observations in the dataset œÉ is the estimate of the standard deviation of the residuals and tr s is the trace of the hat matrix the optimum of h could be found based on the least aicc in this study gwr model was established using arcpy module in python given that there were three different in situ based drought indices spi pdsi and z index as the dependent variables in eq 1 there were three outcomes of the gwr model spi targeted integrated drought indices pdsi targeted integrated drought indices and z index targeted integrated drought indices in order to better integrate these three gwr model outputs into one variable the pca method was used to composite the three different outcomes into giidi station see eqs 6 and 7 the basic purpose of using pca is to reduce the dimensionality of a data set from a large set of variables into a small set of variables wold et al 1987 the first principal component pc1 of the pca was selected and the values of the pc1 were normalized as the range of 6 to 6 in corresponding to the range of pdsi then the normalized pc1 was defined as giidi station since it accounts for as much of the variability of these three gwr outputs which were based on the dependent variables of spi pdsi and z index respectively the pca process was finished in environment for visualizing images idl envi software environment it also should be noted that 1 month spi was used as the dependent variable to produce spi targeted integrated index as an example our framework could also include different time scales of spi to obtain different time scales of giidi station 6 y 1 s p i t a r g e t e d i n t e g r a t e d d r o u g h t i n d e x y 2 p d s i t a r g e t e d i n t e g r a t e d d

severity for giidi station that is based on the classification system for usdm abnormally dry moderate drought severe drought extreme drought and exceptional drought we examined the cumulative frequency distribution of historical giidi station values and then delineated the categories based on the definitions for usdm the evaluation of giidi station includes three stages in the first stage we compared giidi station with pci midi and omdi during the growing season april october using the visual comparison method here the years of 2007 2009 and 2011 were selected as the examples of severe moderate and extreme drought years respectively pearson correlation between remote sensing drought indices and in situ indices was then used in the second stage to assess the performance of the compared remotely sensed drought indices in the third stage nine independent variables were selected in a multivariate regression model to evaluate whether the environmental factors e g lulc climate and soil variables could affect the applicability of giidi station 4 results 4 1 the significance of gwr and pca models fig 2 shows an example of the weighting of pci tci vci and smci when taking pdsi in july 2011 as the response variable using the gwr model in fig 2 different colors of the points indicate different weighting of each remote sensing based drought index according to fig 2 we can see the weighting of pci tci vci and smci was spatially heterogeneous for example in the southern great plains vci took higher weighting than other indices but in the southeast the weighting of vci was lower than other indices unlike the spatial homogeneity models gwr model could provide the criterion weights depend on the spatial variable range of criterion values for clarity in the process of pca composition we referred to the integrated drought index developed using pdsi as the dependent variable in gwr as the pdsi targeted combined drought index cdi similarly spi targeted cdi and z index targeted cdi were named when using spi and z index as the dependent variables respectively fig 3 shows the relationships between giidi station spi targeted cdi pdsi targeted cdi and z index targeted cdi for july 2011 according to fig 3 there were still differences between spi pdsi and z index targeted cdi and giidi station achieved better agreement with in situ drought indices after the three cdis were integrated by pca the determination of coefficients r2 between pdsi targeted cdi and spi z index targeted cdi were 0 318 and 0 259 respectively while the determination of coefficients r2 between giidi station and spi z index targeted cdi were 0 737 and 0 612 respectively fig 3 thus pca can effectively combine different information from each in situ drought index based cdi into a newly integrated drought index 4 2 giidi station drought category definition to qualitatively classify drought severity we evaluated the historical and cumulative frequency of county level giidi station for all the grid cells over the conus from the year 2002 to 2011 fig 4 using drought classification schemes of usdm as a guide we classified giidi station into six levels based on the historical giidi station frequency distributions table 2 shows the range of giidi station for each level we used 3 5 2 5 1 5 0 5 0 5 as the thresholds for different categories the use of these thresholds led to similar cumulative percentiles to usdm specifically the percentile of exceptional drought extreme drought severe drought moderate drought and abnormally dry for giidi station is 1 8 5 6 12 4 23 8 and 33 9 respectively which is similar to usdm 2 for d4 5 for d3 10 for d2 20 for d1 and 30 for d0 4 3 regional drought pattern comparisons the similarity of the remote sensing drought indices to usdm and to each other was assessed by mapping drought conditions over the conus during the growing seasons of 2007 2009 and 2011 as described above these years were selected to exemplify moderate slight and severe drought years respectively maps of monthly drought conditions monitored by the usdm giidi station omdi midi and pci are shown in figs 5 7 these figures demonstrate the diversity of information provided by different drought indicators highlighting the complexity of developing an integrated drought index in various climate regions at the continental scale generally as shown in figs 5 7 giidi station shows greater similarity to usdm under all drought conditions when compared to the other drought indices in 2011 usdm indicated that the majority of texas new mexico and georgia experienced extreme drought d1 beginning in april the drought then began to expand into northern regions e g michigan iowa and illinois and throughout the southeastern by august see usdm in fig 5 all the compared indices indicated a general extreme drought condition from april to may in the south however patterns in pci omdi and midi were similar but not identical to those in the usdm and giidi station they showed expansion of the extreme drought areas into the northern great plains and northwestern conus in june when these regions were identified as drought free by usdm and giidi station fig 6 provides additional insights about the performance of the indices during the moderate drought of 2009 the usdm indicated moderate drought in western regions along the coast and a small region of extreme drought in south texas giidi station generally captured the drought features in the usdm while other drought indices showed different patterns for example from april to may pci omdi and midi diagnosed drought conditions in the northwestern great plains in september these indices classified areas of the western and northeastern conus as experience severe drought severe drought in these areas was not identified by usdm and giidi station in 2009 as shown in fig 7 similar results were obtained for the severe drought year of 2007 based on the usdm data western regions and areas of the southeast georgia alabama north and south carolina experienced d1 moderate drought to d2 severe drought the drought condition became even more severe d2 and d3 in southeastern regions by october 2007 pci midi and omdi maps showed high inter index agreement but were less similar to usdm when compared to giidi station unlike midi pci and omdi giidi station identified drought conditions in the west and southeastern regions that did not change much in terms of severity from april to october 2007 in reasonable agreement with predictions from the usdm 4 4 monthly temporal and spatial correlation comparisons we compared the correlations between seven remotely sensed drought indices giidi station midi omdi pci tci vci and smci and in situ drought indices pdsi z index 1 2 3 6 9 12 and 24 month spi of the remote sensing based indices considered here giidi station was the most similar to the in situ indices in their temporal ranking of drought conditions see tables 3 and 4 fig 8 shows the temporal similarity between the in situ drought indices and each of the remote sensing drought indices evaluated as linear correlation within each climate division giidi station yielded higher performance than the other remote sensing based indices high correlation values r value 0 6 between giidi station and the in situ drought indices were obtained in almost all the climate divisions and across the multiple timescales associated with the in situ indices in the western and northeastern united states most of the remote sensing based drought indices showed weak correlation e g r 0 4 with in situ drought indices for example as shown in fig 8 vci generally correlated significantly only in the southern conus pci exhibited strong correlations with spi 1 but not with long term spi spi 3 and spi 6 in most of the conus 4 5 factors influencing the relationships between giidi station and in situ drought indices nine independent variables lulc mean annual precipitation mean annual temperature permeability mean soil moisture organic material in soil available water holding capacity hydrologic groups and soil drainage class were entered into a stepwise multivariate regression model where the dependent variable was the r values between giidi station and pdsi z index and spi results showed that there was no significant correlation between the nine independent variables and the performance of giidi station p 0 05 the stepwise regression model results showed that if four or five variables were included in the regression model it provided the best regression result fig 9 however the top four or five significant variables all together explained only 8 3 of the giidi station performance fig 9 this indicates that the performance of giidi station for monitoring drought conditions is not dependent on these nine common environmental factors in comparison some previous studies have shown that the performance of other remotely sensed drought indices is strongly dependent on environmental factors brown et al 2008 ji and peters 2003 quiring and ganesh 2010 zhang et al 2017 for example quiring and ganesh 2010 demonstrated that the response of vci to drought conditions is modulated by vegetation type land use practices and soil type 5 discussion based on the comparison results we can draw some general conclusions regarding the applicability of giidi station for drought monitoring across climate divisions the giidi station provides several unique characteristics for drought monitoring the most unique characteristics of giidi station for drought monitoring is its potential as a reliable index for drought monitoring across climate regions linked to the fact that its performance is independent of environmental factors previous work indicated that the performances of traditional remote sensing based indices such as vci depend on precipitation land cover and other factors bayarjargal et al 2006 quiring and ganesh 2010 singh et al 2003 vicente serrano 2007 and therefore have limited applicability across different regions for example for the fifteen remote sensing based drought indices assessed by zhang et al 2017 performance of most remote sensing based drought indices is generally good only in texas and the central conus and is poorer in western and northeastern regions compared with these indices giidi station can perform reasonably well across all different climate regions our results indicate that giidi station has high correlation with in situ evaluation drought indices located in almost all the climate regions in addition the performance of giidi station for drought monitoring is not influenced by the common environmental factors such as lulc mean annual precipitation mean annual temperature permeability mean soil moisture organic material in soil available water holding capacity hydrologic groups and soil drainage class another unique characteristic of giidi station for drought monitoring is that it could monitor different severity of drought conditions we selected 2007 2009 and 2011 as the severe moderate and extreme drought examples in our study and giidi station shows the best match with usdm according to our visual interpretation in addition compared with usdm giidi station does not require knowledge from local experts which makes the establishment of giidi station much less expensive and time consuming than usdm several factors could contribute to the superior performance of giidi station for drought monitoring firstly the gwr model which is used to combine multiple single drought indices and includes the spatial coordinates of the sample sites in the analysis has the potential to provide a more appropriate basis for the spatial integration of the relationship between variables different single indices have different characters and they also have different applicability previous studies indicated that viupd based vci performed worse in regions with lower temperature and smci performed worse in regions with high density of vegetation cover jiao et al 2016 zhang et al 2017 so in relatively cold regions the weighting of vci should be lower than other indices and in the high density vegetation covered regions the weighting of smci should be lower the gwr model is a preferable choice for combining single drought indices because it permits this flexibility in weighting because gwr model is a local regression model for spatially varying relationships it leads to the single indices have their high weights in the regions where they best suitable for as the parameters from gwr model shown in fig 2 high weighting of vci mainly located on warm regions such as texas similarly the relatively higher weighting of smci mainly located on the sparse vegetation covered region in the west our spatial distributions of the weights for the single drought indices are in accordance with the findings of previous studies secondly the selection of multiple dependent variables is another factor that potentially contributes to the good performance of giidi station many previous studies only use one in situ based drought index as the dependent variable to combine multiple dependent variables for example hao et al 2015 used the in situ based spei as the dependent variable to composite tci pci and smci for establishing omdi brown et al 2008 only used pdsi as the dependent variable to combine the multi variable when calculating vegdri such approach reflects a limited perspective on drought as there are differences between the station based drought indices we used three different in situ based drought indices pdsi z index and spi as the dependent variables to composite the integrated drought indices the evaluation of pca output in our results indicates that giidi station could synthetically contain the most information from dependent of variable from pdsi z index and spi the integration of the information from pdsi z index and spi makes giidi station shows better consistency with usdm in different severity of drought conditions since usdm itself contains the combined information from different drought indices such as pdsi z index and spi third the selection of single indices is another factor that potentially contributes to the good performance of giidi station previous studies indicate that the time series analysis based single drought indices pci tci vci and smci performed better than other types of single drought indices such as perpendicular drought index pdi modified perpendicular drought index mpdi and temperature vegetation dryness index tvdi zhang et al 2017 pci is derived from the scaled precipitation information based on trmm data tci is derived from land surface temperature information vci is about the condition of vegetation growth and the smci is soil moisture condition from amsr e data these indices are not fully correlated with each other in this regard pci smci vci and tci were selected to composite giidi station to summarize giidi station can be more confidently applied across different environmental regions when compared to the existing remotely sensed drought indices and it has potential to be used as a mixture of meteorological drought and agricultural drought index however the application of giidi station is limited to regions with available meteorological ground observations establishing reliable integrated remote sensing based drought indices which could be applied in various environmental regions without relying on ground observations is an important avenue for future work e g jiao et al 2019 6 conclusions reliable drought monitoring is fundamental to planning and mitigation of drought impacts given the complexity of drought a drought index from single data source which typically represents a limited perspective on drought impacts may not be sufficient for comprehensive drought detection this study outlines a multi index drought monitoring framework giidi station gwr model and pca were used to integrate multi sensor remote sensing data and in situ based drought indices in this framework the giidi station along with the usdm pci omdi and midi were assessed for their ability to characterize moderate severe and extreme drought examples in the united states their performance was also compared to information provided by in situ drought indices pdsi z index spi 1 spi 3 spi 6 spi 9 spi 12 and spi 24 and the relationship between giidi station and a range of environmental factors was also investigated based on the case studies the giidi station generally captures the drought severity as indicated by usdm the results also indicated that the giidi station had the strongest correlation with in situ drought indices when compared to the other remote sensing based indices in most climate divisions and its applicability is not significantly affected by environmental factors such as precipitation temperature soil available water holding capacity soil moisture soil permeability soil drainage class hydrological group organic material in soil and lulc we emphasize that giidi station is not meant to replace any other drought indices but as an additional source of information and a new framework which combines different perspectives afforded by remote sensing and in situ data and has great potential for monitoring drought conditions

6429,many semi arid regions of the world experience rainfall patterns characterized by high spatial variability accurate spatial representation of different types of rainfall will facilitate the application of distributed hydrological models in these areas this study presents a daily spatially distributed stochastic rainfall generator based on a first order markov chain model calibrated using 50 years of rainfall observations at 88 gages from 1967 through 2016 in the 148 km2 walnut gulch experimental watershed three types of rainfall including convective frontal and tropical depression storms were simulated separately in the generator using biweekly parameterization convective storms were simulated based on an elliptical shape rain cell conceptual model whereas frontal and tropical depression storms were simulated as uniform rainfall fields over the whole watershed with introduced random variability the rainfall generator was evaluated by comparing the mean statistics of 30 sets of 50 year simulated data versus the 50 year rain gage observed data most individual storm statistics and aggregated seasonal rainfall statistics were similar to the measured rainfall observations the long term mean values of both summer and winter rainfall amount were statistically satisfactory this model can serve as a guide for application in areas with convective frontal and tropical depression storms keywords rainfall generator spatial semi arid convective storm markov chain 1 introduction precipitation is a driving force of many hydrologic processes especially for regions with semi arid and arid climates however the lack of reliable rainfall records limits the development of hydrologic research and applications stochastic rainfall generators can simulate the key characteristics of natural rainfall records wilks and wilby 1999 the advantage of simulated rainfall data is that they can provide long series of statistically representative records which can be used in hydrological models agricultural models or climate change impact assessment to produce mathematically stable statistical representations of hydrologic response for a given weather record as models become more sophisticated the requirements for higher resolution and continuous rainfall series data become more important bonta 2004 breinl et al 2017 li et al 2017 serinaldi 2009 rainfall has both temporal and spatial characteristics that need to be accounted for in the generation process point based rainfall generators which focus on the temporal dimension of rainfall are the most commonly used models arnold and williams 1989 calenda and napolitano 1999 kavvas and delleur 1981 papalexiou et al 2011 richardson 1981 valdes et al 1985 these generators are based on single site observations and therefore not designed to provide spatial resolution researchers have studied the effect of spatially variable rainfall on hydrologic response some studies argued that the spatial variability of rainfall does not cause significant differences in runoff generation or only causes secondary effects beven and hornberger 1982 obled et al 1994 schuurmans and bierkens 2006 these catchment sizes ranged from 71 to 287 km2 which were mostly medium sized rural catchments obled et al 1994 noted that their conclusions may not apply for smaller urbanized or larger rural areas schuurmans and bierkens 2006 found that the spatial variability has a major effect on daily simulation of discharge groundwater level and soil moisture while for general longer term behavior of the hydrological system the areal average rainfall information is adequate koren et al 1999 noted that heterogeneity of rainfall is a major factor for small scale catchments but the fraction of the watershed covered by rainfall is not as important since rainfall is likely to cover the whole area however for larger scales the fractional area of the watershed covered by rainfall is a major factor for runoff generation specific site conditions in terms of either climate characteristics or size of the watershed can lead to quite different conclusions on how spatial rainfall affects hydrological responses in a semi arid region such as is found in much of the southwestern united states where runoff is dominated by summer convective storms transmission losses in ephemeral channels are a significant factor in the water budget goodrich et al 1997 renard et al 1993 thus the spatial distribution of rainfall may matter more in these environments creating distinctive runoff response for upper and lower streams bell and moore 2000 also pointed out that convective rainfall induces more sensitivity in runoff production than does stratiform rainfall to facilitate the accurate modeling of hydrologic response in semi arid regions such as in southeastern arizona a rainfall generator that can simulate non uniform rainfall fields in space is needed it will enhance the ability to apply distributed watershed hydrologic models spatial rainfall generators may use multi site data for a specific region so they can also be referred to as multi site rainfall generators compared with point based generators multi site rainfall generators take spatial correlation between stations into consideration since rainfall stations near enough are not totally independent of each other storms organize into groups and form linear bands or spiral bands under different weather systems in nature shuttleworth 2012 in recent years there has been extensive research conducted on different types of multi site rainfall generator models asong et al 2016 bardossy and plate 1992 breinl et al 2017 evin et al 2018 ferraris et al 2003 leander and buishand 2009 li 2014 mehrotra et al 2006 peleg and morin 2014 serinaldi 2009 wilks 1999 most rainfall generators deal with two major components rainfall occurrence and rainfall amount there are two basic approaches for precipitation occurrence generation one is the richardson type richardson 1981 and the other is serial type racsko et al 1991 the richardson type generator is based on markov chain models which simulates day to day rainfall occurrence using transition probabilities serial type generators account for long term wet or dry trends usually beginning with the simulation of dry and wet series of years and then simulate rainfall amount based on dry and wet conditions there are also basically two types of methods for representing spatial distribution of rainfall amounts the first type focuses on the physical structure of small scale rain cells such as shape and size either using rain gage data cowpertwait et al 1996 ferraris et al 2003 hsieh 2002 von hardenberg et al 2003 or radar images to acquire the parameters morin et al 2006 peleg and morin 2014 2012 the other type considers relatively larger scale rainfall fields usually incorporating mathematical representation of the spatial correlation further classification of this type can include several different methods 1 statistical multi site models usually achieved by fitting empirical distributions for rainfall properties and adding spatial correlation matrix to represent inter sites relation brissette et al 2007 khalili et al 2009 mehrotra and sharma 2007 serinaldi 2009 wilks 1998 2 resampling bootstrap models where rainfall depths were resampled from historical data buishand and brandsma 2001 leander and buishand 2009 recent improvements of resampling methods included adding a reshuffle process to maintain the spatial properties breinl et al 2013 2015 3 nonlinearly filtered autoregressive processes lanza 2000 mej√≠a and rodr√≠guez iturbe 1974 rebora et al 2006 4 generalized linear models asong et al 2016 verdin et al 2018 2015 5 fractal cascade models gupta and waymire 1993 of all the above approaches rain cell models are particularly appropriate to simulate convective storms since these storms share common features of short duration and limited spatial extent osborn et al 1979 generalized linear models have failed to capture the summer convective precipitation characteristics verdin et al 2015 rain cells can either be simulated using circular morin et al 2005 morin and gabella 2007 peleg and morin 2014 or elliptical shapes barnolas et al 2010 peleg and morin 2012 syed et al 2003 the circular shape is easier for modeling since it only has one radius parameter and the intensity distribution can be simplified as well because the cell is isotropic the elliptical shape is more complex since it has both a major and minor axis which also requires an additional orientation parameter it is also necessary to define the center coordinates of the cell and the coverage area for both kinds of cells in addition to cell shape parameters researchers also have studied the representation of rainfall intensity within the cell 1 rain cells with a constant intensity everywhere 2 gaussian decay of intensity from cell center 3 exponential decay of intensity from cell center 4 hybrid of gaussian and exponential decay from cell center the use of constant intensity makes the model simpler but not generally realistic especially when the research focus is on sub daily rain cell development f√©ral et al 2003 noted that the gaussian distribution leads to a faster decay of rainfall intensity from the center outwards but to a lower gradient for the outer part the specific function might differ from region to region which needs further calibration based on actual data in this study we will employ a markov chain based rain cell model to simulate daily spatial rainfall in a semi arid watershed located in southeastern arizona the major objectives are 1 present a conceptual model to characterize the spatial variation of the summer convective rainfall 2 build a stochastic daily rainfall generator capable of simulating three types of rainfall with high spatial resolution that can be used in small to medium sized watersheds and 3 evaluate the performance of the rainfall generator since temporal scale is not the primary consideration in this study we used a daily step in this rainfall generator the richardson type of generator was used for daily rainfall occurrence the geographic area we are concerned about is dominated by convective rainfall during the summer which is suitably represented by a rain cell based generator we combined simulations of individual rain cells to acquire the rainfall field over the entire watershed 2 methods 2 1 study area and data the study area is the walnut gulch experimental watershed located in southeast arizona surrounding the town of tombstone it is a sub watershed of the san pedro river basin the usda ars southwest research center has been operating the watershed since the 1950s with intensive instrumentation and measurement of precipitation the drainage area of walnut gulch is approximately 148 km2 and elevation ranging from 1220 m to 1900 m above sea level the average annual precipitation in this semi arid watershed is approximately 312 mm goodrich et al 2008a following a bimodal pattern with most precipitation occurring in summer and winter seasons osborn 1983 summer rainfall during the months of july august and september accounts for approximately 60 of the total annual amount in this region and results from the north american monsoon nichols et al 2002 stillman et al 2013 the summer rain often forms as convective storms with relatively short duration but high intensity and cover a limited spatial extent the spatial variation of summer convective storms is large the winter frontal storms are however usually of long duration but low intensity and usually cover the whole watershed more uniformly goodrich et al 2008b nearing et al 2015 nichols et al 2002 stillman et al 2013 frontal storms during the non summer months account for approximately 35 of the annual precipitation occasionally snow occurs in winter at the watershed but it melts quickly and does not accumulate the remaining 5 of the annual rainfall falls in the form of tropical depression storms usually dropping large amounts of water much of which will be converted into runoff gochis et al 2006 osborn 1982 walnut gulch experiment watershed has more than sixty years of rainfall monitoring the earliest rainfall record dates back to 1954 the current rain gage network consists of 88 digital rain gages fig 1 which gives an average of approximately 0 6 gage km 2 over the watershed the dense network provides advantages for spatial rainfall analysis especially for the summer convective rainfall events with high spatial variation the full current network of 88 gages was installed by 1967 so this study uses rainfall data from 1967 through 2016 50 years to build the generator from 1967 through 1999 the rainfall data was recorded by analog rain gages while after 2000 digital gages were used goodrich et al 2008a due to resource considerations only nine gages operated out of the monsoon season during the winter months from 1981 through 1991 and in 1999 the reason for this is that winter rainfall in this area is much less spatially variable and the high density of rain gages were not considered necessary goodrich et al 2008a all rainfall data used can be acquired on the website of usda ars swrc the rainfall records are stored in an access database including both daily rainfall and event rainfall the daily data recorded the year month day and total depth received by a certain gage on that day the event data recorded the event id year month day start time duration and depth by a certain gage each day may have multiple events in the database for a gage the resolution for depth is 0 254 mm 0 01 in and the resolution for duration is 1 min 2 2 storm identification a continuous rainfall record consists of both wet periods and dry periods researchers have explored different methods to distinguish events usually based on a threshold of the dry period this threshold can be a fixed time interval for all months such as 6 h used in erosive rainfall studies wischmeier and smith 1978 it can also vary with months depending on the actual distribution of the inter arrival time of rainfall in each month the walnut gulch rainfall database has identified events for each gage separately and assigned an event id to each one the criteria used for each gage in the database was based on a one hour hiatus goodrich et al 2008a however this separation is only for one rain gage which means if two gages received rainfall at the same time they are still assigned different event ids in the database an actual storm occurring in the watershed usually involves more than one gage so it is necessary to identify the individual storms within the entire gage network according to visual perusal of daily rainfall interpolation maps fig s1 in supplemental material we determined that a reasonable storm cell number within one day was no more than five longer thresholds give fewer storms identified for each day since more gage events will be combined the 4 hour threshold to separate and identify storms was selected so that the daily storm numbers were equal to or fewer than five when the event starting times of two gages were within that threshold they are identified to be the same storm in the watershed the maximum depth for each storm was also recorded during the storm identification process 2 3 rainfall occurrence the rainfall generator is built with a richardson type framework using a first order markov chain model richardson 1981 a flow diagram of the computational processes of rainfall generator was shown in fig 2 the basic concept of the first order markov chain method is that the present state of the system only depends on the previous state which translated into the rainfall generation process means that the wet or dry state of the current day depends only on the state of the previous day using the markov approach a wet day is designated if at least one rain gage in the watershed receives rainfall on that day once a wet day is generated for the watershed the model then generates the storm location and coverage which determines how much simulated rainfall each particular gage receives in order to generate a sequence of wet and dry days three transition probabilities need to be calculated p w is the probability of a wet day p w w is the probability of a wet day following a wet day and p w d is the probability of a wet day following a dry day previous research in walnut gulch showed that the transition probabilities for biweekly periods have significant differences from each other hsieh 2002 so all transition probabilities were calculated on a biweekly basis modeling of the wet and dry sequence in the rainfall generator is done by first initializing a random number and then using p w to decide the state of first day after the state of the previous day was decided then the transition probabilities p w w and p w d were used to calculate the state of the next day in each biweekly period for the entire simulation sequence fig 2 when a wet day is generated the type of rainfall also needs to be decided for that day the consensus of most studies on walnut gulch is to separate each year into summer months july september and non summer months goodrich et al 2008a nearing et al 2015 nichols et al 2002 osborn et al 1979 in terms of differentiating rainfall types the dominant type for summer months is convective rainfall while the dominant type for non summer months is frontal rainfall the third type tropical depression rainfall occurs primarily in late summer and fall from september through november gochis et al 2006 probabilities for these three types of rainfall were calculated for each biweekly period using the daily rainfall periods with only one type of rainfall occurrence is straightforward i e the probability of a rainfall to be a frontal type in december and january through june is 1 similarly the probability for convective rainfall in july through august is also 1 the complicated period is from september through november where the probability for tropical depression storms needs to be considered to do this the histogram of all maximum depths of the storms in september through november were plotted and then an exponential distribution was fitted to that histogram the storms with large maximum depth on the histogram tails which could not be fitted well by the exponential curve were identified as tropical depression storms thus their probabilities were calculated using the number of these storms divided by the total number of storms all biweekly periods in september through november share the same probability of tropical depression rainfall and the remainder of the probability for convective and frontal storms in these three months are obtained by subtracting those from 1 thus each day of rainfall as determined by the transition probabilities were categorized as one of the three rainfall types 2 4 rainfall amount and distribution 2 4 1 convective storms convective storms usually show with an approximately elliptical shape in space as determined either from interpolated daily rainfall maps or radar images hsieh 2002 karklinsky and morin 2006 peleg and morin 2012 hsieh 2002 analyzed convective storms in walnut gulch and proposed a conceptual model to characterize them fig 3 this current study followed a similar conceptual model and determined several parameters using rainfall data from july through september collected in 1967 through 2016 the previous study of hsieh 2002 showed that the storm centers are distributed randomly in the watershed sometimes a storm falls only partly within the watershed boundary which means the generated storm center can also be outside the boundary to address this the generator uses a slightly larger area of 26 5 km by 12 5 km divided it into 33 125 cells with each cell representing a 100 m by 100 m area and assigned an index from 1 through 33125 the equation to obtain a storm center location z is 1 z z 33125 where z is the center index ranging from 1 through 33125 and z is the standard uniform deviate ranging from 0 to 1 once the storm center is located a storm center depth is generated from a lognormal distribution and assigned to this storm several distributions were tested for the convective storm maximum depth and the lognormal fit best for the data it is assumed that the depth at the storm center is the maximum and decays to zero on the storm edge a modified linear spread function was applied in the generator fig 4 which maintains constant intensity amount around the center and then follows a linear decay function to the edge 2 depth max d e p 0 r c d max d e p 1 r d 1 c c d r d where depth is the rainfall depth at a certain point inside the storm extent max dep is the maximum depth at storm center d is the distance from the center to the edge passing through at a certain point r is the distance from the center to that point c is a constant between 0 and 1 the calibration of c was made by matching the simulated total summer rainfall amount to the observed rainfall the storm area is related to the maximum depth of the storm after logarithmic transformation a linear regression was built between the area and the maximum depth 3 ln a r e a a 0 a 1 ln max d e p Œµ where the units for storm area is km2 and the units for maximum depth is mm a0 and a1 are the coefficients of the linear regression equation Œµ is a random error term an elliptical shaped storm has two axes the major axis a and the minor axis b the ratio c between them is defined as c a b the value of c follows a normal distribution distribution parameters were acquired from hsieh 2002 the simulated ratio was bounded between one standard deviation around the mean when both the area and the ratio has been chosen for a storm the length of major and minor axis can be calculated from the area equation of an ellipse the last parameter for a convective storm is the orientation it is defined as the counter clockwise angle starting from the east the orientation for a storm is between 0 and 180 degrees and follows a normal distribution distribution parameters were acquired from hsieh 2002 the simulated orientation was bounded between one standard deviation around the mean and extreme values beyond the 0 to 180 degrees range were discarded until a new value within the range was generated 2 4 2 frontal storms the frontal storms in non summer months have much less spatial variation than do the convective storms osborn et al 1979 analyzed data from walnut gulch in non monsoon months suggesting that nine gages are adequate to represent the variability of frontal storms rainfall interpolation maps in non monsoon months also showed this pattern since frontal storms usually cover the whole walnut gulch for simplicity it is assumed that every frontal storm covers the entire watershed in the generation process the total volume of water of each frontal storm is an important factor for quantifying annual water balance but from a hydrologic standpoint winter frontal storms do not generate runoff in the channels at walnut gulch goodrich et al 2008a b nearing et al 2015 the 88 rain gages are nearly uniformly distributed in the watershed which means the area represented by each gage is approximately the same the total volume of water that a storm delivers can be calculated by the following equation 4 vol d e p avg u n i t a r e a n where vol is the total volume of each frontal storm depavg is the average depth of all gages receiving rainfall unit area is the area of one gage represented n is the number of gages receiving rainfall notice that the unit area is not a constant value throughout all the years because with the deletion or addition of gages over time the number of gages in the full network changed during the recording period different unit area values needed to be calculated for different years data from 1967 through 1980 1992 through 1998 and 2000 through 2016 were used to fit a distribution for the total volume of water per storm for each biweekly period the extremely large values on the tails during september through november fit poorly with the overall distribution curve fig s2 which indicates that they follow a different underlying mechanism those storms were considered as tropical depression storms and were excluded from the dataset when building the distribution for frontal storms the model simulation will randomly pick a storm volume from the distribution curve of each biweekly period first spread it evenly in the whole watershed with each grid having the average depth calculated based on the volume and then added some randomness for each grid the random difference added to each grid is based on the standard deviations of the observed rainfall fields and each standard deviation is corresponded to a certain average storm depth in order to provide a reasonable variation of the generated rainfall fields the added randomness is allowed to fluctuate between negative to positive two standard deviations 2 4 3 tropical depression storms the algorithm to generate tropical depression storms is similar to that of frontal storms the difference is that these storms are much less frequent and the volume of water dropped by this type is much larger than by frontal storms gochis et al 2006 osborn 1982 in the previous steps the extreme values of storm volumes in september through november were excluded and all these values were fit to a separate distribution which was used for the tropical depression storms unlike the frontal storms numbers of identified tropical depression storms were limited so only one distribution was fit for the entire september through november period the model simulation will randomly pick a storm volume from the distribution first spread it evenly in the whole watershed and then add some randomness to each grid the random difference added to each grid is based on the standard deviations of the observed rainfall fields and each standard deviation is corresponded to a certain average storm depth in order to provide a reasonable variation of the generated rainfall fields the added randomness is allowed to fluctuate between negative to positive two standard deviations 2 5 multiple events in a day the results in the hsieh 2002 model underestimated the total summer rainfall of each gage partly because the model only simulated one storm per day studies from radar analysis have shown that convective rainfall generally consists of several rain cells in one day morin et al 2004 peleg and morin 2014 2012 thus the ability to simulate multiple events per day were enabled in this rainfall generator both convective storms and frontal storms can have multiple events per day whereas the tropical depression storm remained as single event per day because of their sizes and durations based on the storm identification process in previous section probabilities for different numbers of storms occurring in a single day may be calculated for example the probability of two events per day is made by counting the number of days with two storms and then dividing it by the number of total rainy days in a biweekly period convective rainfall would allow up to five storms per day while frontal rainfall would allow up to three storms per day in this rainfall generator calibration of multiple events probabilities is based on controlling the total number of storms over the fifty year period for instance if the total number of storms is overestimated then the probability of more than one event was adjusted lower by multiplying a coefficient between 0 and 1 consequently probabilities for one event will be adjusted higher to maintain that the sum of all probabilities adding to one 2 6 statistics statistical analyses were performed using matlab the regression equation between convective storm area and maximum depth was based on 4152 convective storms identified in 50 years with maximum depth ranging from 0 25 mm to 95 12 mm and storm area ranging from 1 59 km2 to 152 94 km2 statistical distribution types were determined for convective storm maximum depths and frontal storm and tropical depression storm volumes by comparing the empirical probability distributions to several theoretical distribution functions such as lognormal gamma and exponential the kolmogorov smirnov test k s test was used to test the similarity of the empirical distribution to the theoretical ones using a significance level of Œ± 0 05 if more than one theoretical distribution passed the k s test then the one with least number of parameters was selected in further modelling processing after the selection of distribution type distribution parameters were fit for each type of rainfall as described previously 2 7 model evaluation the rainfall generator was run for 30 sets of 50 year simulation in total 1500 years to obtain a sequence of simulated daily rainfall and then compared with the observed 50 years historical rainfall data model performance was evaluated in two aspects individual storm statistics and seasonally aggregated rainfall statistics previous research goodrich et al 2008a nearing et al 2015 nichols et al 2002 divided the year into summer months july september and non summer months october december january june which is adopted in this study as well the convective storm type was evaluated to determine whether the proposed conceptual model was able to capture the major storm characteristics seasonally aggregated rainfall amounts were evaluated based on the simulation results of six gages gage id 13 34 44 46 62 80 these gages were relatively evenly distributed inside the watershed and were selected as a sample to calculate the seasonal rainfall statistics of both simulated individual storms and aggregated rainfall including the mean standard deviation maximum minimum range and skewness were computed and compared with the 50 year observed data in addition simulated and observed cumulative distribution functions cdfs were created for both individual storms and aggregated rainfall k s tests were performed between simulated and observed cdfs to determine whether they belonged to the same statistical distribution time series properties were evaluated through dry and wet spell lengths of simulated and observed rainfall data the cumulative distribution function curves of both dry and wet spells were created for summer non summer and annual periods seasonal and annual median lengths of dry and wet spells were also calculated for comparison k s tests were performed between simulated and observed cdfs to determine whether they belonged to the same statistical distributions 3 results and discussion 3 1 rainfall characterization the transition probabilities for rainfall occurrence somewhere on the watershed for the 24 half month periods are shown in table 1 the probability of wet p w clearly showed that rainfall frequency reaches its peak in summer exceeding 0 5 from the first half of july to the first half of september the second wettest period is in winter from december through february where p w ranges from 0 2 to 0 3 p w w is always greater than p w d which means that wet days tend to be clustered together axis ratio and orientation statistics were acquired from hsieh 2002 those parameters were measured directly from interpolated rainfall surfaces and shown in table 2 the mean value of axis ratio was 1 54 which is slightly greater than that found in previous work on walnut gulch which showed a major to minor axis ratio of between 1 0 and 1 5 fogel and duckstein 1969 the mean value of orientation found in hsieh 2002 was 91 40 which points generally north as defined in the previous section the area statistics acquired in this study showed a mean of 58 01 km2 which is approximately one third of the watershed area the regression equation of area and maximum depth see eq 3 was determined as 5 ln a r e a 2 1784 0 6851 ln max d e p Œµ r 2 0 57 n 4152 hsieh 2002 using data also from walnut gulch developed a similar regression equation eq 6 between area and maximum depth from 48 interpolated storm surfaces with the maximum depth ranging from 4 83 mm to 47 75 mm and storm areas ranging from 3 6 km2 to 181 26 km2 6 ln a r e a 1 1569 0 93 ln max d e p Œµ r 2 0 46 n 48 the number of storms used in this study was much greater than used by hsieh 2002 the slope of eq 5 is less than eq 6 because the 48 storm samples hsieh chose were mostly larger storms with clear elliptical shapes in space which may be biased in terms of area representation the decay function to distribute rainfall from the convective storm center to the edge was determined as see fig 4 7 depth max d e p 0 r 0 59 d maxdep 1 r d 0 41 0 59 d r d previous work on walnut gulch has used either an exponential type decay function fogel and duckstein 1969 or simple linear decay function hsieh 2002 to distribute the rainfall from the storm center to the edge however in this study we found that these two methods both underestimate the rainfall total observed from radar images and interpolated rain gage isohyets the convective rain cell tends to have a flat distribution around the center the rationale behind it is that as the storm moves in space it creates a region with relatively uniform maximum depth in the storm center fogel and duckstein 1969 other model parameters including the probabilities for different types of rainfall probabilities for multiple events occurring in a day and the distribution parameters for rainfall amount are shown in table 1 the distribution for convective storm maximum depth was determined to be lognormal with two parameters mean Œº and variance œÉ the fitting plots were shown in supplemental material fig s3 whereas the best fit distribution for frontal and tropical depression storms was determined to be exponential with only one parameter Œº and fitting plots were shown in supplemental material fig s4 notice that the units for convective storms and the other two types are different in table 1 because one is for depth and the other two are for volume 3 2 model evaluation the statistics of observed and simulated convective storm maximum depth from july through september are presented in table 3 the mean value simulated in all six half months with convective storms had less than 6 difference the fact that the simulated storm depths had a broader range of maximum depths is expected since the model was run for 30 sets of 50 year time range in total 1500 years and should include extreme values that were not captured in the historical data the shape of simulated and observed cdf curves for all six periods were similar fig 5 the k s test showed that there were no significant Œ± 0 05 differences between the observed and simulated cdfs in all half month periods the average summer rainfall total of the selected six gages was 192 9 mm whereas the simulated summer rainfall total was 190 4 mm with 1 3 difference table 4 the simulated range of summer rainfall total was almost twice that of the observed values with lesser minimum and greater maximum values consequently the simulated standard deviation was approximately 100 mm which was greater than the observed values which were approximately 60 mm k s test results showed that there was no significant difference between the two curves in summer fig 6 a under Œ± 0 05 significance level the simulated data variability was greater than the historical data could have resulted from more extreme values being simulated in the long synthetic time series this is consistent with the individual convective storms evaluation where some extreme values exceeding the historical records were simulated as for non summer rainfall observed mean of six gages was 122 6 mm and the simulated mean was 122 2 mm table 5 the range of winter rainfall had 15 6 difference between the observed and simulated which is mostly caused by the overestimation of the minimum values the simulated maximum winter rainfall was slightly less than the observed thus the standard deviation was also underestimated by the model compared to historical records the reason for this is related to the method used to distribute the generated the rainfall volume over the watershed since winter frontal storms have less variability than summer convective rainfall for simplicity in this rainfall generator every storm volume was distributed uniformly to all gages only adding a small random variance as a result the variation in both space and time has been lost to some degree the two cdf curves of non summer rainfall total amounts failed the k s test fig 6b which means that there was some difference between the simulated and observed data however the winter storms in walnut gulch rarely cause runoff and erosion due to their low intensity goodrich et al 2008a b nearing et al 2015 so it was considered acceptable to miss some variation in the generated storm depth totals as long as the mean total amount is similar and annual water balance is maintained simulated and observed median lengths of dry and wet spell were shown in table 6 which represents the central tendency of spell length distribution the median of simulated dry spell length was slightly shorter than observed throughout the year whereas the median of simulated wet spell length was longer than observed for summer but the same for non summer months the overestimated wet spell length also caused an overestimation for annual wet spell length the cumulative distribution function curves for seasonal and annual were shown in fig 7 five of the six pairs of observed and simulated curves passed the k s test under Œ± 0 05 significance level the significant difference for the summer wet spell curves indicated that the rainfall generator tends to simulate slightly longer wet periods during summer season 4 conclusion this study presented modeling concepts and processes of a daily spatial stochastic rainfall generator in a semi arid watershed in southeastern arizona unlike most daily rainfall generators which give only the daily rainfall amount this model is capable of simulating individual storms within a day simulation of four elements including daily rainfall occurrence the number of storms per day the maximum depth or total volume of a storm and spatial distribution of the rainfall was illustrated using 50 years of rain gage observations in walnut gulch experimental watershed arizona the separation process of generating three types of rainfall convective frontal and tropical depression is appropriate in this region since they all have quite different physical features the concept of elliptical shape of convective storms works well in this study and has been tested in other research the simulated individual convective storm statistics were similar to the observed the simulated seasonal rainfall performed differently for summer and non summer periods with a slight overestimation of variation of annual summer rainfall and an underestimation of variation in non summer period but the long term mean values of both summer and non summer periods are satisfactory there are limitations for this generator it is a well calibrated model based on the dense rain gage network of walnut gulch experimental watershed and expanding it to larger area application will require additional analysis linking the point statistics with area statistics possible solutions for obtaining larger area statistics such as convective storm area may need incorporation of radar rainfall images this rainfall generator is initially targeted at semi arid watersheds where convective rainfall dominated thus it may not be immediately applicable in regions with significantly different rainfall types possible uses of the rainfall generator include application into hydrological models erosion models as rainfall input where spatial rainfall information could have an impact on runoff response or sediment yield it may also be applied in climate change studies by manipulating model parameters to account for future trends and testing the outcomes developing the rainfall generator into a high resolution temporal model is a future research need which will require further studies of

6429,many semi arid regions of the world experience rainfall patterns characterized by high spatial variability accurate spatial representation of different types of rainfall will facilitate the application of distributed hydrological models in these areas this study presents a daily spatially distributed stochastic rainfall generator based on a first order markov chain model calibrated using 50 years of rainfall observations at 88 gages from 1967 through 2016 in the 148 km2 walnut gulch experimental watershed three types of rainfall including convective frontal and tropical depression storms were simulated separately in the generator using biweekly parameterization convective storms were simulated based on an elliptical shape rain cell conceptual model whereas frontal and tropical depression storms were simulated as uniform rainfall fields over the whole watershed with introduced random variability the rainfall generator was evaluated by comparing the mean statistics of 30 sets of 50 year simulated data versus the 50 year rain gage observed data most individual storm statistics and aggregated seasonal rainfall statistics were similar to the measured rainfall observations the long term mean values of both summer and winter rainfall amount were statistically satisfactory this model can serve as a guide for application in areas with convective frontal and tropical depression storms keywords rainfall generator spatial semi arid convective storm markov chain 1 introduction precipitation is a driving force of many hydrologic processes especially for regions with semi arid and arid climates however the lack of reliable rainfall records limits the development of hydrologic research and applications stochastic rainfall generators can simulate the key characteristics of natural rainfall records wilks and wilby 1999 the advantage of simulated rainfall data is that they can provide long series of statistically representative records which can be used in hydrological models agricultural models or climate change impact assessment to produce mathematically stable statistical representations of hydrologic response for a given weather record as models become more sophisticated the requirements for higher resolution and continuous rainfall series data become more important bonta 2004 breinl et al 2017 li et al 2017 serinaldi 2009 rainfall has both temporal and spatial characteristics that need to be accounted for in the generation process point based rainfall generators which focus on the temporal dimension of rainfall are the most commonly used models arnold and williams 1989 calenda and napolitano 1999 kavvas and delleur 1981 papalexiou et al 2011 richardson 1981 valdes et al 1985 these generators are based on single site observations and therefore not designed to provide spatial resolution researchers have studied the effect of spatially variable rainfall on hydrologic response some studies argued that the spatial variability of rainfall does not cause significant differences in runoff generation or only causes secondary effects beven and hornberger 1982 obled et al 1994 schuurmans and bierkens 2006 these catchment sizes ranged from 71 to 287 km2 which were mostly medium sized rural catchments obled et al 1994 noted that their conclusions may not apply for smaller urbanized or larger rural areas schuurmans and bierkens 2006 found that the spatial variability has a major effect on daily simulation of discharge groundwater level and soil moisture while for general longer term behavior of the hydrological system the areal average rainfall information is adequate koren et al 1999 noted that heterogeneity of rainfall is a major factor for small scale catchments but the fraction of the watershed covered by rainfall is not as important since rainfall is likely to cover the whole area however for larger scales the fractional area of the watershed covered by rainfall is a major factor for runoff generation specific site conditions in terms of either climate characteristics or size of the watershed can lead to quite different conclusions on how spatial rainfall affects hydrological responses in a semi arid region such as is found in much of the southwestern united states where runoff is dominated by summer convective storms transmission losses in ephemeral channels are a significant factor in the water budget goodrich et al 1997 renard et al 1993 thus the spatial distribution of rainfall may matter more in these environments creating distinctive runoff response for upper and lower streams bell and moore 2000 also pointed out that convective rainfall induces more sensitivity in runoff production than does stratiform rainfall to facilitate the accurate modeling of hydrologic response in semi arid regions such as in southeastern arizona a rainfall generator that can simulate non uniform rainfall fields in space is needed it will enhance the ability to apply distributed watershed hydrologic models spatial rainfall generators may use multi site data for a specific region so they can also be referred to as multi site rainfall generators compared with point based generators multi site rainfall generators take spatial correlation between stations into consideration since rainfall stations near enough are not totally independent of each other storms organize into groups and form linear bands or spiral bands under different weather systems in nature shuttleworth 2012 in recent years there has been extensive research conducted on different types of multi site rainfall generator models asong et al 2016 bardossy and plate 1992 breinl et al 2017 evin et al 2018 ferraris et al 2003 leander and buishand 2009 li 2014 mehrotra et al 2006 peleg and morin 2014 serinaldi 2009 wilks 1999 most rainfall generators deal with two major components rainfall occurrence and rainfall amount there are two basic approaches for precipitation occurrence generation one is the richardson type richardson 1981 and the other is serial type racsko et al 1991 the richardson type generator is based on markov chain models which simulates day to day rainfall occurrence using transition probabilities serial type generators account for long term wet or dry trends usually beginning with the simulation of dry and wet series of years and then simulate rainfall amount based on dry and wet conditions there are also basically two types of methods for representing spatial distribution of rainfall amounts the first type focuses on the physical structure of small scale rain cells such as shape and size either using rain gage data cowpertwait et al 1996 ferraris et al 2003 hsieh 2002 von hardenberg et al 2003 or radar images to acquire the parameters morin et al 2006 peleg and morin 2014 2012 the other type considers relatively larger scale rainfall fields usually incorporating mathematical representation of the spatial correlation further classification of this type can include several different methods 1 statistical multi site models usually achieved by fitting empirical distributions for rainfall properties and adding spatial correlation matrix to represent inter sites relation brissette et al 2007 khalili et al 2009 mehrotra and sharma 2007 serinaldi 2009 wilks 1998 2 resampling bootstrap models where rainfall depths were resampled from historical data buishand and brandsma 2001 leander and buishand 2009 recent improvements of resampling methods included adding a reshuffle process to maintain the spatial properties breinl et al 2013 2015 3 nonlinearly filtered autoregressive processes lanza 2000 mej√≠a and rodr√≠guez iturbe 1974 rebora et al 2006 4 generalized linear models asong et al 2016 verdin et al 2018 2015 5 fractal cascade models gupta and waymire 1993 of all the above approaches rain cell models are particularly appropriate to simulate convective storms since these storms share common features of short duration and limited spatial extent osborn et al 1979 generalized linear models have failed to capture the summer convective precipitation characteristics verdin et al 2015 rain cells can either be simulated using circular morin et al 2005 morin and gabella 2007 peleg and morin 2014 or elliptical shapes barnolas et al 2010 peleg and morin 2012 syed et al 2003 the circular shape is easier for modeling since it only has one radius parameter and the intensity distribution can be simplified as well because the cell is isotropic the elliptical shape is more complex since it has both a major and minor axis which also requires an additional orientation parameter it is also necessary to define the center coordinates of the cell and the coverage area for both kinds of cells in addition to cell shape parameters researchers also have studied the representation of rainfall intensity within the cell 1 rain cells with a constant intensity everywhere 2 gaussian decay of intensity from cell center 3 exponential decay of intensity from cell center 4 hybrid of gaussian and exponential decay from cell center the use of constant intensity makes the model simpler but not generally realistic especially when the research focus is on sub daily rain cell development f√©ral et al 2003 noted that the gaussian distribution leads to a faster decay of rainfall intensity from the center outwards but to a lower gradient for the outer part the specific function might differ from region to region which needs further calibration based on actual data in this study we will employ a markov chain based rain cell model to simulate daily spatial rainfall in a semi arid watershed located in southeastern arizona the major objectives are 1 present a conceptual model to characterize the spatial variation of the summer convective rainfall 2 build a stochastic daily rainfall generator capable of simulating three types of rainfall with high spatial resolution that can be used in small to medium sized watersheds and 3 evaluate the performance of the rainfall generator since temporal scale is not the primary consideration in this study we used a daily step in this rainfall generator the richardson type of generator was used for daily rainfall occurrence the geographic area we are concerned about is dominated by convective rainfall during the summer which is suitably represented by a rain cell based generator we combined simulations of individual rain cells to acquire the rainfall field over the entire watershed 2 methods 2 1 study area and data the study area is the walnut gulch experimental watershed located in southeast arizona surrounding the town of tombstone it is a sub watershed of the san pedro river basin the usda ars southwest research center has been operating the watershed since the 1950s with intensive instrumentation and measurement of precipitation the drainage area of walnut gulch is approximately 148 km2 and elevation ranging from 1220 m to 1900 m above sea level the average annual precipitation in this semi arid watershed is approximately 312 mm goodrich et al 2008a following a bimodal pattern with most precipitation occurring in summer and winter seasons osborn 1983 summer rainfall during the months of july august and september accounts for approximately 60 of the total annual amount in this region and results from the north american monsoon nichols et al 2002 stillman et al 2013 the summer rain often forms as convective storms with relatively short duration but high intensity and cover a limited spatial extent the spatial variation of summer convective storms is large the winter frontal storms are however usually of long duration but low intensity and usually cover the whole watershed more uniformly goodrich et al 2008b nearing et al 2015 nichols et al 2002 stillman et al 2013 frontal storms during the non summer months account for approximately 35 of the annual precipitation occasionally snow occurs in winter at the watershed but it melts quickly and does not accumulate the remaining 5 of the annual rainfall falls in the form of tropical depression storms usually dropping large amounts of water much of which will be converted into runoff gochis et al 2006 osborn 1982 walnut gulch experiment watershed has more than sixty years of rainfall monitoring the earliest rainfall record dates back to 1954 the current rain gage network consists of 88 digital rain gages fig 1 which gives an average of approximately 0 6 gage km 2 over the watershed the dense network provides advantages for spatial rainfall analysis especially for the summer convective rainfall events with high spatial variation the full current network of 88 gages was installed by 1967 so this study uses rainfall data from 1967 through 2016 50 years to build the generator from 1967 through 1999 the rainfall data was recorded by analog rain gages while after 2000 digital gages were used goodrich et al 2008a due to resource considerations only nine gages operated out of the monsoon season during the winter months from 1981 through 1991 and in 1999 the reason for this is that winter rainfall in this area is much less spatially variable and the high density of rain gages were not considered necessary goodrich et al 2008a all rainfall data used can be acquired on the website of usda ars swrc the rainfall records are stored in an access database including both daily rainfall and event rainfall the daily data recorded the year month day and total depth received by a certain gage on that day the event data recorded the event id year month day start time duration and depth by a certain gage each day may have multiple events in the database for a gage the resolution for depth is 0 254 mm 0 01 in and the resolution for duration is 1 min 2 2 storm identification a continuous rainfall record consists of both wet periods and dry periods researchers have explored different methods to distinguish events usually based on a threshold of the dry period this threshold can be a fixed time interval for all months such as 6 h used in erosive rainfall studies wischmeier and smith 1978 it can also vary with months depending on the actual distribution of the inter arrival time of rainfall in each month the walnut gulch rainfall database has identified events for each gage separately and assigned an event id to each one the criteria used for each gage in the database was based on a one hour hiatus goodrich et al 2008a however this separation is only for one rain gage which means if two gages received rainfall at the same time they are still assigned different event ids in the database an actual storm occurring in the watershed usually involves more than one gage so it is necessary to identify the individual storms within the entire gage network according to visual perusal of daily rainfall interpolation maps fig s1 in supplemental material we determined that a reasonable storm cell number within one day was no more than five longer thresholds give fewer storms identified for each day since more gage events will be combined the 4 hour threshold to separate and identify storms was selected so that the daily storm numbers were equal to or fewer than five when the event starting times of two gages were within that threshold they are identified to be the same storm in the watershed the maximum depth for each storm was also recorded during the storm identification process 2 3 rainfall occurrence the rainfall generator is built with a richardson type framework using a first order markov chain model richardson 1981 a flow diagram of the computational processes of rainfall generator was shown in fig 2 the basic concept of the first order markov chain method is that the present state of the system only depends on the previous state which translated into the rainfall generation process means that the wet or dry state of the current day depends only on the state of the previous day using the markov approach a wet day is designated if at least one rain gage in the watershed receives rainfall on that day once a wet day is generated for the watershed the model then generates the storm location and coverage which determines how much simulated rainfall each particular gage receives in order to generate a sequence of wet and dry days three transition probabilities need to be calculated p w is the probability of a wet day p w w is the probability of a wet day following a wet day and p w d is the probability of a wet day following a dry day previous research in walnut gulch showed that the transition probabilities for biweekly periods have significant differences from each other hsieh 2002 so all transition probabilities were calculated on a biweekly basis modeling of the wet and dry sequence in the rainfall generator is done by first initializing a random number and then using p w to decide the state of first day after the state of the previous day was decided then the transition probabilities p w w and p w d were used to calculate the state of the next day in each biweekly period for the entire simulation sequence fig 2 when a wet day is generated the type of rainfall also needs to be decided for that day the consensus of most studies on walnut gulch is to separate each year into summer months july september and non summer months goodrich et al 2008a nearing et al 2015 nichols et al 2002 osborn et al 1979 in terms of differentiating rainfall types the dominant type for summer months is convective rainfall while the dominant type for non summer months is frontal rainfall the third type tropical depression rainfall occurs primarily in late summer and fall from september through november gochis et al 2006 probabilities for these three types of rainfall were calculated for each biweekly period using the daily rainfall periods with only one type of rainfall occurrence is straightforward i e the probability of a rainfall to be a frontal type in december and january through june is 1 similarly the probability for convective rainfall in july through august is also 1 the complicated period is from september through november where the probability for tropical depression storms needs to be considered to do this the histogram of all maximum depths of the storms in september through november were plotted and then an exponential distribution was fitted to that histogram the storms with large maximum depth on the histogram tails which could not be fitted well by the exponential curve were identified as tropical depression storms thus their probabilities were calculated using the number of these storms divided by the total number of storms all biweekly periods in september through november share the same probability of tropical depression rainfall and the remainder of the probability for convective and frontal storms in these three months are obtained by subtracting those from 1 thus each day of rainfall as determined by the transition probabilities were categorized as one of the three rainfall types 2 4 rainfall amount and distribution 2 4 1 convective storms convective storms usually show with an approximately elliptical shape in space as determined either from interpolated daily rainfall maps or radar images hsieh 2002 karklinsky and morin 2006 peleg and morin 2012 hsieh 2002 analyzed convective storms in walnut gulch and proposed a conceptual model to characterize them fig 3 this current study followed a similar conceptual model and determined several parameters using rainfall data from july through september collected in 1967 through 2016 the previous study of hsieh 2002 showed that the storm centers are distributed randomly in the watershed sometimes a storm falls only partly within the watershed boundary which means the generated storm center can also be outside the boundary to address this the generator uses a slightly larger area of 26 5 km by 12 5 km divided it into 33 125 cells with each cell representing a 100 m by 100 m area and assigned an index from 1 through 33125 the equation to obtain a storm center location z is 1 z z 33125 where z is the center index ranging from 1 through 33125 and z is the standard uniform deviate ranging from 0 to 1 once the storm center is located a storm center depth is generated from a lognormal distribution and assigned to this storm several distributions were tested for the convective storm maximum depth and the lognormal fit best for the data it is assumed that the depth at the storm center is the maximum and decays to zero on the storm edge a modified linear spread function was applied in the generator fig 4 which maintains constant intensity amount around the center and then follows a linear decay function to the edge 2 depth max d e p 0 r c d max d e p 1 r d 1 c c d r d where depth is the rainfall depth at a certain point inside the storm extent max dep is the maximum depth at storm center d is the distance from the center to the edge passing through at a certain point r is the distance from the center to that point c is a constant between 0 and 1 the calibration of c was made by matching the simulated total summer rainfall amount to the observed rainfall the storm area is related to the maximum depth of the storm after logarithmic transformation a linear regression was built between the area and the maximum depth 3 ln a r e a a 0 a 1 ln max d e p Œµ where the units for storm area is km2 and the units for maximum depth is mm a0 and a1 are the coefficients of the linear regression equation Œµ is a random error term an elliptical shaped storm has two axes the major axis a and the minor axis b the ratio c between them is defined as c a b the value of c follows a normal distribution distribution parameters were acquired from hsieh 2002 the simulated ratio was bounded between one standard deviation around the mean when both the area and the ratio has been chosen for a storm the length of major and minor axis can be calculated from the area equation of an ellipse the last parameter for a convective storm is the orientation it is defined as the counter clockwise angle starting from the east the orientation for a storm is between 0 and 180 degrees and follows a normal distribution distribution parameters were acquired from hsieh 2002 the simulated orientation was bounded between one standard deviation around the mean and extreme values beyond the 0 to 180 degrees range were discarded until a new value within the range was generated 2 4 2 frontal storms the frontal storms in non summer months have much less spatial variation than do the convective storms osborn et al 1979 analyzed data from walnut gulch in non monsoon months suggesting that nine gages are adequate to represent the variability of frontal storms rainfall interpolation maps in non monsoon months also showed this pattern since frontal storms usually cover the whole walnut gulch for simplicity it is assumed that every frontal storm covers the entire watershed in the generation process the total volume of water of each frontal storm is an important factor for quantifying annual water balance but from a hydrologic standpoint winter frontal storms do not generate runoff in the channels at walnut gulch goodrich et al 2008a b nearing et al 2015 the 88 rain gages are nearly uniformly distributed in the watershed which means the area represented by each gage is approximately the same the total volume of water that a storm delivers can be calculated by the following equation 4 vol d e p avg u n i t a r e a n where vol is the total volume of each frontal storm depavg is the average depth of all gages receiving rainfall unit area is the area of one gage represented n is the number of gages receiving rainfall notice that the unit area is not a constant value throughout all the years because with the deletion or addition of gages over time the number of gages in the full network changed during the recording period different unit area values needed to be calculated for different years data from 1967 through 1980 1992 through 1998 and 2000 through 2016 were used to fit a distribution for the total volume of water per storm for each biweekly period the extremely large values on the tails during september through november fit poorly with the overall distribution curve fig s2 which indicates that they follow a different underlying mechanism those storms were considered as tropical depression storms and were excluded from the dataset when building the distribution for frontal storms the model simulation will randomly pick a storm volume from the distribution curve of each biweekly period first spread it evenly in the whole watershed with each grid having the average depth calculated based on the volume and then added some randomness for each grid the random difference added to each grid is based on the standard deviations of the observed rainfall fields and each standard deviation is corresponded to a certain average storm depth in order to provide a reasonable variation of the generated rainfall fields the added randomness is allowed to fluctuate between negative to positive two standard deviations 2 4 3 tropical depression storms the algorithm to generate tropical depression storms is similar to that of frontal storms the difference is that these storms are much less frequent and the volume of water dropped by this type is much larger than by frontal storms gochis et al 2006 osborn 1982 in the previous steps the extreme values of storm volumes in september through november were excluded and all these values were fit to a separate distribution which was used for the tropical depression storms unlike the frontal storms numbers of identified tropical depression storms were limited so only one distribution was fit for the entire september through november period the model simulation will randomly pick a storm volume from the distribution first spread it evenly in the whole watershed and then add some randomness to each grid the random difference added to each grid is based on the standard deviations of the observed rainfall fields and each standard deviation is corresponded to a certain average storm depth in order to provide a reasonable variation of the generated rainfall fields the added randomness is allowed to fluctuate between negative to positive two standard deviations 2 5 multiple events in a day the results in the hsieh 2002 model underestimated the total summer rainfall of each gage partly because the model only simulated one storm per day studies from radar analysis have shown that convective rainfall generally consists of several rain cells in one day morin et al 2004 peleg and morin 2014 2012 thus the ability to simulate multiple events per day were enabled in this rainfall generator both convective storms and frontal storms can have multiple events per day whereas the tropical depression storm remained as single event per day because of their sizes and durations based on the storm identification process in previous section probabilities for different numbers of storms occurring in a single day may be calculated for example the probability of two events per day is made by counting the number of days with two storms and then dividing it by the number of total rainy days in a biweekly period convective rainfall would allow up to five storms per day while frontal rainfall would allow up to three storms per day in this rainfall generator calibration of multiple events probabilities is based on controlling the total number of storms over the fifty year period for instance if the total number of storms is overestimated then the probability of more than one event was adjusted lower by multiplying a coefficient between 0 and 1 consequently probabilities for one event will be adjusted higher to maintain that the sum of all probabilities adding to one 2 6 statistics statistical analyses were performed using matlab the regression equation between convective storm area and maximum depth was based on 4152 convective storms identified in 50 years with maximum depth ranging from 0 25 mm to 95 12 mm and storm area ranging from 1 59 km2 to 152 94 km2 statistical distribution types were determined for convective storm maximum depths and frontal storm and tropical depression storm volumes by comparing the empirical probability distributions to several theoretical distribution functions such as lognormal gamma and exponential the kolmogorov smirnov test k s test was used to test the similarity of the empirical distribution to the theoretical ones using a significance level of Œ± 0 05 if more than one theoretical distribution passed the k s test then the one with least number of parameters was selected in further modelling processing after the selection of distribution type distribution parameters were fit for each type of rainfall as described previously 2 7 model evaluation the rainfall generator was run for 30 sets of 50 year simulation in total 1500 years to obtain a sequence of simulated daily rainfall and then compared with the observed 50 years historical rainfall data model performance was evaluated in two aspects individual storm statistics and seasonally aggregated rainfall statistics previous research goodrich et al 2008a nearing et al 2015 nichols et al 2002 divided the year into summer months july september and non summer months october december january june which is adopted in this study as well the convective storm type was evaluated to determine whether the proposed conceptual model was able to capture the major storm characteristics seasonally aggregated rainfall amounts were evaluated based on the simulation results of six gages gage id 13 34 44 46 62 80 these gages were relatively evenly distributed inside the watershed and were selected as a sample to calculate the seasonal rainfall statistics of both simulated individual storms and aggregated rainfall including the mean standard deviation maximum minimum range and skewness were computed and compared with the 50 year observed data in addition simulated and observed cumulative distribution functions cdfs were created for both individual storms and aggregated rainfall k s tests were performed between simulated and observed cdfs to determine whether they belonged to the same statistical distribution time series properties were evaluated through dry and wet spell lengths of simulated and observed rainfall data the cumulative distribution function curves of both dry and wet spells were created for summer non summer and annual periods seasonal and annual median lengths of dry and wet spells were also calculated for comparison k s tests were performed between simulated and observed cdfs to determine whether they belonged to the same statistical distributions 3 results and discussion 3 1 rainfall characterization the transition probabilities for rainfall occurrence somewhere on the watershed for the 24 half month periods are shown in table 1 the probability of wet p w clearly showed that rainfall frequency reaches its peak in summer exceeding 0 5 from the first half of july to the first half of september the second wettest period is in winter from december through february where p w ranges from 0 2 to 0 3 p w w is always greater than p w d which means that wet days tend to be clustered together axis ratio and orientation statistics were acquired from hsieh 2002 those parameters were measured directly from interpolated rainfall surfaces and shown in table 2 the mean value of axis ratio was 1 54 which is slightly greater than that found in previous work on walnut gulch which showed a major to minor axis ratio of between 1 0 and 1 5 fogel and duckstein 1969 the mean value of orientation found in hsieh 2002 was 91 40 which points generally north as defined in the previous section the area statistics acquired in this study showed a mean of 58 01 km2 which is approximately one third of the watershed area the regression equation of area and maximum depth see eq 3 was determined as 5 ln a r e a 2 1784 0 6851 ln max d e p Œµ r 2 0 57 n 4152 hsieh 2002 using data also from walnut gulch developed a similar regression equation eq 6 between area and maximum depth from 48 interpolated storm surfaces with the maximum depth ranging from 4 83 mm to 47 75 mm and storm areas ranging from 3 6 km2 to 181 26 km2 6 ln a r e a 1 1569 0 93 ln max d e p Œµ r 2 0 46 n 48 the number of storms used in this study was much greater than used by hsieh 2002 the slope of eq 5 is less than eq 6 because the 48 storm samples hsieh chose were mostly larger storms with clear elliptical shapes in space which may be biased in terms of area representation the decay function to distribute rainfall from the convective storm center to the edge was determined as see fig 4 7 depth max d e p 0 r 0 59 d maxdep 1 r d 0 41 0 59 d r d previous work on walnut gulch has used either an exponential type decay function fogel and duckstein 1969 or simple linear decay function hsieh 2002 to distribute the rainfall from the storm center to the edge however in this study we found that these two methods both underestimate the rainfall total observed from radar images and interpolated rain gage isohyets the convective rain cell tends to have a flat distribution around the center the rationale behind it is that as the storm moves in space it creates a region with relatively uniform maximum depth in the storm center fogel and duckstein 1969 other model parameters including the probabilities for different types of rainfall probabilities for multiple events occurring in a day and the distribution parameters for rainfall amount are shown in table 1 the distribution for convective storm maximum depth was determined to be lognormal with two parameters mean Œº and variance œÉ the fitting plots were shown in supplemental material fig s3 whereas the best fit distribution for frontal and tropical depression storms was determined to be exponential with only one parameter Œº and fitting plots were shown in supplemental material fig s4 notice that the units for convective storms and the other two types are different in table 1 because one is for depth and the other two are for volume 3 2 model evaluation the statistics of observed and simulated convective storm maximum depth from july through september are presented in table 3 the mean value simulated in all six half months with convective storms had less than 6 difference the fact that the simulated storm depths had a broader range of maximum depths is expected since the model was run for 30 sets of 50 year time range in total 1500 years and should include extreme values that were not captured in the historical data the shape of simulated and observed cdf curves for all six periods were similar fig 5 the k s test showed that there were no significant Œ± 0 05 differences between the observed and simulated cdfs in all half month periods the average summer rainfall total of the selected six gages was 192 9 mm whereas the simulated summer rainfall total was 190 4 mm with 1 3 difference table 4 the simulated range of summer rainfall total was almost twice that of the observed values with lesser minimum and greater maximum values consequently the simulated standard deviation was approximately 100 mm which was greater than the observed values which were approximately 60 mm k s test results showed that there was no significant difference between the two curves in summer fig 6 a under Œ± 0 05 significance level the simulated data variability was greater than the historical data could have resulted from more extreme values being simulated in the long synthetic time series this is consistent with the individual convective storms evaluation where some extreme values exceeding the historical records were simulated as for non summer rainfall observed mean of six gages was 122 6 mm and the simulated mean was 122 2 mm table 5 the range of winter rainfall had 15 6 difference between the observed and simulated which is mostly caused by the overestimation of the minimum values the simulated maximum winter rainfall was slightly less than the observed thus the standard deviation was also underestimated by the model compared to historical records the reason for this is related to the method used to distribute the generated the rainfall volume over the watershed since winter frontal storms have less variability than summer convective rainfall for simplicity in this rainfall generator every storm volume was distributed uniformly to all gages only adding a small random variance as a result the variation in both space and time has been lost to some degree the two cdf curves of non summer rainfall total amounts failed the k s test fig 6b which means that there was some difference between the simulated and observed data however the winter storms in walnut gulch rarely cause runoff and erosion due to their low intensity goodrich et al 2008a b nearing et al 2015 so it was considered acceptable to miss some variation in the generated storm depth totals as long as the mean total amount is similar and annual water balance is maintained simulated and observed median lengths of dry and wet spell were shown in table 6 which represents the central tendency of spell length distribution the median of simulated dry spell length was slightly shorter than observed throughout the year whereas the median of simulated wet spell length was longer than observed for summer but the same for non summer months the overestimated wet spell length also caused an overestimation for annual wet spell length the cumulative distribution function curves for seasonal and annual were shown in fig 7 five of the six pairs of observed and simulated curves passed the k s test under Œ± 0 05 significance level the significant difference for the summer wet spell curves indicated that the rainfall generator tends to simulate slightly longer wet periods during summer season 4 conclusion this study presented modeling concepts and processes of a daily spatial stochastic rainfall generator in a semi arid watershed in southeastern arizona unlike most daily rainfall generators which give only the daily rainfall amount this model is capable of simulating individual storms within a day simulation of four elements including daily rainfall occurrence the number of storms per day the maximum depth or total volume of a storm and spatial distribution of the rainfall was illustrated using 50 years of rain gage observations in walnut gulch experimental watershed arizona the separation process of generating three types of rainfall convective frontal and tropical depression is appropriate in this region since they all have quite different physical features the concept of elliptical shape of convective storms works well in this study and has been tested in other research the simulated individual convective storm statistics were similar to the observed the simulated seasonal rainfall performed differently for summer and non summer periods with a slight overestimation of variation of annual summer rainfall and an underestimation of variation in non summer period but the long term mean values of both summer and non summer periods are satisfactory there are limitations for this generator it is a well calibrated model based on the dense rain gage network of walnut gulch experimental watershed and expanding it to larger area application will require additional analysis linking the point statistics with area statistics possible solutions for obtaining larger area statistics such as convective storm area may need incorporation of radar rainfall images this rainfall generator is initially targeted at semi arid watersheds where convective rainfall dominated thus it may not be immediately applicable in regions with significantly different rainfall types possible uses of the rainfall generator include application into hydrological models erosion models as rainfall input where spatial rainfall information could have an impact on runoff response or sediment yield it may also be applied in climate change studies by manipulating model parameters to account for future trends and testing the outcomes developing the rainfall generator into a high resolution temporal model is a future research need which will require further studies of
