24310,one central issue in coffee leaf rust hemileia vastatrix epidemiology is to understand what determines the intensity and the timing of yearly infections in coffee plantations however most experimental and theoretical studies report infection as an average at the plot level obscuring the role of potentially key factors like rust dispersal or the planting pattern here we first review the rust epidemic patterns of different sites which reveal large variability in the duration and magnitude of the different epidemiologic phases we then present a spatially explicit and parametrised model where the host population is subdivided into discrete patches linked through spore dispersal modeled as simple diffusion with this model we study the role of the planting arrangement the dispersal intensity and plant level variables on the maximum average tree infection mati and its timing our results suggest that the epidemic timeline can be divided into two phases a time lag and a growth phase per se the model shows that the combination of the dispersal magnitude and plant aggregation modifies the mati and the time to mati mainly by preventing some plants from reaching their maximum peak during the epidemic it also affects the epidemic curves which can have a stepped or a rather smooth pattern in plots with otherwise similar conditions the initial rust infection modulates the time lag before the epidemic and the infected leaf fall rate drastically changes the mati these findings highlight the importance of explicitly considering the spatial aspects of coffee agroecosystems when measuring and managing rust infection and help us to further understand the spatio temporal dynamics of ecological systems in general keywords coffee leaf rust infection dispersal epidemiology dynamical modeling data availability all code and data to reproduce results in the work can be accessed at https github com tenayuco dispersion plant arrangement coffeerust infection 1 introduction the first recorded epidemic of the coffee rust disease caused by the fungus hemileia vastatrix broke out in ceylon now sri lanka in 1869 talhinhas et al 2017 since then coffee rust has spread across the continents reaching virtually all the coffee plantations areas on earth avelino et al 2006 mccook and vandermeer 2015 this is particularly relevant for farmers who depend economically on these crops one central issue in coffee rust epidemiology is to understand what determines the intensity of a one year infection avelino et al 2006 gagliardi et al 2020 kushalappa and eskes 1989 motisi et al 2022 similarly many epidemiologists have sought to estimate the time to maximum infection for the design of specific control practices ananth 1969 burdekin 1964 both questions have been studied within the disease triangle framework stevens 1960 in this sense scientists and farmers have studied the pathogen s properties such as its genetics carvalho et al 2011 the host resistance and phenology avelino et al 1993 silva et al 2006 and disease environmental drivers such as the temperature humidity or precipitation avelino et al 2015 nevertheless there is a large amount of variability in the intensity and timing of the different epidemiological phases of the coffee rust epidemic that remains unexplained even between neighbouring coffee plots with the same environmental and biotic conditions li et al 2022 for example in some plantations when the abiotic and biotic conditions for rust invasion are met the infection may not start right away there is a highly variable time lag boudrot et al 2016 mulinge and griffiths 1974 to explain this variability previous research has mainly focused on the infection phase per se where susceptible leaves are infected by coffee rust spores and become infective talhinhas et al 2017 and has overlooked another epidemiological phase dispersal dispersal is the process by which spores are transported from one place to another across different scales ranging from the intraleaf interleaf or even the interplot scale becker and kranz 1977 boudrot et al 2016 vandermeer et al 2018 overall the intensity of an epidemic is highly related to the rates of infection and dispersal during each season avelino et al 2015 analysis of dispersal is thus called for and by its very nature must incorporate a spatial approach avelino et al 2012 there are effectively two distinct scales of dispersal first the large scale mediated by the wind and resulting from a rain of spores over large areas between plots or between farms becker and kranz 1977 bowden et al 1971 kushalappa and eskes 1989 and second the local scale corresponding to neighbouring plants in a plot and or leaves on the same plant caused mainly by insect vectors splash wind gusts and human action during harvest becker and kranz 1977 vandermeer et al 2018 in this work we will focus on the local plant to plant dispersal scale in a plot intuitively higher local dispersal should lead to more severe epidemics in a plot however despite the importance of a nuanced understanding of rust epidemic dynamics within plots most empirical studies on coffee rust epidemics report rust prevalence in terms of averages within a plot and not on individual trees bock 1962a burdekin 1964 this method reduces the sampling errors and smooths the epidemic curves but may obscure the relationship between plant and plot dynamics mediated by dispersal besides coffee plantations can be arranged in rows or follow a more random arrangement depending on the age type rustic or conventional or size of the plantation hajian forooshani and vandermeer 2021 moguel and toledo 1999 therefore coffee rust dispersal effect might be modulated by these planting patterns hajian forooshani and vandermeer 2021 vandermeer et al 2018 finally the relative importance of the dispersal between plants and the plant level infection dynamics such as the initial infection or the rust infected leaf fall rate on the plot level rust epidemics has not been fully assessed or considered in current dynamic models but see park et al 2001 a dynamical modeling approach at both the plant and plot scales can help to disentangle such multi scaled relations and processes and shed light on the role of dispersal on the maximum infection prevalence we will refer here to maximum infection and the time to reach it in coffee plantations we hypothesise that spatial dynamics and coffee rust dispersal might also play a role in the variability of the timing and magnitude of the different rust epidemiological phases in coffee plots with otherwise similar biotic and abiotic conditions we thus seek to explore the determinants of a the plot averaged maximum infection and b its timing using a parametrised epidemiological six susceptible infected external inoculum model in a spatially structured host population with this model we analyze the role of the intensity of rust dispersal planting arrangements initial infection and plant level dynamics such as the fall rate of an infected leaf on the epidemiological outcomes 2 methods we first reviewed quantitative and qualitative data on the maximum infection and the number of days to reach this maximum in different coffee systems from these data we estimated the duration of the different coffee rust epidemiological phases and their variability and used them for future validation of the model secondly we built a spatially explicit model to study the role of planting arrangement dispersal intensity plant level dynamics and initial conditions on the variability detected in the spatially averaged maximum coffee rust infection and its timing details are presented below but the overall work route was the following we first constructed the model and parametrised it then we implemented different computational scenarios at the plant and plot level and studied their effect on the maximum infection growth phase and time lags 2 1 reviewing the qualitative dynamics of coffee rust infection to study the qualitative behavior of coffee rust infections we reviewed literature reporting data on coffee rust at coffee sites with different climatic orographic and management conditions we used data from studies that presented at least a 12 month time series rainfall pattern and in some cases the harvesting period we explored publications reporting all these data from the 1960 s to the present since most of the reviewed works do not report tables or do not follow a uniform procedure we extracted both the rainfall and coffee rust infection data directly from the graphs using webplotdigitizer drevon et al 2017 rohatgi 2020 we transformed all dates to their corresponding julian day number and all the precipitation histograms to millimetres some graphs started on day 250 september 7th and others on day 1 january 1st fig 2 we considered three time series from chiapas méxico avelino et al 1991 vandermeer et al 2018 two from central america quetzaltenango guatemala and turrialaba costa rica avelino et al 1993 boudrot et al 2016 one from south india mysore ananth 1969 and three from kenya east riff ruiru and kiambu becker and kranz 1977 bock 1962a mulinge and griffiths 1974 in the case of ruiru kenya rainfall was not directly reported so we used the rainfall pattern reported for nairobi which has similar climatic conditions ndolo et al 2017 in some cases coffee rust infection was reported as the average percentage of rust infected leaves per tree in others as spores counted per tree or spores in the immediate vicinity rainfall was reported on a daily or monthly basis and we grouped the daily data in months when the harvesting period was reported we added it manually adding a ten day error to each end for each site we reviewed the duration of the different epidemiological phases the maximum infection reached and their relationship with rainfall and harvesting period we defined the beginning of the rainy season as the middle of the first month that averaged precipitations higher than 50 mm and the beginning of the epidemic growth period per se as the moment when the increase in the reported percentage of infected leaves in the trees was higher than 0 1 per day the time between these two points was defined as the time lag other characteristics of the plantations such as the climatic orographic and management conditions are included in the supplementary material s2 the general timings and magnitudes of infection on these sites were also compared to the predictions of our parametrised model 2 2 six model construction we modeled the dynamics of multiple individual plants including both infection and internal leaf to leaf spore dispersal processes coupled in a plot through a plant to plant dispersal mechanism the overall modeling strategy is shown in fig 1 and can be summarised as follows we first defined a 10 10 lattice 100 cells with sink boundaries and 50 trees n in four different scenarios of planting arrangements aggregated random rows and spaced fig 1b these arrangements aim to represent the different patterns reported in coffee plots where trees can be closely surrounded by other trees aggregated or have direct neighbours in one specific direction rows or have no direct neighbours spaced or have a random arrangement black squares represent the trees with susceptible or infected leaves as well as the immediate space around the tree where external uredospores may be present white squares represent regions of space where only uredospores might be present s i 0 in eq 2 2 fig 1b we characterised the four different planting arrangements with a distance between plant index h defined as eq 2 1 2 1 h n i 1 n h i h i j 1 4 1 d ji 4 where n is the number of plants per plot and hi is the average of the inverse distance number of squares between plant i and its four closest neighbours j dji along the horizontal and vertical axis if there are no neighbours along a particular direction we set 1 dji 0 in the case of the random arrangement we ran 30 configurations and presented the average since we chose the same number of trees for all the scenarios n 50 h only depends on the spatial arrangement of plants fig 1b each tree follows the two main phases of the coffee rust life cycle host pathogen interaction invasion and pathogen dispersal whose dynamics are schematized in fig 1a and are described by the following system of coupled differential equations eq 2 2 2 2 d s i dt ρ k s i β 1 x i s i k β 2 i i s i k d i i dt β 1 x i s i k β 2 i i s i k γ i i d x i dt α i i μ x i m j 1 v i x ji v i x i where si and ii are the amounts of susceptible and infected leaves in tree i ii represents the state where the infected leaf has already produced new infective spores xi represents the number of infective external uredospores from now on external spores supplementary material s3 bock 1962b in square i with or without a tree xi does not include spores in the leaves or between them only the ones that are outside the tree host reproduction i e leaf production and leaf fall rate of susceptible leaves is represented by the so called monomolecular growth cunniffe and gilligan 2010 where the natural or non infected leaf fall rate is represented by ρ and leaf production rate is equivalent to kρ where k is the carrying capacity of susceptible leaves we took k 1 for simplicity but our results can be rescaled by using reported values for k burdekin 1964 this assumes that the new leaf production rate equals the leaf fall rate of susceptible leaves the transition from s to i is subdivided into primary infection arising from the external spores x and secondary infection occurring by transmission from already infected leaves i in both cases the growth in infection is proportional to the fraction of remaining susceptible leaves s k and to the rates β1 β2 respectively infected leaves can fall and leave the i compartment at a rate ɣ that must be higher than the non infected leaf fall rate ρ spores detach from infected leaves and become suspended in the air or fall on the ground filling the x compartment at a rate α external spores die at rate μ both in squares with and without trees black and white cells in fig 1b finally m is the diffusion rate which represents the rate at which spores are dispersed to the neighbouring squares let us denote as vi the number of immediate neighbours of square i ranging from two to four depending on the location of the square in the lattice and xji the amount of x in the j th neighbour of i non directed dispersal is modeled by a diffusion process that takes place from one plant to its four immediate neighbouring squares mimicking short ranged rust dispersal mediated by splash and plant to plant contact in our two directional planting arrangements note that equivalent scenarios could be modeled using an 8 neighbourhood vicinity but in order to create the spaced arrangement we would have to push trees further away from each other in empty squares si ii 0 so the spores have the following dynamic d x i dt m j 1 v i x ji v i x i all the parameters are summarised in table 1 our model is a spatially extended case of the sirx susceptible infected removed external inoculum models analyzed by cunniffe and gilligan 2010 and gubbins et al 2000 originally developed for insect pathogen interactions but widely used for plant pathogen associations swinton and anderson 1995 here we did not include the removed compartment r since its dynamic is determined by the other compartments and does not impact the whole infection process this assumption is discussed in the discussion section in this sense our model can be referred to as a six model we assume that infection happens in non resistant coffee trees with well mixed leaves when the conditions for the development of coffee rust are optimal sufficient susceptible leaves and humidity nutman et al 1963 factors like plant or rust variability are not explicitly considered nor the change in abiotic conditions in this work we do not study the equilibrium points but rather some of the most relevant transient dynamics of coffee rust epidemics like the duration of the growth phase or the maximum infection as well as the probability of rust invasion in each individual plant but see cunniffe and gilligan 2010 for the linear analysis of the model and the supplementary material s1 for the equilibrium points the invasion criteria is summarised by the parameter r0 which is defined as eq 2 3 2 3 r 0 β 2 β 1 α μ γ if r0 is less than 1 the single plant system always reaches a non infective equilibrium if r0 1 i and x invade and s decreases see fig s1 1 and cunniffe and gilligan 2010 for the main mathematical results on this model 2 3 plant level parameterization and simulation conditions we selected the infected leaf fall rate ɣ as the sole plant level variable and fixed the other parameters of the six equation primary and secondary infection recruitment leaf growth and spore death rates we chose the infected leaf fall rate as it is a variable that can be directly modified by human management e g removing and bagging away the infected leaves the other parameters such as the infection rates are affected by multiple environmental genetic and management processes and are more difficult to control besides this decision reduces our computational explorations and simplifies the interpretation of the results to choose the values of the plant level parameters correctly and work with meaningful timescales we estimated the range of each plant or spore parameter from reported data table 1 bock 1962a boudrot et al 2016 deepak et al 2012 firman and wallis 1965 gagliardi et al 2020 leguizamón caycedo et al 1998 mulinge and griffiths 1974 nutman et al 1963 rakocevic and takeshi matsunaga 2018 rayner 1961 silva acuña et al 1999 we then set each parameter to the mean value for our general simulations but we included a sensitivity analysis of our results using the lowest and highest values of the estimated ranges the infected leaf fall rate ɣ was varied above its estimated mean to account for leaf removal practices that shorten the time for a rusted leaf to fall e g selective pruning but we restricted its maximum value to simulate scenarios where rust invades the system this is where r0 1 considering the other estimated parameters eq 2 3 the detailed methods for the estimation of each parameter are available in the supplementary material s3 to summarise the model parameters can be estimated from the characteristic time scale in days of a given known process we first looked for studies that reported those times directly or indirectly if these data were not available we fitted specific time series of leaf infection to linear or exponential models table 1 2 4 simulations and measured variables mati and time to mati with the chosen parameters we explored the effect of the leaf fall rate of infected leaves ɣ the initial proportion of infected leaves per tree i0 the planting patterns and the different plant to plant diffusion rates m on the maximum averaged tree infection henceforth mati and the time to reach this maximum in days fig 1c the mati is obtained by averaging tree infection over all trees in the plot for every time step and then by identifying its overall maximum this is a common indicator to measure rust infections in the field the time to mati was divided into a time lag and a growth period per se following the same criteria used in real time series see section 2 1 and fig 1c the results were then compared with the magnitudes measured in section 2 1 and analyzed in each combination of scenarios 2 4 1 one plant level simulations we first ran simulations of the six model at the single tree level n 1 m 0 and i 1 studying the effect of both the ɣ and i0 on the mati and the time to mati in this scenario the mati is the maximum local tree infection we varied the leaf fall rate of infected leaves ɣ from 0 015 to 0 14 and the initial proportion of infected leaves per tree i0 from 0 001 to 0 1 72 scenarios in total each simulation started with i0 infected leaves i i0 1 i0 susceptible leaves s 1 i0 no external uredospores x 0 and ran for 30 000 integration steps using the euler method δt 0 01 this method is a standard and common integration procedure for solving discretized partial differential equations in lattices koch and meinhardt 1994 elder et al 1992 and is sufficiently robust and precise for all our modeled scenarios and quantities of interest with a δt 0 02 there were no differences in the results within the range of precision used fig s1 6 these integration steps represented 300 days after parameter calibration the beginning of the simulation corresponds to the start of the optimal conditions for infection when humidity is sufficient and leaves are susceptible and we chose 300 days to be the maximum time for the rust to reach the maximum peak of infection in one year following the times reported in fig 2 after this rust infection is assumed to decrease this time limit sets a maximum simulation time 2 4 2 plot level simulations the next step was to run the full model in the 10 10 lattice to include the effects of spatial arrangement and diffusion rate on the mati and time to mati we defined scenarios with the four different planting arrangements aggregated spaced random and rows one initially infected tree in the centre of the lattice x y 5 6 two values of initially infected leaves i0 0 001 and i0 0 1 and five different levels of diffusion rate m across three orders of magnitude ranging from 0 001 to 0 1 or expressed in log for a better visualisation from 3 to 1 we also chose two of the values of γ used in the single plant dynamic 0 015 0 056 to compare the plant and plot level results for the random planting we took averages over 30 simulations for each combination of the parameters for each scenario we obtained the mati and the time to mati as a function of the diffusion rate initial infection and h we also included the time evolution of the average tree infection with two representative diffusion values log m 3 log m 2 as we consider t 300 days the results of the scenarios can be divided into two cases a when an infection peak is attained before the 300 days and b when the optimal conditions for rust cease before the peak is reached creating a maximum at 300 days finally in order to explore the relationship between individual and average dynamics we registered the values of each tree s maximum infection and timing and grouped the number of trees that reached a high level of infection more than 70 of infected leaves during the same 15 day period focusing both on the level of infection of individual trees and their degree of temporal overlapping can shed light on the determinants of the average infection dynamics 2 4 3 computational implementation the model and simulations were implemented in the python 3 7 3 programming language using the modules numpy scipy pandas seaborn and ran on the lancis facilities at the ecology institute of unam the data analyzes and figures were done in rstudio 1 2 1335 using plyr dplyr tidyverse ggplot2 and patchwork libraries and inkscape 1 0 all code and data to reproduce results in the work can be accessed at https github com tenayuco dispersion plant arrangement coffeerust infection 3 results 3 1 trends in qualitative dynamics coffee rust infection seasonality and variability in time lags growth phase and maximum infection fig 2 depicts different coffee rust infection dynamics observed in nine sites the corresponding rainfall and when reported the harvesting period each infection is measured either as the average percentage of rusted leaves per tree or as the average number of spores during at least one year green bar at the bottom of each plot plotting the time series together enables us to visualise similarities and differences firstly rust infection follows a basic epidemiological cycle consisting of a time lag in relation to the beginning of the rainy season followed by a growth and a decline phase coffee rust infection also seems to have a rain forced periodicity the growth phase always starts after the onset of the rain season this is clearer for fig 2a c where more than one year is reported this forced periodicity is related to the first phases of the coffee rust infection cycle where rain is necessary for spores liberation and invasion the infection reaches a maximum value and declines when the rain season is ongoing d h or has ended a c f g in kenya where there are two rainy seasons per year we observe two peaks of infection fig 2b e h the second peaks are substantially lower than the first peaks in east riff and ruiru sites but they are qualitatively relevant to the general dynamics b h as they show that a new infection process began the time lag is 82 days on average ranging from 24 5 b to 146 days c see table s1 1 in sites with two rainy seasons the lag shortens fig 2b e h in some cases coffee rust infection is negligible during the lag fig 2c d f g the growth phase takes 119 days on average ranging from 68 i to 181 days c table s1 1 it is worth noting that the coffee rust infection cycle takes about 30 days therefore rust probably undergoes multiple infection cycles during one epidemiological phase as discussed in kushalappa and eskes 1989 the time to maximum infection comprises the time lag and the growth phase and ranges from 95 i to 325 days c the maximum average tree infection ranges in turn from 20 to 80 of infected leaves per tree therefore the timing and intensity of an infection at a given site are largely variable interestingly the harvesting period correlates with the build up growth phase fig 2a c g i see the discussion section all values for the mati and time to mati are summarised in table s1 1 3 2 estimation of the parameters of the six model in a rust infected scenario we estimated the natural non infected leaf fall time primary and secondary infection and spore death rates directly from reported data supplementary material s3 table 1 the leaf fall time of susceptible leaves 1 ρ ranges between 74 and 108 days β1 and β2 can both be interpreted as the inverse of the time taken for one susceptible leaf to become infected either for being in contact with external spores or with an infected leaf if we assume that one package of external spores infects one leaf at a time this is nsp ninf 1 both times are equal and range from 25 to 30 days 1 β1 and 1 β2 finally the uredospore viability goes from 3 to 10 days 1 μ table 1 the time taken for a newly infected leaf to fall 1 ɣ was estimated indirectly as how much shorter this time was in comparison to 1 ρ infected leaves take on average from 35 to 53 days less than susceptible leaves to fall we express ɣ as ρ ρi where ρi is the increment in leaf fall rate due to coffee rust infection the recruitment rate α range is broad 0 1 1 2 since it was estimated indirectly from several studies table 1 we use ρ 0 011 hence the mean value of ɣ is equal to 0 015 table 1 given the values chosen for the other parameters here the invasion criterion can be expressed as r0 0 15 ɣ 1 see eq 2 3 and fig s1 1 in this sense to simulate rust infected scenarios and to account for leaf removal practices see section 2 3 ɣ was varied between 0 015 to 0 14 r0 1 10 3 3 in one plant simulations ɣ affects both the mati and time to mati and i0 affects the time to mati through the time lag fig 3 a b display the maximum averaged tree infection mati and the days to mati for one tree simulations n 1 varying the leaf fall rate ɣ and initial proportion of infected leaves i0 mati decreases with the infected leaf fall rate fig 3a c when ɣ is equal 0 015 the maximum infection is around 75 when ɣ is higher than 0 1 mati drops to zero this effect is independent of the number of infected leaves in the systems equilibria predicted by r0 section 2 3 fig s1 3 see fig s1 1 for the influence of ɣ on equilibria and stability i0 does not affect the mati whatsoever fig 3d time to mati is affected by both ɣ fig 3b c and i0 fig 3b d in general when ɣ increases the time to reach mati increases because the curve flattens fig 3c affecting the growth phase duration but not necessarily the time lag see fig 2 on the other hand when i0 is low the time to mati increases without changing the mati fig 3b d in other terms i0 affects the time lag but not the growth phase per se fig 3d when mati drops to 0 with high values of ɣ the time to mati is not relevant since the maximum infection can be reached at the beginning of the simulation 3 4 in the spatially explicit model diffusion rate and the planting arrangement jointly modify mati and days to mati in a threshold dependent manner and modify the curves of infection while i0 modulates the time lag and γ decreases the mati in all scenarios we plotted in fig 4 the mati and time to mati for each combination of planting arrangement diffusion and initial conditions i0 and in fig 5 the time evolution of the average tree infection with two representative diffusion values log m 3 log m 2 we used two values of γ 0 015 0 056 but as the results were qualitatively similar we only present the plots here for γ 0 015 but see fig s1 7 for the case of γ 0 056 as we explained in the methods sections results are divided into two cases a when an infection peak is attained before the 300 days and b when the optimal conditions for rust cease before the peak is reached creating a maximum at 300 days the variations of the time to mati and mati for all the combinations of scenarios fall within the range reviewed in section 3 1 see fig 2 and tables s1 1 and s1 2 in all the spatial arrangements when diffusion rate increases mati increases and days to mati decrease fig 4 in the aggregated planting arrangement mati is always reached before 300 days ranging from 116 to 287 days and has values above 70 of infected leaves only slightly modified by the diffusion rate in the rows random and spaced arrangement the change of diffusion rate has a more pronounced effect on the mati when the diffusion rate is minimal log m 3 the time to mati is 300 days case b figs 4 and 5 in those scenarios mati reaches values that range between 35 and 55 of infected leaves depending on how advanced the infection was at 300 days if the diffusion rate is larger more than 2 5 or 2 depending on the arrangement and the initial infection the time to mati becomes less than 300 days for these three arrangements varying between 151 and 294 days in these scenarios an infection peak is reached before the end of optimal conditions i e before the end of the simulation case a in other terms for lower values of diffusion rate log m 3 the change of the diffusion rate affects the mati according to a critical distance between plants h when h is higher than 1 5 this change greatly modifies the mati figs 4 and s1 4 when h is lower than this threshold the mati is slightly affected for higher values of the diffusion rate log m 3 the differences in aggregation become less relevant interestingly in all scenarios the diffusion rate modifies the growth time per se that varies between 151 and 205 for log m 3 and 89 and 129 for log m 1 see fig 4 and table s1 2 for low diffusion rates this results in flatter curves leading to lower mati fig 5 moreover differences in planting arrangements do modify the qualitative average tree infection dynamics creating smoother or rougher curves fig 5 in particular the spaced arrangement combined with a low diffusion rate generates multiple steps in the epidemiological dynamics fig 5 this is similar to what we observe in fig 2b or h random and row planting arrangements did not present any relevant differences between them i0 mainly affects the time lag that varies between 70 and 150 days when i0 0 001 and between 22 and 113 days when i0 0 1 see fig 4 and table s1 2 the curves of fig 5 are thus shifted along the time axis as i0 varies it is noteworthy that the time lag can be higher than in the one plant simulation scenarios that go from 10 to 50 days as i0 is varied this increase in the time lag can lead to a lower mati if the curve of infection does not reach a maximum peak and is still increasing at the end of the simulation figs 4 and 5 all of our results were qualitatively robust to the variation of the other plant level parameters within their estimated range except for the lowest value of α α 0 1 that significantly decreases the mati in all scenarios fig s1 7 finally as in the plant level simulation the mati decreases and the time to mati increases when the infected leaf fall rate γ increases fig s1 7 b especially for values greater than the estimated range γ 0 056 3 5 the mati and time to mati are determined by the number of individual plants that reach a high level of infection before the end of the simulation and their degree of temporal overlapping the level of infection of individual trees and their degree of temporal overlapping determine the average infection dynamics both variables are affected by the diffusion rate and the planting arrangement we represent in fig 6 the proportion of trees that reached a high level of infection 70 of infected leaves during the same 15 day period and the accumulated proportion of corresponding highly infected trees dotted line which indicates how much the epidemic has expanded in space up to a given time see supplementary material s4 for a full plot visualisation and refer to fig s1 5 for the values of each tree s maximum infection and timing planting arrangement substantially influences the overlap between individual tree dynamics this explains the different shapes of the average infection curves fig 5 as well as the changes in mati and time to mati when plants are spaced in rows or randomly distributed the distribution of the number of highly infected trees over time is broader than in the aggregated pattern especially when diffusion is high fig 6 yellow and light blue bars this means that in the first three scenarios the temporal overlap of highly infected trees decreases which causes a lower mati compared to the aggregated pattern figs 4 and 6 the diffusion rate combined with the planting pattern affects both the overlap and the individual times at which the maximum individual infection is reached when diffusion is low dark blue vs light blue and orange vs yellow bars in fig 6 the distribution is spread out and slightly shifted to the right see also the accumulated curve at low diffusion for the spaced rows and random patterns only 50 to 75 of the trees reach the 70 of infected leaves threshold before the end of the simulation the other trees with low levels of infection will contribute little to the average tree infection value lowering the mati figs 4 5 and s1 5 in the aggregated pattern or when diffusion is high all the trees reach 70 of infected leaves the accumulated curves sum up to 1 interestingly high values of h which characterises rows random and spaced arrangements combined with a low diffusion rate dark and orange bars generate isolated outbreaks of highly infected trees fig 6 in particular in the spaced pattern individual trees reach high infections at well separated times explaining the multi stepped dynamics of the spatially averaged prevalence in fig 5 fig 6 also shows that a lower amount of initially infected leaves i0 delays the initial infection without significantly changing the dynamics 4 discussion one of the central issues in coffee rust epidemiology is to understand the factors that explain the great variability in the magnitude of the infection peaks and their timing both at the plant and plot levels avelino et al 1991 li et al 2022 rosas et al 2021 to address this issue many studies have focused on the microclimate avelino et al 2006 plant resistance talhinhas et al 2017 or the susceptibility of leaves during specific stages of the coffee crop cycle salgado et al 2008 nevertheless none of these approaches has succeeded to fully explain the differences in timing and intensity of the epidemics occurring in plots from the same site with equivalent meteorological and plant genetic conditions here we hypothesised that spatial patterns created by rust dispersal in different planting arrangements might be affecting both variables we first documented known trends for the timing and magnitude of the epidemic peak as well as their variability by comparing epidemiological curves from different sites fig 2 from this analysis we distinguish two phases in the epidemic timeline a time lag and a growth phase per se fig 2 and table s1 1 we also noted that the harvesting period correlated with the build up or growth phase fig 2a c g i this is consistent with harvesting and rust infection being related to fruit development and fruit load avelino et al 1993 motisi et al 2022 salgado et al 2008 nevertheless the movements of workers during harvesting might also promote rust dispersal and reinforce the infection motisi et al 2022 our parameterised six model recreates the coffee rust epidemic and helps us to explore some of the mechanisms that may determine properties of the maximum peak and its timing figs 3 6 the values of the maximum average tree infection mati and time to mati were within the range reported in field studies this qualitatively validates the estimates of the model parameters and supports that different planting arrangements and different diffusion rates might provide possible explanations to the variation observed in real dynamics in particular we showed that both the planting arrangement and the diffusion rate jointly modify the mati and time to mati by preventing some plants from reaching their maximum peak figs 4 6 thus explaining part of the variability observed in plots with otherwise similar conditions in particular the aggregated spatial arrangement highly increases the mati compared to the other planting arrangements that did not present quantitative differences between them see video in supplementary material s4 the effects of the planting arrangement are noticeable in the different curves of fig 5 which can be multi stepped or smooth like some of the curves from real data presented in fig 2 the multi stepped pattern is associated with a higher distance between plants in particular in the spaced pattern where plants have no direct neighbours in this sense the differences of the effect of planting patterns on the mati and curves of infection were more related with a planting aggregation threshold or a minimal distance between plants than with the spatial arrangements per se moreover a low i0 increases the time it takes to reach the maximum peak of infection at the plant level and plot level due to delays in the start of the growth phase figs 4 and 5 the time lag differences reported in sites with similar phenological timing li et al 2022 can thus be explained by differences in the initial infection and planting arrangements and not only by the positive correlation between fruit charge and plant susceptibility to infection avelino et al 1993 salgado et al 2008 finally we found that high infected leaf fall rate ɣ strongly affects the whole plot infection dynamics and we hypothesise that this quantity is a key aspect for coffee rust monitoring or intervention at the plot scale park et al 2001 these results have a practical significance regarding coffee rust management they highlight the importance of reducing rust dispersal rates either by having other trees in the plot or by planting coffee plants at larger distances independently of the spatial arrangement per se in order to uncouple individual dynamics and reduce plot infection in particular one should avoid the aggregated arrangement this is h values larger than 1 5 fig s1 4 video s4 this result complements those of hajian forooshani and vandermeer 2021 who tested different critical dispersal distances between coffee plants and reported that the regularity of the planting arrangement pattern modulates the time to reach fully rust infected coffee plots this is relevant for farmers who balance their planting density according to their production necessities and the risk of plot epidemic ehrenbergerová et al 2018 in general conventional coffee management produces very densely aggregated planting patterns that might be prone to coffee leaf rust invasion contrarily to more rustic or ecological coffee plantations that intercalate different kinds of trees between the coffee plants moguel and toledo 1999 besides boudrot et al 2016 and gagliardi et al 2020 reported that the functional traits of plants related to shade foliage density shade percentage modify the relative importance of wind and rainfall in uredospore dispersal across the plot understanding the role of the initial infection and dispersal rate on the time lag is also relevant for rust control procedures that rely heavily on the timing of the epidemic such as pruning management of shade boudrot et al 2016 liebig et al 2019 soto pinto et al 2000 or fungicide application burdekin 1964 mulinge and griffiths 1974 additionally the leaf fall rate of infected leaves can also be modified with management practices but may have an ambiguous effect on the maximum infection on the one hand farmers could decrease the maximum infection by removing and bagging away the infected leaves continuously thus decreasing the source of new reinfections from infected leaves either on the ground or in the plant system but on the other hand due to the farmers movement between the trees removing the leaves could trigger the dispersal of uredospores by contact and further propagate the epidemic the present model also allows us to make recommendations on the ways coffee rust prevalence can be measured and monitored here we worked with the average tree infection because it is one of the more common ways of measuring coffee rust prevalence in coffee plots fig 2 nevertheless this variable is highly dependent on the progression of the infection in the chosen plants and their degree of temporal overlap due to spatial factors fig 6 additionally the average over trees can be an inappropriate measure for the plot infection when individual infections follow a non normal distribution that changes during the epidemic even if we supposed the infection to follow a normal distribution the mean without the variance would not be sufficient other ways of measuring plot infection in the field could consist in drawing spatially explicit plot infection maps li et al 2022 rosas et al 2021 vandermeer et al 2018 in our model we considered rust dispersal from one plant to its four closest neighbours through splash and leaf to leaf contact this assumption was linked to the spatial arrangements that were only significantly different in the 4 neighbour vicinity however in future work it will be important to consider other mechanisms and models for spore dispersal that consider an 8 neighbour range or long range dispersal on the one hand it is known that changing the neighbourhood of interaction can change the probability of plot invasion park et al 2001 also having a different dispersal rate depending on whether the plants are in contact or not can lead to critical transitions in infection dynamics hajian forooshani and vandermeer 2021 vandermeer et al 2018 on the other hand if we were to consider other dispersal mechanisms such as wind gusts or human action during harvesting becker and kranz 1977 the planting arrangements might play a less important role in plot infection this is because spores would reach farther trees and attenuate the relevance of the plot geometry in those scenarios the amount of shade trees that can act as wind barriers would be crucial to reduce dispersal gagliardi et al 2020 and uncouple the individual tree infection dynamics moreover the model considers only one initially infected tree located in the centre of the plot other choices should not qualitatively change our results but might have an effect on the general times of infection the effect of multiple sources of infection should also be studied in future works it is also important to keep in mind that our model assumes that infected fallen leaves are removed from the system bagged away for example and cannot spread infection to neighbouring plants or reinfect in many sites these fallen leaves with spores likely contribute in a meaningful way to infecting plants zachary hajian forooshani personal obs this could be added in the future by defining an additional r compartment in the six equation nevertheless as coffee leaf rust is a biotroph the survival of spores in the fallen leaves is expected to be limited weather covariates like high rainfalls might also influence plant level parameters such as the recruitment of spores from infected leaves α by washing off spores from the leaves this is likely to strongly affect the general dynamics of infection e g reducing the maximum infection figs 2 and s1 7 motisi et al 2022 and should be considered in future works finally our model represents coffee rust infection but does not assess coffee production reduction this relationship is not necessarily linear and must be considered for any practical recommendations cerda et al 2017 control and management practices of coffee rust disease have commonly underestimated the role of dispersal and the relationship between plant and plot dynamics our work contributes to a better understanding of this relationship and can be used as a null model to study the role of specific dispersal mechanisms such as wind splash or human mobility see for example avelino et al 2012 becker and kranz 1977 gagliardi et al 2020 hajian forooshani and vandermeer 2021 it mostly aimed at exploring the general and qualitative mechanisms behind the patterns observed in real systems fig 2 adding context specific conditions would enable us to do some data fitting and quantitative comparisons in a more detailed way than the general times of mati and time to mati presented here recreating and understanding the main mechanisms of coffee rust dispersal is crucial to the development of a preventive approach to epidemics it informs the management processes that seek to balance the different effects that some practices have on the infection and dispersal stages in order to design resilient agroecological coffee systems to coffee rust or other

24310,one central issue in coffee leaf rust hemileia vastatrix epidemiology is to understand what determines the intensity and the timing of yearly infections in coffee plantations however most experimental and theoretical studies report infection as an average at the plot level obscuring the role of potentially key factors like rust dispersal or the planting pattern here we first review the rust epidemic patterns of different sites which reveal large variability in the duration and magnitude of the different epidemiologic phases we then present a spatially explicit and parametrised model where the host population is subdivided into discrete patches linked through spore dispersal modeled as simple diffusion with this model we study the role of the planting arrangement the dispersal intensity and plant level variables on the maximum average tree infection mati and its timing our results suggest that the epidemic timeline can be divided into two phases a time lag and a growth phase per se the model shows that the combination of the dispersal magnitude and plant aggregation modifies the mati and the time to mati mainly by preventing some plants from reaching their maximum peak during the epidemic it also affects the epidemic curves which can have a stepped or a rather smooth pattern in plots with otherwise similar conditions the initial rust infection modulates the time lag before the epidemic and the infected leaf fall rate drastically changes the mati these findings highlight the importance of explicitly considering the spatial aspects of coffee agroecosystems when measuring and managing rust infection and help us to further understand the spatio temporal dynamics of ecological systems in general keywords coffee leaf rust infection dispersal epidemiology dynamical modeling data availability all code and data to reproduce results in the work can be accessed at https github com tenayuco dispersion plant arrangement coffeerust infection 1 introduction the first recorded epidemic of the coffee rust disease caused by the fungus hemileia vastatrix broke out in ceylon now sri lanka in 1869 talhinhas et al 2017 since then coffee rust has spread across the continents reaching virtually all the coffee plantations areas on earth avelino et al 2006 mccook and vandermeer 2015 this is particularly relevant for farmers who depend economically on these crops one central issue in coffee rust epidemiology is to understand what determines the intensity of a one year infection avelino et al 2006 gagliardi et al 2020 kushalappa and eskes 1989 motisi et al 2022 similarly many epidemiologists have sought to estimate the time to maximum infection for the design of specific control practices ananth 1969 burdekin 1964 both questions have been studied within the disease triangle framework stevens 1960 in this sense scientists and farmers have studied the pathogen s properties such as its genetics carvalho et al 2011 the host resistance and phenology avelino et al 1993 silva et al 2006 and disease environmental drivers such as the temperature humidity or precipitation avelino et al 2015 nevertheless there is a large amount of variability in the intensity and timing of the different epidemiological phases of the coffee rust epidemic that remains unexplained even between neighbouring coffee plots with the same environmental and biotic conditions li et al 2022 for example in some plantations when the abiotic and biotic conditions for rust invasion are met the infection may not start right away there is a highly variable time lag boudrot et al 2016 mulinge and griffiths 1974 to explain this variability previous research has mainly focused on the infection phase per se where susceptible leaves are infected by coffee rust spores and become infective talhinhas et al 2017 and has overlooked another epidemiological phase dispersal dispersal is the process by which spores are transported from one place to another across different scales ranging from the intraleaf interleaf or even the interplot scale becker and kranz 1977 boudrot et al 2016 vandermeer et al 2018 overall the intensity of an epidemic is highly related to the rates of infection and dispersal during each season avelino et al 2015 analysis of dispersal is thus called for and by its very nature must incorporate a spatial approach avelino et al 2012 there are effectively two distinct scales of dispersal first the large scale mediated by the wind and resulting from a rain of spores over large areas between plots or between farms becker and kranz 1977 bowden et al 1971 kushalappa and eskes 1989 and second the local scale corresponding to neighbouring plants in a plot and or leaves on the same plant caused mainly by insect vectors splash wind gusts and human action during harvest becker and kranz 1977 vandermeer et al 2018 in this work we will focus on the local plant to plant dispersal scale in a plot intuitively higher local dispersal should lead to more severe epidemics in a plot however despite the importance of a nuanced understanding of rust epidemic dynamics within plots most empirical studies on coffee rust epidemics report rust prevalence in terms of averages within a plot and not on individual trees bock 1962a burdekin 1964 this method reduces the sampling errors and smooths the epidemic curves but may obscure the relationship between plant and plot dynamics mediated by dispersal besides coffee plantations can be arranged in rows or follow a more random arrangement depending on the age type rustic or conventional or size of the plantation hajian forooshani and vandermeer 2021 moguel and toledo 1999 therefore coffee rust dispersal effect might be modulated by these planting patterns hajian forooshani and vandermeer 2021 vandermeer et al 2018 finally the relative importance of the dispersal between plants and the plant level infection dynamics such as the initial infection or the rust infected leaf fall rate on the plot level rust epidemics has not been fully assessed or considered in current dynamic models but see park et al 2001 a dynamical modeling approach at both the plant and plot scales can help to disentangle such multi scaled relations and processes and shed light on the role of dispersal on the maximum infection prevalence we will refer here to maximum infection and the time to reach it in coffee plantations we hypothesise that spatial dynamics and coffee rust dispersal might also play a role in the variability of the timing and magnitude of the different rust epidemiological phases in coffee plots with otherwise similar biotic and abiotic conditions we thus seek to explore the determinants of a the plot averaged maximum infection and b its timing using a parametrised epidemiological six susceptible infected external inoculum model in a spatially structured host population with this model we analyze the role of the intensity of rust dispersal planting arrangements initial infection and plant level dynamics such as the fall rate of an infected leaf on the epidemiological outcomes 2 methods we first reviewed quantitative and qualitative data on the maximum infection and the number of days to reach this maximum in different coffee systems from these data we estimated the duration of the different coffee rust epidemiological phases and their variability and used them for future validation of the model secondly we built a spatially explicit model to study the role of planting arrangement dispersal intensity plant level dynamics and initial conditions on the variability detected in the spatially averaged maximum coffee rust infection and its timing details are presented below but the overall work route was the following we first constructed the model and parametrised it then we implemented different computational scenarios at the plant and plot level and studied their effect on the maximum infection growth phase and time lags 2 1 reviewing the qualitative dynamics of coffee rust infection to study the qualitative behavior of coffee rust infections we reviewed literature reporting data on coffee rust at coffee sites with different climatic orographic and management conditions we used data from studies that presented at least a 12 month time series rainfall pattern and in some cases the harvesting period we explored publications reporting all these data from the 1960 s to the present since most of the reviewed works do not report tables or do not follow a uniform procedure we extracted both the rainfall and coffee rust infection data directly from the graphs using webplotdigitizer drevon et al 2017 rohatgi 2020 we transformed all dates to their corresponding julian day number and all the precipitation histograms to millimetres some graphs started on day 250 september 7th and others on day 1 january 1st fig 2 we considered three time series from chiapas méxico avelino et al 1991 vandermeer et al 2018 two from central america quetzaltenango guatemala and turrialaba costa rica avelino et al 1993 boudrot et al 2016 one from south india mysore ananth 1969 and three from kenya east riff ruiru and kiambu becker and kranz 1977 bock 1962a mulinge and griffiths 1974 in the case of ruiru kenya rainfall was not directly reported so we used the rainfall pattern reported for nairobi which has similar climatic conditions ndolo et al 2017 in some cases coffee rust infection was reported as the average percentage of rust infected leaves per tree in others as spores counted per tree or spores in the immediate vicinity rainfall was reported on a daily or monthly basis and we grouped the daily data in months when the harvesting period was reported we added it manually adding a ten day error to each end for each site we reviewed the duration of the different epidemiological phases the maximum infection reached and their relationship with rainfall and harvesting period we defined the beginning of the rainy season as the middle of the first month that averaged precipitations higher than 50 mm and the beginning of the epidemic growth period per se as the moment when the increase in the reported percentage of infected leaves in the trees was higher than 0 1 per day the time between these two points was defined as the time lag other characteristics of the plantations such as the climatic orographic and management conditions are included in the supplementary material s2 the general timings and magnitudes of infection on these sites were also compared to the predictions of our parametrised model 2 2 six model construction we modeled the dynamics of multiple individual plants including both infection and internal leaf to leaf spore dispersal processes coupled in a plot through a plant to plant dispersal mechanism the overall modeling strategy is shown in fig 1 and can be summarised as follows we first defined a 10 10 lattice 100 cells with sink boundaries and 50 trees n in four different scenarios of planting arrangements aggregated random rows and spaced fig 1b these arrangements aim to represent the different patterns reported in coffee plots where trees can be closely surrounded by other trees aggregated or have direct neighbours in one specific direction rows or have no direct neighbours spaced or have a random arrangement black squares represent the trees with susceptible or infected leaves as well as the immediate space around the tree where external uredospores may be present white squares represent regions of space where only uredospores might be present s i 0 in eq 2 2 fig 1b we characterised the four different planting arrangements with a distance between plant index h defined as eq 2 1 2 1 h n i 1 n h i h i j 1 4 1 d ji 4 where n is the number of plants per plot and hi is the average of the inverse distance number of squares between plant i and its four closest neighbours j dji along the horizontal and vertical axis if there are no neighbours along a particular direction we set 1 dji 0 in the case of the random arrangement we ran 30 configurations and presented the average since we chose the same number of trees for all the scenarios n 50 h only depends on the spatial arrangement of plants fig 1b each tree follows the two main phases of the coffee rust life cycle host pathogen interaction invasion and pathogen dispersal whose dynamics are schematized in fig 1a and are described by the following system of coupled differential equations eq 2 2 2 2 d s i dt ρ k s i β 1 x i s i k β 2 i i s i k d i i dt β 1 x i s i k β 2 i i s i k γ i i d x i dt α i i μ x i m j 1 v i x ji v i x i where si and ii are the amounts of susceptible and infected leaves in tree i ii represents the state where the infected leaf has already produced new infective spores xi represents the number of infective external uredospores from now on external spores supplementary material s3 bock 1962b in square i with or without a tree xi does not include spores in the leaves or between them only the ones that are outside the tree host reproduction i e leaf production and leaf fall rate of susceptible leaves is represented by the so called monomolecular growth cunniffe and gilligan 2010 where the natural or non infected leaf fall rate is represented by ρ and leaf production rate is equivalent to kρ where k is the carrying capacity of susceptible leaves we took k 1 for simplicity but our results can be rescaled by using reported values for k burdekin 1964 this assumes that the new leaf production rate equals the leaf fall rate of susceptible leaves the transition from s to i is subdivided into primary infection arising from the external spores x and secondary infection occurring by transmission from already infected leaves i in both cases the growth in infection is proportional to the fraction of remaining susceptible leaves s k and to the rates β1 β2 respectively infected leaves can fall and leave the i compartment at a rate ɣ that must be higher than the non infected leaf fall rate ρ spores detach from infected leaves and become suspended in the air or fall on the ground filling the x compartment at a rate α external spores die at rate μ both in squares with and without trees black and white cells in fig 1b finally m is the diffusion rate which represents the rate at which spores are dispersed to the neighbouring squares let us denote as vi the number of immediate neighbours of square i ranging from two to four depending on the location of the square in the lattice and xji the amount of x in the j th neighbour of i non directed dispersal is modeled by a diffusion process that takes place from one plant to its four immediate neighbouring squares mimicking short ranged rust dispersal mediated by splash and plant to plant contact in our two directional planting arrangements note that equivalent scenarios could be modeled using an 8 neighbourhood vicinity but in order to create the spaced arrangement we would have to push trees further away from each other in empty squares si ii 0 so the spores have the following dynamic d x i dt m j 1 v i x ji v i x i all the parameters are summarised in table 1 our model is a spatially extended case of the sirx susceptible infected removed external inoculum models analyzed by cunniffe and gilligan 2010 and gubbins et al 2000 originally developed for insect pathogen interactions but widely used for plant pathogen associations swinton and anderson 1995 here we did not include the removed compartment r since its dynamic is determined by the other compartments and does not impact the whole infection process this assumption is discussed in the discussion section in this sense our model can be referred to as a six model we assume that infection happens in non resistant coffee trees with well mixed leaves when the conditions for the development of coffee rust are optimal sufficient susceptible leaves and humidity nutman et al 1963 factors like plant or rust variability are not explicitly considered nor the change in abiotic conditions in this work we do not study the equilibrium points but rather some of the most relevant transient dynamics of coffee rust epidemics like the duration of the growth phase or the maximum infection as well as the probability of rust invasion in each individual plant but see cunniffe and gilligan 2010 for the linear analysis of the model and the supplementary material s1 for the equilibrium points the invasion criteria is summarised by the parameter r0 which is defined as eq 2 3 2 3 r 0 β 2 β 1 α μ γ if r0 is less than 1 the single plant system always reaches a non infective equilibrium if r0 1 i and x invade and s decreases see fig s1 1 and cunniffe and gilligan 2010 for the main mathematical results on this model 2 3 plant level parameterization and simulation conditions we selected the infected leaf fall rate ɣ as the sole plant level variable and fixed the other parameters of the six equation primary and secondary infection recruitment leaf growth and spore death rates we chose the infected leaf fall rate as it is a variable that can be directly modified by human management e g removing and bagging away the infected leaves the other parameters such as the infection rates are affected by multiple environmental genetic and management processes and are more difficult to control besides this decision reduces our computational explorations and simplifies the interpretation of the results to choose the values of the plant level parameters correctly and work with meaningful timescales we estimated the range of each plant or spore parameter from reported data table 1 bock 1962a boudrot et al 2016 deepak et al 2012 firman and wallis 1965 gagliardi et al 2020 leguizamón caycedo et al 1998 mulinge and griffiths 1974 nutman et al 1963 rakocevic and takeshi matsunaga 2018 rayner 1961 silva acuña et al 1999 we then set each parameter to the mean value for our general simulations but we included a sensitivity analysis of our results using the lowest and highest values of the estimated ranges the infected leaf fall rate ɣ was varied above its estimated mean to account for leaf removal practices that shorten the time for a rusted leaf to fall e g selective pruning but we restricted its maximum value to simulate scenarios where rust invades the system this is where r0 1 considering the other estimated parameters eq 2 3 the detailed methods for the estimation of each parameter are available in the supplementary material s3 to summarise the model parameters can be estimated from the characteristic time scale in days of a given known process we first looked for studies that reported those times directly or indirectly if these data were not available we fitted specific time series of leaf infection to linear or exponential models table 1 2 4 simulations and measured variables mati and time to mati with the chosen parameters we explored the effect of the leaf fall rate of infected leaves ɣ the initial proportion of infected leaves per tree i0 the planting patterns and the different plant to plant diffusion rates m on the maximum averaged tree infection henceforth mati and the time to reach this maximum in days fig 1c the mati is obtained by averaging tree infection over all trees in the plot for every time step and then by identifying its overall maximum this is a common indicator to measure rust infections in the field the time to mati was divided into a time lag and a growth period per se following the same criteria used in real time series see section 2 1 and fig 1c the results were then compared with the magnitudes measured in section 2 1 and analyzed in each combination of scenarios 2 4 1 one plant level simulations we first ran simulations of the six model at the single tree level n 1 m 0 and i 1 studying the effect of both the ɣ and i0 on the mati and the time to mati in this scenario the mati is the maximum local tree infection we varied the leaf fall rate of infected leaves ɣ from 0 015 to 0 14 and the initial proportion of infected leaves per tree i0 from 0 001 to 0 1 72 scenarios in total each simulation started with i0 infected leaves i i0 1 i0 susceptible leaves s 1 i0 no external uredospores x 0 and ran for 30 000 integration steps using the euler method δt 0 01 this method is a standard and common integration procedure for solving discretized partial differential equations in lattices koch and meinhardt 1994 elder et al 1992 and is sufficiently robust and precise for all our modeled scenarios and quantities of interest with a δt 0 02 there were no differences in the results within the range of precision used fig s1 6 these integration steps represented 300 days after parameter calibration the beginning of the simulation corresponds to the start of the optimal conditions for infection when humidity is sufficient and leaves are susceptible and we chose 300 days to be the maximum time for the rust to reach the maximum peak of infection in one year following the times reported in fig 2 after this rust infection is assumed to decrease this time limit sets a maximum simulation time 2 4 2 plot level simulations the next step was to run the full model in the 10 10 lattice to include the effects of spatial arrangement and diffusion rate on the mati and time to mati we defined scenarios with the four different planting arrangements aggregated spaced random and rows one initially infected tree in the centre of the lattice x y 5 6 two values of initially infected leaves i0 0 001 and i0 0 1 and five different levels of diffusion rate m across three orders of magnitude ranging from 0 001 to 0 1 or expressed in log for a better visualisation from 3 to 1 we also chose two of the values of γ used in the single plant dynamic 0 015 0 056 to compare the plant and plot level results for the random planting we took averages over 30 simulations for each combination of the parameters for each scenario we obtained the mati and the time to mati as a function of the diffusion rate initial infection and h we also included the time evolution of the average tree infection with two representative diffusion values log m 3 log m 2 as we consider t 300 days the results of the scenarios can be divided into two cases a when an infection peak is attained before the 300 days and b when the optimal conditions for rust cease before the peak is reached creating a maximum at 300 days finally in order to explore the relationship between individual and average dynamics we registered the values of each tree s maximum infection and timing and grouped the number of trees that reached a high level of infection more than 70 of infected leaves during the same 15 day period focusing both on the level of infection of individual trees and their degree of temporal overlapping can shed light on the determinants of the average infection dynamics 2 4 3 computational implementation the model and simulations were implemented in the python 3 7 3 programming language using the modules numpy scipy pandas seaborn and ran on the lancis facilities at the ecology institute of unam the data analyzes and figures were done in rstudio 1 2 1335 using plyr dplyr tidyverse ggplot2 and patchwork libraries and inkscape 1 0 all code and data to reproduce results in the work can be accessed at https github com tenayuco dispersion plant arrangement coffeerust infection 3 results 3 1 trends in qualitative dynamics coffee rust infection seasonality and variability in time lags growth phase and maximum infection fig 2 depicts different coffee rust infection dynamics observed in nine sites the corresponding rainfall and when reported the harvesting period each infection is measured either as the average percentage of rusted leaves per tree or as the average number of spores during at least one year green bar at the bottom of each plot plotting the time series together enables us to visualise similarities and differences firstly rust infection follows a basic epidemiological cycle consisting of a time lag in relation to the beginning of the rainy season followed by a growth and a decline phase coffee rust infection also seems to have a rain forced periodicity the growth phase always starts after the onset of the rain season this is clearer for fig 2a c where more than one year is reported this forced periodicity is related to the first phases of the coffee rust infection cycle where rain is necessary for spores liberation and invasion the infection reaches a maximum value and declines when the rain season is ongoing d h or has ended a c f g in kenya where there are two rainy seasons per year we observe two peaks of infection fig 2b e h the second peaks are substantially lower than the first peaks in east riff and ruiru sites but they are qualitatively relevant to the general dynamics b h as they show that a new infection process began the time lag is 82 days on average ranging from 24 5 b to 146 days c see table s1 1 in sites with two rainy seasons the lag shortens fig 2b e h in some cases coffee rust infection is negligible during the lag fig 2c d f g the growth phase takes 119 days on average ranging from 68 i to 181 days c table s1 1 it is worth noting that the coffee rust infection cycle takes about 30 days therefore rust probably undergoes multiple infection cycles during one epidemiological phase as discussed in kushalappa and eskes 1989 the time to maximum infection comprises the time lag and the growth phase and ranges from 95 i to 325 days c the maximum average tree infection ranges in turn from 20 to 80 of infected leaves per tree therefore the timing and intensity of an infection at a given site are largely variable interestingly the harvesting period correlates with the build up growth phase fig 2a c g i see the discussion section all values for the mati and time to mati are summarised in table s1 1 3 2 estimation of the parameters of the six model in a rust infected scenario we estimated the natural non infected leaf fall time primary and secondary infection and spore death rates directly from reported data supplementary material s3 table 1 the leaf fall time of susceptible leaves 1 ρ ranges between 74 and 108 days β1 and β2 can both be interpreted as the inverse of the time taken for one susceptible leaf to become infected either for being in contact with external spores or with an infected leaf if we assume that one package of external spores infects one leaf at a time this is nsp ninf 1 both times are equal and range from 25 to 30 days 1 β1 and 1 β2 finally the uredospore viability goes from 3 to 10 days 1 μ table 1 the time taken for a newly infected leaf to fall 1 ɣ was estimated indirectly as how much shorter this time was in comparison to 1 ρ infected leaves take on average from 35 to 53 days less than susceptible leaves to fall we express ɣ as ρ ρi where ρi is the increment in leaf fall rate due to coffee rust infection the recruitment rate α range is broad 0 1 1 2 since it was estimated indirectly from several studies table 1 we use ρ 0 011 hence the mean value of ɣ is equal to 0 015 table 1 given the values chosen for the other parameters here the invasion criterion can be expressed as r0 0 15 ɣ 1 see eq 2 3 and fig s1 1 in this sense to simulate rust infected scenarios and to account for leaf removal practices see section 2 3 ɣ was varied between 0 015 to 0 14 r0 1 10 3 3 in one plant simulations ɣ affects both the mati and time to mati and i0 affects the time to mati through the time lag fig 3 a b display the maximum averaged tree infection mati and the days to mati for one tree simulations n 1 varying the leaf fall rate ɣ and initial proportion of infected leaves i0 mati decreases with the infected leaf fall rate fig 3a c when ɣ is equal 0 015 the maximum infection is around 75 when ɣ is higher than 0 1 mati drops to zero this effect is independent of the number of infected leaves in the systems equilibria predicted by r0 section 2 3 fig s1 3 see fig s1 1 for the influence of ɣ on equilibria and stability i0 does not affect the mati whatsoever fig 3d time to mati is affected by both ɣ fig 3b c and i0 fig 3b d in general when ɣ increases the time to reach mati increases because the curve flattens fig 3c affecting the growth phase duration but not necessarily the time lag see fig 2 on the other hand when i0 is low the time to mati increases without changing the mati fig 3b d in other terms i0 affects the time lag but not the growth phase per se fig 3d when mati drops to 0 with high values of ɣ the time to mati is not relevant since the maximum infection can be reached at the beginning of the simulation 3 4 in the spatially explicit model diffusion rate and the planting arrangement jointly modify mati and days to mati in a threshold dependent manner and modify the curves of infection while i0 modulates the time lag and γ decreases the mati in all scenarios we plotted in fig 4 the mati and time to mati for each combination of planting arrangement diffusion and initial conditions i0 and in fig 5 the time evolution of the average tree infection with two representative diffusion values log m 3 log m 2 we used two values of γ 0 015 0 056 but as the results were qualitatively similar we only present the plots here for γ 0 015 but see fig s1 7 for the case of γ 0 056 as we explained in the methods sections results are divided into two cases a when an infection peak is attained before the 300 days and b when the optimal conditions for rust cease before the peak is reached creating a maximum at 300 days the variations of the time to mati and mati for all the combinations of scenarios fall within the range reviewed in section 3 1 see fig 2 and tables s1 1 and s1 2 in all the spatial arrangements when diffusion rate increases mati increases and days to mati decrease fig 4 in the aggregated planting arrangement mati is always reached before 300 days ranging from 116 to 287 days and has values above 70 of infected leaves only slightly modified by the diffusion rate in the rows random and spaced arrangement the change of diffusion rate has a more pronounced effect on the mati when the diffusion rate is minimal log m 3 the time to mati is 300 days case b figs 4 and 5 in those scenarios mati reaches values that range between 35 and 55 of infected leaves depending on how advanced the infection was at 300 days if the diffusion rate is larger more than 2 5 or 2 depending on the arrangement and the initial infection the time to mati becomes less than 300 days for these three arrangements varying between 151 and 294 days in these scenarios an infection peak is reached before the end of optimal conditions i e before the end of the simulation case a in other terms for lower values of diffusion rate log m 3 the change of the diffusion rate affects the mati according to a critical distance between plants h when h is higher than 1 5 this change greatly modifies the mati figs 4 and s1 4 when h is lower than this threshold the mati is slightly affected for higher values of the diffusion rate log m 3 the differences in aggregation become less relevant interestingly in all scenarios the diffusion rate modifies the growth time per se that varies between 151 and 205 for log m 3 and 89 and 129 for log m 1 see fig 4 and table s1 2 for low diffusion rates this results in flatter curves leading to lower mati fig 5 moreover differences in planting arrangements do modify the qualitative average tree infection dynamics creating smoother or rougher curves fig 5 in particular the spaced arrangement combined with a low diffusion rate generates multiple steps in the epidemiological dynamics fig 5 this is similar to what we observe in fig 2b or h random and row planting arrangements did not present any relevant differences between them i0 mainly affects the time lag that varies between 70 and 150 days when i0 0 001 and between 22 and 113 days when i0 0 1 see fig 4 and table s1 2 the curves of fig 5 are thus shifted along the time axis as i0 varies it is noteworthy that the time lag can be higher than in the one plant simulation scenarios that go from 10 to 50 days as i0 is varied this increase in the time lag can lead to a lower mati if the curve of infection does not reach a maximum peak and is still increasing at the end of the simulation figs 4 and 5 all of our results were qualitatively robust to the variation of the other plant level parameters within their estimated range except for the lowest value of α α 0 1 that significantly decreases the mati in all scenarios fig s1 7 finally as in the plant level simulation the mati decreases and the time to mati increases when the infected leaf fall rate γ increases fig s1 7 b especially for values greater than the estimated range γ 0 056 3 5 the mati and time to mati are determined by the number of individual plants that reach a high level of infection before the end of the simulation and their degree of temporal overlapping the level of infection of individual trees and their degree of temporal overlapping determine the average infection dynamics both variables are affected by the diffusion rate and the planting arrangement we represent in fig 6 the proportion of trees that reached a high level of infection 70 of infected leaves during the same 15 day period and the accumulated proportion of corresponding highly infected trees dotted line which indicates how much the epidemic has expanded in space up to a given time see supplementary material s4 for a full plot visualisation and refer to fig s1 5 for the values of each tree s maximum infection and timing planting arrangement substantially influences the overlap between individual tree dynamics this explains the different shapes of the average infection curves fig 5 as well as the changes in mati and time to mati when plants are spaced in rows or randomly distributed the distribution of the number of highly infected trees over time is broader than in the aggregated pattern especially when diffusion is high fig 6 yellow and light blue bars this means that in the first three scenarios the temporal overlap of highly infected trees decreases which causes a lower mati compared to the aggregated pattern figs 4 and 6 the diffusion rate combined with the planting pattern affects both the overlap and the individual times at which the maximum individual infection is reached when diffusion is low dark blue vs light blue and orange vs yellow bars in fig 6 the distribution is spread out and slightly shifted to the right see also the accumulated curve at low diffusion for the spaced rows and random patterns only 50 to 75 of the trees reach the 70 of infected leaves threshold before the end of the simulation the other trees with low levels of infection will contribute little to the average tree infection value lowering the mati figs 4 5 and s1 5 in the aggregated pattern or when diffusion is high all the trees reach 70 of infected leaves the accumulated curves sum up to 1 interestingly high values of h which characterises rows random and spaced arrangements combined with a low diffusion rate dark and orange bars generate isolated outbreaks of highly infected trees fig 6 in particular in the spaced pattern individual trees reach high infections at well separated times explaining the multi stepped dynamics of the spatially averaged prevalence in fig 5 fig 6 also shows that a lower amount of initially infected leaves i0 delays the initial infection without significantly changing the dynamics 4 discussion one of the central issues in coffee rust epidemiology is to understand the factors that explain the great variability in the magnitude of the infection peaks and their timing both at the plant and plot levels avelino et al 1991 li et al 2022 rosas et al 2021 to address this issue many studies have focused on the microclimate avelino et al 2006 plant resistance talhinhas et al 2017 or the susceptibility of leaves during specific stages of the coffee crop cycle salgado et al 2008 nevertheless none of these approaches has succeeded to fully explain the differences in timing and intensity of the epidemics occurring in plots from the same site with equivalent meteorological and plant genetic conditions here we hypothesised that spatial patterns created by rust dispersal in different planting arrangements might be affecting both variables we first documented known trends for the timing and magnitude of the epidemic peak as well as their variability by comparing epidemiological curves from different sites fig 2 from this analysis we distinguish two phases in the epidemic timeline a time lag and a growth phase per se fig 2 and table s1 1 we also noted that the harvesting period correlated with the build up or growth phase fig 2a c g i this is consistent with harvesting and rust infection being related to fruit development and fruit load avelino et al 1993 motisi et al 2022 salgado et al 2008 nevertheless the movements of workers during harvesting might also promote rust dispersal and reinforce the infection motisi et al 2022 our parameterised six model recreates the coffee rust epidemic and helps us to explore some of the mechanisms that may determine properties of the maximum peak and its timing figs 3 6 the values of the maximum average tree infection mati and time to mati were within the range reported in field studies this qualitatively validates the estimates of the model parameters and supports that different planting arrangements and different diffusion rates might provide possible explanations to the variation observed in real dynamics in particular we showed that both the planting arrangement and the diffusion rate jointly modify the mati and time to mati by preventing some plants from reaching their maximum peak figs 4 6 thus explaining part of the variability observed in plots with otherwise similar conditions in particular the aggregated spatial arrangement highly increases the mati compared to the other planting arrangements that did not present quantitative differences between them see video in supplementary material s4 the effects of the planting arrangement are noticeable in the different curves of fig 5 which can be multi stepped or smooth like some of the curves from real data presented in fig 2 the multi stepped pattern is associated with a higher distance between plants in particular in the spaced pattern where plants have no direct neighbours in this sense the differences of the effect of planting patterns on the mati and curves of infection were more related with a planting aggregation threshold or a minimal distance between plants than with the spatial arrangements per se moreover a low i0 increases the time it takes to reach the maximum peak of infection at the plant level and plot level due to delays in the start of the growth phase figs 4 and 5 the time lag differences reported in sites with similar phenological timing li et al 2022 can thus be explained by differences in the initial infection and planting arrangements and not only by the positive correlation between fruit charge and plant susceptibility to infection avelino et al 1993 salgado et al 2008 finally we found that high infected leaf fall rate ɣ strongly affects the whole plot infection dynamics and we hypothesise that this quantity is a key aspect for coffee rust monitoring or intervention at the plot scale park et al 2001 these results have a practical significance regarding coffee rust management they highlight the importance of reducing rust dispersal rates either by having other trees in the plot or by planting coffee plants at larger distances independently of the spatial arrangement per se in order to uncouple individual dynamics and reduce plot infection in particular one should avoid the aggregated arrangement this is h values larger than 1 5 fig s1 4 video s4 this result complements those of hajian forooshani and vandermeer 2021 who tested different critical dispersal distances between coffee plants and reported that the regularity of the planting arrangement pattern modulates the time to reach fully rust infected coffee plots this is relevant for farmers who balance their planting density according to their production necessities and the risk of plot epidemic ehrenbergerová et al 2018 in general conventional coffee management produces very densely aggregated planting patterns that might be prone to coffee leaf rust invasion contrarily to more rustic or ecological coffee plantations that intercalate different kinds of trees between the coffee plants moguel and toledo 1999 besides boudrot et al 2016 and gagliardi et al 2020 reported that the functional traits of plants related to shade foliage density shade percentage modify the relative importance of wind and rainfall in uredospore dispersal across the plot understanding the role of the initial infection and dispersal rate on the time lag is also relevant for rust control procedures that rely heavily on the timing of the epidemic such as pruning management of shade boudrot et al 2016 liebig et al 2019 soto pinto et al 2000 or fungicide application burdekin 1964 mulinge and griffiths 1974 additionally the leaf fall rate of infected leaves can also be modified with management practices but may have an ambiguous effect on the maximum infection on the one hand farmers could decrease the maximum infection by removing and bagging away the infected leaves continuously thus decreasing the source of new reinfections from infected leaves either on the ground or in the plant system but on the other hand due to the farmers movement between the trees removing the leaves could trigger the dispersal of uredospores by contact and further propagate the epidemic the present model also allows us to make recommendations on the ways coffee rust prevalence can be measured and monitored here we worked with the average tree infection because it is one of the more common ways of measuring coffee rust prevalence in coffee plots fig 2 nevertheless this variable is highly dependent on the progression of the infection in the chosen plants and their degree of temporal overlap due to spatial factors fig 6 additionally the average over trees can be an inappropriate measure for the plot infection when individual infections follow a non normal distribution that changes during the epidemic even if we supposed the infection to follow a normal distribution the mean without the variance would not be sufficient other ways of measuring plot infection in the field could consist in drawing spatially explicit plot infection maps li et al 2022 rosas et al 2021 vandermeer et al 2018 in our model we considered rust dispersal from one plant to its four closest neighbours through splash and leaf to leaf contact this assumption was linked to the spatial arrangements that were only significantly different in the 4 neighbour vicinity however in future work it will be important to consider other mechanisms and models for spore dispersal that consider an 8 neighbour range or long range dispersal on the one hand it is known that changing the neighbourhood of interaction can change the probability of plot invasion park et al 2001 also having a different dispersal rate depending on whether the plants are in contact or not can lead to critical transitions in infection dynamics hajian forooshani and vandermeer 2021 vandermeer et al 2018 on the other hand if we were to consider other dispersal mechanisms such as wind gusts or human action during harvesting becker and kranz 1977 the planting arrangements might play a less important role in plot infection this is because spores would reach farther trees and attenuate the relevance of the plot geometry in those scenarios the amount of shade trees that can act as wind barriers would be crucial to reduce dispersal gagliardi et al 2020 and uncouple the individual tree infection dynamics moreover the model considers only one initially infected tree located in the centre of the plot other choices should not qualitatively change our results but might have an effect on the general times of infection the effect of multiple sources of infection should also be studied in future works it is also important to keep in mind that our model assumes that infected fallen leaves are removed from the system bagged away for example and cannot spread infection to neighbouring plants or reinfect in many sites these fallen leaves with spores likely contribute in a meaningful way to infecting plants zachary hajian forooshani personal obs this could be added in the future by defining an additional r compartment in the six equation nevertheless as coffee leaf rust is a biotroph the survival of spores in the fallen leaves is expected to be limited weather covariates like high rainfalls might also influence plant level parameters such as the recruitment of spores from infected leaves α by washing off spores from the leaves this is likely to strongly affect the general dynamics of infection e g reducing the maximum infection figs 2 and s1 7 motisi et al 2022 and should be considered in future works finally our model represents coffee rust infection but does not assess coffee production reduction this relationship is not necessarily linear and must be considered for any practical recommendations cerda et al 2017 control and management practices of coffee rust disease have commonly underestimated the role of dispersal and the relationship between plant and plot dynamics our work contributes to a better understanding of this relationship and can be used as a null model to study the role of specific dispersal mechanisms such as wind splash or human mobility see for example avelino et al 2012 becker and kranz 1977 gagliardi et al 2020 hajian forooshani and vandermeer 2021 it mostly aimed at exploring the general and qualitative mechanisms behind the patterns observed in real systems fig 2 adding context specific conditions would enable us to do some data fitting and quantitative comparisons in a more detailed way than the general times of mati and time to mati presented here recreating and understanding the main mechanisms of coffee rust dispersal is crucial to the development of a preventive approach to epidemics it informs the management processes that seek to balance the different effects that some practices have on the infection and dispersal stages in order to design resilient agroecological coffee systems to coffee rust or other

24311,accurate and effective remote sensing image classification and analysis methods can provide reliable support for the sustainable development of land resources but the current methods can t support the precise processing of complex images to solve this problem this paper proposes a new classification and analysis method of remote sensing image land resources based on deep learning firstly this method first uses envi software to realize image preprocessing on the collected data set and realizes reliable data set at the same time based on the sparse auto encoder network model the sample features of the image data set are deeply mined to make a better reference for category determination and based on elm classifier network convolution layer and sub sampling layer are alternately connected to extract the depth feature of remote sensing image which can greatly reduce the number of network parameters and improve the computational finally the actual collected data set is used for simulation verification and the experimental results show that the accuracy of complex image analysis reaches 98 15 which shows excellent performance of image feature classification and analysis keywords remote sensing image classification of land resources ecological environment sparse auto encoder elm classifier data preprocessing data availability the authors do not have permission to share data 1 introduction land use and land cover are very significant landscape symbols on the earth s surface they represent the spatial pattern changes of the earth s landscape and are inextricably linked with the global ecological environment evolution climate change and the degree of ecological security yazici and inan 2020 mohsenzadeh karimi et al 2022 xu 2019 land use and land cover have great influence on land ocean interaction ecological environment and climate mirzaei et al 2021 as a comprehensive earth observation technology remote sensing rs has begun to develop rapidly with the advantages of abundant information short period fast access and diversified means so it is widely favored by researchers navin and agilandeeswari 2020 fung et al 2020 at present obtaining land use and cover information through remote sensing technology has become one of the key contents in the field of land use land cover change f chen et al 2021 jeyakumar and sudha 2019 accurate remote sensing image analysis and recognition can become an important helper for the sustainable use of land resources traditional image analysis and classification methods mainly include visual interpretation and classification methods based on statistical analysis visual interpretation is the simplest and original classification method which has the advantages of simple operation strong flexibility and easy to extract spatial information however when dealing with complex images visual interpretation has the problems of long time consuming and inaccurate classification results bai et al 2019 the classification method based on statistical analysis only takes the spectral features of ground objects as category features which often leads to low classification accuracy cao et al 2020 with the rapid development of big data technology and artificial intelligence technology deep learning can extract the features of complex images through multi layer network so as to achieve efficient and accurate classification of remote sensing image yuan et al 2019 zhao et al 2020 deeba et al 2021 the application of deep learning technology in remote sensing image has become a hot spot in the field of image analysis in ref h wang et al 2020 a multi scale super pixel segmentation method was used to segment hyperspectral images and the weighted multi scale spatial spectral kernel was combined with the original spatial spectral kernel to complete the classification of land resources zhang b et al 2018 also focuses on the classification of high resolution remote sensing images zhang et al 2018 a high resolution remote sensing image classification network is constructed by combining fully connected conditional random field and support vector machine wang mc et al 2021 introduced the idea of semantic segmentation in the field of remote sensing change detection and proposed a method of building change detection based on res unet model wang et al 2021 chen b et al 2021 builds a remote sensing image analysis model based on multi level feature aggregation network and improves the depth feature extraction and up sampling feature fusion which is of great significance for high resolution remote sensing image analysis b chen et al 2021 however it should be noted that the current remote sensing image acquisition tends to be complex and large dimensional and the network structure of the current analysis method is not enough to support its demand for efficient calculation and analysis weng et al 2018 li et al 2019 to solve the above problems this paper propose a new remote sensing image analysis and classification method that combined sparse auto encoder sae and extreme learning machine elm classifier in this paper a remote sensing image analysis network based on sparse self coding is constructed to realize the deep mining of sample features in image data set in this paper elm classifier is integrated into image analysis network which can ensure the effective improvement of network analysis performance 2 strategies and steps of land resource use classification elm is a fast learning algorithm and only need to calculate the value of output weight in the training process so it has quite high training efficiency however when using elm algorithm for remote sensing image classification the unknown label samples are mapped into prediction categories by learning the mapping between training samples and output labels so only the shallow features of input samples can be learned which is not conducive to the subsequent classification sae network can learn the depth feature through multi layer combination at the same time the input of sae can be an image which can make better use of the spatial relevance of the image as a reference for category determination therefore in order to improve the classification accuracy and meet the classification requirements of multiple data sets this paper makes full use of the advantages of multi layer network and elm and combines them to build a hyperspectral remote sensing image classification method model this paper adds a depth feature extraction layer to the original elm classification algorithm that uses the convolutional layer and the sub sampling layer alternately to extract the depth features of remote sensing images at the same time the full connection layer in the feature extraction network is removed to reduce the amount of network parameters and improve the computational efficiency as can be seen from fig 1 the processing flow of the classification framework mainly includes three steps 1 remote sensing image preprocessing in order to reduce the computational complexity firstly the multi band remote sensing images are reduced to obtain the m dimensional features the input data of ae feature extraction network is two dimensional image and the output result is directly the operation result of the input image for remote sensing image it is necessary to predict the category of each pixel in this paper the current pixel is taken as the center of the image window and the m dimensional features of the pixel are extended to n n neighborhood respectively and then all the pixels are used as the input of sae network 1 feature extraction the convolution layer and sub sampling layer of sae network are connected alternately to extract the depth feature of remote sensing image which is the main optimization part of the original elm classification method 1 classification the extracted features are input into elm algorithm as sample features for classification and the output weights are obtained through a large number of sample training and then each pixel is classified to predict its category in this paper sigmoid function is selected as the activation function of elm algorithm the number of hidden layer nodes l needs to be set manually when elm is used for classification at present there is no given standard for the value of l which depends on the specific situation 3 overview of the study area and basic data preprocessing 3 1 overview of the study area the study area selected in this paper is located in bazhou city hebei province china with a geographical location between 11 6 o 15 11 6 o 40 e and 3 9 o 21 3 9 o 50 n bazhou is adjacent to xiqing district of tianjin in the east xiong an new district in the west wen an county in the south and gu an county and yongqing county in the north the terrain of bazhou city is low and flat leaning slowly from the northwest to the southeast the total land area of bazhou city is 784 k m 2 of which residential land industrial and mining land are 150 5 k m 2 accounting for 19 20 of the total land area the traffic land is 13 9 k m 2 accounting for 1 77 of the total land the land for water conservancy facilities is 3 7 k m 2 accounting for 0 47 of the total land the data sets used in this paper are the high spatial resolution remote sensing images and the land use vector data of bazhou city hebei province in the data set the high spatial resolution remote sensing image of bazhou city was acquired on september 26 2020 and the type was world view 2 color composite image its spatial resolution was 0 5 m which contained three bands of rgb the vector data of land use comes from the survey database of land use change in 2020 the data can provide reference for the organization of samples and the labeling of corresponding labels of features which is conducive to enhancing the objectivity accuracy and accuracy of samples the data set includes training samples test samples and verification samples one 3000 3000 pixel image slice and two 2000 2000 pixel image slices are respectively intercepted from the whole remote sensing image of bazhou city in hebei province as training samples and one 3000 3000 pixel image slice is taken as verification samples the location of data samples is shown in fig 2 in this paper the extraction of rural construction land rural buildings in high spatial resolution remote sensing images can fully show its details resulting in complex spectral features large intra class spectral difference small inter class spectral difference which increases the difficulty of rural building extraction huang et al 2018 therefore this paper takes full account of the spectral characteristics of rural buildings and selects the areas with wide coverage of spectral characteristics as the sample areas the selected samples are representative so as to avoid over fitting the model and enhance the generalization ability at the same time some studies show that the semantic segmentation model of deep convolution neural network is very sensitive to the balance of positive and negative samples in binary classification and the balanced data set can greatly improve the classification performance of the classifier in the actual process of sample selection it is difficult to achieve the balance of positive and negative samples so this paper uses the strategy of oversampling a small number of samples to solve the problem of the balance of positive and negative samples the size of the intercepted training samples is large and the computing power of software and hardware is limited so it can not be directly input into the network for training so it is necessary to cut the training samples before training the semantic segmentation model yang et al 2019 however in the high spatial resolution remote sensing images the rural housing buildings present a compact rectangular shape and the rural hardened roads present a regular strip shape when the cutting scale is too small it will destroy the spatial structure characteristics of rural buildings reduce the generalization ability of the model and affect the accuracy of classification when the cutting scale is too large the spatial structure characteristics of rural buildings can be completely preserved but a large amount of memory visual memory and time are needed to train the model moreover the larger the cutting scale is the smaller the sample size is and the more prone the over fitting phenomenon appears in the training process therefore too large or too small sample segmentation scale will affect the efficiency of semantic segmentation model training and the final classification effect in this paper the best classification scale of different objects is explored through the experiment of high spatial resolution remote sensing image classification based on multi scale sample semantic segmentation the experimental results are shown in fig 3 when the image cutting size is 128 128 pixels and step size is 64 pixels the classification accuracy of buildings can reach 94 24 the semantic segmentation model needs a large number of training sets to avoid over fitting in the process of training so this paper uses 64 pixel overlapping cut to expand the amount of data the strategy of verification sample is consistent with that of training sample not only the spatial and spectral characteristics of buildings should be considered but also the overlapping cutting should be carried out the overlapping cutting here can reduce the stitching traces in the classification process and improve the classification effect 3 2 data preprocessing various conditions during the shooting process caused poor image quality for example the cloudiness of remote sensing images captured by satellites with thick clouds on cloudy days is relatively large so manual selection of the images is required the selected image data contains many errors so it is necessary to preprocess the data in this paper envi 5 3 is used for preprocessing fan and zhao 2019 mainly including radiometric calibration orthorectification image fusion and so on the specific data preprocessing process is shown in fig 4 1 radiometric calibration the purpose of radiometric calibration is to eliminate interference which mostly comes from the error caused by the sensor itself when correcting the error it is necessary to know the radiation value of the sensor inlet in order to accurately repair radiometric calibration is divided into absolute calibration and relative calibration absolute calibration refers to the quantitative relationship between the digital quantization value of the imaging spectrometer output and the spectral radiation value at the entrance of the imaging spectrometer passing through different standard radiation sources relative calibration is to determine the relative value of the amount of radiation measured at different times in the scene between spectra between pixels and between different detectors when the spectral radiance or spectral reflectance of the object is calculated or when the remote sensing images acquired by simultaneous interpreting or using different time and different sensors are needed the brightness value of the remote sensing image must be converted to absolute radiance 1 orthorectification when the satellite is running the influence of the earth s rotation leads to the geometric distortion of the image due to the large shape deformation of ground objects the corresponding information can not be obtained correctly therefore it is necessary to ortho correct the original image orthophoto correction is to obtain the information of control points on the ground combined with satellite coefficients to form correction formula so as to produce accurate orthophoto image ortho rectification algorithm can not only improve the geometric distortion caused by external factors but also eliminate the geometric distortion caused by terrain and effectively improve the image quality this paper uses rpc in envi toolbox for correction select the image and modify the output cell size the pixel size of multispectral image is 4 and the unit size of panchromatic image is 1 m the resampling method is cubic convolution and other parameters are reserved by default only after orthorectification can the error caused by shooting angle be changed so that the information extracted from the image is more accurate 1 image fusion image fusion is the resampling of high resolution panchromatic single band image and low spatial resolution multispectral image so as to generate high quality image with both multispectral multi channel information and all image resolution st et al 2021 in order to make full use of the remote sensing image it is necessary to select appropriate multispectral and panchromatic fusion methods in this paper the nndiffuse pan sharpening method in envi software is used for fusion the image obtained by the fusion method fully retains the color texture and spectral information of the original image and the processing efficiency is high the fused remote sensing image is shown in fig 5 4 sparse self encoding classification algorithm the common method of deep learning auto encoder it is a neural network that can reproduce the input signal as much as possible sparsity constraint conditions are added on the basis of self coding and most of the data is required to be 0 the result is sparse auto encoder noise reduction auto encoder the input it needs is completely free from noise interference so we need to remove the noise added to the training data through learning sparse coding it establishes a set of super complete basis vectors and uses the set of super complete basis vectors to efficiently represent data restricted boltzmann machine rbm it is a typical neural network which is composed of visible layer and hidden layer units the visible layer units are independent of each other and the hidden layer units are also independent of each other the visible layer and the hidden layer are interconnected with each other and the hidden unit can obtain the high order correlation of the input visible unit deep trust networks in order to optimize the deep structure the deep trust network proposes the unsupervised greedy layer by layer training method the dbn is composed of a series of restricted boltzmann machine rbm units convolutional neural network cnn it is a trainable multi layer structure composed of multiple layers it uses the spatial relative relationship to reduce the number of parameters to improve the bp training performance in this paper the input signal is reconstructed as much as possible by using the characteristics of multilayer network structure of self coding neural network the greedy layer by layer training algorithm is used to initialize the network parameters and then fine tune the network parameters to find the optimal network structure 4 1 sparse self encoding structure assuming that the category of the original data is unlabeled the training sample set of the data is x r d x is input to the coding layer and f is mapped to the hidden layer through the activation function to obtain the eigenvalue z r d 1 z f θ x σ w x b where θ w b σ t 1 1 e t w is the weight matrix b is the coding layer offset vector take l as

coding network includes the pre training process and the fine tuning process firstly the unlabeled data is used to get the optimized network parameters and then the back propagation algorithm is used to fine tune the parameters to find the optimal structure fig 7 lists two sparse self coding neural networks stacked together to extract image features layer by layer and the dimension is gradually reduced if the number of hidden layers is less than the number of input layers it is equivalent to reducing the dimension of data which can effectively reduce the complexity in order to train the stackable sparse self coding neural network parameter w b the first hidden layer is trained by using the unlabeled training sample set in fig 7 the input layer is the remote sensing image set containing d samples and 1 is the bias coefficient z n 1 and z l 2 represent the features learned by the first sparse self coding neural network and the second sparse self coding neural network respectively the output of the first layer is used as the input of the second layer and the output of the second hidden layer is used as the input of the classifier 1 m represents the label to which the sample belongs the gradient descent method is used to update the parameters of each layer and the back propagation algorithm is used to fine tune the parameters 1 forward propagation process take a three layer input as an example to illustrate the functional relationship between the output of hidden layer and the input data z 1 2 represents the first output of the second layer which is the weighted sum of the three input neurons of the first layer z 2 2 represents the second output of the second layer and so on 7 z 1 2 f w 11 1 x 1 w 12 1 x 2 w 13 1 x 3 b 1 1 8 z 2 2 f w 21 1 x 1 w 22 1

optimized repeatedly to obtain the minimum value of the cost function which is the optimal network model x wang et al 2020 the results of sparse self coding may not be satisfactory and there is still a lot of room to improve the classification accuracy in order to improve the classification accuracy elm classifier is introduced in this paper the combination of sparse self coding and elm is much better than using only one method the global optimal solution can be obtained by solving the minimum value of feature learning cost function after training elm multi classifiers the accuracy of elm classifier image classification is measured put the test sample into the trained elm multi classifier to get the classification label if the classification label is consistent with the classification label in the test sample it means that the classification is correct if not it is necessary to count the classification accuracy that is divide the number of correct samples in the test sample by the total number of samples the algorithm flow based on sparse self encoding includes the following steps step 1 select appropriate training samples to ensure that there is at least one of each sample in the initial training set step 2 sparse self coding is applied to the training set to obtain the network structure parameters w and b step 3 extract the features of all training samples by updating w and b and then add the elm classifier to perform supervised learning to obtain the classifier parameters step 4 the sparse self coding and classifier are cascaded to perform supervised learning on the whole network again to fine tune the parameters of the whole network step 5 classify the test samples and output the classification results 5 experiment and analysis the verification and simulation of the proposed method are carried out on a high performance computer and all the comparison methods run in a unified software and hardware environment the experimental hardware and software configurations are shown in table 1 the experimental codes of remote sensing semantic segmentation method proposed in this paper are all implemented by python language 5 1 parameter optimization setting elm hidden layer neuron number and learning rate have an important impact on the quality of remote sensing image classification this paper analyzes the performance of classification network parameters through continuous comparison and optimization on the basis of the same experimental conditions the classification accuracy of elm with 50 100 150 200 250 300 and 350 neurons was compared the experimental results are shown in fig 8 it can be seen that the classification accuracy fluctuates with the number of neurons in the hidden layer when the number of hidden layer neurons reaches 200 the classification effect is the best and the classification accuracy is 93 29 when the number of neurons exceeds 200 the proposed network model appears over fitting phenomenon and the classification accuracy decreases with the increase of the number of neurons in the hidden layer the number of neurons in elm hidden layer determines the degree of extracting feature information from input data if the number of neurons in elm hidden layer is too small the characteristic information of input data can not be accurately expressed while too many neurons will increase the training time and complexity of the pre raining process and even the network appears over fitting in this paper the random gradient descent algorithm is used to train the classification network and the training step is adjusted by the learning rate on the basis of the same experimental conditions the classification accuracy is compared when the learning rate is 0 1 to 1 1 and the step size is 0 1 the experimental results are shown in fig 9 experiments show that the classification accuracy of the model varies with the learning rate when the learning rate is low the classification accuracy of the model increases with the increase of the learning rate when the learning rate reaches 0 5 the classification accuracy of the model is the best reaching 98 15 when the learning rate exceeds 0 5 the over fitting phenomenon appears and the overall classification accuracy shows a downward trend in the forward unsupervised learning process of the model the learning rate is mainly responsible for updating the weights in the back propagation fine tuning process the learning rate is responsible for adjusting the convergence rate of the whole model which has a crucial impact on the classification accuracy in addition lower learning rate will increase the credibility of training results but the training process will take a long time the higher learning rate makes the change of connection weight too large which may lead to the non convergence of training and unstable output other network parameters are shown in table 2 5 2 example analysis in order to verify the performance of this method this paper takes the methods in ref h wang et al 2020 and wang et al 2021 as a comparative method and carries out simulation analysis on the collected data set all image analysis experiments were carried out in the same experimental environment fig 10 shows the analysis results of different methods for the actual image data set of bazhou city as shown in fig 10 the proposed method achieves the optimization of network performance in the 30th iteration the classification accuracy can be maintained at 98 15 and the network performance tends to be stable in the 50th iteration the method of ref h wang et al 2020 achieves the final classification and its accuracy is 92 82 which is far less than the effect of the proposed method the method of ref wang et al 2021 does not converge at the set number of iterations and the network is still in oscillation state in this paper a remote sensing image analysis method is constructed based on sparse self coding network structure the depth features of input samples are learned through multi layer combination and then the spatial correlation of images is better used as a reference for category determination in order to intuitively analyze the classification performance of the proposed method and the comparison methods this paper qualitatively analyzes the recognition accuracy fig 11 shows the identification results of residential areas by different methods according to the characteristic analysis of the original figure in fig 11 a the residential areas are widely distributed with irregular edges and scattered areas which easily lead to the deviation of classification results the recognition results of the proposed method are shown in fig 11 b which can more accurately identify the residential areas in the figure the effect of the method in ref h wang et al 2020 is shown in fig 11 c this method identifies part of the green plants as residential areas which has recognition bias and the accuracy of land resource identification is not ideal ref wang et al 2021 uses u shaped network model which has low efficiency in network computing and processing and can not support high precision analysis of complex images fig 12 shows the identification results of different methods for the forest in the sample as can be seen from fig 12 the forests are scattered with complex shape features and irregular edges as shown in fig 12 b the proposed method has better image analysis performance than the comparison method sae and elm fusion network can further mine the sample features in the image to achieve high precision analysis of forest features the results of the methods in ref h wang et al 2020 and wang et al 2021 are shown in fig 12 c and d respectively when the principal component analysis network and unet network of these two methods identify and analyze the image semantic elements they need to label the image elements and set the network parameters randomly in the early stage of network analysis which has a certain impact on the recognition accuracy of forest elements in remote sensing images the image analysis method combining sae network and elm classification used in this paper can support the demand of high precision analysis for the actual image acquisition and has good identification ability 6 conclusion this paper proposes a remote sensing image degree analysis method based on deep learning the accuracy of this method for complex image classification analysis xceeds 95 showing excellent image classification ability the reason is that sae model and elm classifier model are combined to improve the accuracy of image analysis at the same time the structure of sparse self coding network can also realize the deep mining of image features in this paper elm classifier is used to extract the depth feature of remote sensing image to ensure the computational efficiency of the network however in the process of image acquisition fog rain and other weather factors will further lead to the complexity of the collected data set so it is necessary to select the image manually in the future the combination of filtering method and particle swarm optimization algorithm will be used to realize the efficient preprocessing of the original image data set so as to further improve the analysis ability of complex images so as to meet the needs of more complex remote sensing image efficient

24311,accurate and effective remote sensing image classification and analysis methods can provide reliable support for the sustainable development of land resources but the current methods can t support the precise processing of complex images to solve this problem this paper proposes a new classification and analysis method of remote sensing image land resources based on deep learning

permission to share data 1 introduction land use and land cover are very significant landscape symbols on the earth s surface they represent the spatial pattern changes of the earth s landscape and are inextricably linked with the global ecological environment evolution climate change and the degree of ecological security yazici and inan 2020 mohsenzadeh karimi et al 2022 xu 2019 land use and land cover have great influence on land ocean interaction ecological environment and climate mirzaei et al 2021 as a comprehensive earth observation technology remote sensing rs has begun to develop rapidly with the advantages of abundant information short period fast access and diversified means so it is widely favored by researchers navin and agilandeeswari 2020 fung et al 2020 at present obtaining land use and cover information through remote sensing technology has become one of the key contents in the field of land use land cover change f chen et al 2021 jeyakumar and sudha 2019 accurate remote sensing image analysis and recognition can become an important helper for the sustainable use of land resources traditional image analysis and classification methods mainly include visual interpretation and classification methods based on statistical analysis visual interpretation is the simplest and original classification method which has the advantages of simple operation strong flexibility and easy to extract spatial information however when dealing with complex images visual interpretation has the problems of long time consuming and inaccurate classification results bai et al 2019 the classification method based on statistical analysis only takes the spectral features of ground objects as category features which often leads to low classification accuracy cao et al 2020 with the rapid development of big data technology and artificial intelligence technology deep learning can extract the features of complex images through multi layer network so as to achieve efficient and accurate classification of remote sensing image yuan et al 2019 zhao et al 2020 deeba et al 2021 the application of deep learning technology in remote sensing image has become a hot spot in the field of image analysis in ref h wang et al 2020 a multi scale super pixel segmentation method was used to segment hyperspectral images and the weighted multi scale spatial spectral kernel was combined with the original spatial spectral kernel to complete the classification of land resources zhang b et al 2018 also focuses on the classification of high resolution remote sensing images zhang et al 2018 a high resolution remote sensing image classification network is constructed by combining fully connected conditional random field and support vector machine wang mc et al 2021 introduced the idea of semantic segmentation in the field of remote sensing change detection and proposed a method of building change detection based on res unet model wang et al 2021 chen b et al 2021 builds a remote sensing image analysis model based on multi level feature aggregation network and improves the depth feature extraction and up sampling feature fusion which is of great significance for high resolution remote sensing image analysis b chen et al 2021 however it should be noted that the current remote sensing image acquisition tends to be complex and large dimensional and the network structure of the current analysis method is not enough to support its demand for efficient calculation and analysis weng et al 2018 li et al 2019 to solve the above problems this paper propose a new remote sensing image analysis and classification method that combined sparse auto encoder sae and extreme learning machine elm classifier in this paper a remote sensing image analysis network based on sparse self coding is constructed to realize the deep mining of sample features in image data set in this paper elm classifier is integrated into image analysis network which can ensure the effective improvement of network analysis performance 2 strategies and steps of land resource use classification elm is a fast learning algorithm and only need to calculate the value of output weight in the training process so it has quite high training efficiency however when using elm algorithm for remote sensing image classification the unknown label samples are mapped into prediction categories by learning the mapping between training samples and output labels so only the shallow features of input samples can be learned which is not conducive to the subsequent classification sae network can learn the depth feature through multi layer combination at the same time the input of sae can be an image which can make better use of the spatial relevance of the image as a reference for category determination therefore in order to improve the classification accuracy and meet the classification requirements of multiple data sets this paper makes full use of the advantages of multi layer network and elm and combines them to build a hyperspectral remote sensing image classification method model this paper adds a depth feature extraction layer to the original elm classification algorithm that uses the convolutional layer and the sub sampling layer alternately to extract the depth features of remote sensing images at the same time the full connection layer in the feature extraction network is removed to reduce the amount of network parameters and improve the computational efficiency as can be seen from fig 1 the processing flow of the classification framework mainly includes three steps 1 remote sensing image preprocessing in order to reduce the computational complexity firstly the multi band remote sensing images are reduced to obtain the m dimensional features the input data of ae feature extraction network is two dimensional image and the output result is directly the operation result of the input image for remote sensing image it is necessary to predict the category of each pixel in this paper the current pixel is taken as the center of the image window and the m dimensional features of the pixel are extended to n n neighborhood respectively and then all the pixels are used as the input of sae network 1 feature extraction the convolution layer and sub sampling layer of sae network are connected alternately to extract the depth feature of remote sensing image which is the main optimization part of the original elm classification method 1 classification the extracted features are input into elm algorithm as sample features for classification and the output weights are obtained through a large number of sample training and then each pixel is classified to predict its category in this paper sigmoid function is selected as the activation function of elm algorithm the number of hidden layer nodes l needs to be set manually when elm is used for classification at present there is no given standard for the value of l which depends on the specific situation 3 overview of the study area and basic data preprocessing 3 1 overview of the study area the study area selected in this paper is located in bazhou city hebei province china with a geographical location between 11 6 o 15 11 6 o 40 e and 3 9 o 21 3 9 o 50 n bazhou is adjacent to xiqing district of tianjin in the east xiong an new district in the west wen an county in the south and gu an county and yongqing county in the north the terrain of bazhou city is low and flat leaning slowly from the northwest to the southeast the total land area of bazhou city is 784 k m 2 of which residential land industrial and mining land are 150 5 k m 2 accounting for 19 20 of the total land area the traffic land is 13 9 k m 2 accounting for 1 77 of the total land the land for water conservancy facilities is 3 7 k m 2 accounting for 0 47 of the total land the data sets used in this paper are the high spatial resolution remote sensing images and the land use vector data of bazhou city hebei province in the data set the high spatial resolution remote sensing image of bazhou city was acquired on september 26 2020 and the type was world view 2 color composite image its spatial resolution was 0 5 m which contained three bands of rgb the vector data of land use comes from the survey database of land use change in 2020 the data can provide reference for the organization of samples and the labeling of corresponding labels of features which is conducive to enhancing the objectivity accuracy and accuracy of samples the data set includes training samples test samples and verification samples one 3000 3000 pixel image slice and two 2000 2000 pixel image slices are respectively intercepted from the whole remote sensing image of bazhou city in hebei province as training samples and one 3000 3000 pixel image slice is taken as verification samples the location of data samples is shown in fig 2 in this paper the extraction of rural construction land rural buildings in high spatial resolution remote sensing images can fully show its details resulting in complex spectral features large intra class spectral difference small inter class spectral difference which increases the difficulty of rural building extraction huang et al 2018 therefore this paper takes full account of the spectral characteristics of rural buildings and selects the areas with wide coverage of spectral characteristics as the sample areas the selected samples are representative so as to avoid over fitting the model and enhance the generalization ability at the same time some studies show that the semantic segmentation model of deep convolution neural network is very sensitive to the balance of positive and negative samples in binary classification and the balanced data set can greatly improve the classification performance of the classifier in the actual process of sample selection it is difficult to achieve the balance of positive and negative samples so this paper uses the strategy of oversampling a small number of samples to solve the problem of the balance of positive and negative samples the size of the intercepted training samples is large and the computing power of software and hardware is limited so it can not be directly input into the network for training so it is necessary to cut the training samples before training the semantic segmentation model yang et al 2019 however in the high spatial resolution remote sensing images the rural housing buildings present a compact rectangular shape and the rural hardened roads present a regular strip shape when the cutting scale is too small it will destroy the spatial structure characteristics of rural buildings reduce the generalization ability of the model and affect the accuracy of classification when the cutting scale is too large the spatial structure characteristics of rural buildings can be completely preserved but a large amount of memory visual memory and time are needed to train the model moreover the larger the cutting scale is the smaller the sample size is and the more prone the over fitting phenomenon appears in the training process therefore too large or too small sample segmentation scale will affect the efficiency of semantic segmentation model training and the final classification effect in this paper the best classification scale of different objects is explored through the experiment of high spatial resolution remote sensing image classification based on multi scale sample semantic segmentation the experimental results are shown in fig 3 when the image cutting size is 128 128 pixels and step size is 64 pixels the classification accuracy of buildings can reach 94 24 the semantic segmentation model needs a large number of training sets to avoid over fitting in the process of training so this paper uses 64 pixel overlapping cut to expand the amount of data the strategy of verification sample is consistent with that of training sample not only the spatial and spectral characteristics of buildings should be considered but also the overlapping cutting should be carried out the overlapping cutting here can reduce the stitching traces in the classification process and improve the classification effect 3 2 data preprocessing various conditions during the shooting process caused poor image quality for example the cloudiness of remote sensing images captured by satellites with thick clouds on cloudy days is relatively large so manual selection of the images is required the selected image data contains many errors so it is necessary to preprocess the data in this paper envi 5 3 is used for preprocessing fan and zhao 2019 mainly including radiometric calibration orthorectification image fusion and so on the specific data preprocessing process is shown in fig 4 1 radiometric calibration the purpose of radiometric calibration is to eliminate interference which mostly comes from the error caused by the sensor itself when correcting the error it is necessary to know the radiation value of the sensor inlet in order to accurately repair radiometric calibration is divided into absolute calibration and relative calibration absolute calibration refers to the quantitative relationship between the digital quantization value of the imaging spectrometer output and the spectral radiation value at the entrance of the imaging spectrometer passing through different standard radiation sources relative calibration is to determine the relative value of the amount of radiation measured at different times in the scene between spectra between pixels and between different detectors when the spectral radiance or spectral reflectance of the object is calculated or when the remote sensing images acquired by simultaneous interpreting or using different time and different sensors are needed the brightness value of the remote sensing image must be converted to absolute radiance 1 orthorectification when the satellite is running the influence of the earth s rotation leads to the geometric distortion of the image due to the large shape deformation of ground objects the corresponding information can not be obtained correctly therefore it is necessary to ortho correct the original image orthophoto correction is to obtain the information of control points on the ground combined with satellite coefficients to form correction formula so as to produce accurate orthophoto image ortho rectification algorithm can not only improve the geometric distortion caused by external factors but also eliminate the geometric distortion caused by terrain and effectively improve the image quality this paper uses rpc in envi toolbox for correction select the image and modify the output cell size the pixel size of multispectral image is 4 and the unit size of panchromatic image is 1 m the resampling method is cubic convolution and other parameters are reserved by default only after orthorectification can the error caused by shooting angle be changed so that the information extracted from the image is more accurate 1 image fusion image fusion is the resampling of high resolution panchromatic single band image and low spatial resolution multispectral image so as to generate high quality image with both multispectral multi channel information and all image resolution st et al 2021 in order to make full use of the remote sensing image it is necessary to select appropriate multispectral and panchromatic fusion methods in this paper the nndiffuse pan sharpening method in envi software is used for fusion the image obtained by the fusion method fully retains the color texture and spectral information of the original image and the processing efficiency is high the fused remote sensing image is shown in fig 5 4 sparse self encoding classification algorithm the common method of deep learning auto encoder it is a neural network that can reproduce the input signal as much as possible sparsity constraint conditions are added on the basis of self coding and most of the data is required to be 0 the result is sparse auto encoder noise reduction auto encoder the input it needs is completely free from noise interference so we need to remove the noise added to the training data through learning sparse coding it establishes a set of super complete basis vectors and uses the set of super complete basis vectors to efficiently represent data restricted boltzmann machine rbm it is a typical neural network which is composed of visible layer and hidden layer units the visible layer units are independent of each other and the hidden layer units are also independent of each other the visible layer and the hidden layer are interconnected with each other and the hidden unit can obtain the high order correlation of the input visible unit deep trust networks in order to optimize the deep structure the deep trust network proposes the unsupervised greedy layer by layer training method the dbn is composed of a series of restricted boltzmann machine rbm units convolutional neural network cnn it is a trainable multi layer structure composed of multiple layers it uses the spatial relative relationship to reduce the number of parameters to improve the bp training performance in this paper the input signal is reconstructed as much as possible by using the characteristics of multilayer network structure of self coding neural network the greedy layer by layer training algorithm is used to initialize the network parameters and then fine tune the network parameters to find the optimal network structure 4 1 sparse self encoding structure assuming that the category of the original data is unlabeled the training sample set of the data is x r d x is input to the coding layer and f is

adjusting w and b the reconstruction error is minimized 5 l x y 1 2 x y 2 compared with the self encoding structure sparse self encoding has more sparsity constraints than self encoding the sparsity

i is the average activation value of j a j 2 x i is the activation value of input vector x for hidden layer j usually let ρ j ρ but ρ is usually a number close to 0 so that the activation of neurons can be close to 0 eqn 4 22 fig 6 shows the structure of sparse self coding network 4 2 stack sparse self coding network structure the process of finding the optimal network structure in deep self coding network includes the pre training process and the fine tuning process firstly the unlabeled data is used to get the optimized network parameters and then the back propagation algorithm is used to fine tune the parameters to find the optimal structure fig 7 lists two sparse self coding neural networks stacked together to extract image features layer by layer and the dimension is gradually reduced if the number of hidden layers is less than the number of input layers it is equivalent to reducing the dimension of data which can effectively reduce the complexity in order to train the stackable sparse self coding neural network parameter w b the first hidden layer is trained by using the unlabeled training sample set in fig 7 the input layer is the remote sensing image set containing d samples and 1 is the bias coefficient z n 1 and z l 2 represent the features learned by the first sparse self coding neural network and the second sparse self coding neural network respectively the output of the first layer is used as the input of the second layer and the output of the second hidden layer is used as the input of the classifier 1 m represents the label to which the sample belongs the gradient descent method is used to update the parameters of each layer and the back propagation algorithm is used to fine tune the parameters 1 forward propagation process take a three layer input as an example to illustrate the functional relationship between the output of hidden layer and the input data z 1 2 represents the first output of the second layer which is the weighted sum of the three input neurons of the first layer z 2 2 represents the second output of the second layer and so on 7 z 1 2 f w 11 1 x 1 w 12 1 x 2 w 13 1 x 3 b 1 1 8 z 2 2 f w 21 1 x 1 w 22 1

optimized repeatedly to obtain the minimum value of the cost function which is the optimal network model x wang et al 2020 the results of sparse self coding may not be satisfactory and there is still a lot of room to improve the classification accuracy in order to improve the classification accuracy elm classifier is introduced in this paper the combination of sparse self coding and elm is much better than using only one method the global optimal solution can be obtained by solving the minimum value of feature learning cost function after training elm multi classifiers the accuracy of elm classifier image classification is measured put the test sample into the trained elm multi classifier to get the classification label if the classification label is consistent with the classification label in the test sample it means that the classification is correct if not it is necessary to count the classification accuracy that is divide the number of correct samples in the test sample by the total number of samples the algorithm flow based on sparse self encoding includes the following steps step 1 select appropriate training samples to ensure that there is at least one of each sample in the initial training set step 2 sparse self coding is applied to the training set to obtain the network structure parameters w and b step 3 extract the features of all training samples by updating w and b and then add the elm classifier to perform supervised learning to obtain the classifier parameters step 4 the sparse self coding and classifier are cascaded to perform supervised learning on the whole network again to fine tune the parameters of the whole network step 5 classify the test samples and output the classification results 5 experiment and analysis the verification and simulation of the proposed method are carried out on a high performance computer and all the comparison methods run in a unified software and hardware environment the experimental hardware and software configurations are shown in table 1 the experimental codes of remote sensing semantic segmentation method proposed in this paper are all implemented by python language 5 1 parameter optimization setting elm hidden layer neuron number and learning rate have an important impact on the quality of remote sensing image classification this paper analyzes the performance of classification network parameters through continuous comparison and optimization on the basis of the same experimental conditions the classification accuracy of elm with 50 100 150 200 250 300 and 350 neurons was compared the experimental results are shown in fig 8 it can be seen that the classification accuracy fluctuates with the number of neurons in the hidden layer when the number of hidden layer neurons reaches 200 the classification effect is the best and the classification accuracy is 93 29 when the number of neurons exceeds 200 the proposed network model appears over fitting phenomenon and the classification accuracy decreases with the increase of the number of neurons in the hidden layer the number of neurons in elm hidden layer determines the degree of extracting feature information from input data if the number of neurons in elm hidden layer is too small the characteristic information of input data can not be accurately expressed while too many neurons will increase the training time and complexity of the pre raining process and even the network appears over fitting in this paper the random gradient descent algorithm is used to train the classification network and the training step is adjusted by the learning rate on the basis of the same experimental conditions the classification accuracy is compared when the learning rate is 0 1 to 1 1 and the step size is 0 1 the experimental results are shown in fig 9 experiments show that the classification accuracy of the model varies with the learning rate when the learning rate is low the classification accuracy of the model increases with the increase of the learning rate when the learning rate reaches 0 5 the classification accuracy of the model is the best reaching 98 15 when the learning rate exceeds 0 5 the over fitting phenomenon appears and the overall classification accuracy shows a downward trend in the forward unsupervised learning process of the model the learning rate is mainly responsible for updating the weights in the back propagation fine tuning process the learning rate is responsible for adjusting the convergence rate of the whole model which has a crucial impact on the classification accuracy in addition lower learning rate will increase the credibility of training results but the training process will take a long time the higher learning rate makes the change of connection weight too large which may lead to the non convergence of training and unstable output other network parameters are shown in table 2 5 2 example analysis in order to verify the performance of this method this paper takes the methods in ref h wang et al 2020 and wang et al 2021 as a comparative method and carries out simulation analysis on the collected data set all image analysis experiments were carried out in the same experimental environment fig 10 shows the analysis results of different methods for the actual image data set of bazhou city as shown in fig 10 the proposed method achieves the optimization of network performance in the 30th iteration the classification accuracy can be maintained at 98 15 and the network performance tends to be stable in the 50th iteration the method of ref h wang et al 2020 achieves the final classification and its accuracy is 92 82 which is far less than the effect of the proposed method the method of ref wang et al 2021 does not converge at the set number of iterations and the network is still in oscillation state in this paper a remote sensing image analysis method is constructed based on sparse self coding network structure the depth features of input samples are learned through multi layer combination and then the spatial correlation of images is better used as a reference for category determination in order to intuitively analyze the classification performance of the proposed method and the comparison methods this paper qualitatively analyzes the recognition accuracy fig 11 shows the identification results of residential areas by different methods according to the characteristic analysis of the original figure in fig 11 a the residential areas are widely distributed with irregular edges and scattered areas which easily lead to the deviation of classification results the recognition results of the proposed method are shown in fig 11 b which can more accurately identify the residential areas in the figure the effect of the method in ref h wang et al 2020 is shown in fig 11 c this method identifies part of the green plants as residential areas which has recognition bias and the accuracy of land resource identification is not ideal ref wang et al 2021 uses u shaped network model which has low efficiency in network computing and processing and can not support high precision analysis of complex images fig 12 shows the identification results of different methods for the forest in the sample as can be seen from fig 12 the forests are scattered with complex shape features and irregular edges as shown in fig 12 b the proposed method has better image analysis performance than the comparison method sae and elm fusion network can further mine the sample features in the image to achieve high precision analysis of forest features the results of the methods in ref h wang et al 2020 and wang et al 2021 are shown in fig 12 c and d respectively when the principal component analysis network and unet network of these two methods identify and analyze the image semantic elements they need to label the image elements and set the network parameters randomly in the early stage of network analysis which has a certain impact on the recognition accuracy of forest elements in remote sensing images the image analysis method combining sae network and elm classification used in this paper can support the demand of high precision analysis for the actual image acquisition and has good identification ability 6 conclusion this paper proposes a remote sensing image degree analysis method based on deep learning the accuracy of this method for complex image classification analysis xceeds 95 showing excellent image classification ability the reason is that sae model and elm classifier model are combined to improve the accuracy of image analysis at the same time the structure of sparse self coding network can also realize the deep mining of image features in this paper elm classifier is used to extract the depth feature of remote sensing image to ensure the computational efficiency of the network however in the process of image acquisition fog rain and other weather factors will further lead to the complexity of the collected data set so it is necessary to select the image manually in the future the combination of filtering method and particle swarm optimization algorithm will be used to realize the efficient preprocessing of the original image data set so as to further improve the analysis ability of complex images so as to meet the needs of more complex remote sensing image efficient

24312,reconstructions of population histories can shed light on the impact of citizen surveillance on managed populations this can inform efforts to make best use of citizen surveillance as an alternative or complement to organised surveillance by public agencies in conservation sustainable harvesting and control programs we reconstructed the history of an invasive population of red imported fire ants solenopsis invicta and the management actions taken to eradicate the population some of which were influenced by citizen reports the invasion histories were represented as a graph that considered relationships between citizen reports invader population dynamics and management actions we estimated that citizen reports slowed the invasion s spread and or reduced the cost of containment our approach can readily be extended to estimate the impact of citizen surveillance support programs and thereby provide a rigorous empirical basis for the design of such programs keywords citizen surveillance impact evaluation counterfactual valuation data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction the voluntary provision of information by private citizens citizen surveillance has become one of the main sources of information on many wild populations reflecting the high cost of organised surveillance by public agencies for example the australasian fishes project has collected over 66 000 citizen observations in less than 3 years kelly et al 2020 and citizen reports comprise a large proportion of the detections recorded in australia s primary wildlife database the atlas of living australia pecl et al 2015 despite the large number of observations made by private citizens on managed populations there is a general lack of empirical evidence on the contribution of citizen surveillance to population management outcomes instead a more common focus of analysis has been on estimating the contribution of citizen surveillance data for research rather than management purposes these are very different uses of citizen surveillance data when used to conduct research citizen surveillance data can facilitate improved inferences about species distributions la sorte and somveille 2020 including changes in distributions over time neate clegg et al 2020 and anthropogenic influences on those changes sherbinin et al 2021 although these research findings are of general interest they may provide only limited guidance on how to make best use of citizen surveillance to address a current population management problem in this context citizen surveillance can potentially improve program outcomes in conservation harvesting and control programs by replacing and or augmenting organised surveillance by public agencies these beneficial contributions of citizen surveillance include reduced management costs when citizen surveillance replaces higher cost organised surveillance activities and improved management effectiveness when citizen detections occur in locations where organised surveillance would not have occurred these gains in management effectiveness can be reflected in larger populations of threatened species lloyd et al 2020 larger sustainable harvests of harvested species and avoided commercial and amenity losses from earlier detection of invasive species epanchin niell et al 2021 caley et al 2020 the management benefits of citizen surveillance can potentially be increased by estimating its performance for example decisions on whether to reduce organised surveillance in locations where citizen surveillance occurs requires performance information such as the geographic coverage and sensitivity of citizen surveillance to determine whether gaps in surveillance coverage exist estimates of citizen surveillance sensitivity and reporting likelihoods are also required to evaluate community support programs lloyd et al 2020 fritz et al 2019 killion et al 2018 pocock et al 2015 cappa et al 2018 such programs are typically aimed at increasing the sensitivity and reporting rates of citizen surveillance networks but it remains an open question whether such programs have been successful in sum to help governments determine how to make best use of citizen surveillance as an adjunct to organised surveillance it is necessary to understand the performance of citizen surveillance and the capacity to improve its performance a first step in evaluating the performance of citizen surveillance is to estimate its current impact on population management outcomes before estimating how this impact could potentially be enhanced through improved spatial targeting of organised surveillance and or through improved citizen surveillance support programs the focus of this study is on how to estimate the recent performance of citizen surveillance as a first step towards making best use of citizen surveillance as a management tool we estimate performance in terms of the impact of citizen reports on a population management program including the size of the population and the management actions taken over the analysis period estimating the impact of citizen reports on a population management program requires outcomes to be estimated in two scenarios 1 a counterfactual scenario of what would have happened in the absence of citizen reports and 2 a scenario that includes the reports the true scenario although counterfactuals are well established in ecology for estimating the impact of management activities baylis et al 2016 ribas et al 2021 they are rarely applied to estimate the impact of citizen surveillance this is a challenging problem because citizen surveillance impacts are largely indirect being dependent on the management actions undertaken as a consequence of citizen surveillance this implies that when citizen reports are excluded in the counterfactual scenario all linked management actions must also be excluded together with the population consequences of those excluded management actions for example if a citizen report of a threatened species triggers the establishment of a new or expanded protected area both the citizen report and the new protected area would need to be excluded in the counterfactual together with any subsequent population response to the management action a direct way to capture these chains of management and population consequences is to reconstruct the history of a population management program without citizen surveillance models of the dynamics of managed populations have extensively been used to predict their abundance and distribution under alternative management strategies but are less commonly used to estimate historical population dynamics however retrospective analyses can be a useful means for enhancing our understanding of the impacts of past management actions on population dynamics to inform adaptive management changes bayesian methods have been developed to reconstruct population dynamics based on observations made about the population over time and an historical record of management actions taken these previous analyses include invasive species applications keith and spring 2013 fukasawa et al 2013 and harvesting applications whitlock et al 2018 a logical next step in progressing our understanding of citizen surveillance performance is to reconstruct population management histories for which a record exists of citizen reports and to remove such reports from the reconstructed history for comparison with an estimate of the program s true history this is the approach taken in this analysis we apply our approach to a case study on an australian invasion of red imported fire ants solenopsis invicta since its discovery in 2001 the invasion has been the subject of an eradication campaign but has continued to expand keith and spring 2013 keith et al 2019 citizen reports have been made throughout the program but their impact on the outcome of the invasion has not previously been estimated 2 methods a convenient way to represent potentially complex cascades of effects arising from the exclusion of citizen surveillance in a counterfactual history involving linkages between citizen reports management actions and population dynamics is to represent this history as a graph that distinguishes these different forms of linkages edges this is the approach taken in this analysis our graph analysis builds on a previously developed agent based model of the fire ant invasion developed by keith and spring 2013 the model reconstructed the historical trajectory of the brisbane fire ant invasion using a hierarchical bayesian approach the invasion was modelled at the scale of individual fire ant nests as the agents the invasion was managed through a combination of activities including organised surveillance pesticide treatment applied directly into detected nests and broadcast application of a different pesticide that included an attractive bait to encourage the pesticide to be brought back to nests by foraging ants the modelling approach taken explicitly considered several sources of uncertainty about the locations and abundance of fire ant nests these include the limited efficacy of the control methods used i e imperfect treatment mortality and imperfect detectability with the surveillance methods used and the limited areas of application of the control methods i e only some potentially occupied locations were monitored or treated each year instead of a single map of fire ant nests the method produced many potential maps each consistent with the data provided by the invasion management agency on confirmed nest locations and the history of management actions each reconstructed fire ant history includes confirmed nest locations and unconfirmed yet credible locations of undetected nests based on their proximity to known nest locations the histories also include an unhindered expansion for 61 months before the first detection and subsequent search and treatment strategy using these histories we constructed possible graphs representing the relationships between the nests and control actions 2 1 the graph structure and graph generating algorithm three types of relationships between individuals of the managed population are considered in the graph fig 1 1 continued survival of an individual between successive time periods 2 reproduction i e a parent offspring relationship and 3 relationships mediated by a management intervention such as the removal of unwanted individuals or the protection of valued individuals together these capture the management changes induced by citizen reports this structure reflects how the value of citizen contributions for population management is derived from the beneficial cascade of management and population changes they induce the population unit we consider is a nest the historical data available in our case study included confirmed nest reports made by members of the public these reports trigger organised surveillance and treatment actions according to a known management protocol fig 2 these induced management actions may find and remove other nests the survival reproduction and management mediated relationships jobs between nests are represented in the graph by directed edges arrows from the node for a nest alive in month i to the node for the same nest alive in month i 1 the node for a parent nest alive in month i to a child nest it produces in month i the node for a nest which was detected in month i to the node for a nest which is consequently detected or terminated by a control action triggered by detection of the former nest examples of relationships between nests that are mediated by a management intervention include the termination of a nest with pesticide treatment and the detection of a nest with organised surveillance the historical record of management actions was made available for this analysis each graph represents an imputed invasion history on a monthly time scale the graph structure is built via the following steps 1 the graph is first populated with the nests that are alive each month linking the same nests that survive 2 for each new nest age 0 a credible parent nest is identified and linked to the nest 3 for each nest death the management job that could have caused the death is determined 4 for each nest death resulting from a prior detection subsequent management jobs in the surrounding area that could have been triggered by the detection are identified thus for each job there is a list of detected nests that could have triggered the job and a list of nests subsequently killed by the job the trigger nests are then linked to the killed nests on the graph fig 1 illustrates the approach taken to convert the real invasion history estimated using the method of keith and spring 2013 into the required graph format and associated jobs dictionary for estimating counterfactual histories as summarised in the figure caption the graph is first populated with all the nests that are alive each month linking the same nests that survive black lines in the figure new nests are then connected deterministically with mature nests in a child parent relationship by selecting the closest mature nest to be the parent nest blue lines for each nest death the management job that could have caused the death is identified the nest is then matched with the nearby relevant matching job that killed it as illustrated by red lines in fig 1 a nest can either be terminated by broadcast treatment without prior surveillance or by a combination of organised surveillance followed by treatment or as a consequence of a citizen detection followed by treatment the main difference between these three sources of nest termination is whether the nest was detected prior to being terminated nests can be terminated as a result of a treatment only action i e broadcast application of pesticide bait because the bait is taken by foraging ants to the nest without the invasion manager needing to know the precise nest location in contrast when a nest termination occurs as a direct consequence of the nest being detected this detection can trigger other management actions in addition to the termination of the nest these management actions are specified by the management protocol illustrated in fig 2 accordingly for each nest death resulting from a detection we identify later management jobs in the surrounding area that could have been triggered by that detection see fig 2 nests that triggered subsequent management actions are then linked to the killed nests on the graph pink lines in fig 1 an example of a linkage is between a nest detected by citizen surveillance and a nest terminated by a job triggered by the citizen report as already noted nests terminated without prior detection do not trigger any management actions whereas nests terminated as a consequence of being detected do trigger a management action to relate nests that triggered a management action to nests affected by that action operational rules followed by the invasion manager during the analysis period fig 2 were used to estimate credible management responses to nest detections based on this operational strategy surveillance that occurred within 100 m of a nest detected in the same or the following month was causally attributed to that detection similarly pesticide treatment within 500 m of a detection occurring in the same or following month was causally attributed to that detection these rules allow a management action to be attributed to more than one detection control actions that were not causally linked to any detection were retained and included in all counterfactual simulations fig 2 illustrates the management actions taken in the immediate vicinity of confirmed nests detected with citizen surveillance this figure applied over the entire period of analysis and does not include aerial remote sensing activities which occurred after the analysis period and only for research and development purposes rather than management purposes the completed graph structure contains information about all nests including founding date location date of detection type of detection jobs that affected the nest and jobs triggered by the nest the list of jobs also contains all relevant information about each management action including its dates coordinates date of detection type of detection jobs that affected the nest and jobs triggered by the nest 2 2 simulating a counterfactual history the first step in simulating a counterfactual history is to remove all citizen detections from the real invasion history this involves modifying the graph to reflect the causal consequences of removing citizen detections and management actions triggered by those detections the following graph algorithm applied sequentially every month starting from the earliest month was developed for this purpose 1 any nest detected by citizens in a given month is resurrected by converting its dead status to alive 2 any management action s triggered by the resurrected nest is removed thereby resurrecting additional nests that would have been killed by the management action 3 for any other new nests resurrected during this month repeat the above process of resurrecting each of them and removing triggered management actions and flow on events if a nest is to be resurrected in a later month this occurs during the next month s iteration of the algorithm 4 simulate the effects of management actions on the nests because old management actions have already been simulated on the original nests it is only necessary to consider whether any new management action will kill the original nests at an earlier date in contrast new nests will be affected by all management actions 5 any nests detected during organised search trigger new management actions in the immediate vicinity of the detections specifically treatment and search in the following month thereafter treatment without search occurs according to the protocol used during the invasion s history fig 2 6 all nests subsequently affected by a management action are killed we traverse down the graph for any nests that are killed earlier than the original invasion history removing any child nests they would have had as well as removing any related trigger actions this can lead to nests being resurrected later in the counterfactual history as specified in steps 2 3 7 for any new nests that are still alive a new node is added to the graph for the following month any new nests that have reached maturity age 8 months or more have a probability to generating new child nests which are then also added to the graph a management action can have multiple triggers and therefore such an action is only completely removed once all of its triggers are removed the completion of these steps produces a new fire ant nest graph and a new set of jobs which is a counterfactual history the steps of the counterfactual simulation algorithm are illustrated in figs 3 5 in steps 3 and 4 fig 4 we simulate the potential termination of the nest by any control action from the real invasion or a new control action this is achieved by checking every action in the vicinity of the nest such that the nest can only be affected by one action of each management type organised surveillance and broadcast treatment in the same month where both search and treatment actions occurred search is simulated prior to treatment to be consistent with the timing of actions considered in the invasion reconstruction model keith and spring 2013 nests terminated without prior detection are removed without triggering new control actions whereas nests that are detected do trigger new control actions within a specific radius around detection points these triggered surveillance and treatment actions are simulated in the month immediately following the nest detection these actions include five rounds of treatment one every four months provided that no treatment occurred in that area in the prior three months if a nest is prematurely detected or killed by broadcast treatment without prior detection this precipitates a cascade of effects in particular the nest can no longer give rise to progeny later in the counterfactual history nor can it trigger later management actions any later progeny nests are thus also removed as well as any later trigger actions and this is repeated for all deleted nests fig 4 in step 5 of the counterfactual algorithm fig 5 reproduction is simulated for any mature surviving nests the simulation of nest founding events makes use of parameter distributions estimated with the model of keith and spring 2013 if the surviving nests are immature they survive without reproducing to generate counterfactual invasion histories the simulation component of the algorithm considers all events that influence and are influenced by the new nests resulting from the removal of citizen detections the new nests are subject to control actions that occurred in the imputed history and new control actions caused by the detection of a new nest that occur in their proximity new nests that are remote from a control action or that avoid detection and termination within a controlled area survive from one period month to the next and may produce offspring if they are mature as noted earlier new control actions could potentially terminate nests earlier than their date of termination in the imputed history this leads to a cascade of effects the ants graph and jobs list are continually updated throughout the simulation process new nests or jobs are added and old nests or management actions are removed if they no longer exist in the counterfactual history 2 3 citizen surveillance performance measures performance measures were estimated for two different counterfactual scenarios in the first scenario the original management strategy was applied fig 2 and the counterfactual invasion spreads further than the real invasion because of the absence of citizen reports the additional area occupied by the invasion in this scenario was measured by the occupied area enclosed by a non convex polygon estimated using the method of keith et al 2019 in the second scenario an increased area of surveillance and treatment is applied around confirmed nest points to compensate for the absence of citizen surveillance in this scenario the additional cost of managing the invasion was estimated as the cost of applying the minimum additional management area required to achieve a high probability of preventing the invasion expanding in area 2 4 data and implementation both the original data and the code are available as part of the supplementary material the following data on the invasion were obtained from the invasion management agency a record of fire ant nest locations and dates of nest detections made with organised surveillance and citizen surveillance respectively a record of the organised control actions surveillance and treatment taken these records collected by the fire ant management agency biosecurity queensland contains citizen and agency detections and the control actions but do not explicitly specify causal relationships between detections and control actions we estimated the invasion s causal structure based on the known control strategy applied during the invasion s history fig 2 as part of the graph generation process this allowed us to link nests to control actions plausibly triggered by detection of those nests within the context of this work the reconstructed histories produced via the method of keith and spring 2013 could also be considered part of the input data as noted earlier the approach of keith and spring 2013 generates potential histories of the fire ant invasion consistent with the historical data the reconstructed histories contain the following information the number of undetected individuals nests founded during the course of the invasion their map coordinates and whether they were killed via broadcast treatment or were extant at the end of the period modelled and dates of death if killed a founding date for each nest both detected and undetected we selected 50 of these reconstructed histories as starting points for constructing counterfactuals to illustrate our method and we quantified the variability due to the choice of imputed history one counterfactual simulation was conducted per imputed history and the distribution of outcomes for the counterfactual invasion was compared to the distribution of outcomes for the imputed invasion history we removed citizen reports from each imputed history together with the management actions and pest detections triggered by those reports and then simulated invasion spread and management actions in this counterfactual scenario for comparison with the real invasion history the graph construction and counterfactual algorithms were implemented in python supplementary material the parameters used in the counterfactual are given in table 1 our code supplementary material first creates a graph showing a potential family structure then for each different set of scenarios we consider the code steps through time and modifies the graph structure as some nests survive and create new children while other nests die early the subsequent output includes the list of jobs management action in the counterfactual a list of all nests with their coordinates date of founding date of death and detection type and the counterfactual graph structure from this output we calculate the performance measures i e the polygon bounding the invasion and its area 3 results 3 1 additional invasion spread without citizen reports the original total number of nests and estimated changes in population in absence of citizen surveillance is given in fig 6 in the original history the invasion was almost eradicated by april 2004 but in the absence of citizen surveillance this would not have been the case the estimated changes in the invasion s geographic extent between its discovery in 2001 and april 2004 are illustrated in fig 7 fig 7 illustrates a large estimated increase in the invasion s geographic extent without citizen reports and with an unchanged radius of search and treatment around confirmed nest points the percentage difference in invasion area between the counterfactual and real history is illustrated in fig 8 in the form of a reverse cumulative distribution function the increase in invasion area in the counterfactual history is an estimate of the reduction in area attributable to citizen surveillance when there is no compensating increase in management effort r1 and r2 in fig 2 remain unchanged compared with the real history the vertical axis of fig 8 represents the proportion of the 50 counterfactual histories corresponding to the relevant invasion size increase larger geographic extents at the end of the counterfactual history are associated with a smaller likelihood of occurrence the figure illustrates that without citizen surveillance there is at least a 90 likelihood that the invasion would have occupied an area at least twice as large i e a 90 likelihood of the area being at least 100 larger the economic benefit attributable to citizen reports is the avoided economic human health and environmental losses that would have occurred without the reports this can be estimated with spatially explicit data on the assets and communities at risk of harm from fire ants e g rolfe and windle 2014 combined with spatially explicit estimates of the area occupied by the invasion in the counterfactual history as produced by this analysis 3 2 additional management effort required to contain the invasion without citizen reports to prevent the invasion expanding in area in the absence of citizen reports additional management effort is required this was modelled by increasing the management radius around confirmed nest points made by organised surveillance in the absence of citizen reports several different management radii were considered in different counterfactual scenarios ranging from 0 1 km to 5 km the smallest of these radii that achieved a high likelihood of preventing expansion of the invasion s geographic extent was 0 5 km results are presented for this scenario fig 9 illustrates that there is approximately an 80 likelihood that the invasion would have declined in area when a distance of 0 5 km is searched and treated around confirmed nest points in the absence of citizen reports fig 10 illustrates the reduction in invaded area and the reduction in uncertainty about the extent of the invasion when management effort around confirmed nest points is increased from the original radius of 0 1 km 0 5 km fig 11 compares the average areas searched and treated in the counterfactual and real invasion histories the latter is taken from the official record of invasion management actions the additional management area in the counterfactual history can be used to estimate the additional management cost that would have occurred without citizen surveillance the cost of treatment was approximately 200 ha and the cost of organised ground surveillance was approximately 250 ha ross wylie science leader national red imported fire ant eradication program pers com at these per hectare management costs the areas searched and treated in the counterfactual scenario would have cost approximately 285 million more than in the real history 4 discussion the capacity to make empirical estimates of the value of citizen surveillance in supporting population management programs has been hindered by methodological challenges in estimating counterfactuals where citizen reported data are not available to program managers a key challenge is accounting for the interdependent nature of citizen surveillance management and population dynamics when excluding citizen reports from the counterfactual scenario we addressed this challenge by reconstructing the dynamics of a managed population for which a full historical record was available of the dates and locations of citizen reports we represented the population management history as a graph that captured the key relationships between citizen reports population dynamics and management actions this allowed us to estimate counterfactual histories of what could have happened if citizen reporting was absent as a basis for estimating its contribution to management outcomes these contributions were measured in terms that related to the overarching management aim of eventually eradicating the invasion we reported the geographic extent of the invasion and the number of invasive individuals within that area we found that the invasion would have been both larger in extent and in population size in the absence of citizen reports a strength of the agent based counterfactual method is its capacity to estimate the cascade of effects flowing from small changes including changes triggered by an absence of citizen reports another strength of our analysis is our development of a method for disentangling citizen reports from interdependent management actions and population changes such interdependence adds substantially to the complexity of counterfactual history estimation and requires a computationally tractable and readily understood analysis method prior to this study there had been a general lack of tractable computational methods for estimating the impacts of events or actions that affect other events e g population growth or actions e g active surveillance graph theoretical methods are a transparent and computationally convenient way to consider such interdependencies the main constraint on future applications of our method and counterfactual history methods more generally is the availability of suitable data public management agencies do not always state explicitly how they would respond to information provided by private citizens but this information is needed to estimate the impacts of citizen surveillance because these impacts largely depend on how they influence management to conduct our analysis we used data provided by the population management agency on the locations and dates of nest detections and management actions as well as information on the rules followed by the agency for determining what management actions were taken in the immediate vicinity of confirmed detections made by citizens however there are other management responses to citizen detections that were not considered due to a lack of data for example the management agency defines an administrative boundary for the invasion that is expanded when new detections are made beyond the existing boundary including detections made by private citizens to estimate the impact of any such boundary changes triggered by citizen detections it would be necessary to understand how the boundary would change which was not explicitly stated by the program even if this were known additional information would be needed on the likely impacts of these changes in the administrative boundary one such potential impact may arise from a restriction on human movements of material that could transport fire ants within the administrative boundary estimation of the impacts of this restriction on fire ant spread would require a more detailed counterfactual analysis that includes an estimate of the likelihood of human assisted movements of fire ants this example highlights the potential complexity of interactions between citizen surveillance and particular management activities such as movement restrictions the greater complexity of these relationships imply a need for additional data which may affect the feasibility of estimating particular forms of citizen surveillance impacts however these challenges should not prevent counterfactual analyses of more readily estimated impacts of citizen surveillance this reflects that even an incomplete analysis of citizen surveillance impacts may provide compelling evidence on the question of whether citizen surveillance impacts are beneficial for example if our analysis excluded the impact of citizen reports on improved estimation of the invasion s administrative boundary which in turn reduced spread of the invasion our analysis would have underestimated the impact of citizen reports in slowing the invasion s spread this supports our finding that citizen surveillance was beneficial which is a necessary but not sufficient condition for continuing to support citizen surveillance with community engagement programs counterfactual history analysis of citizen surveillance is enhanced by the use of population models that estimate population dynamics at a scale relevant for understanding management impacts this allows for questions to be addressed such as what would happen if a particular nest were not detected in the present study we combined information on management rules with previously estimated parameters of invader population dynamics made with a stochastic agent based model abm although abms are well suited to estimating citizen surveillance impacts at the fine scales at which citizen detections are made and management responses occur they can have a large computational cost in comparison with simpler methods such as a set of coupled equations this highlights a need to explore simpler methods for statistical calibration of abms that have smaller computational costs such as particle filtering kattwinkel and reichert 2017 and approximate bayesian computation sirén et al 2018 alternatively simplifying assumptions can be made with more computationally demanding methods such as the method applied in the present study one of these assumptions was that all child nests form close to their parent nest this excluded from the analysis the possibility that a small proportion of nests formed as a consequence of a long distance movement of reproductive ants suarez et al 2001 excluding this possibility has a range of potential implications including the possibility that localised clusters of infestation typical of stratified diffusion processes shigesada et al 1995 appear near the boundary it is unclear how our simplifying assumption about the sources of new nests would influence the estimated benefit of citizen surveillance on the one hand citizen detections could potentially prevent geographic range expanding long distance movements but if such movements occur frequently enough they could render any control efforts ineffective reducing the contribution of citizen reports against this ambiguous effect of excluding long distance movements and the lack of data for estimating this effect is a known large computational cost of relaxing our assumption about the distance between parent nests and child nests for example in the counterfactual simulations there were many months in which there were more than 100 mature nests even if only a single new child nest was produced in the 8 months required for the nest to become reproductively mature there would be at least 1008 different graphs a combinatorial explosion simplifying approaches would need to be investigated including for example the selection of potential parent nests from a region or within a radius of 1 km or from among the five closest potential parent nests repeating this procedure would result in multiple different possible graphs an important question for further development of our approach is to explicitly consider the impacts of citizen reports on population range delimitation which is necessary in conservation harvesting and control applications the development of new population range delimitation methods is an active focus of research e g keith et al 2019 another important question for future research is to estimate the extent to which citizen surveillance contributions are attributable to past citizen support measures addressing this question requires an historical record of community support measures and a method for estimating the impact of these measures on citizen reporting however even without such information the method developed in this study can be used to assess whether a citizen support program should be re evaluated to justify its continued operation this would be true if citizen reporting impacts on the population of interest were estimated to be smaller than expected this is unlikely in the case study considered given that citizen reports were estimated to have substantially improved population management outcomes however it remains an open question whether the expenditures made on citizen support measures were justified by improved management outcomes another open question is whether changed citizen support measures would be beneficial the impact of citizen reports depends on where and when the reports are made which can potentially be influenced by the timing and spatial targeting of community engagement programs aimed at enhancing citizen surveillance an improved understanding of how and where citizen surveillance has the most impact and which citizen groups are most readily prepared to assist government agencies can underpin enhanced community engagement programs that produce larger benefits 5 conclusions given its low cost and broad geographic coverage citizen surveillance has the potential to make substantial contributions to the management of wild populations silvertown 2009 to make best use of citizen surveillance as an adjunct to organised surveillance its performance needs to be estimated counterfactual analysis can be used for this purpose and thereby provide a rigorous empirical basis for optimising the contribution of citizen surveillance to conservation harvesting and control programs reconstructions of populations histories represented as a graph offers a promising approach to estimate counterfactuals for citizen surveillance support programs and thereby help

24312,reconstructions of population histories can shed light on the impact of citizen surveillance on managed populations this can inform efforts to make best use of citizen surveillance as an alternative or complement to organised surveillance by public agencies in conservation sustainable harvesting and control programs we reconstructed the history of an invasive population of red imported fire ants solenopsis invicta and the management actions taken to eradicate the population some of which were influenced by citizen reports the invasion histories were represented as a graph that considered relationships between citizen reports invader population dynamics and management actions we estimated that citizen reports slowed the invasion s spread and or reduced the cost of containment our approach can readily be extended to estimate the impact of citizen surveillance support programs and thereby provide a rigorous empirical basis for the design of such programs keywords citizen surveillance impact evaluation counterfactual valuation data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction the voluntary provision of information by private citizens citizen surveillance has become one of the main sources of information on many wild populations reflecting the high cost of organised surveillance by public agencies for example the australasian fishes project has collected over 66 000 citizen observations in less than 3 years kelly et al 2020 and citizen reports comprise a large proportion of the detections recorded in australia s primary wildlife database the atlas of living australia pecl et al 2015 despite the large number of observations made by private citizens on managed populations there is a general lack of empirical evidence on the contribution of citizen surveillance to population management outcomes instead a more common focus of analysis has been on estimating the contribution of citizen surveillance data for research rather than management purposes these are very different uses of citizen surveillance data when used to conduct research citizen surveillance data can facilitate improved inferences about species distributions la sorte and somveille 2020 including changes in distributions over time neate clegg et al 2020 and anthropogenic influences on those changes sherbinin et al 2021 although these research findings are of general interest they may provide only limited guidance on how to make best use of citizen surveillance to address a current population management problem in this context citizen surveillance can potentially improve program outcomes in conservation harvesting and control programs by replacing and or augmenting organised surveillance by public agencies these beneficial contributions of citizen surveillance include reduced management costs when citizen surveillance replaces higher cost organised surveillance activities and improved management effectiveness when citizen detections occur in locations where organised surveillance would not have occurred these gains in management effectiveness can be reflected in larger populations of threatened species lloyd et al 2020 larger sustainable harvests of harvested species and avoided commercial and amenity losses from earlier detection of invasive species epanchin niell et al 2021 caley et al 2020 the management benefits of citizen surveillance can potentially be increased by estimating its performance for example decisions on whether to reduce organised surveillance in locations where citizen surveillance occurs requires performance information such as the geographic coverage and sensitivity of citizen surveillance to determine whether gaps in surveillance coverage exist estimates of citizen surveillance sensitivity and reporting likelihoods are also required to evaluate community support programs lloyd et al 2020 fritz et al 2019 killion et al 2018 pocock et al 2015 cappa et al 2018 such programs are typically aimed at increasing the sensitivity and reporting rates of citizen surveillance networks but it remains an open question whether such programs have been successful in sum to help governments determine how to make best use of citizen surveillance as an adjunct to organised surveillance it is necessary to understand the performance of citizen surveillance and the capacity to improve its performance a first step in evaluating the performance of citizen surveillance is to estimate its current impact on population management outcomes before estimating how this impact could potentially be enhanced through improved spatial targeting of organised surveillance and or through improved citizen surveillance support programs the focus of this study is on how to estimate the recent performance of citizen surveillance as a first step towards making best use of citizen surveillance as a management tool we estimate performance in terms of the impact of citizen reports on a population management program including the size of the population and the management actions taken over the analysis period estimating the impact of citizen reports on a population management program requires outcomes to be estimated in two scenarios 1 a counterfactual scenario of what would have happened in the absence of citizen reports and 2 a scenario that includes the reports the true scenario although counterfactuals are well established in ecology for estimating the impact of management activities baylis et al 2016 ribas et al 2021 they are rarely applied to estimate the impact of citizen surveillance this is a challenging problem because citizen surveillance impacts are largely indirect being dependent on the management actions undertaken as a consequence of citizen surveillance this implies that when citizen reports are excluded in the counterfactual scenario all linked management actions must also be excluded together with the population consequences of those excluded management actions for example if a citizen report of a threatened species triggers the establishment of a new or expanded protected area both the citizen report and the new protected area would need to be excluded in the counterfactual together with any subsequent population response to the management action a direct way to capture these chains of management and population consequences is to reconstruct the history of a population management program without citizen surveillance models of the dynamics of managed populations have extensively been used to predict their abundance and distribution under alternative management strategies but are less commonly used to estimate historical population dynamics however retrospective analyses can be a useful means for enhancing our understanding of the impacts of past management actions on population dynamics to inform adaptive management changes bayesian methods have been developed to reconstruct population dynamics based on observations made about the population over time and an historical record of management actions taken these previous analyses include invasive species applications keith and spring 2013 fukasawa et al 2013 and harvesting applications whitlock et al 2018 a logical next step in progressing our understanding of citizen surveillance performance is to reconstruct population management histories for which a record exists of citizen reports and to remove such reports from the reconstructed history for comparison with an estimate of the program s true history this is the approach taken in this analysis we apply our approach to a case study on an australian invasion of red imported fire ants solenopsis invicta since its discovery in 2001 the invasion has been the subject of an eradication campaign but has continued to expand keith and spring 2013 keith et al 2019 citizen reports have been made throughout the program but their impact on the outcome of the invasion has not previously been estimated 2 methods a convenient way to represent potentially complex cascades of effects arising from the exclusion of citizen surveillance in a counterfactual history involving linkages between citizen reports management actions and population dynamics is to represent this history as a graph that distinguishes these different forms of linkages edges this is the approach taken in this analysis our graph analysis builds on a previously developed agent based model of the fire ant invasion developed by keith and spring 2013 the model reconstructed the historical trajectory of the brisbane fire ant invasion using a hierarchical bayesian approach the invasion was modelled at the scale of individual fire ant nests as the agents the invasion was managed through a combination of activities including organised surveillance pesticide treatment applied directly into detected nests and broadcast application of a different pesticide that included an attractive bait to encourage the pesticide to be brought back to nests by foraging ants the modelling approach taken explicitly considered several sources of uncertainty about the locations and abundance of fire ant nests these include the limited efficacy of the control methods used i e imperfect treatment mortality and imperfect detectability with the surveillance methods used and the limited areas of application of the control methods i e only some potentially occupied locations were monitored or treated each year instead of a single map of fire ant nests the method produced many potential maps each consistent with the data provided by the invasion management agency on confirmed nest locations and the history of management actions each reconstructed fire ant history includes confirmed nest locations and unconfirmed yet credible locations of undetected nests based on their proximity to known nest locations the histories also include an unhindered expansion for 61 months before the first detection and subsequent search and treatment strategy using these histories we constructed possible graphs representing the relationships between the nests and control actions 2 1 the graph structure and graph generating algorithm three types of relationships between individuals of the managed population are considered in the graph fig 1 1 continued survival of an individual between successive time periods 2 reproduction i e a parent offspring relationship and 3 relationships mediated by a management intervention such as the removal of unwanted individuals or the protection of valued individuals together these capture the management changes induced by citizen reports this structure reflects how the value of citizen contributions for population management is derived from the beneficial cascade of management and population changes they induce the population unit we consider is a nest the historical data available in our case study included confirmed nest reports made by members of the public these reports trigger organised surveillance and treatment actions according to a known management protocol fig 2 these induced management actions may find and remove other nests the survival reproduction and management mediated relationships jobs between nests are represented in the graph by directed edges arrows from the node for a nest alive in month i to the node for the same nest alive in month i 1 the node for a parent nest alive in month i to a child nest it produces in month i the node for a nest which was detected in month i to the node for a nest which is consequently detected or terminated by a control action triggered by detection of the former nest examples of relationships between nests that are mediated by a management intervention include the termination of a nest with pesticide treatment and the detection of a nest with organised surveillance the historical record of management actions was made available for this analysis each graph represents an imputed invasion history on a monthly time scale the graph structure is built via the following steps 1 the graph is first populated with the nests that are alive each month linking the same nests that survive 2 for each new nest age 0 a credible parent nest is identified and linked to the nest 3 for each nest death the management job that could have caused the death is determined 4 for each nest death resulting from a prior detection subsequent management jobs in the surrounding area that could have been triggered by the detection are identified thus for each job there is a list of detected nests that could have triggered the job and a list of nests subsequently killed by the job the trigger nests are then linked to the killed nests on the graph fig 1 illustrates the approach taken to convert the real invasion history estimated using the method of keith and spring 2013 into the required graph format and associated jobs dictionary for estimating counterfactual histories as summarised in the figure caption the graph is first populated with all the nests that are alive each month linking the same nests that survive black lines in the figure new nests are then connected deterministically with mature nests in a child parent relationship by selecting the closest mature nest to be the parent nest blue lines for each nest death the management job that could have caused the death is identified the nest is then matched with the nearby relevant matching job that killed it as illustrated by red lines in fig 1 a nest can either be terminated by broadcast treatment without prior surveillance or by a combination of organised surveillance followed by treatment or as a consequence of a citizen detection followed by treatment the main difference between these three sources of nest termination is whether the nest was detected prior to being terminated nests can be terminated as a result of a treatment only action i e broadcast application of pesticide bait because the bait is taken by foraging ants to the nest without the invasion manager needing to know the precise nest location in contrast when a nest termination occurs as a direct consequence of the nest being detected this detection can trigger other management actions in addition to the termination of the nest these management actions are specified by the management protocol illustrated in fig 2 accordingly for each nest death resulting from a detection we identify later management jobs in the surrounding area that could have been triggered by that detection see fig 2 nests that triggered subsequent management actions are then linked to the killed nests on the graph pink lines in fig 1 an example of a linkage is between a nest detected by citizen surveillance and a nest terminated by a job triggered by the citizen report as already noted nests terminated without prior detection do not trigger any management actions whereas nests terminated as a consequence of being detected do trigger a management action to relate nests that triggered a management action to nests affected by that action operational rules followed by the invasion manager during the analysis period fig 2 were used to estimate credible management responses to nest detections based on this operational strategy surveillance that occurred within 100 m of a nest detected in the same or the following month was causally attributed to that detection similarly pesticide treatment within 500 m of a detection occurring in the same or following month was causally attributed to that detection these rules allow a management action to be attributed to more than one detection control actions that were not causally linked to any detection were retained and included in all counterfactual simulations fig 2 illustrates the management actions taken in the immediate vicinity of confirmed nests detected with citizen surveillance this figure applied over the entire period of analysis and does not include aerial remote sensing activities which occurred after the analysis period and only for research and development purposes rather than management purposes the completed graph structure contains information about all nests including founding date location date of detection type of detection jobs that affected the nest and jobs triggered by the nest the list of jobs also contains all relevant information about each management action including its dates coordinates date of detection type of detection jobs that affected the nest and jobs triggered by the nest 2 2 simulating a counterfactual history the first step in simulating a counterfactual history is to remove all citizen detections from the real invasion history this involves modifying the graph to reflect the causal consequences of removing citizen detections and management actions triggered by those detections the following graph algorithm applied sequentially every month starting from the earliest month was developed for this purpose 1 any nest detected by citizens in a given month is resurrected by converting its dead status to alive 2 any management action s triggered by the resurrected nest is removed thereby resurrecting additional nests that would have been killed by the management action 3 for any other new nests resurrected during this month repeat the above process of resurrecting each of them and removing triggered management actions and flow on events if a nest is to be resurrected in a later month this occurs during the next month s iteration of the algorithm 4 simulate the effects of management actions on the nests because old management actions have already been simulated on the original nests it is only necessary to consider whether any new management action will kill the original nests at an earlier date in contrast new nests will be affected by all management actions 5 any nests detected during organised search trigger new management actions in the immediate vicinity of the detections specifically treatment and search in the following month thereafter treatment without search occurs according to the protocol used during the invasion s history fig 2 6 all nests subsequently affected by a management action are killed we traverse down the graph for any nests that are killed earlier than the original invasion history removing any child nests they would have had as well as removing any related trigger actions this can lead to nests being resurrected later in the counterfactual history as specified in steps 2 3 7 for any new nests that are still alive a new node is added to the graph for the following month any new nests that have reached maturity age 8 months or more have a probability to generating new child nests which are then also added to the graph a management action can have multiple triggers and therefore such an action is only completely removed once all of its triggers are removed the completion of these steps produces a new fire ant nest graph and a new set of jobs which is a counterfactual history the steps of the counterfactual simulation algorithm are illustrated in figs 3 5 in steps 3 and 4 fig 4 we simulate the potential termination of the nest by any control action from the real invasion or a new control action this is achieved by checking every action in the vicinity of the nest such that the nest can only be affected by one action of each management type organised surveillance and broadcast treatment in the same month where both search and treatment actions occurred search is simulated prior to treatment to be consistent with the timing of actions considered in the invasion reconstruction model keith and spring 2013 nests terminated without prior detection are removed without triggering new control actions whereas nests that are detected do trigger new control actions within a specific radius around detection points these triggered surveillance and treatment actions are simulated in the month immediately following the nest detection these actions include five rounds of treatment one every four months provided that no treatment occurred in that area in the prior three months if a nest is prematurely detected or killed by broadcast treatment without prior detection this precipitates a cascade of effects in particular the nest can no longer give rise to progeny later in the counterfactual history nor can it trigger later management actions any later progeny nests are thus also removed as well as any later trigger actions and this is repeated for all deleted nests fig 4 in step 5 of the counterfactual algorithm fig 5 reproduction is simulated for any mature surviving nests the simulation of nest founding events makes use of parameter distributions estimated with the model of keith and spring 2013 if the surviving nests are immature they survive without reproducing to generate counterfactual invasion histories the simulation component of the algorithm considers all events that influence and are influenced by the new nests resulting from the removal of citizen detections the new nests are subject to control actions that occurred in the imputed history and new control actions caused by the detection of a new nest that occur in their proximity new nests that are remote from a control action or that avoid detection and termination within a controlled area survive from one period month to the next and may produce offspring if they are mature as noted earlier new control actions could potentially terminate nests earlier than their date of termination in the imputed history this leads to a cascade of effects the ants graph and jobs list are continually updated throughout the simulation process new nests or jobs are added and old nests or management actions are removed if they no longer exist in the counterfactual history 2 3 citizen surveillance performance measures performance measures were estimated for two different counterfactual scenarios in the first scenario the original management strategy was applied fig 2 and the counterfactual invasion spreads further than the real invasion because of the absence of citizen reports the additional area occupied by the invasion in this scenario was measured by the occupied area enclosed by a non convex polygon estimated using the method of keith et al 2019 in the second scenario an increased area of surveillance and treatment is applied around confirmed nest points to compensate for the absence of citizen surveillance in this scenario the additional cost of managing the invasion was estimated as the cost of applying the minimum additional management area required to achieve a high probability of preventing the invasion expanding in area 2 4 data and implementation both the original data and the code are available as part of the supplementary material the following data on the invasion were obtained from the invasion management agency a record of fire ant nest locations and dates of nest detections made with organised surveillance and citizen surveillance respectively a record of the organised control actions surveillance and treatment taken these records collected by the fire ant management agency biosecurity queensland contains citizen and agency detections and the control actions but do not explicitly specify causal relationships between detections and control actions we estimated the invasion s causal structure based on the known control strategy applied during the invasion s history fig 2 as part of the graph generation process this allowed us to link nests to control actions plausibly triggered by detection of those nests within the context of this work the reconstructed histories produced via the method of keith and spring 2013 could also be considered part of the input data as noted earlier the approach of keith and spring 2013 generates potential histories of the fire ant invasion consistent with the historical data the reconstructed histories contain the following information the number of undetected individuals nests founded during the course of the invasion their map coordinates and whether they were killed via broadcast treatment or were extant at the end of the period modelled and dates of death if killed a founding date for each nest both detected and undetected we selected 50 of these reconstructed histories as starting points for constructing counterfactuals to illustrate our method and we quantified the variability due to the choice of imputed history one counterfactual simulation was conducted per imputed history and the distribution of outcomes for the counterfactual invasion was compared to the distribution of outcomes for the imputed invasion history we removed citizen reports from each imputed history together with the management actions and pest detections triggered by those reports and then simulated invasion spread and management actions in this counterfactual scenario for comparison with the real invasion history the graph construction and counterfactual algorithms were implemented in python supplementary material the parameters used in the counterfactual are given in table 1 our code supplementary material first creates a graph showing a potential family structure then for each different set of scenarios we consider the code steps through time and modifies the graph structure as some nests survive and create new children while other nests die early the subsequent output includes the list of jobs management action in the counterfactual a list of all nests with their coordinates date of founding date of death and detection type and the counterfactual graph structure from this output we calculate the performance measures i e the polygon bounding the invasion and its area 3 results 3 1 additional invasion spread without citizen reports the original total number of nests and estimated changes in population in absence of citizen surveillance is given in fig 6 in the original history the invasion was almost eradicated by april 2004 but in the absence of citizen surveillance this would not have been the case the estimated changes in the invasion s geographic extent between its discovery in 2001 and april 2004 are illustrated in fig 7 fig 7 illustrates a large estimated increase in the invasion s geographic extent without citizen reports and with an unchanged radius of search and treatment around confirmed nest points the percentage difference in invasion area between the counterfactual and real history is illustrated in fig 8 in the form of a reverse cumulative distribution function the increase in invasion area in the counterfactual history is an estimate of the reduction in area attributable to citizen surveillance when there is no compensating increase in management effort r1 and r2 in fig 2 remain unchanged compared with the real history the vertical axis of fig 8 represents the proportion of the 50 counterfactual histories corresponding to the relevant invasion size increase larger geographic extents at the end of the counterfactual history are associated with a smaller likelihood of occurrence the figure illustrates that without citizen surveillance there is at least a 90 likelihood that the invasion would have occupied an area at least twice as large i e a 90 likelihood of the area being at least 100 larger the economic benefit attributable to citizen reports is the avoided economic human health and environmental losses that would have occurred without the reports this can be estimated with spatially explicit data on the assets and communities at risk of harm from fire ants e g rolfe and windle 2014 combined with spatially explicit estimates of the area occupied by the invasion in the counterfactual history as produced by this analysis 3 2 additional management effort required to contain the invasion without citizen reports to prevent the invasion expanding in area in the absence of citizen reports additional management effort is required this was modelled by increasing the management radius around confirmed nest points made by organised surveillance in the absence of citizen reports several different management radii were considered in different counterfactual scenarios ranging from 0 1 km to 5 km the smallest of these radii that achieved a high likelihood of preventing expansion of the invasion s geographic extent was 0 5 km results are presented for this scenario fig 9 illustrates that there is approximately an 80 likelihood that the invasion would have declined in area when a distance of 0 5 km is searched and treated around confirmed nest points in the absence of citizen reports fig 10 illustrates the reduction in invaded area and the reduction in uncertainty about the extent of the invasion when management effort around confirmed nest points is increased from the original radius of 0 1 km 0 5 km fig 11 compares the average areas searched and treated in the counterfactual and real invasion histories the latter is taken from the official record of invasion management actions the additional management area in the counterfactual history can be used to estimate the additional management cost that would have occurred without citizen surveillance the cost of treatment was approximately 200 ha and the cost of organised ground surveillance was approximately 250 ha ross wylie science leader national red imported fire ant eradication program pers com at these per hectare management costs the areas searched and treated in the counterfactual scenario would have cost approximately 285 million more than in the real history 4 discussion the capacity to make empirical estimates of the value of citizen surveillance in supporting population management programs has been hindered by methodological challenges in estimating counterfactuals where citizen reported data are not available to program managers a key challenge is accounting for the interdependent nature of citizen surveillance management and population dynamics when excluding citizen reports from the counterfactual scenario we addressed this challenge by reconstructing the dynamics of a managed population for which a full historical record was available of the dates and locations of citizen reports we represented the population management history as a graph that captured the key relationships between citizen reports population dynamics and management actions this allowed us to estimate counterfactual histories of what could have happened if citizen reporting was absent as a basis for estimating its contribution to management outcomes these contributions were measured in terms that related to the overarching management aim of eventually eradicating the invasion we reported the geographic extent of the invasion and the number of invasive individuals within that area we found that the invasion would have been both larger in extent and in population size in the absence of citizen reports a strength of the agent based counterfactual method is its capacity to estimate the cascade of effects flowing from small changes including changes triggered by an absence of citizen reports another strength of our analysis is our development of a method for disentangling citizen reports from interdependent management actions and population changes such interdependence adds substantially to the complexity of counterfactual history estimation and requires a computationally tractable and readily understood analysis method prior to this study there had been a general lack of tractable computational methods for estimating the impacts of events or actions that affect other events e g population growth or actions e g active surveillance graph theoretical methods are a transparent and computationally convenient way to consider such interdependencies the main constraint on future applications of our method and counterfactual history methods more generally is the availability of suitable data public management agencies do not always state explicitly how they would respond to information provided by private citizens but this information is needed to estimate the impacts of citizen surveillance because these impacts largely depend on how they influence management to conduct our analysis we used data provided by the population management agency on the locations and dates of nest detections and management actions as well as information on the rules followed by the agency for determining what management actions were taken in the immediate vicinity of confirmed detections made by citizens however there are other management responses to citizen detections that were not considered due to a lack of data for example the management agency defines an administrative boundary for the invasion that is expanded when new detections are made beyond the existing boundary including detections made by private citizens to estimate the impact of any such boundary changes triggered by citizen detections it would be necessary to understand how the boundary would change which was not explicitly stated by the program even if this were known additional information would be needed on the likely impacts of these changes in the administrative boundary one such potential impact may arise from a restriction on human movements of material that could transport fire ants within the administrative boundary estimation of the impacts of this restriction on fire ant spread would require a more detailed counterfactual analysis that includes an estimate of the likelihood of human assisted movements of fire ants this example highlights the potential complexity of interactions between citizen surveillance and particular management activities such as movement restrictions the greater complexity of these relationships imply a need for additional data which may affect the feasibility of estimating particular forms of citizen surveillance impacts however these challenges should not prevent counterfactual analyses of more readily estimated impacts of citizen surveillance this reflects that even an incomplete analysis of citizen surveillance impacts may provide compelling evidence on the question of whether citizen surveillance impacts are beneficial for example if our analysis excluded the impact of citizen reports on improved estimation of the invasion s administrative boundary which in turn reduced spread of the invasion our analysis would have underestimated the impact of citizen reports in slowing the invasion s spread this supports our finding that citizen surveillance was beneficial which is a necessary but not sufficient condition for continuing to support citizen surveillance with community engagement programs counterfactual history analysis of citizen surveillance is enhanced by the use of population models that estimate population dynamics at a scale relevant for understanding management impacts this allows for questions to be addressed such as what would happen if a particular nest were not detected in the present study we combined information on management rules with previously estimated parameters of invader population dynamics made with a stochastic agent based model abm although abms are well suited to estimating citizen surveillance impacts at the fine scales at which citizen detections are made and management responses occur they can have a large computational cost in comparison with simpler methods such as a set of coupled equations this highlights a need to explore simpler methods for statistical calibration of abms that have smaller computational costs such as particle filtering kattwinkel and reichert 2017 and approximate bayesian computation sirén et al 2018 alternatively simplifying assumptions can be made with more computationally demanding methods such as the method applied in the present study one of these assumptions was that all child nests form close to their parent nest this excluded from the analysis the possibility that a small proportion of nests formed as a consequence of a long distance movement of reproductive ants suarez et al 2001 excluding this possibility has a range of potential implications including the possibility that localised clusters of infestation typical of stratified diffusion processes shigesada et al 1995 appear near the boundary it is unclear how our simplifying assumption about the sources of new nests would influence the estimated benefit of citizen surveillance on the one hand citizen detections could potentially prevent geographic range expanding long distance movements but if such movements occur frequently enough they could render any control efforts ineffective reducing the contribution of citizen reports against this ambiguous effect of excluding long distance movements and the lack of data for estimating this effect is a known large computational cost of relaxing our assumption about the distance between parent nests and child nests for example in the counterfactual simulations there were many months in which there were more than 100 mature nests even if only a single new child nest was produced in the 8 months required for the nest to become reproductively mature there would be at least 1008 different graphs a combinatorial explosion simplifying approaches would need to be investigated including for example the selection of potential parent nests from a region or within a radius of 1 km or from among the five closest potential parent nests repeating this procedure would result in multiple different possible graphs an important question for further development of our approach is to explicitly consider the impacts of citizen reports on population range delimitation which is necessary in conservation harvesting and control applications the development of new population range delimitation methods is an active focus of research e g keith et al 2019 another important question for future research is to estimate the extent to which citizen surveillance contributions are attributable to past citizen support measures addressing this question requires an historical record of community support measures and a method for estimating the impact of these measures on citizen reporting however even without such information the method developed in this study can be used to assess whether a citizen support program should be re evaluated to justify its continued operation this would be true if citizen reporting impacts on the population of interest were estimated to be smaller than expected this is unlikely in the case study considered given that citizen reports were estimated to have substantially improved population management outcomes however it remains an open question whether the expenditures made on citizen support measures were justified by improved management outcomes another open question is whether changed citizen support measures would be beneficial the impact of citizen reports depends on where and when the reports are made which can potentially be influenced by the timing and spatial targeting of community engagement programs aimed at enhancing citizen surveillance an improved understanding of how and where citizen surveillance has the most impact and which citizen groups are most readily prepared to assist government agencies can underpin enhanced community engagement programs that produce larger benefits 5 conclusions given its low cost and broad geographic coverage citizen surveillance has the potential to make substantial contributions to the management of wild populations silvertown 2009 to make best use of citizen surveillance as an adjunct to organised surveillance its performance needs to be estimated counterfactual analysis can be used for this purpose and thereby provide a rigorous empirical basis for optimising the contribution of citizen surveillance to conservation harvesting and control programs reconstructions of populations histories represented as a graph offers a promising approach to estimate counterfactuals for citizen surveillance support programs and thereby help to adaptively improve the contribution of citizen surveillance credit authorship contribution statement daniel spring conceptualization methodology writing original draft and final manuscript

2017 lin et al 2020 wu et al 2022 however simulation studies of lucc are currently conducted mostly in urban areas with relatively few studies of rural areas zhou et al 2020 the reason is that the data availability in rural areas is relatively limited especially the multi year population and economic data are difficult to obtain in the public data platform pang et al 2022 notably the population and economic changes in rural areas can directly reflect the changes in land demand of rural residents gude et al 2006 ma et al 2018 zhao and wan 2021 cai et al 2022 zhang et al 2022 which has an essential impact on the accuracy of the simulation to predict future land cover changes in rural areas this research takes huangguashan village in chongqing china as the research object obtaining the

average rate of change in economy of each community in huangguashan village from 2007 to 2017 were obtained by calculation using a comparative experimental research method one experimental group used static one year population and economy data of each community in huangguashan village as the driving factor of the flus model for simulation while the other experimental group used dynamic multi year

comparing the simulated changes of various types of land use under the four scenarios the future development orientation choices of huangguashan village are proposed this research can provide a scientific evidence and significance for governments to make multi program rural development policies 2 research data and methods huangguashan village is one of the national agro ecological tourism demonstration sites in china located in the western part of chongqing fig 1 the rapid economic development of huangguashan village in recent years has triggered a fast and indiscriminate expansion of the construction land resulting in obvious conflicts between various types of land in village consequently the selection of huangguashan village as a research case in this research has a relatively typical and demonstrative effect 2 1 data source and processing the data used in this research consisted of four main parts table 1 i land use data the land use data of huangguashan village in 2012 2015 and 2017 at a spatial resolution of 30 m 30 m with reference to the chinese national level land use status classification standard china 2017 the land use types were divided into four major categories farmland forest water and construction land ii location factor data distance to road distance to water distance to attractions the location factors were calculated by the arcgis10 2 euclidean distance module iii natural environment factor data including the digital elevation model dem slope and aspect of huangguashan village in 2017 the dem with a resolution of 30 m is the basis for calculating slope and aspect iv socioeconomic factor data in this research the population and economic data of each community in huangguashan village from 2007 to 2017 were counted through fieldwork and on site statistics 2 2 research methods in this research the flus model was used to simulate the future land use changes in huangguashan village replacing the static population and economic data with the dynamic population change rate and economic change rate data comparing the accuracy kappa coefficients and oa of the two simulations based on the improved flus model to simulate the land use data of huangguashan village under four different policy development scenarios in the future fig 2 the specific research methods are as follows 2 2 1 flus model based simulation of future land use change the flus model which has been widely used to simulate land use changes at global and regional scales is used in this study to predict future land use changes under different scenarios the model includes the following 3 main aspects 1 probability measurement of land distribution suitability based on artificial neural network ann model ann model can effectively perform correlation analysis of nonlinear relationships and obtain the probability of site distribution suitability using existing results with the driver for training ann generally has three implicit layers namely output layer input layer and hidden layer dibike and solomatine 2001 zain et al 2010 its formula is as follows 1 s p p k t j w j k s i g m o i d n e t j p t j w j k 1 e n e t j p t 1 where s p p k t represents the suitability probability of land use type k at spatial location p at time t w j k is the self adaptive weight between the hidden layer and the output layer sigmoid n e t j p t is the incentive function from the hidden layer to the output layer n e t j p t means the signal fed by the neuron of the jth hidden layer in the region at training time t and image p for the fitness probability of the output of the model of the neural network the fitness probability of various land use types and is constant to 1 the formula is as follows 2 k s p p k t 1 1 adaptive inertia competition model setting includes condition settings such as neighborhood influence inertia coefficient conversion cost and competition between land use types one of the neighborhood influence includes the setting of neighborhood scope and neighborhood weight its formula is as follows 3 ω p k t n n c o n c p t 1 k n n 1 w k where ω p k t denotes the neighborhood influence of land use type k on image element p at the tth selection n n c o n c p t 1 k is the total number of image elements of land use type k in the neighborhood window of n n after t 1 selection w k is the neighborhood weight of different land use types the neighborhood weight is the expansion capacity of different types of land under the joint action of driving forces with values ranging from 0 to 1 higher values are associated with the stronger expansion capacity of that land use type the inertia coefficient is determined based on the difference between the amount of macro demand and the actual number of allocated land use types with adaptive adjustment in the iterative process so that the amount of each land use type evolves toward the macro demand target zhang et al 2019 tian et al 2020 wang et al 2021 wang et al 2021 it is defined as 4 i n e r t i a l k t i n e r t i a l k t 1 d k t 1 d k t 1 i n e r t i a l k t 1 d k t 2 d k t 1 0 d k t 2 d k t 1 i n e r t i a l k t 1 d k t 1 d k t 2 d k t 1 d k t 2 0 the inertial is the coefficient of inertia for land use type k at iteration number t d denotes the difference between the land use demand and the allocated area at t 1 as the inertia coefficient is only for the land use type on the occupied image element if the potential land use type k is not the same as the current land use type c the land use inertia coefficient k will be defined as 1 and will not affect the total probability of land use for land use type k with the above steps the formula for calculating the total probability of land use on each image element is as follows hu et al 2020 li et al 2020 wang et al 2021 5 t p p k t p p k ω p k t i n e r t i a l k t 1 s c c k where t p p k t is the probability of the combination of the transformation of the image element p from the original land use to the target k at iteration time t p p k denotes the probability of occurrence of p in land use type k using neural network arithmetic ω p k t denotes the neighborhood action of land use type k on image element p at time t and s c c k is the probability of transformation from original land use type c to target k 1 denotes a possible transformation 0 denotes an impossible transformation batisani and yarnal 2009 tolpekin and stein 2009 liu et al 2017 1 validation of model accuracy the flus model adopts a roulette selection model with random characteristics for land use type conversion based on the calculation of total probability thereby reflecting the uncertainty of real world land use changes and alternating land use changes which better reflects the competition among land types to verify the flus model s validity historical data are used here for simulation the accuracy kappa coefficient and oa are used to validate its accuracy in which kappa coefficient and oa are between 0 and 1 the closer the value is to 1 the higher the model accuracy is when kappa coefficient 0 75 the model simulation accuracy is high while when the kappa coefficient is between 0 5 and 0 75 the model simulation accuracy is average liu et al 2017 lin et al 2020 2 2 2 using the rate of demographic and economic change as a driving force to improve the model the research uses dynamic multi year average rate of change in population and average rate of change in economy data instead of static one year population and economy data to compare the accuracy kappa coefficients and oa of the two sets the specific model setup is as follows 1 model setup for static one year data the simulation of the land use a total of 8 driving factors of population gdp dem slope aspect distance to water distance to roads and distance to attractions for 2017 fig 3 1 model setup for dynamic multi year data the average rate of change of population and the average rate of change of gdp from 2012 to 2017 were used to replace the population and gdp in 2017 as the driving factors fig 4 while other driving factors were the same as the first group which were dem slope aspect distance to water distance to roads and distance to attractions for a total of eight driving factors for the simulation of land use 2 2 3 multiple scenario setting for future development according to the ecological protection plan socioeconomic development plan arable land protection plan and village planning published in recent years the flus model was used to set up four different future development scenarios of huangguashan village in 2030 including ecological conservation priority economic development priority farmland conservation priority and integrated development priority the specific scenario settings are described as follows 1 ecological conservation priority scenario under the ecological protection priority scenario the foremost task is to protect ecological land from invasion and the reduction of the corresponding land types while encouraging the conversion of other land types to ecological land this is specifically demonstrated in the model implementation process by i increase the transfer probability of other land types to forest land and grassland appropriately as well as reduce the transfer probability of forest land and grassland to other land types appropriately increase the demand of forest land and grassland in the forecast year ii increase the cost of converting forest land and grassland to other land uses taking into account the policy implications of ecological conservation in order to realize the principle of ecological conservation priority 1 economic priority scenario under the priority economic development scenario construction land is the most prioritized component of economic development which is manifested in the model implementation process by i increasing the probability of transferring other land types to construction land and reducing the probability of transferring construction land to other land to increase the demand for construction land in the forecast year ii considering the policy implications of prioritizing the development of construction land adding the cost of converting construction land to other land to achieve the priority economic development principle 1 farmland conservation priority scenario under the farmland conservation priority scenario farmland is the utmost vital land use type so effective conservation of farmland resources is the primary objective in this scenario in the process of model implementation it is manifested as i suitably increasing the transfer probability of other land use types to farmland and reducing the transfer probability of farmland to other land use types to enhance the demand for farmland in the forecast year ii taking into account the current gradual increase in china s demand for farmland in recent years which requires vigorous efforts to increase the national grain seeding area and yield so that the cost of converting farmland to other land use types is increased to realize the farmland conservation priority principle 1 integrated development priority scenario under the priority scenario of integrated development requires a combination of the multiple needs of the three scenarios ecological protection priority economic development priority and farmland protection priority the scenario is set up to balance the harmony of human and ecological environment as well as the sustainable socioeconomic development in the process of model implementation the concrete performance is to continue the 2000 2017 development pattern mainly and to balance the transfer probability between various types of land in order to realize the principle of integrated development priority 3 simulation results and analysis 3 1 land use change characteristics the area changes of various types of land in huangguashan village during 2012 2017 were counted using gis10 2 table 2 during 2012 2017 the area of farmland in huangguashan village gradually decreased the area of forest land steadily increased the area of water basically remained the same the area of construction land first decreased and then increased in 2012 the farmland was 11 96 km2 forest was 5 65 km2 water was 0 37 km2 and construction land was 2 36 km2 in 2015 the farmland was 11 83 km2 forest was 5 81 km2 water was 0 37 km2 and construction land was 2 32 km2 in 2017 the farmland was 11 39 km2 forest was 6 18 km2 water was 0 38 km2 and construction land was 2 39 km2 the change rate of farmland in 2015 was 1 0 forest change rate was 2 9 and construction land change rate was 1 6 the change rate of farmland in 2017 was 3 6 forest change rate was 6 3 and construction land change rate was 3 0 3 2 improved model accuracy validation this research simulates the 2015 and 2017 land use patterns based on 2012 land use data comparing the simulation accuracy data of the two groups table 3 and fig 5 the kappa coefficient and oa of the model with dynamic multi year data in 2015 are 0 9258 and 0 9580 respectively which is higher than the kappa coefficient and oa of the model with static one year data in 2015 precision improved by 3 24 and 1 78 the kappa coefficient and oa of the model with dynamic multi year data in 2017 were 0 8867 and 0 9360 respectively which were 6 34 and 3 63 higher than those of the model with static one year data in 2017 it indicates that the model with dynamic multi year data has better simulation accuracy the simulation results have more similarity with the actual land use in terms of spatial distribution especially for the more long term simulation to improve the effect more obviously 3 3 multi scenario simulation of future land use change land use data of huangguashan village in 2030 was simulated by using the improved flus model with 2017 land use data as the base four different scenarios of ecological conservation priority economic development priority farmland conservation priority and integrated development priority were set to simulate the land use change in huangguashan village in 2030 the simulation results of land use change for the four different scenarios are as follows fig 5 table 4 3 3 1 ecological conservation priority scenario the simulation results show that the area of farmland is 11 2 km2 accounting for 54 82 the area of forest is 7 06 km2 accounting for 34 56 the area of water area is 0 38 km2 accounting for 1 86 and the area of construction land is 1 79 km2 accounting for 8 76 this scenario has the largest proportion of forest and water area compared to the other three scenarios 3 3 2 economic development priority scenario the simulation results show that in 2030 the area of farmland is 10 1 km2 accounting for 49 68 the area of forest is 5 46 km2 accounting for 26 86 the area of water is 0 37 km2 accounting for 1 82 and the area of construction land is 4 40 km2 accounting for 21 64 this scenario has the largest proportion of construction land area compared to the other three scenarios 3 3 3 farmland conservation priority scenario the simulation results show that in 2030 the area of farmland is 13 1 km2 accounting for 64 41 the forest area is 5 16 km2 accounting for 25 37 the water area is 0 37 km2 accounting for 1 82 and the construction land is 1 71 km2 accounting for 8 41 this scenario has the largest proportion of farmland area compared to the other three scenarios 3 3 4 integrated development priority scenario the simulation results show that in 2030 the area of farmland is 12 1 km2 accounting for 59 23 the forest area is 5 46 km2 accounting for 26 73 the water area is 0 38 km2 accounting for 1 86 and the construction land is 2 49 km2 accounting for 12 19 this scenario has the most balanced proportion of each land type compared to the other three scenarios figs 6 7 4 conclusion and discussion 4 1 conclusion from the simulation results as well as the accuracy verification the accuracy kappa coefficients were improved by 3 24 and 6 34 by using the average rate of change of population and the average rate of change of economy from 2012 to 2017 to simulate the land use in 2015 and 2017 respectively with an oa improvement of 1 78 and 3 63 the results show that adopting dynamic multi year average rate of population change and average rate of economic change data to replace static one year population and economic data for future land use simulation can simulate future land use in rural areas with higher accuracy with the flus model which results are closer to the actual situation particularly for the long term simulation to improve the effect more obviously according to the ecological protection plan socioeconomic development plan farmland conservation plan and urban planning published in recent years the four different future development scenarios of priority ecological conservation priority economic development priority farmland conservation and priority integrated development set up in huangguashan village can basically cater to the needs of different development orientations of huangguashan village in the future compared with the other three scenarios the integrated development priority scenario has a more balanced proportion of the land use which takes into account the three objectives of farmland conservation ecological conservation and economic development therefore the research recommends that the integrated development priority scenario should be adopted as the direction for future policy formulation and planning development in huangguashan village 4 2 discussion the findings of this research are applicable to the simulation study of future land use in rural areas in china and other countries which can study the land use changes in rural areas more scientifically and methodically providing more effective scientific decision support for the governments of various countries in the making and implementation of different policies for rural development in the future combined with the simulation results the growth boundary can be further delineated in the next study based on the simulation of land use changes in different scenarios to avoid the uncontrolled expansion of construction land to achieve the sustainable development of rural areas in this research although the effects of various factors are considered comprehensively four categories of data including land use data location factor data natural environment factor data and socioeconomic factor data are adopted to improve the accuracy of the model as much as possible however due to the complexity of the research object there are still some elements e g climatic factors

defined as 1 and will not affect the total probability of land use for land use type k with the above steps the formula for calculating the total probability of land use on each image element is as follows hu et al 2020 li et al 2020 wang et al 2021 5 t p p k t p p k ω p k t i n e r t i a l k t 1 s c c k where t p p k t is the probability of the combination of the transformation of the image

characteristics for land use type conversion based on the calculation of total probability thereby reflecting the uncertainty of real world land use changes and alternating land use changes which better reflects the competition among land types to verify the flus model s validity historical data are used here for simulation the accuracy kappa coefficient and oa are used to validate its accuracy in which kappa coefficient and oa are between 0 and 1 the closer the value is to 1 the higher the model accuracy is when kappa coefficient 0 75 the model simulation accuracy is high while when the kappa coefficient is between 0 5 and 0 75 the model simulation accuracy is average liu et al 2017 lin et al 2020 2 2 2 using the rate of demographic and economic change as a driving force to improve the model the research uses dynamic multi year average rate of change in population and average rate of change in economy data instead of static one year population and economy data to compare the accuracy kappa coefficients and oa of the two sets the specific model setup is as follows 1 model setup for static one year data the simulation of the land use a total of 8 driving factors of population gdp dem slope aspect distance to water distance to roads and distance to attractions for 2017 fig 3 1 model setup for dynamic multi year data the average rate of change of population and the average rate of change of gdp from 2012 to 2017 were used to replace the population and gdp in 2017 as the driving factors fig 4 while other driving factors were the same as the first group which were dem slope aspect distance to water distance to roads and distance to attractions for a total of eight driving factors for the simulation of land use 2 2 3 multiple scenario setting for future development according to the ecological protection plan socioeconomic development plan arable land protection plan and village planning published in recent years the flus model was used to set up four different future development scenarios of huangguashan village in 2030 including ecological conservation priority economic development priority farmland conservation priority and integrated development priority the specific scenario settings are described as follows 1 ecological conservation priority scenario under the ecological protection priority scenario the foremost task is to protect ecological land from invasion and the reduction of the corresponding land types while encouraging the conversion of other land types to ecological land this is specifically demonstrated in the model implementation process by i increase the transfer probability of other land types to forest land and grassland appropriately as well as reduce the transfer probability of forest land and grassland to other land types appropriately increase the demand of forest land and grassland in the forecast year ii increase the cost of converting forest land and grassland to other land uses taking into account the policy implications of ecological conservation in order to realize the principle of ecological conservation priority 1 economic priority scenario under the priority economic development scenario construction land is the most prioritized component of economic development which is manifested in the model implementation process by i increasing the probability of transferring other land types to construction land and reducing the probability of transferring construction land to other land to increase the demand for construction land in the forecast year ii considering the policy implications of prioritizing the development of construction land adding the cost of converting construction land to other land to achieve the priority economic development principle 1 farmland conservation priority scenario under the farmland conservation priority scenario farmland is the utmost vital land use type so effective conservation of farmland resources is the primary objective in this scenario in the process of model implementation it is manifested as i suitably increasing the transfer probability of other land use types to farmland and reducing the transfer probability of farmland to other land use types to enhance the demand for farmland in the forecast year ii taking into account the current gradual increase in china s demand for farmland in recent years which requires vigorous efforts to increase the national grain seeding area and yield so that the cost of converting farmland to other land use types is increased to realize the farmland conservation priority principle 1 integrated development priority scenario under the priority scenario of integrated development requires a combination of the multiple needs of the three scenarios ecological protection priority economic development priority and farmland protection priority the scenario is set up to balance the harmony of human and ecological environment as well as the sustainable socioeconomic development in the process of model implementation the concrete performance is to continue the 2000 2017 development pattern mainly and to balance the transfer probability between various types of land in order to realize the principle of integrated development priority 3 simulation results and analysis 3 1 land use change characteristics the area changes of various types of land in huangguashan village during 2012 2017 were counted using gis10 2 table 2 during 2012 2017 the area of farmland in huangguashan village gradually decreased the area of forest land steadily increased the area of water basically remained the same the area of construction land first decreased and then increased in 2012 the farmland was 11 96 km2 forest was 5 65 km2 water was 0 37 km2 and construction land was 2 36 km2 in 2015 the farmland was 11 83 km2 forest was 5 81 km2 water was 0 37 km2 and construction land was 2 32 km2 in 2017 the farmland was 11 39 km2 forest was 6 18 km2 water was 0 38 km2 and construction land was 2 39 km2 the change rate of farmland in 2015 was 1 0 forest change rate was 2 9 and construction land change rate was 1 6 the change rate of farmland in 2017 was 3 6 forest change rate was 6 3 and construction land change rate was 3 0 3 2 improved model accuracy validation this research simulates the 2015 and 2017 land use patterns based on 2012 land use data comparing the simulation accuracy data of the two groups table 3 and fig 5 the kappa coefficient and oa of the model with dynamic multi year data in 2015 are 0 9258 and 0 9580 respectively which is higher than the kappa coefficient and oa of the model with static one year data in 2015 precision improved by 3 24 and 1 78 the kappa coefficient and oa of the model with dynamic multi year data in 2017 were 0 8867 and 0 9360 respectively which were 6 34 and 3 63 higher than those of the model with static one year data in 2017 it indicates that the model with dynamic multi year data has better simulation accuracy the simulation results have more similarity with the actual land use in terms of spatial distribution especially for the more long term simulation to improve the effect more obviously 3 3 multi scenario simulation of future land use change land use data of huangguashan village in 2030 was simulated by using the improved flus model with 2017 land use data as the base four different scenarios of ecological conservation priority economic development priority farmland conservation priority and integrated development priority were set to simulate the land use change in huangguashan village in 2030 the simulation results of land use change for the four different scenarios are as follows fig 5 table 4 3 3 1 ecological conservation priority scenario the simulation results show that the area of farmland is 11 2 km2 accounting for 54 82 the area of forest is 7 06 km2 accounting for 34 56 the area of water area is 0 38 km2 accounting for 1 86 and the area of construction land is 1 79 km2 accounting for 8 76 this scenario has the largest proportion of forest and water area compared to the other three scenarios 3 3 2 economic development priority scenario the simulation results show that in 2030 the area of farmland is 10 1 km2 accounting for 49 68 the area of forest is 5 46 km2 accounting for 26 86 the area of water is 0 37 km2 accounting for 1 82 and the area of construction land is 4 40 km2 accounting for 21 64 this scenario has the largest proportion of construction land area compared to the other three scenarios 3 3 3 farmland conservation priority scenario the simulation results show that in 2030 the area of farmland is 13 1 km2 accounting for 64 41 the forest area is 5 16 km2 accounting for 25 37 the water area is 0 37 km2 accounting for 1 82 and the construction land is 1 71 km2 accounting for 8 41 this scenario has the largest proportion of farmland area compared to the other three scenarios 3 3 4 integrated development priority scenario the simulation results show that in 2030 the area of farmland is 12 1 km2 accounting for 59 23 the forest area is 5 46 km2 accounting for 26 73 the water area is 0 38 km2 accounting for 1 86 and the construction land is 2 49 km2 accounting for 12 19 this scenario has the most balanced proportion of each land type compared to the other three scenarios figs 6 7 4 conclusion and discussion 4 1 conclusion from the simulation results as well as the accuracy verification the accuracy kappa coefficients were improved by 3 24 and 6 34 by using the average rate of change of population and the average rate of change of economy from 2012 to 2017 to simulate the land use in 2015 and 2017 respectively with an oa improvement of 1 78 and 3 63 the results show that adopting dynamic multi year average rate of population change and average rate of economic change data to replace static one year population and economic data for future land use simulation can simulate future land use in rural areas with higher accuracy with the flus model which results are closer to the actual situation particularly for the long term simulation to improve the effect more obviously according to the ecological protection plan socioeconomic development plan farmland conservation plan and urban planning published in recent years the four different future development scenarios of priority ecological conservation priority economic development priority farmland conservation and priority integrated development set up in huangguashan village can basically cater to the needs of different development orientations of huangguashan village in the future compared with the other three scenarios the integrated development priority scenario has a more balanced proportion of the land use which takes into account the three objectives of farmland conservation ecological conservation and economic development therefore the research recommends that the integrated development priority scenario should be adopted as the direction for future policy formulation and planning development in huangguashan village 4 2 discussion the findings of this research are applicable to the simulation study of future land use in rural areas in china and other countries which can study the land use changes in rural areas more scientifically and methodically providing more effective scientific decision support for the governments of various countries in the making and implementation of different policies for rural development in the future combined with the simulation results the growth boundary can be further delineated in the next study based on the simulation of land use changes in different scenarios to avoid the uncontrolled expansion of construction land to achieve the sustainable development of rural areas in this research although the effects of various factors are considered comprehensively four categories of data including land use data location factor data natural environment factor data and socioeconomic factor data are adopted to improve the accuracy of the model as much as possible however due to the complexity of the research object there are still some elements e g climatic factors

24314,information on crop yield is important for food security in particular under the conditions of climate change and growing population worldwide we developed a new fully distributed high spatial resolution model of biomass accumulation and crop yield applicable to a highly heterogeneous desert oasis agroecosystem the bulk of required input data is obtained by retrieving pixel wise biogeophysical variables from a suite of very diverse satellite data both temperature and water stress conditions at field scale are given full consideration while the model was designed to strike a balance between model applicability and satisfactory characterization of the heterogeneous desert oasis system to estimate field scale yield the development of this model relies on three main innovations first the start and end of the growing season were estimated for each pixel by calibrating the high spatial and temporal resolution observations of normalized difference vegetation index ndvi by sentinal 2 s2 msi multi spectral instrument against limited local phenological information second to monitor crop water stress account taken of irrigation a process based water and energy balance model was applied to estimate the actual evapotranspiration et this requires knowledge of soil water availability which is characterized by downscaling the ascat advanced scatterrometer soil moisture data product to capture the dominant features of the eco hydrological conditions in the desert and oasis agroecosystem et was further downscaled from the 1 km resolution third likewise the water stress indicator the air temperature stress indicator was mapped after characterizing the thermal contrast and heterogeneity of the desert oasis system by generating time series of air temperature at 1 km spatial resolution using the modis moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer land surface temperature lst data product in the temporal dimension gaps were mitigated by applying time series analysis techniques to reconstruct cloud free time series of lst ndvi fapar and albedo these innovations add up to a high resolution characterization of crop response to the geospatial variability of weather and climate forcing in the desert oasis agroecosystem the model was applied to the dominant crops i e spring wheat maize sunflower and melon in the oases of the shiyang river basin northwestern china characterized by a rather fragmented land use the high resolution of pixel wise ecohydrological parameters i e crop phenology temperature stress and water stress factors successfully reflect differences of crops with different phenology and location in the oases the relative errors for wheat and maize yields compared to the census data are less than 5 at district level at the county level the relative errors of wheat yields of liangzhou minqin gulang jinchuan and yongchang equal to 0 87 24 2 9 7 12 5 and 7 2 for maize the dominant crop the error on estimated yields was less than 5 except in gulang the relative error on estimated yield for sunflower was less than 10 compared to agricultural census data the relative error on estimated melon yield was 16 this performance highlights the applicability of the model to estimate field scale yields in agroecosystems characterized by fragmented land use keywords crop yield estimation multi source remote sensing data high resolution heterogeneous agroecosystem data availability the remote sensing and reanalysis data products are publicly available the authors do not have permission to share the meteorological in site data 1 introduction the growing world population applies tremendous pressure on agriculture production and natural environmental resources especially in developing regions the global population is expected to reach 9 8 billions by 2050 undesa 2017 to meet the demands of population growth and the projected changes in dietary patterns in the future global food production must increase by 70 100 wart et al 2013 therefore given such a dramatic requirement both expansion of cultivated land and increased agricultural intensity will be needed with further impact on the natural environment the changing climate intensifies the risks of droughts and floods which pose a significant threat to food production information on crop yield under limiting environmental conditions such as due to water availability and quality is therefore important for food security and environmental studies under the conditions of climate change and fast growing population modeling is a vital tool to obtain crop yield information at regional and global scales especially because it allows to assess the expected performance of agroecosystems under changing climate and crop management conditions

significant in addition when applied to regions with fragmented land uses and complex cropping patterns a high spatial resolution model configuration is needed which requires large computing resources various satellite remote sensing observations can provide information reflecting the spatial and temporal features in the crop pattern and conditions e g crop type crop phenology and health condition an alternative way is using a remote sensing data driven model yet with a robust bio physical basis in these models biomass accumulation is estimated by applying the light use efficiency lue concept according to monteith 1972 through the crop growing season while parameterizations are applied to estimate crop yield from biomass lue is defined as the biomass produced by photosynthesis per unit of absorbed radiant energy the lue based method combines the solar photosynthetically active radiation par the intercepted fraction of par fapar the fraction of absorbed photosynthetically active radiation by vegetation and the par utilization efficiency to determine the daily biomass accumulation in theory the lue based method is consistent with detailed biophysical models of photosynthesis under the reasonable hypothesis that multiple biochemical processes combine to determine optimal photosynthesis haxeltine and prentice 1996 in practice the actual par utilization efficiency in the lue based models is expressed as the product of an optimal lue with a number of stress factors the main difference in the lue based models is the definition and estimation of the parameters being used to down regulate the optimal biomass accumulation rate to the actual rate since the bio geochemical controls on lue are still poorly understood for example the casa carnegie ames stanford approach potter et al 1993 takes into account the variation of lue with seasons and biomes field et al 1995 further improved the lue based modeling by considering limitations due to temperature and water deficit the glo pem2 global production efficiency model and modis psn modis moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer daily photosynthesis adopted vapor pressure deficit vpd to express the water stress goetz et al 2000 zhao et al 2005 lue based models have been implemented as a core element of systems for large area monitoring of biomass and crop yield estimations taking advantage of remote sensing data gower et al 1999 veroustraete et al 2002 bastiaanssen and ali 2003 zwart et al 2010 teixeira et al 2013 such systems are also being operated in an operational context such as in the marsop monitoring agriculture through remote sensing techniques system http www marsop info and in the global land component of the gmes global monitoring for environment and security initial operations gio gl van hools and eerens 2015 notwithstanding these successful experiences challenges still exist and were addressed in this study in a highly heterogenous desert oasis agroecosystem with fragmented land uses and complex crop patterns crop conditions must be characterized as a spatial resolution adequate to capture both the heterogeneity within the oases and the contrast with the surrounding desert area hydrological conditions must be monitored at a spatial resolution consistent with such variability to understand the crop response to weather and climate forcing specifically this applies to crop phenology and related biophysical variables to soil water availability and to thermal conditions on the other hand in practice the retrieval of information on hydrological conditions and surface temperature obtained from infrared and microwave observations is frequently hampered by low spatial resolution besides optical and thermal remote sensing observations are often contaminated by weather conditions with considerable impacts on the estimation of fapar ndvi albedo and land surface temperature lst time series reconstruction is therefore needed to obtain gap free essential variables to estimate crop biomass accumulation at high temporal resolution the innovations we deployed to address these challenges add up to a high resolution model characterizing the crop response to the geospatial variability of weather and climate forcing in the desert oasis agroecosystem the development of this model relies on three main innovations first the start and end of the growing season were estimated for each pixel by calibrating the high spatial and temporal resolution observations of ndvi by sentinal 2 s2 msi multi spectral instrument against limited local phenological information the high temporal frequency of s2 msi makes it possible to retrieve directly the temporal evolution of relevant biophysical variables related to crop phenology without using an approximate method such as the application of temperature sums second to monitor crop water stress account taken of irrigation we use a process based water and energy balance model etmonitor hu and jia 2015 cui and jia 2021 zheng et al 2022 to estimate the actual evapotranspiration et which requires knowledge of soil water availability monitored by using satellite observations of soil moisture to mitigate the gap in spatial resolution with the field scale information on crop conditions soil moisture was estimated using the ascat advanced scatterrometer soil moisture data downscaled to modis lst resolution the relationship between the downscaled soil moisture and the predictors i e lst ndvi albedo dem digital elevation model and location was constructed using a machine learning model to capture the dominant features of the eco hydrological conditions in the desert and oasis agroecosystem the et was further downscaled from the 1 km resolution third likewise the water stress indicator the air temperature stress indicator was mapped after characterizing the thermal contrast and heterogeneity of the desert oasis system by generating time series of air temperature at 1 km spatial resolution using the modis lst data product in the temporal dimension gaps were mitigated by applying time series analysis techniques to reconstruct cloud free time series of lst ndvi and albedo 2 study area and data 2 1 study area the shiyang river basin srb is one of the three inner drainage river basins in hexi corridor northwestern china located between 101 41 e and 104 16 e 36 26 n and 39 27 n fig 1 it originates from the cold and semi arid qilian mountains in the south and ends in the temperate and arid desert oasis region in the north occupying an area of 41 600 km2 the srb covers the main areas of liangzhou minqin jinchang yongchang and gulang counties the river water supply primarily comes from rainfall and glacier and snow melting in the qilian mountain area the oases in the srb play a vital role in the water and food security of northwestern china the growing season is april to october the annual precipitation in the agricultural area varies from 100 to 300 mm while the potential et is 1200 to 2000 mm wang et al 2012 thus local agriculture heavily relies on irrigation to keep the pace with the local economic development the water and land resources have been over exploited mainly for agriculture which induced a severe ecosystem crisis water conflicts arose between ecosystem preservation and agriculture and between different sub regions li et al 2007 xue et al 2015 the agricultural area of the srb is characterized by fragmented land use and complex cropping pattern xue et al 2015 the dominant food crops are spring wheat and maize and local high value crops are sunflower and melon crop yield and et estimates can provide meaningful spatial and temporal information for a comprehensive understanding of the water productivity of the region and support effective decision making 2 2 remote sensing data the remote sensing data applied in this study table 1 include the s2 msi surface reflectance sr data products modis land surface products of lst ndvi and albedo ascat surface soil moisture saturation products srtm shuttle radar topography mission dem and a predefined crop classification map the s2 mission was launched in 2015 by esa european space agency to service wide swath high spatial and temporal resolution and multi spectral land monitoring the msi can provide observations with 10 m spatial resolution in four spectral bands i e the three classical rgb bands and a near infra red nir band the s2 system is designed for global crop growth monitoring with a 5 day revisiting interval in this study we specifically adopted the s2 msi level 2 bottom of atmosphere boa reflectance data product https scihub copernicus eu in band 4 red band with central wavelength 665 nm and band 8 near infrared band with central wavelength 833 nm to estimate ndvi and fapar during the growing season of 2019 in the study area the modis land surface products http lpdaac usgs gov including mod11a1 land surface temperature mod13a2 ndvi and mcd43a3 albedo in 2019 were selected for air temperature and et estimation the mcd43a3 data were resampled to 1 km by linear interpolation to match the other modis data products before further processing the daily ascat dataset https land copernicus eu global products swi of surface soil moisture saturation at 0 1 was also used as input to the et estimation model i e etmonitor when applying the etmonitor model the 0 1 ascat dataset was first downscaled and projected to the same spatial resolution of 1 km modis data see sect 3 5 a 10 m crop classification map for 2019 fig 1 was generated by applying a machine learning method to the multi spectral and multi temporal s2 msi surface reflectance data the validation based on ground observations shows that the overall classification accuracy is 90 yi et al 2020 2 3 reanalysis meteorological data the gridded daily meteorological data required to estimate et and absorbed photosynthetically active radiation apar conditions i e surface pressure wind speed relative humidity precipitation downward shortwave radiation and downward longwave radiation were extracted from the era5 reanalysis dataset http apps ecmwf int datasets of ecmwf european centre for medium range weather forecasts the era5 dataset has an original spatial resolution of 0 25 and was downscaled to 1 km using srtm dem stahl et al 2006 gao and giorgi 2008 hu and jia 2015 2 4 ground measurements to estimate the temperature stress factors regulating the biomass accumulation we used the daily mean air temperature measured at three meteorological ground stations table 2 in the oasis the data collected in the period from march to november 2019 covering the main growing season of shiyang river basin were applied to parameterize the relationship between lst and the mean daily air temperature the locations of ground sites are shown in fig 1c 2 5 agricultural census data the agricultural census data on crop yield is officially reported in the gansu development yearbook 2020 gansu development yearbook editorial committee 2021 3 methods model overview in the proposed model to estimate crop biomass accumulation both temperature and water limitations were given full consideration to adjust the optimal crop growth rate to the actual rate the timely and spatially detailed biophysical information needed to model biomass accumulation and yield formation i e crop type phenological development apar air temperature stress and water stress was retrieved by addressing the challenges identified in the introduction to this end a remote sensing data driven framework to ingest s2 msi at surface spectral reflectance modis land surface products ascat surface soil moisture saturation data srtm dem and era5 reanalysis meteorological data was developed remote sensing multi spectral information was combined to capture the pixel wise real crop growth status related to crop specific properties environmental constraints and the field management the model was designed to strike a balance between model applicability and satisfactory characterization of the heterogeneous desert oasis system to estimate field scale yield the proposed model see fig 2 to estimate biomass accumulation and crop yield at high spatial resolution includes the following elements 1 time series reconstruction of remote sensing data 2 crop phenology estimation 3 apar estimation 4 estimation of air temperature stress factor 5 downscaling of soil moisture 6 estimation of et and rn and water stress 7 1 estimation of biomass by lue model and 7 2 crop yield the following paragraphs describe in detail the seven elements of the model 3 1 time series reconstruction of remote sensing observations in the proposed method the pixel wise crop emergence and harvest dates and the fapar were estimated using the time series of s2 msi ndvi taking advantage of the high spatial and temporal resolution the daily water stress condition was estimated from the daily et which requires time series of modis ndvi and albedo the daily air temperature stress was estimated from 1 km lst using the method by alfieri et al 2013 in which time series of modis lst is required the ndvi albedo and lst derived from satellite observations are often contaminated by clouds which hampers their application to observe terrestrial vegetation properties to obtain a spatially and temporally continuous ndvi albedo and lst dataset the method of harmonic analysis of time series hants was applied to the s2 msi ndvi and modis ndvi albedo and lst products to remove the cloud influence menenti et al 1993 verhoef 1996 roerink et al 2000 hadipour 2021 zhou et al 2021 the hants method decomposes a time series into several frequency components based on the concept of a discrete fourier transform considering that albedo and ndvi change gradually driven by vegetation phenology we applied four frequencies with periods equal to 360 days 180 days 120 days and 90 days respectively in hants to capture the seasonal variation of ndvi and albedo in the study area besides the four frequencies reflecting seasonal variability to reconstruct the lst time series we added two more frequencies with periods equal to 30 days and 15 days to capture the short term variability due to possible fluctuations of atmospheric weather conditions cloud contaminated observations are identified by hants as outliers and assigned a lower weight prior to a new iteration in the reconstruction of the time series the analyst needs to specify whether outliers are positive or negative anomalies relative to the current reconstruction of the time series cloud contaminated observations give negative values of ndvi and lst so outliers in ndvi and lst time series are defined as negative anomalies given the high albedo of clouds outliers in albedo are defined as positive anomalies and lower weights are given to the higher outliers which is contrary to the situation of ndvi and lst zhou et al 2016 evaluated the accuracy of hants in the reconstruction of noisy and cloud contaminated observations in comparison with four other methods and documented the generally good performance of hants 3 2 crop phenology estimation the crop emergence and harvest dates identify the period of time available for biomass accumulation during the growing season and then obtain the final yield in the proposed model the pixel wise crop emergence and harvest dates were estimated by applying crop specific thresholds to the gap free time series of s2 msi ndvi this was made possible by the high spatial and temporal resolution first local knowledge indicated typical emergence and harvest dates applicable to the entire area table 3 second the ndvi values at these typical emergence and harvest dates were extracted for each crop from the spatially averaged ndvi temporal profiles ndvi t fig 3 third these ndvi values were applied as thresholds to the pixel wise annual ndvi temporal profile to estimate the emergence and harvest dates for each crop and for each pixel this method considers the specific characteristics of different crops and makes effective use of limited local phenological knowledge to determine the ndvi thresholds at the emergence and harvest dates in the growing season valid for the entire study area this solution was feasible because of the relative uniformity of local climate and of farming practices i e leading to limited variability in the emergence and harvest dates 3 3 apar estimation the photosynthetically active radiation absorbed by the vegetation apar mj m2 day defined as 1 a p a r f a p a r p a r where par mj m2 day is the solar irradiance in the spectral range between 0 4μm and 0 7 μ m where the absorption bands of photosynthetic pigments are located we followed the generally accepted approximation that on average daily par is 48 of the daily at surface downward shortwave irradiance between 0 4μm and 2 5 μ m mccree 1972 the solar energy absorption by leaf pigments in the red band and high reflectance in the nir band make the ndvi an appropriate indicator to estimate fapar a wealth of studies explored the relationship between fapar and ndvi daughtry et al 1992 myneni and williams 1994 chen 1996 gitelson et al 2014 we use the linear equation proposed in bastiaanssen and ali 2003 as applicable to multiple crops 2 f a p a r 1 257 ndvi 0 161 with f a p a r 0 i f f a p a r 0 3 4 estimation of temperature stress factor air temperature t a is an important parameter influencing the activity of key enzymes in photosynthesis which is reflected by the temperature stress factor f t the temperature stress factor includes two terms f t 1 and f t 2 here 3 f t f t 1 f t 2 4 f t 1 0 8 0 02 t o p t 0 0005 t o p t 2 5 f t 2 1 1814 1 exp 0 2 t o p t 10 t m o n 1 1 exp 0 3 t o p t 10 t m o n where t o p t c denotes the temperature when photosynthetic efficiency reaches the maximum value and t mon c is the monthly mean air temperature f t 1 reduces crop growth rate in very cold and hot habitats and f t 2 reflects a seasonal depression of crop growth rate when temperature departs from the optimal temperature field et al 1995 proposed to estimate t o p t as the mean air temperature in the month when ndvi reaches the maximum value in a desert and oasis landscape thermal heterogeneity of the land surface and the local variation of air temperature is not negligible for regional scale applications the gridded t a is usually obtained by interpolating data collected at meteorological ground stations or provided by reanalysis datasets with grid resolution at 0 1 0 5 application of such data will smooth out the main thermal heterogeneity given the sparseness of the stations and the coarse grid of reanalysis datasets especially for small fragmented regions like the srb in this study the mean daily air temperature at 1 km resolution was applied to estimate biomass and yield at 10 m spatial resolution assuming meteorological conditions over 1 km extent did not change dramatically the 1 km daily mean air temperature t a was estimated based on daily observations of lst mod11a1 1 km using the approach proposed by alfieri et al 2013 a linear relationship eq 6 between lst and the daily mean t a measured at ground stations is established and further applied to obtain the gridded daily mean air temperature at the same resolution of the remotely sensed lst i e 1 km much higher than that of reanalysis datasets 6 t a l s t m n where m and n are coefficients for areas within the same climate zone m and n can be applied for an entire region in this study the gap free lst time series generated from the modis lst product and t a observations from three meteorology stations in the oasis area for the whole year in 2019 were used to establish the relationship described in eq 6 thus gap free daily t a at 1 km resolution were obtained for the entire srb and aggregated to estimate the monthly temperature stress factors f t 1 and f t 2 the 10 m f t 1 and f t 2 were obtained through linear interpolation to match the grid size of the other input data 3 5 downscaling of soil moisture as regards the estimates of et and the water stress indicator one of the significant uncertainties is the low spatial resolution and discontinuous soil moisture data at present ascat soil moisture dataset is a long term dataset with a relatively high spatial resolution 0 1 degree and is publicly available thus in this study a spatially continuous soil moisture dataset at high spatial resolution 1 km was generated by downscaling the ascat soil moisture data utilizing multi source remote sensing data and the random forest rf machine learning model breiman 2001 the covariance matrix to apply rf machine learning model includes lst ndvi albedo dem longitude and latitude the spatial patterns of the soil moisture in this arid semi arid region are mainly driven by precipitation and agricultural activities which are related to the geographical location elevation temperature and vegetation characteristics these facts provide a good physical basis to downscale the soil moisture by applying the rf machine learning model with the selected covariates first the 1 km gap filled modis lst ndvi and albedo dem longitude and latitude were aggregated to the ascat grid scale then the rf model was trained to obtain the relationship between the ascat soil moisture and the covariates finally the trained rf machine learning model was applied to the covariates at high spatial resolution 1 km to obtain a spatially continuous soil moisture dataset with 1 km resolution 3 6 estimation of et and rn and the field scale water stress factor the indicator of water stress f h 2 o dimensionless is set equal to the evaporative fraction ef which better reflects the water availability to crops than vapor pressure deficit vpd 7 f h 2 o e f λ e t r n g where λ e t w m2 is the bulk latent heat flux of the soil vegetation unity λ j kg is the latent heat of et mm r n w m2 is the total net radiation flux and g w m2 is the conductive heat flux from soil surface to deeper soil layer in this study a water and energy balance model etmonitor hu and jia 2015 cui and jia 2021 zheng et al 2022 was used to estimate the daily et the inputs of etmonitor include key surface properties i e soil moisture ndvi albedo and land cover and atmospheric variables i e air temperature wind speed air humidity pressure precipitation and at surface downward shortwave and longwave radiations the model equations and detailed description can be found in hu and jia 2015 and cui and jia 2021 retrievals of actual et by etmonitor based on remote sensing data can capture the effects of irrigation thus reflecting the actual irrigation water depths to some extent when lacking ancillary in situ data the performance of etmonitor to derive actual et over nearby irrigated oases of the heihe river basin which has a similar climate and land cover had been evaluated based on the eddy covariance data hu and jia 2015 the results show that etmonitor provides satisfactory et estimates with r2 the square of the correlation coefficient and rmse the root mean square error equal to 0 92 and 0 59 mm day respectively the pixel wise daily rn was estimated on the basis of the land surface radiation balance 8 r n s w 1 α ε l w ε δ t s 4 where s w w m2 and l w w m2 are the at surface downward solar radiation and downward thermal radiation of which the daily values can be calculated by integrating the hourly era5 data α is the surface albedo ε is the land surface emissivity δ is the stefan boltzmann constant 5 67 10 8 w m2 k4 t s k is the daily mean surface temperature which was assumed equal to the daily mean air temperature with soil surface heat flux equal to zero at daily scale in this study the daily time series of et and rn at 1 km spatial resolution was estimated by applying the etmonitor model with the reconstructed ndvi albedo downscaled ascat soil moisture and the era5 meteorological reanalysis data for a heterogeneous region like the study area the 1 km ef is still insufficient to capture the wetness conditions at the field scale the et and rn can widely vary between cropland and the surrounding desert and crops with different phenology thus a linear unmixing method was further applied to downscale the et and rn to 10 m i e at the same spatial resolution as the crop map the linear unmixing procedure to downscale et and rn is based on the 10 m crop classification map the 10 m classification map is used to define the endmembers the procedure contains three general steps 1 calculate the fractional abundance of each land use and crop defined as endmembers using the classification in each coarse grid 1 km 2 obtain the et and rn of each endmember in the coarse grid data by linear unmixing least square fit within a moving window including 11 11 coarse grids as the first prediction of the 10 m et and rn of each endmember 3 distribute homogeneously the coarse grid residual and update the et and rn estimation for each endmembers the basic assumption of the linear unmixing method is that the et and rn of each coarse grid c is the weighted sum of the values of each endmember within the same grid 9 e t r n i 1 n f i c i where n is the number of endmembers f i is the areal fraction of class i within a coarse pixel and c i is the value of class i this unmixing approach captures the general differences in et and rn between crops and the surrounding desert and among crop types with distinctive phenological characteristics mixed in one coarse grid on the other hand it ignores the variability within the same crop types within the 11 11 coarse grids applied to solve eq 9 in other words we assume that the spatial variability of et and rn within the nearby 11 11 coarse grids is only determined by the spatial variability of the fractional abundance of each land cover and crop type improvement in the results is expected by retrieving lst and estimating et with satellite data at higher spatial resolution such as landsat 8 9 tirs and sdgsat 1 thermal infrared images in future work hair et al 2018 chen et al 2022a 3 7 estimation of biomass and yield the daily biomass g m2 day production is the result of the effective use of the absorbed solar energy and limited by temperature and water stress 10 b i o m a s s a p a r ε m a x f t f h 2 o where ε m a x g mj is the maximum light use efficiency for biomass production the value of which can be safely assumed to differ only between c3 and c4 crops according to monteith 1972 in this study we set ε m a x to 2 5 g mj for c3 crops i e wheat sunflower and melon and 3 g mj for c4 crops i e maize based on literature summarized in bastiaanssen and ali 2003 the crop yield is formed through the partition of the total accumulated biomass of a plant to the marketable yield related plant parts a simple description of this conversion is by applying the harvest index and the water content of the yield related component to the estimated dry biomass so that the yield can be expressed as 11 y i e l d h 1 θ e h b i o m a s s where h dimensionless is the harvest index i e the fraction of the biomass accumulated during the growing season allocated to the yield related plant organ θ dimensionless denotes the water content in the yield related plant organ e and h represent the crop emergence and harvest date respectively the harvest index and the water content are usually set to crop specific values estimated on the basis of field experiments documented in literature bastiaanssen and ali 2003 zwart et al 2010 in this study for spring wheat maize and sunflower the harvest index was set to 0 35 0 36 and 0 30 table 4 respectively based on biomass measurements and growth analysis on plant samples conducted in the same study area chen et al 2022b the harvest index of melon was set to 0 64 based on the study of huang et al 2012 the grain water content of spring wheat and maize was set to 12 5 and 14 respectively according to the national moisture content standard for grain storage standardization administration of the people s republic of china 2008 2018 the local practice is to trade sunflower seeds after drying a few days after harvest when the water content is reduced to around 25 the water content of the local melon varieties is more variable 85 90 than that of cereals in this study the water content of sunflower and melon is set to 25 and 87 respectively as an approximation 4 results 4 1 crop phenology at high spatial resolution as illustrated in fig 3 clear differences exist in the estimated emergence and harvest dates of spring wheat maize sunflower and melon while the corresponding ndvi values table 5 are rather similar this is apparently due to the similar fractional ground cover associated with emergence and harvest but attained at different moments in time our analysis showed the spatial variability in the ndvi temporal profiles for each crop was rather limited thus supporting the method to estimate the ndvi threshold according to the typical emergence and harvest dates in the entire area the north south pattern in fig 4 is explained to a large extent by the spatial distribution of the main crops spring wheat mainly located on the south of the oasis shows the most distinctive phenology features with the earliest start of the growing season the emergence date of wheat is generally in early april as shown in table 6 the harvest date for spring wheat is between late july to mid august for maize and sunflower the emergence date is generally mid to late may maize has a longer growing season and a later harvest date than sunflower which is generally till october among the four crops melon mainly located in the downstream desert oasis region shows the latest emergence date at the beginning of june this is related to the relatively higher temperature requirement for the seed gemination of melon plants saberali and shirmohamadi aliakbarkhani 2020 generally the spatial variability in the emergence and harvest dates of each crop is moderate table 6 while the local phenological knowledge does not give any spatial variability on crop phenology 4 2 par and fapar the value of fapar is linearly related to ndvi eq 2 and gradually changes during the growth of vegetation fig 5 displays the fapar values for the spring wheat maize sunflower and melon on days from mid of april to september as an example for spring wheat fapar reaches the maximum value in mid june the fapar maximum is in july for sunflower and august for maize and melon in the peak month when green vegetative parts are fully developed fapar was around 0 8 for spring wheat maize and sunflower and 0 6 for melon the lower peak for melon is caused by the lower planting density and limited vertical plant development fig 6 illustrates the spatially averaged daily par estimated using the era5 meteorological hourly data the upper envelope of the par time series fig 6 suggests a potential seasonal trend under clear sky conditions in the middle of the growth cycle the daily value of par under clear sky can reach 160 w m2 equivalent to 13 8 mj m2 day in the srb in summer drier air higher solar radiation longer sunshine duration and larger daily amplitude of air temperature are favorable conditions for high yield agriculture the troughs in fig 6 correspond to cloudy conditions where the value of par can decrease to 40 w m2 equivalent to 3 45 mj m2 day because of such a big gap daily par is required to estimate the accumulated biomass and the final yield 4 3 air temperature stress factor the daily mean t a required to determine f t 1 and f t 2 is estimated as described in sect 3 4 we established a linear relationship between ta and lst for each station separately and for all stations together the results table 7 show that modis lst and t a observations are linearly related with r the correlation coefficient varying between 0 77 to 0 87 the m n and r in eq 6 in the relationships for each specific station and the ones for all stations did not differ significantly this implies the possibility of using a single equation for the whole study area adopting the same relationship for the entire area only leads to an increment of rmse on estimated air temperature between 0 3 and 5 2 with mae between 0 and 9 2 table 8 because of these results the relationship for all stations in table 7 m 0 94 and n 13 38 was applied over the whole study area to estimate the pixel wise daily mean t a as illustrated in fig 7 the spatial pattern of t a with spatial resolution of 1 km successfully reflects the distinctive thermal characteristic of different land covers and terrain elevation in the srb the cold mountain region shows the lowest t a i e t a 10 c even in summer for most of the region most important the t a map captures rather well the finer details of the temperature variability within the oases and within the desert in addition to the broad desert oasis temperature pattern the lower air temperature of narrow irrigated patches is clearly observable in the 1 km t a map in the desert area daily mean t a can be larger than 35 c in the oasis region under the influence of irrigation t a is significantly lower than the surrounding desert i e between 15 c and 25 c in the growing season the temperature stress factor f t 1 eq 4 expresses a regulation of temperature on plant growth for extremely cold or hot climates f t 1 varies with the optimal temperature and does not change with time the results show that the mean f t 1 in the cropland in the srb is as high as 0 98 1 0 with a standard deviation of less than 0 02 which indicates that the local climate is suitable for agriculture the temperature stress factor f t 2 eq 5 parameterizes how a plant adapts to the local climate with the application of f t 2 the lue is reduced when the air temperature is either lower or higher than the local optimal temperature the f t 2 for wheat maize sunflower and melon during april to september fig 8 is always larger than 0 91 the deviation less than 0 06 with a seasonal trend following crop phenology 4 4 water stress factor as described in sect 3 5 an rf machine learning model was applied to obtain a spatially continuous soil moisture dataset with high spatial resolution using the gap filled modis lst ndvi and albedo srtm dem longitude and latitude as covariates the trained rf model is well calibrated with a low rmse of 0 06 and a high r2 of 0 92 in the original ascat map e g fig 9 a the spatial details of soil moisture are clearly blurred however the main differences in soil moisture among oases desert and mountain vegetation are observable moreover the comparison of fig 9a and 9b reveals that the downscaled soil moisture is consistent with the details of desert oasis pattern within the south oasis clear differences in soil moisture were observable and explained by the crop pattern et and rn were further downscaled based on the method introduced in sect 3 6 and used to estimate the water stress factor fig 9d gives an example of the water stress factor on 16th aug indicating a range between 0 3 and 1 0 generally water stress is more serious in the north srb than the south due to less water availability as indicated by the downscaled soil moisture in addition the wheat area refer to fig 1c shows more severe water stress since in august most of wheat had been harvested already the observed differences in downscaled soil moisture and water stress indicator between the northern and southern oasis are consistent with the allocation of irrigation water which tends to favor the southern oasis 4 5 accumulated biomass and yield estimation accumulated biomass in the maize producing region fig 10 exhibits higher values compared with the other crops the biomass of wheat fig 11 grows up earlier consistently with the early growing season the stage of rapid increase in biomass i e higher photosynthesis rate is from may to june for wheat and june to august for the other crops for c3 crops i e wheat sunflower and melon the mean value of accumulated biomass is between 1000 1500 g m2 the relatively lower biomass accumulation of melon compared with wheat and sunflower is related to its shorter growing season and lower planting density for maize as a c4 crop type with a higher lue the mean biomass increases more rapidly and can reach over 2000 g m2 at the end of the growing season by specifying the harvest index and moisture content see sect 3 7 for each crop type the accumulated biomass can be converted to the final yield fig 13 at basin level the estimated yields of wheat and maize are 6 87 and 8 53 t h respectively which are very comparable with the officially reported data in the gansu development yearbook 2020 the relative errors for the two main grain crops compared to the census data are less than 5 table 9 at the county level the estimated wheat yields of liangzhou minqin gulang jinchuan and yongchang are 6 07 5 20 5 40 5 55 and 6 95 t ha respectively with relative errors equal to 0 87 24 2 9 7 12 5 and 7 2 fig 12 for maize the estimated yields in liangzhou minqin jinchuan yongchang and gulang are 8 86 7 18 8 87 8 25 and 8 22 t ha the relative errors for maize yield compared with the census data in liangzhou minqin jinchuan and yongchang are less than 5 in gulang the relative error is up to 40 the exact reason for the gap in gulang has not been found there is no sign that the growth of maize in gulang county is under higher stress from remote sensing signals e g the value of ndvi the gulang census data for maize yield is more variable during 2014 2019 ranging from 5 98 to 9 95 t ha accordingly this gap may be partly due to a poorer representativeness of the samples used in the census data and the unsuitable setting of the local harvest index in the model to evaluate the estimated yield of sunflower which is missing in the official census data yield data from field interviews in minqin county has been used these fields have received a better nutrient and water supply the relative error of the estimated sunflower yield 6 38 t ha deviates by 5 from the real yield 6 0 t ha since only the regional total yield of melon and other fruits has been recorded in the officially reported data the validation of melon yield has been done only in the minqin county where fruits other than melon only account for a very small portion the relative error of the estimated melon yield 52 24 t ha is 16 compared with the officially reported yield 44 93 t ha 5 discussion the modeling approach developed in this study was conceived to describe the response of highly heterogeneous desert oasis system to climate variability and land and water management the issues to be addressed were a the spatial variability in crop phenology b the spatial variability in crop conditions and their impact on absorption of photosynthetic light c the larger contrast in thermal conditions between desert and oases and within the oases d the spatial variability of available soil water and its dependence on irrigation e the temporal and spatial variability modulated by soil and growth conditions of crop response to available soil water and f the relationship between biomass and marketable yield 5 1 crop phenology in crop growth dynamic models the phenology namely the emergence and harvest dates is usually determined by a set of temperature sums thermal times associated with each phenological stage hijmans et al 1994 to calculate temperature sums a reference baseline temperature must be known for each crop likewise the values of temperature sums associated with each phenological stage and each crop this approach is difficult to apply in the case of the desert oasis agroecosystem addressed by this study for a two fold reason the extreme sparseness of the meteorological stations in the oases and the absent knowledge on the baseline temperature and the thermal times accordingly we explored an alternate approach see sect 3 2 for a detailed description this method considers the specific characteristics of different crops and makes effective use of limited local phenological knowledge to determine the ndvi thresholds at the emergence and harvest dates in the growing season the core assumption is the spatial variability in the temporal ndvi profiles does not modify completely their shape so that the thresholds estimated on the average ndvi profiles are applicable to the pixel wise profiles if local phenological observations were available the emergence and harvest dates could be estimated on the basis of the temperature sums applying to each phenological stage then the corresponding ndvi values would retain the spatial variability of the temperature sums this would lead to an even finer description of crop phenology avoiding the use of the same ndvi threshold in the entire area 5 2 absorption of photosynthetic light fapar the efficiency of the absorption of the par is determined by the concentration and type of leaf pigments which vary significantly depending on varieties fertilization and more in general crop conditions this spatial and temporal variability is hard to capture without the support of multi spectral remote sensing although it is an essential element of lue based modeling of biomass accumulation and crop yield to this purpose we applied multi spectral images at high spatial resolution a wealth of studies explored the relationship between fapar and ndvi daughtry et al 1992 myneni and williams 1994 chen 1996 gitelson et al 2014 we use the linear equation proposed in bastiaanssen and ali 2003 as applicable to multiple crops including the ones in the srb quantitative remote sensing measurements can be interpreted with the support of radiative transfer modeling in vegetation canopies to obtain generalized relationships between spectral reflectance and fapar goward and huemmrich 1992 field scale experiments by tedeschi et al 2011 and tedeschi et al 2017 showed that the melon crop yield under saline sodic stress will be reduced due to the decreasing leaf area and biomass production these studies imply that the estimation of fapar can be further improved by considering field scale soil conditions 5 3 thermal conditions in a desert and oasis landscape thermal heterogeneity of the land surface and the local variation of air temperature is not negligible as a consequence of the large variability in hydrological conditions between the desert and the oases and within the oases proper characterization of spatial and temporal variability of thermal conditions is a critical aspect of a broad range of ecosystems for regional scale applications air temperature is usually interpolated from the meteorological ground stations or provided by reanalysis datasets with grid resolution at 0 1 0 5 neither of these solutions would capture the details of water related thermal conditions in the oases of the srb land surface temperature is a measure of the local equilibrium in heat fluxes in response to water conditions this leads to using lst as a predictor of air temperature as done in this study the estimation of air temperature is affected by not negligible errors table 8 but still relatively small compared with the large difference between oases and desert i e 15 25 c as noted fig 7 possible improvements in future studies include the use of additional periodic components in the hants time series reconstruction or the use of the different method for this purpose and the use of a denser network of weather stations if available 5 4 available soil water in the srb as in any irrigated area the soil water is largely determined by irrigation accurate and detailed data on actually applied irrigation water are rarely available and the use of remote sensing retrievals of soil water content is gaining support zaussinger et al 2019 in the srb serious water conflicts exist between ecosystem preservation and agriculture and between different irrigation zones in the oases water availability varies and irrigation time is different for crops with different phenology thus in this study we applied remotely sensed soil moisture to account for the application of irrigation water the extraction of information from microwave data capturing the water conditions is frequently hampered by low spatial resolution i e 10 km 25 km such kind of resolution cannot capture the heterogeneity in soil water conditions within the oases and the sharp contrast at the oasis desert boundary this is then a two fold problem a soil water content must be estimated at a spatial resolution consistent with the heterogeneity of the irrigated oases and b the root zone soil water content must be estimated the latter issue is addressed in the next paragraph in relation to the etmonitor system to address the first issue we first evaluated candidate soil water condition data products to conclude that in 2019 only the ascat data product could capture the main features of the pattern in soil water determined by irrigation in the oases fig 10 to downscale the ascat data product we identified multiple candidate covariates to develop a multi dimensional machine learning model the covariates are the drivers of the spatial pattern of soil moisture i e vegetation soil surface temperature albedo and elevation see sect 3 5 as shown in sect 4 4 this model could be accurately calibrated and delivers estimates of soil water content at 1 km spatial resolution which is sufficient to distinguish soil water conditions in the broad irrigated and not irrigated patches within the oases fig 9b 5 5 crop response to available soil water soil water availability determines the rapid crop response through the regulation on the stomatal conductance and therefore efficiently influence the carbon assimilation efficiency this response is determined by soil conditions canopy characteristics and the meteorological conditions expressed by the difference between actual and potential et actual et was estimated with etmonitor sect 3 6 using a suite of remote sensing observations including soil available water as described above in this way actual et includes the contribution of irrigation water i e it reflects the actual irrigation water depths this is done by estimating the root zone soil water content using a parameterization based on the top soil water content see sect 3 5 and ndvi hu and jia 2015 the accuracy of etmonitor has been documented against eddy covariance measurement of et at a number of sites worldwide to yield an overall rmse equal to 0 93 mm day and r equal to 0 75 applying to multiple cropland sites zheng et al 2022 the downscaling procedure described sect 3 6 assumes that the actual et of each crop type does not change within each moving window 11 х 11 km2 this notwithstanding the higher resolution et captures correctly the differences between irrigated and not irrigated patches as for example between wheat and maize fields in the southern oasis on aug 16th fig 9d a different solution to obtain high resolution estimates of available soil water and actual et will be offered by a new version of etmonitor which uses land surface temperature rather than microwave radiometry to characterize soil and water conditions this version makes use of lst observations at higher spatial resolution such as landsat 8 9 tirs and sdgsat thermal infrared images hair et al 2018 chen et al 2022a 5 6 biomass and marketable yield harvest index and the maximum lue are the most significant calibration parameters for each crop both harvest index and maximum lue are relatively well known to vary within a certain range bastiaanssen and ali 2003 zwart et al 2010 for grain crops it is usually accepted that the harvest index within the same climate zone is fairly stable for a specific crop due to the high heritability unless severe stresses from nutrient extreme weather and water occur hay 1995 the well simulated wheat and maize yields prove the rationality of the fixed harvest index in the study area for melon the harvest index is more variable between different melon varieties and environmental stress can reduce the potential harvest index huang et al 2012 in the same study area showed that the melon harvest index can increase significantly with increasing salinity of irrigation water this influence should be further studied as regards the limitations in growth rate besides temperature and soil water stress various models integrate the dependence on vapor pressure deficit atmospheric co2 concentration diffuse radiation ratio etc running et al 2000 veroustraete et al 2002 he et al 2013 zhang et al 2016 these models are designed to better account for climate forcing plant physiology and canopy structure in vegetation productivity but have rather demanding data requirements in the srb water security depends largely on melt water from the qilian mountains while food security and sustainable development in the region require equitable water allocation between the southern and northern oasis the model described in this study could be useful to support monitoring of agroecosystem services towards water and food security it should be noted that the issues discussed above apply to a broad range of agroecosystems particularly the fragmentation of land use and the resulting heterogeneity of crop and water conditions the solutions we developed and applied in this study of the srb therefore are relevant to a broader range of land and water systems than the desert oasis in the srb particularly the procedures applied to replace detailed local data on crop conditions soil water availability and crop response to water stress are effective solutions to take advantage of the information conveyed by remote sensing observations this concept fits neatly in the argument of jones et al 2017 who emphasized that data scarcity is even more important than theory limitations in agricultural monitoring and forecast 6 conclusions the modeling approach developed in this study was conceived to describe the response of highly heterogeneous desert oasis system to climate variability and land and water management the modeling system at high spatial resolution is applicable to a broad range of agroecosystems particularly to deal with the fragmentation of land use and the resulting heterogeneity of crop and water conditions the solutions we developed and applied in this study of the srb therefore are relevant to a broader range of land and water systems than the deser oasis in the srb particularly the procedures applied to replace detailed local data on crop conditions soil water availability and crop response to water stress are effective solutions to take advantage of the information conveyed by remote sensing observations crop yield estimation in heterogeneous regions is challenging due to the gaps in local data the problems of both data continuity in space and time and the scaling issue were considered in general the continuous change of crop conditions at field scale during the growing season has been well captured as regards soil properties soil moisture and environmental conditions e g the air temperature the data gaps are mitigated by applying data fusion and downscaling the evaluation of estimated crop yield against official census data and field interviews proves the reliability of the lue based model and the data processing we applied knowledge on soil type and conditions especially on soil salinity would improve the estimation of crop response to water in water limited region credit authorship contribution statement qiting chen conceptualization methodology software validation

24314,information on crop yield is important for food security in particular under the conditions of climate change and growing population worldwide we developed a new fully distributed high spatial resolution model of biomass accumulation and crop yield applicable to a highly heterogeneous desert oasis agroecosystem the bulk of required input data is obtained by retrieving pixel wise biogeophysical variables from a suite of very diverse satellite data both temperature and water stress conditions at field scale are given full consideration while the model was designed to strike a balance between model applicability and satisfactory characterization of the heterogeneous desert oasis system to estimate field scale yield the development of this model relies on three main innovations first the start and end of the growing season were estimated for each pixel by calibrating the high spatial and temporal resolution observations of normalized difference vegetation index ndvi by sentinal 2 s2 msi multi spectral instrument against limited local phenological information second to monitor crop water stress account taken of irrigation a process based water and energy balance model was applied to estimate the actual evapotranspiration et this requires knowledge of soil water availability which is characterized by downscaling the ascat advanced scatterrometer soil moisture data product to capture the dominant features of the eco hydrological conditions in the desert and oasis agroecosystem et was further downscaled from the 1 km resolution third likewise the water stress indicator the air temperature stress indicator was mapped after characterizing the thermal contrast and heterogeneity of the desert oasis system by generating time series of air temperature at 1 km spatial resolution using the modis moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer land surface temperature lst data product in the temporal dimension gaps were mitigated by applying time series analysis techniques to reconstruct cloud free time series of lst ndvi fapar and albedo these innovations add up to a high resolution characterization of crop response to the geospatial variability of weather and climate forcing in the desert oasis agroecosystem the model was applied to the dominant crops i e spring wheat maize sunflower and melon in the oases of the shiyang river basin northwestern china characterized by a rather fragmented land use the high resolution of pixel wise ecohydrological parameters i e crop phenology temperature stress and water stress factors successfully reflect differences of crops with different phenology and location in the oases the relative errors for wheat and maize yields compared to the census data are less than 5 at district level at the county level the relative errors of wheat yields of liangzhou minqin gulang jinchuan and yongchang equal to 0 87 24 2 9 7 12 5 and 7 2 for maize the dominant crop the error on estimated yields was less than 5 except in gulang the relative error on estimated yield for sunflower was less than 10 compared to agricultural census data the relative error on estimated melon yield was 16 this performance highlights the applicability of the model to estimate field scale yields in agroecosystems characterized by fragmented land use keywords crop yield estimation multi source remote sensing data high resolution heterogeneous agroecosystem data availability the remote sensing and reanalysis data products are publicly available the authors do not have permission to share the meteorological in site data 1 introduction the growing world population applies tremendous pressure on agriculture production and natural environmental resources especially in developing regions the global population is expected to reach 9 8 billions by 2050 undesa 2017 to meet the demands of population growth and the projected changes in dietary patterns in the future global food production must increase by 70 100 wart et al 2013 therefore given such a dramatic requirement both expansion of cultivated land and increased agricultural intensity will be needed with further impact on the natural environment the changing climate intensifies the risks of droughts and floods which pose a significant threat to food production information on crop yield under limiting environmental conditions such as due to water availability and quality is therefore important for food security and environmental studies under the conditions of climate change and fast growing population modeling is a vital tool

an alternative way is using a remote sensing data driven model yet with a robust bio physical basis in these models biomass accumulation is estimated by applying the light use efficiency lue concept according to monteith 1972 through the crop growing season while parameterizations are applied to estimate crop yield from biomass lue is defined as the biomass produced by photosynthesis per unit of absorbed radiant energy the lue based method combines the solar photosynthetically active radiation par the intercepted fraction of par fapar the fraction of absorbed photosynthetically active radiation by vegetation and the par utilization efficiency to determine the daily biomass accumulation in theory the lue based method is consistent with detailed biophysical models of photosynthesis under the reasonable hypothesis that multiple biochemical processes combine to determine optimal photosynthesis haxeltine and prentice 1996 in practice the actual par utilization efficiency in the lue based models is expressed as the product of an optimal lue with a number of stress factors the main difference in the lue based models is the definition and estimation of the parameters being used to down regulate the optimal biomass accumulation rate to the actual rate since the bio geochemical controls on lue are still poorly understood for example the casa carnegie ames stanford approach potter et al 1993 takes into account the variation of lue with seasons and biomes field et al 1995 further improved the lue based modeling by considering limitations due to temperature and water deficit the

et al 2000 zhao et al 2005 lue based models have been implemented as a core element of systems for large area monitoring of biomass and crop yield estimations taking advantage of remote sensing data gower et al 1999 veroustraete et al 2002 bastiaanssen and ali 2003 zwart et al 2010 teixeira et al 2013 such systems are also being operated in an operational context such as in the marsop monitoring agriculture through remote sensing techniques system http www marsop info and in the global land component of the gmes global monitoring for environment and security initial operations gio gl van hools and eerens 2015 notwithstanding these successful experiences challenges still exist and were addressed in this study in a highly heterogenous desert oasis agroecosystem with fragmented land uses and complex crop patterns crop conditions must be characterized as a spatial resolution adequate to capture both the heterogeneity within the oases and the contrast with the surrounding desert area hydrological conditions must be monitored at a spatial resolution consistent with such variability to understand the crop response to weather and climate forcing specifically this applies to crop phenology and related biophysical variables to soil water availability and to thermal conditions on the other hand in practice the retrieval of information on hydrological conditions and surface temperature obtained from infrared and microwave observations is frequently hampered by low spatial resolution besides optical and thermal remote sensing observations are often contaminated by weather conditions with considerable impacts on the estimation of fapar ndvi albedo and land surface temperature lst time series reconstruction is therefore needed to obtain gap free essential variables to estimate crop biomass accumulation at high temporal resolution the innovations we deployed to address these challenges add up to a high resolution model characterizing the crop response to the geospatial variability of weather and climate forcing in the desert oasis agroecosystem the development of this model relies on three main innovations first the start and end of the growing season were estimated for each pixel by calibrating the high spatial and temporal resolution observations of ndvi by sentinal 2 s2 msi multi spectral instrument against limited local phenological information the high temporal frequency of s2 msi makes it possible to retrieve directly the temporal evolution of relevant biophysical variables related to crop phenology without using an approximate method such as the application of temperature sums second to monitor crop water stress account taken of irrigation we use a process based water and energy balance model etmonitor hu and jia 2015 cui and jia 2021 zheng et al 2022 to estimate the actual evapotranspiration et which requires knowledge of soil water availability monitored by using satellite observations of soil moisture to mitigate the gap in spatial resolution with the field scale information on crop conditions soil moisture was estimated using the ascat advanced scatterrometer soil moisture data downscaled to modis lst resolution the relationship between the downscaled soil moisture and the predictors i e lst ndvi albedo dem digital elevation model and location was constructed using a machine learning model to capture the dominant features of the eco hydrological conditions in the desert and oasis agroecosystem the et was further downscaled from the 1 km resolution third likewise the water stress indicator the air temperature stress indicator was mapped after characterizing the thermal contrast and heterogeneity of the desert oasis system by generating time series of air temperature at 1 km spatial resolution using the modis lst data product in the temporal dimension gaps were mitigated by applying time series analysis techniques to reconstruct cloud free time series of lst ndvi and albedo 2 study area and data 2 1 study area the shiyang river basin srb is one of the three inner drainage river basins in hexi corridor northwestern china located between 101 41 e and 104 16 e 36 26 n and 39 27 n fig 1 it originates from the cold and semi arid qilian mountains in the south and ends in the temperate and arid desert oasis region in the north occupying an area of 41 600 km2 the srb covers the main areas of liangzhou minqin jinchang yongchang and gulang counties the river water supply primarily comes from rainfall and glacier and snow melting in the qilian mountain area the oases in the srb play a vital role in the water and food security of northwestern china the growing season is april to october the annual precipitation in the agricultural area varies from 100 to 300 mm while the potential et is 1200 to 2000 mm wang et al 2012 thus local agriculture heavily relies on irrigation to keep the pace with the local economic development the water and land resources have been over exploited mainly for agriculture which induced a severe ecosystem crisis water conflicts arose between ecosystem preservation and agriculture and between different sub regions li et al 2007 xue et al 2015 the agricultural area of the srb is characterized by fragmented land use and complex cropping pattern xue et al 2015 the dominant food crops are spring wheat and maize and local high value crops are sunflower and melon crop yield and et estimates can provide meaningful spatial and temporal information for a comprehensive understanding of the water productivity of the region and support effective decision making 2 2 remote sensing data the remote sensing data applied in this study table 1 include the s2 msi surface reflectance sr data products modis land surface products of lst ndvi and albedo ascat surface soil moisture saturation products srtm shuttle radar topography mission dem and a predefined crop classification map the s2 mission was launched in 2015 by esa european space agency to service wide swath high spatial and temporal resolution and multi spectral land monitoring the msi can provide observations with 10 m spatial resolution in four spectral bands i e the three classical rgb bands and a near infra red nir band the s2 system is designed for global crop growth monitoring with a 5 day revisiting interval in this study we specifically adopted the s2 msi level 2 bottom of atmosphere boa reflectance data product https scihub copernicus eu in band 4 red band with central wavelength 665 nm and band 8 near infrared band with central wavelength 833 nm to estimate ndvi and fapar during the growing season of 2019 in the study area the modis land surface products http lpdaac usgs gov including mod11a1 land surface temperature mod13a2 ndvi and mcd43a3 albedo in 2019 were selected for air temperature and et estimation the mcd43a3 data were resampled to 1 km by linear interpolation to match the other modis data products before further processing the daily ascat dataset https land copernicus eu global products swi of surface soil moisture saturation at 0 1 was also used as input to the et estimation model i e etmonitor when applying the etmonitor model the 0 1 ascat dataset was first downscaled and projected to the same spatial resolution of 1 km modis data see sect 3 5 a 10 m crop classification map for 2019 fig 1 was generated by applying a machine learning method to the multi spectral and multi temporal s2 msi surface reflectance data the validation based on ground observations shows that the overall classification accuracy is 90 yi et al 2020 2 3 reanalysis meteorological data the gridded daily meteorological data required to estimate et and absorbed photosynthetically active radiation apar conditions i e surface pressure wind speed relative humidity precipitation downward shortwave radiation and downward longwave radiation were extracted from the era5 reanalysis dataset http apps ecmwf int datasets of ecmwf european centre for medium range weather forecasts the era5 dataset has an original spatial resolution of 0 25 and was downscaled to 1 km using srtm dem stahl et al 2006 gao and giorgi 2008 hu and jia 2015 2 4 ground measurements to estimate the temperature stress factors regulating the biomass accumulation we used the daily mean air temperature measured at three meteorological ground stations table 2 in the oasis the data collected in the period from march to november 2019 covering the main growing season of shiyang river basin were applied to parameterize the relationship between lst and the mean daily air temperature the locations of ground sites are shown in fig 1c 2 5 agricultural census data the agricultural census data on crop yield is officially reported in the gansu development yearbook 2020 gansu development yearbook editorial committee 2021 3 methods model overview in the proposed model to estimate crop biomass accumulation both temperature and water limitations were given full consideration to adjust the optimal crop growth rate to the actual rate the timely and spatially detailed biophysical information needed to model biomass accumulation and yield formation i e crop type phenological development apar air temperature stress and water stress was retrieved by addressing the challenges identified in the introduction to this end a remote sensing data driven framework to ingest s2 msi at surface spectral reflectance modis land surface products ascat surface soil moisture saturation data srtm dem and era5 reanalysis meteorological data was developed remote sensing multi spectral information was combined to capture the pixel wise real crop growth status related to crop specific properties environmental constraints and the field management the model was designed to strike a balance between model applicability and satisfactory characterization of the heterogeneous desert oasis system to estimate field scale yield the proposed model see fig 2 to estimate biomass accumulation and crop yield at high spatial resolution includes the following elements 1 time series reconstruction of remote sensing data 2 crop phenology estimation 3 apar estimation 4 estimation of air temperature stress factor 5 downscaling of soil moisture 6 estimation of et and rn and water stress 7 1 estimation of biomass by lue model and 7 2 crop yield the following paragraphs describe in detail the seven elements of the model 3 1 time series reconstruction of remote sensing observations in the proposed method the pixel wise crop emergence and harvest dates and the fapar were estimated using the time series of s2 msi ndvi taking advantage of the high spatial and temporal resolution the daily water stress condition was estimated from the daily et which requires time series of modis ndvi and albedo the daily air temperature stress was estimated from 1 km lst using the method by alfieri et al 2013 in which time series of modis lst is required the ndvi albedo and lst derived from satellite observations are often contaminated by clouds which hampers their application to observe terrestrial vegetation properties to obtain a spatially and temporally continuous ndvi albedo and lst dataset the method of harmonic analysis of time series hants was applied to the s2 msi ndvi and modis ndvi albedo and lst products to remove the cloud influence menenti et al 1993 verhoef 1996 roerink et al 2000 hadipour 2021 zhou et al 2021 the hants method decomposes a time series into several frequency components based on the concept of a discrete fourier transform considering that albedo and ndvi change gradually driven by vegetation phenology we applied four frequencies with periods equal to 360 days 180 days 120 days and 90 days respectively in hants to capture the seasonal variation of ndvi and albedo in the study area besides the four frequencies reflecting seasonal variability to reconstruct the lst time series we added two more frequencies with periods equal to 30 days and 15 days to capture the short term variability due to possible fluctuations of atmospheric weather conditions cloud contaminated observations are identified by hants as outliers and assigned a lower weight prior to a new iteration in the reconstruction of the time series the analyst needs to specify whether outliers are positive or negative anomalies relative to the current reconstruction of the time series cloud contaminated observations give negative values of ndvi and lst so outliers in ndvi and lst time series are defined as negative anomalies given the high albedo of clouds outliers in albedo are defined as positive anomalies and lower weights are given to the higher outliers which is contrary to the situation of ndvi and lst zhou et al 2016 evaluated the accuracy of hants in the reconstruction of noisy and cloud contaminated observations in comparison with four other methods and documented the generally good performance of hants 3 2 crop phenology estimation the crop emergence and harvest dates identify the period of time available for biomass accumulation during the growing season and then obtain the final yield in the proposed model the pixel wise crop emergence and harvest dates were estimated by applying crop specific thresholds to the gap free time series of s2 msi ndvi this was made possible by the high spatial and temporal resolution first local knowledge indicated typical emergence and harvest dates applicable to the entire area table 3 second the ndvi values at these typical emergence and harvest dates were extracted for each crop from the spatially averaged ndvi temporal profiles ndvi t fig 3 third these ndvi values were applied as thresholds to the pixel wise annual ndvi temporal profile to estimate the emergence and harvest dates for each crop and for each pixel this method considers the specific characteristics of different crops and makes effective use of limited local phenological knowledge to determine the ndvi thresholds at the emergence and harvest dates in the growing season valid for the entire study area this solution was feasible because of the relative uniformity of local climate and of farming practices i e leading to limited variability in the emergence and harvest dates 3 3 apar estimation the photosynthetically active radiation absorbed by the vegetation apar mj m2 day defined as 1 a p a r f a p a r p a r where par mj m2 day is the solar irradiance in the spectral range between 0 4μm and 0 7 μ m where the absorption bands of photosynthetic pigments are located we followed the generally accepted approximation that on average daily par is 48 of the daily at surface downward shortwave irradiance between 0 4μm and 2 5 μ m mccree 1972 the solar energy absorption by leaf pigments in the red band and high reflectance in the nir band make the ndvi an appropriate indicator to estimate fapar a wealth of studies explored the relationship between fapar and ndvi daughtry et al 1992 myneni and williams 1994 chen 1996 gitelson et al 2014 we use the linear equation proposed in bastiaanssen and ali 2003 as applicable to multiple crops 2 f a p a r 1 257 ndvi 0 161 with f a p a r 0 i f f a p a r 0 3 4 estimation of temperature stress factor air temperature t a is an important parameter influencing the activity of key enzymes in photosynthesis which is reflected by the temperature stress factor f t the temperature stress factor includes two terms f t 1 and f t 2 here 3 f t f t 1 f t 2 4 f t 1 0 8 0 02 t o p t 0 0005 t o p t 2 5 f t 2 1 1814 1 exp 0 2 t o p t 10 t m o n 1 1 exp 0 3 t o p t 10 t m o n where t o p t c denotes the temperature when photosynthetic efficiency reaches the maximum value and t mon c is the monthly mean air temperature f t 1 reduces crop growth rate in very cold and hot habitats and f t 2 reflects a seasonal depression of crop growth rate when temperature departs from the optimal temperature field et al 1995 proposed to estimate t o p t as the mean air temperature in the month when ndvi reaches the maximum value in a desert and oasis landscape thermal heterogeneity of the land surface and the local variation of air temperature is not negligible for regional scale applications the gridded t a is usually obtained by interpolating data collected at meteorological ground stations or provided by reanalysis datasets with grid resolution at 0 1 0 5 application of such data will smooth out the main thermal heterogeneity given the sparseness of the stations and the coarse grid of reanalysis datasets especially for small fragmented regions like the srb in this study the mean daily air temperature at 1 km resolution was applied to estimate biomass and yield at 10 m spatial resolution assuming meteorological conditions over 1 km extent did not change dramatically the 1 km daily mean air temperature t a was estimated based on daily observations of lst mod11a1 1 km using the approach proposed by alfieri et al 2013 a linear relationship eq 6 between lst and the daily mean t a measured at ground stations is established and further applied to obtain the gridded daily mean air temperature at the same resolution of the remotely sensed lst i e 1 km much higher than that of reanalysis datasets 6 t a l s t m n where m and n are coefficients for areas within the same climate zone m and n can be applied for an entire region in this study the gap free lst time series generated from the modis lst product and t a observations from three meteorology stations in the oasis area for the whole year in 2019 were used to establish the relationship described in eq 6 thus gap free daily t a at 1 km resolution were obtained for the entire srb and aggregated to estimate the monthly temperature stress factors f t 1 and f t 2 the 10 m f t 1 and f t 2 were obtained through linear interpolation to match the grid size of the other input data 3 5 downscaling of soil moisture as regards the estimates of et and the water stress indicator one of the significant uncertainties is the low spatial resolution and discontinuous soil moisture data at present ascat soil moisture dataset is a long term dataset with a relatively high spatial resolution 0 1 degree and is publicly available thus in this study a spatially continuous soil moisture dataset at high spatial resolution 1 km was generated by downscaling the ascat soil moisture data utilizing multi source remote sensing data and the random forest rf machine learning model breiman 2001 the covariance matrix to apply rf machine learning model includes lst ndvi albedo dem longitude and latitude the spatial patterns of the soil moisture in this arid semi arid region are mainly driven by precipitation and agricultural activities which are related to the geographical location elevation temperature and vegetation characteristics these facts provide a good physical basis to downscale the soil moisture by applying the rf machine learning model with the selected covariates first the 1 km gap filled modis lst ndvi and albedo dem longitude and latitude were aggregated to the ascat grid scale then the rf model was trained to obtain the relationship between the ascat soil moisture and the covariates finally the trained rf machine learning model was applied to the covariates at high spatial resolution 1 km to obtain a spatially continuous soil moisture dataset with 1 km resolution 3 6 estimation of et and rn and the field scale water stress factor the indicator of water stress f h 2 o dimensionless is set equal to the evaporative fraction ef which better reflects the water availability to crops than vapor pressure deficit vpd 7 f h 2 o e f λ e t r n g where λ e t w m2 is the bulk latent heat flux of the soil vegetation unity λ j kg is the latent heat of et mm r n w m2 is the total net radiation flux and g w m2 is the conductive heat flux from soil surface to deeper soil layer in this study a water and energy balance model etmonitor hu and jia 2015 cui and jia 2021 zheng et al 2022 was used to estimate the daily et the inputs of etmonitor include key surface properties i e soil moisture ndvi albedo and land cover and atmospheric variables i e air temperature wind speed air humidity pressure precipitation and at surface downward shortwave and longwave radiations the model equations and detailed description can be found in hu and jia 2015 and cui and jia 2021 retrievals of actual et by etmonitor based on remote sensing data can capture the effects of irrigation thus reflecting the actual irrigation water depths to some extent when lacking ancillary in situ data the performance of etmonitor to derive actual et over nearby irrigated oases of the heihe river basin which has a similar climate and land cover had been evaluated based on the eddy covariance data hu and jia 2015 the results show that etmonitor provides satisfactory et estimates with r2 the square of the correlation coefficient and rmse the root mean square error equal to 0 92 and 0 59 mm day respectively the pixel wise daily rn was estimated on the basis of the land surface radiation balance 8 r n s w 1 α ε l w ε δ t s 4 where s w w m2 and l w w m2 are the at surface downward solar radiation and downward thermal radiation of which the daily values can be calculated by integrating the hourly era5 data α is the surface albedo ε is the land surface emissivity δ is the stefan boltzmann constant 5 67 10 8 w m2 k4 t s k is the daily mean surface temperature which was assumed equal to the daily mean air temperature with soil surface heat flux equal to zero at daily scale in this study the daily time series of et and rn at 1 km spatial resolution was estimated by applying the etmonitor model with the reconstructed ndvi albedo downscaled ascat soil moisture and the era5 meteorological reanalysis data for a heterogeneous region like the study area the 1 km ef is still insufficient to capture the wetness conditions at the field scale the et and rn can widely vary between cropland and the surrounding desert and crops with different phenology thus a linear unmixing method was further applied to downscale the et and rn to 10 m i e at the same spatial resolution as the crop map the linear unmixing procedure to downscale et and rn is based on the 10 m crop classification map the 10 m classification map is used to define the endmembers the procedure contains three general steps 1 calculate the fractional abundance of each land use and crop defined as endmembers using the classification in each coarse grid 1 km 2 obtain the et and rn of each endmember in the coarse grid data by linear unmixing least square fit within a moving window including 11 11 coarse grids as the first prediction of the 10 m et and rn of each endmember 3 distribute homogeneously the coarse grid residual and update the et and rn estimation for each endmembers the basic assumption of the linear unmixing method is that the et and rn of each coarse grid c is the weighted sum of the values of each endmember within the same grid 9 e t r n i 1 n f i c i where n is the number of endmembers f i is the areal fraction of class i within a coarse pixel and c i is the value of class i this unmixing approach captures the general differences in et and rn between crops and the surrounding desert and among crop types with distinctive phenological characteristics mixed in one coarse grid on the other hand it ignores the variability within the same crop types within the 11 11 coarse grids applied to solve eq 9 in other words we assume that the spatial variability of et and rn within the nearby 11 11 coarse grids is only determined by the spatial variability of the fractional abundance of each land cover and crop type improvement in the results is expected by retrieving lst and estimating et with satellite data at higher spatial resolution such as landsat 8 9 tirs and sdgsat 1 thermal infrared images in future work hair et al 2018 chen et al 2022a 3 7 estimation of biomass and yield the daily biomass g m2 day production is the result of the effective use of the absorbed solar energy and limited by temperature and water stress 10 b i o m a s s a p a r ε m a x f t f h 2 o where ε m a x g mj is the maximum light use efficiency for biomass production the value of which can be safely assumed to differ only between c3 and c4 crops according to monteith 1972 in this study we set ε m a x to 2 5 g mj for c3 crops i e wheat sunflower and melon and 3 g mj for c4 crops i e maize based on literature summarized in bastiaanssen and ali 2003 the crop yield is formed through the partition of the total accumulated biomass of a plant to the marketable yield related plant parts a simple description of this conversion is by applying the harvest index and the water content of the yield related component to the estimated dry biomass so that the yield can be expressed as 11 y i e l d h 1 θ e h b i o m a s s where h dimensionless is the harvest index i e the fraction of the biomass accumulated during the growing season allocated to the yield related plant organ θ dimensionless denotes the water content in the yield related plant organ e and h represent the crop emergence and harvest date respectively the harvest index and the water content are usually set to crop specific values estimated on the basis of field experiments documented in literature bastiaanssen and ali 2003 zwart et al 2010 in this study for spring wheat maize and sunflower the harvest index was set to 0 35 0 36 and 0 30 table 4 respectively based on biomass measurements and growth analysis on plant samples conducted in the same study area chen et al 2022b the harvest index of melon was set to 0 64 based on the study of huang et al 2012 the grain water content of spring wheat and maize was set to 12 5 and 14 respectively according to the national moisture content standard for grain storage standardization administration of the people s republic of china 2008 2018 the local practice is to trade sunflower seeds after drying a few days after harvest when the water content is reduced to around 25 the water content of the local melon varieties is more variable 85 90 than that of cereals in this study the water content of sunflower and melon is set to 25 and 87 respectively as an approximation 4 results 4 1 crop phenology at high spatial resolution as illustrated in fig 3 clear differences exist in the estimated emergence and harvest dates of spring wheat maize sunflower and melon while the corresponding ndvi values table 5 are rather similar this is apparently due to the similar fractional ground cover associated with emergence and harvest but attained at different moments in time our analysis showed the spatial variability in the ndvi temporal profiles for each crop was rather limited thus supporting the method to estimate the ndvi threshold according to the typical emergence and harvest dates in the entire area the north south pattern in fig 4 is explained to a large extent by the spatial distribution of the main crops spring wheat mainly located on the south of the oasis shows the most distinctive phenology features with the earliest start of the growing season the emergence date of wheat is generally in early april as shown in table 6 the harvest date for spring wheat is between late july to mid august for maize and sunflower the emergence date is generally mid to late may maize has a longer growing season and a later harvest date than sunflower which is generally till october among the four crops melon mainly located in the downstream desert oasis region shows the latest emergence date at the beginning of june this is related to the relatively higher temperature requirement for the seed gemination of melon plants saberali and shirmohamadi aliakbarkhani 2020 generally the spatial variability in the emergence and harvest dates of each crop is moderate table 6 while the local phenological knowledge does not give any spatial variability on crop phenology 4 2 par and fapar the value of fapar is linearly related to ndvi eq 2 and gradually changes during the growth of vegetation fig 5 displays the fapar values for the spring wheat maize sunflower and melon on days from mid of april to september as an example for spring wheat fapar reaches the maximum value in mid june the fapar maximum is in july for sunflower and august for maize and melon in the peak month when green vegetative parts are fully developed fapar was around 0 8 for spring wheat maize and sunflower and 0 6 for melon the lower peak for melon is caused by the lower planting density and limited vertical plant development fig 6 illustrates the spatially averaged daily par estimated using the era5 meteorological hourly data the upper envelope of the par time series fig 6 suggests a potential seasonal trend under clear sky conditions in the middle of the growth cycle the daily value of par under clear sky can reach 160 w m2 equivalent to 13 8 mj m2 day in the srb in summer drier air higher solar radiation longer sunshine duration and larger daily amplitude of air temperature are favorable conditions for high yield agriculture the troughs in fig 6 correspond to cloudy conditions where the value of par can decrease to 40 w m2 equivalent to 3 45 mj m2 day because of such a big gap daily par is required to estimate the accumulated biomass and the final yield 4 3 air temperature stress factor the daily mean t a required to determine f t 1 and f t 2 is estimated as described in sect 3 4 we established a linear relationship between ta and lst for each station separately and for all stations together the results table 7 show that modis lst and t a observations are linearly related with r the correlation coefficient varying between 0 77 to 0 87 the m n and r in eq 6 in the relationships for each specific station and the ones for all stations did not differ significantly this implies the possibility of using a single equation for the whole study area adopting the same relationship for the entire area only leads to an increment of rmse on estimated air temperature between 0 3 and 5 2 with mae between 0 and 9 2 table 8 because of these results the relationship for all stations in table 7 m 0 94 and n 13 38 was applied over the whole study area to estimate the pixel wise daily mean t a as illustrated in fig 7 the spatial pattern of t a with spatial resolution of 1 km successfully reflects the distinctive thermal characteristic of different land covers and terrain elevation in the srb the cold mountain region shows the lowest t a i e t a 10 c even in summer for most of the region most important the t a map captures rather well the finer details of the temperature variability within the oases and within the desert in addition to the broad desert oasis temperature pattern the lower air temperature of narrow irrigated patches is clearly observable in the 1 km t a map in the desert area daily mean t a can be larger than 35 c in the oasis region under the influence of irrigation t a is significantly lower than the surrounding desert i e between 15 c and 25 c in the growing season the temperature stress factor f t 1 eq 4 expresses a regulation of temperature on plant growth for extremely cold or hot climates f t 1 varies with the optimal temperature and does not change with time the results show that the mean f t 1 in the cropland in the srb is as high as 0 98 1 0 with a standard deviation of less than 0 02 which indicates that the local climate is suitable for agriculture the temperature stress factor f t 2 eq 5 parameterizes how a plant adapts to the local climate with the application of f t 2 the lue is reduced when the air temperature is either lower or higher than the local optimal temperature the f t 2 for wheat maize sunflower and melon during april to september fig 8 is always larger than 0 91 the deviation less than 0 06 with a seasonal trend following crop phenology 4 4 water stress factor as described in sect 3 5 an rf machine learning model was applied to obtain a spatially continuous soil moisture dataset with high spatial resolution using the gap filled modis lst ndvi and albedo srtm dem longitude and latitude as covariates the trained rf model is well calibrated with a low rmse of 0 06 and a high r2 of 0 92 in the original ascat map e g fig 9 a the spatial details of soil moisture are clearly blurred however the main differences in soil moisture among oases desert and mountain vegetation are observable moreover the comparison of fig 9a and 9b reveals that the downscaled soil moisture is consistent with the details of desert oasis pattern within the south oasis clear differences in soil moisture were observable and explained by the crop pattern et and rn were further downscaled based on the method introduced in sect 3 6 and used to estimate the water stress factor fig 9d gives an example of the water stress factor on 16th aug indicating a range between 0 3 and 1 0 generally water stress is more serious in the north srb than the south due to less water availability as indicated by the downscaled soil moisture in addition the wheat area refer to fig 1c shows more severe water stress since in august most of wheat had been harvested already the observed differences in downscaled soil moisture and water stress indicator between the northern and southern oasis are consistent with the allocation of irrigation water which tends to favor the southern oasis 4 5 accumulated biomass and yield estimation accumulated biomass in the maize producing region fig 10 exhibits higher values compared with the other crops the biomass of wheat fig 11 grows up earlier consistently with the early growing season the stage of rapid increase in biomass i e higher photosynthesis rate is from may to june for wheat and june to august for the other crops for c3 crops i e wheat sunflower and melon the mean value of accumulated biomass is between 1000 1500 g m2 the relatively lower biomass accumulation of melon compared with wheat and sunflower is related to its shorter growing season and lower planting density for maize as a c4 crop type with a higher lue the mean biomass increases more rapidly and can reach over 2000 g m2 at the end of the growing season by specifying the harvest index and moisture content see sect 3 7 for each crop type the accumulated biomass can be converted to the final yield fig 13 at basin level the estimated yields of wheat and maize are 6 87 and 8 53 t h respectively which are very comparable with the officially reported data in the gansu development yearbook 2020 the relative errors for the two main grain crops compared to the census data are less than 5 table 9 at the county level the estimated wheat yields of liangzhou minqin gulang jinchuan and yongchang are 6 07 5 20 5 40 5 55 and 6 95 t ha respectively with relative errors equal to 0 87 24 2 9 7 12 5 and 7 2 fig 12 for maize the estimated yields in liangzhou minqin jinchuan yongchang and gulang are 8 86 7 18 8 87 8 25 and 8 22 t ha the relative errors for maize yield compared with the census data in liangzhou minqin jinchuan and yongchang are less than 5 in gulang the relative error is up to 40 the exact reason for the gap in gulang has not been found there is no sign that the growth of maize in gulang county is under higher stress from remote sensing signals e g the value of ndvi the gulang census data for maize yield is more variable during 2014 2019 ranging from 5 98 to 9 95 t ha accordingly this gap may be partly due to a poorer representativeness of the samples used in the census data and the unsuitable setting of the local harvest index in the model to evaluate the estimated yield of sunflower which is missing in the official census data yield data from field interviews in minqin county has been used these fields have received a better nutrient and water supply the relative error of the estimated sunflower yield 6 38 t ha deviates by 5 from the real yield 6 0 t ha since only the regional total yield of melon and other fruits has been recorded in the officially reported data the validation of melon yield has been done only in the minqin county where fruits other than melon only account for a very small portion the relative error of the estimated melon yield 52 24 t ha is 16 compared with the officially reported yield 44 93 t ha 5 discussion the modeling approach developed in this study was conceived to describe the response of highly heterogeneous desert oasis system to climate variability and land and water management the issues to be addressed were a the spatial variability in crop phenology b the spatial variability in crop conditions and their impact on absorption of photosynthetic light c the larger contrast in thermal conditions between desert and oases and within the oases d the spatial variability of available soil water and its dependence on irrigation e the temporal and spatial variability modulated by soil and growth conditions of crop response to available soil water and f the relationship between biomass and marketable yield 5 1 crop phenology in crop growth dynamic models the phenology namely the emergence and harvest dates is usually determined by a set of temperature sums thermal times associated with each phenological stage hijmans et al 1994 to calculate temperature sums a reference baseline temperature must be known for each crop likewise the values of temperature sums associated with each phenological stage and each crop this approach is difficult to apply in the case of the desert oasis agroecosystem addressed by this study for a two fold reason the extreme sparseness of the meteorological stations in the oases and the absent knowledge on the baseline temperature and the thermal times accordingly we explored an alternate approach see sect 3 2 for a detailed description this method considers the specific characteristics of different crops and makes effective use of limited local phenological knowledge to determine the ndvi thresholds at the emergence and harvest dates in the growing season the core assumption is the spatial variability in the temporal ndvi profiles does not modify completely their shape so that the thresholds estimated on the average ndvi profiles are applicable to the pixel wise profiles if local phenological observations were available the emergence and harvest dates could be estimated on the basis of the temperature sums applying to each phenological stage then the corresponding ndvi values would retain the spatial variability of the temperature sums this would lead to an even finer description of crop phenology avoiding the use of the same ndvi threshold in the entire area 5 2 absorption of photosynthetic light fapar the efficiency of the absorption of the par is determined by the concentration and type of leaf pigments which vary significantly depending on varieties fertilization and more in general crop conditions this spatial and temporal variability is hard to capture without the support of multi spectral remote sensing although it is an essential element of lue based modeling of biomass accumulation and crop yield to this purpose we applied multi spectral images at high spatial resolution a wealth of studies explored the relationship between fapar and ndvi daughtry et al 1992 myneni and williams 1994 chen 1996 gitelson et al 2014 we use the linear equation proposed in bastiaanssen and ali 2003 as applicable to multiple crops including the ones in the srb quantitative remote sensing measurements can be interpreted with the support of radiative transfer modeling in vegetation canopies to obtain generalized relationships between spectral reflectance and fapar goward and huemmrich 1992 field scale experiments by tedeschi et al 2011 and tedeschi et al 2017 showed that the melon crop yield under saline sodic stress will be reduced due to the decreasing leaf area and biomass production these studies imply that the estimation of fapar can be further improved by considering field scale soil conditions 5 3 thermal conditions in a desert and oasis landscape thermal heterogeneity of the land surface and the local variation of air temperature is not negligible as a consequence of the large variability in hydrological conditions between the desert and the oases and within the oases proper characterization of spatial and temporal variability of thermal conditions is a critical aspect of a broad range of ecosystems for regional scale applications air temperature is usually interpolated from the meteorological ground stations or provided by reanalysis datasets with grid resolution at 0 1 0 5 neither of these solutions would capture the details of water related thermal conditions in the oases of the srb land surface temperature is a measure of the local equilibrium in heat fluxes in response to water conditions this leads to using lst as a predictor of air temperature as done in this study the estimation of air temperature is affected by not negligible errors table 8 but still relatively small compared with the large difference between oases and desert i e 15 25 c as noted fig 7 possible improvements in future studies include the use of additional periodic components in the hants time series reconstruction or the use of the different method for this purpose and the use of a denser network of weather stations if available 5 4 available soil water in the srb as in any irrigated area the soil water is largely determined by irrigation accurate and detailed data on actually applied irrigation water are rarely available and the use of remote sensing retrievals of soil water content is gaining support zaussinger et al 2019 in the srb serious water conflicts exist between ecosystem preservation and agriculture and between different irrigation zones in the oases water availability varies and irrigation time is different for crops with different phenology thus in this study we applied remotely sensed soil moisture to account for the application of irrigation water the extraction of information from microwave data capturing the water conditions is frequently hampered by low spatial resolution i e 10 km 25 km such kind of resolution cannot capture the heterogeneity in soil water conditions within the oases and the sharp contrast at the oasis desert boundary this is then a two fold problem a soil water content must be estimated at a spatial resolution consistent with the heterogeneity of the irrigated oases and b the root zone soil water content must be estimated the latter issue is addressed in the next paragraph in relation to the etmonitor system to address the first issue we first evaluated candidate soil water condition data products to conclude that in 2019 only the ascat data product could capture the main features of the pattern in soil water determined by irrigation in the oases fig 10 to downscale the ascat data product we identified multiple candidate covariates to develop a multi dimensional machine learning model the covariates are the drivers of the spatial pattern of soil moisture i e vegetation soil surface temperature albedo and elevation see sect 3 5 as shown in sect 4 4 this model could be accurately calibrated and delivers estimates of soil water content at 1 km spatial resolution which is sufficient to distinguish soil water conditions in the broad irrigated and not irrigated patches within the oases fig 9b 5 5 crop response to available soil water soil water availability determines the rapid crop response through the regulation on the stomatal conductance and therefore efficiently influence the carbon assimilation efficiency this response is determined by soil conditions canopy characteristics and the meteorological conditions expressed by the difference between actual and potential et actual et was estimated with etmonitor sect 3 6 using a suite of remote sensing observations including soil available water as described above in this way actual et includes the contribution of irrigation water i e it reflects the actual irrigation water depths this is done by estimating the root zone soil water content using a parameterization based on the top soil water content see sect 3 5 and ndvi hu and jia 2015 the accuracy of etmonitor has been documented against eddy covariance measurement of et at a number of sites worldwide to yield an overall rmse equal to 0 93 mm day and r equal to 0 75 applying to multiple cropland sites zheng et al 2022 the downscaling procedure described sect 3 6 assumes that the actual et of each crop type does not change within each moving window 11 х 11 km2 this notwithstanding the higher resolution et captures correctly the differences between irrigated and not irrigated patches as for example between wheat and maize fields in the southern oasis on aug 16th fig 9d a different solution to obtain high resolution estimates of available soil water and actual et will be offered by a new version of etmonitor which uses land surface temperature rather than microwave radiometry to characterize soil and water conditions this version makes use of lst observations at higher spatial resolution such as landsat 8 9 tirs and sdgsat thermal infrared images hair et al 2018 chen et al 2022a 5 6 biomass and marketable yield harvest index and the maximum lue are the most significant calibration parameters for each crop both harvest index and maximum lue are relatively well known to vary within a certain range bastiaanssen and ali 2003 zwart et al 2010 for grain crops it is usually accepted that the harvest index within the same climate zone is fairly stable for a specific crop due to the high heritability unless severe stresses from nutrient extreme weather and water occur hay 1995 the well simulated wheat and maize yields prove the rationality of the fixed harvest index in the study area for melon the harvest index is more variable between different melon varieties and environmental stress can reduce the potential harvest index huang et al 2012 in the same study area showed that the melon harvest index can increase significantly with increasing salinity of irrigation water this influence should be further studied as regards the limitations in growth rate besides temperature and soil water stress various models integrate the dependence on vapor pressure deficit atmospheric co2 concentration diffuse radiation ratio etc running et al 2000 veroustraete et al 2002 he et al 2013 zhang et al 2016 these models are designed to better account for climate forcing plant physiology and canopy structure in vegetation productivity but have rather demanding data requirements in the srb water security depends largely on melt water from the qilian mountains while food security and sustainable development in the region require equitable water allocation between the southern and northern oasis the model described in this study could be useful to support monitoring of agroecosystem services towards water and food security it should be noted that the issues discussed above apply to a broad range of agroecosystems particularly the fragmentation of land use and the resulting heterogeneity of crop and water conditions the solutions we developed and applied in this study of the srb therefore are relevant to a broader range of land and water systems than the desert oasis in the srb particularly the procedures applied to replace detailed local data on crop conditions soil water availability and crop response to water stress are effective solutions to take advantage of the information conveyed by remote sensing observations this concept fits neatly in the argument of jones et al 2017 who emphasized that data scarcity is even more important than theory limitations in agricultural monitoring and forecast 6 conclusions the modeling approach developed in this study was conceived to describe the response of highly heterogeneous desert oasis system to climate variability and land and water management the modeling system at high spatial resolution is applicable to a broad range of agroecosystems particularly to deal with the fragmentation of land use and the resulting heterogeneity of crop and water conditions the solutions we developed and applied in this study of the srb therefore are relevant to a broader range of land and water systems than the deser oasis in the srb particularly the procedures applied to replace detailed local data on crop conditions soil water availability and crop response to water stress are effective solutions to take advantage of the information conveyed by remote sensing observations crop yield estimation in heterogeneous regions is challenging due to the gaps in local data the problems of both data continuity in space and time and the scaling issue were considered in general the continuous change of crop conditions at field scale during the growing season has been well captured as regards soil properties soil moisture and environmental conditions e g the air temperature the data gaps are mitigated by applying data fusion and downscaling the evaluation of estimated crop yield against official census data and field interviews proves the reliability of the lue based model and the data processing we applied knowledge on soil type and conditions especially on soil salinity would improve the estimation of crop response to water in water limited region credit authorship contribution statement qiting chen conceptualization methodology software validation
