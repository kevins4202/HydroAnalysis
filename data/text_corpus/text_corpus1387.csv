6935,mountainous headwater catchments are safeguards of quality groundwater and hence require special protection against contamination by anthropogenic sources however methods currently handling contamination risk fail to produce reliable results in mountainous watersheds because they overlook the influence of downhill flows and contaminant transport in the validation process to overcome this difficulty a new model based on so called concentration profiles is presented that combines the drastic framework for evaluation of intrinsic vulnerability the categorization of land uses for evaluation of specific vulnerability to nitrate and processing modflow graphical user interface for simulation of nitrate transport this model was tested in a mountainous region of northern portugal the risk of groundwater contamination by nitrate was generally classified as moderate the risky areas are regions used for agriculture and livestock production these activities have raised nitrate concentrations of spring water 15 25 mg l 1 downstream the risky areas the modflow simulations linked the risky areas contaminant sources to actual nitrate plumes contaminant sinks and modeled nitrate distributions at specific groundwater travel times winter plumes could be simulated for the 1 year stress period and hence are flushable in a short time span spring and summer plumes could only be explained by contaminant transport during 10 20 years in these cases even if contaminant sources were immediately neutralized the washout of nitrate would take decades these results may hold back the fulfillment of sustainable development goals related to water and sanitation until 2030 and hence deserve reflection by water planners and policy makers the modeling exercise provided extra evidence that safeguarding the catchment headwater is the keystone of groundwater quality protection in mountainous catchments therefore application of this modified drastic to other mountainous areas may not need to resort to processing modflow the study comprises the main paper this paper and a methodsx companion paper keywords drastic framework groundwater contamination risk rural mountainous catchments lateral groundwater flow contaminant transport travel time 1 introduction in europe concerns about groundwater protection are particularly associated with the publication of a legal framework comprising the nitrates directive 91 676 eec and the groundwater directive 2006 118 ec in the mean time in 2015 the united nations announced the sustainable development goals to achieve by 2030 attracting planetary attention to groundwater protection through goal 6 implementing goal 6 on water and sanitation means achieving a number of targets related to water quality water use efficiency and integrated management and protection of water resources from the scientific standpoint implementation of goal 6 requires the formulation of comprehensive groundwater contamination risk models applicable to river basins and their integration into municipal water resources management plans the formulation of groundwater contamination risk models at catchment scale comprehends the assessment of aquifer intrinsic and specific vulnerability the appraisal of intrinsic vulnerability by the drastic framework as originally developed by aller et al 1985 1987 tackles the protection of groundwater resources exposed to nitrate contamination from diffuse anthropogenic sources being applicable to the rural environment the drastic index is an aggregation of ratings attributed to seven hydrologic relevant features e g d depth to the water table with relevance being quantified through predefined weights predefinition of feature weights unlocked a worldwide discussion because weights were claimed by many authors to be tied to local environmental settings rather than being universally applicable e g the critical review of merchant 1994 and references therein or more recently neshat et al 2014 neshat and pradhan 2017 numerous studies have investigated adjustments of drastic feature weights to local settings namely through map removal or single parameter analyses fuzzy methods logistic regression or eigenvector techniques e g correspondence analysis antonakos and lambrakis 2007 dixon 2005 lodwick et al 1990 napolitano and fabbri 1996 pacheco and sanches fernandes 2013 pacheco et al 2015a many studies focused on the planning of groundwater quality protection have gone beyond the assessment of aquifer vulnerability and estimated contamination risk jafari et al 2016 neshat and pradhan 2015 under both iso 31000 2009 and iso guide 73 the definition of risk is no longer chance or probability of loss but effect of uncertainty on objectives thus causing the word risk to refer to positive consequences of uncertainty as well as negative ones https en wikipedia org wiki iso 31000 in groundwater protection studies contamination risk has been mapped using intrinsic vulnerability drastic combined with hazard mapping saidi et al 2011 or even integrating these variables with the value of groundwater resources wang et al 2012 in other studies contamination risk has been described as weighted sum of intrinsic vulnerability deduced from the drastic framework and specific vulnerability to nitrate contamination deduced from land uses antonakos and lambrakis 2007 specific land uses e g agriculture are likely to produce periodical seasonal spills of contaminants e g nitrate leachates from fertilizers and cause environmental economic or health damage via groundwater resource degradation in case they are distributed over highly vulnerable areas recently risk assessment models and mapping have expanded towards coupling the risk of anthropogenic origin e g the antonakos and lambrakis approach with risks of geogenic origin nadiri et al 2018 in risk assessment studies related to aquifer exposure to nitrate validation of risk scores is frequently addressed authors generally agree on the approach to adopt which is based on a direct comparison of risk and nitrate concentration in shallow groundwater the comparison is made through establishment of a linear correlation between these variables while robust fits were accomplished by panagopoulos et al 2006 in a flat area following this initial study several authors used the nitrate concentration method to validate risk estimates in different topographic contexts in mountainous catchments where this method was applied e g arauzo 2017 kazakis and voudouris 2015 pisciotta et al 2015 shrestha et al 2017 model fits of risk to nitrate were however much less robust than the fit of panagopoulos et al 2006 to overcome this disparity fijani et al 2013 developed the scmai model based on artificial intelligence that ensures high nitrate levels in the highest vulnerability areas through non linear fits between the two variables similar approaches were used by nadiri et al 2017a b c in various regions of iran however these studies lack hydrologic justification for the need to replace linear by non linear fits in the validation process the limited linear correlation between risk and nitrate scores was explained by pisciotta et al 2015 or secunda et al 1998 who related the poor fits to lateral groundwater flows across the shallow aquifers the need to consider horizontal pathways in assessments of groundwater contamination risk using nitrate concentrations was recently emphasized by nadiri et al 2018 although recognizing the possible cause these authors have not yet attempted to confirm the lateral flow hypothesis through contaminant transport modeling understanding the relationship between groundwater contamination risk and downhill flows in mountainous areas is therefore crucial for the correct planning of groundwater quality protection otherwise planners may end up restrict land uses where nitrate concentrations are high paying less attention to the areas where the sources of nitrate are located the main purpose of this study is to present a validation approach based on the relationship between groundwater contamination risk and nitrate concentration in shallow groundwater adjusted to mountainous areas where lateral groundwater flows prevail imposed by the craggy topography in brief this new approach combines a risk assessment based on intrinsic drastic vulnerability and specific land use vulnerability to nitrate contamination with contaminant transport modeling usgs processing modflow graphics user interface https www simcore com with mt3d to model transport to explain non linear relationships between risk and nitrate concentration in a first stage a conceptual framework model is presented whereby theoretical non linear relationships are anticipated for specific spatial distributions of recharge areas catchment headwaters discharge areas and risky areas these theoretical relationships are termed concentration profiles because the aforementioned spatial distributions are evaluated along the catchment s longest flow path subsequently processing modflow is run to verify which theoretical relationships are valid for the studied watershed the pilot study was conducted in three sub basins of azibo river which are tributaries of the sabor river watershed located in a mountainous region of northern portugal besides the validation of risk this study aimed to estimate the time required by contaminant plumes to move from contamination sources to emergency areas this research topic is relevant for the planning of groundwater quality protection especially where the aforementioned time is long hampering the cleansing of polluted shallow aquifers in reasonable time overall the study is valuable for water planners and policy decision makers because the modeling exercise sheds light over the areas of a mountainous catchment that require special attention for an effective protection of groundwater quality 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the territory of continental portugal is encompassed by four hydrogeologic domains fig 1 a namely the ancient crystalline massif the west and south sedimentary borders and the alluvial plains of tejo and sado river basins the study area comprises the sabor river basin that was totally shaped on the ancient crystalline massif fundamentally characterized by fissured aquifers of reduced hydraulic conductivity and yield almeida et al 2000 the river s spring blooms out in the province of zamora spain while the main water course flows through the sierra of montesinho located in the northeast of portugal before debouching into the douro river the portuguese sector of sabor river basin drains an area of approximately 2742 km2 gaspar et al 2016 topography is contrasting among lowland valley plains of dendritic arrangement and craggy reliefs from the watershed boundary and neighboring hillsides altitudes in the basin vary between 110 and 1465 m a s l while the average hillside slope is 14 1 fig 1b geology is characterized by paleozoic metassediments e g phyllites quartzites greywackes that enclose the so called morais massif mostly composed of ophiolitic rocks such as amphibolites serpentinites and flaser gabbros quesada 1992 ribeiro et al 1990 the area was tectonically active during the alpine orogeny when important fragile large scale tectonic structures were defined with nne ssw orientation these and other ductile wnw ese structures control morphology and landscape in the region besides contributing to secondary permeability of the rocks where the fissured aquifers developed controlling regional groundwater flow pacheco 2015 climate is characterized by alternating wet october may and dry may september periods with a maximum water surplus in february and deficit in august pacheco and van der weijden 2002 on average annual precipitation and temperature are p 720 mm and t 12 c whereas evapotranspiration is et 420 mm yr 1 58 of p the differences in elevation help explain the rainfall range of 480 mm yr 1 in the lowlands and 1360 mm yr 1 in the highlands http snirh apambiente pt natural recharge of aquifer systems occurs through rainfall or lake water infiltration across the saprolite layer of local leptosols and the underlying fracture network groundwater accumulates in the saprolite and the fissured aquifer and flows through the loose materials interflow open connected fractures and dykes baseflow working as double porosity system pacheco 2000 natural discharge largely occurs from fracture artesian springs the average spring density is 0 6 springs per kilometer of fracture pacheco and alencoão 2002 the turnover time in the fractured aquifer estimated from baseflow discharge see below is on the order of several decades the azibo river is a major tributary of sabor river fig 1b that drains the morais massif given the substantial amount of biophysical and hydrogeologic data collected from the morais massif by pacheco 2000 the planning of groundwater protection in this study was modeled in three sub basins of the azibo namely limãos assureira and amedo fig 1c the basins belong to the macedo de cavaleiros municipality and define a total area of 37 31 km2 while elevation varies from 735 m limãos to 271 m amedo the average hillside slope is 14 similar to the value for the entire sabor basin soil types are predominantly eutric leptosols 81 land is mostly used for winter cereal production wheat and rye with recurrent rotation to natural pastures olives maize and potatoes among other vegetables are grown in some places 10 of the area and are the most abundantly fertilized tillage agriculture and livestock activities are potential sources of diffuse pollution related to the use of fertilizers and pesticides pacheco and van der weijden 2002 2 2 conceptual groundwater flow and contamination risk models in mountainous areas in a catchment infiltration surface runoff and evapotranspiration are mostly sourced from rainwater infiltrated water becomes aquifer recharge when it reaches the water table the recharge rate and efficiency are controlled by the regolith and bedrock hydraulic properties namely hydraulic conductivity and effective porosity in mountainous watersheds where the topography has a well defined relief and there is a general slope between source and mouth areas infiltrated water is also subject to lateral flows and a parcel of it drains through the saprolite and shallow fractures ultimately emerging in springs and streams this simplified groundwater flow model has been used in various borehole hydraulics and weathering studies pacheco and van der weijden 2012 2014a b verweij 1995 it is now used in the study of groundwater contamination risk with the necessary adjustments portrayed in fig 2 the hypothetical watersheds a and b in fig 2 i represent mountainous catchments laid horizontally in both cases steep hillslopes separate recharge from discharge areas but the basins differ from each other as regards land use and occupation in the watershed a uses such as crop or livestock production as well as urban and industrial occupations are concentrated around the catchment headwaters while these areas are concentrated around the catchment s outlet in watershed b the same differences hold for the spatial distribution of forest cover in the two basins the hypothetical watershed c represents a plain where gentle hillslopes prevail between uplands and valleys infiltrated water in the three catchments will dissolve and transport chemical compounds towards the water table including leachates from contaminant sources such as nitrate no3 from farmland fertilizers possible pathways of infiltrated water are represented in fig 2 ii by the arrows in the plain watershed c because topographic gradients are gentle groundwater flow is mostly vertical and hence the spatial distribution of high nitrate concentrations contaminant plumes measured in springs or dug wells will closely match the distribution of contaminant sources put another way spots of contaminated groundwater will generally agree with areas of high specific vulnerability to nitrate contamination related to the aforementioned land uses middle stepped line of fig 2 iii this general agreement may become less evident if the aquifer intrinsic vulnerability is heterogeneous across the watershed see top stepped line in fig 2 iii for example due to lateral variations in the hydraulic conductivity e g the k 1 k 2 k 3 in fig 2 ii in gentle slope watersheds the spatial distribution of nitrate concentrations will also resemble the risk of groundwater contamination understood as combination of intrinsic and specific vulnerability see bottom stepped line in fig 2 iii and compare it with the top and middle lines unless the medium s heterogeneity is very high within the basin overall this is fundamentally the reason why the use of nitrate concentration in groundwater has been widely used to validate the results of aquifer contamination risk models through spot matching e g al adamat et al 2003 panagopoulos et al 2006 remesan and panda 2008 secunda et al 1998 the rationale behind spot matching does not hold for mountainous watersheds a and b because lateral flows triggered by the topographic gradients displace contaminant plumes downhill relative to contamination risk areas the longer the flow path before groundwater emergency usually associated to longer travel times the more visible will be the displacement in fig 2 ii where flow lines of watershed a are represented decreasing nitrate concentrations represented by the red yellow and green flow lines respectively follow decreasing risk when local l l hydraulic circuits are active but this agreement does not exist when intermediate l i to regional l r circuits prevail consequently the validation of risk assessment using spot matching is questionable in many watersheds regardless of being applied indiscriminately worldwide an alternative strategy to spot matching is concentration profiling as proposed in this study concentration profiles are evaluated along the catchment s longest flow path and represent a relationship between nitrate concentration and distance to the catchment headwater fig 2 iv illustrates theoretical profiles of no3 concentrations anticipated for the three hypothetical catchments a linear relationship between pollutant concentration and distance from contaminant sources is expected for watershed c yellow straight line of fig 2 iv the expectation is justified because the transition from risky e g cropland to non risky e g forest uses occupations is gradual and groundwater flow is mostly vertical in watershed a the potential contaminant sources are located around the catchment headwaters while forest spots cover the lowlands near the outlet in this case contaminant plumes originated in the urban industrial or agricultural areas will propagate downhill keeping high nitrate concentrations longer than if flow were mostly vertical as in watershed c solid black lines of fig 2 iv this is especially true if periodic infiltration of contaminants occur in the risky areas e g seasonal application of fertilizers if flow lines are sufficiently long e g l r the plume can even emerge where land is occupied by forest in these cases the spring water will be unexpectedly contaminated because land occupation forest cover would suggest otherwise beyond this emergency site rainwater has presumably been infiltrated at the forest spot and hence groundwater should be clean in general the concentration profile in watershed a will be represented by a sigmoid like curve with the steepest inclined segment located where contaminant plumes emerge this segment separates two gentle slope segments one high no3 segment between the contaminant source and the plume s emergency site and one low no3 segment between this site and the catchment s valley the longer the flow path the longer should be the high no3 segment the concentration profile shape may vary seasonally to express the influence of the nested local to regional circuits l l l i l r in winter the concentration profile will be represented by a smoothly curved sigmoid resembling the straight line of watershed c and mimicking the vulnerability risk profiles because short interflow circuits are dominant in this season in summer given the prevalence of longer baseflow circuits intermediate regional the concentration profiles are expected to prolong the high no3 segments until the sigmoid line finally changes to a parabolic line l r in watershed b where the transition of land uses is reversed concentration profiles should be mirrored relative to watershed a profiles grey lines of fig 2 iv concentration profiling may not be effective as a validation method where land uses are not topographically stratified because no specific relationships between nitrate concentrations and spatial distribution of uses are expected in these watersheds the evaluation of specific vulnerability to nitrate contamination through land use maps may fail where actual uses or occupations have substantially changed since map production e g due to abandonment of agriculture in a specific case study the application of concentration profiling follows a two step protocol in the first step conventional solute transport software is used to investigate if spatial distributions of nitrate concentrations obtained from groundwater analyses can be modeled as contaminant plumes in case they do the measured distributions will resemble modeled distributions for a given flow time in the second step nitrate concentration profiles drawn across catchment flow paths are checked against expected theoretical profiles fig 2 consistent profiles validate the results of risk assessment inconsistent profiles do not 2 3 data sources and databases the sources of information and data for the current study are depicted in table 1 the alphanumeric data calculations modflow mt3d parameters and alphanumerical results are all provided as supplementary material in four separated excel files one for the vulnerability risk models and associated sensitivity analyses one for the aquifer property and travel time estimations based on spring flows one for the processing modflow simulations and one for the cross profiling procedure geographic data are represented as figures embedded in the text 2 4 technical workflow the technical workflow prepared to estimate and validate groundwater contamination risk in mountainous catchments is the subject of a companion methodsx article pacheco et al 2018 in this paper only a brief outline is presented the workflow is composed of three connected modules fig 3 1 the risk assessment module which uses the drastic framework aller et al 1985 aller et al 1987 to quantify aquifer intrinsic vulnerability land use land occupation data to quantify specific vulnerability to nitrate contamination antonakos and lambrakis 2007 and an algebraic combination of intrinsic and specific vulnerability to quantify groundwater contamination risk 2 the groundwater flow contaminant transport module which uses a stream flow models at catchment scale to estimate average aquifer properties hydraulic conductivity and effective porosity and groundwater travel time b the processing modflow software https www simcore com to model the spreading of nitrate loads infiltrated at high risk spots 3 the validation module which compares measured and modeled nitrate concentrations along catchment profiles with the main purpose of verifying if the measured concentrations can be related to the infiltration areas via advective dispersive transport during a specific time span the three modules resort to geographic information systems the esri arcmap and archydro computer packages esri 2010 2012 namely to perform necessary terrain modeling analyses spatial interpolations raster map computations final thematic maps among other geographic related tasks these computer packages are increasingly used and represent a tremendous advance in the implementation of many hydrologic and environmental studies e g pacheco and sanches fernandes 2016 pacheco et al 2013 2015b sanches fernandes et al 2011 2012 2014 2015 santos et al 2015a b c terêncio et al 2017 2018 valera et al 2016 2017 2 4 1 brief outline on the workflow modules 2 4 1 1 risk assessment module the estimation of aquifer vulnerability is based on the drastic framework aller et al 1985 1987 according to this method intrinsic vulnerability is expressed as function of seven hydrologic relevant features as follows 1 v d w d r r w r r a w a r s w s r t w t r i w i r c w c r where subscript r points to the feature rating and subscript w to the feature weight the features and general ratings are depicted in table 2a the initial weight values before local adjustment are dw 5 rw 4 aw 3 sw 2 tw 1 iw 5 and cw 3 aller et al 1985 1987 feature a s and t ratings were converted from geological fracture density soil and digital elevation maps as regards feature a the lithologic types were firstly given intrinsic vulnerability ratings following the aller et al 1985 1987 criteria secondly the ratings derived therefrom were summed to ratings defined for specific fracture density classes 1 for fracture density 3 km km 2 2 for fracture density 3 km km 2 features d r and c were interpolated over the sub basin areas using the kriging tool because the available depths to water table recharges and hydraulic conductivities corresponded to discrete values evaluated at specific sites feature i ratings were derived from loss on ignition data loss on ignition is a proxy to rock weathering besides the chemical alteration weathering modifies the rock s hydraulic properties which control groundwater flow and contaminant transport altogether the loss on ignition can indirectly be a proxy to groundwater flow and contaminant transport conditions in the vadose zone of a weathered water table aquifer for the sake of adjustment to local settings the drastic framework has been modified through redefinition of weights or removal of unimportant features the single parameter method napolitano and fabbri 1996 redefines weights as follows 2 w j i 1 n w j r ij v i n where i is an unique condition subarea with specific combination of weights w ratings r and intrinsic vulnerability index v n is the number of unique condition subareas within the studied area and w j the modified weight of feature j the map removal method evaluates whether or not it is necessary to use all the parameters in the assessment of drastic vulnerability firstly lodwick et al 1990 defined the unperturbed and perturbed vulnerability indices the drastic index calculated by eq 1 is the unperturbed index v based on n features while the values computed using a lower number of features n are the perturbed indices v then the sensitivity towards removing one or more features from the vulnerability analysis is calculated by 3 s 100 v v n v n where s is the sensitivity expressed in the form of index variation the estimation of specific vulnerability to nitrate contamination l resorted to the method of antonakos and lambrakis 2007 which relates l with land uses and occupations table 2b and assigns a weight 4 to the l parameter having completed the estimation of intrinsic and specific vulnerability the final score on groundwater contamination risk was computed as 4 risk v 4 l 2 4 1 2 groundwater flow contaminant transport module the data on aquifer properties required to run mt3d within processing modflow namely hydraulic conductivity k and effective porosity n e were estimated by the brutsaert method brutsaert and nieber 1977 5a k 0 57 a 1 a 3 a 3 v z 2 l 2 5b n e 1 98 v z a 1 a 3 with 5c v z γ v where a v and l are the catchment s geometric features area volume and length of water channels respectively while v z is the portion γ of v actually involved in groundwater flow defined as effective watershed volume according to santos et al 2014 γ 0 25 for catchments larger than a 10 km2 the a 1 and a 3 constants are retrieved from a scatter plot of ln δq δt versus ln q where q m3 s 1 is the stream flow discharge rate and t s the corresponding time and correspond to intercept y values of straight lines with slope 1 and 3 representing the lower envelope to the scatter points groundwater travel time necessary to date contaminant plumes was estimated as pacheco 2015 6 t 1 98 q a 1 a 3 the running of processing modflow starts with the creation of a new model and proceeds with preparatory steps involving the definition of a node mesh to allocate the results of flow and transport calculations aquifer types e g water table confined hydrostratigraphic units model layers boundary conditions e g flow no flow stress periods time intervals characterized by the constancy of external excitations or stresses and contaminant injection areas then the model is fed with data besides k and n e data required to run processing modflow include top layer elevations set to the altitudes of a local digital elevation model htop and bottom layer elevations hbot set to 7a h bot h top b with 7b b v z a where b m is the average aquifer thickness estimated as ratio of effective watershed volume eq 5c over catchment area data on hydraulic head h recharge r are also required hydraulic heads are calculated from topographic elevations h top and depths to the water table d 8 h h top d in this study processing modflow was sourced with the estimates of h and r as used in the risk assessment module finally it is necessary to set up the volume of infiltrated contaminant v i m3 day 1 and the contaminant s maximum number of total moving particles the infiltrated volume was estimated by 9 v i r a where a m2 represents infiltration area and r the average recharge within that area the modeled contaminant was nitrate with the maximum number of total moving particles adjusted to the largest nitrate concentration observed in the studied area in this study flow and transport simulations use spatially distributed h and b values the spatial distribution was accomplished by interpolating available discrete values at the mesh nodes using the ordinary kriging tool of arcmap software esri 2010 and saving the results as raster files as regards variables r k and n e the available discrete data were averaged and allocated to the mesh nodes of r k and n e layers respectively the transmission of data among arcmap and processing modflow was accomplished through translation of raster maps into processing modflow readable ascii files in the application of modflow mt3d to the study area groundwater flow and transport were modeled using a 2d planar modflow algorithm describing the aquifer as an unconfined isotropic and homogeneous porous medium since the modeled aquifers are in fact fractured media the modeling exercise is valid if the equivalent porous media epm approach e g domenico and schwartz 1998 is applicable the epm approach treats the fractured rock system as if it were an unconsolidated porous medium with equivalent hydraulic properties e g porosity hydraulic conductivity this approach is most likely to be successful when the spacing of the fractures is small compared to the scale of the system being studied and when the fractures are interconnected royer et al 2002 the conceptual model of fig 2 shows a fractured aquifer characterized by interconnected fractures that allow the set up and development of continuous flow lines on the other hand the hydraulic properties were estimated at the catchment scale using the brutsaert method at a dimension much larger than the average spacing of fracture systems that ranges from centimeters to few meters it is therefore likely suitable to use the flow and transport modeling based on the equivalent porous media approach in the present study recently while studying a heterogeneous karst aquifer ghasemizadeh et al 2015 reported that the epm approach is capable to reproduce the spreading of contaminant plumes at intermediate scales with sufficient accuracy for groundwater resources management and the planning of contamination mitigation strategies the same expectation is assumed here while studying the fractured aquifer by treating the aquifer as homogeneous very few parameters are used and the fact that they are estimated here using the brutsaert method means that no separate parameter optimization process is needed 2 4 1 3 validation module in this module measured nitrate concentrations are compared with modeled nitrate concentrations along the catchment s longest flow path firstly the measured and modeled for each stress period are digitally sampled along the longest flow line vertices the sampled values are saved in table format see supplementary material and opened in microsoft excel the sampled values comprise the distance from flow line origin and the nitrate concentration at the flow line vertex subsequently nitrate concentrations evaluated at the vertices are plotted as function of distance this plot is called a cross profile measured and modeled concentrations are represented in the same diagram with the purpose of identifying the best match between real and predicted profiles the process is repeated if nitrate concentrations have been measured at different times e g winter summer in different flow components e g interflow return flow or base flow for the best matches a coefficient of determination is estimated between measured and modeled concentrations to be used as goodness of fit measure 3 application and results 3 1 aquifer vulnerability and risk of groundwater contamination 3 1 1 intrinsic and specific vulnerability assessments the mapping of drastic features within the limãos assureira and amedo sub basins was based on the ratings of table 2a which were reproduced from the aller et al 1985 1987 classes e g features d r t and c or adjusted to local settings e g features a s and i the factor maps and rating counterparts are displayed in fig 4 the maps of factor d fig 4a and b revealed a shallow water table 0 depth 3 5 m and hence high aquifer vulnerability 9 related to this factor vulnerability is especially high d 10 in the limãos and amedo sub basins given the extremely low water table depths 1 5 m the range of recharge is 0 120 mm yr 1 fig 4c being higher in the limãos sub basin the corresponding rating map fig 4d relates this range to low vulnerability in the assureira and amedo sub basins r 1 and low to moderate vulnerability in the limãos sub basin 3 r 5 the map of factor a fig 4f was drawn from a combined assessment of lithologic fig 4e almeida et al 2000 and fracture density maps pacheco and alencoão 2002 the range of factor a ratings is 2 6 the most vulnerable sub basin is the amedo with 4 a 5 but the presence of unconsolidated sedimentary rocks raises the vulnerability of limãos sub basin a 6 in a small sector of that catchment according to agroconsultores and coba 1991 the study area is covered by three different soil types namely cambisols leptosols and alisols fig 4g soil textures also included in the work of agroconsultores and coba permitted us to rate the clayed alisols as low vulnerability soils s 3 and the sandy cambisols as high vulnerability soils s 9 while the leptosols which are the most representative soil type in the studied area were ascribed an intermediate rating s 5 fig 4h despite their location in a mountainous region the studied sub basins are characterized by contrasting topography fig 4i which leads classification of vulnerability in this case to a wide range of t ratings fig 4j hillslopes are steep in amedo intermediate in assureira and gentle in limãos the corresponding t ranges are 1 3 3 5 and 9 10 the impact of vadose zone factor i was rated on the basis of geological information and loss on ignition data estimated by pacheco and van der weijden 2002 for morais massif rocks the maps of factor i are illustrated in fig 4k and l the rating of factor c was based on hydraulic conductivity values k fig 4m estimated from the spring flow data since the maximum k was smaller than 4 1 m day 1 the entire region was rated as c 1 fig 4n the spatial distribution of land uses fig 4o exposes a predominance of rainfed crops 26 natural pastures 16 forest areas 14 and irrigated crops 10 in the studied sub basins the relationship between land use and specific vulnerability to nitrate contamination is expressed in table 2b in general specific vulnerability is low to moderate but 28 of the area is linked to high or very high vulnerability ratings l 6 and 9 fig 4p the drastic map fig 5 a drawn from a combination of factor maps fig 4b d f h j l n spans reduced to moderate intrinsic vulnerability for the entire region 81 v 1 4 5 3 1 2 sensitivity analysis of factor weighting the evaluation of drastic sensitivity to factor weighting was based on the single parameter and map removal methods the weights redefined by the single parameter method are d w 5 r w 1 3 a w 1 6 s w 1 7 t w 1 3 i w 2 8 and c w 1 as expected the largest modified weights were ascribed to the factors cumulating a large representation of high vulnerability regions with a large original weight namely factors d and i for the other factors the modified weights were smoothed to a value around 1 4 0 3 in all cases but factor t this implied weight reductions relative to the original values the modified t weight increased from 1 to 1 3 because the studied basins are amply represented by large t topographic ratings fig 4j overall the modified drastic map fig 5b describes the studied basins as generally invulnerable environments as opposed to the original map fig 5a where some moderately vulnerable areas have been identified the impacts of removing a factor from the intrinsic vulnerability assessment are expressed in the following average s values where subscripts represent the removed factor sd 5 1 sr 1 4 sa 0 9 ss 0 8 st 1 4 si 1 3 sc 1 9 consistently with the single parameter results factor d plays the highest role in controlling intrinsic vulnerability in the studied sub basins because the impact of removing this factor is the largest however the impact magnitude is low just 5 3 1 3 groundwater contamination risk the original and optimized intrinsic vulnerabilities fig 5a b were combined with specific vulnerabilities fig 4p to produce the corresponding risk maps of fig 5c d the risk of nitrate contamination is higher when original drastic results are used but risky areas occupy the same regions in both maps in fig 5c the highest risk orange areas ranges from 140 to 160 being classified as moderate to high in fig 5d it ranges from 120 to 140 yellow areas being classified as moderate the limãos sub basin is potentially the most risky catchment because of the highest average risk scores e g 144 in fig 5c being followed by the amedo 1 2 9 and then by the assurreira 1 2 4 sub basins the spatial distribution of drastic parameters fig 4 suggest that aquifer recharge the impact of vadose zone topography and land use may contribute significantly to the largest risk scores of limãos sub basin 3 2 groundwater flow and contaminant transport modeling before running the simulations the aggregated area of limãos assureira and amedo sub basins was defined as unconfined aquifer and replaced by a single grid consisting of 40 59 cells with a separation of 200 m cell size between central nodes in reality this region covers a 10 4 9 6 m rectangle with a total area of 99 84 km2 the spatially distributed values of h and b are provided as supplementary material on average they are h 0 8 m and b 186 m the estimation of r k and n e was based on monthly discharges compiled from the records of 23 spring catchments located in or in the vicinity of limãos assureira and amedo sub basins the mean values of these parameters are r 1 64 10 4 m day 1 k 2 10 3 m day 1 and n e 1 2 10 4 the geometric features of these catchments are on average a 29 km2 v 18 km3 l 6 km following the allocation of h and b as well as the mean k and n e data to the corresponding grid layers the processing modflow simulations ran for 1 month and for 1 2 5 10 20 and 40 years always expressed as days in steady state mode the modeling of flow and transport could have been run in the transient mode to account for eventual changes in recharge over time it is worth mentioning however that the recharge values used in the modeling were derived from baseflow discharges of springs using the hydrograph method see table 1 which are rather insensitive to short term fluctuations in recharge on the other hand stream flow records of azibo river in the past 35 years source portuguese water institute https snirh apambiente pt to which the modeled sub basins drain do not expose a trend of downward or upward stream flows that would suggest a steady long term reduction or increase in recharge therefore the simulations that were run in steady state mode are assumed to be adequate representations of long term conditions nitrate concentrations were compiled from the chemical analyses of 23 springs distributed around the limãos assureira and amedo sub basins the spring water samples were collected in the winter january 1998 spring april 1997 and summer september 1997 seasons the spatial distributions of the measured concentrations are illustrated in fig 6 a c respectively the figures include the hatched polygons to represent regions with large specific vulnerability rating l 9 classified as high risk areas regardless of the season the highest nitrate contours are displaced towards the catchment outlet from the high risk areas in the limãos and assureira sub basins in the amedo sub basin the highest nitrate contours overlap the high risk areas totally or partially but they also extend downhill where no risk areas were identified it is therefore clear that application of spot matching to validate the modeled results of groundwater contamination risk is inappropriate in this mountainous region as anticipated the modeled nitrate concentrations are illustrated in figs 7a b along with the high risk areas previously depicted in fig 6 in processing modflow these regions were defined as sources of concentrated nitrate leachates derived from dissolution of farmland fertilizers the sites where nitrate was periodically infiltrated into the soil and propagated towards groundwater are plotted in fig 7a i these locations were uniformly distributed inside the risk areas while the number of infiltration points was defined proportionally to the risk area dimension at infiltration the concentration was set to 20 mg l 1 based on the maximum nitrate concentration in the springs after discarding some anomalous values the modflow mt3d routines were run twice because a thorough analysis of hydraulic conductivity data revealed for the 23 springs two characteristic values fig 8 a constant k 31 2 10 4 m day 1 for smaller catchment volumes an average k 6 0 10 4 m day 1 for larger catchment volumes it is well documented that hydraulic conductivity decreases with depth manning and ingebritsen 1999 saar and manga 2004 wang et al 2009 because fractures tend to reduce their aperture with depth larger basins in the same geological and geomorphological contexts are usually deeper basins the reason why they can generally show lower average hydraulic conductivities thus two hypothetical groundwater flow scenarios were presented considering the observed k values the first scenario assumed that flow and transport occurs mostly at shallower depths involving smaller watershed volumes and hence controlled by larger hydraulic conductivities for this scenario the value of k used in the modflow simulation was k 31 2 10 4 m day 1 the average k of black dots in fig 8 the corresponding simulation results are portrayed in fig 7a the second scenario assumed that flow and transport goes deeper and hence involves larger watershed volumes characterized by smaller hydraulic conductivities in this case the adopted k 6 0 10 4 m day 1 the average k of red dots in fig 8 produced the results depicted in fig 7b comparison of modeled and observed concentrations favors the first scenario for example in fig 7b second scenario the modeled nitrate concentrations in the assureira sub basin are always very high except for the 1 month stress period while the measured concentration revealed a nitrate trend with concentrations increasing downstream this discrepancy does not occur in fig 7a first scenario the nitrate concentration profiles along the longest flow paths of assureira and amedo sub basins are displayed in fig 9 a b respectively the flow paths are identified in fig 7a by the blue lines for the assureira sub basin a substantial agreement exists between measured and modeled profiles namely between the winter profile and the 1 year stress period profile and between the spring summer profiles and the 20 year stress period profile in both cases the fittings of modeled to measured concentrations are above r 2 0 8 these results are remarkable because they strongly suggest the transport of pollutants along local in winter and intermediate regional circuits in this sub basin besides they contribute significantly to confirming concentration profiling as a method to validate contamination risk in mountainous catchments it is worth to mention at this point that travel times of groundwater in the 23 spring catchments approach 45 29 years see supplementary material this is additional support for the modeled stress periods and helps justify the relationship between summer and 20 year concentration profiles the results for the amedo sub basin are less impressive but still reliable in this case the summer nitrate profile fitted well to the 10 year stress period profile finally if the cross profiles of sub basins assureira and amedo are compared with the theoretical profiles fig 2 it is clear the association of assureira sub basin to the b type watershed and the amedo to the type a watershed 4 discussion the analytical results for the three sub basins showed that spring water discharged in the winter season january 1998 was affected by raised nitrate concentrations 15 25 mg l 1 around the catchment outlet while being uncontaminated elsewhere the cross profiling of analytical and modeled modflow mt3d results for the assureira sub basin further revealed that winter nitrate patterns can be explained by 1 year underground flow confirming that winter spring water probably represents return flow of water previously accumulated in the saprolite layer interflow the results for winter patterns are not challenging for planners of groundwater protection because the time span of expected contaminant flushing is relatively short not much longer than one year once the contaminant source is neutralized when the focus moves to spring april 1997 and summer september 1997 flow the perception of the results changes considerably in both seasons the results of cross profiling linked nitrate patterns to decadal groundwater travel times which means that spring and summer water is certainly baseflow decadal travel times of shallow groundwater are not surprising and have been reported in numerous other studies bing et al 2017 hemmings et al 2015 the results of modflow mt3d further showed that baseflow discharge is contaminated across the entire basin when risky areas are located around the headwaters amedo sub basin a type a watershed and clean otherwise assureira sub basin a type b watershed thus the modeling exercise provides evidence that safeguarding the catchment headwater is the keystone of groundwater quality protection in mountainous catchments this is a landmark of our study and corroborates legal constraints already imposed on catchment headwaters specifically for the study region the national ecologic reserve of portugal nerp safeguards the so called strategic areas for protection and recharge of aquifers through the decree law n 239 2012 the law is clear about criteria to use when defining and delineating these groundwater resource sensitive areas explicitly declaring the need to consider aquifer recharge and discharge mechanisms directions of underground flow and any hydraulic connections vulnerability to pollution and pressures resulting from activities and or facilities and main uses in particular the production of water for human consumption the nerp decree law guidelines were transposed to municipal regulations namely in macedo de cavaleiros where the studied sub basins are located notice no 11026 2015 in this case the municipal management plan has classified various headwaters as strategic for protection of aquifers but not the ones heading the limãos assureira and amedo catchments no mitigation action has therefore been taken and this is probably the reason why the quality of amedo sub basin groundwater stays relatively deteriorated in general this is the missing link between policy and groundwater quality besides the safeguard of groundwater resources the protection of headwaters is supported by many environmental associations for their critical role in stream ecosystems namely because headwaters support a biodiversity of communities including species of aquatic insects that are primarily restricted to spring seeps and first order channels kaplan et al 2008 moreover in some european union eu countries headwater catchments are being used as references in new generation of river basin management plans because they are viewed as most suited to fulfill the ecological quality objectives required by the eu water framework directive baattrup pedersen et al 2018 the economic value of ecosystem services across headwater catchments is also a motivation for their protection in the united states a recent survey revealed that it represents int 14 000 ha 1 yr 1 hill et al 2014 protection of catchment headwaters in the studied area is crucial because travel times of groundwater are large despite the small scale of limãos assureira and amedo watersheds when spring and summer nitrate patterns are compared with modeled plumes the results are alarming because cross profiles matched for travel times of 20 years in the assureira and 10 years in the amedo sub basins the match to long periods is preoccupying because it presumably implies similar periods to accomplish complete aquifer cleansing similar concerns relative to long term groundwater contamination and cleansing were shared by hagedorn et al 2018 who studied the california s south coast range where nitrogen fertilizer applications have steadily increased since the 1950s the persistent fertilizing coupled with decadal soil percolation and recharge transit times rendered the nitrate impact on groundwater resources a condition of legacy for years and even decades to come although not related to nitrogen other recent studies on groundwater contamination alerted to the inheritance of past activity impacts jamin et al 2012 a positive feedback from the natural system may be the attenuation of no3 n in groundwater through denitrification reactions e g collins et al 2017 our mt3d results did not consider the impact of any reaction on the nitrate concentrations however even if these reactions are active in the study area their effect on baseflow is not enough to bring concentrations down to acceptable levels especially in the amedo sub basin once the nitrate concentrations are high at the outlet area of a catchment e g the amedo sub basin it is not likely that denitrification reactions were very active at the source areas otherwise the concentrations at the outlet areas would have to be low as denitrification ultimately reduces nitrate to nitrogen along the underground path that can be long and last for several years nitrate concentrations in the studied area fulfill the nitrates directive 2006 118 ec threshold considered to be acceptable for drinking water which is 50 mg l 1 it is worth recalling however that concentrations 3 mg l 1 generally indicate contamination madison and brunett 1985 while a recent study found that concentrations over 1 mg l 1 nitrate indicate human activity dubrovsky et al 2010 it is also worth mentioning that the us environmental protection agency epa maximum contaminant level for nitrate set to protect against blue baby syndrome is 10 mg l 1 https www epa gov nutrient policy data it is therefore urgent to set off other initiatives to protect groundwater from contamination besides conformity with the nitrates directive or the restriction of land uses at catchment headwaters already imposed by the decree law n 239 2012 among other initiatives economic valuation studies of groundwater are crucial to estimate the public benefits from improved groundwater quality and to assess public perception and willingness to pay for groundwater protection the first study carried out in central portugal revealed that the willingness to pay is considerable varying between 20 and 30 over and above the current water bill the local residents pay for safe drinking water quality and natural background levels respectively brouwer et al 2018 the dissemination of valuation study results to groundwater users and decision makers through official channels and the media is probably one missing step required to translate scientific results and mitigation proposals into clean groundwater it is therefore time to fill in this gap 5 conclusions the fractured aquifer in the limãos assureira and amedo stream catchments 0 31 km2 in total which are small sub catchments of azibo river basin northern portugal were considered at moderate risk of being contaminated with nitrate sourced from agricultural activities namely through leaching of fertilizers from crop or produced pasture land the threat was confirmed by moderate nitrate concentrations 15 25 mg l 1 assessed from spring water in winter spring and summer seasons these concentrations fulfill the nitrates directive 2006 118 ec threshold for drinking water 50 mg l 1 but exceed us epa limits to protect against blue baby syndrome 10 mg l 1 using the processing modflow graphical user interface the measured nitrate concentrations could be modeled as nitrate plumes the simulations were based on prior hydraulic characterization namely for the sub catchments hydraulic conductivities and effective porosities using the well known brutsaert method a thorough analysis of hydraulic conductivity values suggested that flow and solute transport occur mostly at shallow depths within the fractured aquifer hydraulic heads were measured across the three sub catchments and on average are 0 8 m the modeled plumes are 1 year old when calibrated by nitrate concentrations observed in the winter season and 10 to 20 years old when compared with measured spring and summer concentrations besides linking risky areas contaminant sources to nitrate plumes contaminant sinks exposing the virtues of a new groundwater contamination risk algorithm the contaminant transport modeling alerted for the long time span required to free baseflow discharges from anthropogenic nitrate the alert is even more pertinent because the announced united nations sustainable development goals related to water and sanitation goal 6 are to be fulfilled in a short time span 2030 unless water planners and policy makers decide to implement active measures involving neutralization of contaminant sources immediately it will be very

6935,mountainous headwater catchments are safeguards of quality groundwater and hence require special protection against contamination by anthropogenic sources however methods currently handling contamination risk fail to produce reliable results in mountainous watersheds because they overlook the influence of downhill flows and contaminant transport in the validation process to overcome this difficulty a new model based on so called concentration profiles is presented that combines the drastic framework for evaluation of intrinsic vulnerability the categorization of land uses for evaluation of specific vulnerability to nitrate and processing modflow graphical user interface for simulation of nitrate transport this model was tested in a mountainous region of northern portugal the risk of groundwater contamination by nitrate was generally classified as moderate the risky areas are regions used for agriculture and livestock production these activities have raised nitrate concentrations of spring water 15 25 mg l 1 downstream the risky areas the modflow simulations linked the risky areas contaminant sources to actual nitrate plumes contaminant sinks and modeled nitrate distributions at specific groundwater travel times winter plumes could be simulated for the 1 year stress period and hence are flushable in a short time span spring and summer plumes could only be explained by contaminant transport during 10 20 years in these cases even if contaminant sources were immediately neutralized the washout of nitrate would take decades these results may hold back the fulfillment of sustainable development goals related to water and sanitation until 2030 and hence deserve reflection by water planners and policy makers the modeling exercise provided extra evidence that safeguarding the catchment headwater is the keystone of groundwater quality protection in mountainous catchments therefore application of this modified drastic to other mountainous areas may not need to resort to processing modflow the study comprises the main paper this paper and a methodsx companion paper keywords drastic framework groundwater contamination risk rural mountainous catchments lateral groundwater flow contaminant transport travel time 1 introduction in europe concerns about groundwater protection are particularly associated with the publication of a legal framework comprising the nitrates directive 91 676 eec and the groundwater directive 2006 118 ec in the mean time in 2015 the united nations announced the sustainable development goals to achieve by 2030 attracting planetary attention to groundwater protection through goal 6 implementing goal 6 on water and sanitation means achieving a number of targets related to water quality water use efficiency and integrated management and protection of water resources from the scientific standpoint implementation of goal 6 requires the formulation of comprehensive groundwater contamination risk models applicable to river basins and their integration into municipal water resources management plans the formulation of groundwater contamination risk models at catchment scale comprehends the assessment of aquifer intrinsic and specific vulnerability the appraisal of intrinsic vulnerability by the drastic framework as originally developed by aller et al 1985 1987 tackles the protection of groundwater resources exposed to nitrate contamination from diffuse anthropogenic sources being applicable to the rural environment the drastic index is an aggregation of ratings attributed to seven hydrologic relevant features e g d depth to the water table with relevance being quantified through predefined weights predefinition of feature weights unlocked a worldwide discussion because weights were claimed by many authors to be tied to local environmental settings rather than being universally applicable e g the critical review of merchant 1994 and references therein or more recently neshat et al 2014 neshat and pradhan 2017 numerous studies have investigated adjustments of drastic feature weights to local settings namely through map removal or single parameter analyses fuzzy methods logistic regression or eigenvector techniques e g correspondence analysis antonakos and lambrakis 2007 dixon 2005 lodwick et al 1990 napolitano and fabbri 1996 pacheco and sanches fernandes 2013 pacheco et al 2015a many studies focused on the planning of groundwater quality protection have gone beyond the assessment of aquifer vulnerability and estimated contamination risk jafari et al 2016 neshat and pradhan 2015 under both iso 31000 2009 and iso guide 73 the definition of risk is no longer chance or probability of loss but effect of uncertainty on objectives thus causing the word risk to refer to positive consequences of uncertainty as well as negative ones https en wikipedia org wiki iso 31000 in groundwater protection studies contamination risk has been mapped using intrinsic vulnerability drastic combined with hazard mapping saidi et al 2011 or even integrating these variables with the value of groundwater resources wang et al 2012 in other studies contamination risk has been described as weighted sum of intrinsic vulnerability deduced from the drastic framework and specific vulnerability to nitrate contamination deduced from land uses antonakos and lambrakis 2007 specific land uses e g agriculture are likely to produce periodical seasonal spills of contaminants e g nitrate leachates from fertilizers and cause environmental economic or health damage via groundwater resource degradation in case they are distributed over highly vulnerable areas recently risk assessment models and mapping have expanded towards coupling the risk of anthropogenic origin e g the antonakos and lambrakis approach with risks of geogenic origin nadiri et al 2018 in risk assessment studies related to aquifer exposure to nitrate validation of risk scores is frequently addressed authors generally agree on the approach to adopt which is based on a direct comparison of risk and nitrate concentration in shallow groundwater the comparison is made through establishment of a linear correlation between these variables while robust fits were accomplished by panagopoulos et al 2006 in a flat area following this initial study several authors used the nitrate concentration method to validate risk estimates in different topographic contexts in mountainous catchments where this method was applied e g arauzo 2017 kazakis and voudouris 2015 pisciotta et al 2015 shrestha et al 2017 model fits of risk to nitrate were however much less robust than the fit of panagopoulos et al 2006 to overcome this disparity fijani et al 2013 developed the scmai model based on artificial intelligence that ensures high nitrate levels in the highest vulnerability areas through non linear fits between the two variables similar approaches were used by nadiri et al 2017a b c in various regions of iran however these studies lack hydrologic justification for the need to replace linear by non linear fits in the validation process the limited linear correlation between risk and nitrate scores was explained by pisciotta et al 2015 or secunda et al 1998 who related the poor fits to lateral groundwater flows across the shallow aquifers the need to consider horizontal pathways in assessments of groundwater contamination risk using nitrate concentrations was recently emphasized by nadiri et al 2018 although recognizing the possible cause these authors have not yet attempted to confirm the lateral flow hypothesis through contaminant transport modeling understanding the relationship between groundwater contamination risk and downhill flows in mountainous areas is therefore crucial for the correct planning of groundwater quality protection otherwise planners may end up restrict land uses where nitrate concentrations are high paying less attention to the areas where the sources of nitrate are located the main purpose of this study is to present a validation approach based on the relationship between groundwater contamination risk and nitrate concentration in shallow groundwater adjusted to mountainous areas where lateral groundwater flows prevail imposed by the craggy topography in brief this new approach combines a risk assessment based on intrinsic drastic vulnerability and specific land use vulnerability to nitrate contamination with contaminant transport modeling usgs processing modflow graphics user interface https www simcore com with mt3d to model transport to explain non linear relationships between risk and nitrate concentration in a first stage a conceptual framework model is presented whereby theoretical non linear relationships are anticipated for specific spatial distributions of recharge areas catchment headwaters discharge areas and risky areas these theoretical relationships are termed concentration profiles because the aforementioned spatial distributions are evaluated along the catchment s longest flow path subsequently processing modflow is run to verify which theoretical relationships are valid for the studied watershed the pilot study was conducted in three sub basins of azibo river which are tributaries of the sabor river watershed located in a mountainous region of northern portugal besides the validation of risk this study aimed to estimate the time required by contaminant plumes to move from contamination sources to emergency areas this research topic is relevant for the planning of groundwater quality protection especially where the aforementioned time is long hampering the cleansing of polluted shallow aquifers in reasonable time overall the study is valuable for water planners and policy decision makers because the modeling exercise sheds light over the areas of a mountainous catchment that require special attention for an effective protection of groundwater quality 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the territory of continental portugal is encompassed by four hydrogeologic domains fig 1 a namely the ancient crystalline massif the west and south sedimentary borders and the alluvial plains of tejo and sado river basins the study area comprises the sabor river basin that was totally shaped on the ancient crystalline massif fundamentally characterized by fissured aquifers of reduced hydraulic conductivity and yield almeida et al 2000 the river s spring blooms out in the province of zamora spain while the main water course flows through the sierra of montesinho located in the northeast of portugal before debouching into the douro river the portuguese sector of sabor river basin drains an area of approximately 2742 km2 gaspar et al 2016 topography is contrasting among lowland valley plains of dendritic arrangement and craggy reliefs from the watershed boundary and neighboring hillsides altitudes in the basin vary between 110 and 1465 m a s l while the average hillside slope is 14 1 fig 1b geology is characterized by paleozoic metassediments e g phyllites quartzites greywackes that enclose the so called morais massif mostly composed of ophiolitic rocks such as amphibolites serpentinites and flaser gabbros quesada 1992 ribeiro et al 1990 the area was tectonically active during the alpine orogeny when important fragile large scale tectonic structures were defined with nne ssw orientation these and other ductile wnw ese structures control morphology and landscape in the region besides contributing to secondary permeability of the rocks where the fissured aquifers developed controlling regional groundwater flow pacheco 2015 climate is characterized by alternating wet october may and dry may september periods with a maximum water surplus in february and deficit in august pacheco and van der weijden 2002 on average annual precipitation and temperature are p 720 mm and t 12 c whereas evapotranspiration is et 420 mm yr 1 58 of p the differences in elevation help explain the rainfall range of 480 mm yr 1 in the lowlands and 1360 mm yr 1 in the highlands http snirh apambiente pt natural recharge of aquifer systems occurs through rainfall or lake water infiltration across the saprolite layer of local leptosols and the underlying fracture network groundwater accumulates in the saprolite and the fissured aquifer and flows through the loose materials interflow open connected fractures and dykes baseflow working as double porosity system pacheco 2000 natural discharge largely occurs from fracture artesian springs the average spring density is 0 6 springs per kilometer of fracture pacheco and alencoão 2002 the turnover time in the fractured aquifer estimated from baseflow discharge see below is on the order of several decades the azibo river is a major tributary of sabor river fig 1b that drains the morais massif given the substantial amount of biophysical and hydrogeologic data collected from the morais massif by pacheco 2000 the planning of groundwater protection in this study was modeled in three sub basins of the azibo namely limãos assureira and amedo fig 1c the basins belong to the macedo de cavaleiros municipality and define a total area of 37 31 km2 while elevation varies from 735 m limãos to 271 m amedo the average hillside slope is 14 similar to the value for the entire sabor basin soil types are predominantly eutric leptosols 81 land is mostly used for winter cereal production wheat and rye with recurrent rotation to natural pastures olives maize and potatoes among other vegetables are grown in some places 10 of the area and are the most abundantly fertilized tillage agriculture and livestock activities are potential sources of diffuse pollution related to the use of fertilizers and pesticides pacheco and van der weijden 2002 2 2 conceptual groundwater flow and contamination risk models in mountainous areas in a catchment infiltration surface runoff and evapotranspiration are mostly sourced from rainwater infiltrated water becomes aquifer recharge when it reaches the water table the recharge rate and efficiency are controlled by the regolith and bedrock hydraulic properties namely hydraulic conductivity and effective porosity in mountainous watersheds where the topography has a well defined relief and there is a general slope between source and mouth areas infiltrated water is also subject to lateral flows and a parcel of it drains through the saprolite and shallow fractures ultimately emerging in springs and streams this simplified groundwater flow model has been used in various borehole hydraulics and weathering studies pacheco and van der weijden 2012 2014a b verweij 1995 it is now used in the study of groundwater contamination risk with the necessary adjustments portrayed in fig 2 the hypothetical watersheds a and b in fig 2 i represent mountainous catchments laid horizontally in both cases steep hillslopes separate recharge from discharge areas but the basins differ from each other as regards land use and occupation in the watershed a uses such as crop or livestock production as well as urban and industrial occupations are concentrated around the catchment headwaters while these areas are concentrated around the catchment s outlet in watershed b the same differences hold for the spatial distribution of forest cover in the two basins the hypothetical watershed c represents a plain where gentle hillslopes prevail between uplands and valleys infiltrated water in the three catchments will dissolve and transport chemical compounds towards the water table including leachates from contaminant sources such as nitrate no3 from farmland fertilizers possible pathways of infiltrated water are represented in fig 2 ii by the arrows in the plain watershed c because topographic gradients are gentle groundwater flow is mostly vertical and hence the spatial distribution of high nitrate concentrations contaminant plumes measured in springs or dug wells will closely match the distribution of contaminant sources put another way spots of contaminated groundwater will generally agree with areas of high specific vulnerability to nitrate contamination related to the aforementioned land uses middle stepped line of fig 2 iii this general agreement may become less evident if the aquifer intrinsic vulnerability is heterogeneous across the watershed see top stepped line in fig 2 iii for example due to lateral variations in the hydraulic conductivity e g the k 1 k 2 k 3 in fig 2 ii in gentle slope watersheds the spatial distribution of nitrate concentrations will also resemble the risk of groundwater contamination understood as combination of intrinsic and specific vulnerability see bottom stepped line in fig 2 iii and compare it with the top and middle lines unless the medium s heterogeneity is very high within the basin overall this is fundamentally the reason why the use of nitrate concentration in groundwater has been widely used to validate the results of aquifer contamination risk models through spot matching e g al adamat et al 2003 panagopoulos et al 2006 remesan and panda 2008 secunda et al 1998 the rationale behind spot matching does not hold for mountainous watersheds a and b because lateral flows triggered by the topographic gradients displace contaminant plumes downhill relative to contamination risk areas the longer the flow path before groundwater emergency usually associated to longer travel times the more visible will be the displacement in fig 2 ii where flow lines of watershed a are represented decreasing nitrate concentrations represented by the red yellow and green flow lines respectively follow decreasing risk when local l l hydraulic circuits are active but this agreement does not exist when intermediate l i to regional l r circuits prevail consequently the validation of risk assessment using spot matching is questionable in many watersheds regardless of being applied indiscriminately worldwide an alternative strategy to spot matching is concentration profiling as proposed in this study concentration profiles are evaluated along the catchment s longest flow path and represent a relationship between nitrate concentration and distance to the catchment headwater fig 2 iv illustrates theoretical profiles of no3 concentrations anticipated for the three hypothetical catchments a linear relationship between pollutant concentration and distance from contaminant sources is expected for watershed c yellow straight line of fig 2 iv the expectation is justified because the transition from risky e g cropland to non risky e g forest uses occupations is gradual and groundwater flow is mostly vertical in watershed a the potential contaminant sources are located around the catchment headwaters while forest spots cover the lowlands near the outlet in this case contaminant plumes originated in the urban industrial or agricultural areas will propagate downhill keeping high nitrate concentrations longer than if flow were mostly vertical as in watershed c solid black lines of fig 2 iv this is especially true if periodic infiltration of contaminants occur in the risky areas e g seasonal application of fertilizers if flow lines are sufficiently long e g l r the plume can even emerge where land is occupied by forest in these cases the spring water will be unexpectedly contaminated because land occupation forest cover would suggest otherwise beyond this emergency site rainwater has presumably been infiltrated at the forest spot and hence groundwater should be clean in general the concentration profile in watershed a will be represented by a sigmoid like curve with the steepest inclined segment located where contaminant plumes emerge this segment separates two gentle slope segments one high no3 segment between the contaminant source and the plume s emergency site and one low no3 segment between this site and the catchment s valley the longer the flow path the longer should be the high no3 segment the concentration profile shape may vary seasonally to express the influence of the nested local to regional circuits l l l i l r in winter the concentration profile will be represented by a smoothly curved sigmoid resembling the straight line of watershed c and mimicking the vulnerability risk profiles because short interflow circuits are dominant in this season in summer given the prevalence of longer baseflow circuits intermediate regional the concentration profiles are expected to prolong the high no3 segments until the sigmoid line finally changes to a parabolic line l r in watershed b where the transition of land uses is reversed concentration profiles should be mirrored relative to watershed a profiles grey lines of fig 2 iv concentration profiling may not be effective as a validation method where land uses are not topographically stratified because no specific relationships between nitrate concentrations and spatial distribution of uses are expected in these watersheds the evaluation of specific vulnerability to nitrate contamination through land use maps may fail where actual uses or occupations have substantially changed since map production e g due to abandonment of agriculture in a specific case study the application of concentration profiling follows a two step protocol in the first step conventional solute transport software is used to investigate if spatial distributions of nitrate concentrations obtained from groundwater analyses can be modeled as contaminant plumes in case they do the measured distributions will resemble modeled distributions for a given flow time in the second step nitrate concentration profiles drawn across catchment flow paths are checked against expected theoretical profiles fig 2 consistent profiles validate the results of risk assessment inconsistent profiles do not 2 3 data sources and

prepared to estimate and validate groundwater contamination risk in mountainous catchments is the subject of a companion methodsx article pacheco et al 2018 in this paper only a brief outline is presented the workflow is composed of three connected modules fig 3 1 the risk assessment module which uses the drastic framework aller et al 1985 aller et al 1987 to quantify aquifer intrinsic vulnerability land use land occupation data to quantify specific vulnerability to nitrate contamination antonakos and lambrakis 2007 and an algebraic combination of intrinsic and specific vulnerability to quantify groundwater contamination risk 2 the groundwater flow contaminant transport module which uses a stream flow models at catchment scale to estimate average aquifer properties hydraulic conductivity and effective porosity and groundwater travel time b the processing modflow software https www simcore com to model the spreading of nitrate loads infiltrated at high risk spots 3 the validation module which compares measured and modeled nitrate concentrations along catchment profiles with the main purpose of verifying if the measured concentrations can be related to the infiltration areas via advective dispersive transport during a specific time span the three modules resort to geographic information systems the esri arcmap and archydro computer packages esri 2010 2012 namely to perform necessary terrain modeling analyses spatial interpolations raster map computations final thematic maps among other geographic related tasks these computer packages are increasingly used and represent a tremendous advance in the implementation of many hydrologic and environmental studies e g pacheco and sanches fernandes 2016 pacheco et al 2013 2015b sanches fernandes et al 2011 2012 2014 2015 santos et al 2015a b c terêncio et al 2017 2018 valera et al 2016 2017 2 4 1 brief outline on the workflow modules 2 4 1 1 risk assessment module the estimation of aquifer vulnerability is based on the drastic framework aller et al 1985 1987 according to this method intrinsic vulnerability is expressed as function of seven hydrologic relevant features as follows 1 v d w d r r w r r a w a r s w s r t w t r i w i r c w c r where subscript r points to the feature rating and subscript w to the feature weight the features and general ratings are depicted in table 2a the initial weight values before local adjustment are dw 5 rw 4 aw 3 sw 2 tw 1 iw 5 and cw 3 aller et al 1985 1987 feature a s and t ratings were converted from geological fracture density soil and digital elevation maps as regards feature a the lithologic types were firstly given intrinsic vulnerability ratings following the aller et al 1985 1987 criteria secondly the ratings derived therefrom were summed to ratings defined for specific fracture density classes 1 for fracture density 3 km km 2 2 for fracture density 3 km km 2 features d r and c were interpolated over the sub basin areas using the kriging tool because the available depths to water table recharges and hydraulic conductivities corresponded to discrete values evaluated at specific sites feature i ratings were derived from loss on ignition data loss on ignition is a proxy to rock weathering besides the chemical alteration weathering modifies the rock s hydraulic properties which control groundwater flow and contaminant transport altogether the loss on ignition can indirectly be a proxy to groundwater flow and contaminant transport conditions in the vadose zone of a weathered water table aquifer for the sake of adjustment to local settings the drastic framework has been modified through redefinition of weights or removal of unimportant features the single parameter method napolitano and fabbri 1996 redefines weights as follows 2 w j i 1 n w j r ij v i n where i is an unique condition subarea with specific combination of weights w ratings r and intrinsic vulnerability index v n is the number of unique condition subareas within the studied area and w j the modified weight of feature j the map removal method evaluates whether or not it is necessary to use all the parameters in the assessment of drastic vulnerability firstly lodwick et al 1990 defined the unperturbed and perturbed vulnerability indices the drastic index calculated by eq 1 is the unperturbed index v based on n features while the values computed using a lower number of features n are the perturbed indices v then the sensitivity towards removing one or more features from the vulnerability analysis is calculated by 3 s 100 v v n v n where s is the sensitivity expressed in the form of index variation the estimation of specific vulnerability to nitrate contamination l resorted to the method of antonakos and lambrakis 2007 which relates l with land uses and occupations table 2b and assigns a weight 4 to the l parameter having completed the estimation of intrinsic and specific vulnerability the final score on groundwater contamination risk was computed as 4 risk v 4 l 2 4 1 2 groundwater flow contaminant transport module the data on aquifer properties required to run mt3d within processing modflow namely hydraulic conductivity k and effective porosity n e were estimated by the brutsaert method brutsaert and nieber 1977 5a k 0 57 a 1 a 3 a 3 v z 2 l 2 5b n e 1 98 v z a 1 a 3 with 5c v z γ v where a v and l are the catchment s geometric features area volume and length of water channels respectively while v z is the portion γ of v actually involved in groundwater flow defined as effective watershed volume according to santos et al 2014 γ 0 25 for catchments larger than a 10 km2 the a 1 and a 3 constants are retrieved from a scatter plot of ln δq δt versus ln q where q m3 s 1 is the stream flow discharge rate and t s the corresponding time and correspond to intercept y values of straight lines with slope 1 and 3 representing the lower envelope to the scatter points groundwater travel time necessary to date contaminant plumes was estimated as pacheco 2015 6 t 1 98 q a 1 a 3 the running of processing modflow starts with the creation of a new model and proceeds with preparatory steps involving the definition of a node mesh to allocate the results of flow and transport calculations aquifer types e g water table confined hydrostratigraphic units model layers boundary conditions e g flow no flow stress periods time intervals characterized by the constancy of external excitations or stresses and contaminant injection areas then the model is fed with data besides k and n e data required to run processing modflow include top layer elevations set to the altitudes of a local digital elevation model htop and bottom layer elevations hbot set to 7a h bot h top b with 7b b v z a where b m is the average aquifer thickness estimated as ratio of effective watershed volume eq 5c over catchment area data on hydraulic head h recharge r are also required hydraulic heads are calculated from topographic elevations h top and depths to the water table d 8 h h top d in this study processing modflow was sourced with the estimates of h and r as used in the risk assessment module finally it is necessary to set up the volume of infiltrated contaminant v i m3 day 1 and the contaminant s maximum number of total moving particles the infiltrated volume was estimated by 9 v i r a where a m2 represents infiltration area and r the average recharge within that area the modeled contaminant was nitrate with the maximum number of total moving particles adjusted to the largest nitrate concentration observed in the studied area in this study flow and transport simulations use spatially distributed h and b values the spatial distribution was accomplished by interpolating available discrete values at the mesh nodes using the ordinary kriging tool of arcmap software esri 2010 and saving the results as raster files as regards variables r k and n e the available discrete data were averaged and allocated to the mesh nodes of r k and n e layers respectively the transmission of data among arcmap and processing modflow was accomplished through translation of raster maps into processing modflow readable ascii files in the application of modflow mt3d to the study area groundwater flow and transport were modeled using a 2d planar modflow algorithm describing the aquifer as an unconfined isotropic and homogeneous porous medium since the modeled aquifers are in fact fractured media the modeling exercise is valid if the equivalent porous media epm approach e g domenico and schwartz 1998 is applicable the epm approach treats the fractured rock system as if it were an unconsolidated porous medium with equivalent hydraulic properties e g porosity hydraulic conductivity this approach is most likely to be successful when the spacing of the fractures is small compared to the scale of the system being studied and when the fractures are interconnected royer et al 2002 the conceptual model of fig 2 shows a fractured aquifer characterized by interconnected fractures that allow the set up and development of continuous flow lines on the other hand the hydraulic properties were estimated at the catchment scale using the brutsaert method at a dimension much larger than the average spacing of fracture systems that ranges from centimeters to few meters it is therefore likely suitable to use the flow and transport modeling based on the equivalent porous media approach in the present study recently while studying a heterogeneous karst aquifer ghasemizadeh et al 2015 reported that the epm approach is capable to reproduce the spreading of contaminant plumes at intermediate scales with sufficient accuracy for groundwater resources management and the planning of contamination mitigation strategies the same expectation is assumed here while studying the fractured aquifer by treating the aquifer as homogeneous very few parameters are used and the fact that they are estimated here using the brutsaert method means that no separate parameter optimization process is needed 2 4 1 3 validation module in this module measured nitrate concentrations are compared with modeled nitrate concentrations along the catchment s longest flow path firstly the measured and modeled for each stress period are digitally sampled along the longest flow line vertices the sampled values are saved in table format see supplementary material and opened in microsoft excel the sampled values comprise the distance from flow line origin and the nitrate concentration at the flow line vertex subsequently nitrate concentrations evaluated at the vertices are plotted as function of distance this plot is called a cross profile measured and modeled concentrations are represented in the same diagram with the purpose of identifying the best match between real and predicted profiles the process is repeated if nitrate concentrations have been measured at different times e g winter summer in different flow components e g interflow return flow or base flow for the best matches a coefficient of determination is estimated between measured and modeled concentrations to be used as goodness of fit measure 3 application and results 3 1 aquifer vulnerability and risk of groundwater contamination 3 1 1 intrinsic and specific vulnerability assessments the mapping of drastic features within the limãos assureira and amedo sub basins was based on the ratings of table 2a which were reproduced from the aller et al 1985 1987 classes e g features d r t and c or adjusted to local settings e g features a s and i the factor maps and rating counterparts are displayed in fig 4 the maps of factor d fig 4a and b revealed a shallow water table 0 depth 3 5 m and hence high aquifer vulnerability 9 related to this factor vulnerability is especially high d 10 in the limãos and amedo sub basins given the extremely low water table depths 1 5 m the range of recharge is 0 120 mm yr 1 fig 4c being higher in the limãos sub basin the corresponding rating map fig 4d relates this range to low vulnerability in the assureira and amedo sub basins r 1 and low to moderate vulnerability in the limãos sub basin 3 r 5 the map of factor a fig 4f was drawn from a combined assessment of lithologic fig 4e almeida et al 2000 and fracture density maps pacheco and alencoão 2002 the range of factor a ratings is 2 6 the most vulnerable sub basin is the amedo with 4 a 5 but the presence of unconsolidated sedimentary rocks raises the vulnerability of limãos sub basin a 6 in a small sector of that catchment according to agroconsultores and coba 1991 the study area is covered by three different soil types namely cambisols leptosols and alisols fig 4g soil textures also included in the work of agroconsultores and coba permitted us to rate the clayed alisols as low vulnerability soils s 3 and the sandy cambisols as high vulnerability soils s 9 while the leptosols which are the most representative soil type in the studied area were ascribed an intermediate rating s 5 fig 4h despite their location in a mountainous region the studied sub basins are characterized by contrasting topography fig 4i which leads classification of vulnerability in this case to a wide range of t ratings fig 4j hillslopes are steep in amedo intermediate in assureira and gentle in limãos the corresponding t ranges are 1 3 3 5 and 9 10 the impact of vadose zone factor i was rated on the basis of geological information and loss on ignition data estimated by pacheco and van der weijden 2002 for morais massif rocks the maps of factor i are illustrated in fig 4k and l the rating of factor c was based on hydraulic conductivity values k fig 4m estimated from the spring flow data since the maximum k was smaller than 4 1 m day 1 the entire region was rated as c 1 fig 4n the spatial distribution of land uses fig 4o exposes a predominance of rainfed crops 26 natural pastures 16 forest areas 14 and irrigated crops 10 in the studied sub basins the relationship between land use and specific vulnerability to nitrate contamination is expressed in table 2b in general specific vulnerability is low to moderate but 28 of the area is linked to high or very high vulnerability ratings l 6 and 9 fig 4p the drastic map fig 5 a drawn from a combination of factor maps fig 4b d f h j l n spans reduced to moderate intrinsic vulnerability for the entire region 81 v 1 4 5 3 1 2 sensitivity analysis of factor weighting the evaluation of drastic sensitivity to factor weighting was based on the single parameter and map removal methods the weights redefined by the single parameter method are d w 5 r w 1 3 a w 1 6 s w 1 7 t w 1 3 i w 2 8 and c w 1 as expected the largest modified weights were ascribed to the factors cumulating a large representation of high vulnerability regions with a large original weight namely factors d and i for the other factors the modified weights were smoothed to a value around 1 4 0 3 in all cases but factor t this implied weight reductions relative to the original values the modified t weight increased from 1 to 1 3 because the studied basins are amply represented by large t topographic ratings fig 4j overall the modified drastic map fig 5b describes the studied basins as generally invulnerable environments as opposed to the original map fig 5a where some moderately vulnerable areas have been identified the impacts of removing a factor from the intrinsic vulnerability assessment are expressed in the following average s values where subscripts represent the removed factor sd 5 1 sr 1 4 sa 0 9 ss 0 8 st 1 4 si 1 3 sc 1 9 consistently with the single parameter results factor d plays the highest role in controlling intrinsic vulnerability in the studied sub basins because the impact of removing this factor is the largest however the impact magnitude is low just 5 3 1 3 groundwater contamination risk the original and optimized intrinsic vulnerabilities fig 5a b were combined with specific vulnerabilities fig 4p to produce the corresponding risk maps of fig 5c d the risk of nitrate contamination is higher when original drastic results are used but risky areas occupy the same regions in both maps in fig 5c the highest risk orange areas ranges from 140 to 160 being classified as moderate to high in fig 5d it ranges from 120 to 140 yellow areas being classified as moderate the limãos sub basin is potentially the most risky catchment because of the highest average risk scores e g 144 in fig 5c being followed by the amedo 1 2 9 and then by the assurreira 1 2 4 sub basins the spatial distribution of drastic parameters fig 4 suggest that aquifer recharge the impact of vadose zone topography and land use may contribute significantly to the largest risk scores of limãos sub basin 3 2 groundwater flow and contaminant transport modeling before running the simulations the aggregated area of limãos assureira and amedo sub basins was defined as unconfined aquifer and replaced by a single grid consisting of 40 59 cells with a separation of 200 m cell size between central nodes in reality this region covers a 10 4 9 6 m rectangle with a total area of 99 84 km2 the spatially distributed values of h and b are provided as supplementary material on average they are h 0 8 m and b 186 m the estimation of r k and n e was based on monthly discharges compiled from the records of 23 spring catchments located in or in the vicinity of limãos assureira and amedo sub basins the mean values of these parameters are r 1 64 10 4 m day 1 k 2 10 3 m day 1 and n e 1 2 10 4 the geometric features of these catchments are on average a 29 km2 v 18 km3 l 6 km following the allocation of h and b as well as the mean k and n e data to the corresponding grid layers the processing modflow simulations ran for 1 month and for 1 2 5 10 20 and 40 years always expressed as days in steady state mode the modeling of flow and transport could have been run in the transient mode to account for eventual changes in recharge over time it is worth mentioning however that the recharge values used in the modeling were derived from baseflow discharges of springs using the hydrograph method see table 1 which are rather insensitive to short term fluctuations in recharge on the other hand stream flow records of azibo river in the past 35 years source portuguese water institute https snirh apambiente pt to which the modeled sub basins drain do not expose a trend of downward or upward stream flows that would suggest a steady long term reduction or increase in recharge therefore the simulations that were run in steady state mode are assumed to be adequate representations of long term conditions nitrate concentrations were compiled from the chemical analyses of 23 springs distributed around the limãos assureira and amedo sub basins the spring water samples were collected in the winter january 1998 spring april 1997 and summer september 1997 seasons the spatial distributions of the measured concentrations are illustrated in fig 6 a c respectively the figures include the hatched polygons to represent regions with large specific vulnerability rating l 9 classified as high risk areas regardless of the season the highest nitrate contours are displaced towards the catchment outlet from the high risk areas in the limãos and assureira sub basins in the amedo sub basin the highest nitrate contours overlap the high risk areas totally or partially but they also extend downhill where no risk areas were identified it is therefore clear that application of spot matching to validate the modeled results of groundwater contamination risk is inappropriate in this mountainous region as anticipated the modeled nitrate concentrations are illustrated in figs 7a b along with the high risk areas previously depicted in fig 6 in processing modflow these regions were defined as sources of concentrated nitrate leachates derived from dissolution of farmland fertilizers the sites where nitrate was periodically infiltrated into the soil and propagated towards groundwater are plotted in fig 7a i these locations were uniformly distributed inside the risk areas while the number of infiltration points was defined proportionally to the risk area dimension at infiltration the concentration was set to 20 mg l 1 based on the maximum nitrate concentration in the springs after discarding some anomalous values the modflow mt3d routines were run twice because a thorough analysis of hydraulic conductivity data revealed for the 23 springs two characteristic values fig 8 a constant k 31 2 10 4 m day 1 for smaller catchment volumes an average k 6 0 10 4 m day 1 for larger catchment volumes it is well documented that hydraulic conductivity decreases with depth manning and ingebritsen 1999 saar and manga 2004 wang et al 2009 because fractures tend to reduce their aperture with depth larger basins in the same geological and geomorphological contexts are usually deeper basins the reason why they can generally show lower average hydraulic conductivities thus two hypothetical groundwater flow scenarios were presented considering the observed k values the first scenario assumed that flow and transport occurs mostly at shallower depths involving smaller watershed volumes and hence controlled by larger hydraulic conductivities for this scenario the value of k used in the modflow simulation was k 31 2 10 4 m day 1 the average k of black dots in fig 8 the corresponding simulation results are portrayed in fig 7a the second scenario assumed that flow and transport goes deeper and hence involves larger watershed volumes characterized by smaller hydraulic conductivities in this case the adopted k 6 0 10 4 m day 1 the average k of red dots in fig 8 produced the results depicted in fig 7b comparison of modeled and observed concentrations favors the first scenario for example in fig 7b second scenario the modeled nitrate concentrations in the assureira sub basin are always very high except for the 1 month stress period while the measured concentration revealed a nitrate trend with concentrations increasing downstream this discrepancy does not occur in fig 7a first scenario the nitrate concentration profiles along the longest flow paths of assureira and amedo sub basins are displayed in fig 9 a b respectively the flow paths are identified in fig 7a by the blue lines for the assureira sub basin a substantial agreement exists between measured and modeled profiles namely between the winter profile and the 1 year stress period profile and between the spring summer profiles and the 20 year stress period profile in both cases the fittings of modeled to measured concentrations are above r 2 0 8 these results are remarkable because they strongly suggest the transport of pollutants along local in winter and intermediate regional circuits in this sub basin besides they contribute significantly to confirming concentration profiling as a method to validate contamination risk in mountainous catchments it is worth to mention at this point that travel times of groundwater in the 23 spring catchments approach 45 29 years see supplementary material this is additional support for the modeled stress periods and helps justify the relationship between summer and 20 year concentration profiles the results for the amedo sub basin are less impressive but still reliable in this case the summer nitrate profile fitted well to the 10 year stress period profile finally if the cross profiles of sub basins assureira and amedo are compared with the theoretical profiles fig 2 it is clear the association of assureira sub basin to the b type watershed and the amedo to the type a watershed 4 discussion the analytical results for the three sub basins showed that spring water discharged in the winter season january 1998 was affected by raised nitrate concentrations 15 25 mg l 1 around the catchment outlet while being uncontaminated elsewhere the cross profiling of analytical and modeled modflow mt3d results for the assureira sub basin further revealed that winter nitrate patterns can be explained by 1 year underground flow confirming that winter spring water probably represents return flow of water previously accumulated in the saprolite layer interflow the results for winter patterns are not challenging for planners of groundwater protection because the time span of expected contaminant flushing is relatively short not much longer than one year once the contaminant source is neutralized when the focus moves to spring april 1997 and summer september 1997 flow the perception of the results changes considerably in both seasons the results of cross profiling linked nitrate patterns to decadal groundwater travel times which means that spring and summer water is certainly baseflow decadal travel times of shallow groundwater are not surprising and have been reported in numerous other studies bing et al 2017 hemmings et al 2015 the results of modflow mt3d further showed that baseflow discharge is contaminated across the entire basin when risky areas are located around the headwaters amedo sub basin a type a watershed and clean otherwise assureira sub basin a type b watershed thus the modeling exercise provides evidence that safeguarding the catchment headwater is the keystone of groundwater quality protection in mountainous catchments this is a landmark of our study and corroborates legal constraints already imposed on catchment headwaters specifically for the study region the national ecologic reserve of portugal nerp safeguards the so called strategic areas for protection and recharge of aquifers through the decree law n 239 2012 the law is clear about criteria to use when defining and delineating these groundwater resource sensitive areas explicitly declaring the need to consider aquifer recharge and discharge mechanisms directions of underground flow and any hydraulic connections vulnerability to pollution and pressures resulting from activities and or facilities and main uses in particular the production of water for human consumption the nerp decree law guidelines were transposed to municipal regulations namely in macedo de cavaleiros where the studied sub basins are located notice no 11026 2015 in this case the municipal management plan has classified various headwaters as strategic for protection of aquifers but not the ones heading the limãos assureira and amedo catchments no mitigation action has therefore been taken and this is probably the reason why the quality of amedo sub basin groundwater stays relatively deteriorated in general this is the missing link between policy and groundwater quality besides the safeguard of groundwater resources the protection of headwaters is supported by many environmental associations for their critical role in stream ecosystems namely because headwaters support a biodiversity of communities including species of aquatic insects that are primarily restricted to spring seeps and first order channels kaplan et al 2008 moreover in some european union eu countries headwater catchments are being used as references in new generation of river basin management plans because they are viewed as most suited to fulfill the ecological quality objectives required by the eu water framework directive baattrup pedersen et al 2018 the economic value of ecosystem services across headwater catchments is also a motivation for their protection in the united states a recent survey revealed that it represents int 14 000 ha 1 yr 1 hill et al 2014 protection of catchment headwaters in the studied area is crucial because travel times of groundwater are large despite the small scale of limãos assureira and amedo watersheds when spring and summer nitrate patterns are compared with modeled plumes the results are alarming because cross profiles matched for travel times of 20 years in the assureira and 10 years in the amedo sub basins the match to long periods is preoccupying because it presumably implies similar periods to accomplish complete aquifer cleansing similar concerns relative to long term groundwater contamination and cleansing were shared by hagedorn et al 2018 who studied the california s south coast range where nitrogen fertilizer applications have steadily increased since the 1950s the persistent fertilizing coupled with decadal soil percolation and recharge transit times rendered the nitrate impact on groundwater resources a condition of legacy for years and even decades to come although not related to nitrogen other recent studies on groundwater contamination alerted to the inheritance of past activity impacts jamin et al 2012 a positive feedback from the natural system may be the attenuation of no3 n in groundwater through denitrification reactions e g collins et al 2017 our mt3d results did not consider the impact of any reaction on the nitrate concentrations however even if these reactions are active in the study area their effect on baseflow is not enough to bring concentrations down to acceptable levels especially in the amedo sub basin once the nitrate concentrations are high at the outlet area of a catchment e g the amedo sub basin it is not likely that denitrification reactions were very active at the source areas otherwise the concentrations at the outlet areas would have to be low as denitrification ultimately reduces nitrate to nitrogen along the underground path that can be long and last for several years nitrate concentrations in the studied area fulfill the nitrates directive 2006 118 ec threshold considered to be acceptable for drinking water which is 50 mg l 1 it is worth recalling however that concentrations 3 mg l 1 generally indicate contamination madison and brunett 1985 while a recent study found that concentrations over 1 mg l 1 nitrate indicate human activity dubrovsky et al 2010 it is also worth mentioning that the us environmental protection agency epa maximum contaminant level for nitrate set to protect against blue baby syndrome is 10 mg l 1 https www epa gov nutrient policy data it is therefore urgent to set off other initiatives to protect groundwater from contamination besides conformity with the nitrates directive or the restriction of land uses at catchment headwaters already imposed by the decree law n 239 2012 among other initiatives economic valuation studies of groundwater are crucial to estimate the public benefits from improved groundwater quality and to assess public perception and willingness to pay for groundwater protection the first study carried out in central portugal revealed that the willingness to pay is considerable varying between 20 and 30 over and above the current water bill the local residents pay for safe drinking water quality and natural background levels respectively brouwer et al 2018 the dissemination of valuation study results to groundwater users and decision makers through official channels and the media is probably one missing step required to translate scientific results and mitigation proposals into clean groundwater it is therefore time to fill in this gap 5 conclusions the fractured aquifer in the limãos assureira and amedo stream catchments 0 31 km2 in total which are small sub catchments of azibo river basin northern portugal were considered at moderate risk of being contaminated with nitrate sourced from agricultural activities namely through leaching of fertilizers from crop or produced pasture land the threat was confirmed by moderate nitrate concentrations 15 25 mg l 1 assessed from spring water in winter spring and summer seasons these concentrations fulfill the nitrates directive 2006 118 ec threshold for drinking water 50 mg l 1 but exceed us epa limits to protect against blue baby syndrome 10 mg l 1 using the processing modflow graphical user interface the measured nitrate concentrations could be modeled as nitrate plumes the simulations were based on prior hydraulic characterization namely for the sub catchments hydraulic conductivities and effective porosities using the well known brutsaert method a thorough analysis of hydraulic conductivity values suggested that flow and solute transport occur mostly at shallow depths within the fractured aquifer hydraulic heads were measured across the three sub catchments and on average are 0 8 m the modeled plumes are 1 year old when calibrated by nitrate concentrations observed in the winter season and 10 to 20 years old when compared with measured spring and summer concentrations besides linking risky areas contaminant sources to nitrate plumes contaminant sinks exposing the virtues of a new groundwater contamination risk algorithm the contaminant transport modeling alerted for the long time span required to free baseflow discharges from anthropogenic nitrate the alert is even more pertinent because the announced united nations sustainable development goals related to water and sanitation goal 6 are to be fulfilled in a short time span 2030 unless water planners and policy makers decide to implement active measures involving neutralization of contaminant sources immediately it will be very difficult to comply with the goals in the predefined deadline acknowledgments this research was sponsored by the interact project integrated research in environment agro chain and technology no norte

6936,socioeconomic drought in association with minimum instream flow against the backdrop of local water supply was investigated an integrated procedure for design combinations of drought properties such as duration severity and peak involving the truncation of drought events the goodness of fit of joint and marginal distributions of drought properties the determination of design combinations of these properties for a given kendall return period and the evaluation of uncertainty of the combinations was developed in multivariate design of socioeconomic droughts in a case study univariate bivariate and trivariate design values of drought properties and their alterations due to the regulation of water reservoirs were computed results showed that any two properties of drought exhibited a high positive dependence for a given bivariate return period the pairs of cumulative frequencies of drought properties formed a symmetric curve for truncated samples and a symmetric curving belt for large quantities of simulated samples for a given trivariate return period the pairs of cumulative frequencies of duration and peak showed a symmetry but the pairs of duration and severity or severity and peak were remarkably scattered on the side of severity and comparatively concentrated on the side of duration or peak for the confidence interval of probability of 0 95 the range of trivariate design values was larger than that of bivariate design the differences between drought design values of univariate bivariate and trivariate designs were small which resulted from high correlations of drought properties the use of kendall frequency and approximate identical cumulative frequencies in design combinations the decrease of socioeconomic drought properties under the regulation of water reservoirs was significant but the drought spell total volume and monthly maximum of water deficit for a 5 year return period still accounted for 3 06 3 27 months 0 426 0 470 billion m3 and 0 211 0 217 billion m3 respectively provided that the local water supply was met keywords socioeconomic drought multivariate design copula function most likely weight function uncertainty water reservoirs 1 introduction the national drought mitigation center of usa considers drought as a creeping insidious natural hazard which originates from precipitation deficiency over an extended period of time and generally refers to water shortage which results in losses to agriculture and livestock socioeconomic disruption ecological environmental imbalance and even endangerment of human life impacts of drought result from the interplay between natural events and water demands of regional socio economy and can be exacerbated by human activities therefore drought cannot be treated exclusively as a physical phenomenon its definitions vary from field to field and its impacts vary from region to region dracup et al 1980 wilhite and glantz 1985 divided droughts into four categories meteorological agricultural hydrological or socioeconomic the first three types of droughts are viewed as a physical phenomenon and socioeconomic drought is associated with local water supply which tracks water demand through socioeconomic systems human impacts on the terrestrial hydrosphere are now so widespread that it is difficult to find a watershed that does not reflect the interaction among human activities and natural hydrologic processes wada et al 2013 vörösmarty et al 2010 van loon and van lanen 2013 vogel et al 2015 the newly emerging discipline of socio hydrology entailing links and feedbacks between water resources and society is receiving much attention these days wada et al 2011 sivapalan et al 2012 madani 2014 montanari 2015 sivapalan 2015 loucks 2015 troy et al 2015 wheater and gober 2015 as population industries and urbanization grow the water demand increases and socioeconomic drought becomes a major concern mehran et al 2015 socioeconomic drought thereby refers to the condition that water supply cannot satisfy demand leading to societal and economic disruptions and environmental impacts garen 1993 arab et al 2010 lapp 2012 sivapalan et al 2012 hill et al 2014 mehran et al 2015 wheater and gober 2015 socioeconomic drought as a seasonal deficit of precipitation combined with the increase of regional water demand due to climate change and regional development leading to increasing stress on water supply calls for further studies for measuring socioeconomic drought statistical indices e g reliability resilience and vulnerability first introduced by hashimoto et al 1982 have been developed moy et al 1986 jinno 1995 vogel and bolognese 1995 srinivasan et al 1999 vogel et al 1999 ward et al 2013 steinschneider and brown 2012 however these indices differ in their computational methodologies jain and bhunya 2008 mehran et al 2015 integrating resilience and vulnerability for multi reservoir systems is not easy miller et al 2010 in addition these indices cannot exhibit the frequency distribution of any of the important drought properties e g duration severity of water deficit etc which are generally concerned with water resources planning and management water supply usually entails withdrawals from rivers an appropriate flow in a certain section of river is maintained to preserve its ecological environment on one hand and guarantee the safety of various withdrawals for meeting water demands of socioeconomic systems on the other hand from another perspective the expected flow in association with water demand determines the occurrence and frequency of socioeconomic drought the socioeconomic drought properties including duration severity and peak can be analyzed on the basis of run method widely applied in hydrological drought analysis zelenhasic and salvai 1987 tallaksen et al 1997 tu et al 2016 zhang et al 2013 2015 by truncating a series of events less than the expected streamflow in practice frequency analysis of socioeconomic drought properties is similar to that of hydrological drought the difference is that the truncation level of hydrological drought is a flow of a certain percentile less than the average value of streamflow for example from q50 to q95 and that of the socioeconomic drought is closely associated with the requirement of instream flow for satisfying withdrawals of regional socioeconomic systems apparently drought properties of the truncated events are not only individual random processes but also have dependences between them that is a sequence of events is viewed as a multivariate random process in association with multivariate dependences copula functions which can model random variables and their dependences and their multivariate joint distributions have been widely applied in multivariate drought studies favre et al 2004 salvadori and de michele 2004 2007 shiau 2006 shiau et al 2007 dupuis 2007 modarres 2007 kao and rao 2010 song and singh 2010 mishra and singh 2010 2011 de michele et al 2013 chen et al 2013 2015 tu et al 2016 in the analysis of joint return period the kendall frequency was applied to improve the calculation of joint probability salvadori et al 2011 2013 chen et al 2013 jiang et al 2015 as shown by volpi and fiori 2014 for flood events occurring in a reservoir catchment the kendall frequency is not necessarily the safety standard for evaluating the joint distribution of multiple variables indeed it is a transfer of probability by defining a multivariate joint frequency as a random variable the transferred probability exceeding the percentile is larger than the original probability that is using the transfer becomes safer for design droughts from another point of view design values of multivariate return periods using the kendall frequency are equally comparable to those of individual univariate return periods in recent years multivariate design has received significant attention salvadori et al 2011 2013 volpi and fiori 2012 2014 vandenberghe et al 2012 serinaldi 2013 serinaldi and kilsby 2015 as a joint distribution of drought properties is determined by truncated samples how to determine a combination of drought properties for a given joint return period is perceived as a design realization of drought properties there is a one to one correspondence between return period and design value for an individual design property but a given joint return period actually leads to many combinations of drought properties and these combinations are generally not equivalent in practice however for drought management and mitigation of water deficit one may be expected to determine just one combination a most likely weight function with respect to a product of joint and marginal probability densities was proposed to exclusively determine one design combination of a given joint return period salvadori et al 2011 then using the confidence interval ci that includes critical events with a significant probability level the uncertainty of a design combination can be evaluated volpi and fiori 2012 2014 vandenberghe et al 2012 in addition reservoirs play a key role in managing water supply and reducing the impact of socioeconomic droughts nalbantis and koutsoyiannis 1997 nalbantis and tsakiris 2009 van loon and van lanen 2013 mehran et al 2015 at the end of the last century approximately 20 of the total global annual river discharge was controlled by man made reservoirs and 70 of global freshwater withdrawals came from these reservoirs fekete et al 1999 shiklomanov et al 2000 vörösmarty and sahagian 2000 indicating the importance of reservoirs in providing resilience for human water use globally zhang et al 2014b mehran et al 2015 the dongjiang river of south china is the main source for water supply of several booming megalopolises in the pearl river delta e g hongkong guangzhou shenzhen and dongguan due to its south subtropical humid climate zone the dongjiang river basin is rich in water resources resulting from average annual precipitation of 1770 mm with the rapid development of local socio economy the imbalance of water supply and demand has been increasing in the 21st century in addition streamflow processes in the dongjiang river have been significantly altered by human activities in particular the regulation of water reservoirs tu et al 2012 2015 zhang et al 2014a in the dongjiang river basin several studies have paid significant attention to hydrological droughts in association with a certain percentile of streamflow below the mean value chen et al 2013 zhang et al 2013 tu et al 2016 however socioeconomic droughts involving water demand of local socioeconomic systems become more important for local water resources management therefore in the dongjiang river basin as a case study multivariate design of socioeconomic drought in association with a minimum instream flow of water management was investigated in this paper drought events were truncated for monthly streamflows by using the run method the multivariate distribution of drought properties was determined by using the copula function the joint probability of drought properties exceeding the percentile was transferred by using the kendall frequency an integrated procedure of multivariate design of socioeconomic drought involving the evaluation of uncertainty on the basis of the most likely weight was proposed then univariate bivariate and trivariate design values of individual drought properties were compared and the impacts of water reservoirs on socioeconomic drought were evaluated 2 methodology 2 1 socioeconomic drought events a series of drought events using the run method can be truncated with a predefined threshold value of streamflow the selection of a truncation level depends on the type of drought to be studied dracup et al 1980 for hydrological drought a certain percentile of streamflow below the mean or median value can be set as the truncation level zelenhasic and salvai 1987 clausen and pearson 1995 tallaksen et al 1997 tu et al 2016 for socioeconomic drought the truncation level was set by minimum instream flow q m in order to satisfy the regional water supply or considering social economic development water environmental protection etc mathier et al 1992 madsen and rosbjerg 1995 tu et al 2017 as shown in fig 1 a drought event was characterized by duration d severity s peak p which respectively refer to drought spell total volume of water deficit during drought and maximum deficit for a certain time scale e g monthly between two adjacent drought events with longer duration and higher severity streamflow with shorter duration and smaller magnitude but beyond the threshold occur the two adjacent drought events were regarded to be subject to a drought which was split by the shorter streamflow exceeding the threshold therefore in consideration of inter event time and volume a criterion for pooling mutually dependent droughts was introduced by zelenhasic and salvai 1987 subsequently it was revised by madsen and rosbjerg 1995 and has been used zhang et al 2013 tu et al 2016 let d i s i p i and d i 1 s i 1 p i 1 be two adjacent droughts with a spell t i and excess volume of spell v i if the spell was less than a predefined critical duration t c and the ratio ρ i between the volume and that of the preceding deficit volume s i was less than a predefined critical value ρ c then d i s i p i and d i 1 s i 1 p i 1 were pooled into a new drought calculated as 1 d pool d i d i 1 t i s pool s i s i 1 v i p pool max p i p i 1 where d pool s pool and p pool refer to the duration severity and peak after the two adjacent drought events were pooled respectively see a dash cycle in the left part of fig 1 the pooling was ceaselessly repeated for the already pooled droughts by using eq 1 if both t i and ρ i were less than t c and ρ c see a dash oval in the right part of fig 1 using a monthly time scale a six month inter event time tc can be generally fixed as the critical duration due to half and half of wet and dry seasons within a year in this case study the critical ratio of excess volume of inter event time and the preceding deficit volume ρc can be set as 0 3 madsen and rosbjerg 1995 zhang et al 2013 2015 in practice the critical ratio ρc generally plays a key role in pooling together drought events 2 2 marginal and joint distributions of drought properties assume that x which refers to any one of duration d severity s peak p of drought is a continuous random variable f x which refers to its cumulative distribution function can be formulated as 2 f x p x x u where u also refers to a cumulative distribution frequency cdf non exceedance probability of duration severity or peak several conventional univariate distributions i e two parameter lognormal distribution logn and weibull distribution wbl and three parameter generalized extreme value distribution gev generalized logistic distribution glo and generalized normal distribution gno were fitted to the marginal distributions of drought properties then using the sklar theorem nelsen 2006 an m dimensional joint distribution function of drought properties h x 1 x m can be defined as 3 h x 1 x m c f x 1 f x m c u 1 u m where c u 1 u m is the m dimensional copula function which is the joint distribution function of standard uniform random variables within the range of 0 1 and u i f x i i 1 m refer to individual cdfs of drought properties and m 2 or m 3 for any two variables or three variables of drought properties respectively owing to its flexibility accessibility and simple parameters in association with a correlation coefficient matrix an m dimensional meta gaussian copula was selected for modeling the joint distribution of drought properties its theoretical cumulative distribution function c u 1 u m and density function c u 1 u m were deduced as follows genest and favre 2007 4 c u 1 u m b 1 b m g ω 1 ω d d ω 1 d ω m 5 c u 1 u m 1 2 exp ζ t σ 1 ζ 2 ζ t ζ 2 where 6 g ω 1 ω m 2 π m 2 σ 1 2 exp ω t σ 1 ω 2 where b 1 φ 1 u 1 b m φ 1 u m in which φ 1 refers to the inverse function of the standard normal distribution and ω ω 1 ω m t and ζ b 1 b m t are the matrices of variables in the integrand the correlation coefficient matrix σ was expressed as 7 σ 1 ρ 1 j ρ 1 m ρ i 1 ρ ij ρ im ρ m 1 ρ mj 1 ρ ij 1 i j ρ ji i j where ρ ij 1 1 refers to the correlation coefficient between any two drought properties for the goodness of fit of marginal and joint distributions of drought properties the anderson darling s a d test method panchenko 2005 dobric and schmid 2007 genest and favre 2007 song and singh 2010 ma et al 2013 tu et al 2016 was used for the marginal distribution of drought properties let x be any one of drought properties with a length of n then the a d statistic a n 2 was computed as 8 a n 2 n 1 n i 1 n 2 i 1 ln f x i ln 1 f x n i 1 where f x i is the cdf derived from the tested distribution for the joint distribution of drought properties with an m dimension a n 2 was formulated as 9 a n 2 n 1 n i 1 n 2 i 1 ln f s i ln 1 f s n i 1 where s i i 1 n refers to the pseudo observations of drought properties from a χ 2 2 distribution random variable for the bivariate or trivariate joint distribution of drought properties s was respectively calculated as 10 s φ 1 u 1 2 φ 1 c u 2 u 1 2 or 11 s φ 1 c u 1 u 2 2 φ 1 c u 3 c u 1 u 2 2 the bootstrap procedure for the goodness of fit test statistics of multi variate joint distribution a n 2 was employed dobric and schmid 2007 genest et al 2009 song and singh 2010 ma et al 2013 the critical value at the significance level α 0 05 for the goodness of fit test of theoretical individual and joint distributions of drought properties was obtained by the monte carlo method with 5000 simulations or more if a p value of the test statistic computed from the samples was more than the significance level the corresponding theoretical distribution was accepted for univariate distributions of drought properties root mean square error rmse and akaike information criterion aic were used to select the optimal distribution provided that several univariate theoretical distributions were accepted in addition empirical and theoretical distributions were compared for assessing the selected marginal and joint distributions of drought properties the empirical distribution function was defined as dobric and schmid 2007 genest et al 2009 tu et al 2016 12 f x 1 x m i 1 n i x 1 i x 1 x m i x m n where function i is an indicator function which is equal to one when the enclosed expression is true but is zero otherwise in hydrological practice the empirical probability was usually transformed as gringorten 1963 13 f e f x 1 x m 0 44 n 0 12 where m 1 m 2 or m 3 for any one variable any two variables or three variables of drought properties respectively 2 3 return periods of drought properties the selection of probabilities of a random variable below or exceeding the given percentiles depends on different hydrological questions for example the probabilities exceeding the percentiles are of main concern for drought properties for the multivariate combination various types in association with the operators and or and conditional can be used salvadori and de michele 2004 however in the statistical analysis of drought properties the individual probabilities of a combination of random variables simultaneously exceeding the percentiles were of main concern therefore for u i 1 u i i 1 2 3 referring to individual probabilities exceeding the percentiles of three properties of drought let c u 1 u 2 be the pair of bivariate exceedance probabilities of any two drought properties defined as 14 c u 1 u 2 1 i 1 2 u i c u 1 u 2 then let c u 1 u 2 u 3 be the trivariate exceedance probabilities of drought properties defined as 15 c u 1 u 2 u 3 1 i 1 3 u i i 1 2 j i 1 3 c u i u j c u 1 u 2 u 3 further a kendall function which is a univariate representation of multivariate information genest and rivest 1993 barbe et al 1996 salvadori et al 2011 2013 has been shown to be a good tool for calculating a copula based joint frequency of multivariate events nappo and spizzichino 2009 salvadori et al 2011 and has been applied in computing the joint return period of hydrological multivariables salvadori et al 2013 the kendall frequency was estimated as 16 k c q p c u 1 u m q 1 n i 1 n i c i q where q 0 1 is a probability level and n refers to the length of observed or simulated samples the method of solution refers to algorithms 1 and 2 presented by salvadori et al 2011 based on the above discussion t 1 of the univariate return period of drought properties was calculated by individual marginal probabilities exceeding the defined percentile as follows 17 t 1 e l u 1 where u 1 refers to the exceedance probability of any one of drought properties then using the kendall frequencies the bivariate and trivariate joint return periods of drought properties t 2 and t 3 were respectively calculated as 18 t 2 e l k c u 1 u 2 19 t 3 e l k c u 1 u 2 u 3 where k c u 1 u 2 and k c u 1 u 2 u 3 refers to the kendal frequency of joint distribution of any two variables and three variables of drought properties respectively and e l is the average inter arrival time of drought events the inter arrival time was defined as the time between consecutive arrivals if n denoted the length of years of sample data and n the lenght of drought events then e l was defined as 20 e l n n 2 4 design drought properties in design practice using the truncated drought samples the unvariate bivariate and trivariate distributions can be determined on the basis of the previously mentioned theoretical distributions for a given return period the monte carlo method was used to simulate new individual cdfs and combinations of cdfs of drought properties as is known a given return period corresponds to a cdf of individual drought properties for the univariate design but is associated with numerous combinations of cdfs for the bivariate or trivariate design therefore a design realization in association with the most likely weight function was proposed by salvadori et al 2011 the joint design of drought properties was derived as follows 21 u 1 u m arg max f x 1 x m 22 f x 1 x m c u 1 u m i 1 m f x i where u 1 u m is eventually selected as the design combination of cdfs of drought properties for a given joint return period with m 2 for any two properties of droughts and with m 3 for three properties of droughts and f x 1 x m refers to a product of joint probability density c u 1 u m and their individual marginal probability densities f x i i 1 m 2 5 uncertainty of multivariate design of drought properties in the bivariate design case a symmetrical curve of the vertex was formed by countless combinations for a given joint return period these bivariate combinations along the curve may not be equivalent from a practical design view point moreover the distance of each combination along the curve from its vertex can be denoted the limits of subset extending from two sides of the vertex were measured by evaluating the joint probability density in association with the confidence interval ci of a probability 1 α volpi and fiori 2012 in this case marginal frequencies of two variables on the vertex of the curve were regarded as identical however in the design realization the combination with the maximum of products of joint and marginal probability densities should be the core point from the curve for a given return period the core point may be off the vertex due to different individual marginal distributions for the multivariate design therefore the difference s k k 1 l which for any one combination was far from the core point was defined as 23 s k u 1 k u 1 2 u m k u m 2 where u 1 k u m k k 1 2 l and u 1 u m denote those selected combinations and the maximum of the products in the bivariate m 2 or trivariate m 3 design respectively then the uncertain range that included those combinations with the confidence interval of probability 1 α were limited based on order statistics of the difference s k k 1 l serinaldi 2013 2 6 procedure of multivariate design of drought properties for calculating design combinations of marginal cdfs of drought properties for a given joint return period no general analytical formulation can be derived for the gaussian copula in addition the simulated and design combinations for any given kendall return period were determined by the distribution parameters estimated using the truncated samples in design practice the monte carlo method was used for repeatedly simulating new combinations of drought properties with the identical length of the truncated samples the new estimated copula parameters resulted in the changes of simulated and design combinations that is the uncertainty of the estimated copula parameter needed to be considered therefore when the gaussian copula and the kendall return period were synthetically applied for the assessment of uncertainty an integrated procedure for the design combination of drought properties in the face of regional water supply was proposed as follows 1 truncating socioeconomic drought events from a streamflow process using the run method drought events including duration severity and peak were truncated with a predefined threshold value which refers to the minimum instream flow for satisfying the withdrawal for local socioeconomic systems the pooling of drought events was then considered 2 fitting joint and marginal distributions of drought properties for the truncated samples of drought properties the joint and marginal distributions and their parameters were determined by the goodness of fit of the recommended m dimensional meta gaussian copula and conventional univariate distributions 3 calculating the exceedance cdfs corresponding to a given kendall return period t k on the one hand the kendall cdf k c for the given kendall return period can be inversely calculated using eqs 18 and 19 on the other hand using the determined copula parameters fitting the samples large quantities of combinations of marginal cdfs of drought properties u 1 i u m i i 1 n 1 with the length of simulations n 1 were randomly generated by the monte carlo method their exceedance joint cdfs c i i 1 n 1 and kendall cdfs k c i i 1 n 1 were subsequently calculated using eqs 14 16 among them the exceedance joint cdf c i for which its corresponding kendall cdf k c i was closest to k c was selected as c t 4 acquiring combinations of marginal cdfs for the selected exceedance joint cdf u 1 j u m j j 1 n 2 with the length of simulations n 2 were newly generated by the monte carlo method and c j j 1 n 2 were also calculated for the selected exceedance joint cdf c t the allowable relative error re was defined as 24 c j c t c t re then in the simulated combinations u 1 j u m j j 1 n 2 those for which their exceedance cdfs satisfied equation 24 were selected that is the selected combinations u 1 k u m k k 1 l with the length of l which satisfied c k c t were found x 1 k x m k j 1 l corresponding to u 1 k u m k k 1 l can be inversely calculated 5 determining the design combination of marginal cdfs of drought properties from eqs 21 and 22 for all selected combinations the products of probability densities f x 1 k x m k k 1 l on the basis of joint probability densities c u 1 k u m k k 1 l and individual marginal probability densities f x 1 k f x m k k 1 2 l were calculated and u 1 u m with the maximum of the product from u 1 k u m k k 1 2 l was found as the design combination for the given kendall return period of drought properties t k 6 calculating design values for the determined combination of marginal cdfs of drought properties design values of each drought property were inversely calculated based on their individual marginal distributions 7 assessing the uncertainty for design combinations of drought properties new samples of drought properties with the identical length of truncated drought samples with n 3 times by using the monte carlo method were simulated and their copula parameters were estimated then when the procedure from 3 to 6 was repeatedly executed for each new combination of samples the design combinations u 1 k u m k k 1 n 3 with the length of n 3 were acquired from eq 24 design combinations that included the confidence interval with probability 1 α were limited based on order statistics serinaldi 2013 among them u 1 u m the maximum product of joint probability densities was eventually selected as the design combination from simulated samples 2 7 impact of water reservoirs as water reservoirs of a basin are constructed and operated observed streamflow substantially differs from its pristine version a usual method is that streamflow in the period influenced by reservoirs should be entirely returned van loon and van lanen 2013 let q o be the observed streamflow then the naturalized streamflow q n was defined as 25 q n q o δ q q o q in q out where δ q is the alteration of streamflow due to the operation of reservoirs and q in and q out refer to the inflow and outflow of reservoirs respectively 3 case study and data the dongjiang river basin is located in south china with clear wet and dry seasons shown in fig 2 three major reservoirs namely xinfengjiang fengshuba and baipenzhu with storages of 6 49 1 25 and 0 39 billion m3 have been in operation since 1961 1974 and 1986 respectively monthly streamflow data from the boluo station as the control station of the basin with a catchment area of 25 325 km2 were used they covered a common period of 56 hydrological years from april 1954 to march 2010 since the 1960 s surface water resources in the dongjiang river basin have been well developed tu et al 2012 streamflow in the main stream of the basin has been apparently influenced by the regulation of the above reservoirs tu et al 2012 2015 2017 on the basis of differences between inflow and outflow of individual reservoirs in terms of monthly time scale the observed series of streamflow at the boluo station can be returned to the naturalized series then with the rapid increase of water withdrawals of local socioeconomic systems the imbalance between water supply and demand has been growing increasingly in the 21st century in order to alleviate the imbalance in particular to secure water supply for the important cities of pearl river delta such as hong kong guangzhou and shenzhen the minimum instream flow of the boluo station has been implemented in recent years according to the water resources allocation scheme of the dongjiang river basin in guangdong province 2011 the minimum instream flow at the boluo station q m was set at 320 m3 s 1 approximately a percentile of 13 1 or 36 2 of the observed or naturalized monthly streamflow respectively therefore in terms of monthly streamflow both the naturalized series from april of 1954 to march of 2010 and the observed series from april of 1961 to march of 2010 were used in truncating socioeconomic drought events by comparing to the differences between univariate bivariate and trivariate design values of individual drought properties on the basis of two series impacts of water reservoirs on socioeconomic droughts were determined 4 results and discussion 4 1 drought properties from samples observed and naturalized series are illustrated in fig 3 the monthly observed and naturalized flows in terms of the average value with a small difference accounted for 741 and 758 m3 s 1 respectively however under the regulation of water reservoirs since 1961 low streamflows have significantly increased but drought events have remarkably decreased socioeconomic droughts of naturalized streamflows occurred 56 times during the period from 1954 to 2009 with a duration of 1 02 years and those of observed streamflows decreased to 28 times during the period from 1961 to 2009 with a duration of 0 58 year as shown in table 1 for naturalized flows the maximum drought lasted 17 months with the severity of 5 77 billion m3 and the peak of 0 68 billion m3 the average duration severity and peak accounted for 4 25 months 1 3 and 0 415 billion m3 respectively the severity of the minimum drought with a duration of a month accounted for 46 million m3 for observed flows the duration severity and peak of the maximum drought decreased to 6 months 1 78 and 0 51 billion m3 respectively the average duration severity and peak accounted for 2 48 months 0 375 and 0 176 billion m3 respectively the severity of the minimum drought with a month accounted for 3 million m3 due to the regulation of water reservoirs the duration severity and peak of the maximum drought decreased by 64 7 69 1 and 25 5 respectively the average duration severity and peak decreased by 41 6 71 1 and 57 6 respectively the severity of the minimum drought decreased by 93 3 in addition compared to the average values the median values of duration and severity for the naturalized series slightly decreased but the decreases for the observed series were large it implied that there were more events with shorter duration and lower severity under the regulation of water reservoirs 4 2 individual and joint distributions of drought properties the general statistical boxes of socioeconomic drought properties of observed and naturalized series are shown in fig 4 except that the maxima of duration and severity of the naturalized series were far from the extended boundary and the top three durations of the observed series were out of the extended boundary most samples of drought properties fell in the range of extended boundaries which were generally viewed as normal the goodness of fit test results of univariate distributions are shown in table 2 for the severity and peak of two series the p values of five univariate distributions were greater than the significant level of 0 05 except for the logn distribution of the peak of the naturalized series for the duration the p values of logn wbl and gno distributions for the observed series and only that of the wbl distribution for the naturalized were greater than the significant level these showed that the five univariate distributions almost fitted the severity and peak of drought but only the wbl distribution fitted all drought properties for the observed and naturalized series in addition comparing the rmse and aic values of the accepted distributions the optimal distribution of duration was wbl and that of the peak was gno for the two series the optimal distribution of severity was logn and gno for the observed and naturalized series respectively on the whole among the accepted distributions the rmse and aic values slightly differed and the p values of wbl for all properties of two series were the greatest as illustrated in fig 5 using the wbl distribution most points fell near the diagonal of 1 1 which implied small differences between the empirical and theoretical cdfs of individual drought properties therefore for convenience of comparison it was better to select wbl for modelling all marginal distributions of drought properties then between observed and naturalized series the wbl parameters of individual drought properties distinctly differed see table 3 as illustrated in fig 6 comparing the naturalized series the design curve of univariate return period of duration severity and peak of drought of the observed series remarkably moved down it denoted that univariate design values of drought properties decreased under the regulation of water reservoirs as shown in table 4 kendall τ spearman ρ and pearson γ of any two drought properties were greater than 0 5 implying that the dependences between them were high positive the differences of dependences between the two series in the combinations of duration and severity and duration and peak were small but were comparatively large in a combination of severity and peak as seen from fig 7 most points of the empirical and theoretical cdfs of the bivariate and trivariate distributions of drought properties fell closely to the diagonal of 1 1 except for those for the duration of observed series in the lower cdfs with a large drift which was attributed to more small droughts with a shorter duration for the observed series however the results of goodness of fit of joint distributions for drought properties showed that all p values were greater than the significant level of 0 05 see table 5 it demonstrated that using gaussian copula to fit the bivariate and trivariate distributions of drought properties was appropriate the estimated parameters of the gaussian copula on the samples of two series are shown in table 5 4 3 modelling and design of drought properties based on samples based on the selected marginal and joint distributions of the truncated samples of drought properties the equivalent scatter diagrams of the given bivariate kendall return periods exceeding the percentiles e g 5 years 10 years 20 years and 50 years are shown in fig 8 it is seen that the scatter points of a certain joint return period of any two variables of drought properties almost formed a symmetric curve of the diagonal of 1 1 then the differences of joint return period between observed and naturalized series were distinct compared to the naturalized series the curves of observed series shifted toward southwest it showed that the joint return period exceeding the percentile under the regulation of water reservoirs significantly increased for the identical bivariate pairs of drought properties in addition the design combinations of any two properties of drought were close to the 1 1 diagonal which implied that the marginal cdfs of any two properties were approximately identical in the bivariate design the given trivariate kendall return periods of the truncated samples of drought properties are shown in fig 9 in which subfigures are planar projections of the trivariate combinations the pairs of duration and peak in the combinations of duration severity and peak maintained a good symmetry around the 1 1 diagonal and formed an approximate curve with a tiny drift which decreased from the center to the two sides the pairs of duration and severity and severity and peak in the combinations of duration severity and peak maintained an approximate curve better on the side of duration or peak but were remarkably scattered on the side of severity the farther the distance to the 1 1 diagonal on the side of severity was the wider the drift of the pair of cdfs was the farther the distance to the 1 1 diagonal on the side of duration or peak was the more concentration on a curve of the pair of cdfs was these implied that the uncertainty of severity was larger than that of duration and peak for given trivariate joint return period of duration and severity and peak however the design combinations of any two properties of drought in the trivariate design were also close to the 1 1 diagonal 4 4 uncertainty of modeling and design of drought properties with 5000 simulations of new samples with the same length of truncated samples their bivariate and trivariate kendall return periods exceeding the percentiles are illustrated in figs 10 and 11 respectively for a given bivariate return period of any two variables of drought properties see fig 10 the simulated pairs of cdfs and those of the ci of a probability of 0 95 were symmetric about the 1 1 diagonal but they formed curving belts with a limited width in the direction of northeast southwest then the width in the ci along the two sides of the 1 1 diagonal differed for different pairs of the two drought properties the width of duration and peak was larger than that of duration and severity and that of the latter was larger than that of severity and peak for a given trivariate return period of drought properties see fig 11 the pairs of two drought properties formed a similar shape to that of truncated samples namely the pairs of duration and peak maintained a good symmetry about the 1 1 diagonal and formed a curving belt with a limited width of the direction of northeast southwest for duration and severity or severity and peak the range of the pairs scattered on the side of severity was larger than that on the side of duration or peak in addition the design pairs of cdfs of any two properties of each new simulation for a bivariate or trivariate return period deviated from the 1 1 diagonal however the pairs of maximum products of joint probability densities among large simulations were close to the 1 1 diagonal 4 5 design values of drought properties comparison of design values of drought properties between truncated and simulated samples is shown in fig 12 on the whole for each drought property the lines of scatter points with the ci of probability of 0 95 for the trivariate design were wider than those for the bivariate design it implied that the uncertainty of the former was larger than that of the latter then most pairs of design values on the basis of truncated and simulated samples were close to the 1 1 diagonal it demonstrated that the design value of each drought property between truncated and simulated samples slightly differed ultimately univariate bivariate and trivariate design values of drought properties for observed and naturalized series are shown in table 6 for a given univariate bivariate or trivariate return period the design value of each drought property of the observed series was conspicuously smaller than that of the naturalized series due to the regulation of water reservoirs for example compared to the naturalized series for the return period of droughts exceeding the percentile of 5 years as a case the duration severity and peak of observed series decreased by 48 8 51 7 from 6 19 to 6 38 months to 3 06 3 27 months by 77 3 79 4 from 1 994 to 2 067 billion m3 to 0 426 0 470 billion m3 and by 59 2 60 5 from 0 532 to 0 542 billion m3 to 0 211 0 217 billion m3 respectively the impact of water reservoirs on the severity was larger than that on the peak and the latter was larger than that on the duration then the relative change absolute value decreased as the return period of exceeding the percentile increased it implied that the impact of water reservoirs on the smaller drought was larger than that on the larger droughts however the differences of each drought property among the univariate bivariate and trivariate designs were slightly small compared to the univariate design the alternations of duration severity and peak of multivariate joint design were generally less than 5 they resulted from a high correlation of drought properties using the kendall return period instead of the conventional multivariate joint return period and the concentration of design combinations of the cdfs of drought properties on the 1 1 diagonal 5 conclusions in this paper an integrated procedure for design combinations of socioeconomic drought properties against the backdrop of regional water supply involving the truncation of drought events using the run method the goodness of fit of joint and marginal distributions of the properties using the gaussian copula and conventional univariate distributions the determination of design combinations of the properties for a given kendall return period using the most likely weight function and the evaluation of the uncertainty of the combinations using the confidence interval was developed besides in the dongjiang river basin univariate bivariate and trivariate design values of individual socioeconomic drought properties and their alterations due to the regulation of water reservoirs were investigated the main conclusions of this study are follows 1 for observed and naturalized series any two drought properties exhibited a high positive dependence the wbl and gaussian copula effectively fitted the marginal and joint distributions of drought properties respectively the multivariate design pairs of the cdfs of drought properties including the bivariate and trivariate designs were close to the 1 1 diagonal the differences in the design values of duration severity or peak between univariate bivariate and trivariate designs were small and their relative changes were less than 5 they resulted from the high correlation of drought properties the use of the kendall return period and the approximately identical cdfs in design combinations 2 for a given bivariate return period of drought properties the pairs of cdfs of any two drought properties formed a symmetric curve for truncated samples and a symmetric curving belt for large quantities of simulated samples for a given trivariate return period of drought properties the pairs of cdfs of duration and peak showed a good symmetry but those of duration and severity or severity and peak were remarkably scattered on the side of severity and comparatively concentrated on the side of duration or peak it implied that the uncertainty of severity was larger than that of duration and peak in the trivariate combination 3 design values of drought properties for each combination of new simulated samples partly changed in terms of the range of ci of probability of 0 95 the change of design value of the trivariate design was larger than that of the bivariate design it implied that the uncertainty of the former was larger than that of the latter however among large quantities of simulated samples the design values of each drought property of the selected one with the maximum product of joint probability densities were close to those of truncated samples 4 in the dongjiang river basin south china the impact of water reservoirs on the socioeconomic drought was very significant for example for the return period of droughts exceeding the percentile of 5 years the duration severity and peak decreased by 48 8 51 7 77 3 79 4 and 59 2 60 5 respectively but the drought spell and total volume and monthly maximum of water deficit for a given return period of 5 years still accounted for 3 06 3 27 months 0 426 0 470 billion m3 and 0 211 0 217 billion m3 respectively provided that the local water supply was met all in all in the multivariate design realization using the gaussian copula and the kendall return period no general analytical formulation for calculating the combination of marginal cdfs of drought properties for a given joint return period could be derived therefore in this paper the procedure for the most likely weight function proposed by salvadori et al 2011 was further improved and applied to the multivariate design of socioeconomic drought properties by which the uncertainty of multivariate design was evaluated in addition the socioeconomic drought in the case study was still serious even under the regulation of water reservoirs the regulation of reservoirs in the basin must be further improved and even the inter basin water transfer can be considered

6936,socioeconomic drought in association with minimum instream flow against the backdrop of local water supply was investigated an integrated procedure for design combinations of drought properties such as duration severity and peak involving the truncation of drought events the goodness of fit of joint and marginal distributions of drought properties the determination of design combinations of these properties for a given kendall return period and the evaluation of uncertainty of the combinations was developed in multivariate design of socioeconomic droughts in a case study univariate bivariate and trivariate design values of drought properties and their alterations due to the regulation of water reservoirs were computed results showed that any two properties of drought exhibited a high positive dependence for a given bivariate return period the pairs of cumulative frequencies of drought properties formed a symmetric curve for truncated samples and a symmetric curving belt for large quantities of simulated samples for a given trivariate return period the pairs of cumulative frequencies of duration and peak showed a symmetry but the pairs of duration and severity or severity and peak were remarkably scattered on the side of severity and comparatively concentrated on the side of duration or peak for the confidence interval of probability of 0 95 the range of trivariate design values was larger than that of bivariate design the differences between drought design values of univariate bivariate and trivariate designs were small which resulted from high correlations of drought properties the use of kendall frequency and approximate identical cumulative frequencies in design combinations the decrease of socioeconomic drought properties under the regulation of water reservoirs was significant but the drought spell total volume and monthly maximum of water deficit for a 5 year return period still accounted for 3 06 3 27 months 0 426 0 470 billion m3 and 0 211 0 217 billion m3 respectively provided that the local water supply was met keywords socioeconomic drought multivariate design copula function most likely weight function uncertainty water reservoirs 1 introduction the national drought mitigation center of usa considers drought as a creeping insidious natural hazard which originates from precipitation deficiency over an extended period of time and generally refers to water shortage which results in losses to agriculture and livestock socioeconomic disruption ecological environmental imbalance and even endangerment of human life impacts of drought result from the interplay between natural events and water demands of regional socio economy and can be exacerbated by human activities therefore drought cannot be treated exclusively as a physical phenomenon its definitions vary from field to field and its impacts vary from region to region dracup et al 1980 wilhite and glantz 1985 divided droughts into four categories meteorological agricultural hydrological or socioeconomic the first three types of droughts are viewed as a physical phenomenon and socioeconomic drought is associated with local water supply which tracks water demand through socioeconomic systems human impacts on the terrestrial hydrosphere are now so widespread that it is difficult to find a watershed that does not reflect the interaction among human activities and natural hydrologic processes wada et al 2013 vörösmarty et al 2010 van loon and van lanen 2013 vogel et al 2015 the newly emerging discipline of socio hydrology entailing links and feedbacks between water resources and society is receiving much attention these days wada et al 2011 sivapalan et al 2012 madani 2014 montanari 2015 sivapalan 2015 loucks 2015 troy et al 2015 wheater and gober 2015 as population industries and urbanization grow the water demand increases and socioeconomic drought becomes a major concern mehran et al 2015 socioeconomic drought thereby refers to the condition that water supply cannot satisfy demand leading to societal and economic disruptions and environmental impacts garen 1993 arab et al 2010 lapp 2012 sivapalan et al 2012 hill et al 2014 mehran et al 2015 wheater and gober 2015 socioeconomic drought as a seasonal deficit of precipitation combined with the increase of regional water demand due to climate change and regional development leading to increasing stress on water supply calls for further studies for measuring socioeconomic drought statistical indices e g reliability resilience and vulnerability first introduced by hashimoto et al 1982 have been developed moy et al 1986 jinno 1995 vogel and bolognese 1995 srinivasan et al 1999 vogel et al 1999 ward et al 2013 steinschneider and brown 2012 however these indices differ in their computational methodologies jain and bhunya 2008 mehran et al 2015 integrating resilience and vulnerability for multi reservoir systems is not easy miller et al 2010 in addition these indices cannot exhibit the frequency distribution of any of the important drought properties e g duration severity of water deficit etc which are generally concerned with water resources planning and management water supply usually entails withdrawals from rivers an appropriate flow in a certain section of river is maintained to preserve its ecological environment on one hand and guarantee the safety of various withdrawals for meeting water demands of socioeconomic systems on the other hand from another perspective the expected flow in association with water demand determines the occurrence and frequency of socioeconomic drought the socioeconomic drought properties including duration severity and peak can be analyzed on the basis of run method widely applied in hydrological drought analysis zelenhasic and salvai 1987 tallaksen et al 1997 tu et al 2016 zhang et al 2013 2015 by truncating a series of events less than the expected streamflow in practice frequency analysis of socioeconomic drought properties is similar to that of hydrological drought the difference is that the truncation level of hydrological drought is a flow of a certain percentile less than the average value of streamflow for example from q50 to q95 and that of the socioeconomic drought is closely associated with the requirement of instream flow for satisfying withdrawals of regional socioeconomic systems apparently drought properties of the truncated events are not only individual random processes but also have dependences between them that is a sequence of events is viewed as a multivariate random process in association with multivariate dependences copula functions which can model random variables and their dependences and their multivariate joint distributions have been widely applied in multivariate drought studies favre et al 2004 salvadori and de michele 2004 2007 shiau 2006 shiau et al 2007 dupuis 2007 modarres 2007 kao and rao 2010 song and singh 2010 mishra and singh 2010 2011 de michele et al 2013 chen et al 2013 2015 tu et al 2016 in the analysis of joint return period the kendall frequency was applied to improve the calculation of joint probability salvadori et al 2011 2013 chen et al 2013 jiang et al 2015 as shown by volpi and fiori 2014 for flood events occurring in a reservoir catchment the kendall frequency is not necessarily the safety standard for evaluating the joint distribution of multiple variables indeed it is a transfer of probability by defining a multivariate joint frequency as a random variable the transferred probability exceeding the percentile is larger than the original probability that is using the transfer becomes safer for design droughts from another point of view design values of multivariate return periods using the kendall frequency are equally comparable to those of individual univariate return periods in recent years multivariate design has received significant attention salvadori et al 2011 2013 volpi and fiori 2012 2014 vandenberghe et al 2012 serinaldi 2013 serinaldi and kilsby 2015 as a joint distribution of drought properties is determined by truncated samples how to determine a combination of drought properties for a given joint return period is perceived as a design realization of drought properties there is a one to one correspondence between return period and design value for an individual design property but a given joint return period actually leads to many combinations of drought properties and these combinations are generally not equivalent in practice however for drought management and mitigation of water deficit one may be expected to determine just one combination a most likely weight function with respect to a product of joint and marginal probability densities was proposed to exclusively determine one design combination of a given joint return period salvadori et al 2011 then using the confidence interval ci that includes critical events with a significant probability level the uncertainty of a design combination can be evaluated volpi and fiori 2012 2014 vandenberghe et al 2012 in addition reservoirs play a key role in managing water supply and reducing the impact of socioeconomic droughts nalbantis and koutsoyiannis 1997 nalbantis and tsakiris 2009 van loon and van lanen 2013 mehran et al 2015 at the end of the last century approximately 20 of the total global annual river discharge was controlled by man made reservoirs and 70 of global freshwater withdrawals came from these reservoirs fekete et al 1999 shiklomanov et al 2000 vörösmarty and sahagian 2000 indicating the importance of reservoirs in providing resilience for human water use globally zhang et al 2014b mehran et al 2015 the dongjiang river of south china is the main source for water supply of several booming megalopolises in the pearl river delta e g hongkong guangzhou shenzhen and dongguan due to its south subtropical humid climate zone the dongjiang river basin is rich in water resources resulting from average annual precipitation of 1770 mm with the rapid development of local socio economy the imbalance of water supply and demand has been increasing in the 21st century in addition streamflow processes in the dongjiang river have been significantly altered by human activities in particular the regulation of water reservoirs tu et al 2012 2015 zhang et al 2014a in the dongjiang river basin several studies have paid significant attention to hydrological droughts in association with a certain percentile of streamflow below the mean value chen et al 2013 zhang et al 2013 tu et al 2016 however socioeconomic droughts involving water demand of local socioeconomic systems become more important for local water resources management therefore in the dongjiang river basin as a case study multivariate design of socioeconomic drought in association with a minimum instream flow of water management was investigated in this paper drought events were truncated for monthly streamflows by using the run method the multivariate distribution of drought properties was determined by using the copula function the joint probability of drought properties exceeding the percentile was transferred by using the kendall frequency an integrated procedure of multivariate design of socioeconomic drought involving the evaluation of uncertainty on the basis of the most likely weight was proposed then univariate bivariate and trivariate design values of individual drought properties were compared and the impacts of water reservoirs on socioeconomic drought were evaluated 2 methodology 2 1 socioeconomic drought events a series of drought events using the run method can be truncated with a predefined threshold value of streamflow the selection of a truncation level depends on the type of drought to be studied dracup et al 1980 for hydrological drought a certain percentile of streamflow below the mean or median value can be set as the truncation level zelenhasic and salvai 1987 clausen and pearson 1995 tallaksen et al 1997 tu et al 2016 for socioeconomic drought the truncation level was set by minimum instream flow q m in order to satisfy the regional water supply or considering social economic development water environmental protection etc mathier et al 1992 madsen and rosbjerg 1995 tu et al 2017 as shown in fig 1 a drought event was characterized by duration d severity s peak p which respectively refer to drought spell total volume of water deficit during drought and maximum deficit for a certain time scale e g monthly between two adjacent drought events with longer duration and higher severity streamflow with shorter duration and smaller magnitude but beyond the threshold occur the two adjacent drought events were regarded to be subject to a drought which was split by the shorter streamflow exceeding the threshold therefore in consideration of inter event time and volume a criterion for pooling mutually dependent droughts was introduced by zelenhasic and salvai 1987 subsequently it was revised by madsen and rosbjerg 1995 and has been used zhang et al 2013 tu et al 2016 let d i s i p i and d i 1 s i 1 p i 1 be two adjacent droughts with a spell t i and excess volume of spell v i if the spell was less than a predefined critical duration t c and the ratio ρ i between the volume and that of the preceding deficit volume s i was less than a predefined critical value ρ c then d i s i p i and d i 1 s i 1 p i 1 were pooled into a new drought calculated as 1 d pool d i d i 1 t i s pool s i s i 1 v i p pool max p i p i 1 where d pool s pool and p pool refer to the duration severity and peak after the two adjacent drought events were pooled respectively see a dash cycle in the left part of fig 1 the pooling was ceaselessly repeated for the already pooled droughts by using eq 1 if both t i and ρ i were less than t c and ρ c see a dash oval in the right part of fig 1 using a monthly time scale a six month inter event time tc can be generally fixed as the critical duration due to half and half of wet and dry seasons within a year in this case study the critical ratio of excess volume of inter event time and the preceding deficit volume ρc can be set as 0 3 madsen and rosbjerg 1995 zhang et al 2013 2015 in practice the critical ratio ρc generally plays a key role in pooling together drought events 2 2 marginal and joint distributions of drought properties assume that x which refers to any one of duration d severity s peak p of drought is a continuous random variable f x which refers to its cumulative distribution function can be formulated as 2 f x p x x u where u also refers to a cumulative distribution frequency cdf non exceedance probability of duration severity or peak several conventional univariate distributions i e two parameter lognormal distribution logn and weibull distribution wbl and three parameter generalized extreme value distribution gev generalized logistic distribution glo and generalized normal distribution gno were fitted to the marginal distributions of drought properties then using the sklar theorem nelsen 2006 an m dimensional joint distribution function of drought properties h x 1 x m can be defined as 3 h x 1 x m c f x 1 f x m c u 1 u m where c u 1 u m is the m dimensional copula function which is the joint distribution function of standard uniform random variables within the range of 0 1 and u i f x i i 1 m refer to individual cdfs of drought properties and m 2 or m 3 for any two variables or three variables of drought properties respectively owing to its flexibility accessibility and simple parameters in association with a correlation coefficient matrix an m dimensional meta gaussian copula was selected for modeling the joint distribution of drought properties its theoretical cumulative distribution function c u 1 u m and density function c u 1 u m were deduced as follows genest and favre 2007 4 c u 1 u m b 1 b m g ω 1 ω d d ω 1 d ω m 5 c u 1 u m 1 2 exp ζ t σ 1 ζ 2 ζ t ζ 2 where 6 g ω 1 ω m 2 π m 2 σ 1 2 exp ω t σ 1 ω 2 where b 1 φ 1 u 1 b m φ 1 u m in which φ 1 refers to the inverse function of the standard normal distribution and ω ω 1 ω m t and ζ b 1 b m t are the matrices of variables in the integrand the correlation coefficient matrix σ was expressed as 7 σ 1 ρ 1 j ρ 1 m ρ i 1 ρ ij ρ im ρ m 1 ρ mj 1 ρ ij 1 i j ρ ji i j where ρ ij 1 1 refers to the correlation coefficient between any two drought properties for the goodness of fit of marginal and joint distributions of drought properties the anderson darling s a d test method panchenko 2005 dobric and schmid 2007 genest and favre 2007 song and singh 2010 ma et al 2013 tu et al 2016 was used for the marginal distribution of drought properties let x be any one of drought properties with a length of n then the a d statistic a n 2 was computed as 8 a n 2 n 1 n i 1 n 2 i 1 ln f x i ln 1 f x n i 1 where f x i is the cdf derived from the tested distribution for the joint distribution of drought properties with an m dimension a n 2 was formulated as 9 a n 2 n 1 n i 1 n 2 i 1 ln f s i ln 1 f s n i 1 where s i i 1 n refers to the pseudo observations of drought properties from a χ 2 2 distribution random variable for the bivariate or trivariate joint distribution of drought properties s was respectively calculated as 10 s φ 1 u 1 2 φ 1 c u 2 u 1 2 or 11 s φ 1 c u 1 u 2 2 φ 1 c u 3 c u 1 u 2 2 the bootstrap procedure for the goodness of fit test statistics of multi variate joint distribution a n 2 was employed dobric and schmid 2007 genest et al 2009 song and singh 2010 ma et al 2013 the critical value at the significance level α 0 05 for the goodness of fit test of theoretical individual and joint distributions of drought properties was obtained by the monte carlo method with 5000 simulations or more if a p value of the test statistic computed from the samples was more than the significance level the corresponding theoretical distribution was accepted for univariate distributions of drought properties root mean square error rmse and akaike information criterion aic were used to select the optimal distribution provided that several univariate theoretical distributions were accepted in addition empirical and theoretical distributions were compared for assessing the selected marginal and joint distributions of drought properties the empirical distribution function was defined as dobric and schmid 2007 genest et al 2009 tu et al 2016 12 f x 1 x m i 1 n i x 1 i x 1 x m i x m n where function i is an indicator function which is equal to one when the enclosed expression is true but is zero otherwise in hydrological practice the empirical probability was usually transformed as gringorten 1963 13 f e f x 1 x m 0 44 n 0 12 where m 1 m 2 or m 3 for any one variable any two variables or three variables of drought properties respectively 2 3 return periods of drought properties the selection of probabilities of a random variable below or exceeding the given percentiles depends on different hydrological questions for example the probabilities exceeding the percentiles are of main concern for drought properties for the multivariate combination various types in association with the operators and or and conditional can be used salvadori and de michele 2004 however in the statistical analysis of drought properties the individual probabilities of a combination of random variables simultaneously exceeding the percentiles were of main concern therefore for u i 1 u i i 1 2 3 referring to individual probabilities exceeding the percentiles of three properties of drought let c u 1 u 2 be the pair of bivariate exceedance probabilities of any two drought properties defined as 14 c u 1 u 2 1 i 1 2 u i c u 1 u 2 then let c u 1 u 2 u 3 be the trivariate exceedance probabilities of drought properties defined as 15 c u 1 u 2 u 3 1 i 1 3 u i i 1 2 j i 1 3 c u i u j c u 1 u 2 u 3 further a kendall function which is a univariate representation of multivariate information genest and rivest 1993 barbe et al 1996 salvadori et al 2011 2013 has been shown to be a good tool for calculating a copula based joint frequency of multivariate events nappo and spizzichino 2009 salvadori et al 2011 and has been applied in computing the joint return period of hydrological multivariables salvadori et al 2013 the kendall frequency was estimated as 16 k c q p c u 1 u m q 1 n i 1 n i c i q where q 0 1 is a probability level and n refers to the length of observed or simulated samples the method of solution refers to algorithms 1 and 2 presented by salvadori et al 2011 based on the above discussion t 1 of the univariate return period of drought properties was calculated by individual marginal probabilities exceeding the defined percentile as follows 17 t 1 e l u 1 where u 1 refers to the exceedance probability of any one of drought properties then using the kendall frequencies the bivariate and trivariate joint return periods of drought properties t 2 and t 3 were respectively calculated as 18 t 2 e l k c u 1 u 2 19 t 3 e l k c u 1 u 2 u 3 where k c u 1 u 2 and k c u 1 u 2 u 3 refers to the kendal frequency of joint distribution of any two variables and three variables of drought properties respectively and e l is the average inter arrival time of drought events the inter arrival time was defined as the time between consecutive arrivals if n denoted the length of years of sample data and n the lenght of drought events then e l was defined as 20 e l n n 2 4 design drought properties in design practice using the truncated drought samples the unvariate bivariate and trivariate distributions can be determined on the basis of the previously mentioned theoretical distributions for a given return period the monte carlo method was used to simulate new individual cdfs and combinations of cdfs of drought properties as is known a given return period corresponds to a cdf of individual drought properties for the univariate design but is associated with numerous combinations of cdfs for the bivariate or trivariate design therefore a design realization in association with the most likely weight function was proposed by salvadori et al 2011 the joint design of drought properties was derived as follows 21 u 1 u m arg max f x 1 x m 22 f x 1 x m c u 1 u m i 1 m f x i where u 1 u m is eventually selected as the design combination of cdfs of drought properties for a given joint return period with m 2 for any two properties of droughts and with m 3 for three properties of droughts and f x 1 x m refers to a product of joint probability density c u 1 u m and their individual marginal probability densities f x i i 1 m 2 5 uncertainty of multivariate design of drought properties in the bivariate design case a symmetrical curve of the vertex was formed by countless combinations for a given joint return period these bivariate combinations along the curve may not be equivalent from a practical design view point moreover the distance of each combination along the curve from its vertex can be denoted the limits of subset extending from two sides of the vertex were measured by evaluating the joint probability density in association with the confidence interval ci of a probability 1 α volpi and fiori 2012 in this case marginal frequencies of two variables on the vertex of the curve were regarded as identical however in the design realization the combination with the maximum of products of joint and marginal probability densities should be the core point from the curve for a given return period the core point may be off the vertex due to different individual marginal distributions for the multivariate design therefore the difference s k k 1 l which for any one combination was far from the core point was defined as 23 s k u 1 k u 1 2 u m k u m 2 where u 1 k u m k k 1 2 l and u 1 u m denote those selected combinations and the maximum of the products in the bivariate m 2 or trivariate m 3 design respectively then the uncertain range that included those combinations with the confidence interval of probability 1 α were limited based on order statistics of the difference s k k 1 l serinaldi 2013 2 6 procedure of multivariate design of drought properties for calculating design combinations of marginal cdfs of drought properties for a given joint return period no general analytical formulation can be derived for the gaussian copula in addition the simulated and design combinations for any given kendall return period were determined by the distribution parameters estimated using the truncated samples in design practice the monte carlo method was used for repeatedly simulating new combinations of drought properties with the identical length of the truncated samples the new estimated copula parameters resulted in the changes of simulated and design combinations that is the uncertainty of the estimated copula parameter needed to be considered therefore when the gaussian copula and the kendall return period were synthetically applied for the assessment of uncertainty an integrated procedure for the design combination of drought properties in the face of regional water supply was proposed as follows 1 truncating socioeconomic drought events from a streamflow process using the run method drought events including duration severity and peak were truncated with a predefined threshold value which refers to the minimum instream flow for satisfying the withdrawal for local socioeconomic systems the pooling of drought events was then considered 2 fitting joint and marginal distributions of drought properties for the truncated samples of drought properties the joint and marginal distributions and their parameters were determined by the goodness of fit of the recommended m dimensional meta gaussian copula and conventional univariate distributions 3 calculating the exceedance cdfs corresponding to a given kendall return period t k on the one hand the kendall cdf k c for the given kendall return period can be inversely calculated using eqs 18 and 19 on the other hand using the determined copula parameters fitting the samples large quantities of combinations of marginal cdfs of drought properties u 1 i u m i i 1 n 1 with the length of simulations n 1 were randomly generated by the monte carlo method their exceedance joint cdfs c i i 1 n 1 and kendall cdfs k c i i 1 n 1 were subsequently calculated using eqs 14 16 among them the exceedance joint cdf c i for which its corresponding kendall cdf k c i was closest to k c was selected as c t 4 acquiring combinations of marginal cdfs for the selected exceedance joint cdf u 1 j u m j j 1 n 2 with the length of simulations n 2 were newly generated by the monte carlo method and c j j 1 n 2 were also calculated for the selected exceedance joint cdf c t the allowable relative error re was defined as 24 c j c t c t re then in the simulated combinations u 1 j u m j j 1 n 2 those for which their exceedance cdfs satisfied equation 24 were selected that is the selected combinations u 1 k u m k k 1 l with the length of l which satisfied c k c t were found x 1 k x m k j 1 l corresponding to u 1 k u m k k 1 l can be inversely calculated 5 determining the design combination of marginal cdfs of drought properties from eqs 21 and 22 for all selected combinations the products of probability densities f x 1 k x m k k 1 l on the basis of joint probability densities c u 1 k u m k k 1 l and individual marginal probability densities f x 1 k f x m k k 1 2 l were calculated and u 1 u m with the maximum of the product from u 1 k u m k k 1 2 l was found as the design combination for the given kendall return period of drought properties t k 6 calculating design values for the determined combination of marginal cdfs of drought properties design values of each drought property were inversely calculated based on their individual marginal distributions 7 assessing the uncertainty for design combinations of drought properties new samples of drought properties with the identical length of truncated drought samples with n 3 times by using the monte carlo method were simulated and their copula parameters were estimated then when the procedure from 3 to 6 was repeatedly executed for each new combination of samples the design combinations u 1 k u m k k 1 n 3 with the length of n 3 were acquired from eq 24 design combinations that included the confidence interval with probability 1 α were limited based on order statistics serinaldi 2013 among them u 1 u m the maximum product of joint probability densities was eventually selected as the design combination from simulated samples 2 7 impact of water reservoirs as water reservoirs of a basin are constructed and operated observed streamflow substantially differs from its pristine version a usual method is that streamflow in the period influenced by reservoirs should be entirely returned van loon and van lanen 2013 let q o be the observed streamflow then the naturalized streamflow q n was defined as 25 q n q o δ q q o q in q out where δ q is the alteration of streamflow due to the operation of reservoirs and q in and q out refer to the inflow and outflow of reservoirs respectively 3 case study and data the dongjiang river basin is located in south china with clear wet and dry seasons shown in fig 2 three major reservoirs namely xinfengjiang fengshuba and baipenzhu with storages of 6 49 1 25 and 0 39 billion m3 have been in operation since 1961 1974 and 1986 respectively monthly streamflow data from the boluo station as the control station of the basin with a catchment area of 25 325 km2 were used they covered a common period of 56 hydrological years from april 1954 to march 2010 since the 1960 s surface water resources in the dongjiang river basin have been well developed tu et al 2012 streamflow in the main stream of the basin has been apparently influenced by the regulation of the above reservoirs tu et al 2012 2015 2017 on the basis of differences between inflow and outflow of individual reservoirs in terms of monthly time scale the observed series of streamflow at the boluo station can be returned to the naturalized series then with the rapid increase of water withdrawals of local socioeconomic systems the imbalance between water supply and demand has been growing increasingly in the 21st century in order to alleviate the imbalance in particular to secure water supply for the important cities of pearl river delta such as hong kong guangzhou and shenzhen the minimum instream flow of the boluo station has been implemented in recent years according to the water resources allocation scheme of the dongjiang river basin in guangdong province 2011 the minimum instream flow at the boluo station q m was set at 320 m3 s 1 approximately a percentile of 13 1 or 36 2 of the observed or naturalized monthly streamflow respectively therefore in terms of monthly streamflow both the naturalized series from april of 1954 to march of 2010 and the observed series from april of 1961 to march of 2010 were used in truncating socioeconomic drought events by comparing to the differences between univariate bivariate and trivariate design values of individual drought properties on the basis of two series impacts of water reservoirs on socioeconomic droughts were determined 4 results and discussion 4 1 drought properties from samples observed and naturalized series are illustrated in fig 3 the monthly observed and naturalized flows in terms of the average value with a small difference accounted for 741 and 758 m3 s 1 respectively however under the regulation of water reservoirs since 1961 low streamflows have significantly increased but drought events have remarkably decreased socioeconomic droughts of naturalized streamflows occurred 56 times during the period from 1954 to 2009 with a duration of 1 02 years and those of observed streamflows decreased to 28 times during the period from 1961 to 2009 with a duration of 0 58 year as shown in table 1 for naturalized flows the maximum drought lasted 17 months with the severity of 5 77 billion m3 and the peak of 0 68 billion m3 the average duration severity and peak accounted for 4 25 months 1 3 and 0 415 billion m3 respectively the severity of the minimum drought with a duration of a month accounted for 46 million m3 for observed flows the duration severity and peak of the maximum drought decreased to 6 months 1 78 and 0 51 billion m3 respectively the average duration severity and peak accounted for 2 48 months 0 375 and 0 176 billion m3 respectively the severity of the minimum drought with a month accounted for 3 million m3 due to the regulation of water reservoirs the duration severity and peak of the maximum drought decreased by 64 7 69 1 and 25 5 respectively the average duration severity and peak decreased by 41 6 71 1 and 57 6 respectively the severity of the minimum drought decreased by 93 3 in addition compared to the average values the median values of duration and severity for the naturalized series slightly decreased but the decreases for the observed series were large it implied that there were more events with shorter duration and lower severity under the regulation of water reservoirs 4 2 individual and joint distributions of drought properties the general statistical boxes of socioeconomic drought properties of observed and naturalized series are shown in fig 4 except that the maxima of duration and severity of the naturalized series were far from the extended boundary and the top three durations of the observed series were out of the extended boundary most samples of drought properties fell in the range of extended boundaries which were generally viewed as normal the goodness of fit test results of univariate distributions are shown in table 2 for the severity and peak of two series the p values of five univariate distributions were greater than the significant level of 0 05 except for the logn distribution of the peak of the naturalized series for the duration the p values of logn wbl and gno distributions for the observed series and only that of the wbl distribution for the naturalized were greater than the significant level these showed that the five univariate distributions almost fitted the severity and peak of drought but only the wbl distribution fitted all drought properties for the observed and naturalized series in addition comparing the rmse and aic values of the accepted distributions the optimal distribution of duration was wbl and that of the peak was gno for the two series the optimal distribution of severity was logn and gno for the observed and naturalized series respectively on the whole among the accepted distributions the rmse and aic values slightly differed and the p values of wbl for all properties of two series were the greatest as illustrated in fig 5 using the wbl distribution most points fell near the diagonal of 1 1 which implied small differences between the empirical and theoretical cdfs of individual drought properties therefore for convenience of comparison it was better to select wbl for modelling all marginal distributions of drought properties then between observed and naturalized series the wbl parameters of individual drought properties distinctly differed see table 3 as illustrated in fig 6 comparing the naturalized series the design curve of univariate return period of duration severity and peak of drought of the observed series remarkably moved down it denoted that univariate design values of drought properties decreased under the regulation of water reservoirs as shown in table 4 kendall τ spearman ρ and pearson γ of any two drought properties were greater than 0 5 implying that the dependences between them were high positive the differences of dependences between the two series in the combinations of duration and severity and duration and peak were small but were comparatively large in a combination of severity and peak as seen from fig 7 most points of the empirical and theoretical cdfs of the bivariate and trivariate distributions of drought properties fell closely to the diagonal of 1 1 except for those for the duration of observed series in the lower cdfs with a large drift which was attributed to more small droughts with a shorter duration for the observed series however the results of goodness of fit of joint distributions for drought properties showed that all p values were greater than the significant level of 0 05 see table 5 it demonstrated that using gaussian copula to fit the bivariate and trivariate distributions of drought properties was appropriate the estimated parameters of the gaussian copula on the samples of two series are shown in table 5 4 3 modelling and design of drought properties based on samples based on the selected marginal and joint distributions of the truncated samples of drought properties the equivalent scatter diagrams of the given bivariate kendall return periods exceeding the percentiles e g 5 years 10 years 20 years and 50 years are shown in fig 8 it is seen that the scatter points of a certain joint return period of any two variables of drought properties almost formed a symmetric curve of the diagonal of 1 1 then the differences of joint return period between observed and naturalized series were distinct compared to the naturalized series the curves of observed series shifted toward southwest it showed that the joint return period exceeding the percentile under the regulation of water reservoirs significantly increased for the identical bivariate pairs of drought properties in addition the design combinations of any two properties of drought were close to the 1 1 diagonal which implied that the marginal cdfs of any two properties were approximately identical in the bivariate design the given trivariate kendall return periods of the truncated samples of drought properties are shown in fig 9 in which subfigures are planar projections of the trivariate combinations the pairs of duration and peak in the combinations of duration severity and peak maintained a good symmetry around the 1 1 diagonal and formed an approximate curve with a tiny drift which decreased from the center to the two sides the pairs of duration and severity and severity and peak in the combinations of duration severity and peak maintained an approximate curve better on the side of duration or peak but were remarkably scattered on the side of severity the farther the distance to the 1 1 diagonal on the side of severity was the wider the drift of the pair of cdfs was the farther the distance to the 1 1 diagonal on the side of duration or peak was the more concentration on a curve of the pair of cdfs was these implied that the uncertainty of severity was larger than that of duration and peak for given trivariate joint return period of duration and severity and peak however the design combinations of any two properties of drought in the trivariate design were also close to the 1 1 diagonal 4 4 uncertainty of modeling and design of drought properties with 5000 simulations of new samples with the same length of truncated samples their bivariate and trivariate kendall return periods exceeding the percentiles are illustrated in figs 10 and 11 respectively for a given bivariate return period of any two variables of drought properties see fig 10 the simulated pairs of cdfs and those of the ci of a probability of 0 95 were symmetric about the 1 1 diagonal but they formed curving belts with a limited width in the direction of northeast southwest then the width in the ci along the two sides of the 1 1 diagonal differed for different pairs of the two drought properties the width of duration and peak was larger than that of duration and severity and that of the latter was larger than that of severity and peak for a given trivariate return period of drought properties see fig 11 the pairs of two drought properties formed a similar shape to that of truncated samples namely the pairs of duration and peak maintained a good symmetry about the 1 1 diagonal and formed a curving belt with a limited width of the direction of northeast southwest for duration and severity or severity and peak the range of the pairs scattered on the side of severity was larger than that on the side of duration or peak in addition the design pairs of cdfs of any two properties of each new simulation for a bivariate or trivariate return period deviated from the 1 1 diagonal however the pairs of maximum products of joint probability densities among large simulations were close to the 1 1 diagonal 4 5 design values of drought properties comparison of design values of drought properties between truncated and simulated samples is shown in fig 12 on the whole for each drought property the lines of scatter points with the ci of probability of 0 95 for the trivariate design were wider than those for the bivariate design it implied that the uncertainty of the former was larger than that of the latter then most pairs of design values on the basis of truncated and simulated samples were close to the 1 1 diagonal it demonstrated that the design value of each drought property between truncated and simulated samples slightly differed ultimately univariate bivariate and trivariate design values of drought properties for observed and naturalized series are shown in table 6 for a given univariate bivariate or trivariate return period the design value of each drought property of the observed series was conspicuously smaller than that of the naturalized series due to the regulation of water reservoirs for example compared to the naturalized series for the return period of droughts exceeding the percentile of 5 years as a case the duration severity and peak of observed series decreased by 48 8 51 7 from 6 19 to 6 38 months to 3 06 3 27 months by 77 3 79 4 from 1 994 to 2 067 billion m3 to 0 426 0 470 billion m3 and by 59 2 60 5 from 0 532 to 0 542 billion m3 to 0 211 0 217 billion m3 respectively the impact of water reservoirs on the severity was larger than that on the peak and the latter was larger than that on the duration then the relative change absolute value decreased as the return period of exceeding the percentile increased it implied that the impact of water reservoirs on the smaller drought was larger than that on the larger droughts however the differences of each drought property among the univariate bivariate and trivariate designs were slightly small compared to the univariate design the alternations of duration severity and peak of multivariate joint design were generally less than 5 they resulted from a high correlation of drought properties using the kendall return period instead of the conventional multivariate joint return period and the concentration of design combinations of the cdfs of drought properties on the 1 1 diagonal 5 conclusions in this paper an integrated procedure for design combinations of socioeconomic drought properties against the backdrop of regional water supply involving the truncation of drought events using the run method the goodness of fit of joint and marginal distributions of the properties using the gaussian copula and conventional univariate distributions the determination of design combinations of the properties for a given kendall return period using the most likely weight function and the evaluation of the uncertainty of the combinations using the confidence interval was developed besides in the dongjiang river basin univariate bivariate and trivariate design values of individual socioeconomic drought properties and their alterations due to the regulation of water reservoirs were investigated the main conclusions of this study are follows 1 for observed and naturalized series any two drought properties exhibited a high positive dependence the wbl and gaussian copula effectively fitted the marginal and joint distributions of drought properties respectively the multivariate design pairs of the cdfs of drought properties including the bivariate and trivariate designs were close to the 1 1 diagonal the differences in the design values of duration severity or peak between univariate bivariate and trivariate designs were small and their relative changes were less than 5 they resulted from the high correlation of drought properties the use of the kendall return period and the approximately identical cdfs in design combinations 2 for a given bivariate return period of drought properties the pairs of cdfs of any two drought properties formed a symmetric curve for truncated samples and a symmetric curving belt for large quantities of simulated samples for a given trivariate return period of drought properties the pairs of cdfs of duration and peak showed a good symmetry but those of duration and severity or severity and peak were remarkably scattered on the side of severity and comparatively concentrated on the side of duration or peak it implied that the uncertainty of severity was larger than that of duration and peak in the trivariate combination 3 design values of drought properties for each combination of new simulated samples partly changed in terms of the range of ci of probability of 0 95 the change of design value of the trivariate design was larger than that of the bivariate design it implied that the uncertainty of the former was larger than that of the latter however among large quantities of simulated samples the design values of each drought property of the selected one with the maximum product of joint probability densities were close to those of truncated samples 4 in the dongjiang river basin south china the impact of water reservoirs on the socioeconomic drought was very significant for example for the return period of droughts exceeding the percentile of 5 years the duration severity and peak decreased by 48 8 51 7 77 3 79 4 and 59 2 60 5 respectively but the drought spell and total volume and monthly maximum of water deficit for a given return period of 5 years still accounted for 3 06 3 27 months 0 426 0 470 billion m3 and 0 211 0 217 billion m3 respectively provided that the local water supply was met all in all in the multivariate design realization using the gaussian copula and the kendall return period no general analytical formulation for calculating the combination of marginal cdfs of drought properties for a given joint return period could be derived therefore in this paper the procedure for the most likely weight function proposed by salvadori et al 2011 was further improved and applied to the multivariate design of socioeconomic drought properties by which the uncertainty of multivariate design was evaluated in addition the socioeconomic drought in the case study was still serious even under the regulation of water reservoirs the regulation of reservoirs in the basin must be further improved and even the inter basin water transfer can be considered to ensure the safety of increasing local water supply acknowledgments supported by the national key r d program of china 2017yfc0405900 and the national natural science foundation of china 51879288

6937,elevated concentration and high variance of dissolved organic carbon doc in surface waters are a challenge for the production of drinking water past studies have indicated a dominant role of wetlands in doc mobilization but have mainly been focused on boreal and oceanic catchments here we analyze the observational doc time series from 89 temperate humid catchments which drain into german drinking water reservoirs we characterize the doc concentration median and variability and utilize partial least squares regression in order to quantify the relation to catchment characteristics such as land use climate and topography we found that the long term median doc concentration in the catchment is well predicted by the 90th percentile of the distribution of the topographic wetness index 0 9p twi over the entire catchment area the 0 9p twi can be directly connected to the abundance of riparian wetlands in the catchments doc concentration variability represented as the ratio of the interquartile range and the median concentrations was also found to be well predictable concentration variability was highest in cold and wet catchments with a high 0 9p twi here we also found stronger correlations between doc concentrations and discharge with positive concentration discharge patterns catchments with elevated doc concentration variance also exhibited the most severe long term increases in concentrations our results thus indicate that in temperate climates riparian wetlands can be the dominant source zones of doc and control the hydrological mobilization and potentially also the spatial difference in long term concentration trends observed in surface waters we conclude that the dominance of topography and climatic conditions in controlling spatio temporal patterns in doc concentrations leads to very limited management options keywords catchment carbon cycle riparian zone time series analysis mobilization 1 introduction dissolved organic carbon doc in surface waters plays an important role in the global carbon cycle battin et al 2009 cole et al 2007 and serves as a vital fuel for aquatic ecosystems solomon et al 2015 tank et al 2010 increasing concentrations of doc in many surface water systems across the northern hemisphere over the last decades monteith et al 2015 musolff et al 2017c worrall and burt 2007 have raised the awareness of researchers and practitioners high concentrations of doc put pressure on drinking water resources via the potential formation of disinfection byproducts sadiq and rodriguez 2004 as well as through negative effects on the biological stability park et al 2016 and filter run times eikebrokk et al 2004 in water treatment facilities doc is mostly mobilized from soils at the interface between terrestrial and aquatic systems laudon et al 2011 ledesma et al 2017 and exported towards downstream water resources e g drinking water reservoirs from the practitioners point of view questions arise as to what extent the doc concentration levels short term variability and long term trends are predictable and as to how their characteristics are influenced by catchment management activities thus a better understanding of doc source distribution and mobilization as well as of turnover processes their controls and the resulting short term and long term concentration variability is needed observational datasets utilizing routinely monitored doc at catchment outlets are commonly used for analyzing concentration and export variability over longer time spans clark et al 2010 however the spatial scale at which biogeochemical reactions and hydrological mobilization take place is much smaller than the scale integrated in observations at the catchment outlet nevertheless this kind of top down analysis allows for the determination of the problem s extent and for a deduction of dominant processes at the management scale in recent years a large number of observational studies with differing hypotheses on doc concentration dynamics have been proposed and published which makes it hard to conclusively answer the questions raised above clark et al 2010 often studies are dedicated to just one aspect of doc concentrations in surface water a controlling factors of long term monotonic trends in doc concentrations b controlling factors of average doc concentration levels or c controlling factors of inter and intra annual variability the different temporal scales of doc concentration variability long term average monotonic trend inter annual intra annual need to be carefully separated from each other when being assessed as they can mask each other clark et al 2010 temnerud et al 2014 moreover different catchments may exhibit a different sensitivity to the same controlling factor as a result of different landscape compositions clark et al 2010 erlandsson et al 2008 monteith et al 2015 consequently it is unlikely that there will be one unifying theory on the key factors which control doc concentration trends and variability which will be applicable to all catchments across the northern hemisphere clark et al 2010 however the literature has provided some key findings on important controls of doc concentrations in surface waters 1 average concentrations and fluxes can be related to the proportion of wetlands and peat soils in the catchment aitkenhead et al 1999 creed et al 2008 dillon and molot 1997 laudon et al 2004 monteith et al 2015 meaning that only a small fraction of the catchment is the dominant source zone of the doc observed in the stream over a wider hydro climatic range the relationship to wetlands is controlled by the mean annual temperature mat laudon et al 2012 weyhenmeyer and karlsson 2009 as it determines the potential of a catchment to produce remove and accumulate doc and to enable fluvial exports 2 there are two general hypotheses which can explain the long term trends of doc concentrations see review by clark et al 2010 and references therein trends are either related to climate change via temperature precipitation and discharge changes de wit et al 2016 freeman et al 2001 weyhenmeyer et al 2014 worrall and burt 2007 or to changes in atmospheric sulphur deposition de wit et al 2016 monteith et al 2007 or n deposition musolff et al 2017c 3 the intra annual variability of doc concentrations is typically much larger than the variability induced by long term trends and is mostly controlled by discharge and temperature variability hytteborn et al 2015 laudon et al 2011 seibert et al 2009 winterdahl et al 2014 winterdahl et al 2016 wetlands are seen as the dominant source zones of doc but not all wetlands are hydrologically connected to the stream in the same way surface waters draining from mires with peat soils are usually high in doc concentration laudon et al 2004 and laudon et al 2011 for example showed that boreal streams in peatland dominated catchments exhibit dilution patterns in doc concentrations with increasing discharge due to surficial flow paths bypassing the doc source zones the same was found by birkel et al 2017 in a german bog in contrast riparian wetlands are recognized as the dominant source zones that are only activated during high flow periods bishop et al 2004 dick et al 2015 laudon et al 2011 ledesma et al 2015 seibert et al 2009 here the temporal dynamics of the shallow groundwater table is the key factor which controls the doc release from riparian soils under low flow conditions with low groundwater levels lateral transport is generally suppressed by low hydraulic conductivity in deeper soil layers in contrast high groundwater levels can interfere with the shallow organic soil layers which have a higher hydraulic conductivity than deeper soil layers allowing for a fast lateral export of doc seibert et al 2009 winterdahl et al 2011 consequently doc concentrations increase with increasing discharge bishop et al 2004 musolff et al 2015 seibert et al 2009 strohmeier et al 2013 this process was shown to be dominant not only in boreal till soils but also in temperate forested catchments knorr 2013 strohmeier et al 2013 as well as in agriculturally used lands jeanneau et al 2015 note that in warmer climates such as the subhumid mediterranean the tight connection between the riparian zone and the surface water in headwater streams can be significantly altered by instream processing bernal et al 2018 ledesma et al 2015 showed the importance of local hydro morphology i e the width of the riparian zone in controlling the exported doc loads consequently morphological indices such as the mean topographic wetness index twi andersson and nyberg 2009 grabs et al 2012 ledesma et al 2015 the mean elevation above stream laudon et al 2012 the slope creed et al 2003 or results from more complex topographical analyses creed et al 2008 all based on digital elevation models dems can be used as proxies for delineating doc source zones methods based on dem analysis also account for cryptic wetlands which are covered by a closed canopy surface and therefore not visible in the normal land use analyses creed et al 2003 most of the observationally studies on doc are based on data from boreal and oceanic climates de wit et al 2016 laudon et al 2012 monteith et al 2007 tetzlaff et al 2013 winterdahl et al 2014 worrall and burt 2007 see also fig 5 there are surprising few studies which incorporated large catchment scale datasets of doc concentrations from humid continental climates musolff et al 2017c oulehle and hruska 2009 sucker et al 2011 elevated and long term increasing doc concentrations were found to also threaten drinking water reservoirs within humid continental germany musolff et al 2017c this study found strong evidence that increasing doc concentrations are linked to an increase in the reductive mobilization of iron iii minerals as a consequence of declining atmospheric nitrate input these processes were found to be most pronounced in catchments with low topographic gradients which are more prone to facilitate wetland soils as the potential doc source zone however according to montanarella et al 2006 germany is far less dominated by wetland soils 5 of total area than the uk 22 6 or sweden 24 9 moreover only a small fraction of these wetlands actually occurs in mountainous areas rosskopf et al 2015 where the problem of increasing doc concentrations in drinking water reservoirs is most pressing musolff et al 2017c this raises the question of whether and to what extent the source zones and mobilization mechanisms in these central european catchments are comparable to those in more northern latitudes although previous studies as mentioned above have provided many different sometimes conflicting explanations for the instream doc concentration magnitude and variability of instream doc concentrations there is growing evidence that general patterns and dynamics are encoded in a manageable number of key characteristics of the catchment and its geo and hydrochemical inventory following this idea the main objective of our work is to explain differences in doc concentrations in catchment outflows across a set of humid german catchments more specifically the aim is to characterize average doc concentrations as well as intra annual doc concentration variability we quantify and discuss their connections to and predictability based on generic catchment characteristics such as topography climate and land use finally we elaborate on the ramifications for doc concentration management at the catchment scale we use a large data set of hydrochemical variables and data on catchment characteristics from a set of 89 catchments which drain into drinking water reservoirs in germany rather than trying to explain the dynamics in one or a few specific catchments we utilize this large sample data base to identify general patterns and key explanatory factors controlling the doc concentration behaviors across temperature humid catchments 2 materials and methods 2 1 data base we compiled water chemical and catchment data from 89 catchments draining into 35 german drinking water reservoirs the catchments are distributed throughout germany whereby the selection focuses on low mountain ranges where surface water is the major source for drinking water production fig 1 here land management activities are restricted to ensure high water quality this includes the ban of manure as fertilizer the use of buffer strips and crop rotation aiming at low nutrient surplus we selected catchments that do not contain lakes or reservoirs with a surface area of more than 0 01 km2 within a distance of 5 km upstream from the sampling point in total about 16 000 samples collected between 1993 and 2013 were considered with an average of 180 samples per catchment and 11 samples per year this data is part of an extended data base containing 110 catchments which has been used by musolff et al 2017c for analyzing long term concentration trends of doc dissolved iron phosphate and nitrate as the focus in this study was on analyzing intra annual variability in concentration the dataset was reduced from 110 to 89 catchments considering only catchments which had a mean sampling frequency of more than seven samples per year with at least seven years of valid data samples were taken as grab samples and analyzed following a standard protocol wasserchemische gesellschaft 2014 doc was measured after filtration through a 0 7 µm glass fiber filter dissolved iron fed and soluble reactive phosphorous srp are defined as the fraction passing a 0 45 µm filter specific uv absorbance suva refers to the specific absorbance at 254 nm normalized for the doc concentration other water quality parameters which were taken into consideration included ph and the concentrations of nitrate no3 sulfate so4 magnesium mg and calcium ca the daily total precipitation measurements taken at the reservoir dam were available for all catchments over the entire observation period the values were aggregated to calculate the long term mean annual sums for each catchment discharge measurements at the time and place of sampling were available for 20 of the study catchments we used gis analysis esri arcgis and saga to delineate the catchment areas based on fine resolution 10 m dem data and to derive the mean elevation and slope estimates the probability distribution of the topographic wetness index twi is used to characterize the potential for soil wetness and size of riparian wetlands the twi ln a tanβ introduced by beven and kirkby 1979 relates the upslope area of each dem cell a to the local slope β a visualization of the twi along a hillslope can be found in fig 2 we performed a monte carlo assessment to derive the twi in different virtual hillslope settings in order to better evaluate which characteristic of the twi probability distribution e g mean median quantiles best represents the extent of riparian wetlands details can be found in the supporting information information on land usage proportions was derived using the german topographical information system atkis mean annual temperature mat as well as potential evapotranspiration etp and the aridity index ai given as the ratio of mean annual precipitation and mean annual etp was derived from a germany wide data set available at a spatial resolution of 4 km 4 km zink et al 2017 the long term mean annual climatic characteristics mat ai correspond to the time period 1950 2013 in order to compare our data with those of other data driven studies on doc within europe we used the gridded products of daily precipitation and temperature data from the e obs v14 0 haylock et al 2008 provided by the european climate assessment and datasets eca d project the e obs dataset is available at around 25 km spatial resolution and the climate characteristics estimated correspond to the period 1950 2015 the potential evapotranspiration for both german and e obs datasets was calculated using the hargreaves and samani method hargreaves and samani 1982 2 2 statistical methods solute concentrations in the surface water are typically lognormally distributed jawitz and mitchell 2011 we used the median and the ratio of interquartile range iqr 0 75 percentile 0 25 percentile and median to characterize average concentrations and concentration variability this relative concentration variability iqrm in the following is a robust measure of variability the form of which is analogous to the coefficient of variation with the advantage that its interpretation does not require the underlying data to follow a specific distribution recently winterdahl et al 2014 used a similar measure ratio of range to median here we refer to iqrm as it is not as sensitive to outlying extreme concentrations as range statistics are concentrations often systematically change with discharge amount and with season hirsch et al 2010 temnerud et al 2014 the relation of concentrations to discharge can be used to classify solute export and to identify dominant mobilization processes at catchment scale godsey et al 2009 jawitz and mitchell 2011 musolff et al 2017a musolff et al 2015 here we use the slope b and pearson s correlation coefficient rq of the linear regression of the logarithm of concentration and the logarithm of discharge observations musolff et al 2017a the seasonality of doc concentration is quantified by rt based on the linear regression of the logarithm of concentration with water temperature both rq and rt are based on detrended doc concentration time series assuming a long term linear trend note that rq and rt are also used by winterdahl et al 2014 but as spearman s rank correlation coefficient here we refer to pearson s correlation coefficient to be consistent with the doc concentration variance explained by the linear regression with these two factors also note that potential shifts in the seasonality over the years e g systematic warmer or wetter springs are better captured by this approach as it does not rely on day of the year or month as a predictor spearman s rank correlation analysis is used to characterize bivariate relations of median doc concentrations as well as concentration variability iqr iqrm with other variables partial least squares regression pls wold et al 2001 is used to quantify the predictive power of catchment characteristics to median doc concentrations and iqrm the pls analysis is suitable for these kind of data driven analyses wherein different catchment characteristics predictors often exhibit collinearities musolff et al 2015 onderka et al 2012 for instance the share of agricultural land use is typically correlated to metrics of topography a fact which hampers a sound regression analysis carrascal et al 2009 pls is able to handle these collinearities by constructing latent variables from predictors and response wold et al 2001 the results are interpreted by making use of the variable influence on projection vip and by the regression coefficient while the vip determines the most influential predictors vip 1 is considered to be most relevant the regression coefficient indicates the direction of the relationship we used the package pls in the r environment with the nipals nonlinear iterative partial least squares algorithm the mean squared error of prediction was used to choose the optimal number of underlying components mevik and cederkvist 2004 details can also be found in musolff et al 2015 we also performed one way analysis of variance anova to test if groups of variables have significantly different means the statistical significance of the differences is evaluated at 5 significance level i e p value 0 05 in cases of diverging variance we applied the welch correction zimmerman 2004 3 results 3 1 catchment characteristics the catchments span a wide range of topography and land use characteristics as well as climatic conditions tab 1 however since all catchments drain into drinking water reservoirs our dataset is slightly biased to first order catchments lying in low mountain ranges with a relatively high fraction of forest cover based on the land use classification only one of the 89 catchments incorporates wetlands defined here as peatland and swamp areas of more than 1 ha in size notably this analysis does not account for cryptic wetlands under the canopy and narrow riparian wetlands along the streams although forests dominate most catchments water quality conditions cannot be described as pristine the climate is humid with annual potential evapotranspiration etp near or below the annual precipitation p since etp is less variable than p the resulting aridity index ai is mainly controlled by p the mean annual air temperature is mainly related to the altitude fig s1 the mean annual discharge q ranges between 15 and 76 median 32 of p agricultural and urban land use as well as atmospheric deposition of n species alewell et al 2001 sucker et al 2011 led to elevated concentrations of no3 and srp 3 2 median doc concentration median doc concentrations in the studied catchments span an order of magnitude from below 1 mg l to above 10 mg l table 1 the correlation analysis fig s1 reveals strongest correlations of median doc concentration with the 90th percentile of the topographic wetness index twi 0 9p with a spearman s rank correlation coefficient rs of 0 76 and a negative correlation with the mean slope in the catchment rs 0 63 land use variables and hydro climate parameters are only weakly correlated to the median doc concentrations rs 0 5 the correlation analysis with hydro chemical variables reveals a co occurrence of doc with fed rs 0 59 but only a weaker correlation to all other parameters rs 0 5 the correlation analysis also shows the expected strong collinearities among the group of land use variables e g arable land vs forest cover rs 0 88 hydro climate variable e g discharge vs precipitation rs 0 96 and hydro chemistry variables e g ca vs mg rs 0 82 we utilize partial least squares regression pls to predict median doc and to systematically analyze the contribution of all possible groups of predictors land use and topography hydro climate and hydro chemistry we excluded discharge from the hydro climatic predictors at this point due to the limited availability of discharge measurements at the sampling locations moreover we also excluded dissolved iron fed from the main pls analysis for all 89 catchments for the same reason however since relationship between doc and fed has already been discussed in terms of long term trends for the same set of catchments musolff et al 2017c we added a pls analysis including fed for 62 catchments to the supporting information as well as a short discussion further below the pls model explains 76 of the variance in median doc concentrations in the catchments taking all predictors into account table 2 according to the vip ranking catchment topography in terms of the twi 0 9p and the mean slope appear to be the most important predictors while climate characteristics p and mat and altitude are less important this is reflected in the pls analysis when taking groups of predictors into account tables s2 s4 the hydro chemical r2 0 29 table s2 and hydro climatic variables r2 0 31 table s3 alone cannot sufficiently explain the spatial differences in median doc concentrations while the group of topography and land use variables jointly explains 64 of the variance table s4 a simple power law model of the median doc as a function of twi 0 9p explains 60 of the variance fig 3 including measurements of fed into the pls analysis and reducing the number of catchments to 62 increases explained variance by 4 when all predictors are taken into account table s5 here fed is of similar importance as twi 0 9p adding fed to the group of hydro chemical variables increases the explained variance to 62 with fed and srp as the most important predictors of median doc concentrations table s6 3 3 doc concentration variability the iqr as a measure of doc concentration variability varies significantly among the catchments 0 3 mg l to 12 2 mg l table 3 moreover the iqr is positively correlated with the median concentration rs 0 87 catchments with a high median concentration also exhibit a high concentration variability a linear model of iqr as a function of median doc concentration reveals a slope of 0 69 r2 0 72 p 0 01 when the median doc concentration increases by 1 mg l across the catchments iqr increases by 0 69 mg l the size of this slope refers to 50 2 of the median doc concentration of all catchments this iqr increase with increasing median concentration was found to be much stronger for doc than for other substances such as so4 1 1 r2 0 71 or ca 1 8 r2 0 74 due to the strong scaling of iqr of doc concentrations with the median concentrations we put greater emphasis on the analysis of iqrm the ratio of the iqr and the median table 3 iqrm varies considerably between the catchments spanning one order of magnitude we utilize metrics that give insight into potential controls of doc concentration variability pearson s correlation coefficient between doc concentrations and water temperature rt as well as discharge rq using lncdoc and lnq in general rt is more often positive than negative 17 out of 89 catchments in contrast rq is positive in only half of the studied catchments which had discharge measurements available 10 out of 20 catchments the absolute value of rq appears stronger for the positive correlation median 0 09 than for the negative correlation median 0 03 the rank correlation analysis fig s2 reveals few significant correlations of the iqr and the relative iqrm of doc concentration to both the catchment characteristics and the hydro chemical variables for the iqr strong rank correlation with rs greater than 0 6 can be found with median doc concentration 0 87 with twi 0 9p 0 74 and with fed 0 67 for iqrm the aridity index 0 60 showed strongest rank correlation in contrast other metrics rt rq and slope b exhibit significant and strong rank correlations in only a few cases there is however a strong correlation among the metrics rt vs rq 0 77 rt vs slope b 0 77 rq vs slope b 0 99 these relations indicate that there is a continuum between catchments with a stronger correlation between doc concentration and water temperature on the one hand and catchments with a stronger correlation between doc concentrations and discharge fig s3a as well as steeper c q slopes on the other hand fig s3b all other correlations although significant are less than 0 6 rt is related to fed and etp rq and slope b to etp note that there is no significant rank correlation of rt and rq with iqrm but a significant pearson s correlation between rq and iqrm rpears 0 62 p 0 01 exists i e catchments with a strong correlation between discharge and doc concentrations also exhibit high relative concentration variability the relationships between iqrm and rt rq and slope b are visualized in fig 4 a c catchments with a low relative doc concentration variability iqrm 0 5 exhibit comparable absolute correlation factors to discharge and water temperature median absolute rt 0 12 rq 0 09 however elevated relative doc concentration variability iqrm 0 5 goes along with a stronger correlation with discharge but not with temperature median absolute rt 0 15 rq 0 40 according to the anova test results the differences between the two groups of catchments with high and low doc variability are significant for rq p 0 05 but not for rt p 0 05 it is worth noting that there are distinct differences in the occurrence of significant monotonic long term trends in doc concentrations among the studied catchments fig 4d catchments with lower relative concentration variability iqrm 0 5 n 55 are characterized by both negative n 20 and positive concentration trends n 12 with an overall median slope of 0 019 mg l a in contrast catchments with higher concentration variability iqrm 0 5 n 34 only show positive trends n 23 with an overall median slope of 0 112 mg l a both groups are significantly different from each other p 0 05 consequently the most severe positive concentration trends in terms of absolute changes occur in catchments with elevated relative concentration variability this is also expressed in a positive correlation between absolute significant concentration trends and iqrm rs 0 58 p 0 01 fig 4d as well as relative significant trends normalized by median doc concentrations and iqrm rs 0 52 p 0 01 the pls analysis reveals that the relative concentration variability iqrm of the individual catchments is generally predictable from catchment characteristics table 4 r2 0 63 such as topography twi 0 9p hydroclimate ai and hydro chemical variables srp ph so4 mg ca this indicates that catchments with a high iqrm are characterized by a higher topographic wetness index and wetter climatic conditions high annual precipitation and high ai on the one hand and lower so4 and ca and high srp and ph on the other hand taking only the seven most important predictors into account listed in table 4 the model explains 50 of the variance of iqrm topography land use and climate alone can predict 50 of the variance of iqrm table s8 whereas hydro chemical variables alone can explain only 41 table s9 including fed into the pls analysis slightly increases the predictability of iqrm from r2 0 63 to 0 71 table s10 vip values indicate that fed is an important albeit not the most important predictor the coefficient indicates that a high iqrm goes along with elevated fed concentrations 4 discussion 4 1 controls of median doc concentrations the doc concentrations in the studied temperate humid german catchments median value of 2 98 mg l are comparable to concentrations reported for catchments in the uk monteith et al 2015 median 4 1 mg l and france moatar et al 2017 median 4 45 mg l but much lower than the results given by winterdahl et al 2014 from sweden median 9 5 mg l or by de wit et al 2016 from boreal sites in norway sweden and finland median boreal wet 8 1 mg l to boreal dry 10 5 mg l the pls analysis revealed that catchment topography is the dominant control of differences in the median doc concentration across the 89 studied catchments catchments with a high twi 0 9p and low slopes generally exhibited high doc concentrations the twi 0 9p predictor alone could explain 60 of the variance in median doc concentrations past studies have found the fractions of wetlands peatlands to be a major factor controlling average doc concentrations dick et al 2015 hytteborn et al 2015 monteith et al 2015 tiwari et al 2017 winterdahl et al 2014 however our study catchments from the german low mountain ranges do not exhibit widespread occurrence of wetlands based on soil and land use maps rosskopf et al 2015 our analysis suggests that riparian wetlands which are not encoded in land use maps but could be deduced from topographical maps are the dominant source zone for doc throughout the catchments notably previous literature has shown that the twi is connected to riparian wetlands in terms of depths to groundwater grabs et al 2012 ledesma et al 2015 soil moisture wilson et al 2004 soil wetness agren et al 2014 toc content of soil water grabs et al 2012 thickness of the organic soil layer seibert et al 2007 and riparian vegetation patterns shoutis et al 2010 these studies link the twi at a given point within the catchment to local measurements here we utilized the twi probability distribution of the entire catchment as the twi scales with the length of a hillslope accumulating upslope area the average twi may not be a good measure for effectively characterizing the width of the riparian zones within a catchment we systematically tested the predictive power of different metrics of the twi probability with regards to the width of the riparian zone by constructing virtual hillslopes with different properties length height width see si text and fig 2 s4 and s5 the 90th percentile of the twi distribution was found to be the best predictor of the width of the riparian zone for a hillslope tested against median 75th 95th percentile and areas with twi 8 we transferred this metric twi 0 9p to the catchment scale which generally performed better in the rank correlation analysis than other tested topography metrics see si text although we recognize that a more complex and detailed spatial analysis of the twi can be done for individual catchments e g mengistu et al 2014 this is not within the scope of this study moreover we note that the twi analysis incorporates hydrologically connected riparian as well as disconnected wetlands they cannot be considered to be independent of each other as a catchment with a low topographic gradient mean slope will have a high probability for high a twi and the occurrence of isolated and connected wetlands andersson and nyberg 2009 nevertheless our aim here is to present a simple yet powerful metric that can easily be derived from an available topographic dataset and can generally be used across a range of catchments we argue that the dem derived twi 0 9p which is typically more readily available than high resolution soil and land cover maps can be a suitable measure for the width of the riparian zone in catchments based on this metric our data driven analysis provides strong evidence that the riparian soils are the dominant source zone of doc in the studied catchments the presence of pronounced riparian wetlands promotes high concentrations of doc as it allows the accumulation of organic carbon in direct vicinity of the stream network which in turn can be quickly transferred to the stream in the form of doc bishop et al 2004 ledesma et al 2015 seibert et al 2009 in contrast the absence of riparian wetlands in steeper catchments does not allow for such a direct connectivity between pools of organic carbon in the catchment and the stream and therefore leads to an overall lower doc concentration level 4 2 controls of doc concentration variability our analysis shows that catchments with a high relative concentration variability iqrm of doc generally have a stronger positive correlation between concentration and discharge rq in contrast the correlation of concentrations to water temperature rt was found to be independent of iqrm this indicates that overall concentration variability was more controlled by short term discharge dynamics than by seasonal temperature related concentration changes our results show a negative relationship between rq and rt across german catchments that is comparable to the findings of winterdahl et al 2014 for catchments in southern sweden winterdahl et al 2014 hypothesized that this continuum between more flow driven or more temperature driven concentration dynamics across catchments can be explained by contrasting doc mobilization mechanisms in two general types of catchments in catchments with shallow organic soil horizons doc mobilization is dominated by discharge events that activate the shallow doc source layers high rq low rt whereas in catchments with thick organic peat soils doc sources does not change much during discharge events and concentration dynamics are dominated by temperature driven biological doc production high rt negative rq this hypothesis was then backed up by soil water profile data in a follow up study by winterdahl et al 2016 the correlation and pls analysis of catchment controlling factors presented here revealed that wet lower etp higher ai p and q and cold higher altitude lower mat catchments with wide riparian zones higher twi 0 9p exhibit an overall higher doc concentration variability iqrm with a stronger positive correlation between doc concentration and discharge as well as steeper c q slopes we argue here that the doc variability is dominated by carbon mobilized from riparian wetlands in these catchments at the same time riparian wetlands act as discharge generating zones and as the dominant source zones of doc birkel et al 2014 bishop et al 2004 dick et al 2015 ledesma et al 2015 musolff et al 2015 musolff et al 2017c seibert et al 2009 more specifically the shallow organic layers of the riparian soils are the main source zone of doc and also allow for fast lateral transport of water and solutes to the stream due to typically higher porosities and generally higher hydraulic conductivities in these uppermost layers this transport process is triggered by rising riparian groundwater levels which increasingly intersect the upper highly conductive soil layers transmissivity feedback bishop et al 2004 whereas low groundwater levels result in a disconnected doc pool in consequence doc concentration increases progressively with increasing discharge levels this is in line with the model based finding that near stream sources with a short solute travel time to the stream lead to elevated concentration variability and steeper c q slopes musolff et al 2017a the analyses presented here indicate some predictive power of hydro chemistry variables on the relative doc variability iqrm however predictive power is low and the ranking of variables in the pls analysis varies when switching between considering all the variables or the hydro chemistry alone here collinearities between hydro chemistry and other catchment characteristics may play a role a high iqrm is connected to low so4 mg and ca and to high srp and ph at the moment we cannot fully resolve all these patterns however we argue that the dominance of riparian zones in wetter catchments high twi 0 9p high ai may cause a more significant dilution of so4 mg and ca derived from geogenic sources and deeper groundwater components see also erlandsson et al 2016 and musolff et al 2015 and is also responsible for a more pronounced mobilization of srp under iron reducing conditions dupas et al 2015 dupas et al 2018 musolff et al 2017b musolff et al 2017c although the analysis of long term doc concentration trends was not the main focus of this study we note that catchments exhibiting high concentration variability are also catchments with a strong long term increase of doc concentrations see fig 4d as also noted in our previous study musolff et al 2017c this result indicates that upward concentration trends are most severe in catchments with pronounced riparian zones notably this result differs from the findings of winterdahl et al 2016 who noticed that long term doc increases were largest in peat dominated acidic catchments with a pronounced temperature dependent doc variability this catchment type with a clear dominance of thick organic soil layers is not present in our data set the results from the analyses of our data set however provide an explanatory approach for long term changes in doc mobilization from riparian wetland soils in catchments in a temperate humid climate musolff et al 2017b musolff et al 2017c the low correlation factors of doc concentrations with water temperature and discharge presented here indicate a low predictive power of these variables we argue that controls of temperature and discharge are likely too complex to be captured by fixed regression model coefficients notably both temperature and discharge can have lagged and non stationary effects on instant doc concentration in the stream köhler et al 2009 seibert et al 2009 winterdahl et al 2011 this may be especially pronounced for the heterogeneous land use and geology patterns of central european catchments presented here although we cannot fully pinpoint the controls of discharge and temperature on doc concentrations our data driven analysis suggests that we can predict the concentration variability predictability of iqr and iqrm tab 2 based on a few metrics which define catchment characteristics 4 3 comparison to other studies our findings show that in addition to topographic indices as the major controlling factor climatic conditions such as aridity and mean annual temperature also influences average doc concentrations and doc variability here we use these climatic conditions to embed our results into the context of other studies linking doc concentrations and concentration variability to catchment characteristics fig 5 in comparison to other studies on the linkage of doc concentrations and catchment characteristics de wit et al 2016 dick et al 2015 laudon et al 2011 laudon et al 2012 monteith et al 2015 winterdahl et al 2014 our catchment dataset represents a drier and warmer climate that has not been covered before see fig 5a b there is an overlap of hydroclimatic conditions between the german catchments and southern sweden but no overlap with wet uk climates overall we can significantly extend the existing knowledge on catchment controls of doc concentrations to a broader range of hydroclimatic conditions in fig 5 we display our results in relation to four other studies in which information on etp p mat and catchment location was available for other studies in which this information was not fully available we note that there is overlap in terms of mat and p between the catchments presented in laudon et al 2012 from sweden scotland canada and the usa with the catchments presented in monteith et al 2015 and in winterdahl et al 2014 data from catchments in norway sweden and finland presented in de wit et al 2016 largely overlap in climatic conditions with the catchments given in winterdahl et al 2014 except for the coastal areas of norway with oceanic climate a certain sensitivity of average doc concentration and doc concentration variability to climatic characteristics also implies an impact of climate change in central european catchments as presented here climate projections indicate a robust trend of increasing temperature and evapotranspiration but only minor changes in precipitation resulting in a small downward trend of discharge marx et al 2018 thober et al 2018 trading the spatial differences of the studied catchments for time we note a potential small decrease of concentration variability however this approach is limited as a 2 k temperature increase is already larger than the interquartile range of mean temperature across our catchments note that in contrast to central europe precipitation and discharge are projected to show a considerable increase in northern europe marx et al 2018 thober et al 2018 with stronger consequences on the doc concentrations and exports de wit et al 2016 winterdahl et al 2016 5 conclusions in this study we assessed doc concentration and concentration variability in 89 catchments which drain into german drinking water reservoirs the analysis of the large sample data base indicate that the median doc concentration and the concentration variability in the studied catchments can be explained and predicted by a surprisingly low number of catchment characteristics differences in the median doc concentrations among the catchments are well explained by variability in the topographic wetness index twi 0 9p we argue that the twi 0 9p encodes differences in the occurrence of riparian wetlands as the dominant doc source zone for doc in the stream catchment topography with a high twi 0 9p together with a high overall wetness high ai low etp also promotes high doc concentration variability and strong positive correlations with discharge from catchment characteristics we can predict if a catchment is likely to exhibit high concentration variability however synoptic water temperature and discharge data as predictors cannot sufficiently capture measured doc concentration time series in individual catchments based on a parsimonious data driven model we attribute this to the fact that the instream concentration of doc at any given time is the result of several processes which operate over a range of time scales modelling doc concentrations in individual catchments can be tackled by more process based approaches birkel et al 2014 dick et al 2015 furthermore our data set is based on low frequency monitoring which limits the ability to evaluate short term concentration variability and hysteretic concentration discharge patterns disentangling shorter term dynamics and controls may be possible using an analysis of temporally higher resolved doc concentration measurements e g blaen et al 2017 from a practitioner s and catchment manager s point of view our results could provide a tool for a first order evaluation of the expected doc concentration and concentration variability in a given ungauged catchment quantifying doc concentration variability is valuable for water treatment as strong changes in concentration over time may require the rapid adjustment of doc removal or other measures eikebrokk et al 2004 köhler et al 2016 based on our data driven model that mainly used readily available data on catchment and climatic characteristics it is possible to obtain a first hand estimate of doc concentration and concentration variability for catchments with climatic conditions similar to those in the 89 studied catchments fig 5 the strong dominance of topography and climate on the doc concentration and concentration variability indicate that management options to reduce concentration levels and variability such as land use changes are limited based on hydroclimatic conditions aridity index and mean annual temperature we are able to embed our findings on doc

6937,elevated concentration and high variance of dissolved organic carbon doc in surface waters are a challenge for the production of drinking water past studies have indicated a dominant role of wetlands in doc mobilization but have mainly been focused on boreal and oceanic catchments here we analyze the observational doc time series from 89 temperate humid catchments which drain into german drinking water reservoirs we characterize the doc concentration median and variability and utilize partial least squares regression in order to quantify the relation to catchment characteristics such as land use climate and topography we found that the long term median doc concentration in the catchment is well predicted by the 90th percentile of the distribution of the topographic wetness index 0 9p twi over the entire catchment area the 0 9p twi can be directly connected to the abundance of riparian wetlands in the catchments doc concentration variability represented as the ratio of the interquartile range and the median concentrations was also found to be well predictable concentration variability was highest in cold and wet catchments with a high 0 9p twi here we also found stronger correlations between doc concentrations and discharge with positive concentration discharge patterns catchments with elevated doc concentration variance also exhibited the most severe long term increases in concentrations our results thus indicate that in temperate climates riparian wetlands can be the dominant source zones of doc and control the hydrological mobilization and potentially also the spatial difference in long term concentration trends observed in surface waters we conclude that the dominance of topography and climatic conditions in controlling spatio temporal patterns in doc concentrations leads to very limited management options keywords catchment carbon cycle riparian zone time series analysis mobilization 1 introduction dissolved organic carbon doc in surface waters plays an important role in the global carbon cycle battin et al 2009 cole et al 2007 and serves as a vital fuel for aquatic ecosystems solomon et al 2015 tank et al 2010 increasing concentrations of doc in many surface water systems across the northern hemisphere over the last decades monteith et al 2015 musolff et al 2017c worrall and burt 2007 have raised the awareness of researchers and practitioners high concentrations of doc put pressure on drinking water resources via the potential formation of disinfection byproducts sadiq and rodriguez 2004 as well as through negative effects on the biological stability park et al 2016 and filter run times eikebrokk et al 2004 in water treatment facilities doc is mostly mobilized from soils at the interface between terrestrial and aquatic systems laudon et al 2011 ledesma et al 2017 and exported towards downstream water resources e g drinking water reservoirs from the practitioners point of view questions arise as to what extent the doc concentration levels short term variability and long term trends are predictable and as to how their characteristics are influenced by catchment management activities thus a better understanding of doc source distribution and mobilization as well as of turnover processes their controls and the resulting short term and long term concentration variability is needed observational datasets utilizing routinely monitored doc at catchment outlets are commonly used for analyzing concentration and export variability over longer time spans clark et al 2010 however the spatial scale at which biogeochemical reactions and hydrological mobilization take place is much smaller than the scale integrated in observations at the catchment outlet nevertheless this kind of top down analysis allows for the determination of the problem s extent and for a deduction of dominant processes at the management scale in recent years a large number of observational studies with differing hypotheses on doc concentration dynamics have been proposed and published which makes it hard to conclusively answer the questions raised above clark et al 2010 often studies are dedicated to just one aspect of doc concentrations in surface water a controlling factors of long term monotonic trends in doc concentrations b controlling factors of average doc concentration levels or c controlling factors of inter and intra annual variability the different temporal scales of doc concentration variability long term average monotonic trend inter annual intra annual need to be carefully separated from each other when being assessed as they can mask each other clark et al 2010 temnerud et al 2014 moreover different catchments may exhibit a different sensitivity to the same controlling factor as a result of different landscape compositions clark et al 2010 erlandsson et al 2008 monteith et al 2015 consequently it is unlikely that there will be one unifying theory on the key factors which control doc concentration trends and variability which will be applicable to all catchments across the northern hemisphere clark et al 2010 however the literature has provided some key findings on important controls of doc concentrations in surface waters 1 average concentrations and fluxes can be related to the proportion of wetlands and peat soils in the catchment aitkenhead et al 1999 creed et al 2008 dillon and molot 1997 laudon et al 2004 monteith et al 2015 meaning that only a small fraction of the catchment is the dominant source zone of the doc observed in the stream over a wider hydro climatic range the relationship to wetlands is controlled by the mean annual temperature mat laudon et al 2012 weyhenmeyer and karlsson 2009 as it determines the potential of a catchment to produce remove and accumulate doc and to enable fluvial exports 2 there are two general hypotheses which can explain the long term trends of doc concentrations see review by clark et al 2010 and references therein trends are either related to climate change via temperature precipitation and discharge changes de wit et al 2016 freeman et al 2001 weyhenmeyer et al 2014 worrall and burt 2007 or to changes in atmospheric sulphur deposition de wit et al 2016 monteith et al 2007 or n deposition musolff et al 2017c 3 the intra annual variability of doc concentrations is typically much larger than the variability induced by long term trends and is mostly controlled by discharge and temperature variability hytteborn et al 2015 laudon et al 2011 seibert et al 2009 winterdahl et al 2014 winterdahl et al 2016 wetlands are seen as the dominant source zones of doc but not all wetlands are hydrologically connected to the stream in the same way surface waters draining from mires with peat soils are usually high in doc concentration laudon et al 2004 and laudon et al 2011 for example showed that boreal streams in peatland dominated catchments exhibit dilution patterns in doc concentrations with increasing discharge due to surficial flow paths bypassing the doc source zones the same was found by birkel et al 2017 in a german bog in contrast riparian wetlands are recognized as the dominant source zones that are only activated during high flow periods bishop et al 2004 dick et al 2015 laudon et al 2011 ledesma et al 2015 seibert et al 2009 here the temporal dynamics of the shallow groundwater table is the key factor which controls the doc release from riparian soils under low flow conditions with low groundwater levels lateral transport is generally suppressed by low hydraulic conductivity in deeper soil layers in contrast high groundwater levels can interfere with the shallow organic soil layers which have a higher hydraulic conductivity than deeper soil layers allowing for a fast lateral export of doc seibert et al 2009 winterdahl et al 2011 consequently doc concentrations increase with increasing discharge bishop et al 2004 musolff et al 2015 seibert et al 2009 strohmeier et al 2013 this process was shown to be dominant not only in boreal till soils but also in temperate forested catchments knorr 2013 strohmeier et al 2013 as well as in agriculturally used lands jeanneau et al 2015 note that in warmer climates such as the subhumid mediterranean the tight connection between the riparian zone and the surface water in headwater streams can be significantly altered by instream processing bernal et al 2018 ledesma et al 2015 showed the importance of local hydro morphology i e the width of the riparian zone in controlling the exported doc loads consequently morphological indices such as the mean topographic wetness index twi andersson and nyberg 2009 grabs et al 2012 ledesma et al 2015 the mean elevation above stream laudon et al 2012 the slope creed et al 2003 or results from more complex topographical analyses creed et al 2008 all based on digital elevation models dems can be used as proxies for delineating doc source zones methods based on dem analysis also account for cryptic wetlands which are covered by a closed canopy surface and therefore not visible in the normal land use analyses creed et al 2003 most of the observationally studies on doc are based on data from boreal and oceanic climates de wit et al 2016 laudon et al 2012 monteith et al 2007 tetzlaff et al 2013 winterdahl et al 2014 worrall and burt 2007 see also fig 5 there are surprising few studies which incorporated large catchment scale datasets of doc concentrations from humid continental climates musolff et al 2017c oulehle and hruska 2009 sucker et al 2011 elevated and long term increasing doc concentrations were found to also threaten drinking water reservoirs within humid continental germany musolff et al 2017c this study found strong evidence that increasing doc concentrations are linked to an increase in the reductive mobilization of iron iii minerals as a consequence of declining atmospheric nitrate input these processes were found to be most pronounced in catchments with low topographic gradients which are more prone to facilitate wetland soils as the potential doc source zone however according to montanarella et al 2006 germany is far less dominated by wetland soils 5 of total area than the uk 22 6 or sweden 24 9 moreover only a small fraction of these wetlands actually occurs in mountainous areas rosskopf et al 2015 where the problem of increasing doc concentrations in drinking water reservoirs is most pressing musolff et al 2017c this raises the question of whether and to what extent the source zones and mobilization mechanisms in these central european catchments are comparable to those in more northern latitudes although previous studies as mentioned above have provided many different sometimes conflicting explanations for the instream doc concentration magnitude and variability of instream doc concentrations there is growing evidence that general patterns and dynamics are encoded in a manageable number of key characteristics of the catchment and its geo and hydrochemical inventory following this idea the main objective of our work is to explain differences in doc concentrations in catchment outflows across a set of humid german catchments more specifically the aim is to characterize average doc concentrations as well as intra annual doc concentration variability we quantify and discuss their connections to and predictability based on generic catchment characteristics such as topography climate and land use finally we elaborate on the ramifications for doc concentration management at the catchment scale we use a large data set of hydrochemical variables and data on catchment characteristics from a set of 89 catchments which drain into drinking water reservoirs in germany rather than trying to explain the dynamics in one or a few specific catchments we utilize this large sample data base to identify general patterns and key explanatory factors controlling the doc concentration behaviors across temperature humid catchments 2 materials and methods 2 1 data base we compiled water chemical and catchment data from 89 catchments draining into 35 german drinking water reservoirs the catchments are distributed throughout germany whereby the selection focuses on low mountain ranges where surface water is the major source for drinking water production fig 1 here land management activities are restricted to ensure high water quality this includes the ban of manure as fertilizer the use of buffer strips and crop rotation aiming at low nutrient surplus we selected catchments that do not contain lakes or reservoirs with a surface area of more than 0 01 km2 within a distance of 5 km upstream from the sampling point in total about 16 000 samples collected between 1993 and 2013 were considered with an average of 180 samples per catchment and 11 samples per year this data is part of an extended data base containing 110 catchments which has been used by musolff et al 2017c for analyzing long term concentration trends of doc dissolved iron phosphate and nitrate as the focus in this study was on analyzing intra annual variability in concentration the dataset was reduced from 110 to 89 catchments considering only catchments which had a mean sampling frequency of more than seven samples per year with at least seven years of valid data samples were taken as grab samples and analyzed following a standard protocol wasserchemische gesellschaft 2014 doc was measured after filtration through a 0 7 µm glass fiber filter dissolved iron fed and soluble reactive phosphorous srp are defined as the fraction passing a 0 45 µm filter specific uv absorbance suva refers to the specific absorbance at 254 nm normalized for the doc concentration other water quality parameters which were taken into consideration included ph and the concentrations of nitrate no3 sulfate so4 magnesium mg and calcium ca the daily total precipitation measurements taken at the reservoir dam were available for all catchments over the entire observation period the values were aggregated to calculate the long term mean annual sums for each catchment discharge measurements at the time and place of sampling were available for 20 of the study catchments we used gis analysis esri arcgis and saga to delineate the catchment areas based on fine resolution 10 m dem data and to derive the mean elevation and slope estimates the probability distribution of the topographic wetness index twi is used to characterize the potential for soil wetness and size of riparian wetlands the twi ln a tanβ introduced by beven and kirkby 1979 relates the upslope area of each dem cell a to the local slope β a visualization of the twi along a hillslope can be found in fig 2 we performed a monte carlo assessment to derive the twi in different virtual hillslope settings in order to better evaluate which characteristic of the twi probability distribution e g mean median quantiles best represents the extent of riparian wetlands details can be found in the supporting information information on land usage proportions was derived using the german topographical information system atkis mean annual temperature mat as well as potential evapotranspiration etp and the aridity index ai given as the ratio of mean annual precipitation and mean annual etp was derived from a germany wide data set available at a spatial resolution of 4 km 4 km zink et al 2017 the long term mean annual climatic characteristics mat ai correspond to the time period 1950 2013 in order to compare our data with those of other data driven studies on doc within europe we used the gridded products of daily precipitation and temperature data from the e obs v14 0 haylock et al 2008 provided by the european climate assessment and datasets eca d project the e obs dataset is available at around 25 km spatial resolution and the climate characteristics estimated correspond to the period 1950 2015 the potential evapotranspiration for both german and e obs datasets was calculated using the hargreaves and samani method hargreaves and samani 1982 2 2 statistical methods solute concentrations in the surface water are typically lognormally distributed jawitz and mitchell 2011 we used the median and the ratio of interquartile range iqr 0 75 percentile 0 25 percentile and median to characterize average concentrations and concentration variability this relative concentration variability iqrm in the following is a robust measure of variability the form of which is analogous to the coefficient of variation with the advantage that its interpretation does not require the underlying data to follow a specific distribution recently winterdahl et al 2014 used a similar measure ratio of range to median here we refer to iqrm as it is not as sensitive to outlying extreme concentrations as range statistics are concentrations often systematically change with discharge amount and with season hirsch et al 2010 temnerud et al 2014 the relation of concentrations to discharge can be used to classify solute export and to identify dominant mobilization processes at catchment scale godsey et al 2009 jawitz and mitchell 2011 musolff et al 2017a musolff et al 2015 here we use the slope b and pearson s correlation coefficient rq of the linear regression of the logarithm of concentration and the logarithm of discharge observations musolff et al 2017a the seasonality of doc concentration is quantified by rt based on the linear regression of the logarithm of concentration with water temperature both rq and rt are based on detrended doc concentration time series assuming a long term linear trend note that rq and rt are also used by winterdahl et al 2014 but as spearman s rank correlation coefficient here we refer to pearson s correlation coefficient to be consistent with the doc concentration variance explained by the linear regression with these two factors also note that potential shifts in the seasonality over the years e g systematic warmer or wetter springs are better captured by this approach as it does not rely on day of the year or month as a predictor spearman s rank correlation analysis is used to characterize bivariate relations of median doc concentrations as well as concentration variability iqr iqrm with other variables partial least squares regression pls wold et al 2001 is used to quantify the predictive power of catchment characteristics to median doc concentrations and iqrm the pls analysis is suitable for these kind of data driven analyses wherein different catchment characteristics predictors often exhibit collinearities musolff et al 2015 onderka et al 2012 for instance the share of agricultural land use is typically correlated to metrics of topography a fact which hampers a sound regression analysis carrascal et al 2009 pls is able to handle these collinearities by constructing latent variables from predictors and response wold et al 2001 the results are interpreted by making use of the variable influence on projection vip and by the regression coefficient while the vip determines the most influential predictors vip 1 is considered to be most relevant the regression coefficient indicates the direction of the relationship we used the package pls in the r environment with the nipals nonlinear iterative partial least squares algorithm the mean squared error of prediction was used to choose the optimal number of underlying components mevik and cederkvist 2004 details can also be found in musolff et al 2015 we also performed one way analysis of variance anova to test if groups of variables have significantly different means the statistical significance of the differences is evaluated at 5 significance level i e p value 0 05 in cases of diverging variance we applied the welch correction zimmerman 2004 3 results 3 1 catchment characteristics the catchments span a wide range of topography and land use characteristics as well as climatic conditions tab 1 however since all catchments drain into drinking water reservoirs our dataset is slightly biased to first order catchments lying in low mountain ranges with a relatively high fraction of forest cover based on the land use classification only one of the 89 catchments incorporates wetlands defined here as peatland and swamp areas of more than 1 ha in size notably this analysis does not account for cryptic wetlands under the canopy and narrow riparian wetlands along the streams although forests dominate most catchments water quality conditions cannot be described as pristine the climate is humid with annual potential evapotranspiration etp near or below the annual precipitation p since etp is less variable than p the resulting aridity index ai is mainly controlled by p the mean annual air temperature is mainly related to the altitude fig s1 the mean annual discharge q ranges between 15 and 76 median 32 of p agricultural and urban land use as well as atmospheric deposition of n species alewell et al 2001 sucker et al 2011 led to elevated concentrations of no3 and srp 3 2 median doc concentration median doc concentrations in the studied catchments span an order of magnitude from below 1 mg l to above 10 mg l table 1 the correlation analysis fig s1 reveals strongest correlations of median doc concentration with the 90th percentile of the topographic wetness index twi 0 9p with a spearman s rank correlation coefficient rs of 0 76 and a negative correlation with the mean slope in the catchment rs 0 63 land use variables and hydro climate parameters are only weakly correlated to the median doc concentrations rs 0 5 the correlation analysis with hydro chemical variables reveals a co occurrence of doc with fed rs 0 59 but only a weaker correlation to all other parameters rs 0 5 the correlation analysis also shows the expected strong collinearities among the group of land use variables e g arable land vs forest cover rs 0 88 hydro climate variable e g discharge vs precipitation rs 0 96 and hydro chemistry variables e g ca vs mg rs 0 82 we utilize partial least squares regression pls to predict median doc and to systematically analyze the contribution of all possible groups of predictors land use and topography hydro climate and hydro chemistry we excluded discharge from the hydro climatic predictors at this point due to the limited availability of discharge measurements at the sampling locations moreover we also excluded dissolved iron fed from the main pls analysis for all 89 catchments for the same reason however since relationship between doc and fed has already been discussed in terms of long term trends for the same set of catchments musolff et al 2017c we added a pls analysis including fed for 62 catchments to the supporting information as well as a short discussion further below the pls model explains 76 of the variance in median doc concentrations in the catchments taking all predictors into account table 2 according to the vip ranking catchment topography in terms of the twi 0 9p and the mean slope appear to be the most important predictors while climate characteristics p and mat and altitude are less important this is reflected in the pls analysis when taking groups of predictors into account tables s2 s4 the hydro chemical r2 0 29 table s2 and hydro climatic variables r2 0 31 table s3 alone cannot sufficiently explain the spatial differences in median doc concentrations while the group of topography and land use variables jointly explains 64 of the variance table s4 a simple power law model of the median doc as a function of twi 0 9p explains 60 of the variance fig 3 including measurements of fed into the pls analysis and reducing the number of catchments to 62 increases explained variance by 4 when all predictors are taken into account table s5 here fed is of similar importance as twi 0 9p adding fed to the group of hydro chemical variables increases the explained variance to 62 with fed and srp as the most important predictors of median doc concentrations table s6 3 3 doc concentration variability the iqr as a measure of doc concentration variability varies significantly among the catchments 0 3 mg l to 12 2 mg l table 3 moreover the iqr is positively correlated with the median concentration rs 0 87 catchments with a high median concentration also exhibit a high concentration variability a linear model of iqr as a function of median doc concentration reveals a slope of 0 69 r2 0 72 p 0 01 when the median doc concentration increases by 1 mg l across the catchments iqr increases by 0 69 mg l the size of this slope refers to 50 2 of the median doc concentration of all catchments this iqr increase with increasing median concentration was found to be much stronger for doc than for other substances such as so4 1 1 r2 0 71 or ca 1 8 r2 0 74 due to the strong scaling of iqr of doc concentrations with the median concentrations we put greater emphasis on the analysis of iqrm the ratio of the iqr and the median table 3 iqrm varies considerably between the catchments spanning one order of magnitude we utilize metrics that give insight into potential controls of doc concentration variability pearson s correlation coefficient between doc concentrations and water temperature rt as well as discharge rq using lncdoc and lnq in general rt is more often positive than negative 17 out of 89 catchments in contrast rq is positive in only half of the studied catchments which had discharge measurements available 10 out of 20 catchments the absolute value of rq appears stronger for the positive correlation median 0 09 than for the negative correlation median 0 03 the rank correlation analysis fig s2 reveals few significant correlations of the iqr and the relative iqrm of doc concentration to both the catchment characteristics and the hydro chemical variables for the iqr strong rank correlation with rs greater than 0 6 can be found with median doc concentration 0 87 with twi 0 9p 0 74 and with fed 0 67 for iqrm the aridity index 0 60 showed strongest rank correlation in contrast other metrics rt rq and slope b exhibit significant and strong rank correlations in only a few cases there is however a strong correlation among the metrics rt vs rq 0 77 rt vs slope b 0 77 rq vs slope b 0 99 these relations indicate that there is a continuum between catchments with a stronger correlation between doc concentration and water temperature on the one hand and catchments with a stronger correlation between doc concentrations and discharge fig s3a as well as steeper c q slopes on the other hand fig s3b all other correlations although significant are less than 0 6 rt is related to fed and etp rq and slope b to etp note that there is no significant rank correlation of rt and rq with iqrm but a significant pearson s correlation between rq and iqrm rpears 0 62 p 0 01 exists i e catchments with a strong correlation between discharge and doc concentrations also exhibit high relative concentration variability the relationships between iqrm and rt rq and slope b are visualized in fig 4 a c catchments with a low relative doc concentration variability iqrm 0 5 exhibit comparable absolute correlation factors to discharge and water temperature median absolute rt 0 12 rq 0 09 however elevated relative doc concentration variability iqrm 0 5 goes along with a stronger correlation with discharge but not with temperature median absolute rt 0 15 rq 0 40 according to the anova test results the differences between the two groups of catchments with high and low doc variability are significant for rq p 0 05 but not for rt p 0 05 it is worth noting that there are distinct differences in the occurrence of significant monotonic long term trends in doc concentrations among the studied catchments fig 4d catchments with lower relative concentration variability iqrm 0 5 n 55 are characterized by both negative n 20 and positive concentration trends n 12 with an overall median slope of 0 019 mg l a in contrast catchments with higher concentration variability iqrm 0 5 n 34 only show positive trends n 23 with an overall median slope of 0 112 mg l a both groups are significantly different from each other p 0 05 consequently the most severe positive concentration trends in terms of absolute changes occur in catchments with elevated relative concentration variability this is also expressed in a positive correlation between absolute significant concentration trends and iqrm rs 0 58 p 0 01 fig 4d as well as relative significant trends normalized by median doc concentrations and iqrm rs 0 52 p 0 01 the pls analysis reveals that the relative concentration variability iqrm of the individual catchments is generally predictable from catchment characteristics table 4 r2 0 63 such as topography twi 0 9p hydroclimate ai and hydro chemical variables srp ph so4 mg ca this indicates that catchments with a high iqrm are characterized by a higher topographic wetness index and wetter climatic conditions high annual precipitation and high ai on the one hand and lower so4 and ca and high srp and ph on the other hand taking only the seven most important predictors into account listed in table 4 the model explains 50 of the variance of iqrm topography land use and climate alone can predict 50 of the variance of iqrm table s8 whereas hydro chemical variables alone can explain only 41 table s9 including fed into the pls analysis slightly increases the predictability of iqrm from r2 0 63 to 0 71 table s10 vip values indicate that fed is an important albeit not the most important predictor the coefficient indicates that a high iqrm goes along with elevated fed concentrations 4 discussion 4 1 controls of median doc concentrations the doc concentrations in the studied temperate humid german catchments median value of 2 98 mg l are comparable to concentrations reported for catchments in the uk monteith et al 2015 median 4 1 mg l and france moatar et al 2017 median 4 45 mg l but much lower than the results given by winterdahl et al 2014 from sweden median 9 5 mg l or by de wit et al 2016 from boreal sites in norway sweden and finland median boreal wet 8 1 mg l to boreal dry 10 5 mg l the pls analysis revealed that catchment topography is the dominant control of differences in the median doc concentration across the 89 studied catchments catchments with a high twi 0 9p and low slopes generally exhibited high doc concentrations the twi 0 9p predictor alone could explain 60 of the variance in median doc concentrations past studies have found the fractions of wetlands peatlands to be a major factor controlling average doc concentrations dick et al 2015 hytteborn et al 2015 monteith et al 2015 tiwari et al 2017 winterdahl et al 2014 however our study catchments from the german low mountain ranges do not exhibit widespread occurrence of wetlands based on soil and land use maps rosskopf et al 2015 our analysis suggests that riparian wetlands which are not encoded in land use maps but could be deduced from topographical maps are the dominant source zone for doc throughout the catchments notably previous literature has shown that the twi is connected to riparian wetlands in terms of depths to groundwater grabs et al 2012 ledesma et al 2015 soil moisture wilson et al 2004 soil wetness agren et al 2014 toc content of soil water grabs et al 2012 thickness of the organic soil layer seibert et al 2007 and riparian vegetation patterns shoutis et al 2010 these studies link the twi at a given point within the catchment to local measurements here we utilized the twi probability distribution of the entire catchment as the twi scales with the length of a hillslope accumulating upslope area the average twi may not be a good measure for effectively characterizing the width of the riparian zones within a catchment we systematically tested the predictive power of different metrics of the twi probability with regards to the width of the riparian zone by constructing virtual hillslopes with different properties length height width see si text and fig 2 s4 and s5 the 90th percentile of the twi distribution was found to be the best predictor of the width of the riparian zone for a hillslope tested against median 75th 95th percentile and areas with twi 8 we transferred this metric twi 0 9p to the catchment scale which generally performed better in the rank correlation analysis than other tested topography metrics see si text although we recognize that a more complex and detailed spatial analysis of the twi can be done for individual catchments e g mengistu et al 2014 this is not within the scope of this study moreover we note that the twi analysis incorporates hydrologically connected riparian as well as disconnected wetlands they cannot be considered to be independent of each other as a catchment with a low topographic gradient mean slope will have a high probability for high a twi and the occurrence of isolated and connected wetlands andersson and nyberg 2009 nevertheless our aim here is to present a simple yet powerful metric that can easily be derived from an available topographic dataset and can generally be used across a range of catchments we argue that the dem derived twi 0 9p which is typically more readily available than high resolution soil and land cover maps can be a suitable measure for the width of the riparian zone in catchments based on this metric our data driven analysis provides strong evidence that the riparian soils are the dominant source zone of doc in the studied catchments the presence of pronounced riparian wetlands promotes high concentrations of doc as it allows the accumulation of organic carbon in direct vicinity of the stream network which in turn can be quickly transferred to the stream in the form of doc bishop et al 2004 ledesma et al 2015 seibert et al 2009 in contrast the absence of riparian wetlands in steeper catchments does not allow for such a direct connectivity between pools of organic carbon in the catchment and the stream and therefore leads to an overall lower doc concentration level 4 2 controls of doc concentration variability our analysis shows that catchments with a high relative concentration variability iqrm of doc generally have a stronger positive correlation between concentration and discharge rq in contrast the correlation of concentrations to water temperature rt was found to be independent of iqrm this indicates that overall concentration variability was more controlled by short term discharge dynamics than by seasonal temperature related concentration changes our results show a negative relationship between rq and rt across german catchments that is comparable to the findings of winterdahl et al 2014 for catchments in southern sweden winterdahl et al 2014 hypothesized that this continuum between more flow driven or more temperature driven concentration dynamics across catchments can be explained by contrasting doc mobilization mechanisms in two general types of catchments in catchments with shallow organic soil horizons doc mobilization is dominated by discharge events that activate the shallow doc source layers high rq low rt whereas in catchments with thick organic peat soils doc sources does not change much during discharge events and concentration dynamics are dominated by temperature driven biological doc production high rt negative rq this hypothesis was then backed up by soil water profile data in a follow up study by winterdahl et al 2016 the correlation and pls analysis of catchment controlling factors presented here revealed that wet lower etp higher ai p and q and cold higher altitude lower mat catchments with wide riparian zones higher twi 0 9p exhibit an overall higher doc concentration variability iqrm with a stronger positive correlation between doc concentration and discharge as well as steeper c q slopes we argue here that the doc variability is dominated by carbon mobilized from riparian wetlands in these catchments at the same time riparian wetlands act as discharge generating zones and as the dominant source zones of doc birkel et al 2014 bishop et al 2004 dick et al 2015 ledesma et al 2015 musolff et al 2015 musolff et al 2017c seibert et al 2009 more specifically the shallow organic layers of the riparian soils are the main source zone of doc and also allow for fast lateral transport of water and solutes to the stream due to typically higher porosities and generally higher hydraulic conductivities in these uppermost layers this transport process is triggered by rising riparian groundwater levels which increasingly intersect the upper highly conductive soil layers transmissivity feedback bishop et al 2004 whereas low groundwater levels result in a disconnected doc pool in consequence doc concentration increases progressively with increasing discharge levels this is in line with the model based finding that near stream sources with a short solute travel time to the stream lead to elevated concentration variability and steeper c q slopes musolff et al 2017a the analyses presented here indicate some predictive power of hydro chemistry variables on the relative doc variability iqrm however predictive power is low and the ranking of variables in the pls analysis varies when switching between considering all the variables or the hydro chemistry alone here collinearities between hydro chemistry and other catchment characteristics may play a role a high iqrm is connected to low so4 mg and ca and to high srp and ph at the moment we cannot fully resolve all these patterns however we argue that the dominance of riparian zones in wetter catchments high twi 0 9p high ai may cause a more significant dilution of so4 mg and ca derived from geogenic sources and deeper groundwater components see also erlandsson et al 2016 and musolff et al 2015 and is also responsible for a more pronounced mobilization of srp under iron reducing conditions dupas et al 2015 dupas et al 2018 musolff et al 2017b musolff et al 2017c although the analysis of long term doc concentration trends was not the main focus of this study we note that catchments exhibiting high concentration variability are also catchments with a strong long term increase of doc concentrations see fig 4d as also noted in our previous study musolff et al 2017c this result indicates that upward concentration trends are most severe in catchments with pronounced riparian zones notably this result differs from the findings of winterdahl et al 2016 who noticed that long term doc increases were largest in peat dominated acidic catchments with a pronounced temperature dependent doc variability this catchment type with a clear dominance of thick organic soil layers is not present in our data set the results from the analyses of our data set however provide an explanatory approach for long term changes in doc mobilization from riparian wetland soils in catchments in a temperate humid climate musolff et al 2017b musolff et al 2017c the low correlation factors of doc concentrations with water temperature and discharge presented here indicate a low predictive power of these variables we argue that controls of temperature and discharge are likely too complex to be captured by fixed regression model coefficients notably both temperature and discharge can have lagged and non stationary effects on instant doc concentration in the stream köhler et al 2009 seibert et al 2009 winterdahl et al 2011 this may be especially pronounced for the heterogeneous land use and geology patterns of central european catchments presented here although we cannot fully pinpoint the controls of discharge and temperature on doc concentrations our data driven analysis suggests that we can predict the concentration variability predictability of iqr and iqrm tab 2 based on a few metrics which define catchment characteristics 4 3 comparison to other studies our findings show that in addition to topographic indices as the major controlling factor climatic conditions such as aridity and mean annual temperature also influences average doc concentrations and doc variability here we use these climatic conditions to embed our results into the context of other studies linking doc concentrations and concentration variability to catchment characteristics fig 5 in comparison to other studies on the linkage of doc concentrations and catchment characteristics de wit et al 2016 dick et al 2015 laudon et al 2011 laudon et al 2012 monteith et al 2015 winterdahl et al 2014 our catchment dataset represents a drier and warmer climate that has not been covered before see fig 5a b there is an overlap of hydroclimatic conditions between the german catchments and southern sweden but no overlap with wet uk climates overall we can significantly extend the existing knowledge on catchment controls of doc concentrations to a broader range of hydroclimatic conditions in fig 5 we display our results in relation to four other studies in which information on etp p mat and catchment location was available for other studies in which this information was not fully available we note that there is overlap in terms of mat and p between the catchments presented in laudon et al 2012 from sweden scotland canada and the usa with the catchments presented in monteith et al 2015 and in winterdahl et al 2014 data from catchments in norway sweden and finland presented in de wit et al 2016 largely overlap in climatic conditions with the catchments given in winterdahl et al 2014 except for the coastal areas of norway with oceanic climate a certain sensitivity of average doc concentration and doc concentration variability to climatic characteristics also implies an impact of climate change in central european catchments as presented here climate projections indicate a robust trend of increasing temperature and evapotranspiration but only minor changes in precipitation resulting in a small downward trend of discharge marx et al 2018 thober et al 2018 trading the spatial differences of the studied catchments for time we note a potential small decrease of concentration variability however this approach is limited as a 2 k temperature increase is already larger than the interquartile range of mean temperature across our catchments note that in contrast to central europe precipitation and discharge are projected to show a considerable increase in northern europe marx et al 2018 thober et al 2018 with stronger consequences on the doc concentrations and exports de wit et al 2016 winterdahl et al 2016 5 conclusions in this study we assessed doc concentration and concentration variability in 89 catchments which drain into german drinking water reservoirs the analysis of the large sample data base indicate that the median doc concentration and the concentration variability in the studied catchments can be explained and predicted by a surprisingly low number of catchment characteristics differences in the median doc concentrations among the catchments are well explained by variability in the topographic wetness index twi 0 9p we argue that the twi 0 9p encodes differences in the occurrence of riparian wetlands as the dominant doc source zone for doc in the stream catchment topography with a high twi 0 9p together with a high overall wetness high ai low etp also promotes high doc concentration variability and strong positive correlations with discharge from catchment characteristics we can predict if a catchment is likely to exhibit high concentration variability however synoptic water temperature and discharge data as predictors cannot sufficiently capture measured doc concentration time series in individual catchments based on a parsimonious data driven model we attribute this to the fact that the instream concentration of doc at any given time is the result of several processes which operate over a range of time scales modelling doc concentrations in individual catchments can be tackled by more process based approaches birkel et al 2014 dick et al 2015 furthermore our data set is based on low frequency monitoring which limits the ability to evaluate short term concentration variability and hysteretic concentration discharge patterns disentangling shorter term dynamics and controls may be possible using an analysis of temporally higher resolved doc concentration measurements e g blaen et al 2017 from a practitioner s and catchment manager s point of view our results could provide a tool for a first order evaluation of the expected doc concentration and concentration variability in a given ungauged catchment quantifying doc concentration variability is valuable for water treatment as strong changes in concentration over time may require the rapid adjustment of doc removal or other measures eikebrokk et al 2004 köhler et al 2016 based on our data driven model that mainly used readily available data on catchment and climatic characteristics it is possible to obtain a first hand estimate of doc concentration and concentration variability for catchments with climatic conditions similar to those in the 89 studied catchments fig 5 the strong dominance of topography and climate on the doc concentration and concentration variability indicate that management options to reduce concentration levels and variability such as land use changes are limited based on hydroclimatic conditions aridity index and mean annual temperature we are able to embed our findings on doc

6938,characterizing the hydraulic conductivity distribution in aquifers is fundamental for groundwater models solute transport and hyporheic exchange based on a total of 13 397 borehole packer test data collected at 12 high dam sites in southwest china the statistical distribution of hydraulic conductivity of rocks in this deep incised valley area was investigated using hypothesis test regression analysis and semi variogram analysis showing that the hydraulic conductivity of igneous and metamorphic rocks at various depths in the study area follows a log normal distribution within 600 m depth the vertical variation in hydraulic conductivity k m s and standard deviation of lgk with depth d m can be best described by the power function k 2 10 6 d 0 48 and the logistic function σ lg k 0 6 1 d 428 4 7 it is deduced that the decreasing degree of weathering and unloading from ground surface to unaltered fresh rocks leads to reduction in the geometric mean of hydraulic conductivity by about 1 2 orders of magnitude the hydraulic conductivity of rocks in the study area is more controlled by geologic structures of various origins and scales and less by lithology the

distributions are suitable for low permeability fine grained porous media such as silt and silty clay and the bimodal distribution is usually applied to heterogeneous porous media such as sand silt and clay mixtures where the permeability of each constituent differs greatly the log normal distribution is most widely used which is suitable for both homogeneous and heterogeneous media including crystalline rocks but more appropriate for coarse grained porous media like sand and gravel over the last two decades a considerable number of high dams have been built in southwest china for water

bedrocks loose deposits of different formation mechanisms are present on the streambeds and locally distributed on gentle hillslopes zhou et al 2015 wang et al 2016 but they are not a topic of this study the study area lies in the subtropical monsoon climate zone where over 80 of the annual precipitation occurs from may to october groundwater in the study area is principally recharged by precipitation and snowmelt and discharged to streams and rivers the infiltrated water migrates and its water table in the valleys is controlled by the fault systems and fracture networks the depth of water table changes from site to site with its gradient varying from very gentle about 1 4 e g xiluodu xld site and the left bank of jinping i jp i site chen et al 2016 to much steeper close to the gradient of valley slopes e g kala kl site li et al 2014 2 2 packer tests during site characterizations of these hydropower projects table 1 lugeon borehole tests were performed to examine the permeability of the foundation rocks and for the design of impervious barriers this technique has been long and widely applied in dam and civil engineering lugeon 1933 snow 1968 louis and maini 1970 houlsby 1976 price et al 1977 bliss and rushton 1984 brassington and walthall 1985 mollah and sayed 1995 neuman 2005 both in saturated zones and in vadose zones other techniques such as pumping test theis 1935 batu 1998 and slug test lu et al 1999 quinn et al 2013 were rarely conducted which allows for data calibration but not for statistical analysis the lugeon tests performed at these sites strictly followed industrial standards after borehole drilling and flushing water was injected at constant pressure into each packer isolated section of the boreholes the injection pressure was stepwise increased from p 1 0 3 mpa to p 2 0 6 mpa and to p 3 1 0 mpa when the steady state condition had been reached for each injection step i e after five or more readings of flow rate at 1 2 min intervals were equal which was followed by a stepwise release of the injection pressure the radius r w of the test boreholes was 38 mm and the length l of the test sections varied between 3 7 and 6 4 m this study collected a total of 13 397 lugeon test data performed in 614 boreholes drilled vertically from ground surfaces or exploratory tunnels at different elevations at the aforementioned 12 dam sites see table 1 for the number of tests at each site the deepest test sections were located at about 593 m below the ground surface here an example is given for the left bank half of a typical geological cross section at the jp i dam site fig 2 where the geologic features and the layout of the exploratory tunnels and boreholes are plotted chen et al 2016 these data are believed to be representative of the permeability of bedrocks in the deep incised valleys in southwest china 2 3 data interpretation and analysis as commonly done in the literature the packer test data was interpreted with two quantities in this study i e lugeon value q for characterizing the intactness and groutability of rocks and hydraulic conductivity k for representing the permeability of the tested rocks the lugeon value q lu is calculated by q q lp typically at the last injection pressure step i e p 1 mpa where q l min is the injected flow rate under the steady state condition l m is the length of test section and p mpa is the injection pressure the calculation of hydraulic conductivity k m s from the packer test data relies on a proper choice of darcy s law based interpretive models

adopted using the steady state data at the last injection pressure step i e p 1 mpa 1 k q 2 π h l ln l 2 r w 1 l 2 r w 2 where k m s is the hydraulic conductivity q m3 s is the volumetric flow rate under the steady state condition h m is the pressure head at the last injection step and r w m is the borehole radius here it is to be noted that the anisotropy of aquifers was not considered in this study due to lack of independent measurements for the anisotropic ratio of horizontal to vertical hydraulic conductivity needed for interpretation e g hvorslev 1951 zlotnik 1994 the variation of k with depth was evaluated with its geometric mean at every 10 m interval warren and price 1961 desbarats 1987 durlofsky 1991 hinrichsen et al 1993 the geometric mean values of k in the zones of different degree of weathering and unloading were also calculated see table 2 for the criteria for weathering and unloading zonation in the study area the spatial variability of k was evaluated by the experimental variogram using the classical estimator matheron 1963 without the removal of outliers which reads 2 γ h 1 2 n h i 1 n h z x i z x i h 2 where γ h is the semi variogram n h is the number of experimental pairs separated by distance h m z xi m s is the measured value at location xi and z xi h m s is the value at a distance h from xi the semi variogram was calculated in the vertical direction due to the limited test locations in the horizontal direction given the conductivity depth trend in this study see section 3 2 we calculated the semi variogram with conductivities de trended by the k d relationship see eq 4 at each site following the approach by volpi and gambolati 1978 and dingman et al 1988 furthermore the exponential variogram model isaaks and srivastava 1989 was used to fit the experimental semi variogram 3 γ h n c 1 exp 3 h λ where n is a parameter for the nugget effect n 0 in this study c is the sill and λ m is the correlation length 3 results 3 1 variability of rock s hydraulic conductivity the obtained hydraulic conductivity measurements from all the test sites vary within four orders of magnitude between 1 3 10 9 m s and 2 6 10 5 m s with a geometric mean of 2 2 10 7 m s and a standard deviation σ lg k of 0 57 for the log transformed k data lgk the geometric mean k value of the measurements collected at each test site varies in the range of 1 8 10 7 m s and the σ lg k value varies between 0 38 and 0 70 table 3 the histogram of the k values from all the test sites after a logarithmic transformation shows that the lgk values roughly follow a normal distribution fig 3 to verify this hypothesis both the normal quantile plot rehfeldt et al 1992 ryan and boufadel 2007 cheng et al 2011 and the mann whitney u test siddiqui and parizek 1971 were applied in this study the normal quantile plot of the measured lgk data versus a normal distribution fig 4 displays an equal line with a high coefficient of determination r2 0 97 this confirms that the lgk data is normally distributed i e the k values follow a log normal distribution which is additionally underpinned by the mann whitney u test the 95 confidence interval for lgk fig 3 indicates that the hydraulic conductivity of the fractured aquifers in the study area varies mostly within two orders of magnitude between 1 7 10 8 m s and 2 9 10 6 m s the distribution of the k values at every 20 m interval of depth was also examined by the hypothesis test fig s1 in supplementary material the results show that the k values again follow the log normal distribution for different depths within 600 m from ground surface it should be noted that with further increase of depth there is a progressive change from fracture dominated flow to matrix dominated flow which may result in a changing distribution of data achtziger zupančič et al 2017a b furthermore the histograms of the k data at each site and their hypothesis tests fig s2 in supplementary material show that the log normal distribution could also approximately describe the distribution of k at each site with r2 0 90 3 2 vertical distributions of rock s hydraulic conductivity it has been well understood that with the increase of depth from ground surface the rock is less disturbed and hence is reduced the hydraulic conductivity as a function of lower fracture density higher level of in situ stresses and lower degree of weathering and unloading the correlation between hydraulic conductivity k and depth d has been shown on a variety of field measurements snow 1968 franciss 1970 carlsson and olsson 1977 ahlbom et al 1983a b black 1987 wei et al 1995 shmonov et al 2003 stober and bucher 2007 jiang et al 2010 winkler and reichl 2014 zhang 2013 achtziger zupančič et al 2017b piscopo et al 2017 if the lugeon values are separated into four discrete categories in the ranges of q 1 1 q 3 3 q 10 and 10 q 100 lu respectively based on the experiences in dam engineering e g li et al 2014 chen et al 2016 li et al 2017 it is shown that with the increase of depth the percentage of high lugeon values overall reduces and the percentage of low lugeon values increases accordingly fig 5 the variation of the hydraulic conductivity geometrically averaged at every 10 m interval of depth fig 6 shows that with the increase of depth from 5 to 500 m the geometric mean of hydraulic conductivity at each depth reduces by more than one order of magnitude from 1 9 10 6 to 7 3 10 8 m s it was found that this correlation can be best fitted by 4 k k 0 d α where k 0 m s is the hydraulic conductivity near the ground surface d m is the vertical depth from the valley flanks in the range between 5 and 520 m and α is an exponent in this study k 0 2 10 6 m s and α 0 48 with r2 0 93 it has been well understood leith et al 2014a b that the stress redistribution around the valleys tends to favor the growth of extensional fractures especially at shallow depths to account for this effect the relationship between k and d s where d s is the shortest distance to the valley flanks is often examined our results show that the k d s relationship is quite similar to the power relation between k and d eq 4 only with slightly different fitting parameters fig s3 in supplementary material this is because the valleys at the sites are steep and overall have relatively uniform gradients which results in a high correlation between d and d s as a comparison the best fitted k d relationships e g power or exponential function given by franciss 1970 carlsson and olsson 1977 wei et al 1995 and piscopo et al 2017 for igneous and or metamorphic rocks within 50 140 m depths are also plotted fig 6 these datasets are comparable to the data in this study because of a similar hydraulic conductivity range 10 9 10 5 m s the plot shows that the hydraulic conductivity of rocks in the deep incised valleys in southwest china is much larger over 1 2 orders of magnitude than that of other fractured aquifers which is attributed to the special geological setting favoring fracture development induced by strong unloading and weathering effects leith et al 2014a b furthermore in the shallow zone e g d 100 m the hydraulic conductivity reduces more rapidly with depth than that could be described by an exponential function piscopo et al 2017 the variation of standard deviation for the log transformed k data with depth shows that the standard deviation almost remains to 170 m of depth which is also attributed to more intense fracturing and then decreases with increasing depth fig 7 this correlation can be best fitted with the logistic function sivanesapillai et al 2014 which together with eq 4 describes the distribution of k at each depth in the study area 5 σ lg k σ 0 1 d d 0 β 1 where σ 0 d 0 m and β are fitting parameters in this study σ 0 0 6 d 0 428 m and β 4 7 with r2 0 86 the experimental semi variograms and correlation lengths of the de trended k along the vertical direction at the 12 test sites fig 8 show that the exponential model eq 3 well describes the experimental semi variograms at all sites with the correlation length ranging from 15 0 to 71 4 m the correlation lengths in this study are comparable to those of other crystalline aquifers ranging from 18 to 23 m e g ando et al 2003 but larger than the correlation lengths of porous aquifers 10 m e g turcke and kueper 1996 cheng et al 2011 3 3 discussion 3 3 1 influence of weathering and unloading the weathering and unloading processes lead to disintegration and decomposition of rocks at or near the ground surface both geologic processes affect the physico mechanical properties gupta and rao 2001 reduce the strength and intactness and have a significant effect on the permeability distribution morrow and lockner 2013 according to the zonation criteria table 2 the rock masses down from the ground surface can be typically classified into four zones of different weathering degree i e heavily weathered zone hwz upper moderately weathered zone umwz lower moderately weathered zone lmwz and slightly weathered unaltered fresh zone swz and three zones of different unloading degree i e strongly unloaded zone suz weakly unloaded zone wuz and unaffected intact zone uiz see fig 2 for an example seeking representative values of hydraulic conductivity in these weathering and unloading zones is vital to dam design and groundwater modelling similar to the variation in k with depth the percentage of high lugeon values fig 9 and the geometric mean k value table 4 decrease with decreasing degree of weathering and unloading from hwz to swz and from suz to uiz the geometric mean k value reduces roughly by 1 2 orders of magnitude table 4 this magnitude of k for weathered rocks and the reduction in k from weathered to unaltered fresh rocks in the study area are both comparable to the measurements for granite aquifers reported by megahan and clayton 1986 johnson maynard et al 1994 graham et al 1997 uchida et al 2003 and katsura et al 2009 and for crystalline rocks in mountainous area summarized by welch and allen 2014 however the weathered rocks in the study area have larger thicknesses table 4 compared to the weathered aquifers varying from 3 to 38 m in these studies furthermore since no hwzs could be distinctly identified except for the dagangshan dgs site the geometric mean k values of umwz lmwz and swz are comparable to those of suz wuz and uiz it should be noted that the geometric mean k value of the high permeability zones e g hwz umwz and suz may be less representative because the number of the collected data in these zones is relatively limited 3 3 2 influence of geologic structures the large scale geologic structures including faults dikes and shear zones in the study area tables s1 s3 in supplementary material may provide preferential flow paths ingebritsen and manning 2010 cox et al 2015 or prohibit groundwater flow micklethwaite 2009 thus it is of interest and practical value to examine the permeability of these geologic structures by properly locating the test sections in or across the faults dikes and shear zones present at the test sites the values of hydraulic conductivity from 43 faults at various depths were collected fig 10 these faults have not been active at least since the late pleistocene they are typically 0 1 5 0 m thick mostly nw to ne striking and steeply dipping and extending hundreds to thousands of meters table s1 in supplementary material according to their origins the faults are roughly classified into three types i e extensional faults compressional faults and shear faults faulkner and armitage 2013 the results show that the extensional faults overall display higher hydraulic conductivity with a geometric mean value of 6 0 10 7 m s the compressional faults and shear faults have comparable magnitude of hydraulic conductivity with their geometric mean values being 2 7 10 7 and 1 8 10 7 m s respectively furthermore the trend of hydraulic conductivity reduction with depth remains valid for each type of fault varying within 2 orders of magnitude as the depth increases to 300 m fig 10 the magnitude of fault s hydraulic conductivity in this study is comparable to the transmissivity measurements in fault zones in crystalline rock basements i e granite gneiss and micaschist by roques et al 2016 where the k value calculated by transmissivity and the thickness of flow zone varies within three orders of magnitude between 3 2 10 8 m s and 7 4 10 5 m s within 160 m depth the standard deviation of the log transformed k data for the faults in the study area mostly exhibits a narrow range between 0 10 and 0 23 and does not show a distinct decrease with depth fig 11 tuff shear zones are commonly found at the baihetan bht and xiluodu xld dam sites different from shear faults these tuff shear zones were formed in tuffs by shear dislocation between basalt layers originated from successive volcanic eruption episodes table s2 in supplementary material the shear zones are gently dipping typically about 0 1 0 6 m thick structures filled with tuff fragments breccia and gouge the permeability of the shear zones is highly anisotropic with a potential permeability contrast of 2 orders of magnitude between in plane direction and perpendicular to the shear zone wang et al 2009 the hydraulic conductivity data fig 12 mainly represents the in plane permeability of the shear zones showing again that the k values decrease with depth the geometric mean value of the in plane hydraulic conductivity is 5 0 10 7 m s comparable to that of extensional faults but the standard deviation of the lgk data for shear zones mostly between 0 25 and 0 45 is remarkably higher than that of faults fig 11 the hydraulic conductivity data for lamprophyre dikes from the jp i and sjk shuangjiangkou sites diabase dikes from the dgs site and granite pegmatite dikes from the sjk site table s3 in supplementary material was also collected fig 13 showing that the k values mostly fall in the range between 10 7 and 10 6 m s only the k values for diabase dikes show a decreasing trend with depth while the depth trend for the lamprophyre and granite pegmatite dikes is not clear due possibly to the limited number of measurements the standard deviation of the lgk data for these dikes varies in a larger range 0 05 0 3 compared to those of faults fig 11 3 3 3 influence of lithology the influence of lithology on rock hydraulic conductivity remains controversial davis and turk 1964 gustafson and krásný 1994 masset and loew 2010 winkler and reichl 2014 achtziger zupančič et al 2017b the best fitted parameters k 0 α of hydraulic conductivity with depth by the power function eq 4 for the test sites with the same lithology are rather scattered fig 14 indicating that the permeability is not solely governed by lithology but more by the geologic structures in the rocks this is consistent with the findings by winkler and reichl 2014 roques et al 2016 and achtziger zupančič et al 2017b for crystalline rocks 4 conclusions in this study a total of 13 397 hydraulic conductivity measurements were collected by borehole packer tests at 12 high dam sites in southwest china the statistical distribution and vertical variation of hydraulic conductivity of rocks in this mountainous area was investigated by using hypothesis testing regression analysis and semi variogram analysis the factors that influence the hydraulic conductivity distribution including the degree of weathering and unloading geologic structures and lithology were quantified the results show that the hydraulic conductivity of the fractured rocks in this area follows a log normal distribution for different depths with a geometric mean of 2 2 10 7 m s and a standard deviation of 0 57 for lgk within 600 m depth the hydraulic conductivity k m s decreases with depth d m and can be described by the power function k 2 10 6 d 0 48 with a high coefficient of determination of r2 0 93 the standard deviation of lgk is best fitted by the logistic function σ lg k 0 6 1 d 428 4 7 with r2 0 86 similarly the geometric mean hydraulic conductivity decreases by about one order of magnitude with decreasing degree of weathering and unloading it has been found that the hydraulic conductivity in the study area is mainly controlled by geologic structures of various origins and scales and less by lithology the results are useful for modelling of groundwater flow solute transport and hyporheic exchange in the deep

data collected at 12 high dam sites in southwest china the statistical distribution of hydraulic conductivity of rocks in this deep incised valley area was investigated using hypothesis test regression analysis and semi variogram analysis showing that the hydraulic conductivity of igneous and metamorphic rocks at various depths in the study area follows a log normal distribution within 600 m depth the vertical variation in hydraulic conductivity k m s and standard deviation of lgk with depth d m can be best described by the power function k 2 10 6 d 0 48 and the logistic function σ lg k 0 6 1 d 428 4 7 it is deduced that the decreasing degree of weathering and unloading from ground surface to unaltered fresh rocks leads to reduction in the geometric mean of hydraulic conductivity by about 1 2 orders of magnitude the hydraulic conductivity of rocks in the study area is more controlled by geologic structures of various origins and scales and less by lithology the

distributions are suitable for low permeability fine grained porous media such as silt and silty clay and the bimodal distribution is usually applied to heterogeneous porous media such as sand silt and clay mixtures where the permeability of each constituent differs greatly the log normal distribution is most widely used which is suitable for both homogeneous and heterogeneous media including crystalline rocks but more appropriate for coarse grained porous media like sand and gravel over the last two decades a considerable number of high dams have been built in southwest china for water

weathering and unloading zonation downward from the ground surface zhou et al 2015 chen et al 2016 hong et al 2017 in which persistent geologic structures of different origins and scales develop these geologic features may lead to stronger spatial variability of rock s hydraulic conductivity compared to aquifers in other areas the main goal of this study was to develop a detailed characterization of hydraulic conductivity of the fractured rocks within 600 m depth in the valley area in southwest china a total of 13 397 packer tests performed at 12 dam sites in this area were collected and statistically analyzed the specific objectives of the study were to i examine the spatial variability of hydraulic conductivity at different depths ii reveal the vertical distribution of hydraulic

resources in the upstream yangtze river and its tributaries i e the jinsha river yalong river dadu river and min river in this mountainous landscape the rivers incise deeply into the bedrocks as a result of continued uplifting of the tibetan plateau forming v shaped or u shaped valleys with steep gradients and high relative altitudes from the stream beds table 1 over the past two decades a

permeability of the foundation rocks and for the design of impervious barriers this technique has been long and widely applied in dam and civil engineering lugeon 1933 snow 1968 louis and maini 1970 houlsby 1976 price et al 1977 bliss and rushton 1984 brassington and walthall 1985 mollah and sayed 1995 neuman 2005 both in saturated zones and in vadose zones other techniques such as pumping test theis 1935 batu 1998 and slug test lu et al 1999 quinn et al 2013 were rarely conducted which allows for data calibration but not for statistical analysis the lugeon tests performed at these sites strictly followed industrial standards after borehole drilling and flushing water was injected at constant pressure into each packer isolated section of the boreholes the injection pressure was stepwise increased from p 1 0 3 mpa to p 2 0 6 mpa and to p 3 1 0 mpa when the steady state condition had been reached for each injection step i e after five or more readings of flow rate at 1 2 min intervals were equal which was followed by a stepwise release of the injection pressure the radius r w of the test boreholes was 38 mm and the length l of the test sections varied between 3 7 and 6 4 m this study collected a total of 13 397 lugeon test data performed in 614 boreholes drilled vertically from ground surfaces or exploratory tunnels at different elevations at the aforementioned 12 dam sites see table 1 for the number of tests at each site the deepest test sections were located at about 593 m below the ground surface here an example is given for the left bank half of a typical geological cross section at the jp i dam site fig 2 where the geologic features and the layout of the exploratory tunnels and boreholes are plotted chen et al 2016 these data are believed to be representative of the permeability of bedrocks in the deep incised valleys in southwest china 2 3 data interpretation and analysis as commonly done in the literature the packer test data was interpreted with two quantities in this study i e lugeon value q for characterizing the intactness and groutability of rocks and hydraulic conductivity k for representing the permeability of the tested rocks the lugeon value q lu is calculated by q q lp typically at the last injection pressure step i e p 1 mpa where q l min is the injected flow rate under the steady state condition l m is the length of test section and p mpa is the injection pressure the calculation of hydraulic conductivity k m s from the packer test data relies on a proper choice of darcy s law based interpretive models

study due to lack of independent measurements for the anisotropic ratio of horizontal to vertical hydraulic conductivity needed for interpretation e g hvorslev 1951 zlotnik 1994 the variation of k with depth was evaluated with its geometric mean at every 10 m interval warren and price 1961 desbarats 1987 durlofsky 1991 hinrichsen et al 1993 the geometric mean values of k in the zones of different degree of weathering and unloading were also calculated see table 2 for the criteria for weathering and unloading zonation in the study area the spatial variability of k was evaluated by the experimental variogram using the classical estimator matheron 1963 without the removal of outliers which reads 2 γ h 1 2 n h i 1 n h z x i z x i h 2 where γ h is the semi variogram n h is the number of experimental pairs separated by distance h m z xi m s is the measured value at location xi and z xi h m s is the value at a distance h from xi the semi variogram was calculated in the vertical direction due to the limited test locations in the horizontal direction given the conductivity depth trend in this study see section 3 2 we calculated the semi variogram with conductivities de trended by the k d relationship see eq 4 at each site following the approach by volpi and gambolati 1978 and dingman et al 1988 furthermore the exponential variogram model isaaks and srivastava 1989 was used to fit the experimental semi variogram 3 γ h n c 1 exp 3 h λ where n is a parameter for the nugget effect n 0 in this study c is the sill and λ m is the correlation length 3 results 3 1 variability of rock s hydraulic conductivity the obtained hydraulic conductivity measurements from all the test sites vary within four orders of magnitude between 1 3 10 9 m s and 2 6 10 5 m s with a geometric mean of 2 2 10 7 m s and a standard deviation σ lg k of 0 57 for the log transformed k data lgk the geometric mean k value of the measurements collected at each test site varies in the range of 1 8 10 7 m s and the σ lg k value varies between 0 38 and 0 70 table 3 the histogram of the k values from all the test sites after a logarithmic transformation shows that the lgk values roughly follow a normal distribution fig 3 to verify this hypothesis both the normal quantile plot rehfeldt et al 1992 ryan and boufadel 2007 cheng et al 2011 and the mann whitney u test siddiqui and parizek 1971 were applied in this study the normal quantile plot of the measured lgk data versus a normal distribution fig 4 displays an equal line with a high coefficient of determination r2 0 97 this confirms that the lgk data is normally distributed i e the k values follow a log normal distribution which is additionally underpinned by the mann whitney u test the 95 confidence interval for lgk fig 3 indicates that the hydraulic conductivity of the fractured aquifers in the study area varies mostly within two orders of magnitude between 1 7 10 8 m s and 2 9 10 6 m s the distribution of the k values at every 20 m interval of depth was also examined by the hypothesis test fig s1 in supplementary material the results show that the k values again follow the log normal distribution for different depths within 600 m from ground surface it should be noted that with further increase of depth there is a progressive change from fracture dominated flow to matrix dominated flow which may result in a changing distribution of data achtziger zupančič et al 2017a b furthermore the histograms of the k data at each site and their hypothesis tests fig s2 in supplementary material show that the log normal distribution could also approximately describe the distribution of k at each site with r2 0 90 3 2 vertical distributions of rock s hydraulic conductivity it has been well understood that with the increase of depth from ground surface the rock is less disturbed and hence is reduced the hydraulic conductivity as a function of lower fracture density higher level of in situ stresses and lower degree of weathering and unloading the correlation between hydraulic conductivity k and depth d has been shown on a variety of field measurements snow 1968 franciss 1970 carlsson and olsson 1977 ahlbom et al 1983a b black 1987 wei et al 1995 shmonov et al 2003 stober and bucher 2007 jiang et al 2010 winkler and reichl 2014 zhang 2013 achtziger zupančič et al 2017b piscopo et al 2017 if the lugeon values are separated into four discrete categories in the ranges of q 1 1 q 3 3 q 10 and 10 q 100 lu respectively based on the experiences in dam engineering e g li et al 2014 chen et al 2016 li et al 2017 it is shown that with the increase of depth the percentage of high lugeon values overall reduces and the percentage of low lugeon values increases accordingly fig 5 the variation of the hydraulic conductivity geometrically averaged at every 10 m interval of depth fig 6 shows that with the increase of depth from 5 to 500 m the geometric mean of hydraulic conductivity at each depth reduces by more than one order of magnitude from 1 9 10 6 to 7 3 10 8 m s it was found that this correlation can be best fitted by 4 k k 0 d α where k 0 m s is the hydraulic conductivity near the ground surface d m is the vertical depth from the valley flanks in the range between 5 and 520 m and α is an exponent in this study k 0 2 10 6 m s and α 0 48 with r2 0 93 it has been well understood leith et al 2014a b that the stress redistribution around the valleys tends to favor the growth of extensional fractures especially at shallow depths to account for this effect the relationship between k and d s where d s is the shortest distance to the valley flanks is often examined our results show that the k d s relationship is quite similar to the power relation between k and d eq 4 only with slightly different fitting parameters fig s3 in supplementary material this is because the valleys at the sites are steep and overall have relatively uniform gradients which results in a high correlation between d and d s as a comparison the best fitted k d relationships e g power or exponential function given by franciss 1970 carlsson and olsson 1977 wei et al 1995 and piscopo et al 2017 for igneous and or metamorphic rocks within 50 140 m depths are also plotted fig 6 these datasets are comparable to the data in this study because of a similar hydraulic conductivity range 10 9 10 5 m s the plot shows that the hydraulic conductivity of rocks in the deep incised valleys in southwest china is much larger over 1 2 orders of magnitude than that of other fractured aquifers which is attributed to the special geological setting favoring fracture development induced by strong unloading and weathering effects leith et al 2014a b furthermore in the shallow zone e g d 100 m the hydraulic conductivity reduces more rapidly with depth than that could be described by an exponential function piscopo et al 2017 the variation of standard deviation for the log transformed k data with depth shows that the standard deviation almost remains to 170 m of depth which is also attributed to more intense fracturing and then decreases with increasing depth fig 7 this correlation can be best fitted with the logistic function sivanesapillai et al 2014 which together with eq 4 describes the distribution of k at each depth in the study area 5 σ lg k σ 0 1 d d 0 β 1 where σ 0 d 0 m and β are fitting parameters in this study σ 0 0 6 d 0 428 m and β 4 7 with r2 0 86 the experimental semi variograms and correlation lengths of the de trended k along the vertical direction at the 12 test sites fig 8 show that the exponential model eq 3 well describes the experimental semi variograms at all sites with the correlation length ranging from 15 0 to 71 4 m the correlation lengths in this study are comparable to those of other crystalline aquifers ranging from 18 to 23 m e g ando et al 2003 but larger than the correlation lengths of porous aquifers 10 m e g turcke and kueper 1996 cheng et al 2011 3 3 discussion 3 3 1 influence of weathering and unloading the weathering and unloading processes lead to disintegration and decomposition of rocks at or near the ground surface both geologic processes affect the physico mechanical properties gupta and rao 2001 reduce the strength and intactness and have a significant effect on the permeability distribution morrow and lockner 2013 according to the zonation criteria table 2 the rock masses down from the ground surface can be typically classified into four zones of different weathering degree i e heavily weathered zone hwz upper moderately weathered zone umwz lower moderately weathered zone lmwz and slightly weathered unaltered fresh zone swz and three zones of different unloading degree i e strongly unloaded zone suz weakly unloaded zone wuz and unaffected intact zone uiz see fig 2 for an example seeking representative values of hydraulic conductivity in these weathering and unloading zones is vital to dam design and groundwater modelling similar to the variation in k with depth the percentage of high lugeon values fig 9 and the geometric mean k value table 4 decrease with decreasing degree of weathering and unloading from hwz to swz and from suz to uiz the geometric mean k value reduces roughly by 1 2 orders of magnitude table 4 this magnitude of k for weathered rocks and the reduction in k from weathered to unaltered fresh rocks in the study area are both comparable to the measurements for granite aquifers reported by megahan and clayton 1986 johnson maynard et al 1994 graham et al 1997 uchida et al 2003 and katsura et al 2009 and for crystalline rocks in mountainous area summarized by welch and allen 2014 however the weathered rocks in the study area have larger thicknesses table 4 compared to the weathered aquifers varying from 3 to 38 m in these studies furthermore since no hwzs could be distinctly identified except for the dagangshan dgs site the geometric mean k values of umwz lmwz and swz are comparable to those of suz wuz and uiz it should be noted that the geometric mean k value of the high permeability zones e g hwz umwz and suz may be less representative because the number of the collected data in these zones is relatively limited 3 3 2 influence of geologic structures the large scale geologic structures including faults dikes and shear zones in the study area tables s1 s3 in supplementary material may provide preferential flow paths ingebritsen and manning 2010 cox et al 2015 or prohibit groundwater flow micklethwaite 2009 thus it is of interest and practical value to examine the permeability of these geologic structures by properly locating the test sections in or across the faults dikes and shear zones present at the test sites the values of hydraulic conductivity from 43 faults at various depths were collected fig 10 these faults have not been active at least since the late pleistocene they are typically 0 1 5 0 m thick mostly nw to ne striking and steeply dipping and extending hundreds to thousands of meters table s1 in supplementary material according to their origins the faults are roughly classified into three types i e extensional faults compressional faults and shear faults faulkner and armitage 2013 the results show that the extensional faults overall display higher hydraulic conductivity with a geometric mean value of 6 0 10 7 m s the compressional faults and shear faults have comparable magnitude of hydraulic conductivity with their geometric mean values being 2 7 10 7 and 1 8 10 7 m s respectively furthermore the trend of hydraulic conductivity reduction with depth remains valid for each type of fault varying within 2 orders of magnitude as the depth increases to 300 m fig 10 the magnitude of fault s hydraulic conductivity in this study is comparable to the transmissivity measurements in fault zones in crystalline rock basements i e granite gneiss and micaschist by roques et al 2016 where the k value calculated by transmissivity and the thickness of flow zone varies within three orders of magnitude between 3 2 10 8 m s and 7 4 10 5 m s within 160 m depth the standard deviation of the log transformed k data for the faults in the study area mostly exhibits a narrow range between 0 10 and 0 23 and does not show a distinct decrease with depth fig 11 tuff shear zones are commonly found at the baihetan bht and xiluodu xld dam sites different from shear faults these tuff shear zones were formed in tuffs by shear dislocation between basalt layers originated from successive volcanic eruption episodes table s2 in supplementary material the shear zones are gently dipping typically about 0 1 0 6 m thick structures filled with tuff fragments breccia and gouge the permeability of the shear zones is highly anisotropic with a potential permeability contrast of 2 orders of magnitude between in plane direction and perpendicular to the shear zone wang et al 2009 the hydraulic conductivity data fig 12 mainly represents the in plane permeability of the shear zones showing again that the k values decrease with depth the geometric mean value of the in plane hydraulic conductivity is 5 0 10 7 m s comparable to that of extensional faults but the standard deviation of the lgk data for shear zones mostly between 0 25 and 0 45 is remarkably higher than that of faults fig 11 the hydraulic conductivity data for lamprophyre dikes from the jp i and sjk shuangjiangkou sites diabase dikes from the dgs site and granite pegmatite dikes from the sjk site table s3 in supplementary material was also collected fig 13 showing that the k values mostly fall in the range between 10 7 and 10 6 m s only the k values for diabase dikes show a decreasing trend with depth while the depth trend for the lamprophyre and granite pegmatite dikes is not clear due possibly to the limited number of measurements the standard deviation of the lgk data for these dikes varies in a larger range 0 05 0 3 compared to those of faults fig 11 3 3 3 influence of lithology the influence of lithology on rock hydraulic conductivity remains controversial davis and turk 1964 gustafson and krásný 1994 masset and loew 2010 winkler and reichl 2014 achtziger zupančič et al 2017b the best fitted parameters k 0 α of hydraulic conductivity with depth by the power function eq 4 for the test sites with the same lithology are rather scattered fig 14 indicating that the permeability is not solely governed by lithology but more by the geologic structures in the rocks this is consistent with the findings by winkler and reichl 2014 roques et al 2016 and achtziger zupančič et al 2017b for crystalline rocks 4 conclusions in this study a total of 13 397 hydraulic conductivity measurements were collected by borehole packer tests at 12 high dam sites in southwest china the statistical distribution and vertical variation of hydraulic conductivity of rocks in this mountainous area was investigated by using hypothesis testing regression analysis and semi variogram analysis the factors that influence the hydraulic conductivity distribution including the degree of weathering and unloading geologic structures and lithology were quantified the results show that the hydraulic conductivity of the fractured rocks in this area follows a log normal distribution for different depths with a geometric mean of 2 2 10 7 m s and a standard deviation of 0 57 for lgk within 600 m depth the hydraulic conductivity k m s decreases with depth d m and can be described by the power function k 2 10 6 d 0 48 with a high coefficient of determination of r2 0 93 the standard deviation of lgk is best fitted by the logistic function σ lg k 0 6 1 d 428 4 7 with r2 0 86 similarly the geometric mean hydraulic conductivity decreases by about one order of magnitude with decreasing degree of weathering and unloading it has been found that the hydraulic conductivity in the study area is mainly controlled by geologic structures of various origins and scales and less by lithology the results are useful for modelling of groundwater flow solute transport and hyporheic exchange in the deep

6939,in order to assess the role of the biotic and abiotic components of natural mineral water nmw in the spread of allochthonous bacteria in non thermal spa facilities we examined the effect of low mineralized nmws on the growth of several commensal and pathogenic human strains these nmws were collected from two spanish spring spas and had different microbiological characteristics microorganisms were exposed to untreated filtered and autoclaved nmws at the temperatures of 22 c and 37 c for 2 days mimicking the early stage of starvation starvation stress was controlled by the effect identified after incubation in saline changes in culturability after exposure were used as a measure of the water s antibacterial effect the specific biotic and abiotic effect of nmws on the suppression of bacterial growth was estimated after excluding the bacterial response to starvation stress characteristic of this natural oligotrophic environment the incubation temperature strongly modulated both the consequences of starvation and the impact of the natural biotic and abiotic components of nmws on the growth of commensal and pathogenic bacteria a temperature of 22 c conferred cross protection of microorganisms to starvation and nmw abiotic stress whereas a temperature of 37 c decreased the tolerance to both and had a negative influence on the abundance and diversity of nmws microflora this temperature dependent behaviour of the allochthonous and autochthonous bacteria explained the different culturability of microorganisms after exposure to untreated nmws at 22 c 1 2 4 log colony forming units per ml cfu ml mean reduction and at 37 c 1 8 3 2 log cfu ml mean reduction discarding the effect of starvation we estimated that the antibacterial effect of nmws at the temperature of 22 c was mainly driven by the microecosystem of nmws which explained 95 of nmw response in contrast at optimal temperatures for the growth of commensal and pathogenic microorganisms 60 of the antibacterial response of nmws was associated with the abiotic components of nmws the biotic and abiotic components of nmws self preserve the quality of water preventing the progression of human pathogenic organisms that can occasionally cause water colonization the influence of the intrinsic components of nmws on the suppression of microbial growth is strongly modulated by environmental temperature keywords natural mineral water allochthonous bacteria pathogenic antibacterial effect microflora temperature 1 introduction natural spa therapy hydrotherapy balneotherapy and climatotherapy is a non pharmacological and popular approach widely used in european countries which involves natural mineral waters nmws to treat various illnesses including rheumatological diseases morer et al 2017 tenti et al 2015 a recent systematic review that combined data from 27 double blind randomized controlled trials reported on the effectiveness of mineral bathing or mineral mud application in rheumatology patients supported the co benefit of simultaneous pharmacological and spa treatments and demonstrated a clear alternative to conventional pharmacology in cases of drug intolerance morer et al 2017 the mineral component of nmws has been proposed as the main mechanism to explain the beneficial effect of spa therapy morer et al 2017 tenti et al 2015 nmws originate mainly from intermediate aquifers and retain the physicochemical and microbiological characteristics found in the natural source leclerc and moreau 2002 the microbial ecosystem of nmws is of great complexity contains high phenotypic and genetic diversity a high number of bacterial genera casanovas massana and blanch 2012 loy et al 2005 rittershaus et al 2013 vachee et al 1997 and varies widely even among springs within close proximity casanovas massana and blanch 2012 mathur et al 2007 this variability is explained by the fact that the phylogenetic diversity of autochthonous bacteria is closely related to the predominant mineral chemistry of spring waters and vice versa belkova et al 2007 hegler et al 2012 mathur et al 2007 the autochthonous microflora of nmws contributes significantly to the chemical composition of water through the biologically controlled mineralization process of surrounding environments belkova et al 2007 furthermore this microflora has a notable influence on the control of the microbial diversity of nmws via cross feeding and competing mechanisms mahajan and balachandran 2017 mathur et al 2007 thomashow 1997 as microbiologically wholesome water leclerc and moreau 2002 nmw cannot be subjected to any treatment or additions to preserve its essential constituents and microbiological characteristics and ultimately its beneficial effects directive96 70 ec thus natural spas are prone to contamination by a great variety of allochthonous bacteria including commensal and pathogenic organisms of fecal coliforms and enterococci and non fecal pseudomonas sp and staphylococci human origin hlavsa et al 2015 serrano et al 2012 willke et al 2009 however few outbreaks linked to natural spring water have been reported mainly caused by e coli hlavsa et al 2015 willke et al 2009 the limited transmission and spread of microbial infections could be related to the reduced survival of human pathogenic bacteria under the harsh conditions found in nmws ohno et al 2003 pianetti et al 2008 it is important to note that natural sources of nmws are oligotrophic environments which as in the case of autochthonous flora must have developed adaptation mechanisms in order to survive for long periods of time under nutrient deprivation leclerc and moreau 2002 in these hostile environments a common survival strategy for bacteria is to enter a physiological state of starvation survival in which the energy requirements are extremely low morita 1997 the oligotrophic bacterial ecosystem of nmws also plays an important role in the survival of pathogenic bacteria ducluzeau et al 1984 korhonen and martikainen 1991 leclerc and moreau 2002 lechevallier and mcfeters 1985 ramalho et al 2001 vachee et al 1997 this ecosystem combined with the physicochemical properties of nmws could exert a certain influence on the spread of pathogens in these environments giampaoli et al 2013 serrano et al 2012 in this respect a recent study by our group has reported a direct relationship between mineralization levels and the survival of pathogenic bacteria in nmws serrano et al 2012 to fill the gap in our knowledge about the influence of the living biotic and non living abiotic components of nmw ecosystem in the survival of microorganisms in this study commensal and pathogenic human bacteria which can be released by human contact into spring spas e coli enterococci and staphylococci were exposed for a short period of time to two nmws with different microbiological and chemical characteristics therefore the role of these biotic and abiotic components in the preservation of microbiological quality of waters of natural spas will be assessed 2 material and methods 2 1 strains three control strains staphylococcus aureus atcc 25923 sa staphylococcus epidermidis atcc 35984 se and escherichia coli atcc 25922 ec as well as three clinical isolates s aureus sac from complicated skin and soft tissue infections e coli ecc and enterococcus faecalis efc from patients with urinary tract infections were used the strains were stored at 70 c in skim milk and were subcultured on columbia agar plates becton dickinson and co bd detroit mi three times before each experiment 2 2 water samples the natural mineral waters used were collected from two spring spas with different climatic and geochemical characteristics located in the south tolox nmw1 and in the west alange nmw2 of spain table 1 nmw samples were aseptically obtained in autumn in gamma irradiated 1 l polypropylene flasks and kept in the dark to prevent photochemical reactions samples were refrigerated on site and were immediately transported to the microbiology laboratory for processing nmw aliquots were filtered labelled as fw1 and fw2 through 0 2 µm pore size membranes in order to remove indigenous flora and to preserve the mineral content and the metabolic products of the natural micro ecosystem additional nmw aliquots were autoclaved labelled as aw1 and aw2 at 121 c for 21 min to kill microbial content and to inactivate any virtually present metabolites or bacteriocins water ph remained unchanged after autoclaving ensuring that the mineral content was preserved water filtration and sterilization were carried out in the laboratory the day before use sterile distilled deionized water from a direct q 5 uv system merck kgaa darmstadt germany supplemented with 0 9 sodium chloride scw and filter sterilized through a 0 2 mm filter sartorius goeltingen germany was used as control water analysis was performed at the balneology laboratory of the professional school of medical hydrology school of medicine universidad complutense 2 3 autochthonous bacterial counts one hundred ml of nmw were incubated at 22 c and 37 c for up to 7 days within 48 h of sampling from spas after 0 1 2 and 7 days samples of 50 µl were plated in parallel onto reasoner s 2a agar plates bd using a spiral platter workstation don whitley scientific shipley uk and incubated for 2 days at 37 c and for 21 days at 22 c reasoner and geldreich 1985 prior to colony counting this procedure was also performed using fws and aws to ensure sample sterility all experiments were performed on three separate occasions results were expressed as colony forming unit per ml cfu ml the detection limit of this procedure was 20 cfu ml 2 4 experimental survival curves survival assays were carried out in flasks containing 100 ml of nmw aw fw or scw tempered at room temperature 20 c until they were inoculated with 1 ml of a standard suspension of the microorganism prior to the experiments three to four colonies of each microorganism from a fresh culture of columbia agar bd were grown overnight 16 20 h in an orbital shaker 100 r p m at 37 c in tryptic soy broth tsb bd bacteria were harvested by centrifugation 3 000 g for 10 min washed three times in nmw fw aw or scw and spectrophotometrically adjusted gbc model cintra 101 braeside australia to a standardized inoculum of 1 x 108 cfu ml this procedure ensures the removal of trace amounts of nutrient from the culture media one millilitre of this standard suspension was incorporated into a flask to reach an initial density of 1 x 106 cfu ml flasks were incubated for 2 days at 22 c and at 37 c all experiments were repeated three times samples collected after an incubation of 0 1 and 2 days were serially diluted in 0 9 sodium chloride and spiral plated onto agar media samples from aw fw and scw were simultaneously plated onto columbia agar bd and onto selective growth media for pathogenic bacteria manitol salt agar bd macconkey agar bd and bacteroides bile esculin agar bd were used as selective media for the recovery of staphylococci e coli and e faecalis respectively samples from pure nmw were plated onto r2a agar columbia agar and onto selective growth media columbia agar and selective media plates were incubated at 37 c for 2 days for colony counting r2a agar plates were incubated according to the incubation temperature of former flasks at 37 c for 2 days or at 22 c for 21 days complete recovery of microorganisms was achieved on selective media as judged by viable counts detected on the columbia agar plates in nmw samples when they appeared autochthonous bacteria were partially inhibited in the selective media the count of the autochthonous bacteria in the r2a agar from the nmw samples was carried out after discarding the number of inoculated microorganisms according to the morphological aspect of the colonies grown 2 5 measurement of the effects of water the change in the number of culturable bacteria in log10 cfu ml after two days of water exposure with respect to the initial inocula was used as a measure of the water s effect on the inoculated microorganisms bacterial counts from selective media were used for all water tested the biotic and abiotic effects of nmws were estimated for all strains using the reduction in the number of culturable bacteria obtained in the different waters the abiotic effect ae was calculated as aw effect swc effect the biotic effect was calculated as the sum of bp effect related to biocide products c bacterial competition where bp was the fw effect ae and c was the nmw effect bp 2 6 statistical analysis the comparison of the effect of the waters at the temperature of 22 c or 37 c and between both temperatures was performed by the two tailed t test or by the analysis of variance anova using the tukey test for multiple comparisons as needed 3 results 3 1 autochthonous bacteria in modified and pure spring waters as shown in fig 1 the basal abundance and the growing pattern of autochthonous bacteria in the uninoculated nmws were markedly different and dependent on the temperature of incubation basal counts were significantly higher at 22 c than at 37 c for nmw2 3 0 0 5 and 1 4 0 5 log10 cfu ml respectively p 0 01 counts for nmw1 were below the detection limit 1 3 log10 cfu ml regardless of the incubation temperature the bacterial load recovered from day 2 onwards was also higher at 22 c than at 37 c on days 2 and 7 counts increased by 0 83 log cfu ml and 1 27 log cfu ml p 0 01 for nmw1 samples and 1 25 log cfu ml p 0 01 and 2 74 log cfu ml p 0 01 for nmw2 samples at 22 c with respect to those at 37 c large differences in bacterial diversity were also observed at both temperatures based on the morphology of the colonies grown on r2a agar in nmw2 11 and 3 distinct species contributed to the bacterial load recovered at 22 c and 37 c respectively throughout the experiment the microbial diversity in nmw1 was lower in comparison to nmw2 with only four types of different organisms identified at 22 c on the inoculated nmws autochthonous bacteria counts were similar to those detected on the uninoculated samples throughout the microorganism exposure irrespective of the strain type of water or temperature of incubation assayed indicating that the presence of the commensal or pathogen bacteria had no effect on the survival of autochthonous flora fig 2 shows the comparative quantification of autochthonous flora in the inoculated and uninoculated waters after two days of exposure autochthonous bacteria were not detected in either fws or aws irrespective of the incubation temperature 3 2 effect of modified and pure spring waters on culturability of microorganisms the effect expressed as the log cfu ml reduction of bacterial count with respect to the initial inocula of commensal and pathogenic strains after 2 days under nutrient deprivation scw or exposure to modified aws and fws or pure nmws at the temperatures of 22 c and 37 c is summarized in tables 2 and 3 in scw bacterial counts for all strains remained constant or slightly increased throughout the experiment with respect to the initial inocula at the temperature of 22 c whereas at 37 c the bacterial burden decreased for all strains mean reduction 1 log unit indicating that temperature influenced the culturability of microorganisms under starvation the decline in bacterial counts at 37 c with respect to 22 c range from 0 11 to 2 58 log10 units was strains dependent and significant for all staphylococcal strains modified and pure spring waters had a greater effect on the reduction of culturability regardless of the incubation temperature tables 2 and 3 the highest reduction in the number of culturable bacteria was found in both nmws and this decreased gradually in fws and aws as the biological components subtracted from the nmw ecosystem increased the suppression of growth on modified and pure spring water followed the same temperature dependent pattern of exposure response described in swc at the temperature of 22 c nmws significantly reduced culturable bacteria compared to scw or aws for most strains nmw1 p 0 01 for sa and sac and p 0 05 for se and ec nmw2 p 0 01 for all strains except for efc indicating that the biological components of nmws are crucial in the final inhibitory effect of spring waters aws and scw did cause similar effects on microorganisms however at the temperature of 37 c aws exposure caused a dramatic fall in culturability compared with scw for some strains aw1 p 0 01 for sa and sac and p 0 05 for ec aw2 p 0 01 for sa and sac and p 0 05 for efc probably owing to the synergistic effect of nutrient deprivation and some components preserved in the autoclaved waters at this temperature nmws significantly reduced the bacterial load with respect to scw p 0 01 for all strains except efc on nmw1 and interestingly the differences in the culturability between aws and nmws decreased nmw1 p 0 01 for se nmw2 p 0 05 for ec this was explained by the fact that temperature had a different influence on the effect of modified and pure nmws the high temperatures substantially enhanced the effects of aws on microorganisms aw1 p 0 01 for sa se sac and ec aw2 p 0 01 for sa se and sac and p 0 05 for ecc and efc but had little impact on the effects of nmws by comparison and in particular of nmw2 nmw1 p 0 01 for staphylococcal species and p 0 05 for ecc nmw2 p 0 01 for efc and p 0 05 for ecc and sac comparing both types of waters modified and pure nmw2 resulted in a more adverse environment for survival than the homologous nmw1 regardless of temperature no significant differences were found between aws 0 11 and 1 78 vs 0 00 and 2 34 log unit drop at 22 c and 37 c for aw1 and aw2 respectively or fws 0 40 and 1 76 vs 0 78 2 64 log unit drop in contrast the exposure to nmw2 1 00 and 2 12 vs 2 45 and 3 24 log unit drop in mean counts at 22 c and 37 c for nmw1 and nmw2 resulted in significantly reduced cfu compared to those obtained in nmw1 for 3 strains p 0 05 sa and p 0 01 ec and ecc at 22 c and 5 strains p 0 05 sa sac ecc and efc and p 0 01 ec at 37 c individual antimicrobial responses obtained in the different waters were used in a subsequent analysis to estimate the direct effect of the abiotic and biotic components of nmw1 and nmw2 in the suppression of growth of microorganisms after discarding the resulting effects of starvation stress comparable starvation effects were assumed in swc nmw1 and nmw2 the interplay between temperature and the estimated effects of the biotic and abiotic constituents of nmws is shown in fig 3 as seen the contribution of aws compounds ae in the response was negligible 1 7 to 4 9 of total mean effects for nmw1 and nmw2 respectively compared to the effects related to the bacterial ecosystem bp and c of each water type at the temperature of 22 c instead aws compounds contributed largely to nmws effects at 37 c 70 1 and 60 8 of total mean effects for nmw1 and nmw2 respectively which was linked to the detrimental effect of increased temperature on the abundance and diversity of bacterial flora in each nmw and particularly in nmw2 4 discussion while the physicochemical properties and physiological effects of nmws are well known by comparison the study of factors involving the survival of allochthonous bacteria in this complex aquatic environment has received less attention abiotic factors such as temperature have a profound influence on the size and diversity of the ecosystem of nmws mathur et al 2007 and similarly the living biotic and non living abiotic intrinsic components of nmw influence the progression of colonizing allochthonous bacteria in agreement with previous studies our work confirmed the influence of temperature on the ability of pathogenic bacteria to survive in aqueous nutrient deprived environments arana et al 2010 bravo et al 2016 price and sowers 2004 and interestingly both the biotic the microbial ecosystem and the abiotic components of nmws the mineral chemistry are decisive factors to explain the loss of culturability of allochthonous bacteria at least in the early stages of starvation moreover our results also demonstrate that the relative impact of biotic and abiotic factors on the growth of allochthonous bacteria is modulated by temperature we found that the culturability of pathogenic bacteria under stringent nutrient deprivation scw was strongly influenced by temperature and that in the face of this environmental hostility the survival of commensal and pathogenic microorganisms improves at temperatures below the optimum growth temperatures for mesophilic organisms the tolerance to stressful scw conditions seen at the temperature of 22 c is the result of the initial adaptive response of microorganisms that occurs at the beginning of nutrient deprivation kurath and morita 1983 which due to the energy from the endogenous metabolism of cellular constituents accumulated under conditions of nutrient excess is sufficient for the maintenance of physiological functions but not to achieve a sustained growth if the deprivation of nutrients persists this physiological state of maintenance results in a significant reduction of the bacterial population where surviving bacteria enter a survival mode in which the energy used is destined to the repair of macromolecular damage lever et al 2015 morita 1997 the loss of culturability found at the temperature of 37 c in scw is consistent with previous studies which state that the survival of microorganisms including mesophiles follows an inverse relationship with the increase in temperature in certain nutrient starved environments arana et al 2010 bravo et al 2016 price and sowers 2004 low temperatures appear to be beneficial to prolong the persistence of these bacterial populations under starvation conditions arana et al 2010 bravo et al 2016 this temperature dependent pattern of resistance to starvation stress could be explained by the fact that temperature regulates the energy required by microorganisms to maintain essential physiological functions tijhuis et al 1993 regardless of the physiological state of the microorganisms or the amount of nutrients available in the surrounding environment price and sowers 2004 in other words at lower temperatures metabolic activity slows down favouring cell survival in suboptimal situations arana et al 2010 bravo et al 2016 lever et al 2015 rollins and colwell 1986 energy requirements for survival are cell and species specific lever et al 2015 and for this reason the survival differences observed between staphylococcal and enteric e coli or enterococcus sp microorganisms are not surprising enteric bacteria might use the endogenous constituents more slowly which is an advantage for survival in situations of such hostility lever et al 2015 morita 1997 the spring waters were a more adverse environment for the survival of pathogens presumably conditioned by the presence of indigenous flora as has been described elsewhere ducluzeau et al 1984 korhonen and martikainen 1991 leclerc and moreau 2002 lechevallier and mcfeters 1985 ramalho et al 2001 vachee et al 1997 the resident microbiota would explain the loss of culturability of the pathogens inoculated into the pure and into the filtered water and the favourable survival rate found in the autoclaved water or even the different behaviour of the microorganisms in both types of spring waters as has been reported each nmw is a unique environment characterized by the diversity and abundance of autochthonous bacterial flora adapted to its physicochemical peculiarities belkova et al 2007 hegler et al 2012 mathur et al 2007 this means the metabolic processes and the end products of the resident microbiota metabolism will be specific to that water thus each nmw will affect the survival of colonizing pathogens in a different way benefiting them by either cross feeding or inhibiting their growth mahajan and balachandran 2017 mathur et al 2007 thomashow 1997 in microhabitats with intense microbial interaction such as spring water environments bacteria often produce biocide compounds that enhance competence in the shared microbial niche mahajan and balachandran 2017 thomashow 1997 vachee et al 1997 the study by ducluzeau et al ducluzeau et al 1984 already hypothesized that the antagonistic effect of nmw on the survival of pathogenic species such as e coli was due to an accumulation of inhibitory substances released by the microbiota in the surrounding environment vachee et al demonstrated that siderophore production in combination with bacteriocin like compounds is the mechanism that largely contributes to the inhibitory growth effect of enteric and staphylococcal strains in nmws vachee et al 1997 in addition it is known that indigenous bacteria in oligotrophic environments have developed adaptation mechanisms to escape starvation such as nutrient transport systems with increased affinity or transport systems for alternative nutrients leclerc and moreau 2002 that could give them a major advantage over mesophilic bacteria to compete for nutrient resources for this reason and in agreement with previous reports korhonen and martikainen 1991 lechevallier and mcfeters 1985 ramalho et al 2001 the culturability of enteric and staphylococcal strains in our study was lower in pure than in filtered waters moreover this would explain the more favourable survival rate found in tollox spring waters nmw1 where the load of indigenous bacteria and consequently the metabolite content were significantly lower in comparison to nmw2 importantly the particular hydrochemistry of spring water could play an important role in the osmotic integrity of microorganisms in suspension since semipermeable cytoplasmic membranes only allow water and a limited number of solutes to cross record et al 1998 the loss of culturability seen in aws devoid of indigenous flora with respect to the isotonic scw medium at the temperature of 37 c strongly supports this argument and reinforces our group s previous observation that the mineralization content of nmws has an impact on the survival of pathogenic microorganisms serrano et al 2012 on the other hand the fact that bacterial tolerance to environmental stress persists in the aws at the temperature of 22 c suggests that the mechanisms that protect against starvation provide cross protection against osmotic stress csonka 1989 jenkins et al 1990 and as occurs with starvation stress the osmotic shock is also dependent on the temperature of incubation this stress cross protection was clearly present in enteric bacteria that better tolerate the environmental conditions proposed by scw and aws irrespective of incubation temperature it should be noted that the antimicrobial response of the aws was at any rate the result of both starvation and the osmotic stress of these waters although the specific contribution of each adverse condition in the suppression of bacterial growth remained unknown for this reason to better understand the specific role of the biotic and abiotic components of nmws in the microbial response we estimated the net effect attributed to these components by subtracting the scw effects since this water was characterized by the strictest nutrient deprivation and a negligible effect due to osmotic stress this meant assuming the worse setting possible to quantify the contribution of the biotic and abiotic components to the effect of nmw since starvation was probably less demanding in aws and especially in aw2 because they had the support of carbon sources from the inactivation of microorganisms after autoclaving starvation stress in aw1 was expected to be similar to scw at 37 c since at this temperature indigenous flora was absent this approach revealed that temperature modulated the impact of the biotic and abiotic components in the antimicrobial response of nmws mineral content contributed notably to the response at the temperature of 37 c compensating for the lesser effect of the biotic components at this temperature in comparison with the role of the primary contributor to the nmws effect at lower temperatures this is explained by the fact that the temperature of 37 c also had a profound effect on the diversity and abundance of water microbiota leclerc and moreau 2002 mathur et al 2007 and consequently on the evolution of the bacterial community in both types of nmws and particularly in nmw2 this is not surprising since both nmws emerge from their groundwater sources at temperatures close to 22 c and as a result autochthonous bacteria are better adapted to growth at lower temperatures finally it is important to note that a similar survival rate for allochthonous bacteria is expected in the tollox nmw1 and allange nmw2 facilities both nmws are very low thermal waters and the therapeutic procedures involving water treatments in their respective spas are performed within the range of temperatures used in this in vitro survival assay in addition a bottle effect leclerc and moreau 2002 during water confinement in the facilities is assumed our results could explain by extension the few reported outbreaks linked to nmw spas despite their significant exposure to bacterial contamination of human origin moreover since the chemical properties of nmws are well defined in the local policies and regulations for the protection and exploitation of natural spa water directive96 70 ec these results could be used to predict the risk of water contamination in these spas at least for the species tested in this study in conclusion the biotic autochthonous flora and abiotic mineral content components of nmws self preserve the quality of water and ultimately its properties by preventing the progression of human pathogenic organisms that can occasionally cause water colonization the relative influence of each component on the suppression of growth of colonizing microorganisms seems to be strongly modulated by environmental temperature these properties should be confirmed in further studies in order to explore the applicability of nmws in the clinical practice as an alternative treatment for the control of mucosal colonization such as that of oral mucosa by human pathogens 5 funding this work was supported by fundación mutua madrileña grant number

6939,in order to assess the role of the biotic and abiotic components of natural mineral water nmw in the spread of allochthonous bacteria in non thermal spa facilities we examined the effect of low mineralized nmws on the growth of several commensal and pathogenic human strains these nmws were collected from two spanish spring spas and had different microbiological characteristics microorganisms were exposed to untreated filtered and autoclaved nmws at the temperatures of 22 c and 37 c for 2 days mimicking the early stage of starvation starvation stress was controlled by the effect identified after incubation in saline changes in culturability after exposure were used as a measure of the water s antibacterial effect the specific biotic and abiotic effect of nmws on the suppression of bacterial growth was estimated after excluding the bacterial response to starvation stress characteristic of this natural oligotrophic environment the incubation temperature strongly modulated both the consequences of starvation and the impact of the natural biotic and abiotic components of nmws on the growth of commensal and pathogenic bacteria a temperature of 22 c conferred cross protection of microorganisms to starvation and nmw abiotic stress whereas a temperature of 37 c decreased the tolerance to both and had a negative influence on the abundance and diversity of nmws microflora this temperature dependent behaviour of the allochthonous and autochthonous bacteria explained the different culturability of microorganisms after exposure to untreated nmws at 22 c 1 2 4 log colony forming units per ml cfu ml mean reduction and at 37 c 1 8 3 2 log cfu ml mean reduction discarding the effect of starvation we estimated that the antibacterial effect of nmws at the temperature of 22 c was mainly driven by the microecosystem of nmws which explained 95 of nmw response in contrast at optimal temperatures for the growth of commensal and pathogenic microorganisms 60 of the antibacterial response of nmws was associated with the abiotic components of nmws the biotic and abiotic components of nmws self preserve the quality of water preventing the progression of human pathogenic organisms that can occasionally cause water colonization the influence of the intrinsic components of nmws on the suppression of microbial growth is strongly modulated by environmental temperature keywords natural mineral water allochthonous bacteria pathogenic antibacterial effect microflora temperature 1 introduction natural spa therapy hydrotherapy balneotherapy and climatotherapy is a non pharmacological and popular approach widely used in european countries which involves natural mineral waters nmws to treat various illnesses including rheumatological diseases morer et al 2017 tenti et al 2015 a recent systematic review that combined data from 27 double blind randomized controlled trials reported on the effectiveness of mineral bathing or mineral mud application in rheumatology patients supported the co benefit of simultaneous pharmacological and spa treatments and demonstrated a clear alternative to conventional pharmacology in cases of drug intolerance morer et al 2017 the mineral component of nmws has been proposed as the main mechanism to explain the beneficial effect of spa therapy morer et al 2017 tenti et al 2015 nmws originate mainly from intermediate aquifers and retain the physicochemical and microbiological characteristics found in the natural source leclerc and moreau 2002 the microbial ecosystem of nmws is of great complexity contains high phenotypic and genetic diversity a high number of bacterial genera casanovas massana and blanch 2012 loy et al 2005 rittershaus et al 2013 vachee et al 1997 and varies widely even among springs within close proximity casanovas massana and blanch 2012 mathur et al 2007 this variability is explained by the fact that the phylogenetic diversity of autochthonous bacteria is closely related to the predominant mineral chemistry of spring waters and vice versa belkova et al 2007 hegler et al 2012 mathur et al 2007 the autochthonous microflora of nmws contributes significantly to the chemical composition of water through the biologically controlled mineralization process of surrounding environments belkova et al 2007 furthermore this microflora has a notable influence on the control of the microbial diversity of nmws via cross feeding and competing mechanisms mahajan and balachandran 2017 mathur et al 2007 thomashow 1997 as microbiologically wholesome water leclerc and moreau 2002 nmw cannot be subjected to any treatment or additions to preserve its essential constituents and microbiological characteristics and ultimately its beneficial effects directive96 70 ec thus natural spas are prone to contamination by a great variety of allochthonous bacteria including commensal and pathogenic organisms of fecal coliforms and enterococci and non fecal pseudomonas sp and staphylococci human origin hlavsa et al 2015 serrano et al 2012 willke et al 2009 however few outbreaks linked to natural spring water have been reported mainly caused by e coli hlavsa et al 2015 willke et al 2009 the limited transmission and spread of microbial infections could be related to the reduced survival of human pathogenic bacteria under the harsh conditions found in nmws ohno et al 2003 pianetti et al 2008 it is important to note that natural sources of nmws are oligotrophic environments which as in the case of autochthonous flora must have developed adaptation mechanisms in order to survive for long periods of time under nutrient deprivation leclerc and moreau 2002 in these hostile environments a common survival strategy for bacteria is to enter a physiological state of starvation survival in which the energy requirements are extremely low morita 1997 the oligotrophic bacterial ecosystem of nmws also plays an important role in the survival of pathogenic bacteria ducluzeau et al 1984 korhonen and martikainen 1991 leclerc and moreau 2002 lechevallier and mcfeters 1985 ramalho et al 2001 vachee et al 1997 this ecosystem combined with the physicochemical properties of nmws could exert a certain influence on the spread of pathogens in these environments giampaoli et al 2013 serrano et al 2012 in this respect a recent study by our group has reported a direct relationship between mineralization levels and the survival of pathogenic bacteria in nmws serrano et al 2012 to fill the gap in our knowledge about the influence of the living biotic and non living abiotic components of nmw ecosystem in the survival of microorganisms in this study commensal and pathogenic human bacteria which can be released by human contact into spring spas e coli enterococci and staphylococci were exposed for a short period of time to two nmws with different microbiological and chemical characteristics therefore the role of these biotic and abiotic components in the preservation of microbiological quality of waters of natural spas will be assessed 2 material and methods 2 1 strains three control strains staphylococcus aureus atcc 25923 sa staphylococcus epidermidis atcc 35984 se and escherichia coli atcc 25922 ec as well as three clinical isolates s aureus sac from complicated skin and soft tissue infections e coli ecc and enterococcus faecalis efc from patients with urinary tract infections were used the strains were stored at 70 c in skim milk and were subcultured on columbia agar plates becton dickinson and co bd detroit mi three times before each experiment 2 2 water samples the natural mineral waters used were collected from two spring spas with different climatic and geochemical characteristics located in the south tolox nmw1 and in the west alange nmw2 of spain table 1 nmw samples were aseptically obtained in autumn in gamma irradiated 1 l polypropylene flasks and kept in the dark to prevent photochemical reactions samples were refrigerated on site and were immediately transported to the microbiology laboratory for processing nmw aliquots were filtered labelled as fw1 and fw2 through 0 2 µm pore size membranes in order to remove indigenous flora and to preserve the mineral content and the metabolic products of the natural micro ecosystem additional nmw aliquots were autoclaved labelled as aw1 and aw2 at 121 c for 21 min to kill microbial content and to inactivate any virtually present metabolites or bacteriocins water ph remained unchanged after autoclaving ensuring that the mineral content was preserved water filtration and sterilization were carried out in the laboratory the day before use sterile distilled deionized water from a direct q 5 uv system merck kgaa darmstadt germany supplemented with 0

school of medical hydrology school of medicine universidad complutense 2 3 autochthonous bacterial counts one hundred ml of nmw were incubated at 22 c and 37 c for up to 7 days within 48 h of sampling from spas after 0 1 2 and 7 days samples of 50 µl were plated in parallel onto reasoner s 2a agar plates bd using a spiral platter workstation don whitley scientific shipley uk and incubated for 2 days at 37 c and for 21 days at 22 c reasoner and geldreich 1985 prior to colony counting this procedure was also performed using fws and aws to ensure sample sterility all experiments were performed on three separate occasions results were expressed as colony forming unit per ml cfu ml the detection limit of this procedure was 20 cfu ml 2 4 experimental survival curves survival assays were carried out in flasks containing 100 ml of nmw aw fw or scw tempered at room temperature 20 c until they were inoculated with 1 ml of a standard suspension of the microorganism prior to the experiments three to four colonies of each microorganism from a fresh culture of columbia agar bd were grown overnight 16 20 h in an orbital shaker 100 r p m at 37 c in tryptic soy broth tsb bd bacteria were harvested by centrifugation 3 000 g for 10 min washed three times in nmw fw aw or scw and spectrophotometrically adjusted gbc model cintra 101 braeside australia to a standardized inoculum of 1 x 108 cfu ml this procedure ensures the removal of trace amounts of nutrient from the culture media one millilitre of this standard suspension was incorporated into a flask to reach an initial density of 1 x 106 cfu ml flasks were incubated for 2 days at 22 c and at 37 c all experiments were repeated three times samples collected after an incubation of 0 1 and 2 days were serially diluted in 0 9 sodium chloride and spiral plated onto agar media samples from aw fw and scw were simultaneously plated onto columbia agar bd and onto selective growth media for pathogenic bacteria manitol salt agar bd macconkey agar bd and bacteroides bile esculin agar bd were used as selective media for the recovery of staphylococci e coli and e faecalis respectively samples from pure nmw were plated onto r2a agar columbia agar and onto selective growth media columbia agar and selective media plates were incubated at 37 c for 2 days for colony counting r2a agar plates were incubated according to the incubation temperature of former flasks at 37 c for 2 days or at 22 c for 21 days complete recovery of microorganisms was achieved on selective media as judged by viable counts detected on the columbia agar plates in nmw samples when they appeared autochthonous bacteria were partially inhibited in the selective media the count of the autochthonous bacteria in the r2a agar from the nmw samples was carried out after discarding the number of inoculated microorganisms according to the morphological aspect of the colonies grown 2 5 measurement of the effects of water the change in the number of culturable bacteria in log10 cfu ml after two days of water exposure with respect to the initial inocula was used as a measure of the water s effect on the inoculated microorganisms bacterial counts from selective media were used for all water tested the biotic and abiotic effects of nmws were estimated for all strains using the reduction in the number of culturable bacteria obtained in the different waters the abiotic effect ae was calculated as aw effect swc effect the biotic effect was calculated as the sum of bp effect related to biocide products c bacterial competition where bp was the fw effect ae and c was the nmw effect bp 2 6 statistical analysis the comparison of the effect of the waters at the temperature of 22 c or 37 c and between both temperatures was performed by the two tailed t test or by the analysis of variance anova using the tukey test for multiple comparisons as needed 3 results 3 1 autochthonous bacteria in modified and pure spring waters as shown in fig 1 the basal abundance and the growing pattern of autochthonous bacteria in the uninoculated nmws were markedly different and dependent on the temperature of incubation basal counts were significantly higher at 22 c than at 37 c for nmw2 3 0 0 5 and 1 4 0 5 log10 cfu ml respectively p 0 01 counts for nmw1 were below the detection limit 1 3 log10 cfu ml regardless of the incubation temperature the bacterial load recovered from day 2 onwards was also higher at 22 c than at 37 c on days 2 and 7 counts increased by 0 83 log cfu ml and 1 27 log cfu ml p 0 01 for nmw1 samples and 1 25 log cfu ml p 0 01 and 2 74 log cfu ml p 0 01 for nmw2 samples at 22 c with respect to those at 37 c large differences in bacterial diversity were also observed at both temperatures based on the morphology of the colonies grown on r2a agar in nmw2 11 and 3 distinct species contributed to the bacterial load recovered at 22 c and 37 c respectively throughout the experiment the microbial diversity in nmw1 was lower in comparison to nmw2 with only four types of different organisms identified at 22 c on the inoculated nmws autochthonous bacteria counts were similar to those detected on the uninoculated samples throughout the microorganism exposure irrespective of the strain type of water or temperature of incubation assayed indicating that the presence of the commensal or pathogen bacteria had no effect on the survival of autochthonous flora fig 2 shows the comparative quantification of autochthonous flora in the inoculated and uninoculated waters after two days of exposure autochthonous bacteria were not detected in either fws or aws irrespective of the incubation temperature 3 2 effect of modified and pure spring waters on culturability of microorganisms the effect expressed as the log cfu ml reduction of bacterial count with respect to the initial inocula of commensal and pathogenic strains after 2 days under nutrient deprivation scw or exposure to modified aws and fws or pure nmws at the temperatures of 22 c and 37 c is summarized in tables 2 and 3 in scw bacterial counts for all strains remained constant or slightly increased throughout the experiment with respect to the initial inocula at the temperature of 22 c whereas at 37 c the bacterial burden decreased for all strains mean reduction 1 log unit indicating that temperature influenced the culturability of microorganisms under starvation the decline in bacterial counts at 37 c with respect to 22 c range from 0 11 to 2 58 log10 units was strains dependent and significant for all staphylococcal strains modified and pure spring waters had a greater effect on the reduction of culturability regardless of the incubation temperature tables 2 and 3 the highest reduction in the number of culturable bacteria was found in both nmws and this decreased gradually in fws and aws as the biological components subtracted from the nmw ecosystem increased the suppression of growth on modified and pure spring water followed the same temperature dependent pattern of exposure response described in swc at the temperature of 22 c nmws significantly reduced culturable bacteria compared to scw or aws for most strains nmw1 p 0 01 for sa and sac and p 0 05 for se and ec nmw2 p 0 01 for all strains except for efc indicating that the biological components of nmws are crucial in the final inhibitory effect of spring waters aws and scw did cause similar effects on microorganisms however at the temperature of 37 c aws exposure caused a dramatic fall in culturability compared with scw for some strains aw1 p 0 01 for sa and sac and p 0 05 for ec aw2 p 0 01 for sa and sac and p 0 05 for efc probably owing to the synergistic effect of nutrient deprivation and some components preserved in the autoclaved waters at this temperature nmws significantly reduced the bacterial load with respect to scw p 0 01 for all strains except efc on nmw1 and interestingly the differences in the culturability between aws and nmws decreased nmw1 p 0 01 for se nmw2 p 0 05 for ec this was explained by the fact that temperature had a different influence on the effect of modified and pure nmws the high temperatures substantially enhanced the effects of aws on microorganisms aw1 p 0 01 for sa se sac and ec aw2 p 0 01 for sa se and sac and p 0 05 for ecc and efc but had little impact on the effects of nmws by comparison and in particular of nmw2 nmw1 p 0 01 for staphylococcal species and p 0 05 for ecc nmw2 p 0 01 for efc and p 0 05 for ecc and sac comparing both types of waters modified and pure nmw2 resulted in a more adverse environment for survival than the homologous nmw1 regardless of temperature no significant differences were found between aws 0 11 and 1 78 vs 0 00 and 2 34 log unit drop at 22 c and 37 c for aw1 and aw2 respectively or fws 0 40 and 1 76 vs 0 78 2 64 log unit drop in contrast the exposure to nmw2 1 00 and 2 12 vs 2 45 and 3 24 log unit drop in mean counts at 22 c and 37 c for nmw1 and nmw2 resulted in significantly reduced cfu compared to those obtained in nmw1 for 3 strains p 0 05 sa and p 0 01 ec and ecc at 22 c and 5 strains p 0 05 sa sac ecc and efc and p 0 01 ec at 37 c individual antimicrobial responses obtained in the different waters were used in a subsequent analysis to estimate the direct effect of the abiotic and biotic components of nmw1 and nmw2 in the suppression of growth of microorganisms after discarding the resulting effects of starvation stress comparable starvation effects were assumed in swc nmw1 and nmw2 the interplay between temperature and the estimated effects of the biotic and abiotic constituents of nmws is shown in fig 3 as seen the contribution of aws compounds ae in the response was negligible 1 7 to 4 9 of total mean effects for nmw1 and nmw2 respectively compared to the effects related to the bacterial ecosystem bp and c of each water type at the temperature of 22 c instead aws compounds contributed largely to nmws effects at 37 c 70 1 and 60 8 of total mean effects for nmw1 and nmw2 respectively which was linked to the detrimental effect of increased temperature on the abundance and diversity of bacterial flora in each nmw and particularly in nmw2 4 discussion while the physicochemical properties and physiological effects of nmws are well known by comparison the study of factors involving the survival of allochthonous bacteria in this complex aquatic environment has received less attention abiotic factors such as temperature have a profound influence on the size and diversity of the ecosystem of nmws mathur et al 2007 and similarly the living biotic and non living abiotic intrinsic components of nmw influence the progression of colonizing allochthonous bacteria in agreement with previous studies our work confirmed the influence of temperature on the ability of pathogenic bacteria to survive in aqueous nutrient deprived environments arana et al 2010 bravo et al 2016 price and sowers 2004 and interestingly both the biotic the microbial ecosystem and the abiotic components of nmws the mineral chemistry are decisive factors to explain the loss of culturability of allochthonous bacteria at least in the early stages of starvation moreover our results also demonstrate that the relative impact of biotic and abiotic factors on the growth of allochthonous bacteria is modulated by temperature we found that the culturability of pathogenic bacteria under stringent nutrient deprivation scw was strongly influenced by temperature and that in the face of this environmental hostility the survival of commensal and pathogenic microorganisms improves at temperatures below the optimum growth temperatures for mesophilic organisms the tolerance to stressful scw conditions seen at the temperature of 22 c is the result of the initial adaptive response of microorganisms that occurs at the beginning of nutrient deprivation kurath and morita 1983 which due to the energy from the endogenous metabolism of cellular constituents accumulated under conditions of nutrient excess is sufficient for the maintenance of physiological functions but not to achieve a sustained growth if the deprivation of nutrients persists this physiological state of maintenance results in a significant reduction of the bacterial population where surviving bacteria enter a survival mode in which the energy used is destined to the repair of macromolecular damage lever et al 2015 morita 1997 the loss of culturability found at the temperature of 37 c in scw is consistent with previous studies which state that the survival of microorganisms including mesophiles follows an inverse relationship with the increase in temperature in certain nutrient starved environments arana et al 2010 bravo et al 2016 price and sowers 2004 low temperatures appear to be beneficial to prolong the persistence of these bacterial populations under starvation conditions arana et al 2010 bravo et al 2016 this temperature dependent pattern of resistance to starvation stress could be explained by the fact that temperature regulates the energy required by microorganisms to maintain essential physiological functions tijhuis et al 1993 regardless of the physiological state of the microorganisms or the amount of nutrients available in the surrounding environment price and sowers 2004 in other words at lower temperatures metabolic activity slows down favouring cell survival in suboptimal situations arana et al 2010 bravo et al 2016 lever et al 2015 rollins and colwell 1986 energy requirements for survival are cell and species specific lever et al 2015 and for this reason the survival differences observed between staphylococcal and enteric e coli or enterococcus sp microorganisms are not surprising enteric bacteria might use the endogenous constituents more slowly which is an advantage for survival in situations of such hostility lever et al 2015 morita 1997 the spring waters were a more adverse environment for the survival of pathogens presumably conditioned by the presence of indigenous flora as has been described elsewhere ducluzeau et al 1984 korhonen and martikainen 1991 leclerc and moreau 2002 lechevallier and mcfeters 1985 ramalho et al 2001 vachee et al 1997 the resident microbiota would explain the loss of culturability of the pathogens inoculated into the pure and into the filtered water and the favourable survival rate found in the autoclaved water or even the different behaviour of the microorganisms in both types of spring waters as has been reported each nmw is a unique environment characterized by the diversity and abundance of autochthonous bacterial flora adapted to its physicochemical peculiarities belkova et al 2007 hegler et al 2012 mathur et al 2007 this means the metabolic processes and the end products of the resident microbiota metabolism will be specific to that water thus each nmw will affect the survival of colonizing pathogens in a different way benefiting them by either cross feeding or inhibiting their growth mahajan and balachandran 2017 mathur et

niche mahajan and balachandran 2017 thomashow 1997 vachee et al 1997 the study by ducluzeau et al ducluzeau et al 1984 already hypothesized that the antagonistic effect of nmw on the survival of pathogenic species such as e coli was due to an accumulation of inhibitory substances released by the microbiota in the surrounding environment vachee et al demonstrated that siderophore production in combination with bacteriocin like compounds is the mechanism that largely contributes to the inhibitory growth effect of enteric and staphylococcal strains in nmws vachee et al 1997 in addition it is known that indigenous bacteria in oligotrophic environments have developed adaptation mechanisms to escape starvation such as nutrient transport systems with increased affinity or transport systems for alternative nutrients leclerc and moreau 2002 that could give them a major advantage over mesophilic bacteria to compete for nutrient resources for this reason and in agreement with previous reports korhonen and martikainen 1991 lechevallier and mcfeters 1985 ramalho et al 2001 the culturability of enteric and staphylococcal strains in our study was lower in pure than in filtered waters moreover this would explain the more favourable survival rate found in tollox spring waters nmw1 where the load of indigenous bacteria and consequently the metabolite content were significantly lower in comparison to nmw2 importantly the particular hydrochemistry of spring water could play an important role in the osmotic integrity of microorganisms in suspension since semipermeable cytoplasmic membranes only allow water and a limited number of solutes to cross record et al 1998 the loss of culturability seen in aws devoid of indigenous flora with respect to the isotonic scw medium at the temperature of 37 c strongly supports this argument and reinforces our group s previous observation that the mineralization content of nmws has an impact on the survival of pathogenic microorganisms serrano et al 2012 on the other hand the fact that bacterial tolerance to environmental stress persists in the aws at the temperature of 22 c suggests that the mechanisms that protect against starvation provide cross protection against osmotic stress csonka 1989 jenkins et al 1990 and as occurs with starvation stress the osmotic shock is also dependent on the temperature of incubation this stress cross protection was clearly present in enteric bacteria that better tolerate the environmental conditions proposed by scw and aws irrespective of incubation temperature it should be noted that the antimicrobial response of the aws was at any rate the result of both starvation and the osmotic stress of these waters although the specific contribution of each adverse condition in the suppression of bacterial growth remained unknown for this reason to better understand the specific role of the biotic and abiotic components of nmws in the microbial response we estimated the net effect attributed to these components by subtracting the scw effects since this water was characterized by the strictest nutrient deprivation and a negligible effect due to osmotic stress this meant assuming the worse setting possible to quantify the contribution of the biotic and abiotic components to the effect of nmw since starvation was probably less demanding in aws and especially in aw2 because they had the support of carbon sources from the inactivation of microorganisms after autoclaving starvation stress in aw1 was expected to be similar to scw at 37 c since at this temperature indigenous flora was absent this approach revealed that temperature modulated the impact of the biotic and abiotic components in the antimicrobial response of nmws mineral content contributed notably to the response at the temperature of 37 c compensating for the lesser effect of the biotic components at this temperature in comparison with the role of the primary contributor to the nmws effect at lower temperatures this is explained by the fact that the temperature of 37 c also had a profound effect on the diversity and abundance of water microbiota leclerc and moreau 2002 mathur et al 2007 and consequently on the evolution of the bacterial community in both types of nmws and particularly in nmw2 this is not surprising since both nmws emerge from their groundwater sources at temperatures close to 22 c and as a result autochthonous bacteria are better adapted to growth at lower temperatures finally it is important to note that a similar survival rate for allochthonous bacteria is expected in the tollox nmw1 and allange nmw2 facilities both nmws are very low thermal waters and the therapeutic procedures involving water treatments in their respective spas are performed within the range of temperatures used in this in vitro survival assay in addition a bottle effect leclerc and moreau 2002 during water confinement in the facilities is assumed our results could explain by extension the few reported outbreaks linked to nmw spas despite their significant exposure to bacterial contamination of human origin moreover since the chemical properties of nmws are well defined in the local policies and regulations for the protection and exploitation of natural spa water directive96 70 ec these results could be used to predict the risk of water contamination in these spas at least for the species tested in this study in conclusion the biotic autochthonous flora and abiotic mineral content components of nmws self preserve the quality of water and ultimately its properties by preventing the progression of human pathogenic organisms that can occasionally cause water colonization the relative influence of each component on the suppression of growth of colonizing microorganisms seems to be strongly modulated by environmental temperature these properties should be confirmed in further studies in order to explore the applicability of nmws in the clinical practice as an alternative treatment for the control of mucosal colonization such as that of oral mucosa by human pathogens 5 funding this work was supported by fundación mutua madrileña grant number
