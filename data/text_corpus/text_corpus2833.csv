the effect of functionalization of nanoadsorbents on certain key properties such as surface area separation and adsorption capacity we have compiled enormous data based on the characteristic properties of nanomaterials and their selective affinity towards certain heavy metal ions the experimental factors like ph adsorbent dosage contact time temperature initial ion concentration and ionic strength affecting metal ion removal have also been explored besides the different adsorption kinetics and adsorption isotherm models are discussed with the help of various illustrations to have an insight into the adsorption procedure keywords nanosorbents functionalization adsorption capacity contaminants adsorption kinetics adsorption isotherm 1 water pollution some reviews and discussion 1 1 heavy metal pollution a rapid increase in world s human population natural disasters exhaustion of water resources due to erratic climatic changes have led to scarceness of hygienically safe drinking water in various developing nations of the world in addition the presence of heavy metal ions such as pb ii cr vi mn ii ni ii as v cd ii hg ii etc which are extremely noxious water pollutants impose serious side effects in living organisms segregation of unprocessed industrial and household waste containing contaminants creates huge menace to the aquatic ecosystem by deteriorating the quality of surface and ground water and causes rigorous damaging and ill effects on the existing flora and fauna in addition to this prolonged excessive intake of heavy metal ions could damage kidney liver brain function and nervous system 1 some of these heavy metal ions become carcinogenic and even lethal when their concentrations exceed threshold limits different heavy metals are discharged into waste water by the effluent runoffs of various industries like fertilizers paints metal fabrication pigments leather batteries alloying electroplating mining etc 2 3 this leads to accumulation of non biodegradable heavy metal ions in the food chain at every level through biomagnification resulting in heavy metal poisoning of living organisms amongst the trace metals pb ii is considered to be the most toxic element which causes severe health issues in kids below six years such as less iq attention deficit disorders learning disabilities behavioural problems retarded growth and impaired hearing 4 hg ii is creating threat to mankind because of its toxicity constant existence in the environment and organisms as well as bio amplification and accretion in the food chain 5 as ii is a carcinogen which has been proved to be toxic in human beings through inhalation as well as ingestion 6 1 2 sources toxicity and hazardous effects table 1 presents the summarized data of common heavy metal ions their sources harmful effects and permissible limits in drinking water recommended by world health organisation who 1 3 methods for heavy metal ion remediation increasing demand of pure water with low concentration of heavy metals makes it obligatory to effectively eliminate poisonous heavy metals from industrial runoffs prior to their release into the ecosystem 115 various conventional techniques are accessible for the decontamination of waste water viz reverse osmosis 13 ion exchange 14 chemical precipitation 15 solvent extraction 16 etc even though the above mentioned approaches are efficient and achieve the discharge standards however most of them generate secondary waste adsorption therefore is believed to be a promising choice for the exclusion of noxious metals from waste water because of its accessibility versatility and high proficiency 8 the adsorption on the surface of solid adsorbents demonstrates a great perspective for the treatment of heavy metal ion contaminated water it is more advantageous than other methods owing to its simple design and low investment in terms of initial cost and space required 17 21 further the adsorption process becomes highly cost effective if the adsorbent used is recyclable due to these properties adsorption process is gaining a great deal of attention from researchers in the treatment of industrial waste water contaminated with heavy metal ions ideally an adsorbent should provide sufficient binding sites for appropriate adsorption of heavy metal ions main conventional adsorbents used for heavy metal ion elimination are activated carbon metal oxides clay etc to name a few 116 117 these traditional adsorbents suffer from certain constraints such as low adsorption capacities lack of functional tunability reusability and recyclability to overcome such limitations new sorbents in nano dimensions are being synthesized and adopted for water decontamination nowadays a considerable attention has been drawn by nanomaterials as the adsorbents in decontamination of wastewater due to their large specific surface area lesser flocculent production and availability of large number of active groups for binding of heavy metal ions 22 23 furthermore nanostructured adsorbents can be reused and recycled repeatedly which makes them cost effective and highly attractive but their inconstancy inconvenience in removal from treated water and their regeneration has restricted their commercial use 115 therefore researchers are aiming to resolve these issues by functionalization of nps this involves their coating with inorganic materials 24 polymers 8 25 carbon 26 biomolecules 27 etc appropriate surface functionalization enhances the adsorption capacity and provides more facile separation this review comprises of three sections in the first focus is on the use of various categories of nanoadsorbents like metal metal oxide magnetic chitosan polymer carbon zeolite etc for the efficient elimination of heavy metal ions from the waste water through adsorption process the second section describes the effect of various parameters i e ph adsorbent dose contact time temperature and initial ion concentration on the elimination of heavy metal ions finally in the third section kinetics and adsorption isotherms of heavy metal removal have been summarized 2 nanoadsorbents for heavy metal removal general overview advantages limitations and applications various types of nps viz metallic bimetallic metal oxide magnetic ferrite chitosan polymer based carbonaceous zeolite etc have been studied in the previous years for purification of wastewater contaminated with heavy metal ions these nanomaterials mainly remove the heavy metal ions by adsorbing them on their surfaces following is the detailed description of diverse types of nps demonstrated in the scientific investigations in recent times for the above mentioned purpose 2 1 metal and metal oxide based nanoadsorbent synthesis and functionalization in the past few years metallic and metal oxide nps fig 1 have emerged as an encouraging material in heavy metal ion removal bare metallic nps are less commonly used as adsorbent because they tend to agglomerate due to their instability in addition to this separation of bare nps from waste water is a complicated process therefore there is a need of capping or functionalization of these nanostructured adsorbents to enhance their stability and to make the separation process easy among the metallic nps fe0 i e nano zero valent iron nzvi is of immense significance due to its high stability greater surface area non toxicity reducing nature and higher adsorption capacity several investigations in literature illustrate the use of nzvi for heavy metal ion removal in a study by xiao et al 28 iron based nps were synthesized from fecl3 using syzygium jambos sja the synthesized biogenic sja fe nps were found to be highly effective in elimination of cr vi with maximum removal capacity 983 2 mg g in a similar study removal of as v by synthetic nzvi was demonstrated by kanet et al 29 with 99 removal capacity further the stability of these nzvi can be improved by their entrapment or functionalization with some stabilizing agent sikder et al 30 entrapped nzvi in a non toxic and biodegradable stabilizer i e chitosan carboxymethyl β cyclodextrin complex the synthesized material was used for the complete removal of cr vi and cu ii which involves physisorption followed by reduction of cr vi to cr iii and also cu ii to cu 0 whilst oxidizing fe0 to fe iii as illustrated in fig 2 subsequently bimetallic nps have also been used for the heavy metal ion removal as reported in literature in this respect cai et al 31 synthesized bimetallic fe ni nps embedded in kaolinite k fe ni these fe ni nps were effective for the simultaneous elimination of cu ii and no3 with removal efficiency of 99 7 and 40 4 respectively in addition to metallic nps numerous scientific investigations have been carried out by different research groups to demonstrate the role of metal oxide nps in waste water decontamination fig 1 based upon their inherent magnetic character these have been classified as magnetic and non magnetic metal oxide nps among non magnetic nps oxides of zn ce al fe cu mn etc have been utilized for heavy metal ion removal for example gupta et al 2016 and verma et al 2017 32 22 23 synthesized cuo nps using magnetron sputtering for the removal of noxious cr vi and pb ii ions from waste water with adsorption capacities of 15 62 mg g and 37 02 mg g respectively another cost effective nps i e volcanic rock with the α fe2o3 coating were used for the effective adsorption of cd ii ions 10 with maximum adsorption capacity of 146 41 mg g at 30 c nanofibrous adsorbent α fe2o3 was investigated for the elimination of cr vi from wastewater with 16 17 mg g removal capacity 33 similarly hallaji et al 34 synthesized a nanofiber adsorbent based on zno coated with polyvinyl alcohol pva fig 3 a for the adsorption of cu ii ni ii and u vi ions with maximum adsorption capacity toward u vi followed by cu ii and ni ii the order of removal of these ions can be explained on the basis of the fact that the attraction of an adsorbent for a particular ion is related to atomic mass electronegativity and ionic radii 35 atomic mass follows the sequence u vi 238 02 g mol cu ii 63 54 g mol ni ii 58 69 g mol on the other hand electronegativity is in the order of u vi 1 38 cu ii cu ii 1 90 and ni ii 1 91 ionic radii are in the order of u vi 156 pm cu ii 128 pm ni ii 124 pm therefore an obvious relation can be established between the properties of metal ions and the sequence of adsorption because of high ionic radii greater atomic mass and lower electronegativity pva zno nanofiber adsorbed more u vi ions as compared to cu ii and ni ii ions yari et al 2 demonstrated the use of nanofiber based on ceo2 coated with vinylpyrrolidone and 3 mercaptopropyltrimethoxysilane pvp ceo2 tmptms fig 3b for the adsorption of cu ii and pb ii ions which depicted better adsorption affinity for pb ii as compared to cu ii similarly polyacrylonitrile pan and polypyrrole ppy coated mno2 nanofiber pan ppy mno2 was used as an adsorbent for the elimination of pb ii ions which showed better adsorption capacity of 251 89 mg g 36 than above mentioned nanofiber pvp ceo2 tmptms which was 90 9 mg g sounthararajah et al 37 synthesized another nanofibrous material using sodium titanate for adsorption of multiple ions i e cu ii cd ii ni ii pb ii and zn ii ions from water the adsorption investigations were carried out both for single and mixed metal systems which illustrated the better adsorptive removal of individual metal as compared to mixed metal system the reason behind this can be the interionic competition for adsorption besides transition metal oxide nps some alkaline metal oxide nps has also been used for the elimination of heavy metal ions these are believed to be relatively less toxic and eco friendly as compared to above mentioned metal oxide nps mgo nps are important members of this group which have been studied by various researchers and observed to be competent for the elimination of heavy metal ions for example cao et al 38 developed flowerlike mgo nps with high surface area and exhibited excellent removal efficiency towards pb ii and cd ii with maximum capacities of 1980 mg g and 1500 mg g respectively a different mechanism of adsorption based on cation exchange between mg ii ions from mgo nps and pb ii or cd ii was proposed which lead to the high adsorption capacities in another study mgo nps were used for the decontamination of waste water along with simultaneous bacterial disinfection the prepared mgo nps showed good removal efficiency for cd ii and pb ii ions along with escherichia coli e coli inactivatio 106 2 1 1 alumina based nanoadsorbent synthesis and functionalization another imperative metal oxide alumina al2o3 occurs in natural soils and has numerous structural phases namely α β ɤ ɵ and χ 39 40 in conventional methods α al2o3 is being utilized as a natural adsorbent possessing greater stability 41 42 alumina with strong interatomic bonding is a popular sorbent because it possesses intriguing properties i e its thermal conductivity compressive strength wear and corrosion resistance and electrical insulation are quite high 43 recent studies have illustrated the ability of al2o3 nps to boost the adsorption performance of certain nanomembranes in this context ghaemi 44 employed al2o3 nps to enhance the removal efficiency of polyethersulfone pes membranes toward copper here pes nano membrane was impregnated with different doses of al2o3 nps it was noticed that the uptake of metal ions increases by increasing the nps content in membrane matrix hojamberdiev et al 43 impregnated dithizone dtz and 2 amine 1 methyl benzimidazole mab in the pores of spent al2o3 catalyst the adsorption efficiencies of dtz al2o3 and mab al2o3 were determined by the sorption of ni ii cd ii and zn ii from water the highest adsorption capacities for ni ii 0 37 mmol g 1 zn ii 0 54 mmol g 1 and cd ii 1 01 mmol g 1 were noted for mab al2o3 the sorption of these heavy metal ions on mab al2o3 was due to physisorption and chemical reaction between metal ions and the mab al2o3 surfactant functionalization of metal oxides results into enhanced adsorption performance since most of metal oxide nanoparticles have a tendency to agglomerate which results into decrease in surface area therefore modification of the surface of metal oxide with surfactant has emerged as a successful method for improving the adsorption capacity of nanoadsorbent in this context adsorption performance of sodium dodecyl sulphate sds modified alumina i e al2o3 sds towards nh4 i ions was investigated by pham et al 45 authors observed that surface modification of alumina with sds induces a significant increase in removal efficiency due to change in surface charge resulted by coating of anionic surfactant in another report nguyen et al 46 illustrated the use of both sodium tetra decyl sulphate sts and sds modified ɤ alumina nanoparticles for the efficient removal of cd ii the authors investigated the effect of surfactants on the adsorption of cd ii ion and the removal efficiency was found to be significantly enhanced from 67 to 94 6 2 1 2 silica based nanoadsorbent synthesis and functionalization silica based nanomaterials another category of metal oxide nanoadsorbents possess great potential in metal ion adsorption due to their unique characteristics like large surface area controllable surface properties and well defined pore size in addition to this nanosilica presents a non toxic and eco friendly adsorbent further the surface modification of nanosilica with amino and thiol functional groups result into increased adsorption capacity and selectivity li et al 47 modified silica gel with nitrilotriacetic acid nta silica gel for the efficient removal of cu ii cd ii and pb ii from waste water the synthesized material showed quick removal of metal ion within 2 to 20 min with adsorption capacities of 63 5 53 14 and 76 22 mg g 1 for cu ii cd ii and pb ii respectively in another report amino functionalized 3 aminopropyl and phenyl groups silica nanospheres were investigated for the enhanced removal of cu ii ions 48 the adsorption capacity was found to increase with increase in concentration of amino groups najafi et al 49 also gave insight to the comparative removal of cd ii ni ii and pb ii using three different amino functionalized silica nano hollow spheres nh2 snhs and non functionalized silica based nanomaterials i e nanosilica spheres and non functionalized snhs and amino functionalized nanosilica gel nh2 sg the adsorption capacity of functionalized nanosilica was found to be higher as compared to snhs and maximum adsorption capacities for cd ii ni ii and pb ii employing nh2 snhs were 40 73 31 39 and 96 79 mg g 1 respectively 2 2 magnetic nanoparticles mnps based nanoadsorbent synthesis and functionalization magnetic nanomaterials constitute a major category of advanced nanomaterials which combine advantages of magnetic separation and nanotechnology for the better heavy metal ion removal magnetic separation technique is being widely used in the case of ecological issues because the mnps exhibit brilliant reusability after magnetic separation the characteristics of these magnetic nanomaterials alter considerably with reduction in size the multi domain structure of magnetic material changes to single domain ensuing new magnetic properties non mnps have less surface area and are difficult to separate from the aqueous phase that limits their applicability in wastewater decontamination alternatively mnps have a comparatively greater surface area biocompatibility chemical inertness less toxicity and easy dispersion ability hence the application of mnps in the waste water treatment is more reliable efficient and cost effective various mnps have been used by the researchers for the effective removal of heavy metal ions nano sized iron oxide particles are an important member of this family these offer increased adsorption capacity rapid adsorption rate easy separation and renewal in this regard iconaru et al 50 synthesized magnetite nps nfe3o4 and compared their removal efficiency with commercial magnetite towards as ii and cu ii the results indicated the higher adsorption capacity of synthesized magnetite as compared to commercial magnetite in another study fe3o4 mnps prepared by giraldo et al 51 were examined for the adsorptive removal of pb ii cu ii zn ii and mn ii ions the adsorption capacity of fe3o4 nps towards pb ii was found to be maximum and for mn ii it was minimum this can be attributed to different hydrated ionic radii of these heavy metal ions which lead to variation in electrostatic interactions between heavy metal cations and negatively charged adsorption sites in another contribution fe3o4 nanoadsorbents were studied for the adsorptive removal of pb ii ions from waste water with adsorption capacity of 36 0 mg g 52 amongst the various nanostructures nanotubes nanowires and nanorods have greater specific area and exhibit high capacity to eliminate heavy metal ions from water in a study by karami 53 magnetite nanorods were used for the effective removal of fe ii pb ii zn ii ni ii cd ii and cu ii ions from waste water the maximum adsorption capacities were found to be 127 113 107 95 88 and 76 mg g 1 for fe ii pb ii zn ii ni ii cd ii and cu ii respectively generally bare mnps are prone to oxidation and are easily agglomerated in aqueous medium which restricts their practical application beside the significant developments in synthesis of mnps maintenance of their stability by preventing them from agglomeration and precipitation is an important issue to overcome these limitations bare mnps can be functionalized by different moieties surface modification of mnps increases adsorption capacities and stability towards oxidation with enhanced selectivity towards a particular metal ion functionalization provides complex formation chemical binding and ligand combination in addition to electrostatic and van der waals interactions liable for the metal ion adsorption on the surface of adsorbent 54 55 functionalization using charged functional groups alters the charge on nanoadsorbent surface which results into enhanced electrostatic interactions between metal ions and the surface of adsorbent these improved electrostatic interactions are responsible for adsorption selectivity further surface functionalization of mnps with hydrophilic coating using polyethylene glycol peg poly vinyl alcohol pva and poly vinyl pyrollidine pvp as capping agents prevent them from agglomeration it leads to larger surface area to volume ratio and increases the homogeneity of mnps into the solution manipulation of properties of mnps by tailoring their surfaces results into selective adsorption of heavy metal ions type of surface functionalization and the geometric array of coating molecules decide the overall size and surface area of mnps which play an important role in enhanced and selective adsorption of heavy metal ions from waste water many investigations have been carried out for the functionalization of mnps with various materials like polymers organic inorganic biomolecules carbonaceous materials etc 2 2 1 polymer functionalized mnps polymers have also been used for the surface modification of mnps to obtain higher adsorption capacities polymeric support provides a number of advantages for nps functionalization such as better chemical stability high mechanical strength and bio compatibility many scientists have illustrated the use of polymers in combination with mnps fig 4 which improves the mechanical and thermal properties of polymer for example magnetic nanocomposite particles mncps fabricated with iminodiacetic acid grafted poly glycidylmethacrylate maleic anhydride pgma man copolymer were reported by hasanzadeh et al 8 the authors illustrated the efficiency of these mncps for the decontamination of water containing pb ii and cd ii ions similarly martínez cabanas et al 25 presented another polymer functionalized iron oxide mnps where chitosan was used as a polymer for the effective adsorption of as v a green approach has been used for the synthesis of above mentioned nanomaterial where iron oxide nps have been prepared using plant extract of eucalyptus the investigations revealed that iron oxide nanoparticle beads are an efficient as v adsorbent with small equilibrium times and excellent adsorption capacity at natural ph in another study mnps modified with hydroxyapatite mnhap were tested for the adsorptive removal of cd ii and zn ii 56 another polymeric mercaptoethylamino coated mnps mamnps were presented by madrakian et al 57 the experimental results demonstrated that mamnps showed high tendency towards the removal ag i hg ii pb ii and cd ii huang and chen 58 demonstrated the use of a new magnetic nanoadsorbent fabricated by the functionalization of fe3o4 nps with polyacrylic acid paa and diethylenetriamine deta for the adsorption of cu ii and cr vi the higher adsorption capacity was calculated for cu ii ions as compared to cr vi ions 2 2 2 biomolecules functionalized mnps functionalization of mnps with biomolecules enables their safe and eco friendly use in metal ion remediation process in addition to increased adsorption capacity many researchers investigated the use of biomolecule functionalized mnps in heavy metal ion adsorption in a contribution by verma et al 22 23 glycine modified magnetic fe3o4 nps gf mnps enclosed in alginate polymer in the form of beads were used where the adsorbent demonstrated excellent removal efficiency for pb ii ions owing to the amino and carboxylate groups on the surface of beads another adsorbent containing iron oxide mnps and ca alginate embedded on the surface of a biomass strain i e phanerochaete chrysosporium pellets was prepared by xu et al 59 for effective removal of pb ii with adsorption capacity 167 36 mg g in some reports substituted cellulose a biopolymer has also been used for functionalization of mnps fan et al 60 synthesized carboxy methyl cellulose immobilized fe3o4 mnps cmc fe3o4 which exhibit high adsorption capacity 152 0 mg g 1 of pb ii ions the results indicated that chelation as well as electrostatic attraction was responsible for the removal of pb ii by cmc fe3o4 this can be attributed to fact that cmc chains on the surface of mnps possess various functional groups which were responsible for the complexation with pb ii ions further the adsorption mechanism was based on electrostatic interactions between the ions and mnps surface which is positively charged when ph is below zero point charge zpc leading to reduced adsorption capacity and at ph higher than zpc increased adsorption capacity was observed in another study mnps modified with triazinyl β cyclodextrin t β cd mnps prepared by abdolmaleki et al 61 displayed superb adsorption performance towards pb ii cu ii zn ii and co ii the enhanced adsorption capability was attributable to the presence of many hydroxyl and azinyl nitrogen groups in triazinyl β cyclodextrin on the surface of mnps maximum adsorption capacities were obtained in the order pb ii cu ii zn ii co ii the considerable difference in the adsorption efficiencies may be due to the different complexation ability of the oxygen and nitrogen groups on the surface of mnp with the metal ions the extent of metal ligand binding depends mainly on the metal ion and its inclination to form ionic or covalent bonds 2 2 3 organic molecules functionalized mnps organic molecules provide various functional groups for the complexation with heavy metal ions which greatly enhance the adsorption capacity of mnps ge et al 62 fabricated acrylic acid aa and crotonic acid ca grafted fe3o4 mnps modified with 3 aminopropyltriethoxysilane aptes for the removal of heavy metal ions in the given order pb ii cu ii zn ii cd ii the difference is ascribed to the different complex capacity of the carbonyl with the metal ions amino functionalized magnetic nanoadsorbents mnps nh2 were also found to be effective in heavy metal ion elimination tan et al 63 demonstrated that amino functionalized fe3o4 nps displayed effective adsorptive removal toward pb ii ions similarly gao et al 64 functionalized mesoporous superparamagnetic fe3o4 nps with a chelating ligand i e triethylenetetramine these functionalised mnps have been illustrated for the removal of copper in waste water with 85 removal efficiency similarly shen et al 65 explored the mechanism of adsorption of cr vi on the surface of nanosized magnetic polymer functionalized with tetraethylene pentamine i e tepa nmps experimental data confirmed the adsorption of cr vi on these nmps due to the electrostatic interaction and also because of the reduction of cr vi into cr iii through charge transfer on the adsorbent surface in another category shen et al 66 synthesized a number of core shell fe3o4 nps functionalized with various multi amino groups i e nh2 nmps for the adsorption of cu ii and cr vi ions in sole metal ion system and co existing metal ion system the adsorption process was found to be highly dependent on ph of the medium for both cu ii and cr vi ions it was due the fact that adsorption process was mainly based on electrostatic interactions adsorption capacities were maximum at ph values between 2 4 at ph lower than 2 protonation of nh2 to nh3 results into lesser availability of nh2 binding sites which reduces adsorption efficiency at ph higher than 2 greater availability of nh2 binding sites results into increase in adsorption of cu ii ions on the other hand at ph above 4 precipitation of cu ii occurs similarly adsorption of cr iv i e hcro4 was maximum at ph 2 4 due to electrostatic attractions between hcro4 and nh3 higher ph declines adsorption capacity because of competition between hcro4 and oh ions further it was observed that adsorption process was competitive at higher concentration of metal ions and low ph values in coexisting system lower concentrations and higher ph values did not affect the adsorption efficiencies of coexisting systems liu et al 67 synthesized cost effective and environment friendly humic acid ha coated fe3o4 nps for the sorption of hg ii pb ii cd ii and cu ii the results depicted the improved stability and adsorption capacity of fe3o4 ha as compared to fe3o4 nps 2 2 4 carbonaceous material functionalized mnps furthermore functionalization of mnps with carbonaceous materials like graphene oxide go and activated carbon is also an effective method to improve the adsorption efficiency of nanoadsorbents for example magnetite graphene oxide lauric acid la nanocomposite containing ethylenediamine tetra acetic acid edta nps go fe3o4 la edta prepared by danesha et al 26 was used for the sorption of pb ii ions strong coordination ability of edta and the presence of cooh and oh on go surface resulted in their enhanced electrostatic interactions with metal ions which improved adsorption performance in another study magnetite nps modified with powder activated carbon i e fe3o4 c were used as an adsorbent for pb ii 68 another highly effective fe3o4 nps functionalized with edta were fabricated by ghasemi et al 69 for the adsorption of ag i hg ii mn ii zn ii pb ii and cd ii ions with adsorption efficiencies and adsorption capacities in the range of 96 104 and 71 169 mg g respectively 2 2 5 inorganic molecules functionalized mnps inorganic compounds like silica and edta have also been employed for the functionalization of mnps in the metal removal application with regard to this different wt of fe3o4 nps was modified with silica metformine and amine by ghaemi et al 70 the results depicted the highest cu ii removal about 92 for 0 1 wt metformine modified silica coated fe3o4 mnps due to high affinity in cu ii adsorption an effective nanoadsorbent mnps modified with silica and glutathione fe3o4 sio2 gsh mnps was successfully synthesized by xu et al 71 and subsequently applied for pb ii removal the prepared nanosorbents were consistent in size and offered abundant adsorption sites for pb ii also their super paramagnetic character helped their easy removal with the external magnet the maximum pb ii adsorption capacities were found to increase with the increase in temperature similarly mokadem et al 72 investigated the use of mnps modified with 1 2 3 triazole mnp trz and silica coated mnps trz in the elimination of metal ions with adsorption capacities in the order pb ii cu ii zn ii the observed sequence is the consequence of electronic properties of atoms of the ligand and metal ion characteristics which control the process of complexation higher the metal ionic potential greater will be its inclination to attract electrons of the ligand and thus the complex formed will be maximum stable 73 for cations with the same charge the stability of complexes tends to decrease with increase in ionic radii the hydrated ions sizes of the metal increased follows the sequence pb ii 4 01 a cu ii 4 19 a zn ii 4 30 a 74 in another scientific investigation girginova et al 5 used mnps coated with silica which were modified with dithiocarbamate groups silica coated mnps were observed to be highly efficient in the elimination of hg ii even at very low concentrations carbonate based adsorbents constitute another category of promising materials to functionalize mnps caco3 is an economical non toxic porous material with a large solubility product which remarkably improves the metal ion adsorption capacity of the adsorbents by facilitating precipitation reactions between caco3 and heavy metal ions however a few disadvantages such as low efficiency sludge generation and difficult separation restrict their use in waste water purification to overcome these technical problems caco3 can be combined with mnps for better separation from waste water and high adsorption capacity islam et al 24 synthesized mesoporous needle like magnetic adsorbent iron oxide caco3 io caco3 using hydrothermal method this adsorbent was used for the removal of as v cr vi and pb ii at a greater rate than any conventional adsorbents previously reported 2 2 6 nanocomposite mnps researchers have also explored magnetic nanocomposites of different metal oxides as nanosorbents in this respect flower shaped fe3o4 mno2 nanocomposite was synthesized by kim et al 75 the adsorbent displayed a significantly enhanced adsorption capacity for cd ii cu ii pb ii and zn ii than fe3o4 nps another important category of magnetic nanomaterials is metal ferrite nps where any metal is coupled with ferrite molecules to acquire the property of magnetic separation metal ferrite in general is represented as m fexoy where m denotes any metal which makes divalent bonds in a series of investigations mn zn ferrite mn0 67zn0 33fe2o4 76 copper ferrite cufe2o4 and znfe2o4 77 78 nps were synthesized for heavy metal ion elimination mn zn ferrites were employed for removing as v cd ii and pb ii with high removal efficiencies subsequently copper ferrite and zinc ferrite nps were used for the recovery of mo ii and pb ii from water respectively babadi et al 79 synthesized nanocomposite of nife2o4 salensi where nife2o4 nps were functionalized with a schiff base derived from salicylaldehyde and amino propyl triethoxy silane the synthesized nanocomposite was used for the adsorptive removal of ni ii from aqueous solution with 95 adsorption efficiency 2 3 polymer based nanoadsorbent synthesis and functionalization polymer based nanofibrous membranes have also been employed as the core substance of the adsorbents due to their well defined porous nature greater gas permeability minute interfiber pore size and large specific surface area which leads to their enhanced adsorption efficiency these possess high skeletal strength adjustable surface functional moieties and easily degradable properties which makes them a perfect choice for potential adsorbents membrane adsorption process on the surface of polymeric nanofibers involve adsorption of metal ions on functional groups of incorporated sorbent in the nanomembrane and permeation of waste water through membrane the presence of special functional groups like nh2 cooh so3h etc further enhance the adsorption capacity and selectivity of polymer based nanomembrane polymer based nanoadsorbents can be further categorised on the basis of material used 2 3 1 chitosan nps chitosan is a hydrophilic non toxic eco friendly and biocompatible polymer which can form complexes with various metal ions the presence of amino groups facilitates the interaction with metal ions through chelation and chemical modifications of chitosan further enhance its selectivity and sorption capacity further its sorption efficiency can be improved by linkage with various substances which lead to stabilization of chitosan in acidic medium and augment its mechanical properties for example dubey et al 7 synthesized chitosan alginate nps canps for adsorption of hg ii ions from water due to positive and negative ions of chitosan and alginate respectively they interact electrostatically with both the tripolyphosphate ions and calcium ions a remarkably high value of maximum adsorption capacity i e 217 39 mg g at 30 c of canps for hg ii ions was obtained in this study esmaeili and khoshnevisan 80 investigated the effectiveness of alginate functionalized chitosan nps alg cs nps for elimination of ni maximum removal of ni was observed to be 94 8 in this case in another study chitosan tio2 nanocomposites were synthesized by razzaz et al 2016 9 for the absorptive removal of cu ii and pb ii ions saad et al 81 fabricated core shell zno chitosan nps for the elimination of heavy metal ions in the order pb ii cd ii cu ii yuan et al 82 synthesized a series of 3d hierarchically porous nitrogen doped carbon materials hnc by using chitosan as a source of carbon nitrogen source the results indicated that hnc exhibits strong adsorption capacity for pb ii and cd ii in aqueous solution the authors also proposed that adsorption of pb ii on hnc is a chemisorption process caused by coordination and electrostatic interaction between the pb ii ions and n and o containing functional groups of hnc materials a similar kind of material i e chitin has also been employed for the adsorptive removal of heavy metal ions liu et al 83 synthesized chitin nanofibrils cnf by downsizing chitin micro particles cmp with no alteration in its chemical and structural properties the synthesized cnf were used for the elimination of heavy metal ions in order of cd ii ni ii cu ii zn ii pb ii cr iii the adsorption capacity values were observed to be greater than cmp because of larger specific surface area and extensive porosity of cnf 2 3 2 dendrimer nanoadsorbent organic polymeric sorbents containing chelating functional groups are another potential nanomaterial for the elimination of metal cations these consist of chelating functional groups and the polymer matrix or support in this context hasanzadeh et al 84 fabricated poly styrene alt maleic anhydride with 3 aminobenzoic acid further this chelating resin was modified by 1 2 diaminoethane or 1 3 diaminopropane for the adsorptive removal of heavy metal ions with percent removal in the order of fe ii cu ii zn ii pb ii in a similar study nanofibrous poly ethylene co vinyl alcohol evoh were synthesized 85 for cr vi adsorption from water the equilibrium time for adsorption was less than 100 min and the adsorption capacity was 90 74 mg g in another scientific report polyacrylonitrile pan nanofibers modified with amidoxime groups were applied for the adsorption of cu ii and pb ii ions 86 pan mof 808 nanofibers membranes were prepared by co electro spinning of polyacrylonitrile pan polymer and metal organic frameworks i e mof 808 and then investigated for scavenging pb ii cd ii zn ii and hg ii ions from an aqueous solution 108 the order of removal efficiency among these ions is zn 54 cd 50 pb 46 hg 34 taking into account the ionic radius of heavy metal ions the order is zn ii 0 74 å cd ii 0 95 å hg ii 1 02 å pb ii 1 19 å 87 the removal efficiency decreases as the ionic radius increases except for the interchanging positions of pb ii and hg ii this implies that steric effect of the ions prevents the approach of heavy metal ions to the adsorption site in another contribution cegłowski et al 88 synthesized two novel economical polymeric nanoadsorbents by the reaction of diethylenetriamine deta or pentaethylenehexamine peha with 1 3 5 tris 6 isocyanatohexyl 1 3 5 triazinane 2 4 6 trione hdi ic the obtained hdi ic deta and hdi ic peha polymers have varying ethyleneamine chain lengths because of which they can form polyamine chelating complexes with heavy metal ions the hdi ic peha exhibited approximately two times greater maximum adsorption capacities for cd ii co ii cr iii and cu ii ions as compared to hdi ic deta due to the presence of longer ethyleneamine chains martín et al 89 selected polyacrylonitrile pan as base polymer to prepare three ion selective nanofibers from ethylenediamine eda ethyleneglycol eg or diethylenetriamine dta the adsorption capacity values for cu ii pb ii and zn ii obtained in this study are 6 1 8 8 and 7 2 mmol g 1 respectively which are exceptionally higher are as compared to other materials this may be due to the large surface area of the nanofibers and their high degree of surface functionalization resulting in a greater number of chelating groups accessible for metal adsorption another study by shah et al 90 reports an efficient removal of cd ii ni ii cu ii and co ii with a low cost superadsorbent polymer hydrogel sph prepared from acrylic acid and acrylamide in various ratios all the compositions showed significant ability to adsorb the above mentioned heavy metal ions from aqueous medium the scientific investigation indicated greater selectivity of sph for co ii and cu ii relative to cd ii and ni ii which may be attributed to the fact that the metals smaller in size can easily penetrate in the polymer matrix and subsequently adsorb on the vacant site functionalized in the polymer chain 2 3 3 cellulose based nanoadsorbent adsorbent based on biopolymers such as cellulose have also been investigated for the elimination of heavy metal ions mautner et al 91 modified cellulose nanofibrils cnf with phosphate groups by reacting cnf with phosphoric acid p to synthesize cnf p it was found that these cnf p nanopapers adsorbed cu ii ions efficiently from aqueous solutions another highly promising bio absorbent in three different forms i e tetramethyl piperidine oxide tempo oxidized 2 3 6 tricarboxy cellulose nanofiber t cnfs and tpc cnfs with and without polyamide amine epichlorohydrin crosslinker pae was synthesized by abou zeid et al 111 for scavenging heavy metal ions such as cu ii pb ii and ca ii from waste water it was observed that cu ii and pb ii ions were the highest adsorbed ions 92 23 97 34 and 82 19 mg g for t cnfs tpc cnfs and crosslinked tpc cnfs respectively 2 4 zeolite nps in past years zeolites are being comprehensively utilized for the separation and remediation processes due to their high porosity alkali and alkaline earth metals can be moved in their framework to balance negative charge between si iv and al iii but in current times zeolites are being used in np form which is more efficient for adsorption because they have large specific surface area and surface activity in one report polysulfone psf membrane imbued with zeolite nps was used where adsorption and the filtration processes were coupled for the dynamic removal of pb ii and ni ii ions 93 the maximum adsorption capacity of the impregnated membrane for pb ii and ni ii was calculated to be 682 and 122 mg g respectively another scientific study by deravanesiyan et al 94 illustrated the adsorption of cr iii and co ii ions using alumina nps immobilized zeolite aniz the removal capacity of this new sorbent was compared with al2o3 nps and nax zeolite granules results revealed that the adsorption efficiency of zeolite has been considerably enhanced cr iii 31 76 co ii 17 2 on immobilizing al2o3 nps in another work polyvinyl alcohol pva nax nanozeolite adsorbent was fabricated and used for removal of ni ii and cd ii ions from aqueous medium the adsorption results indicated a higher affinity of pva zeolite nanofibrous adsorbent for cd ii ions than ni ii ions the adsorption capacities for cd ii were observed to be much higher than ni ii 95 2 5 carbon based nanomaterials new generation nanoadsorbents owing to the distinctive physical and chemical properties carbonaceous based functional materials have emerged as one of the most favourable nanoadsorbents they are attaining great attentsion of present researchers because of immense scope in treatment of waste water decontamination several endeavours to obtain a variety of carbon based nanostructures like carbon nanotubes cnts carbon based nanocomposites and graphene had been performed in the past for the removal of various kinds of pollutants among these cnts are more promising due to their large surface area small size cylindrical hollow structure and electrical conductivity basically cnts are of two main categories viz single walled swcnts and multi walled mwcnts various studies describe the use of cnts in heavy metal ion removal from waste water for example rahbari and goharrizi 96 described the adsorption of pb ii from water on cnts with adsorption capacity of 70 1 mg g similarly stafiej and pyrzynska 97 demonstrated the use of cnts for the adsorptive removal of ions with removal capacities in the order of cu ii pb ii co ii zn ii mn ii in another investigation oxidized multi walled carbon nanotube with coating of mno2 mno2 omwcnts were used for the efficient removal of cd ii ions from aqueous solution with adsorption capacity of 41 6 mg g 83 recently carbon layered silicate nanocomposites have triggered considerable research interest because of their improved properties as compared to their counterparts i e conventional carbonaceous materials in an investigation by zhu et al 98 an environmentally benign montmorillonite carbon mmt c adsorbent was fabricated for removal of pb ii with maximum adsorption capacity of 247 85 mg g graphene another member of carbon based nanomaterials has gained a significant attention in the field of environmental remediation the presence of oxygen containing functional moieties on graphene oxide go surface provides a strong hydrophilic nature to it which lead to its fine dispersion in water the distinctive functional groups and high surface area of go makes it a prospective candidate for the waste water decontamination these nanomaterials are effective against various pollutants present in waste water removal of heavy metal ions is based on the adsorption via complexation of metal ions with the oxide binding site in graphene the organic pollutants like dyes interact with delocalized π electron system of graphene fig 5 zhao et al 11 synthesized go nanosheets for the adsorptive removal of cd ii and co ii adsorption capacities of 106 3 and 68 2 mg g towards cd ii and co ii respectively were obtained in another scientific study 3d mno2 nanotubes reduced graphene oxide hydrogel mngh was prepared by zeng et al 99 these uniformly sized 20 nm mno2 nanotubes were wrapped by interconnected porous reduced graphene oxide rgo sheets the 3d porous nanostructure and the synergetic action between rgo and mnts of the hydrogel induced greater adsorption capacity for pb ii 356 37 mg g 1 cd ii 177 4 mg g 1 ag ii 138 2 mg g 1 cu ii 121 5 mg g 1 and zn ii 83 9 mg g 1 further the experimental conditions for the removal of metal ions using above mentioned nanoadsorbents have been summarized in table 2 3 separation of nanoadsorbent from reaction system reusablity of adsorbents is a significant factor for evaluating their viability in practical applications because an efficient repetitive availability of adsorbents will reduce the overall cost of the adsorption process there is variety of reports by the researchers demonstrating the different methods for the separation of adsorbent from the reaction system followed by reusability of the nanoadsorbent zeng et al 99 employed 0 5 m hno3 solution to recover pb ii from the mngh nanoadsorbent the adsorption capacities of pb ii decline to some extent with chronological cycles of reuse about 87 of its original adsorption capacity was retained even after eight reusability cycles therefore mngh exhibited immense ease for reusability in removing heavy metal ions in another scientific investigation polystyrene poly n isopropylmethacrylamide acrylic acid i e pst p nipmam aac core shell gel particles used for the removal of pb ii cu ii cd ii and cr iii ions were eluted with 0 5 m hcl solution in this case pb ii ions adsorption on these gel particles was maintained up to three repeated adsorption and desorption cycles but small decline in removal of cu ii cd ii and cr iii ions was noted in third cycle of reusability 101 the regenerative capacity of hnc 3 was evaluated by using diluted hno3 solution as desorbent the removal efficiency for pb ii ions is still maintained after the fifth cycle demonstrating the good reusability of hnc 3 these observations imply that the active sites on hnc 3 occupied by pb ii ions could be completely recovered by treating them with an acid this might be due to the competition for adsorption sites between h and pb ii 82 fan et al 60 examined the reusability of cmc fe3o4 for adsorption of pb ii ions by washing the nanoadsorbent with 0 1 m na2 hpo4 and water it was observed that there was a slight decrease in adsorption capacity with increasing adsorption and desorption cycles the adsorption capacity of cmc fe3o4 was found to be greater than 85 after five cycles the saturation magnetization of cmc fe3o4 after five cycles was found to be 45 0 emu g 1 which is approximately same as these nps before the adsorption experiment 45 5 emu g 1 these results predict that the cmc fe3o4 have tremendous reusability and stability making them valuable mnps for wastewater remediation in another study martín et al 89 examined the recovery of cu ii pb ii and zn ii ions from ion selective polyacrylonitrile nanofibers and assessed their reusability over four adsorption desorption cycles the excellent results were given by 1 0 m hno3 and 0 5 m h3po4 with more than 90 recovery for ions a steady behavior was noted for pb ii and zn s ii with no significant decline in the adsorption capacity suggesting that these nanofibers can be reused and recycled easily on the other hand the adsorption capacity decreased for cu ii ions with the adsorption desorption cycles 4 factors affecting adsorption scientific investigations have examined the effect of several factors viz ph adsorbent dose contact time temperature and initial ion concentration on heavy metal ion adsorption on the surface of nps herein we have reflected on the influence of the above mentioned factors on the adsorptive removal of heavy metal ions 4 1 effect of ph ph plays a key role in the whole adsorption process and particularly for the adsorption capacities therefore it is necessary to investigate its effect on the removal of metal ions in a scientific report it has been illustrated that on increasing the ph from 2 0 to 5 0 the adsorptive removal of hg ii ions by canps increases at low ph the electrostatic repulsions between the protonated functional moieties on the surface of canps and metal cations hinder their adsorption in addition to this the presence of a significant number of h and h3o ions in water compete with the metal ions for adsorption however at some moderate ph the rate of adsorption enhances because of reduction in electrostatic repulsions due to deprotonation of the active sites 7 various other investigations have also demonstrated that adsorption of heavy metal ions is favoured at moderate ph rather than at lower values for example adsorption of pb ii and cu ii on the surface of chitosan tio2 nanofibres reached the maximum values at ph 6 0 and were lowest from ph 2 0 to 4 0 9 in a similar study it was demonstrated that with increase in ph from 4 0 to 6 0 the percentage of adsorption of cd ii appreciably increased and then became constant 97 at ph 9 0 after that percentage of adsorption decreased to 80 on further increasing the ph to 11 0 75 the results of these investigations have been compiled in fig 6 a from the above discussion we can conclude that moderate ph is favourable for the removal of heavy metal ions because at this ph the sorbent surface gets deprotonated which leads to augmentation of the negatively charged sites this results into enhanced electrostatic attractions between the surface of adsorbent and metal cations which causes an increase in the adsorption capacity but at lower ph there is an increase in adsorption sites carrying positive charge which leads to increase in the repulsive forces among the adsorbent surface and the positively charged metal ions decreases the adsorption of metal ions 58 at higher ph hydroxylated complexes of the metal ions are formed which destroy the nanoadsorbent s surface leading to blockage of some active sites 4 2 effect of adsorbent dose it plays a major role in the adsorption process adsorption capacity for the removal of heavy metal ions depends upon the number of effective adsorption sites which increases with increase in adsorbent dose therefore the adsorption capacity enhances with the amount of adsorbent dose of nps but further increase in adsorbent dose results into agglomeration of nps decreased surface area and reduction in sorption sites thereby decreasing the adsorption capacity there are many investigations in literature demonstrating the influence of adsorbent dose on heavy metal ion adsorption for example the optimum concentration of nanofibrous chitosan coated with tio2 was 2000 mg l for the adsorption of pb ii and cu ii ions it was observed that at higher concentrations agglomeration of nps lead to partial deactivation of nanofiber surfaces as a consequence the adsorption capacity of adsorbent reduced significantly 9 a considerable in increase adsorption efficiency from 41 7 to 92 was observed on increasing fe3o4 c nanosorbent dosage from 0 5 to 2 g l however it lead to a reduction in adsorption capacity from 41 7 to 22 9 mg g the reason behind the improvement of removal efficiency is the ease of access of pb ii ions to the active sites on the fe3o4 c surface on the other hand reduced adsorption capacity with increase in adsorbent dose may result from the inter particle aggregation due to high adsorbent concentration which reduces the active surface area of fe3o4 c 68 these results have been presented graphically in fig 6b 4 3 effect of contact time the time of contact between the metal ion solution and nps plays a major role in economical wastewater treatment process it has been observed that with increase in contact time removal efficiency enhances which may be ascribed to the fact that interaction time between metal ions and active sites on nanoadsorbent increases further removal efficiency is fast during the initial stage and increases slowly thereafter this is primarily due to the accessibility of higher number of vacant sites on the adsorbent surface initially which subsequent decreases with time this kind of adsorption behaviour was illustrated in a study where the removal efficiency for hg ii on the canps surface enhanced on increasing the contact time from 0 to 90 min the increase in removal efficiency of hg ii was quick during the first 30 min then slowed down with the achievement of adsorption equilibrium in 90 min 7 in a similar study the adsorption of pb ii and cd ii on to mncps surface was observed to be 100 and 91 of the total adsorption 53 33 and 48 53 mg g within the initial 20 min of contact time respectively thereafter due to equilibrium between rate of adsorption and desorption the process became independent of contact time 8 some of these studies have been compared in fig 6c 4 4 effect of temperature solution temperature is also an essential parameter in adsorption process in general initial increase in the temperature reduces the solution viscosity which results in enhancement in the diffusion rate of the adsorbate molecules across the adsorbent surface and leads to elevated adsorption efficiency subsequent change in temperature can affect the adsorption process in two different ways depending upon whether the process involves absorption or evolution of heat the adsorption capacity decreases with increase in the temperature for an exothermic process whereas it increases in case of an endothermic one furthermore temperature study of an adsorption process provides significant information regarding various thermodynamic parameters i e the standard gibbs free energy δg enthalpy δh and entropy changes δs accompanying adsorption in a scientific investigation the adsorption of hg ii on canps was found to be exothermic the removal efficiency increased on raising the temperature from 10 c to 30 c and decreased thereafter with maximum adsorption approximately 79 40 at 30 c further decrease might be due to the increased mobility of metal ions with rise in temperature leading to desorption or de chelation of metal ions from adsorbent surface therefore the number of metal ions adsorbed on canps decreased on increasing the temperature moreover for exothermic adsorption process the electrostatic interactions between adsorbent and hg ii ions weaken at elevated temperature 7 the negative δg values and positive δh values predicted that sorption of metal ions on the surface of adsorbent was spontaneous and endothermic in another study adsorption of pb ii on fe3o4 nanoadsorbent surface at different temperatures was found to be endothermic there was an increase in pb ii adsorption efficiency on increasing the temperature which can be attributed to increase in ionic mobility which results into greater number of ions interacting with active sites 52 4 5 effect of initial ion concentration initially the rate of adsorption increases on increasing the concentration of metal ions up to a certain extent but further increase leads to a decrease in removal efficiency this might be due to the reason that for a fixed amount of adsorbent an optimum concentration of metal ion should be present in the solution at low concentration lesser number of metal ions will be available for the adsorption which leads to low removal capacity but if concentration is increased the number of ions available for the adsorption increases which results in higher adsorption rate but beyond a certain initial concentration there is the greater availability of ions for same number of adsorption sites which consequently reduces the removal efficiency for example on increasing the initial concentration of hg ii from 4 mg l to 12 mg l on the surface of canps enhances the adsorption rate which decreases subsequently 7 in a similar investigation the sorption capacity of pva zno nanofibrous adsorbent for u vi cu ii and ni ii ions increased with increasing initial concentrations of metal ions from 90 to 500 mg l 34 some of these results are presented in fig 6d 4 6 effect of ionic strength ionic strength of the aqueous solution plays an important role in adsorption process as it describes the effect of additional ions present in aqueous solution on the adsorption of adsorbate molecules on the surface of adsorbent generally it is studied by adding different concentrations of ions like na cl etc in adsorbate solution the extent of effect of strength of ions depends upon the screening of coulombic potential between adsorbent molecule and adsorbing ions and competition among the target ions and added ions for active sites on adsorbent surface the adsorption efficiency depends also gets affected by the concentration of added ions as well as adsorbent s affinity if adsorbent has higher affinity towards target metal ions as compared to added ions its adsorption efficiency is negligibly altered by the ionic strength of solution some reports in literature describe the negligible effect of ionic strength on the adsorption of heavy metal ions hasanzadeh et al 8 demonstrated the effect of nacl at 3 mol l concentrations on the adsorption of two heavy metal ions pb ii and cd ii on the surface of mncps it was observed that nacl has insignificant effect on the adsorption of heavy metal ions which proves that the adsorbent has higher affinity towards pb ii and cd ii than na ions in a study by xu et al 71 a slight increase in adsorption capacity of pb ii on fe3o4 sio2 gsh mnps was observed with addition of nacl at concentration of 0 025 mm but further increase in nacl concentration upto 0 2 mm lead to decrease in adsorption capacity from 98 87 to 85 72 mg g 1 this observation can be explained on the basis of the fact that initially nacl promotes the dissociation of functional groups on the surface of adsorbent enhancing the adsorption capacity later decrease was due to inter ionic competition for binding sites therefore it can be concluded that the effect of ionic strength can vary from negligible to considerable depending upon the nacl concentration as well as affinity of the adsorbent surface towards adsorbate molecules 5 strategies for evaluating metal ion adsorption by nps 5 1 adsorption kinetics kinetics describes the rate of adsorption process with respect to the effect of time and reactant concentration on the rate of reaction rate of adsorption process can be described by various kinetic models depending upon rate of solute uptake and reactant concentration most commonly used kinetic models to investigate the rate of adsorption process i e pseudo 1st order pseudo 2nd order intra particle diffusion model and double exponential model are discussed as follows linear form of integrated rate equation of pseudo 1st order and pseudo 2nd order model can be expressed as eqs 1 and 2 1 log q e q t l o g q e k 1 2 303 t 2 t q t 1 k 2 q e 2 1 q e t where qt is the adsorption capacity at time t qe is the adsorption capacity at equilibrium mg g k1and k2 are the rate constant of pseudo first order adsorption min 1 and pseudo 2nd order respectively t is the contact time min from the slope and intercept of the plot of log qe qt versus t pseudo 1st order k1 and qe can be determined respectively for pseudo 2nd order values of k2 and equilibrium adsorption capacity qe can be calculated from the intercept and slope of the linear plot of t qt versus t respectively intra particle diffusion model is based on weber and morris 105 theory which describes the multistep adsorption process involving transport of adsorbate molecules from the solution phase to the surface of the adsorbent molecules which is followed by transfer of molecules into the interior of the solid pores linear equation for this model is as eq 3 3 q t k i d t 0 5 c where qt is the adsorption capacity at time t t0 5 is the half life time in seconds kid mg g min0 5 is the rate constant of intraparticle diffusion and c is boundary thickness the values of kid and c are obtained from the slope and intercept of the linear plot of qt versus t0 5 recently to describe the adsorption of heavy metal ions two step mechanism is also considered the first step involves the rapid uptake of metal ions through external and internal diffusion further metal ion uptake slows down in the second step which finally reaches the equilibrium stage 104 the mechanism is diffusion controlled where kd1 min 1 and kd2 min 1 are diffusion parameters controlling overall kinetics this mechanism is also known as double exponential model which can be expressed as eq 4 4 q t q e d 2 m a d s e k d 2 t in eq 4 d1 and d2 are sorption rate parameters in mmol 1 for rapid and slow step respectively mads is mass of adsorbent g qt and qe are amount of metal ion adsorbed mg at time t min and equilibrium respectively eq 4 can be simplified by assuming the exponential term negligible which allows the determination of d2 and kd2 further knowing the values of d2 and kd2 the parameters d1 and kd1 can be obtained from the plot of linearised eq 5 5 ln q e q t d 2 m a d s e k d 2 t l n d 1 m a d s k d 1 t extensive reports are available in literature illustrating the applicability of different adsorption kinetic models on the metal ion adsorption on the surface of different nps some of them have been summarized below table 3 5 2 adsorption isotherms adsorption isotherms correlate the extent of adsorption of heavy metal ions with their concentrations at constant temperature to characterize adsorption mechanism langmuir freundlich temkin and dubinin radushkevich adsorption isotherms are used 107 langmuir model depicts the monolayer adsorption of the solute on adsorbent surface with fixed number of adsorption sites with equivalent affinity towards adsorbate molecules linear form of this model used to evaluate the data is given as eq 6 6 c e q e 1 q 0 b c 0 q 0 where qe amount of metal ion adsorbed mg g ce is equilibrium concentration mg l q0 is monolayer adsorption capacity mg g b is langmuir constant l mg related to the adsorption energy linear plot of ce qe versus ce give the values of with slope 1 q0 and intercept 1 q0b langmuir model does not give any idea about the heterogeneous adsorption and roughness of the adsorbent surface however freundlich model describes the multilayer adsorption and roughness of the adsorbent surface non uniform adsorption energies linear form of this model can be described by eq 7 7 l o g q e l o g k f 1 n l o g c e in eq 7 kf and n are freundlich constants related to heterogeneity and bonding energy respectively the value of n depicts the extent of deviation from linearity values of kf and n are determined from intercept and slope respectively from the plot of lnqe versus lnce temkin isotherm assumes the linear decrease in heat of adsorption for adsorbate molecules with increase in coverage owing to adsorbent adsorbate interactions moreover it describes the constant distribution of the bonding energies up to some maximum binding energy temkin isotherm is given by following equations 8 q e r t b l n a t r t b l n c e 9 b r t b t 10 q e b l n a t b l n c e where at is temkin isotherm equilibrium binding constant l g related to maximum binding energy bt is temkin isotherm constant r is universal gas constant 8 314 j mol k t is temperature at 298 k and b is constant related to heat of sorption j mol dubinin radushkevich drk isotherm model considers adsorption mechanism to involve gaussian energy distribution onto a heterogeneous surface this model is generally used to model the adsorption on carbon nanomaterials this theory gives better result than langmuir and freundlich isotherm for the adsorption of organic molecules on carbon nanotubes and carbon nanoparticles drk isotherm considers that surface curvature defects of adsorbent also play an important role in adsorption process as the flat surfaces allow more atoms to approach for adsorption and increase the rate of adsorption this model is fitted with high solute activities and the intermediate range of concentrations and can be represented as 11 q e q s e x p k a d 2 where qe is amount of adsorbate in the adsorbent at equilibrium mg g qs is theoretical isotherm saturation capacity mg g kad is dubinin radushkevich isotherm constant mol2 kj2 and ε is dubinin radushkevich isotherm constant which can be calculated as 12 ε r t l n 1 1 c e where r t and ce represent the gas constant 8 314 j mol k absolute temperature k and adsorbate equilibrium concentration mg l respectively this approach is usually applied to distinguish the physical and chemical adsorption of adsorbate with its mean free energy e e per molecule of adsorbate for removing a molecule from its location in the sorption space to the infinity can be computed by the relationship 13 e 1 2 b d r where bdr is denoted as the isotherm constant several studies based on adsorption of metal ions on the surface nps have been reported in literature some studies have been compiled in table 4 6 conclusion nanoscience and nanotechnology have witnessed great advancements in recent years which paved a way for the development of efficient economical and eco friendly approaches for environment remediation a variety of nanomaterials exhibit certain physicochemical properties that make them a promising candidate for wastewater purification the nanoparticles can remove heavy metal ions even at low concentration with additional benefit of high selectivity and adsorption capacity adsorption is extremely successful and simple physicochemical technique used for the extraction of heavy metals from wastewater in the present review we have studied various nanostructured materials such as metal metal oxide magnetic chitosan polymer based carbonaceous and zeolite used as adsorbents for elimination of heavy metal ions these materials are summarized in table 2 along with experimental conditions for metal ions removal furthermore the recent research is focused on the surface functionalization and modification of nps to improve their dispersion stability and separation from suspension medium various molecules like inorganic organic polymeric biomolecules etc are being used for the functionalization of nanoadsorbents the separation process can be made easy by providing magnetic character to the nanoadsorbents further the impact of variables such as ph of the solution adsorbent dosage temperature time initial concentration of metal ion and ionic strength of solution on adsorption process have also been summarized ph is identified as an important factor which highly affects the removal of cations from solution metal ions removal was observed to be maximum at moderate ph values rather than very low or high ph the adsorption capacity of the adsorbent depends upon the metal to binding sites ratio which explains the effect of adsorbent dose temperature also influences the adsorption process to a significant extent for an exothermic adsorption process the rate of adsorption decreases with rise in temperature whereas endothermic adsorption process leads to increased adsorption capacity at high temperature effect of contact time demonstrated that removal is rapid initially which slows down later at equilibrium similarly effect of initial ion concentration depicted that adsorption capacity of adsorbent increases initially with increasing metal ion concentration and decreases thereafter due to saturation of active sites of adsorbent 7 future perspectives the review concludes with the encapsulated projection of the fact that these nanomaterials have a great potential for use in heavy metal ions elimination from wastewater in future such article will provide multifaceted information regarding the researched subject matter to the future workers they will be able to obtain comparative and comprehensive information regarding the applicability of various types of nanoparticles in scavenging heavy metal ions from waste water as a result of which this article will provide not only the insight into various aspects explored by the earlier scientists but also help them design their own research problems taking into account the usability and implications of the research work in science as well as industries declaration of competing interest on behalf of all authors the corresponding author states that there is no conflict of interest 
14165,this review presents a holistic analysis of the synthesis and efficacy of nanosorbents towards the waste water purification by the removal of selected heavy metal ions with special emphasis on the effect of functionalization of nanoadsorbents on certain key properties such as surface area separation and adsorption capacity we have compiled enormous data based on the characteristic properties of nanomaterials and their selective affinity towards certain heavy metal ions the experimental factors like ph adsorbent dosage contact time temperature initial ion concentration and ionic strength affecting metal ion removal have also been explored besides the different adsorption kinetics and adsorption isotherm models are discussed with the help of various illustrations to have an insight into the adsorption procedure keywords nanosorbents functionalization adsorption capacity contaminants adsorption kinetics adsorption isotherm 1 water pollution some reviews and discussion 1 1 heavy metal pollution a rapid increase in world s human population natural disasters exhaustion of water resources due to erratic climatic changes have led to scarceness of hygienically safe drinking water in various developing nations of the world in addition the presence of heavy metal ions such as pb ii cr vi mn ii ni ii as v cd ii hg ii etc which are extremely noxious water pollutants impose serious side effects in living organisms segregation of unprocessed industrial and household waste containing contaminants creates huge menace to the aquatic ecosystem by deteriorating the quality of surface and ground water and causes rigorous damaging and ill effects on the existing flora and fauna in addition to this prolonged excessive intake of heavy metal ions could damage kidney liver brain function and nervous system 1 some of these heavy metal ions become carcinogenic and even lethal when their concentrations exceed threshold limits different heavy metals are discharged into waste water by the effluent runoffs of various industries like fertilizers paints metal fabrication pigments leather batteries alloying electroplating mining etc 2 3 this leads to accumulation of non biodegradable heavy metal ions in the food chain at every level through biomagnification resulting in heavy metal poisoning of living organisms amongst the trace metals pb ii is considered to be the most toxic element which causes severe health issues in kids below six years such as less iq attention deficit disorders learning disabilities behavioural problems retarded growth and impaired hearing 4 hg ii is creating threat to mankind because of its toxicity constant existence in the environment and organisms as well as bio amplification and accretion in the food chain 5 as ii is a carcinogen which has been proved to be toxic in human beings through inhalation as well as ingestion 6 1 2 sources toxicity and hazardous effects table 1 presents the summarized data of common heavy metal ions their sources harmful effects and permissible limits in drinking water recommended by world health organisation who 1 3 methods for heavy metal ion remediation increasing demand of pure water with low concentration of heavy metals makes it obligatory to effectively eliminate poisonous heavy metals from industrial runoffs prior to their release into the ecosystem 115 various conventional techniques are accessible for the decontamination of waste water viz reverse osmosis 13 ion exchange 14 chemical precipitation 15 solvent extraction 16 etc even though the above mentioned approaches are efficient and achieve the discharge standards however most of them generate secondary waste adsorption therefore is believed to be a promising choice for the exclusion of noxious metals from waste water because of its accessibility versatility and high proficiency 8 the adsorption on the surface of solid adsorbents demonstrates a great perspective for the treatment of heavy metal ion contaminated water it is more advantageous than other methods owing to its simple design and low investment in terms of initial cost and space required 17 21 further the adsorption process becomes highly cost effective if the adsorbent used is recyclable due to these properties adsorption process is gaining a great deal of attention from researchers in the treatment of industrial waste water contaminated with heavy metal ions ideally an adsorbent should provide sufficient binding sites for appropriate adsorption of heavy metal ions main conventional adsorbents used for heavy metal ion elimination are activated carbon metal oxides clay etc to name a few 116 117 these traditional adsorbents suffer from certain constraints such as low adsorption capacities lack of functional tunability reusability and recyclability to overcome such limitations new sorbents in nano dimensions are being synthesized and adopted for water decontamination nowadays a considerable attention has been drawn by nanomaterials as the adsorbents in decontamination of wastewater due to their large specific surface area lesser flocculent production and availability of large number of active groups for binding of heavy metal ions 22 23 furthermore nanostructured adsorbents can be reused and recycled repeatedly which makes them cost effective and highly attractive but their inconstancy inconvenience in removal from treated water and their regeneration has restricted their commercial use 115 therefore researchers are aiming to resolve these issues by functionalization of nps this involves their coating with inorganic materials 24 polymers 8 25 carbon 26 biomolecules 27 etc appropriate surface functionalization enhances the adsorption capacity and provides more facile separation this review comprises of three sections in the first focus is on the use of various categories of nanoadsorbents like metal metal oxide magnetic chitosan polymer carbon zeolite etc for the efficient elimination of heavy metal ions from the waste water through adsorption process the second section describes the effect of various parameters i e ph adsorbent dose contact time temperature and initial ion concentration on the elimination of heavy metal ions finally in the third section kinetics and adsorption isotherms of heavy metal removal have been summarized 2 nanoadsorbents for heavy metal removal general overview advantages limitations and applications various types of nps viz metallic bimetallic metal oxide magnetic ferrite chitosan polymer based carbonaceous zeolite etc have been studied in the previous years for purification of wastewater contaminated with heavy metal ions these nanomaterials mainly remove the heavy metal ions by adsorbing them on their surfaces following is the detailed description of diverse types of nps demonstrated in the scientific investigations in recent times for the above mentioned purpose 2 1 metal and metal oxide based nanoadsorbent synthesis and functionalization in the past few years metallic and metal oxide nps fig 1 have emerged as an encouraging material in heavy metal ion removal bare metallic nps are less commonly used as adsorbent because they tend to agglomerate due to their instability in addition to this separation of bare nps from waste water is a complicated process therefore there is a need of capping or functionalization of these nanostructured adsorbents to enhance their stability and to make the separation process easy among the metallic nps fe0 i e nano zero valent iron nzvi is of immense significance due to its high stability greater surface area non toxicity reducing nature and higher adsorption capacity several investigations in literature illustrate the use of nzvi for heavy metal ion removal in a study by xiao et al 28 iron based nps were synthesized from fecl3 using syzygium jambos sja the synthesized biogenic sja fe nps were found to be highly effective in elimination of cr vi with maximum removal capacity 983 2 mg g in a similar study removal of as v by synthetic nzvi was demonstrated by kanet et al 29 with 99 removal capacity further the stability of these nzvi can be improved by their entrapment or functionalization with some stabilizing agent sikder et al 30 entrapped nzvi in a non toxic and biodegradable stabilizer i e chitosan carboxymethyl β cyclodextrin complex the synthesized material was used for the complete removal of cr vi and cu ii which involves physisorption followed by reduction of cr vi to cr iii and also cu ii to cu 0 whilst oxidizing fe0 to fe iii as illustrated in fig 2 subsequently bimetallic nps have also been used for the heavy metal ion removal as reported in literature in this respect cai et al 31 synthesized bimetallic fe ni nps embedded in kaolinite k fe ni these fe ni nps were effective for the simultaneous elimination of cu ii and no3 with removal efficiency of 99 7 and 40 4 respectively in addition to metallic nps numerous scientific investigations have been carried out by different research groups to demonstrate the role of metal oxide nps in waste water decontamination fig 1 based upon their inherent magnetic character these have been classified as magnetic and non magnetic metal oxide nps among non magnetic nps oxides of zn ce al fe cu mn etc have been utilized for heavy metal ion removal for example gupta et al 2016 and verma et al 2017 32 22 23 synthesized cuo nps using magnetron sputtering for the removal of noxious cr vi and pb ii ions from waste water with adsorption capacities of 15 62 mg g and 37 02 mg g respectively another cost effective nps i e volcanic rock with the α fe2o3 coating were used for the effective adsorption of cd ii ions 10 with maximum adsorption capacity of 146 41 mg g at 30 c nanofibrous adsorbent α fe2o3 was investigated for the elimination of cr vi from wastewater with 16 17 mg g removal capacity 33 similarly hallaji et al 34 synthesized a nanofiber adsorbent based on zno coated with polyvinyl alcohol pva fig 3 a for the adsorption of cu ii ni ii and u vi ions with maximum adsorption capacity toward u vi followed by cu ii and ni ii the order of removal of these ions can be explained on the basis of the fact that the attraction of an adsorbent for a particular ion is related to atomic mass electronegativity and ionic radii 35 atomic mass follows the sequence u vi 238 02 g mol cu ii 63 54 g mol ni ii 58 69 g mol on the other hand electronegativity is in the order of u vi 1 38 cu ii cu ii 1 90 and ni ii 1 91 ionic radii are in the order of u vi 156 pm cu ii 128 pm ni ii 124 pm therefore an obvious relation can be established between the properties of metal ions and the sequence of adsorption because of high ionic radii greater atomic mass and lower electronegativity pva zno nanofiber adsorbed more u vi ions as compared to cu ii and ni ii ions yari et al 2 demonstrated the use of nanofiber based on ceo2 coated with vinylpyrrolidone and 3 mercaptopropyltrimethoxysilane pvp ceo2 tmptms fig 3b for the adsorption of cu ii and pb ii ions which depicted better adsorption affinity for pb ii as compared to cu ii similarly polyacrylonitrile pan and polypyrrole ppy coated mno2 nanofiber pan ppy mno2 was used as an adsorbent for the elimination of pb ii ions which showed better adsorption capacity of 251 89 mg g 36 than above mentioned nanofiber pvp ceo2 tmptms which was 90 9 mg g sounthararajah et al 37 synthesized another nanofibrous material using sodium titanate for adsorption of multiple ions i e cu ii cd ii ni ii pb ii and zn ii ions from water the adsorption investigations were carried out both for single and mixed metal systems which illustrated the better adsorptive removal of individual metal as compared to mixed metal system the reason behind this can be the interionic competition for adsorption besides transition metal oxide nps some alkaline metal oxide nps has also been used for the elimination of heavy metal ions these are believed to be relatively less toxic and eco friendly as compared to above mentioned metal oxide nps mgo nps are important members of this group which have been studied by various researchers and observed to be competent for the elimination of heavy metal ions for example cao et al 38 developed flowerlike mgo nps with high surface area and exhibited excellent removal efficiency towards pb ii and cd ii with maximum capacities of 1980 mg g and 1500 mg g respectively a different mechanism of adsorption based on cation exchange between mg ii ions from mgo nps and pb ii or cd ii was proposed which lead to the high adsorption capacities in another study mgo nps were used for the decontamination of waste water along with simultaneous bacterial disinfection the prepared mgo nps showed good removal efficiency for cd ii and pb ii ions along with escherichia coli e coli inactivatio 106 2 1 1 alumina based nanoadsorbent synthesis and functionalization another imperative metal oxide alumina al2o3 occurs in natural soils and has numerous structural phases namely α β ɤ ɵ and χ 39 40 in conventional methods α al2o3 is being utilized as a natural adsorbent possessing greater stability 41 42 alumina with strong interatomic bonding is a popular sorbent because it possesses intriguing properties i e its thermal conductivity compressive strength wear and corrosion resistance and electrical insulation are quite high 43 recent studies have illustrated the ability of al2o3 nps to boost the adsorption performance of certain nanomembranes in this context ghaemi 44 employed al2o3 nps to enhance the removal efficiency of polyethersulfone pes membranes toward copper here pes nano membrane was impregnated with different doses of al2o3 nps it was noticed that the uptake of metal ions increases by increasing the nps content in membrane matrix hojamberdiev et al 43 impregnated dithizone dtz and 2 amine 1 methyl benzimidazole mab in the pores of spent al2o3 catalyst the adsorption efficiencies of dtz al2o3 and mab al2o3 were determined by the sorption of ni ii cd ii and zn ii from water the highest adsorption capacities for ni ii 0 37 mmol g 1 zn ii 0 54 mmol g 1 and cd ii 1 01 mmol g 1 were noted for mab al2o3 the sorption of these heavy metal ions on mab al2o3 was due to physisorption and chemical reaction between metal ions and the mab al2o3 surfactant functionalization of metal oxides results into enhanced adsorption performance since most of metal oxide nanoparticles have a tendency to agglomerate which results into decrease in surface area therefore modification of the surface of metal oxide with surfactant has emerged as a successful method for improving the adsorption capacity of nanoadsorbent in this context adsorption performance of sodium dodecyl sulphate sds modified alumina i e al2o3 sds towards nh4 i ions was investigated by pham et al 45 authors observed that surface modification of alumina with sds induces a significant increase in removal efficiency due to change in surface charge resulted by coating of anionic surfactant in another report nguyen et al 46 illustrated the use of both sodium tetra decyl sulphate sts and sds modified ɤ alumina nanoparticles for the efficient removal of cd ii the authors investigated the effect of surfactants on the adsorption of cd ii ion and the removal efficiency was found to be significantly enhanced from 67 to 94 6 2 1 2 silica based nanoadsorbent synthesis and functionalization silica based nanomaterials another category of metal oxide nanoadsorbents possess great potential in metal ion adsorption due to their unique characteristics like large surface area controllable surface properties and well defined pore size in addition to this nanosilica presents a non toxic and eco friendly adsorbent further the surface modification of nanosilica with amino and thiol functional groups result into increased adsorption capacity and selectivity li et al 47 modified silica gel with nitrilotriacetic acid nta silica gel for the efficient removal of cu ii cd ii and pb ii from waste water the synthesized material showed quick removal of metal ion within 2 to 20 min with adsorption capacities of 63 5 53 14 and 76 22 mg g 1 for cu ii cd ii and pb ii respectively in another report amino functionalized 3 aminopropyl and phenyl groups silica nanospheres were investigated for the enhanced removal of cu ii ions 48 the adsorption capacity was found to increase with increase in concentration of amino groups najafi et al 49 also gave insight to the comparative removal of cd ii ni ii and pb ii using three different amino functionalized silica nano hollow spheres nh2 snhs and non functionalized silica based nanomaterials i e nanosilica spheres and non functionalized snhs and amino functionalized nanosilica gel nh2 sg the adsorption capacity of functionalized nanosilica was found to be higher as compared to snhs and maximum adsorption capacities for cd ii ni ii and pb ii employing nh2 snhs were 40 73 31 39 and 96 79 mg g 1 respectively 2 2 magnetic nanoparticles mnps based nanoadsorbent synthesis and functionalization magnetic nanomaterials constitute a major category of advanced nanomaterials which combine advantages of magnetic separation and nanotechnology for the better heavy metal ion removal magnetic separation technique is being widely used in the case of ecological issues because the mnps exhibit brilliant reusability after magnetic separation the characteristics of these magnetic nanomaterials alter considerably with reduction in size the multi domain structure of magnetic material changes to single domain ensuing new magnetic properties non mnps have less surface area and are difficult to separate from the aqueous phase that limits their applicability in wastewater decontamination alternatively mnps have a comparatively greater surface area biocompatibility chemical inertness less toxicity and easy dispersion ability hence the application of mnps in the waste water treatment is more reliable efficient and cost effective various mnps have been used by the researchers for the effective removal of heavy metal ions nano sized iron oxide particles are an important member of this family these offer increased adsorption capacity rapid adsorption rate easy separation and renewal in this regard iconaru et al 50 synthesized magnetite nps nfe3o4 and compared their removal efficiency with commercial magnetite towards as ii and cu ii the results indicated the higher adsorption capacity of synthesized magnetite as compared to commercial magnetite in another study fe3o4 mnps prepared by giraldo et al 51 were examined for the adsorptive removal of pb ii cu ii zn ii and mn ii ions the adsorption capacity of fe3o4 nps towards pb ii was found to be maximum and for mn ii it was minimum this can be attributed to different hydrated ionic radii of these heavy metal ions which lead to variation in electrostatic interactions between heavy metal cations and negatively charged adsorption sites in another contribution fe3o4 nanoadsorbents were studied for the adsorptive removal of pb ii ions from waste water with adsorption capacity of 36 0 mg g 52 amongst the various nanostructures nanotubes nanowires and nanorods have greater specific area and exhibit high capacity to eliminate heavy metal ions from water in a study by karami 53 magnetite nanorods were used for the effective removal of fe ii pb ii zn ii ni ii cd ii and cu ii ions from waste water the maximum adsorption capacities were found to be 127 113 107 95 88 and 76 mg g 1 for fe ii pb ii zn ii ni ii cd ii and cu ii respectively generally bare mnps are prone to oxidation and are easily agglomerated in aqueous medium which restricts their practical application beside the significant developments in synthesis of mnps maintenance of their stability by preventing them from agglomeration and precipitation is an important issue to overcome these limitations bare mnps can be functionalized by different moieties surface modification of mnps increases adsorption capacities and stability towards oxidation with enhanced selectivity towards a particular metal ion functionalization provides complex formation chemical binding and ligand combination in addition to electrostatic and van der waals interactions liable for the metal ion adsorption on the surface of adsorbent 54 55 functionalization using charged functional groups alters the charge on nanoadsorbent surface which results into enhanced electrostatic interactions between metal ions and the surface of adsorbent these improved electrostatic interactions are responsible for adsorption selectivity further surface functionalization of mnps with hydrophilic coating using polyethylene glycol peg poly vinyl alcohol pva and poly vinyl pyrollidine pvp as capping agents prevent them from agglomeration it leads to larger surface area to volume ratio and increases the homogeneity of mnps into the solution manipulation of properties of mnps by tailoring their surfaces results into selective adsorption of heavy metal ions type of surface functionalization and the geometric array of coating molecules decide the overall size and surface area of mnps which play an important role in enhanced and selective adsorption of heavy metal ions from waste water many investigations have been carried out for the functionalization of mnps with various materials like polymers organic inorganic biomolecules carbonaceous materials etc 2 2 1 polymer functionalized mnps polymers have also been used for the surface modification of mnps to obtain higher adsorption capacities polymeric support provides a number of advantages for nps functionalization such as better chemical stability high mechanical strength and bio compatibility many scientists have illustrated the use of polymers in combination with mnps fig 4 which improves the mechanical and thermal properties of polymer for example magnetic nanocomposite particles mncps fabricated with iminodiacetic acid grafted poly glycidylmethacrylate maleic anhydride pgma man copolymer were reported by hasanzadeh et al 8 the authors illustrated the efficiency of these mncps for the decontamination of water containing pb ii and cd ii ions similarly martínez cabanas et al 25 presented another polymer functionalized iron oxide mnps where chitosan was used as a polymer for the effective adsorption of as v a green approach has been used for the synthesis of above mentioned nanomaterial where iron oxide nps have been prepared using plant extract of eucalyptus the investigations revealed that iron oxide nanoparticle beads are an efficient as v adsorbent with small equilibrium times and excellent adsorption capacity at natural ph in another study mnps modified with hydroxyapatite mnhap were tested for the adsorptive removal of cd ii and zn ii 56 another polymeric mercaptoethylamino coated mnps mamnps were presented by madrakian et al 57 the experimental results demonstrated that mamnps showed high tendency towards the removal ag i hg ii pb ii and cd ii huang and chen 58 demonstrated the use of a new magnetic nanoadsorbent fabricated by the functionalization of fe3o4 nps with polyacrylic acid paa and diethylenetriamine deta for the adsorption of cu ii and cr vi the higher adsorption capacity was calculated for cu ii ions as compared to cr vi ions 2 2 2 biomolecules functionalized mnps functionalization of mnps with biomolecules enables their safe and eco friendly use in metal ion remediation process in addition to increased adsorption capacity many researchers investigated the use of biomolecule functionalized mnps in heavy metal ion adsorption in a contribution by verma et al 22 23 glycine modified magnetic fe3o4 nps gf mnps enclosed in alginate polymer in the form of beads were used where the adsorbent demonstrated excellent removal efficiency for pb ii ions owing to the amino and carboxylate groups on the surface of beads another adsorbent containing iron oxide mnps and ca alginate embedded on the surface of a biomass strain i e phanerochaete chrysosporium pellets was prepared by xu et al 59 for effective removal of pb ii with adsorption capacity 167 36 mg g in some reports substituted cellulose a biopolymer has also been used for functionalization of mnps fan et al 60 synthesized carboxy methyl cellulose immobilized fe3o4 mnps cmc fe3o4 which exhibit high adsorption capacity 152 0 mg g 1 of pb ii ions the results indicated that chelation as well as electrostatic attraction was responsible for the removal of pb ii by cmc fe3o4 this can be attributed to fact that cmc chains on the surface of mnps possess various functional groups which were responsible for the complexation with pb ii ions further the adsorption mechanism was based on electrostatic interactions between the ions and mnps surface which is positively charged when ph is below zero point charge zpc leading to reduced adsorption capacity and at ph higher than zpc increased adsorption capacity was observed in another study mnps modified with triazinyl β cyclodextrin t β cd mnps prepared by abdolmaleki et al 61 displayed superb adsorption performance towards pb ii cu ii zn ii and co ii the enhanced adsorption capability was attributable to the presence of many hydroxyl and azinyl nitrogen groups in triazinyl β cyclodextrin on the surface of mnps maximum adsorption capacities were obtained in the order pb ii cu ii zn ii co ii the considerable difference in the adsorption efficiencies may be due to the different complexation ability of the oxygen and nitrogen groups on the surface of mnp with the metal ions the extent of metal ligand binding depends mainly on the metal ion and its inclination to form ionic or covalent bonds 2 2 3 organic molecules functionalized mnps organic molecules provide various functional groups for the complexation with heavy metal ions which greatly enhance the adsorption capacity of mnps ge et al 62 fabricated acrylic acid aa and crotonic acid ca grafted fe3o4 mnps modified with 3 aminopropyltriethoxysilane aptes for the removal of heavy metal ions in the given order pb ii cu ii zn ii cd ii the difference is ascribed to the different complex capacity of the carbonyl with the metal ions amino functionalized magnetic nanoadsorbents mnps nh2 were also found to be effective in heavy metal ion elimination tan et al 63 demonstrated that amino functionalized fe3o4 nps displayed effective adsorptive removal toward pb ii ions similarly gao et al 64 functionalized mesoporous superparamagnetic fe3o4 nps with a chelating ligand i e triethylenetetramine these functionalised mnps have been illustrated for the removal of copper in waste water with 85 removal efficiency similarly shen et al 65 explored the mechanism of adsorption of cr vi on the surface of nanosized magnetic polymer functionalized with tetraethylene pentamine i e tepa nmps experimental data confirmed the adsorption of cr vi on these nmps due to the electrostatic interaction and also because of the reduction of cr vi into cr iii through charge transfer on the adsorbent surface in another category shen et al 66 synthesized a number of core shell fe3o4 nps functionalized with various multi amino groups i e nh2 nmps for the adsorption of cu ii and cr vi ions in sole metal ion system and co existing metal ion system the adsorption process was found to be highly dependent on ph of the medium for both cu ii and cr vi ions it was due the fact that adsorption process was mainly based on electrostatic interactions adsorption capacities were maximum at ph values between 2 4 at ph lower than 2 protonation of nh2 to nh3 results into lesser availability of nh2 binding sites which reduces adsorption efficiency at ph higher than 2 greater availability of nh2 binding sites results into increase in adsorption of cu ii ions on the other hand at ph above 4 precipitation of cu ii occurs similarly adsorption of cr iv i e hcro4 was maximum at ph 2 4 due to electrostatic attractions between hcro4 and nh3 higher ph declines adsorption capacity because of competition between hcro4 and oh ions further it was observed that adsorption process was competitive at higher concentration of metal ions and low ph values in coexisting system lower concentrations and higher ph values did not affect the adsorption efficiencies of coexisting systems liu et al 67 synthesized cost effective and environment friendly humic acid ha coated fe3o4 nps for the sorption of hg ii pb ii cd ii and cu ii the results depicted the improved stability and adsorption capacity of fe3o4 ha as compared to fe3o4 nps 2 2 4 carbonaceous material functionalized mnps furthermore functionalization of mnps with carbonaceous materials like graphene oxide go and activated carbon is also an effective method to improve the adsorption efficiency of nanoadsorbents for example magnetite graphene oxide lauric acid la nanocomposite containing ethylenediamine tetra acetic acid edta nps go fe3o4 la edta prepared by danesha et al 26 was used for the sorption of pb ii ions strong coordination ability of edta and the presence of cooh and oh on go surface resulted in their enhanced electrostatic interactions with metal ions which improved adsorption performance in another study magnetite nps modified with powder activated carbon i e fe3o4 c were used as an adsorbent for pb ii 68 another highly effective fe3o4 nps functionalized with edta were fabricated by ghasemi et al 69 for the adsorption of ag i hg ii mn ii zn ii pb ii and cd ii ions with adsorption efficiencies and adsorption capacities in the range of 96 104 and 71 169 mg g respectively 2 2 5 inorganic molecules functionalized mnps inorganic compounds like silica and edta have also been employed for the functionalization of mnps in the metal removal application with regard to this different wt of fe3o4 nps was modified with silica metformine and amine by ghaemi et al 70 the results depicted the highest cu ii removal about 92 for 0 1 wt metformine modified silica coated fe3o4 mnps due to high affinity in cu ii adsorption an effective nanoadsorbent mnps modified with silica and glutathione fe3o4 sio2 gsh mnps was successfully synthesized by xu et al 71 and subsequently applied for pb ii removal the prepared nanosorbents were consistent in size and offered abundant adsorption sites for pb ii also their super paramagnetic character helped their easy removal with the external magnet the maximum pb ii adsorption capacities were found to increase with the increase in temperature similarly mokadem et al 72 investigated the use of mnps modified with 1 2 3 triazole mnp trz and silica coated mnps trz in the elimination of metal ions with adsorption capacities in the order pb ii cu ii zn ii the observed sequence is the consequence of electronic properties of atoms of the ligand and metal ion characteristics which control the process of complexation higher the metal ionic potential greater will be its inclination to attract electrons of the ligand and thus the complex formed will be maximum stable 73 for cations with the same charge the stability of complexes tends to decrease with increase in ionic radii the hydrated ions sizes of the metal increased follows the sequence pb ii 4 01 a cu ii 4 19 a zn ii 4 30 a 74 in another scientific investigation girginova et al 5 used mnps coated with silica which were modified with dithiocarbamate groups silica coated mnps were observed to be highly efficient in the elimination of hg ii even at very low concentrations carbonate based adsorbents constitute another category of promising materials to functionalize mnps caco3 is an economical non toxic porous material with a large solubility product which remarkably improves the metal ion adsorption capacity of the adsorbents by facilitating precipitation reactions between caco3 and heavy metal ions however a few disadvantages such as low efficiency sludge generation and difficult separation restrict their use in waste water purification to overcome these technical problems caco3 can be combined with mnps for better separation from waste water and high adsorption capacity islam et al 24 synthesized mesoporous needle like magnetic adsorbent iron oxide caco3 io caco3 using hydrothermal method this adsorbent was used for the removal of as v cr vi and pb ii at a greater rate than any conventional adsorbents previously reported 2 2 6 nanocomposite mnps researchers have also explored magnetic nanocomposites of different metal oxides as nanosorbents in this respect flower shaped fe3o4 mno2 nanocomposite was synthesized by kim et al 75 the adsorbent displayed a significantly enhanced adsorption capacity for cd ii cu ii pb ii and zn ii than fe3o4 nps another important category of magnetic nanomaterials is metal ferrite nps where any metal is coupled with ferrite molecules to acquire the property of magnetic separation metal ferrite in general is represented as m fexoy where m denotes any metal which makes divalent bonds in a series of investigations mn zn ferrite mn0 67zn0 33fe2o4 76 copper ferrite cufe2o4 and znfe2o4 77 78 nps were synthesized for heavy metal ion elimination mn zn ferrites were employed for removing as v cd ii and pb ii with high removal efficiencies subsequently copper ferrite and zinc ferrite nps were used for the recovery of mo ii and pb ii from water respectively babadi et al 79 synthesized nanocomposite of nife2o4 salensi where nife2o4 nps were functionalized with a schiff base derived from salicylaldehyde and amino propyl triethoxy silane the synthesized nanocomposite was used for the adsorptive removal of ni ii from aqueous solution with 95 adsorption efficiency 2 3 polymer based nanoadsorbent synthesis and functionalization polymer based nanofibrous membranes have also been employed as the core substance of the adsorbents due to their well defined porous nature greater gas permeability minute interfiber pore size and large specific surface area which leads to their enhanced adsorption efficiency these possess high skeletal strength adjustable surface functional moieties and easily degradable properties which makes them a perfect choice for potential adsorbents membrane adsorption process on the surface of polymeric nanofibers involve adsorption of metal ions on functional groups of incorporated sorbent in the nanomembrane and permeation of waste water through membrane the presence of special functional groups like nh2 cooh so3h etc further enhance the adsorption capacity and selectivity of polymer based nanomembrane polymer based nanoadsorbents can be further categorised on the basis of material used 2 3 1 chitosan nps chitosan is a hydrophilic non toxic eco friendly and biocompatible polymer which can form complexes with various metal ions the presence of amino groups facilitates the interaction with metal ions through chelation and chemical modifications of chitosan further enhance its selectivity and sorption capacity further its sorption efficiency can be improved by linkage with various substances which lead to stabilization of chitosan in acidic medium and augment its mechanical properties for example dubey et al 7 synthesized chitosan alginate nps canps for adsorption of hg ii ions from water due to positive and negative ions of chitosan and alginate respectively they interact electrostatically with both the tripolyphosphate ions and calcium ions a remarkably high value of maximum adsorption capacity i e 217 39 mg g at 30 c of canps for hg ii ions was obtained in this study esmaeili and khoshnevisan 80 investigated the effectiveness of alginate functionalized chitosan nps alg cs nps for elimination of ni maximum removal of ni was observed to be 94 8 in this case in another study chitosan tio2 nanocomposites were synthesized by razzaz et al 2016 9 for the absorptive removal of cu ii and pb ii ions saad et al 81 fabricated core shell zno chitosan nps for the elimination of heavy metal ions in the order pb ii cd ii cu ii yuan et al 82 synthesized a series of 3d hierarchically porous nitrogen doped carbon materials hnc by using chitosan as a source of carbon nitrogen source the results indicated that hnc exhibits strong adsorption capacity for pb ii and cd ii in aqueous solution the authors also proposed that adsorption of pb ii on hnc is a chemisorption process caused by coordination and electrostatic interaction between the pb ii ions and n and o containing functional groups of hnc materials a similar kind of material i e chitin has also been employed for the adsorptive removal of heavy metal ions liu et al 83 synthesized chitin nanofibrils cnf by downsizing chitin micro particles cmp with no alteration in its chemical and structural properties the synthesized cnf were used for the elimination of heavy metal ions in order of cd ii ni ii cu ii zn ii pb ii cr iii the adsorption capacity values were observed to be greater than cmp because of larger specific surface area and extensive porosity of cnf 2 3 2 dendrimer nanoadsorbent organic polymeric sorbents containing chelating functional groups are another potential nanomaterial for the elimination of metal cations these consist of chelating functional groups and the polymer matrix or support in this context hasanzadeh et al 84 fabricated poly styrene alt maleic anhydride with 3 aminobenzoic acid further this chelating resin was modified by 1 2 diaminoethane or 1 3 diaminopropane for the adsorptive removal of heavy metal ions with percent removal in the order of fe ii cu ii zn ii pb ii in a similar study nanofibrous poly ethylene co vinyl alcohol evoh were synthesized 85 for cr vi adsorption from water the equilibrium time for adsorption was less than 100 min and the adsorption capacity was 90 74 mg g in another scientific report polyacrylonitrile pan nanofibers modified with amidoxime groups were applied for the adsorption of cu ii and pb ii ions 86 pan mof 808 nanofibers membranes were prepared by co electro spinning of polyacrylonitrile pan polymer and metal organic frameworks i e mof 808 and then investigated for scavenging pb ii cd ii zn ii and hg ii ions from an aqueous solution 108 the order of removal efficiency among these ions is zn 54 cd 50 pb 46 hg 34 taking into account the ionic radius of heavy metal ions the order is zn ii 0 74 å cd ii 0 95 å hg ii 1 02 å pb ii 1 19 å 87 the removal efficiency decreases as the ionic radius increases except for the interchanging positions of pb ii and hg ii this implies that steric effect of the ions prevents the approach of heavy metal ions to the adsorption site in another contribution cegłowski et al 88 synthesized two novel economical polymeric nanoadsorbents by the reaction of diethylenetriamine deta or pentaethylenehexamine peha with 1 3 5 tris 6 isocyanatohexyl 1 3 5 triazinane 2 4 6 trione hdi ic the obtained hdi ic deta and hdi ic peha polymers have varying ethyleneamine chain lengths because of which they can form polyamine chelating complexes with heavy metal ions the hdi ic peha exhibited approximately two times greater maximum adsorption capacities for cd ii co ii cr iii and cu ii ions as compared to hdi ic deta due to the presence of longer ethyleneamine chains martín et al 89 selected polyacrylonitrile pan as base polymer to prepare three ion selective nanofibers from ethylenediamine eda ethyleneglycol eg or diethylenetriamine dta the adsorption capacity values for cu ii pb ii and zn ii obtained in this study are 6 1 8 8 and 7 2 mmol g 1 respectively which are exceptionally higher are as compared to other materials this may be due to the large surface area of the nanofibers and their high degree of surface functionalization resulting in a greater number of chelating groups accessible for metal adsorption another study by shah et al 90 reports an efficient removal of cd ii ni ii cu ii and co ii with a low cost superadsorbent polymer hydrogel sph prepared from acrylic acid and acrylamide in various ratios all the compositions showed significant ability to adsorb the above mentioned heavy metal ions from aqueous medium the scientific investigation indicated greater selectivity of sph for co ii and cu ii relative to cd ii and ni ii which may be attributed to the fact that the metals smaller in size can easily penetrate in the polymer matrix and subsequently adsorb on the vacant site functionalized in the polymer chain 2 3 3 cellulose based nanoadsorbent adsorbent based on biopolymers such as cellulose have also been investigated for the elimination of heavy metal ions mautner et al 91 modified cellulose nanofibrils cnf with phosphate groups by reacting cnf with phosphoric acid p to synthesize cnf p it was found that these cnf p nanopapers adsorbed cu ii ions efficiently from aqueous solutions another highly promising bio absorbent in three different forms i e tetramethyl piperidine oxide tempo oxidized 2 3 6 tricarboxy cellulose nanofiber t cnfs and tpc cnfs with and without polyamide amine epichlorohydrin crosslinker pae was synthesized by abou zeid et al 111 for scavenging heavy metal ions such as cu ii pb ii and ca ii from waste water it was observed that cu ii and pb ii ions were the highest adsorbed ions 92 23 97 34 and 82 19 mg g for t cnfs tpc cnfs and crosslinked tpc cnfs respectively 2 4 zeolite nps in past years zeolites are being comprehensively utilized for the separation and remediation processes due to their high porosity alkali and alkaline earth metals can be moved in their framework to balance negative charge between si iv and al iii but in current times zeolites are being used in np form which is more efficient for adsorption because they have large specific surface area and surface activity in one report polysulfone psf membrane imbued with zeolite nps was used where adsorption and the filtration processes were coupled for the dynamic removal of pb ii and ni ii ions 93 the maximum adsorption capacity of the impregnated membrane for pb ii and ni ii was calculated to be 682 and 122 mg g respectively another scientific study by deravanesiyan et al 94 illustrated the adsorption of cr iii and co ii ions using alumina nps immobilized zeolite aniz the removal capacity of this new sorbent was compared with al2o3 nps and nax zeolite granules results revealed that the adsorption efficiency of zeolite has been considerably enhanced cr iii 31 76 co ii 17 2 on immobilizing al2o3 nps in another work polyvinyl alcohol pva nax nanozeolite adsorbent was fabricated and used for removal of ni ii and cd ii ions from aqueous medium the adsorption results indicated a higher affinity of pva zeolite nanofibrous adsorbent for cd ii ions than ni ii ions the adsorption capacities for cd ii were observed to be much higher than ni ii 95 2 5 carbon based nanomaterials new generation nanoadsorbents owing to the distinctive physical and chemical properties carbonaceous based functional materials have emerged as one of the most favourable nanoadsorbents they are attaining great attentsion of present researchers because of immense scope in treatment of waste water decontamination several endeavours to obtain a variety of carbon based nanostructures like carbon nanotubes cnts carbon based nanocomposites and graphene had been performed in the past for the removal of various kinds of pollutants among these cnts are more promising due to their large surface area small size cylindrical hollow structure and electrical conductivity basically cnts are of two main categories viz single walled swcnts and multi walled mwcnts various studies describe the use of cnts in heavy metal ion removal from waste water for example rahbari and goharrizi 96 described the adsorption of pb ii from water on cnts with adsorption capacity of 70 1 mg g similarly stafiej and pyrzynska 97 demonstrated the use of cnts for the adsorptive removal of ions with removal capacities in the order of cu ii pb ii co ii zn ii mn ii in another investigation oxidized multi walled carbon nanotube with coating of mno2 mno2 omwcnts were used for the efficient removal of cd ii ions from aqueous solution with adsorption capacity of 41 6 mg g 83 recently carbon layered silicate nanocomposites have triggered considerable research interest because of their improved properties as compared to their counterparts i e conventional carbonaceous materials in an investigation by zhu et al 98 an environmentally benign montmorillonite carbon mmt c adsorbent was fabricated for removal of pb ii with maximum adsorption capacity of 247 85 mg g graphene another member of carbon based nanomaterials has gained a significant attention in the field of environmental remediation the presence of oxygen containing functional moieties on graphene oxide go surface provides a strong hydrophilic nature to it which lead to its fine dispersion in water the distinctive functional groups and high surface area of go makes it a prospective candidate for the waste water decontamination these nanomaterials are effective against various pollutants present in waste water removal of heavy metal ions is based on the adsorption via complexation of metal ions with the oxide binding site in graphene the organic pollutants like dyes interact with delocalized π electron system of graphene fig 5 zhao et al 11 synthesized go nanosheets for the adsorptive removal of cd ii and co ii adsorption capacities of 106 3 and 68 2 mg g towards cd ii and co ii respectively were obtained in another scientific study 3d mno2 nanotubes reduced graphene oxide hydrogel mngh was prepared by zeng et al 99 these uniformly sized 20 nm mno2 nanotubes were wrapped by interconnected porous reduced graphene oxide rgo sheets the 3d porous nanostructure and the synergetic action between rgo and mnts of the hydrogel induced greater adsorption capacity for pb ii 356 37 mg g 1 cd ii 177 4 mg g 1 ag ii 138 2 mg g 1 cu ii 121 5 mg g 1 and zn ii 83 9 mg g 1 further the experimental conditions for the removal of metal ions using above mentioned nanoadsorbents have been summarized in table 2 3 separation of nanoadsorbent from reaction system reusablity of adsorbents is a significant factor for evaluating their viability in practical applications because an efficient repetitive availability of adsorbents will reduce the overall cost of the adsorption process there is variety of reports by the researchers demonstrating the different methods for the separation of adsorbent from the reaction system followed by reusability of the nanoadsorbent zeng et al 99 employed 0 5 m hno3 solution to recover pb ii from the mngh nanoadsorbent the adsorption capacities of pb ii decline to some extent with chronological cycles of reuse about 87 of its original adsorption capacity was retained even after eight reusability cycles therefore mngh exhibited immense ease for reusability in removing heavy metal ions in another scientific investigation polystyrene poly n isopropylmethacrylamide acrylic acid i e pst p nipmam aac core shell gel particles used for the removal of pb ii cu ii cd ii and cr iii ions were eluted with 0 5 m hcl solution in this case pb ii ions adsorption on these gel particles was maintained up to three repeated adsorption and desorption cycles but small decline in removal of cu ii cd ii and cr iii ions was noted in third cycle of reusability 101 the regenerative capacity of hnc 3 was evaluated by using diluted hno3 solution as desorbent the removal efficiency for pb ii ions is still maintained after the fifth cycle demonstrating the good reusability of hnc 3 these observations imply that the active sites on hnc 3 occupied by pb ii ions could be completely recovered by treating them with an acid this might be due to the competition for adsorption sites between h and pb ii 82 fan et al 60 examined the reusability of cmc fe3o4 for adsorption of pb ii ions by washing the nanoadsorbent with 0 1 m na2 hpo4 and water it was observed that there was a slight decrease in adsorption capacity with increasing adsorption and desorption cycles the adsorption capacity of cmc fe3o4 was found to be greater than 85 after five cycles the saturation magnetization of cmc fe3o4 after five cycles was found to be 45 0 emu g 1 which is approximately same as these nps before the adsorption experiment 45 5 emu g 1 these results predict that the cmc fe3o4 have tremendous reusability and stability making them valuable mnps for wastewater remediation in another study martín et al 89 examined the recovery of cu ii pb ii and zn ii ions from ion selective polyacrylonitrile nanofibers and assessed their reusability over four adsorption desorption cycles the excellent results were given by 1 0 m hno3 and 0 5 m h3po4 with more than 90 recovery for ions a steady behavior was noted for pb ii and zn s ii with no significant decline in the adsorption capacity suggesting that these nanofibers can be reused and recycled easily on the other hand the adsorption capacity decreased for cu ii ions with the adsorption desorption cycles 4 factors affecting adsorption scientific investigations have examined the effect of several factors viz ph adsorbent dose contact time temperature and initial ion concentration on heavy metal ion adsorption on the surface of nps herein we have reflected on the influence of the above mentioned factors on the adsorptive removal of heavy metal ions 4 1 effect of ph ph plays a key role in the whole adsorption process and particularly for the adsorption capacities therefore it is necessary to investigate its effect on the removal of metal ions in a scientific report it has been illustrated that on increasing the ph from 2 0 to 5 0 the adsorptive removal of hg ii ions by canps increases at low ph the electrostatic repulsions between the protonated functional moieties on the surface of canps and metal cations hinder their adsorption in addition to this the presence of a significant number of h and h3o ions in water compete with the metal ions for adsorption however at some moderate ph the rate of adsorption enhances because of reduction in electrostatic repulsions due to deprotonation of the active sites 7 various other investigations have also demonstrated that adsorption of heavy metal ions is favoured at moderate ph rather than at lower values for example adsorption of pb ii and cu ii on the surface of chitosan tio2 nanofibres reached the maximum values at ph 6 0 and were lowest from ph 2 0 to 4 0 9 in a similar study it was demonstrated that with increase in ph from 4 0 to 6 0 the percentage of adsorption of cd ii appreciably increased and then became constant 97 at ph 9 0 after that percentage of adsorption decreased to 80 on further increasing the ph to 11 0 75 the results of these investigations have been compiled in fig 6 a from the above discussion we can conclude that moderate ph is favourable for the removal of heavy metal ions because at this ph the sorbent surface gets deprotonated which leads to augmentation of the negatively charged sites this results into enhanced electrostatic attractions between the surface of adsorbent and metal cations which causes an increase in the adsorption capacity but at lower ph there is an increase in adsorption sites carrying positive charge which leads to increase in the repulsive forces among the adsorbent surface and the positively charged metal ions decreases the adsorption of metal ions 58 at higher ph hydroxylated complexes of the metal ions are formed which destroy the nanoadsorbent s surface leading to blockage of some active sites 4 2 effect of adsorbent dose it plays a major role in the adsorption process adsorption capacity for the removal of heavy metal ions depends upon the number of effective adsorption sites which increases with increase in adsorbent dose therefore the adsorption capacity enhances with the amount of adsorbent dose of nps but further increase in adsorbent dose results into agglomeration of nps decreased surface area and reduction in sorption sites thereby decreasing the adsorption capacity there are many investigations in literature demonstrating the influence of adsorbent dose on heavy metal ion adsorption for example the optimum concentration of nanofibrous chitosan coated with tio2 was 2000 mg l for the adsorption of pb ii and cu ii ions it was observed that at higher concentrations agglomeration of nps lead to partial deactivation of nanofiber surfaces as a consequence the adsorption capacity of adsorbent reduced significantly 9 a considerable in increase adsorption efficiency from 41 7 to 92 was observed on increasing fe3o4 c nanosorbent dosage from 0 5 to 2 g l however it lead to a reduction in adsorption capacity from 41 7 to 22 9 mg g the reason behind the improvement of removal efficiency is the ease of access of pb ii ions to the active sites on the fe3o4 c surface on the other hand reduced adsorption capacity with increase in adsorbent dose may result from the inter particle aggregation due to high adsorbent concentration which reduces the active surface area of fe3o4 c 68 these results have been presented graphically in fig 6b 4 3 effect of contact time the time of contact between the metal ion solution and nps plays a major role in economical wastewater treatment process it has been observed that with increase in contact time removal efficiency enhances which may be ascribed to the fact that interaction time between metal ions and active sites on nanoadsorbent increases further removal efficiency is fast during the initial stage and increases slowly thereafter this is primarily due to the accessibility of higher number of vacant sites on the adsorbent surface initially which subsequent decreases with time this kind of adsorption behaviour was illustrated in a study where the removal efficiency for hg ii on the canps surface enhanced on increasing the contact time from 0 to 90 min the increase in removal efficiency of hg ii was quick during the first 30 min then slowed down with the achievement of adsorption equilibrium in 90 min 7 in a similar study the adsorption of pb ii and cd ii on to mncps surface was observed to be 100 and 91 of the total adsorption 53 33 and 48 53 mg g within the initial 20 min of contact time respectively thereafter due to equilibrium between rate of adsorption and desorption the process became independent of contact time 8 some of these studies have been compared in fig 6c 4 4 effect of temperature solution temperature is also an essential parameter in adsorption process in general initial increase in the temperature reduces the solution viscosity which results in enhancement in the diffusion rate of the adsorbate molecules across the adsorbent surface and leads to elevated adsorption efficiency subsequent change in temperature can affect the adsorption process in two different ways depending upon whether the process involves absorption or evolution of heat the adsorption capacity decreases with increase in the temperature for an exothermic process whereas it increases in case of an endothermic one furthermore temperature study of an adsorption process provides significant information regarding various thermodynamic parameters i e the standard gibbs free energy δg enthalpy δh and entropy changes δs accompanying adsorption in a scientific investigation the adsorption of hg ii on canps was found to be exothermic the removal efficiency increased on raising the temperature from 10 c to 30 c and decreased thereafter with maximum adsorption approximately 79 40 at 30 c further decrease might be due to the increased mobility of metal ions with rise in temperature leading to desorption or de chelation of metal ions from adsorbent surface therefore the number of metal ions adsorbed on canps decreased on increasing the temperature moreover for exothermic adsorption process the electrostatic interactions between adsorbent and hg ii ions weaken at elevated temperature 7 the negative δg values and positive δh values predicted that sorption of metal ions on the surface of adsorbent was spontaneous and endothermic in another study adsorption of pb ii on fe3o4 nanoadsorbent surface at different temperatures was found to be endothermic there was an increase in pb ii adsorption efficiency on increasing the temperature which can be attributed to increase in ionic mobility which results into greater number of ions interacting with active sites 52 4 5 effect of initial ion concentration initially the rate of adsorption increases on increasing the concentration of metal ions up to a certain extent but further increase leads to a decrease in removal efficiency this might be due to the reason that for a fixed amount of adsorbent an optimum concentration of metal ion should be present in the solution at low concentration lesser number of metal ions will be available for the adsorption which leads to low removal capacity but if concentration is increased the number of ions available for the adsorption increases which results in higher adsorption rate but beyond a certain initial concentration there is the greater availability of ions for same number of adsorption sites which consequently reduces the removal efficiency for example on increasing the initial concentration of hg ii from 4 mg l to 12 mg l on the surface of canps enhances the adsorption rate which decreases subsequently 7 in a similar investigation the sorption capacity of pva zno nanofibrous adsorbent for u vi cu ii and ni ii ions increased with increasing initial concentrations of metal ions from 90 to 500 mg l 34 some of these results are presented in fig 6d 4 6 effect of ionic strength ionic strength of the aqueous solution plays an important role in adsorption process as it describes the effect of additional ions present in aqueous solution on the adsorption of adsorbate molecules on the surface of adsorbent generally it is studied by adding different concentrations of ions like na cl etc in adsorbate solution the extent of effect of strength of ions depends upon the screening of coulombic potential between adsorbent molecule and adsorbing ions and competition among the target ions and added ions for active sites on adsorbent surface the adsorption efficiency depends also gets affected by the concentration of added ions as well as adsorbent s affinity if adsorbent has higher affinity towards target metal ions as compared to added ions its adsorption efficiency is negligibly altered by the ionic strength of solution some reports in literature describe the negligible effect of ionic strength on the adsorption of heavy metal ions hasanzadeh et al 8 demonstrated the effect of nacl at 3 mol l concentrations on the adsorption of two heavy metal ions pb ii and cd ii on the surface of mncps it was observed that nacl has insignificant effect on the adsorption of heavy metal ions which proves that the adsorbent has higher affinity towards pb ii and cd ii than na ions in a study by xu et al 71 a slight increase in adsorption capacity of pb ii on fe3o4 sio2 gsh mnps was observed with addition of nacl at concentration of 0 025 mm but further increase in nacl concentration upto 0 2 mm lead to decrease in adsorption capacity from 98 87 to 85 72 mg g 1 this observation can be explained on the basis of the fact that initially nacl promotes the dissociation of functional groups on the surface of adsorbent enhancing the adsorption capacity later decrease was due to inter ionic competition for binding sites therefore it can be concluded that the effect of ionic strength can vary from negligible to considerable depending upon the nacl concentration as well as affinity of the adsorbent surface towards adsorbate molecules 5 strategies for evaluating metal ion adsorption by nps 5 1 adsorption kinetics kinetics describes the rate of adsorption process with respect to the effect of time and reactant concentration on the rate of reaction rate of adsorption process can be described by various kinetic models depending upon rate of solute uptake and reactant concentration most commonly used kinetic models to investigate the rate of adsorption process i e pseudo 1st order pseudo 2nd order intra particle diffusion model and double exponential model are discussed as follows linear form of integrated rate equation of pseudo 1st order and pseudo 2nd order model can be expressed as eqs 1 and 2 1 log q e q t l o g q e k 1 2 303 t 2 t q t 1 k 2 q e 2 1 q e t where qt is the adsorption capacity at time t qe is the adsorption capacity at equilibrium mg g k1and k2 are the rate constant of pseudo first order adsorption min 1 and pseudo 2nd order respectively t is the contact time min from the slope and intercept of the plot of log qe qt versus t pseudo 1st order k1 and qe can be determined respectively for pseudo 2nd order values of k2 and equilibrium adsorption capacity qe can be calculated from the intercept and slope of the linear plot of t qt versus t respectively intra particle diffusion model is based on weber and morris 105 theory which describes the multistep adsorption process involving transport of adsorbate molecules from the solution phase to the surface of the adsorbent molecules which is followed by transfer of molecules into the interior of the solid pores linear equation for this model is as eq 3 3 q t k i d t 0 5 c where qt is the adsorption capacity at time t t0 5 is the half life time in seconds kid mg g min0 5 is the rate constant of intraparticle diffusion and c is boundary thickness the values of kid and c are obtained from the slope and intercept of the linear plot of qt versus t0 5 recently to describe the adsorption of heavy metal ions two step mechanism is also considered the first step involves the rapid uptake of metal ions through external and internal diffusion further metal ion uptake slows down in the second step which finally reaches the equilibrium stage 104 the mechanism is diffusion controlled where kd1 min 1 and kd2 min 1 are diffusion parameters controlling overall kinetics this mechanism is also known as double exponential model which can be expressed as eq 4 4 q t q e d 2 m a d s e k d 2 t in eq 4 d1 and d2 are sorption rate parameters in mmol 1 for rapid and slow step respectively mads is mass of adsorbent g qt and qe are amount of metal ion adsorbed mg at time t min and equilibrium respectively eq 4 can be simplified by assuming the exponential term negligible which allows the determination of d2 and kd2 further knowing the values of d2 and kd2 the parameters d1 and kd1 can be obtained from the plot of linearised eq 5 5 ln q e q t d 2 m a d s e k d 2 t l n d 1 m a d s k d 1 t extensive reports are available in literature illustrating the applicability of different adsorption kinetic models on the metal ion adsorption on the surface of different nps some of them have been summarized below table 3 5 2 adsorption isotherms adsorption isotherms correlate the extent of adsorption of heavy metal ions with their concentrations at constant temperature to characterize adsorption mechanism langmuir freundlich temkin and dubinin radushkevich adsorption isotherms are used 107 langmuir model depicts the monolayer adsorption of the solute on adsorbent surface with fixed number of adsorption sites with equivalent affinity towards adsorbate molecules linear form of this model used to evaluate the data is given as eq 6 6 c e q e 1 q 0 b c 0 q 0 where qe amount of metal ion adsorbed mg g ce is equilibrium concentration mg l q0 is monolayer adsorption capacity mg g b is langmuir constant l mg related to the adsorption energy linear plot of ce qe versus ce give the values of with slope 1 q0 and intercept 1 q0b langmuir model does not give any idea about the heterogeneous adsorption and roughness of the adsorbent surface however freundlich model describes the multilayer adsorption and roughness of the adsorbent surface non uniform adsorption energies linear form of this model can be described by eq 7 7 l o g q e l o g k f 1 n l o g c e in eq 7 kf and n are freundlich constants related to heterogeneity and bonding energy respectively the value of n depicts the extent of deviation from linearity values of kf and n are determined from intercept and slope respectively from the plot of lnqe versus lnce temkin isotherm assumes the linear decrease in heat of adsorption for adsorbate molecules with increase in coverage owing to adsorbent adsorbate interactions moreover it describes the constant distribution of the bonding energies up to some maximum binding energy temkin isotherm is given by following equations 8 q e r t b l n a t r t b l n c e 9 b r t b t 10 q e b l n a t b l n c e where at is temkin isotherm equilibrium binding constant l g related to maximum binding energy bt is temkin isotherm constant r is universal gas constant 8 314 j mol k t is temperature at 298 k and b is constant related to heat of sorption j mol dubinin radushkevich drk isotherm model considers adsorption mechanism to involve gaussian energy distribution onto a heterogeneous surface this model is generally used to model the adsorption on carbon nanomaterials this theory gives better result than langmuir and freundlich isotherm for the adsorption of organic molecules on carbon nanotubes and carbon nanoparticles drk isotherm considers that surface curvature defects of adsorbent also play an important role in adsorption process as the flat surfaces allow more atoms to approach for adsorption and increase the rate of adsorption this model is fitted with high solute activities and the intermediate range of concentrations and can be represented as 11 q e q s e x p k a d 2 where qe is amount of adsorbate in the adsorbent at equilibrium mg g qs is theoretical isotherm saturation capacity mg g kad is dubinin radushkevich isotherm constant mol2 kj2 and ε is dubinin radushkevich isotherm constant which can be calculated as 12 ε r t l n 1 1 c e where r t and ce represent the gas constant 8 314 j mol k absolute temperature k and adsorbate equilibrium concentration mg l respectively this approach is usually applied to distinguish the physical and chemical adsorption of adsorbate with its mean free energy e e per molecule of adsorbate for removing a molecule from its location in the sorption space to the infinity can be computed by the relationship 13 e 1 2 b d r where bdr is denoted as the isotherm constant several studies based on adsorption of metal ions on the surface nps have been reported in literature some studies have been compiled in table 4 6 conclusion nanoscience and nanotechnology have witnessed great advancements in recent years which paved a way for the development of efficient economical and eco friendly approaches for environment remediation a variety of nanomaterials exhibit certain physicochemical properties that make them a promising candidate for wastewater purification the nanoparticles can remove heavy metal ions even at low concentration with additional benefit of high selectivity and adsorption capacity adsorption is extremely successful and simple physicochemical technique used for the extraction of heavy metals from wastewater in the present review we have studied various nanostructured materials such as metal metal oxide magnetic chitosan polymer based carbonaceous and zeolite used as adsorbents for elimination of heavy metal ions these materials are summarized in table 2 along with experimental conditions for metal ions removal furthermore the recent research is focused on the surface functionalization and modification of nps to improve their dispersion stability and separation from suspension medium various molecules like inorganic organic polymeric biomolecules etc are being used for the functionalization of nanoadsorbents the separation process can be made easy by providing magnetic character to the nanoadsorbents further the impact of variables such as ph of the solution adsorbent dosage temperature time initial concentration of metal ion and ionic strength of solution on adsorption process have also been summarized ph is identified as an important factor which highly affects the removal of cations from solution metal ions removal was observed to be maximum at moderate ph values rather than very low or high ph the adsorption capacity of the adsorbent depends upon the metal to binding sites ratio which explains the effect of adsorbent dose temperature also influences the adsorption process to a significant extent for an exothermic adsorption process the rate of adsorption decreases with rise in temperature whereas endothermic adsorption process leads to increased adsorption capacity at high temperature effect of contact time demonstrated that removal is rapid initially which slows down later at equilibrium similarly effect of initial ion concentration depicted that adsorption capacity of adsorbent increases initially with increasing metal ion concentration and decreases thereafter due to saturation of active sites of adsorbent 7 future perspectives the review concludes with the encapsulated projection of the fact that these nanomaterials have a great potential for use in heavy metal ions elimination from wastewater in future such article will provide multifaceted information regarding the researched subject matter to the future workers they will be able to obtain comparative and comprehensive information regarding the applicability of various types of nanoparticles in scavenging heavy metal ions from waste water as a result of which this article will provide not only the insight into various aspects explored by the earlier scientists but also help them design their own research problems taking into account the usability and implications of the research work in science as well as industries declaration of competing

14166,this study aimed to investigate the effects of cooperative membrane surface charge of thin film composite tfc membranes for removal of cu ii from aqueous solution using nanofiltration nf and forward osmosis fo process a total of five composite membranes with different piperazine polyethyleneimine pip pei ratio 1 0 pip 0 3 pei 0 5 pei 0 7 pei 1 0 pei were fabricated and the physicochemical properties of these membranes were characterized using scanning electron microscope sem attenuated total reflection fourier transform infra red atr ftir zeta potential and contact angle analysis physicochemical analysis confirmed the formation of polyamide pa layer for all tfc membranes result of zeta potential analysis revealed that 1 0 pei is positively charged surface whereas 1 0 pip is negatively charged consequently 1 0 pei exhibits higher flux compared to 1 0 pip owing to its higher hydrophilicity interestingly 1 0 pei demonstrates the highest copper cu ii ion rejection of more than 95 and 99 in nf and fo operation respectively outperforming the other produced tfcs result of the elemental diffraction x ray edx further explained that the copper rejection was facilitated by the cooperative surface charge keywords surface charge thin film composite forward osmosis 1 introduction heavy metal ions are generally known to be non degradable and bio accumulative in human bodies 1 2 copper cu a common heavy metal ion is widely used in industries particularly electroplating etching metal finishing pigment and alloy manufacturing 3 4 despite cu playing an important role in human biochemistry only minimal traces level of cu is needed in human body 5 whereas excessive exposure of cu could lead to liver damage wilson disease and insomnia 6 in addition the european union has included cu as the grey list back in 1976 as list of hazardous materials in which their content in the disposal to be reduced 7 precipitation activated carbon adsorption ion exchange membrane filtration and hybrid system are among known methods for disposal of metal ions from wastewater 8 13 however some of these methods possess several drawbacks including requirement of high energy and chemicals selective removal and generation of toxic secondary waste 14 despite these disadvantages membrane technology continued to gain significant attention among researchers due to its high efficacy and advantages for industrial implementation 15 17 in general membrane acts as a selective barrier which allows the passage of certain constituents whilst inhibits the passage of other constituents based on steric size exclusion mechanism the common membrane processes can be classified into microfiltration mf ultrafiltration uf nanofiltration nf reverse osmosis ro and forward osmosis fo in which the first two are often use microporous membrane while the latter three use thin composite membrane with selective dense layer due to the smaller sizes of the hydrated metal ions eg cd2 0 86 nm pb2 0 80 nm cu2 0 84 and zn2 0 86 nm separation mechanism by steric exclusion alone using microporous membrane is ineffective 18 throughout the years studies have progressed into introducing selective dense layer typically polyamide pa layer on top of the membrane support layer or its substrate to produce a thin film composite tfc 16 the presence of this dense layer facilitates the rejection of small size contaminants by size exclusion mechanism many studies have incorporated nanoparticles to further improve the physicochemical properties and rejection of metal ions either into pa layer or substrate layer during fabrication of the thin film nanocomposite tfn in which rejection of metal ions is enhanced through donnan exclusion or charge interaction 18 20 to date most of the studies on the effect of membrane surface charge have been focused on reverse osmosis ro 21 ultrafiltration uf 22 and nanofiltration nf membrane 23 however very few studies have been done on forward osmosis fo it is suggested that membrane surface charge plays role in the separation of metal ions due to the electrostatic interaction 18 24 thus this study aims to justify the effects of membrane surface charge in removing cu ii ions from synthetic wastewater using nf and fo processes to observe this the tfc membranes were fabricated by using different loading ratio of piperazine pip with polyethyleneimine pei to confirm that pa is successfully fabricated physicochemical properties of the membranes such as surface functional groups surface and cross sectional morphologies surface roughness and surface charge need to be evaluated to ensure successful pa fabrication the performances of fo and nf processes were compared after fo process was performed 2 experimental 2 1 materials the commercial uf polysulfone psf membrane model us020 manufactured by rising sun membrane technology co ltd with mwco of 20 000 da was used as the support layer for fabrication of pa layer by interfacial polymerization piperazine pip sigma aldrich polyethyleneimine pei acros organic trimesoyl chloride tmc sigma aldrich and n hexane merck were used for the feed and draw solution cuso4 and mgcl2 pellets purchased from sigma aldrich were used 2 2 thin film composite tfc preparation via interfacial polymerization prior to the pa layer preparation on psf substrate by interfacial polymerization psf substrates were immersed in di water overnight the wetted substrates were then attached onto a glass plate and the excess water was gently removed aqueous solution of 2 w v pei was poured onto the substrate for 2 25 min and then the excess pei was removed and air dried at 37 c for 10 min next the substrate was immersed in 0 1 w v of tmc in n hexane for 1 5 min subsequently the excess tmc was removed and oven dried at curing temperature of 60 c for 5 min finally the produced tfc was rinsed stored in di water for further usage and denoted as 1 0 pei similar procedure was repeated using different ratio composition of pei over pip as referred in table 1 with the exception of the 1 0 pip for preparation of pa layer using pip as the aqueous monomer the psf substrate was immersed in aqueous solution of 2 w v pip for 2 min when the excess pip solution was removed the membrane was rubber rolled until no water droplets were observed next the substrate was immersed in 0 1 w v of tmc in n hexane for 1 min and subsequently the excess tmc was removed and oven dried at curing temperature of 60 c for 5 min 2 3 tfc membranes characterization the surface of the active layer and the cross sectional morphologies of the thin film composite membranes with magnifications of 10k and 15k were examined using a scanning electron microscopy sem hitachi tm3000 japan for cross sectional observation all samples were fractured in liquid nitrogen and dried inside a desiccator the surface functional groups of all membrane samples were determined by using atr ftir spectrometer irtrace shimadzu each sample was scanned at wavelength 500 cm 1 to 4000 cm 1 with a total scanning of 600 times the surface roughness of membrane was evaluated by using atomic force microscopy afm dfm spa 300 hv in dynamic force mode in order to obtain the mean surface roughness ra each sample was observed under afm within the scan size of 2 μm x 2 μm the water contact angle for the determination of tfc membranes hydrophilicity was analysed by using sessile drop method a goniometer oca 15 pro dataphysics equipped with motor driven syringe was used to draw out 0 50 μl droplet of di water to be contacted with the surface of the dried membranes at room temperature at least 10 readings from different surface locations were taken and the average values were calculated and presented for accurate consistency in order to determine the nature of the membrane surface charge streaming potential measurement was carried out using an anton paar zeta potential analyser malvern uk model malvern zetasizer nano zsp water ph 7 was used as dispersant at 25 c in addition membrane autopsy was carried out after all of tfcs were tested to reject copper ion using nanofiltration system the reason for the autopsy was to determine percentage of copper traces wt that have been deposited on top of the surface of the tfc after post treatment with the nf the post mortem was carried out using energy dispersive x ray analyzer edx a built in function by the sem analyser hitachi tm3000 japan prior to the analysis the membrane sections were dissected about 1 cm2 and kept inside a desiccator 2 4 nanofiltration performance test prior of fo process the performance of fabricated membranes were firstly evaluated using a cross flow nanofiltration nf system from this experiment the best two 2 tfc membranes will be used for the fo test prior to the test aqueous cuso4 containing 200 ppm cu ii ion was prepared each membrane sample was mounted inside the membrane test cell with an effective area of 20 6 cm2 250 ml of cuso4 feed solution was poured into the feed tank pressure is maintained at 5 bars for the first 30 min for membrane compression and subsequently reduced to 4 bars and the permeate samples were collected three times at 15 min intervals a bench conductivity meter jenway 4520 was used to measure the ions concentration of before and after filtration whilst the cu ii ion concentration in the permeate was precisely measured using aas analyser model aa 7000 shimadzu the cu ii rejection was determined using the following equation 1 r 1 c p c f x 100 where cp is the copper concentration ppm in permeate and cf is the feed copper concentration ppm respectively 2 5 forward osmosis performance test the rejection test was performed with a bench scale cross flow fo system sterlitech cfo42p fo equipped with two 2 peristaltic pumps a membrane cell mounting with an effective area of 0 0042 m2 and an electronic balance placed under the draw solution tank fig 1 all tests were conducted at room temperature 25 c the speed of the pumps was maintained at 1800 rpm and the volume of the feed solution and the draw solution were fixed at 500 ml and 250 ml respectively the fo experiment was carried out to evaluate the performance of the two distinct charged membranes with highest rejection chosen from the earlier nf test aqueous cuso4 solution containing 1000 ppm cu ii ion was used as feed and 1 0 m of aqueous mgcl2 was used as the draw agent in terms of the membrane orientation all tests were conducted in active layer facing feed solution al fs configuration for fo process the mass change of the draw solution mgcl2 and concentration change of the feed solution cuso4 were recorded constantly at 20 minutes time intervals based on the data obtained the fo water flux fw l m2 h and reverse solute flux rsf g m2 h were calculated using formula 2 and 3 respectively meanwhile the cu ii rejection by fo was determined using the same eq 1 however the cp which is the concentration of permeated cu ii ion in draw solution sample was analysed by using aas 2 f w δ m δ t 1 a m 3 r s f c t v t c 0 v 0 a m δ t where in eq 2 δ m is the change in mass g of the draw solution whereas δ t is the difference of final second and the initial time and a m is the effective membrane area in m2 in the calculation of reverse solute flux eq 3 c 0 a n d v 0 are the initial concentration and initial volume of the draw solution respectively while c t a n d v t are the concentration and volume of the draw solution at predetermined t i m e 20 m i n u t e s 3 results and discussion 3 1 physicochemical properties of tfc 3 1 1 organic functional groups atr ftir the chemical functional groups on the top surface of the composite membranes were analysed via atr ftir analysis fig 2 shows the atr ftir spectra of the pristine psf membrane and composite membranes with different amine monomers which are pei pip and the ratio composition between the two aforementioned monomers from the figure it is confirmed that the polyamide pa layer has been successfully formed on top of the substrate when compared to the pristine psf membrane absence of pa layer spectra two new peaks appeared at 1652 cm 1 and 1559 cm 1 stipulating the characteristic of amide i co stretching and amide ii nh bands 25 26 though the appearance of bending at 1559 cm 1 is not strong due to the overlapping of other common functional groups it is however justifiable when the two spectra of 1 0 pei and pristine psf membrane were compared at that particular wavenumber there was a slight slanting slope over the 1 0 pei spectrum observed as compared to the steep one belonged to the pristine spectrum furthermore from 1 0 pei spectrum the band at 2962 cm 1 and 2846 cm 1 can be assigned to the ch stretching that came from the methylene ch2 branch of the pei 27 meanwhile the broad band centered at 3381 cm 1 can be attributed to the presence of carboxylic group cooh formed in pa thin film 28 29 similarly the 1445 cm 1 aromatic ring band noticed from 0 3 pei 0 5 pei 0 7 pei and 1 0 pip spectra showing the presence of cooh group 30 this occurrence can be related to hydrolysis of carbonyl halide group of tmc that make piperazine based pa layer embodied abundance of carboxylic acid groups 31 it is also worth noting that in the case of loading mixture between amine monomers of pei pip used in this study the interfacial polymerization reaction with tmc was more favoured towards pip due to its smaller molecular size higher reactivity and mobility as compared to pei this explains the spectra trend of 0 3 pei 0 5 pei and 0 7 pei that were more likely to follow the spectrum of 1 0 pip membrane to further confirm the formation of pa layer with different composition of pei pip a new stretching amide i band at 1619 cm 1 can be used to differentiate those of 0 3 pei 0 5 pei 0 7 pei and 1 0 pip membranes from psf substrate the intensity of the bands stretching showed an increasing trend from 0 3 pei 0 7 pei 0 5 pei to 1 0 pip thus proving that the composite membranes are of different composition loadings 3 1 2 surface and cross section morphology sem fig 3 shows the surface and cross sectional morphologies of tfc membranes observed under sem fig 3 a1 which represents 1 0 pei tfc shows the classical ridge and valley morphological structure of pa layer 31 this indicates the thin film polyethyleneimine based pa layer had been successfully formed on top of the psf substrate via interfacial polymerization meanwhile the 1 0 pip and 0 3 pei tfcs in fig 3 b1 and c2 portray nodular structures normally seen on the surface pa layer that formed when pip monomer is used the structures is a result of high degree aqueous organic monomers cross linking matching the piperazine based pa layer properties in other studies 26 27 in addition to the micrographs obtained it is observed that the globules are also present on the 0 5 pei and 0 7 pei surfaces indicating the formation of pip amide skin and translucent layer of pei amide skin formed on top of it from the cross sectional morphologies of both 1 0 pei and 1 0 pip in fig 3 a2 and b2 respectively it is confirmed that the pa layer has been formed on the top of the membrane substrate meanwhile from fig 3 c2 e2 the thickness of pa skin layer of 0 3 pei 0 5 pei 0 7 pei increased with the thickness value of 53 nm 70 8 nm 108 nm respectively in addition the thickness of pa skin displayed in fig 3 a2 and b2 is around 70 8 88 nm and 62 88 5 nm for 1 0 pei and 1 0 pip respectively the thickness of both pa skins ranging between 50 nm to 76 7 nm showed close agreement to previous study 32 it is observed that the overall thickness finger like structure and non woven fabric of both membranes is 145 6 186 2 μm from these observations it can be concluded that both types of membranes have almost similar thickness due to the same preparation method 3 1 3 surface roughness the surface roughness of tfc membranes prepared from this study is showed in fig 4 it can be seen that addition of pei as monomer resulted to rougher surface theoretically a rougher surface would have a higher surface area and provide a larger contactable surface with water thus higher water flux from the results it is evident that 1 0 pei tfc presents a rougher surface compared to others and all polyamide skin of individual and combination of amine monomer were successfully formed on the surface of the psf substrate the rougher surface of 1 0 pei can be linked to the reaction of tmc with the hyperbranched amine structures of pei resulting in high degree formation of nodules and ridge valley structures 3 1 4 surface charge zeta potential fig 5 compares the surface zeta potential of the produced tfc membranes prepared using different composition of pei pip mixture from fig 5 it is observed that at ph 7 0 the zeta potential increased when the loading of pei increased from 9 01 mv 1 0 pip to 22 mv 1 0 pei the same trend was reported by wu et al 26 when comparing the isoelectric point of each the tfcs that they have produced it is worth noticing that when a small amount of pip was present along with majority pei for interfacial polymerization with tmc the surface charge of the membrane was at its peak this was due to the dominant effect of the reaction between pip and tmc making pip as the limiting reagent since pip naturally present as a smaller molecule compared to pei it is easier for pip to be absorbed by tmc rather than pei making the interfacial polymerization favours the pip tmc reaction in effect this will cause more primary amines in pei left unreacted resulting in more positive charges on the membrane surface 3 1 5 pure water flux and membrane hydrophilicity fig 6 shows the nf s performances of the prepared tfcs in term of pure water flux and contact angle from the figure it can be seen that the contact angle increased in such way that 1 0 pei 1 0 pip 0 3 pei 0 5 pei 0 7 pei the hydrophilicity of 1 0 pei is confirmed to be the highest since it demonstrates the highest pure water flux it is also found that the trend of water flux not following the order of pei loading ratio in which this could be ascribed to the phenomenon where in a solution containing pip and pei pip which has faster reaction with tmc and may penetrate first and forming pa layer leaving pei molecules unreacted as supported by afm analysis the pa layer made of pei only results to rough surface area since the surface of 0 7 pei is smoother than 0 5 pei we presumed that there was tendency that only smaller amount of pei reacted with tmc in 0 7 pei tfc membrane as compared to 0 5 pei tfc membrane for the case of 1 0 pei besides the improved membrane hydrophilicity the increment of water flux may also be attributed to the rougher membrane surface of 1 0 pei as confirmed by afm analysis in which the formation of ridge valleys structures results in higher surface area consequently more water molecules are promoted to pass through the membrane 3 2 tfc nf performance evaluation fig 7 a shows the copper rejection by pip pei tfc membranes it is discovered that the rejection was the highest when no mixture of amine monomer is present this suggests that when the amine monomer used was fully either pip or pei the pa layer formed was able to effectively reject the charged metal ion given by the results that 1 0 pei was the highest and 1 0 pip the second highest this can be explained due to charge repulsion by donnan exclusion in rejecting ionic solutes 34 since the 1 0 pei tfc is positively charged referring to zeta potential analysis in fig 5 it appears that the copper ions which carry the same charge as the membrane surface charge are being repulsive toward the membrane surface thus high cu rejection at 94 78 was obtained on the other hand in the case of 1 0 pip 82 42 cu retention is mainly contributed by the negatively charged pa layer in which create possibly from the electric double layer effect 35 since the membrane surface charge is negative the positive metal ions are attracted to the surface and create the first layer the charge repulsion occurs when the positive metal ions get concentrated over the first layer by attraction of opposite charges and then repulsed the rest of the metallic ions this effect may take some time and reduced the effectiveness of that cu rejection as for that the positively charged surface is more favourable to reject cations through charge charge repulsion 36 concurrently it is found that for the mixed amine tfcs the cu retention increases as the content of pei increases this can be supported by zeta potential analysis where membranes gradually behave like 1 0 pei in terms of their surface charges when the content of pei in the pei pip ratio increases from the zeta potential analysis only 0 7 pei and 1 0 pei were positively charged whilst the other two 0 3 pei and 0 5 pei were negatively charged as per mentioned before positively charged membrane provides double layer repulsion in no time and resulting to 1 0 pei to outperform the other two tfcs in terms of the cu rejection consequences of the tfcs surface charge are further discussed based on the result of the membrane autopsy form edx refer fig 7b based on dispersion of cu it can be observed that increasing loading of pei resulted to lower attachment of cu ions owing to their higher positive charge value it is noteworthy to remark on the quantity of copper attached on the surface of 1 0 pip and 1 0 pei each having the highest 2 0 wt and the lowest 0 38 wt respectively compared to the other tfcs from the data it is confirmed that donnan exclusion by charge attraction and repulsion plays a significant role on the rejection mechanism of the tfcs 3 3 tfc fo performance evaluation the intrinsic surface charge of the produced tfc membranes and its effect on copper rejection and how surface charge interaction dominantly plays its role in the rejection of the cu ii ion has been studied using the nf system consecutively out of the five 5 tfcs the best two in term of cu ii rejection by nf which are 1 0 pip and 1 0 pei were tested for their performances in fo system and the results of water flux cu ii rejection and reverse solute flux rsf are presented as in table 2 it can be seen that the water flux demonstrated by 1 0 pip was 1 3 lmh higher than that of 1 0 pei these outcomes might be attributed to the hydrophilicity of the individual tfc membrane as shown previously in fig 6 the performances of the tested tfc fo membranes were accomplished using 1 0 m mgcl2 draw solution and 1000 ppm cu ii solution as the feed with both tfcs were in al fs configuration from table 2 it is revealed that the rsf by 1 0 pei was 0 0081 g m2hr lower compared to 1 0 pip both of the obtained rsf however can be assumed considerably low since the concentration of the draw solution employed was only 1 0 m lower than usual practice by other researchers interestingly it is worthy to highlight the rejection of cu ii by both 1 0 pip and 1 0 pei membranes both of the negatively charged 1 0 pip and positively charged 1 0 pei exhibited relatively excellent rejection 99 and there is no significant difference between those two types of membranes when comparing to the rejection by nf it is obvious that the rejection by nf were not as good as the rejection by fo despite using the same membranes this situation can be explained by relating the presence of applied pressure on the both systems since fo does not require any hydraulic pressure to the feed less solutes are able to penetrate the membrane thus it is intrinsic that fo has the upper hand in terms of rejection of hyper saline or complicated feed water 37 4 conclusion in this study the application of fo with the help of the surface charge tfc was investigated a series of five tfc membranes having unique surface charges were synthesized the physicochemical properties of the membranes and the rejection of copper ion by both nf and fo systems were compared and discussed the results showed that positively charged tfc membrane enhanced the rejection heavy metal cu ii ion with the help of charge repulsion under nf operation interestingly the charge interaction showed some effect on the rejection of metal ions but due to the inherently non pressurized system of fo both of the 1 0 pip and 1 0 pei had relatively comparable excellent rejection under the fo process in which 1 0 pip having slightly higher

14166,this study aimed to investigate the effects of cooperative membrane surface charge of thin film composite tfc membranes for removal of cu ii from aqueous solution using nanofiltration nf and forward osmosis fo process a total of five composite membranes with different piperazine polyethyleneimine pip pei ratio 1 0 pip 0 3 pei 0 5 pei 0 7 pei 1 0 pei were fabricated and the physicochemical properties of these membranes were characterized using scanning electron microscope sem attenuated total reflection fourier transform infra red atr ftir zeta potential and contact angle analysis physicochemical analysis confirmed the formation of polyamide pa layer for all tfc membranes result of zeta potential analysis revealed that 1 0 pei is positively charged surface whereas 1 0 pip is negatively charged consequently 1 0 pei exhibits higher flux compared to 1 0 pip owing to its higher hydrophilicity interestingly 1 0 pei demonstrates the highest copper cu ii ion rejection of more than 95 and 99 in nf and fo operation respectively outperforming the other produced tfcs result of the elemental diffraction x ray edx further explained that the copper rejection was facilitated by the cooperative surface charge keywords surface charge thin film composite forward osmosis 1 introduction heavy metal ions are generally known to be non degradable and bio accumulative in human bodies 1 2 copper cu a common heavy metal ion is widely used in industries particularly electroplating etching metal finishing pigment and alloy manufacturing 3 4 despite cu playing an important role in human biochemistry only minimal traces level of cu is needed in human body 5 whereas excessive exposure of cu could lead to liver damage wilson disease and insomnia 6 in addition the european union has included cu as the grey list back in 1976 as list of hazardous materials in which their content in the disposal to be reduced 7 precipitation activated carbon adsorption ion exchange membrane filtration and hybrid system are among known methods for disposal of metal ions from wastewater 8 13 however some of these methods possess several drawbacks including requirement of high energy and chemicals selective removal and generation of toxic secondary waste 14 despite these disadvantages membrane technology continued to gain significant attention among researchers due to its high efficacy and advantages for industrial implementation 15 17 in general membrane acts as a selective barrier which allows the passage of certain constituents whilst inhibits the passage of other constituents based on steric size exclusion mechanism the common membrane processes can be classified into microfiltration mf ultrafiltration uf nanofiltration nf reverse osmosis ro and forward osmosis fo in which the first two are often use microporous membrane while the latter three use thin composite membrane with selective dense layer due to the smaller sizes of the hydrated metal ions eg cd2 0 86 nm pb2 0 80 nm cu2 0 84 and zn2 0 86 nm separation mechanism by steric exclusion alone using microporous membrane is ineffective 18 throughout the years studies have progressed into introducing selective dense layer typically polyamide pa layer on top of the membrane support layer or its substrate to produce a thin film composite tfc 16 the presence of this dense layer facilitates the rejection of small size contaminants by size exclusion mechanism many studies have incorporated nanoparticles to further improve the physicochemical properties and rejection of metal ions either into pa layer or substrate layer during fabrication of the thin film nanocomposite tfn in which rejection of metal ions is enhanced through donnan exclusion or charge interaction 18 20 to date most of the studies on the effect of membrane surface charge have been focused on reverse osmosis ro 21 ultrafiltration uf 22 and nanofiltration nf membrane 23 however very few studies have been done on forward osmosis fo it is suggested that membrane surface charge plays role in the separation of metal ions due to the electrostatic interaction 18 24 thus this study aims to justify the effects of membrane surface charge in removing cu ii ions from synthetic wastewater using nf and fo processes to observe this the tfc membranes were fabricated by using different loading ratio of piperazine pip with polyethyleneimine pei to confirm that pa is successfully fabricated physicochemical properties of the membranes such as surface functional groups surface and cross sectional morphologies surface roughness and surface charge need to be evaluated to ensure successful pa fabrication the performances of fo and nf processes were compared after fo process was performed 2 experimental 2 1 materials the commercial uf polysulfone psf membrane model us020 manufactured by rising sun membrane technology co ltd with mwco of 20 000 da was used as the support layer for fabrication of pa layer by interfacial polymerization piperazine pip sigma aldrich polyethyleneimine pei acros organic trimesoyl chloride tmc sigma aldrich and n hexane merck were used for the feed and draw solution cuso4 and mgcl2 pellets purchased from sigma aldrich were used 2 2 thin film composite tfc preparation via interfacial polymerization prior to the pa layer preparation on psf substrate by interfacial polymerization psf substrates were immersed in di water overnight the wetted substrates were then attached onto a glass plate and the excess water was gently removed aqueous solution of 2 w v pei was poured onto the substrate for 2 25 min and then the excess pei was removed and air dried at 37 c for 10 min next the substrate was immersed in 0 1 w v of tmc in n hexane for 1 5 min subsequently the excess tmc was removed and oven dried at curing temperature of 60 c for 5 min finally the produced tfc was rinsed stored in di water for further usage and denoted as 1 0 pei similar procedure was repeated using different ratio composition of pei over pip as referred in table 1 with the exception of the 1 0 pip for preparation of pa layer using pip as the aqueous monomer the psf substrate was immersed in aqueous solution of 2 w v pip for 2 min when the excess pip solution was removed the membrane was rubber rolled until no water droplets were observed next the substrate was immersed in 0 1 w v of tmc in n hexane for 1 min and subsequently the excess tmc was removed and oven dried at curing temperature of 60 c for 5 min 2 3 tfc membranes characterization the surface of the active layer and the cross sectional morphologies of the thin film composite membranes with magnifications of 10k and 15k were examined using a scanning electron microscopy sem hitachi tm3000 japan for cross sectional observation all samples were fractured in liquid nitrogen and dried inside a desiccator the surface functional groups of all membrane samples were determined by using atr ftir spectrometer irtrace shimadzu each sample was scanned at wavelength 500 cm 1 to 4000 cm 1 with a total scanning of 600 times the surface roughness of membrane was evaluated by using atomic force microscopy afm dfm spa 300 hv in dynamic force mode in order to obtain the mean surface roughness ra each sample was observed under afm within the scan size of 2 μm x 2 μm the water contact angle for the determination of tfc membranes hydrophilicity was analysed by using sessile drop method a goniometer oca 15 pro dataphysics equipped with motor driven syringe was used to draw out 0 50 μl droplet of di water to be contacted with the surface of the dried membranes at room temperature at least 10 readings from different surface locations were taken and the average values were calculated and presented for accurate consistency in order to determine the nature of the membrane surface charge streaming potential measurement was carried out using an anton paar zeta potential analyser malvern uk model malvern zetasizer nano zsp water ph 7 was used as dispersant at 25 c in addition membrane autopsy was carried out after all of tfcs were tested to reject copper ion using nanofiltration system the reason for the autopsy was to determine percentage of copper traces wt that have been deposited on top of the surface of the tfc after post treatment with the nf the post mortem was carried out using energy dispersive x ray analyzer edx a built in function by the sem analyser hitachi tm3000 japan prior to the analysis the membrane sections were dissected about 1 cm2 and kept inside a desiccator 2 4 nanofiltration performance test prior of fo process the performance of fabricated membranes were firstly evaluated using a cross flow nanofiltration nf system from this experiment the best two 2 tfc membranes will be used for the fo test prior to the test aqueous cuso4 containing 200 ppm cu ii ion was prepared each membrane sample was mounted inside the membrane test cell with an effective area of 20 6 cm2 250 ml of cuso4 feed solution was poured into the feed tank pressure is maintained at 5 bars for the first 30 min for membrane compression and subsequently reduced to 4 bars and the permeate samples were collected three times at 15 min intervals a bench conductivity meter jenway 4520 was used to measure the ions concentration of before and after filtration whilst the cu ii ion concentration in the permeate was precisely measured using aas analyser model aa 7000 shimadzu the cu ii rejection was determined using the following equation 1 r 1 c p c f x 100 where cp is the copper concentration ppm in permeate and cf is the feed copper concentration ppm respectively 2 5 forward osmosis performance test the rejection test was performed with a bench scale cross flow fo system sterlitech cfo42p fo equipped with two 2 peristaltic pumps a membrane cell mounting with an effective area of 0 0042 m2 and an electronic balance placed under the draw solution tank fig 1 all tests were conducted at room temperature 25 c the speed of the pumps was maintained at 1800 rpm and the volume of the feed solution and the draw solution were fixed at 500 ml and 250 ml respectively the fo experiment was carried out to evaluate the performance of the two distinct charged membranes with highest rejection chosen from the earlier nf test aqueous cuso4 solution containing 1000 ppm cu ii ion was used as feed and 1 0 m of aqueous mgcl2 was used as the draw agent in terms of the membrane orientation all tests were conducted in active layer facing feed solution al fs configuration for fo process the mass change of the draw solution mgcl2 and concentration change of the feed solution cuso4 were recorded constantly at 20 minutes time intervals based on the data obtained the fo water flux fw l m2 h and reverse solute flux rsf g m2 h were calculated using formula 2 and 3 respectively meanwhile the cu ii rejection by fo was determined using the same eq 1 however the cp which is the concentration of permeated cu ii ion in draw solution sample was analysed by using aas 2 f w δ m δ t 1 a m 3 r s f c t v t c 0 v 0 a m δ t where in eq 2 δ m is the change in mass g of the draw solution whereas δ t is the difference of final second and the initial time and a m is the effective membrane area in m2 in the calculation of reverse solute flux eq 3 c 0 a n d v 0 are the initial concentration and initial volume of the draw solution respectively while c t a n d v t are the concentration and volume of the draw solution at predetermined t i m e 20 m i n u t e s 3 results and discussion 3 1 physicochemical properties of tfc 3 1 1 organic functional groups atr ftir the chemical functional groups on the top surface of the composite membranes were analysed via atr ftir analysis fig 2 shows the atr ftir spectra of the pristine psf membrane and composite membranes with different amine monomers which are pei pip and the ratio composition between the two aforementioned monomers from the figure it is confirmed that the polyamide pa layer has been successfully formed on top of the substrate when compared to the pristine psf membrane absence of pa layer spectra two new peaks appeared at 1652 cm 1 and 1559 cm 1 stipulating the characteristic of amide i co stretching and amide ii nh bands 25 26 though the appearance of bending at 1559 cm 1 is not strong due to the overlapping of other common functional groups it is however justifiable when the two spectra of 1 0 pei and pristine psf membrane were compared at that particular wavenumber there was a slight slanting slope over the 1 0 pei spectrum observed as compared to the steep one belonged to the pristine spectrum furthermore from 1 0 pei spectrum the band at 2962 cm 1 and 2846 cm 1 can be assigned to the ch stretching that came from the methylene ch2 branch of the pei 27 meanwhile the broad band centered at 3381 cm 1 can be attributed to the presence of carboxylic group cooh formed in pa thin film 28 29 similarly the 1445 cm 1 aromatic ring band noticed from 0 3 pei 0 5 pei 0 7 pei and 1 0 pip spectra showing the presence of cooh group 30 this occurrence can be related to hydrolysis of carbonyl halide group of tmc that make piperazine based pa layer embodied abundance of carboxylic acid groups 31 it is also worth noting that in the case of loading mixture between amine monomers of pei pip used in this study the interfacial polymerization reaction with tmc was more favoured towards pip due to its smaller molecular size higher reactivity and mobility as compared to pei this explains the spectra trend of 0 3 pei 0 5 pei and 0 7 pei that were more likely to follow the spectrum of 1 0 pip membrane to further confirm the formation of pa layer with different composition of pei pip a new stretching amide i band at 1619 cm 1 can be used to differentiate those of 0 3 pei 0 5 pei 0 7 pei and 1 0 pip membranes from psf substrate the intensity of the bands stretching showed an increasing trend from 0 3 pei 0 7 pei 0 5 pei to 1 0 pip thus proving that the composite membranes are of different composition loadings 3 1 2 surface and cross section morphology sem fig 3 shows the surface and cross sectional morphologies of tfc membranes observed under sem fig 3 a1 which represents 1 0 pei tfc shows the classical ridge and valley morphological structure of pa layer 31 this indicates the thin film polyethyleneimine based pa layer had been successfully formed on top of the psf substrate via interfacial polymerization meanwhile the 1 0 pip and 0 3 pei tfcs in fig 3 b1 and c2 portray nodular structures normally seen on the surface pa layer that formed when pip monomer is used the structures is a result of high degree aqueous organic monomers cross linking matching the piperazine based pa layer properties in other studies 26 27 in addition to the micrographs obtained it is observed that the globules are also present on the 0 5 pei and 0 7 pei surfaces indicating the formation of pip amide skin and translucent layer of pei amide skin formed on top of it from the cross sectional morphologies of both 1 0 pei and 1 0 pip in fig 3 a2 and b2 respectively it is confirmed that the pa layer has been formed on the top of the membrane substrate meanwhile from fig 3 c2 e2 the thickness of pa skin layer of 0 3 pei 0 5 pei 0 7 pei increased with the thickness value of 53 nm 70 8 nm 108 nm respectively in addition the thickness of pa skin displayed in fig 3 a2 and b2 is around 70 8 88 nm and 62 88 5 nm for 1 0 pei and 1 0 pip respectively the thickness of both pa skins ranging between 50 nm to 76 7 nm showed close agreement to previous study 32 it is observed that the overall thickness finger like structure and non woven fabric of both membranes is 145 6 186 2 μm from these observations it can be concluded that both types of membranes have almost similar thickness due to the same preparation method 3 1 3 surface roughness the surface roughness of tfc membranes prepared from this study is showed in fig 4 it can be seen that addition of pei as monomer resulted to rougher surface theoretically a rougher surface would have a higher surface area and provide a larger contactable surface with water thus higher water flux from the results it is evident that 1 0 pei tfc presents a rougher surface compared to others and all polyamide skin of individual and combination of amine monomer were successfully formed on the surface of the psf substrate the rougher surface of 1 0 pei can be linked to the reaction of tmc with the hyperbranched amine structures of pei resulting in high degree formation of nodules and ridge valley structures 3 1 4 surface charge zeta potential fig 5 compares the surface zeta potential of the produced tfc membranes prepared using different composition of pei pip mixture from fig 5 it is observed that at ph 7 0 the zeta potential increased when the loading of pei increased from 9 01 mv 1 0 pip to 22 mv 1 0 pei the same trend was reported by wu et al 26 when comparing the isoelectric point of each the tfcs that they have produced it is worth noticing that when a small amount of pip was present along with majority pei for interfacial polymerization with tmc the surface charge of the membrane was at its peak this was due to the dominant effect of the reaction between pip and tmc making pip as the limiting reagent since pip naturally present as a smaller molecule compared to pei it is easier for pip to be absorbed by tmc rather than pei making the interfacial polymerization favours the pip tmc reaction in effect this will cause more primary amines in pei left unreacted resulting in more positive charges on the membrane surface 3 1 5 pure water flux and membrane hydrophilicity fig 6 shows the nf s performances of the prepared tfcs in term of pure water flux and contact angle from the figure it can be seen that the contact angle increased in such way that 1 0 pei 1 0 pip 0 3 pei 0 5 pei 0 7 pei the hydrophilicity of 1 0 pei is confirmed to be the highest since it demonstrates the highest pure water flux it is also found that the trend of water flux not following the order of pei loading ratio in which this could be ascribed to the phenomenon where in a solution containing pip and pei pip which has faster reaction with tmc and may penetrate first and forming pa layer leaving pei molecules unreacted as supported by afm analysis the pa layer made of pei only results to rough surface area since the surface of 0 7 pei is smoother than 0 5 pei we presumed that there was tendency that only smaller amount of pei reacted with tmc in 0 7 pei tfc membrane as compared to 0 5 pei tfc membrane for the case of 1 0 pei besides the improved membrane hydrophilicity the increment of water flux may also be attributed to the rougher membrane surface of 1 0 pei as confirmed by afm analysis in which the formation of ridge valleys structures results in higher surface area consequently more water molecules are promoted to pass through the membrane 3 2 tfc nf performance evaluation fig 7 a shows the copper rejection by pip pei tfc membranes it is discovered that the rejection was the highest when no mixture of amine monomer is present this suggests that when the amine monomer used was fully either pip or pei the pa layer formed was able to effectively reject the charged metal ion given by the results that 1 0 pei was the highest and 1 0 pip the second highest this can be explained due to charge repulsion by donnan exclusion in rejecting ionic solutes 34 since the 1 0 pei tfc is positively charged referring to zeta potential analysis in fig 5 it appears that the copper ions which carry the same charge as the membrane surface charge are being repulsive toward the membrane surface thus high cu rejection at 94 78 was obtained on the other hand in the case of 1 0 pip 82 42 cu retention is mainly contributed by the negatively charged pa layer in which create possibly from the electric double layer effect 35 since the membrane surface charge is negative the positive metal ions are attracted to the surface and create the first layer the charge repulsion occurs when the positive metal ions get concentrated over the first layer by attraction of opposite charges and then repulsed the rest of the metallic ions this effect may take some time and reduced the effectiveness of that cu rejection as for that the positively charged surface is more favourable to reject cations through charge charge repulsion 36 concurrently it is found that for the mixed amine tfcs the cu retention increases as the content of pei increases this can be supported by zeta potential analysis where membranes gradually behave like 1 0 pei in terms of their surface charges when the content of pei in the pei pip ratio increases from the zeta potential analysis only 0 7 pei and 1 0 pei were positively charged whilst the other two 0 3 pei and 0 5 pei were negatively charged as per mentioned before positively charged membrane provides double layer repulsion in no time and resulting to 1 0 pei to outperform the other two tfcs in terms of the cu rejection consequences of the tfcs surface charge are further discussed based on the result of the membrane autopsy form edx refer fig 7b based on dispersion of cu it can be observed that increasing loading of pei resulted to lower attachment of cu ions owing to their higher positive charge value it is noteworthy to remark on the quantity of copper attached on the surface of 1 0 pip and 1 0 pei each having the highest 2 0 wt and the lowest 0 38 wt respectively compared to the other tfcs from the data it is confirmed that donnan exclusion by charge attraction and repulsion plays a significant role on the rejection mechanism of the tfcs 3 3 tfc fo performance evaluation the intrinsic surface charge of the produced tfc membranes and its effect on copper rejection and how surface charge interaction dominantly plays its role in the rejection of the cu ii ion has been studied using the nf system consecutively out of the five 5 tfcs the best two in term of cu ii rejection by nf which are 1 0 pip and 1 0 pei were tested for their performances in fo system and the results of water flux cu ii rejection and reverse solute flux rsf are presented as in table 2 it can be seen that the water flux demonstrated by 1 0 pip was 1 3 lmh higher than that of 1 0 pei these outcomes might be attributed to the hydrophilicity of the individual tfc membrane as shown previously in fig 6 the performances of the tested tfc fo membranes were accomplished using 1 0 m mgcl2 draw solution and 1000 ppm cu ii solution as the feed with both tfcs were in al fs configuration from table 2 it is revealed that the rsf by 1 0 pei was 0 0081 g m2hr lower compared to 1 0 pip both of the obtained rsf however can be assumed considerably low since the concentration of the draw solution employed was only 1 0 m lower than usual practice by other researchers interestingly it is worthy to highlight the rejection of cu ii by both 1 0 pip and 1 0 pei membranes both of the negatively charged 1 0 pip and positively charged 1 0 pei exhibited relatively excellent rejection 99 and there is no significant difference between those two types of membranes when comparing to the rejection by nf it is

charged tfc membrane enhanced the rejection heavy metal cu ii ion with the help of charge repulsion under nf operation interestingly the charge interaction showed some effect on the rejection of metal ions but due to the inherently non pressurized system of fo both of the 1 0 pip and 1 0 pei had relatively comparable excellent rejection under the fo process in which 1 0 pip having slightly higher

14167,this study investigates the rejection of pharmaceutically active compounds phacs by nanofiltration nf reverse osmosis ro and membrane distillation md the doce river located in minas gerais brazil geographical coordinates 18 51 50 45 s and 41 56 46 86 w which is used for drinking water catching and raw sewage disposal was chosen as the background matrix for this study betamethasone and fluconazole among the 28 assessed phacs were the most recurrent during monitoring the results show that the phacs rejection by nf and ro membranes decreases as the permeate recovery rate rr increases the first phac occurrence in the permeate happened at 40 and 60 rr for nf and ro respectively md showed a rejection 99 for both fluconazole and betamethasone for up to 70 rr nf and ro reject phacs mainly through size exclusion and hydrophobic interactions whereas md rejects phacs due to their low volatility all evaluated processes lead to a toxicological risk reduction md did not show any tendency of fouling while nf and ro show flux decline mainly due to membrane fouling which was more evident in ro the membrane fouling occurred due to deposition and or pore blocking by natural organic matter since the water salts concentration is low opex was estimated at 0 50 0 43 and 1 96 us m3 for nf ro and md respectively although the md process is more robust the practical application is restricted by the high cost and nf and ro are feasible alternatives to remove phacs from drinking water keywords pharmaceutically active compounds nanofiltration reverse osmosis membrane distillation drinking water treatment 1 introduction more than 200 pharmaceutically active compounds phacs have been detected in varying concentrations ng l to μg l in surface ground water and sewage and have been recognized as potential environmental threats 1 3 phacs have been attracting global attention due to increase in their production usage continuous discharge to the environment as well as potential ecological effects 4 additionally their actual effects and interactions with the environment are still not well known and understood a large spectrum of pollutants from industrial and domestic effluents as well as farming activities arrive to conventional wastewater treatment plants wwtps these facilities are designed to remove organic matter and nutrients in the order of g l to mg l and thus the complete removal of phacs by a conventional wwtp is challenging due to several factors such as low volatility hydrophobicity complex structures and extremely low concentrations 5 consequently phacs are discharged into waterbodies as they are not completely eliminated during the treatment processes 6 previous studies have reported the adverse effects of phacs such as human wildlife reproduction disorders and the appearance of antibiotic resistant bacteria on non target organisms after their release into the environment 7 8 additionally it is known that releasing estrogenic pharmaceuticals into water bodies can interfere with sex differentiation thereby reducing or increasing fertility 9 the physicochemical properties of phacs favor their persistence in the environment propensity for bioaccumulation in living organisms and capability to be transformed into products after natural oxidative processes 10 therefore environmental risk assessment should be conducted in this regard moreover it has been reported that some phacs persist through treatment processes at drinking water treatment plants dwtps due to their small size and polarity which makes them highly water soluble mobile and extremely difficult to remove by conventional treatments 11 12 thus phacs are likely to be detrimental to humans as they can return to the human body through water cycle and food chain 13 therefore considering the possibility of inadvertent exposure to phacs via drinking water it is important to assess their consequent risks to human health considering the limitations associated with conventional treatment processes the need to achieve removal of phacs has led to alternative technologies such as membrane separation processes msps 4 14 19 msps such as membrane distillation md reverse osmosis ro and nanofiltration nf have been successfully applied either as a single process or as a combination of different membrane techniques at pilot and full scale installations in domestic or industrial wastewater reclamation to achieve a high quality permeate by efficiently removing a large spectrum of pollutants microorganisms salts organic micropollutants proteins sugars and inorganic ions nf and ro processes have demonstrated promising results for treatment of phacs and other emerging micropollutants 4 20 despite incomplete removal of ions nf presents a greater permeate flux and is able to work at lower pressures it is expected to show effective removal of organic pollutants 21 especially phacs since a majority of them have molecular weights within 150 500 da and the molecular weight cut off mwco for most commercial nf membranes ranges from about 100 to 2000 da 22 previous studies have indicated that steric hindrance effects by these membranes are the predominant phenomenon for rejection of phacs 23 the electrostatic effect is also significant in rejection of charged pharmaceutical compounds which explains the high rejection of negatively charged phacs by loose nf 24 and ro membranes exceeding 95 25 in addition almost all phacs can physically and or chemically interact with the membrane material leading to their adsorption onto the membrane and potentially impacting their rejection 11 md is a low temperature distillation process that operates by transporting water in vapor phase through a microporous and hydrophobic membrane to the distillate side theoretically this process shows 100 retention of non volatile components due to the temperature difference between the feed and distillate sides only the most volatile compounds typically water vaporize to pass through the pore openings at the feed membrane interface and subsequently condense at the distillate membrane interface direct contact membrane distillation is considered the most widely studied md system configuration due to its simple operation 26 md is less susceptible to membrane incrustation than pressure membrane processes since the latter are subject to hydraulic pressure moreover even when a fouling layer is formed on the membrane surface it is expected to be less compact and can be easily removed 27 wijekoon et al 28 studied the application of md for removing phacs during water and wastewater treatment the results suggested that the rejection and fate of phacs during md were governed by their volatility and hydrophobicity all phacs with pkh 9 were completely removed several studies 4 14 17 18 have evaluated and compared the application of nf and ro however only a few studies 27 29 have focused on the application of md in removing phacs from water and wastewater moreover most studies have been carried out using synthetic or spiked solutions therefore studies that focus on the application of msps to real water matrixes while dealing with real concentrations in the order of ng l to μg l and their complex matrices are still needed this allows for improvement of the treatment efficiency by reducing membrane fouling and energy requirements additionally it helps understand the rejection mechanisms and interactions between the membrane and the phacs to help establish the most effective operational systems to produce safe potable water therefore the aim of this study was to compare nf ro and md technologies in terms of their technical and economic performances with regard to the removal of phacs from a real water matrix 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area and sample collection the present study was conducted with water samples collected from doce river located at governador valadares in minas gerais brazil

glass and a flow channel was engraved in each of the two acrylic glass blocks that made up the feed and permeate the semi cells the feed solution was circulated from a glass reservoir to the membrane cell and then returned to the feed reservoir using the same procedure according to couto et al 36 fig 2 feed temperature was maintained by a hot plate the temperature of the distillate was regulated

concentrations of phacs in the distillate were corrected for dilution by accounting for the initial volume of milli q water in the distillate the duration of each md experiment was approximately 13 h

concentrations of metals k mg2 ca2 and na were quantified by atomic absorption spectrometry atomic absorption spectrophotometer gbc avanta 2 6 environmental and human health risk assessment the potential environmental risks of phacs were evaluated based on the hazard quotient hq values hq values were calculated for acute and chronic effects by dividing the measured environmental concentration with the predicted no effect concentration pnec which was determined by dividing the mean effect or lethal concentration ec50 or lc50 and the non observed effect concentration by safety factors whose typical values as reported in literature are 1000 and 10 respectively 37 for hq calculation the lowest pnec values were considered to obtain the worst case scenario the mixture toxicity was estimated by using the classical concentration addition model to calculate mixture hazard quotients mhq the risk was classified into the following categories high risk mhq 1 medium risk 0 1 mhq 1 low risk 0 01 mhq 0 1 and negligible risk mhq 0 01 38 to assess the impact on public health the margin of exposure was calculated by comparing the concentration of each phac in treated water samples to its concentration below which the probability of adverse effects as a result of long term lifetime exposure are negligible tolerable daily intake tdi which was derived from the non observed adverse effect level noael and a safety factor of 100 was used to estimate the safe exposure levels 37 tdi values for each phac were selected from literature or derived from noael 39 2 7 calculations the volumetric permeate fluxes l m 2 h 1 for nf j n f and ro j r o were calculated using eq 1 as follows 1 j n f j r o δ v p a m δ t where a m is the effective membrane area δ v p is the permeate volume collected and δ t is the collection time flux normalization at 25 c was accomplished by means of a correction factor related to the fluid viscosity according to eq 2 2 j 25 c δ v p a m δ t μ t μ 25 c where j 25 c is the normalized permeate flux at 25 c μ t is the water viscosity at the process temperature and μ 25 c is the water viscosity at 25 c the permeate recovery ratio r r n f and r r r o can be defined by eq 3 3 r r n f r r r o v p v f 100 where v p corresponds to the accumulated volume of permeate and v f to the initial volume of the feed for the md system the permeate flux j p m d was calculated according to eq 4 4 j p m d m d i m d f a m t i t f where m d i and m d f correspond to the mass kg of the initial and final distillate respectively a m is the area of the membrane m2 and t i and t f correspond to the initial and final times respectively the recovery rate r r m d is calculated by eq 5 5 r r m d m d f m d i m f i 100 where m f i corresponds to the mass kg of the initial feed the observed rejection was calculated using eq 6 as follows 6 r e j e c t i o n c f c p c f 100 where cf and cp represent the solute content in the feed and permeate streams respectively phacs losses during the md experiments were calculated by considering the mass balance of each analyzed compound in the feed concentrate and distillate as given in eq 7 7 c f x v f c d x v d c c x v c t o t a l l o s s where cf cd and cc are concentrations in the feed distillate and concentrate respectively similarly vf vd and vc are the feed distillate and concentrate volumes respectively according to the simplified resistance in series model the total filtration resistance could be divided into membrane resistance r m and fouling resistance r f r m was determined from eq 8 8 r m 1 k μ 25 c where k is the membrane water permeability for each test it was obtained from the ratio of normalized permeate flux of pure water j w and applied pressures δp at 10 0 8 0 and 6 0 bar linearization r f was calculated based on the normalized effluent permeate flux j s d obtained near the end of each experiment eq 9 this resistance includes concentration polarization cp components adsorption on the membrane surface and scaling 9 r f δ p δ π μ 25 c j s d r m where δ p δ π is the process effective pressure i e applied pressure minus osmotic pressure the osmotic pressure difference was calculated using van t hoff equation eq 10 10 δ π i 0 n c c c p r t where r is the universal gas constant t is the permeation temperature in kelvin and the sum of the difference of the molar concentration of the main dissolved species that are present in the concentrate c c and permeate c p at each recuperation rate rr rf is a combination of reversible fouling rfr and irreversible fouling layer rfir 40 rfr results mostly due to deposition of a cake layer on the membrane surface which can be removed through physical cleaning such as water washing thus it can be controlled by adjusting the feed flow conditions rfir occurs due to adsorption onto membrane surface and into its pores and can be removed by chemical cleaning for the md resistance calculations i e membrane resistance r m feed boundary layer resistance r f b and permeate boundary layer resistance r p b 36 41 pressures and temperatures at the membrane surface were calculated according to couto et al 36 the total flux decline fd for all three processes was calculated as follows 11 f d j w j s d j w flux decline can be attributed to cp and fouling f thus the flux decline due to cp was obtained using eq 12 12 c p j p c j s d j w where jpc is the volumetric water flux of the physically cleaned membrane after effluent filtration the flux decline due to fouling was obtained using eq 13 13 f j w j p c j w the specific energy consumption sec for nf and ro was calculated from eq 14 and 15 42 14 s e c w p u m p q p 15 w p u m p δ p q f where w p u m p is the pump work rate kwh s δ is the difference between the feed pressure at the entrance of the membrane and the pressure of raw water which is assumed to be equal to the atmospheric pressure n m² and and are the feed and permeate flow rates m³ s respectively the permeate product water recovery for nf processes y can be defined using eq 16 as follows 16 y q p q f by combining eqs 14 15 and 16 the sec equation can be rewritten as follows 17 s e c δ p y energy consumptions for the md system are estimated both for heat cooling energy and for circulation of the streams the specific thermal energy consumption or stec kwh m3 was calculated according to qtaishat and banat 43 18 s t e c m f c f t f i n t f o u t j s d where m f is the feed flow rate c f is the specific heat of the feed 4 18 kj kg 1 k 1 t f is the temperature of the feed in t f i n and out t f

the md system experimental data 2 8 statistical evaluation due to the small quantity of data i e seven data points per test a non parametric statistical test was used kruskal wallis test was used to check for significant differences between the evaluated parameters and subsequently non parametric multiple comparisons were investigated among the groups α 5 statistica 8 0 software was used for all statistical analyses 2 9 preliminary investment and cost estimate a preliminary economic evaluation was conducted to estimate the capital and operational expenses capex and opex to treat doce river water by nf ro and md the variables considered were costs of membrane unit membrane replacement chemical cleaning agents energy consumption and system maintenance for nf and ro the membrane unit capital cost was based on a price provided by a major supplier of commercial membranes in brazil 8750 00 usd m3 h of effluent for md the membrane unit capital cost was considered to be 7680 00 u m3 h 44 it assumed one filtration stage and volumetric flows equal to the designed systems capacity q d e s of 0 04 m3 s to estimate the capital cost per cubic meter of effluent the capital cost was annualized by means of the amortization factor as presented in eq 20 45 20 a p i c 1 i c d l 1 i c d l 1 where a p is the amortization factor i c is the investment rate 14 in 2018 for brazil and dl is the design life of the plant the membrane systems design life was considered to be 15 years the capital cost per cubic meter was obtained from eq 21 21 c c a p m 3 c c a p a p q d e s where c c a p m 3 is the capital cost per cubic meter of effluent and c c a p is the system capital cost membrane replacement costs considered an average membrane lifespan of 5 years the permeate recovery rate was set at a value greater than one that provided phac concentrations below the method quantification limit mql for each assessed treatment nf ro and md membrane costs were provided by a large commercial membrane supplier as 50 40 and 60 us m² respectively the energy cost estimate comprised the assessed systems feed pump requirement and the thermal energy for heating the md feed solution a once through operation process was considered and the power requirement was estimated from eq 20 to 25 the energy tariff paid by the water production company in brazil is 0 04 us kwh at an exchange rate of r 1 us 0 25 the costs of chemicals for membrane cleaning and maintenance costs were estimated at 2 and 5 per year of the initial investment cost respectively 46 3 results and discussion 3 1 occurrence of phacs in doce river betamethasone anti inflammatory and fluconazole antifungal among the 28 assessed phacs evaluated were quantified in the water sample collected for this specific study table 3 november marks the beginning of the rainy season in brazil which propitiates increased fungal populations and may explain the higher fluconazole concentration table 4 shows the physical chemical properties and toxicity indicators of betamethasone and fluconazole in the water sample fluconazole concentrations were found to be significantly higher than the ones found in rivers in spain 28 5 ng l china 22 8 ng l and korea 46 2 ng l 49 51 betamethasone concentration was also higher than those found in the us and germany 52 53 according to vestel et al 53 the pharmaceutical assessment and transport evaluation model estimated betamethasone concentrations to be 0 6 ng l in 95 of all u s surface waters and in germany the concentrations were found to be between 0 07 and 2 8 ng l 54 the highest concentration observed in the doce river may be related to untreated sewage discharge the city governador valadares does not count with wastewater treatment coverage thus the sewage is released in natura in the river regardless both fluconazole and betamethasone pose negligible environmental risks hq 0 01 considering the mixture doce river water poses low toxicological risk as the mhq found owing to these two phacs was 0 011 for acute toxicity and 0 002 for chronic toxicity regarding human health risk the moe obtained was 2125 indicating low probability of risk therefore a specific screening of these two compounds in the membrane permeate was performed in order to assess the ability of nf ro and md to remove these phacs 3 2 membrane performance fouling propensity as expected ro membrane resistance is much higher than nf membranes owing to the dense polymeric structure of the former this directly impacts the performance of the evaluated membranes nf has a high initial flux and the final flux is about 70 greater than ro moreover nf presented a much lower flux decline table 5 fouling presented a greater contribution than the cp phenomenon to flux decline in both membranes analyzed the membrane fouling is related to deposition and or pore blocking by natural organic matter since the water salts concentration is low moreover the membrane fouling was much more evident in the ro system confirmed by the resistance in serie models results table 5 thus fouling formation seems to be directly related to membrane characteristics such as pore size hydrophobicity and surface charge the greater pore diameter associated with lesser surface roughness lower hydrophobicity and higher negative zeta potential of the nf membrane table 2 could subsequently lead to lower fouling potential compared to ro membrane table 5 the high surface roughness of a membrane could render this membrane more susceptible to fouling because foulant particles could accumulate in the valleys on the membrane surface due to higher local flux over valley regions 55 according to schäfer et al 56 a more negative membrane zeta potential could lead to a higher salt rejection due to an enhanced electrostatic interaction between the negatively charged membrane surface and charged solutes md presented constant permeate flux during the monitoring time and did not show any tendency or indication of critical fouling however it is about 60 and 37 smaller than nf and ro processes respectively it should be noted that the range of initial fluxes were the same as the one observed by han et al 29 17 kg m2h for the same temperature gradients tf tp 40 c md is known for a low propensity to fouling in comparison to other filtration processes that have pressure as the driving force 57 in the md process the additional foulant layer can also increase the heat transfer resistance 29 md performance with regard to both flux and water quality highlights this technology to be a viable process for surface water treatment the sec relates the permeate flux with the required energy this factor is directly associated with operational costs since nf membrane has a less salient hydraulic resistance it is possible to observe a smaller energy requirement sec 0 32 kw h m³ m² for ro the value found was 1 12 kw h m³ m² owing to the higher resistance imposed by the denser membrane regarding the md process two types of energy demands should be considered pump and heating requirements the former is the lowest 0 02 kw h m³ m² however the heating requirement is significantly higher 41 61 kw h m³ m² 3 3 rejection of phacs and toxicological risk reduction the capability of rejection of phacs by nf and ro membranes decreases as the permeate recovery rate rr increases table 6 the higher the rr the higher the compound accumulation in the feed solution which results in lower rejections because it induces greater passage of pollutants through the membrane 2 the first phac occurrence in the permeate happened at 40 and 60 permeate recovery rates for nf and ro respectively md showed a rejection 99 for both fluconazole and betamethasone for up to 70 rr betamethasone and fluconazole have similar molecular weights charges and molecular radiuses however they have a distinguishing hydrophobicity character considering that the molecular radiuses for both phacs are greater than the membrane pore radius the main rejection mechanism involved in both nf and ro appears to be size exclusion the loss of the phac rejection capacity of nf and ro membranes for higher permeate recovery rate values suggest that other mechanisms also affect phacs rejection since both phacs are neutral compounds under the experimental conditions the electrostatic repulsion mechanism did not contribute to their rejection according to bellona et al 58 the hydrophobic interaction between the phac and the membrane is an important rejection factor and the existing interactions between non ionic solutes and membranes may influence rejection of phacs since fluconazole are more hydrophilic than betamethasone logkow values are 0 40 and 1 94 respectively in water solutions fluconazole is solvated and consequently its effective diameter becomes larger 59 therefore they can be rejected more effectively by steric effects 60 fig 3 increasing the membrane efficiency as indicated in fig 3 the rejection of betamethasone and fluconazole declined throughout the test especially when assessing the nf performance the assessed compounds are accumulated on the membrane surface due to size exclusion and could eventually diffuse through the membrane polymer matrix towards the permeate side throughout the test 59 moreover the selected phacs exhibit the additional separation mechanism of adsorption when organic matter is mainly hydrophobic or has strong hydrogen bonding characteristics which makes it readily adsorbed on the fouled membranes surface 59 to analyze the effects of hydrogen bonding potential hfp on adsorption the hfp was defined as 61 22 h f p n d n a m w where nd and na were numbers of h bonding donors and acceptors respectively and mw was the molecular weight of the compound since the phac doses in this experiment were at trace levels the influence of h bonding sites on the membrane were not considered the two phacs were classified as a higher group with the hfp 0 02 61 which indicates that the solute of this group had greater adsorption extent adsorption can result from hydrophobic interactions and the formation of hydrogen bonds between the phacs and other materials in the sample matrix with the membrane materials 62 the ro membrane rejected the phacs at a much higher rate of up to 50 indicating that adsorption plays an important role in phacs rejection the effects of molecular hydrophobicity and hfp on phac rejection by the nf membrane were vague in comparison to ro this might be attributed to characteristics of the membrane bw30 is denser than the dk with a much smaller mwco and thus has a greater rejection not only for organic compounds but also for inorganic compounds including monovalent ions however upon long term filtration a membrane s adsorptive sites become exhausted and the adsorbed solutes eventually desorb to the permeate side of the membrane decreasing its efficiency as observed on fig 3 md process showed a rejection 99 for both fluconazole and betamethasone for a 70 rr these higher rejection results were expected since md rejection processes are mainly governed by volatility and to a lesser extent by hydrophobia both phacs presented kh values much lower than 10 3 mol m3 pa and therefore were classified as non volatile compounds since the md membrane only enables permeation of volatile compounds the phacs were concentrated in the feed solution similar results were also observed by wijekoon et al 28 high phacs removal by the md leads to a high toxicological risk reduction as betamethasone and fluconazole concentrations in the permeate obtained were below the mdl the water can be considered free of toxicological risk occurrence both for the environment and for human health the same is true for nf and ro processes at low permeate recovery rates even when these processes reach a 70 recovery rate the toxicological risks of the permeates obtained are negligible fig 4 shows the environmental and human health risk reduction by nf ro and md processes it is important to state that the concentrates of the three investigated processes are still in need of further treatment to degrade the phacs retained however the msp reduce the volume to be treated contributing to the reduction of costs and increase contaminants concentration facilitating their removal by chemical processes despite the higher concentration all three concentrates pose low acute environmental risk hq equal to 0 017 0 020 and 0 023 for nf ro and md respectively and do not pose chronic risk their moe are all above 1000 so they do not represent a risk for human health either although no environmental risk was observed in the concentrate this stream still needs treatment to permanently degrade organic compounds for this several advanced oxidation processes aops have been applied as post treatment stage to complement membrane filtration especially for the treatment of the retentate streams before discharging into environment 63 the higher phacs concentration in the concentrates stream provides an enabling condition for enhancing the efficiency of these processes since most aops are highly efficient at elevated pollutants concentration 63 3 4 membrane desalting ability in this study no significant difference in toc content was observed for the three msps with regard to electrical conductivity no statistical difference was observed in the md and ro permeates p value 0 05 table 7 however a slightly higher quality of md permeate was noted these results can be associated to the different permeation mechanisms the applied pressure contributes to a greater flow of solute on the membrane surface and therefore in a concentration polarization that in turn contributes to the greater transport of solute through the membrane however in the md process the temperature difference is the driving force and it is not sufficient to reach the volatile point of ions and organic matter therefore only water is expected to pass through the membrane these results agree with han et al 29 and meng et al 63 however the passage of organic matter through the membrane is possibly associated with its amphiphilicity the hydrophobic part interacts with the membrane matrix whereas the hydrophilic part can bond to the water molecules via hydrogen bonds to diffuse through the membrane 64 it is observed that all of the three processes were able to completely remove the color and turbidity agreeing with the brazilian legislation for drinking water table 1 as well as the standards recommended by the world health organization 65 table 6 according to the brazilian legislation for drinking water the water should contain at least 30 mg l of the calcium magnesium potassium and sodium salts however it should be noted from table 6 that all three processes permeate don t have minimum requirement of salts for distribution therefore it is possible to add the cited salts of food grade in the permeate to reach the minimum required concentration for drinking water distribution overall all the three assessed processes were able to meet all of the brazilian legal limits for drinking water when organic matter solids turbidity and color are concerned also it is important to highlight that the non addition of chemicals during the water treatment process reduces the possible risks associated to byproducts formation 3 5 preliminary cost evaluation the cost effectiveness of nf ro and md processes for treating surface water was studied with regard to supply to a medium sized city annual system capacity 500 m3 d 1 the permeate recovery rate for each process was selected considering the reduction of the phac concentration to values lower than the limit of detection being 30 50 and 70 for nf ro and md respectively table 8 shows the characteristics of the nf ro and md system considered for the calculation as well as the capex and opex for all systems the capex was strongly influenced by permeate recovery rate adopted being the nf the most expensive process the amortization cost adds considerable cost to the overall price of the drinking for nf and ro while for md energy cost corresponds to 85 of overall drinking water price fig 5 it is noteworthy that the preliminary economic study did not consider the concentrate disposal cost membrane and long term performance costs especially for membrane fouling and lifetime and permeate quality as indicated by the results of this study as well as previous studies md is much less susceptible to fouling than nf and ro in addition rejection of contaminants by md was much higher than those of nf or ro and it remained constant throughout the test however the cost associated to this process is still not feasible the operational cost found here is in the same as the one observed by hitsov et al 66 where values range between 2 1 5 4 m3 however the cost may be further reduced if low cost energy is used the operational cost could reach 0 30 m3 if residual heat is used 29 additionally several studies have successfully used solar energy to minimize the use of thermal energy and electricity 67 in this case when using solar energy it is expected to reduce in approximately 80 of the operational cost associated with heating energy moreover md membranes with better permeability need to be developed as well as a study to estimate the nf ro and md membrane lifetime 4 conclusions nf ro and md are efficient single step technologies for treatment of surface water to achieve drinking water quality and phac removal the rejection of phacs by nf and ro is mainly due to size exclusion and hydrophobic interactions whereas md rejection is mainly attributed to low volatility of phacs all evaluated processes lead to a high toxicological risk reduction in addition to presenting the highest phac removal md did not present fouling tendency which was the principal cause of flux decline in ro and nf the nf and ro membrane fouling occurred due to deposition and or pore blocking by natural organic matter since the water salts concentration is low opex were estimated at 0 50 0 43 and 1 96 us m3 for nf ro and md respectively although the md process is more robust the practical application is restricted by the high cost moreover the costs for md can be further reduced by utilizing low cost energy such as solar energy or residual heat future prospect for md membrane relies on membrane permeability improvement and nf and ro are feasible

14167,this study investigates the rejection of pharmaceutically active compounds phacs by nanofiltration nf reverse osmosis ro and membrane distillation md the doce river located in minas gerais brazil geographical coordinates 18 51 50 45 s and 41 56 46 86 w which is used for drinking water catching and raw sewage disposal was chosen as the background matrix for this study betamethasone and fluconazole among the 28 assessed phacs were the most recurrent during monitoring the results show that the phacs rejection by nf and ro membranes decreases as the permeate recovery rate rr increases the first phac occurrence in the permeate happened at 40 and 60 rr for nf and ro respectively md showed a rejection 99 for both fluconazole and betamethasone for up to 70 rr nf and ro reject phacs mainly through size exclusion and hydrophobic interactions whereas md rejects phacs due to their low volatility all evaluated processes lead to a toxicological risk reduction md did not show any tendency of fouling while nf and ro show flux decline mainly due to membrane fouling which was more evident in ro the membrane fouling occurred due to deposition and or pore blocking by natural organic matter since the water salts concentration is low opex was estimated at 0 50 0 43 and 1 96 us m3 for nf ro and md respectively although the md process is more robust the practical application is restricted by the high cost and nf and ro are feasible alternatives to remove phacs from drinking water keywords pharmaceutically active compounds nanofiltration reverse osmosis membrane distillation drinking water treatment 1 introduction more than 200 pharmaceutically active compounds phacs have been detected in varying concentrations ng l to μg l in surface ground water and sewage and have been recognized as potential environmental threats 1 3 phacs have been attracting global attention due to increase in their production usage continuous discharge to the environment as well as potential ecological effects 4 additionally their actual effects and interactions with the environment are still not well known and understood a large spectrum of pollutants from industrial and domestic effluents as well as farming activities arrive to conventional wastewater treatment plants wwtps these facilities are designed to remove organic matter and nutrients in the order of g l to mg l and thus the complete removal of phacs by a conventional wwtp is challenging due to several factors such as low volatility hydrophobicity complex structures and extremely low concentrations 5 consequently phacs are discharged into waterbodies as they are not completely eliminated during the treatment processes 6 previous studies have reported the adverse effects of phacs such as human wildlife reproduction disorders and the appearance of antibiotic resistant bacteria on non target organisms after their release into the environment 7 8 additionally it is known that releasing estrogenic pharmaceuticals into water bodies can interfere with sex differentiation thereby reducing or increasing fertility 9 the physicochemical properties of phacs favor their persistence in the environment propensity for bioaccumulation in living organisms and capability to be transformed into products after natural oxidative processes 10 therefore environmental risk assessment should be conducted in this regard moreover it has been reported that some phacs persist through treatment processes at drinking water treatment plants dwtps due to their small size and polarity which makes them highly water soluble mobile and extremely difficult to remove by conventional treatments 11 12 thus phacs are likely to be detrimental to humans as they can return to the human body through water cycle and food chain 13 therefore considering the possibility of inadvertent exposure to phacs via drinking water it is important to assess their consequent risks to human health considering the limitations associated with conventional treatment processes the need to achieve removal of phacs has led to alternative technologies such as membrane separation processes msps 4 14 19 msps such as membrane distillation md reverse osmosis ro and nanofiltration nf have been successfully applied either as a single process or as a combination of different membrane techniques at pilot and full scale installations in domestic or industrial wastewater reclamation to achieve a high quality permeate by efficiently removing a large spectrum of pollutants microorganisms salts organic micropollutants proteins sugars and inorganic ions nf and ro processes have demonstrated promising results for treatment of phacs and other emerging micropollutants 4 20 despite incomplete removal of ions nf presents a greater permeate flux and is able to work at lower pressures it is expected to show effective removal of organic pollutants 21 especially phacs since a majority of them have molecular weights within 150 500 da and the molecular weight cut off mwco for most commercial nf membranes ranges from about 100 to 2000 da 22 previous studies have indicated that steric hindrance effects by these membranes are the predominant phenomenon for rejection of phacs 23 the electrostatic effect is also significant in rejection of charged pharmaceutical compounds which explains the high rejection of negatively charged phacs by loose nf 24 and ro membranes exceeding 95 25 in addition almost all phacs can physically and or chemically interact with the membrane material leading to their adsorption onto the membrane and potentially impacting their rejection 11 md is a low temperature distillation process that operates by transporting water in vapor phase through a microporous and hydrophobic membrane to the distillate side theoretically this process shows 100 retention of non volatile components due to the temperature difference between the feed and distillate sides only the most volatile compounds typically water vaporize to pass through the pore openings at the feed membrane interface and subsequently condense at the distillate membrane interface direct contact membrane distillation is considered the most widely studied md system configuration due to its simple operation 26 md is less susceptible to membrane incrustation than pressure membrane processes since the latter are subject to hydraulic pressure moreover even when a fouling layer is formed on the membrane surface it is expected to be less compact and can be easily removed 27 wijekoon et al 28 studied the application of md for removing phacs during water and wastewater treatment the results suggested that the rejection and fate of phacs during md were governed by their volatility and hydrophobicity all phacs with pkh 9 were completely removed several studies 4 14 17 18 have evaluated and compared the application of nf and ro however only a few studies 27 29 have focused on the application of md in removing phacs from water and wastewater moreover most studies have been carried out using synthetic or spiked solutions therefore studies that focus on the application of msps to real water matrixes while dealing with real concentrations in the order of ng l to μg l and their complex matrices are still needed this allows for improvement of the treatment efficiency by reducing membrane fouling and energy requirements additionally it helps understand the rejection mechanisms and interactions between the membrane and the phacs to help establish the most effective operational systems to produce safe potable water therefore the aim of this study was to compare nf ro and md technologies in terms of their technical and economic performances with regard to the removal of phacs from a real water matrix 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area and sample collection the present study was conducted with water samples collected from doce river located at governador valadares in minas gerais brazil

controller and a maximum flow of 530 l h a needle type valve was used to adjust the feed flow rate and the trans membrane pressure tmp the pressure was measured by a manometer nf and ro were conducted in a stainless steel membrane cell with a diameter of 9 cm and filtration area of 63 6 cm2 the flat sheet commercial membranes were cut to fit the membrane cell and a feed spacer of 28 mils 25 4 μm

polytetrafloroethylene membrane sterlitech according to the manufacturer the average pore size and porosity of the md membrane were 0 22 μm and 70 respectively the membrane cell was made of acrylic glass and a flow channel was engraved in each of the two acrylic glass blocks that made up the feed and permeate the semi cells the feed solution was circulated from a glass reservoir to the membrane cell and then returned to the feed reservoir using the same procedure according to couto et al 36 fig 2 feed temperature was maintained by a hot plate the temperature of the distillate was regulated using a chiller aquacooler australia equipped with a stainless steel heat exchanging coil immersed directly in the distillate reservoir the distillate reservoir was placed directly on an analytical balance mettler toledo switzerland and the flux was calculated by mass increase observed over time at the end of each experiment the solution volume was measured again and the total volume loss was found to be less than 15 2 4 experimental procedure the following procedure was adopted for the nf and ro tests i de ionized water filtration under three different tmps 10 8 and 6 bar until a constant flux was obtained at each pressure ii water sample filtration under 10 bar at a concentrated flow rate of 3 2 l min 1 and a temperature of 25 c up to 70 recovery rate which took 12 and 18 h for nf and

concentrations of phacs in the distillate were corrected for dilution by accounting for the initial volume of milli q water in the distillate the duration of each md experiment was approximately 13 h

concentrations of metals k mg2 ca2 and na were quantified by atomic absorption spectrometry atomic absorption spectrophotometer gbc avanta 2 6 environmental and human health risk assessment the potential environmental risks of phacs were evaluated based on the hazard quotient hq values hq values were calculated for acute and chronic effects by dividing the measured environmental concentration with the predicted no effect concentration pnec which was determined by dividing the mean effect or lethal concentration ec50 or lc50 and the non observed effect concentration by safety factors whose typical values as reported in literature are 1000 and 10 respectively 37 for hq calculation the lowest pnec values were considered to obtain the worst case scenario the mixture toxicity was estimated by using the classical concentration addition model to calculate mixture hazard quotients mhq the risk was classified into the following categories high risk mhq 1 medium risk 0 1 mhq 1 low risk 0 01 mhq 0 1 and negligible risk mhq 0 01 38 to assess the impact on public health the margin of exposure was calculated by comparing the concentration of each phac in treated water samples to its concentration below which the probability of adverse effects as a result of long term lifetime exposure are negligible tolerable daily intake tdi which was derived from the non observed adverse effect level noael and a safety factor of 100 was used to estimate the safe exposure levels 37 tdi values for each phac were selected from literature or derived from noael 39 2 7 calculations the volumetric permeate fluxes l m 2 h 1 for nf j n f and ro j r o were calculated using eq 1 as follows 1 j n f j r o δ v p a m δ t where a m is the effective membrane area δ v p is the permeate volume collected and δ t is the collection time flux normalization at 25 c was accomplished by means of a correction factor related to the fluid viscosity according to eq 2 2 j 25 c δ v p a m δ t μ t μ 25 c where j 25 c is the normalized permeate flux at 25 c μ t is the water viscosity at the process temperature and μ 25 c is the water viscosity at 25 c the permeate recovery ratio r r n f and r r r o can be defined by eq 3 3 r r n f r r r o v p v f 100 where v p corresponds to the accumulated volume of permeate and v f to the initial volume of the feed for the md system the permeate flux j p m d was calculated according to eq 4 4 j p m d m d i m d f a m t i t f where m d i and m d f correspond to the mass kg of the initial and final distillate respectively a m is the area of the membrane m2 and t i and t f correspond to the initial and final times respectively the recovery rate r r m d is calculated by eq 5 5 r r m d m d f m d i m f i 100 where m f i corresponds to the mass kg of the initial feed the observed rejection was calculated using eq 6 as follows 6 r e j e c t i o n c f c p c f 100 where cf and cp represent the solute content in the feed and permeate streams respectively phacs losses during the md experiments were calculated by considering the mass balance of each analyzed compound in the feed concentrate and distillate as given in eq 7 7 c f x v f c d x v d c c x v c t o t a l l o s s where cf cd and cc are concentrations in the feed distillate and concentrate respectively similarly vf vd and vc are the feed distillate and concentrate volumes respectively according to the simplified resistance in series model the total filtration resistance could be divided into membrane resistance r m and fouling resistance r f r m was determined from eq 8 8 r m 1 k μ 25 c where k is the membrane water permeability for each test it was obtained from the ratio of normalized permeate flux of pure water j w and applied pressures δp at 10 0 8 0 and 6 0 bar linearization r f was calculated based on the normalized effluent permeate flux j s d obtained near the end of each experiment eq 9 this resistance includes concentration polarization cp components adsorption on the membrane surface and scaling 9 r f δ p δ π μ 25 c j s d r m where δ p δ π is the process effective pressure i e applied pressure minus osmotic pressure the osmotic pressure difference was calculated using van t hoff equation eq 10 10 δ π i 0 n c c c p r t where r is the universal gas constant t is the permeation temperature in kelvin and the sum of the difference of the molar concentration of the main dissolved species that are present in the concentrate c c and permeate c p at each recuperation rate rr rf is a combination of reversible fouling rfr and irreversible fouling layer rfir 40 rfr results mostly due to deposition of a cake layer on the membrane surface which can be removed through physical cleaning such as water washing thus it can be controlled by adjusting the feed flow conditions rfir occurs due to adsorption onto membrane surface and into its pores and can be removed by chemical cleaning for the md resistance calculations i e membrane resistance r m feed boundary layer resistance r f b and permeate boundary layer resistance r p b 36 41 pressures and temperatures at the membrane surface were calculated according to couto et al 36 the total flux decline fd for all three processes was calculated as follows 11 f d j w j s d j w flux decline can be attributed to cp and fouling f thus the flux decline due to cp was obtained using eq 12 12 c p j p c j s d j w where jpc is the volumetric water flux of the physically cleaned membrane after effluent filtration the flux decline due to fouling was obtained using eq 13 13 f j w j p c j w the specific energy consumption sec for nf and ro was calculated from eq 14 and 15 42 14 s e c w p u m p q p 15 w p u m p δ p q f where w p u m p is the pump work rate kwh s δ is the difference between the feed pressure at the entrance of the membrane and the pressure of raw water which is assumed to be equal to the atmospheric pressure n m² and and are the feed and permeate flow rates m³ s respectively the permeate product water recovery for nf processes y can be defined using eq 16 as follows 16 y q p q f by combining eqs 14 15 and 16 the sec equation can be rewritten as follows 17 s e c δ p y energy consumptions for the md system are estimated both for heat cooling energy and for circulation of the streams the specific thermal energy consumption or stec kwh m3 was calculated according to qtaishat

the md system experimental data 2 8 statistical evaluation due to the small quantity of data i e seven data points per test a non parametric statistical test was used kruskal wallis test was used to check for significant differences between the evaluated parameters and subsequently non parametric multiple comparisons were investigated among the groups α 5 statistica 8 0 software was used for all statistical analyses 2 9 preliminary investment and cost estimate a preliminary economic evaluation was conducted to estimate the capital and operational expenses capex and opex to treat doce river water by nf ro and md the variables considered were costs of membrane unit membrane replacement chemical cleaning agents energy consumption and system maintenance for nf and ro the membrane unit capital cost was based on a price provided by a major supplier of commercial membranes in brazil 8750 00 usd m3 h of effluent for md the membrane unit capital cost was considered to be 7680 00 u m3 h 44 it assumed one filtration stage and volumetric flows equal to the designed systems capacity q d e s of 0 04 m3 s to estimate the capital cost per cubic meter of effluent the capital cost was annualized by means of the amortization factor as presented in eq 20 45 20 a p i c 1 i c d l 1 i c d l 1 where a p is the amortization factor i c is the investment rate 14 in 2018 for brazil and dl is the design life of the plant the membrane systems design life was considered to be 15 years the capital cost per cubic meter was obtained from eq 21 21 c c a p m 3 c c a p a p q d e s where c c a p m 3 is the capital cost per cubic meter of effluent and c c a p is the system capital cost membrane replacement costs considered an average membrane lifespan of 5 years the permeate recovery rate was set at a value greater than one that provided phac concentrations below the method quantification limit mql for each assessed treatment nf ro and md membrane costs were provided by a large commercial membrane supplier as 50 40 and 60 us m² respectively the energy cost estimate comprised the assessed systems feed pump requirement and the thermal energy for heating the md feed solution a once through operation process was considered and the power requirement was estimated from eq 20 to 25 the energy tariff paid by the water production company in brazil is 0 04 us kwh at an exchange rate of r 1 us 0 25 the costs of chemicals for membrane cleaning and maintenance costs were estimated at 2 and 5 per year of the initial investment cost respectively 46 3 results and discussion 3 1 occurrence of phacs in doce river betamethasone anti inflammatory and fluconazole antifungal among the 28 assessed phacs evaluated were quantified in the water sample collected for this specific study table 3 november marks the beginning of the rainy season in brazil which propitiates increased fungal populations and may explain the higher fluconazole concentration table 4 shows the physical chemical properties and toxicity indicators of betamethasone and fluconazole in the water sample fluconazole concentrations were found to be significantly higher than the ones found in rivers in spain 28 5 ng l china 22 8 ng l and korea 46 2 ng l 49 51 betamethasone concentration was also higher than those found in the us and germany 52 53 according to vestel et al 53 the pharmaceutical assessment and transport evaluation model estimated betamethasone concentrations to be 0 6 ng l in 95 of all u s surface waters and in germany the concentrations were found to be between 0 07 and 2 8 ng l 54 the highest concentration observed in the doce river may be related to untreated sewage discharge the city governador valadares does not count with wastewater treatment coverage thus the sewage is released in natura in the river regardless both fluconazole and betamethasone pose negligible environmental risks hq 0 01 considering the mixture doce river water poses low toxicological risk as the mhq found owing to these two phacs was 0 011 for acute toxicity and 0 002 for chronic toxicity regarding human health risk the moe obtained was 2125 indicating low probability of risk therefore a specific screening of these two compounds in the membrane permeate was performed in order to assess the ability of nf ro and md to remove these phacs 3 2 membrane performance fouling propensity as expected ro membrane resistance is much higher than nf membranes owing to the dense polymeric structure of the former this directly impacts the performance of the evaluated membranes nf has a high initial flux and the final flux is about 70 greater than ro moreover nf presented a much lower flux decline table 5 fouling presented a greater contribution than the cp phenomenon to flux decline in both membranes analyzed the membrane fouling is related to deposition and or pore blocking by natural organic matter since the water salts concentration is low moreover the membrane fouling was much more evident in the ro system confirmed by the resistance in serie models results table 5 thus fouling formation seems to be directly related to membrane characteristics such as pore size hydrophobicity and surface charge the greater pore diameter associated with lesser surface roughness lower hydrophobicity and higher negative zeta potential of the nf membrane table 2 could subsequently lead to lower fouling potential compared to ro membrane table 5 the high surface roughness of a membrane could render this membrane more susceptible to fouling because foulant particles could accumulate in the valleys on the membrane surface due to higher local flux over valley regions 55 according to schäfer et al 56 a more negative membrane zeta potential could lead to a higher salt rejection due to an enhanced electrostatic interaction between the negatively charged membrane surface and charged solutes md presented constant permeate flux during the monitoring time and did not show any tendency or indication of critical fouling however it is about 60 and 37 smaller than nf and ro processes respectively it should be noted that the range of initial fluxes were the same as the one observed by han et al 29 17 kg m2h for the same temperature gradients tf tp 40 c md is known for a low propensity to fouling in comparison to other filtration processes that have pressure as the driving force 57 in the md process the additional foulant layer can also increase the heat transfer resistance 29 md performance with regard to both flux and water quality highlights this technology to be a viable process for surface water treatment the sec relates the permeate flux with the required energy this factor is directly associated with operational costs since nf membrane has a less salient hydraulic resistance it is possible to observe a smaller energy requirement sec 0 32 kw h m³ m² for ro the value found was 1 12 kw h m³ m² owing to the higher resistance imposed by the denser membrane regarding the md process two types of energy demands should be considered pump and heating requirements the former is the lowest 0 02 kw h m³ m² however the heating requirement is significantly higher 41 61 kw h m³ m² 3 3 rejection of phacs and toxicological risk reduction the capability of rejection of phacs by nf and ro membranes decreases as the permeate recovery rate rr increases table 6 the higher the rr the higher the compound accumulation in the feed solution which results in lower rejections because it induces greater passage of pollutants through the membrane 2 the first phac occurrence in the permeate happened at 40 and 60 permeate recovery rates for nf and ro respectively md showed a rejection 99 for both fluconazole and betamethasone for up to 70 rr betamethasone and fluconazole have similar molecular weights charges and molecular radiuses however they have a distinguishing hydrophobicity character considering that the molecular radiuses for both phacs are greater than the membrane pore radius the main rejection mechanism involved in both nf and ro appears to be size exclusion the loss of the phac rejection capacity of nf and ro membranes for higher permeate recovery rate values suggest that other mechanisms also affect phacs rejection since both phacs are neutral compounds under the experimental conditions the electrostatic repulsion mechanism did not contribute to their rejection according to bellona et al 58 the hydrophobic interaction between the phac and the membrane is an important rejection factor and the existing interactions between non ionic solutes and membranes may influence rejection of phacs since fluconazole are more hydrophilic than betamethasone logkow values are 0 40 and 1 94 respectively in water solutions fluconazole is solvated and consequently its effective diameter becomes larger 59 therefore they can be rejected more effectively by steric effects 60 fig 3 increasing the membrane efficiency as indicated in fig 3 the rejection of betamethasone and fluconazole declined throughout the test especially when assessing the nf performance the assessed compounds are accumulated on the membrane surface due to size exclusion and could eventually diffuse through the membrane polymer matrix towards the permeate side throughout the test 59 moreover the selected phacs exhibit the additional separation mechanism of adsorption when organic matter is mainly hydrophobic or has strong hydrogen bonding characteristics which makes it readily adsorbed on the fouled membranes surface 59 to analyze the effects of hydrogen bonding potential hfp on adsorption the hfp was defined as 61 22 h f p n d n a m w where nd and na were numbers of h bonding donors and acceptors respectively and mw was the molecular weight of the compound since the phac doses in this experiment were at trace levels the influence of h bonding sites on the membrane were not considered the two phacs were classified as a higher group with the hfp 0 02 61 which indicates that the solute of this group had greater adsorption extent adsorption can result from hydrophobic interactions and the formation of hydrogen bonds between the phacs and other materials in the sample matrix with the membrane materials 62 the ro membrane rejected the phacs at a much higher rate of up to 50 indicating that adsorption plays an important role in phacs rejection the effects of molecular hydrophobicity and hfp on phac rejection by the nf membrane were vague in comparison to ro this might be attributed to characteristics of the membrane bw30 is denser than the dk with a much smaller mwco and thus has a greater rejection not only for organic compounds but also for inorganic compounds including monovalent ions however upon long term filtration a membrane s adsorptive sites become exhausted and the adsorbed solutes eventually desorb to the permeate side of the membrane decreasing its efficiency as observed on fig 3 md process showed a rejection 99 for both fluconazole and betamethasone for a 70 rr these higher rejection results were expected since md rejection processes are mainly governed by volatility and to a lesser extent by hydrophobia both phacs presented kh values much lower than 10 3 mol m3 pa and therefore were classified as non volatile compounds since the md membrane only enables permeation of volatile compounds the phacs were concentrated in the feed solution similar results were also observed by wijekoon et al 28 high phacs removal by the md leads to a high toxicological risk reduction as betamethasone and fluconazole concentrations in the permeate obtained were below the mdl the water can be considered free of toxicological risk occurrence both for the environment and for human health the same is true for nf and ro processes at low permeate recovery rates even when these processes reach a 70 recovery rate the toxicological risks of the permeates obtained are negligible fig 4 shows the environmental and human health risk reduction by nf ro and md processes it is important to state that the concentrates of the three investigated processes are still in need of further treatment to degrade the phacs retained however the msp reduce the volume to be treated contributing to the reduction of costs and increase contaminants concentration facilitating their removal by chemical processes despite the higher concentration all three concentrates pose low acute environmental risk hq equal to 0 017 0 020 and 0 023 for nf ro and md respectively and do not pose chronic risk their moe are all above 1000 so they do not represent a risk for human health either although no environmental risk was observed in the concentrate this stream still needs treatment to permanently degrade organic compounds for this several advanced oxidation processes aops have been applied as post treatment stage to complement membrane filtration especially for the treatment of the retentate streams before discharging into environment 63 the higher phacs concentration in the concentrates stream provides an enabling condition for enhancing the efficiency of these processes since most aops are highly efficient at elevated pollutants concentration 63 3 4 membrane desalting ability in this study no significant difference in toc content was observed for the three msps with regard to electrical conductivity no statistical difference was observed in the md and ro permeates p value 0 05 table 7 however a slightly higher quality of md permeate was noted these results can be associated to the different permeation mechanisms the applied pressure contributes to a greater flow of solute on the membrane surface and therefore in a concentration polarization that in turn contributes to the greater transport of solute through the membrane however in the md process the temperature difference is the driving force and it is not sufficient to reach the volatile point of ions and organic matter therefore only water is expected to pass through the membrane these results agree with han et al 29 and meng et al 63 however the passage of organic matter through the membrane is possibly associated with its amphiphilicity the hydrophobic part interacts with the membrane matrix whereas the hydrophilic part can bond to the water molecules via hydrogen bonds to diffuse through the membrane 64 it is observed that all of the three processes were able to completely remove the color and turbidity agreeing with the brazilian legislation for drinking water table 1 as well as the standards recommended by the world health organization 65 table 6 according to the brazilian legislation for drinking water the water should contain at least 30 mg l of the calcium magnesium potassium and sodium salts however it should be noted from table 6 that all three processes permeate don t have minimum requirement of salts for distribution therefore it is possible to add the cited salts of food grade in the permeate to reach the minimum required concentration for drinking water distribution overall all the three assessed processes were able to meet all of the brazilian legal limits for drinking water when organic matter solids turbidity and color are concerned also it is important to highlight that the non addition of chemicals during the water treatment process reduces the possible risks associated to byproducts formation 3 5 preliminary cost evaluation the cost effectiveness of nf ro and md processes for treating surface water was studied with regard to supply to a medium sized city annual system capacity 500 m3 d 1 the permeate recovery rate for each process was selected considering the reduction of the phac concentration to values lower than the limit of detection being 30 50 and 70 for nf ro and md respectively table 8 shows the characteristics of the nf ro and md system considered for the calculation as well as the capex and opex for all systems the capex was strongly influenced by permeate recovery rate adopted being the nf the most expensive process the amortization cost adds considerable cost to the overall price of the drinking for nf and ro while for md energy cost corresponds to 85 of overall drinking water price fig 5 it is noteworthy that the preliminary economic study did not consider the concentrate disposal cost membrane and long term performance costs especially for membrane fouling and lifetime and permeate quality as indicated by the results of this study as well as previous studies md is much less susceptible to fouling than nf and ro in addition rejection of contaminants by md was much higher than those of nf or ro and it remained constant throughout the test however the cost associated to this process is still not feasible the operational cost found here is in the same as the one observed by hitsov et al 66 where values range between 2 1 5 4 m3 however the cost may be further reduced if low cost energy is used the operational cost could reach 0 30 m3 if residual heat is used 29 additionally several studies have successfully used solar energy to minimize the use of thermal energy and electricity 67 in this case when using solar energy it is expected to reduce in approximately 80 of the operational cost associated with heating energy moreover md membranes with better permeability need to be developed as well as a study to estimate the nf ro and md membrane lifetime 4 conclusions nf ro and md are efficient single step technologies for treatment of surface water to achieve drinking water quality and phac removal the rejection of phacs by nf and ro is mainly due to size exclusion and hydrophobic interactions whereas md rejection is mainly attributed to low volatility of phacs all evaluated processes lead to a high toxicological risk reduction in addition to presenting the highest phac removal md did not present fouling tendency which was the principal cause of flux decline in ro and nf the nf and ro membrane fouling occurred due to deposition and or pore blocking by natural organic matter since the water salts concentration is low opex were estimated at 0 50 0 43 and 1 96 us m3 for nf ro and md respectively although the md process is more robust the practical application is restricted by the high cost moreover the costs for md can be further reduced by utilizing low cost energy such as solar energy or residual heat future prospect for md membrane relies on membrane permeability improvement and nf and ro are feasible

14168,the benefits of wastewater ww reclamation to alleviate the stress of freshwater resources are counterbalanced by the required energy demand to drive the treatments this handicap can be considerably minimized when renewable energy sources are integrated to perform this process increasing the environmental and energy sustainability of the reclamation process this work reports the assessment of a new strategy for ww reclamation in shoreline wastewater treatment plants wwtps through the conversion of the salinity gradient energy sge generated in the contact between reclaimed water rw and seawater sw to electricity by the use of reverse electrodialysis red secondary effluents from the selected wwtp were further treated by a simple remediation process consisting of coagulation flocculation and solids removal ending with a filtration stage the obtained rw contained 0 008 m nacl and was used as low concentrated solution in the red stack besides filtered sw with 0 5 m nacl was employed as high concentrated solution the plant run for 480 h reaching gross power up to 1 43 w m2 without decay along the operation time indicating that no fouling issues appeared in this time period this represents a great improvement in comparison to the results published in the literature so far the slight increase in the salinity of rw still allowed for its further reuse thus a novel and energy sustainable strategy to promote ww reclamation with simultaneous sge recovery is presented keywords wastewater reclamation energy sustainability salinity gradient power reverse electrodialysis 1 introduction water demands are continuously increasing to supply agriculture industry and cities due to economic and population growth while water availability is becoming heavily committed in many areas of the world nowadays estimates suggest that about 33 of population live in water stressed countries and this figure could be increased to 66 by 2025 1 in addition the growing industrialization process leads to a rise in water demands which is a challenge specially in water scarce regions 2 the use of reclaimed water rw can greatly contribute to the alleviation of the stress imposed on freshwater resources in areas of scarcity promoting sustainability this type of water can be employed towards multiple non potable purposes such as agricultural irrigation industrial use urban greening surface water recharge and even for domestic uses 3 water demands are continuously increasing to supply agriculture industry and cities due to economic and population growth while water availability is becoming heavily committed in many areas of the world the use of rw can greatly contribute to the alleviation of the stress imposed on freshwater resources this type of water can be employed for irrigation industrial processing and even for domestic uses thus recent works focus on transforming ww into rw is an environmental challenge since it promotes ecological protection by reducing the impact of discharges and allows water reuse 4 5 2 under this perspective urban ww constitutes a valuable resource that if sustainably managed can be regarded as a central pillar of the circular economy 6 7 in fact europe policies and directives are becoming stricter on the standards for ww discharges encouraging water reuse 8 11 in contrast running wwtps imply high energy consumption which is mainly supplied through fossil fuels thus contributing negatively to climate change depending on the plant scale units and treatment intensity the typical energy consumption per m3 falls in the range 0 25 0 60 kw h m3 causing the release of 0 276 kgco2 eq kwh 12 13 water reclamation would require additional energy consumption which restricts its applicability in many cases despite being technically feasible thus new strategies such as the promotion of self sufficiency in wwtps through the use of emerging renewable energy technologies are necessary to perform this process in a sustainable way 14 salinity gradient energy sge is created from the difference in salinity of two streams and represents a highly promising option as source of renewable energy considering the discharge of rivers into the sea it would be possible to generate up to 2 tw of salinity gradient power while the discharge of treated ww effluents into the sea could provide another 18 gw 15 to this date there are two available technologies to extract sge pressure retarded osmosis pro 16 17 and reverse electrodialysis red is the most efficient technology to harness this type of energy with no associated thermal or environmental pollution and without causing greenhouse gas emissions this technology employs stacks formed of alternate ion exchange membranes cationic and anionic separated by spacers to create compartments through which the solutions are fed 18 the operation cost of sge is estimated to be less than 0 08 kwh excluding any subsidy or compensation comparable to that of wind energy 19 with the additional advantage that sge can be generated continuously 24 h per day and 365 days a year unlike wind or solar energy 20 wwtps have the challenge to boost reclamation of treated ww at the same time that fossil fuels based energy consumption is reduced in this sense wwtps located in coastal areas where sw can be used as high concentration stream to feed red units are ideal frameworks for harvesting sge red technology will be fed by sw on one inlet and by the treated secondary effluent rw on the second one power recovery from these streams can account for 0 63 w m2 per membrane pair installed 21 in addition the flowrate of the high concentration stream can be adapted to the available flowrate of wwtp discharges in order to ensure its optimum exploitation currently the bottle neck for water reclamation processes is the tradeoff between the adequate treatment to make possible the reuse of water and the minimization of energy consumption in sge red systems the main problem associated with the use of biologically treated ww lies on the presence of divalent ions such as magnesium mg2 calcium ca2 and sulphate so4 2 and particulate matter which can affect membrane resistance or cause membrane fouling at medium and long term operation thus lowering power performance 22 29 however working with rw would avoid these issues feeding the red stack for internal energy recovery before end use applications this work aims to demonstrate the viability of water reclamation at the same time that energy is recovered by sge red technology avoiding the typical fouling issues arising from its operation a coastal plant was selected to facilitate the use of sw as high concentrated solution whereas treated secondary effluents rw were employed as low concentrated solution a simple reclamation treatment consisting of coagulation flocculation and decantation stages followed by filtration to remove solids was applied to treat secondary ww this stream was then continuously used for power generation over 480 h in a red stack the reclamation treatment applied to the secondary effluent and the slight increase in salinity after the energy recovery step contributed to produce water with high enough quality for further reuse 30 thus we underline the benefits of coupling the concepts and practice of ww reclamation and sge harvesting to offer more sustainable strategies for water reclamation and reuse in coastal wwtps 2 materials and methods 2 1 treatment for secondary ww effluent a secondary biologically treated wwtp effluent was subjected to a relatively simple treatment to increase water quality and allow further reuse as reclaimed water rw and at the same time to meet the standards to feed the red sge stack this effluent was first characterized by an initial silt density index sdi of 76 28 this index is a measure for the fouling capacity of water and was determined according to the astm d4189 95 2002 standard 29 in addition the initial turbidity of the wwtp effluent was as high as 6 72 ntus which exceeds the standard limits for reclaimed water a trade off between the intensity of the treatments applied to the secondary effluent and the water quality standards for further use needs to be found this fact is motivated by the energy costs associated with treatment operations since a depth filtration implies high energy consumption a coagulation flocculation process was employed in order to reduce the following critical parameters sdi turbidity total suspended solids tss and chemical oxygen demand cod which are indicators of water quality with restricted limits depending on water standards coagulation is commonly used prior to sedimentation in order to remove particles specifically the process of coagulation neutralises charge and forms large flocs coming from finely divided particles from its part in flocculation processes the colloids come out of the suspension due to the addition of a clarifying agent the secondary effluent was first coagulated using aluminium sulphate acideka spain at 265 0 mg l and then flocculated with polyacrylamide a e vallés spain at 2 0 mg l followed by settling for 24 h subsequently filtration was performed using cartridge filters of up to 10 μm fig 1 summarises the treatment applied to the secondary ww stream for its part seawater sw was treated with filters of 1 μm to remove all the particulate matter from this stream afterwards ultraviolet disinfection was applied fig 2 shows the scheme of the treatment as it will be discussed in the following section the treatments applied to rw and sw effluents were suitable to avoid the fouling issues that different authors have previously reported when working with natural and waste streams to feed red stacks 26 27 31 33 2 2 sge red experiments the sge experiments were performed using a red stack comprising 20 cell pairs formed by anion and cation exchange membranes aems and cems respectively with commercial names fks 50 and fas 50 respectively and supplied by fumatech each membrane had 36 cm2 of area 50 μm of thickness and membranes were arranged alternately between commercial polyethersulfone spacers with a porosity of 82 5 fumatech germany aems and cems membranes were characterized by the permselectivity ranges of 0 92 0 96 and 0 97 0 99 for kcl concentrations between 0 1 and 0 5 m respectively at the ends of the stack an electrode rinse solution ers composed of 0 05 m k3fe cn 6 0 05 m k4fe cn 6 scharlau purity 99 0 and 0 25 m nacl fisher chemicals assay 99 5 was continuously recirculated through the anodic and cathodic compartments to maintain electroneutrality by means of redox reactions rw coming from the process depicted in fig 1 was used as lc solution while sw coming from the cantabrian sea spain was used as hc solution after the treatment described in fig 2 the flowrates of rw and sw streams were 130 ml min equivalent to a linear velocity of 1 19 cm s these flowrates were selected to comply with the constraints of linear velocity of the stack 1 0 2 0 cm s an electronic load was used to perform the experiments chroma systems solutions 63103a usa as previously reported in other works 18 21 34 red performance is greatly influenced by temperature to avoid the influence of this parameter during operation the temperatures of the water streams were monitored and maintained constant at 24 1 c in addition the stack was isolated for temperature control using a conventional oven at the same temperature a schematic diagram of the experimental plant is shown in fig 3 a comprehensive mathematical model reported in a previous work 18 and developed in the software aspen custom model v9 aspentech was employed to predict the electrical performance of the red stack under the above mentioned conditions the response of the system in terms of open circuit voltage ocv and power output were selected to study the stability of the system over time and to detect any possible decay in performance due to the presence of membrane fouling 3 results and discussion in this section the quality of the reclaimed water obtained with the proposed tertiary treatment is presented and discussed in addition the viability of the use of rw and lc as feed streams in sge red technology is analysed finally the results obtained with red operation working with real water streams over 480 h using sw and rw as hc and lc streams respectively are presented the values achieved with the red stack are compared with results already reported in the literature 3 1 characterization of reclaimed water obtained from wwtp effluents the use of rw for urban industrial or agricultural activities is becoming a goal worldwide due to the increasing water scarcity 10 nevertheless in order to use ww effluents after treatment as rw it is necessary to comply with the existing regulations specifically eu directives as well as more restrictive policies on rw use in some european countries such as spain set the maximum values for turbidity total suspended solids tss and chemical oxygen demand cod 8 11 35 according to the data shown in table 1 the applied tertiary treatment described in fig 1 comprising the stages of coagulation flocculation decantation and filtration demonstrated to be adequate to obtain reclaimed water for different uses turbidity showed an important reduction from 6 72 before treatment to 0 4 ntu after the treatment turbidity reduction higher than 94 in the case of tss and cod the values after treatment were 7 9 mg l and 25 mg l respectively moreover the conductivity with a value of 1 8 ms cm that increased after rw use in the sge red plant also met the requirements for rw maximum limit of 3 0 ms cm the obtained reclaimed waters fulfil the allowable concentration in the target parameters such as turbidity tss or conductivity for reuse in urban activities like garden park and street irrigation fire systems or industrial applications like process or cleaning water in industrial sectors other than the food industry 6 34 9 finally total organic carbon toc a non specific indicator of water quality that measures the amount of carbon found in an organic compound was reduced over 60 thus the treatment applied was suitable to reach the required quality of rw for multiple uses as mentioned before moreover this treatment demonstrates the possibility of obtaining reclaimed water using sge red technology without penalty cost associated to energy consumption after a simple tertiary treatment moreover the treatment applied to the secondary ww effluent to obtain rw was effective at greatly reducing both sdi and toc a decrease in sdi from an initial value of 76 28 down to 13 90 was achieved implying a significant reduction of over 81 in this parameter in the case of sw after treatment a reduction of 80 was obtained in turbidity as well as tss from initial values of 4 ntus and 28 mg l respectively it was important to reduce these parameters in order to avoid the fouling issues when using sw as feeding stream in red stacks after treatment the concentrations of the main ions present in both streams were also measured as displayed in table 2 as observed the concentrations of sodium na in the hc and lc streams were 0 5 m and 0 008 m respectively which correspond to the typical average values of the salt concentration in the atlantic ocean sea and of the wwtp effluents the divalent ion specie with highest concentration in the seawater was found to be magnesium while in the case of the rw magnesium and calcium were within the same ratio because the area in which the wwtp is located is characterized by a high presence of calcite nevertheless the concentration of divalent ions in rw is lower than 20 with respect to na 3 2 experimental determination of energy potential subtracted from the salinity gradient in a red system using rw and sw in order to determine the potential energy that could be subtracted from the salinity gradient from the mixing of these two streams through red technology an assessment of model water streams composed by extra pure nacl mgcl2 cacl2 and na2so4 in distilled water taking into account the concentrations of sw and rw included in table 2 first an experiment using only nacl was performed sw 0 5 m rw 0 008 m and later the rest of salts were added fig 4 shows the gross power obtained as function of current density with both parameters normalized to effective cell pair membrane area the values accomplished when pure nacl was used are slightly higher 1 6 w m2 in comparison to the scenario in which the different divalent ions were added 1 42 w m2 these values are similar or higher than previous data reported in the literature 21 the presence of mgcl2 and cacl2 led to a drop in power output of only 10 while the addition of na2so4 did not further affect power performance these results demonstrate the possibility of using sge red in reclaimed water processes in order to favour the reduction in fossil fuel consumption once satisfactory results working with model waters were achieved the treated real water effluents sw and rw were employed as feeding streams for a red stack to confirm the viability of using a sge process the evolution of power output and ocv was monitored over time to study the stability of the red performance as representative case fig 5 shows the experimental and simulated power curves after 48 h of operation and at a fixed temperature of 24 c the simulated power curve was calculated with a mathematical model implemented in aspen custom modeler and validated in a previous work 18 the fitting between experimental and simulated curves with a difference of 14 for the points of maximum power output supports the validity of the model in predicting the red plant performance the maximum power output is normalized to the active pair membrane area 36 cm2 and the calculated power density 1 43 w m2 is among the highest values reported for natural and ww streams due to the use of rw 21 the values achieved were virtually the same as those obtained when model waters were employed fig 4 these results demonstrate that real water streams can be effectively employed in red processes being necessary to take into account the presence of mgcl2 and cacl2 in order to quantify the decrease in power performance probably due to an increase in membrane resistance 36 37 3 3 evaluation of medium term behaviour of red system using real water the appearance of fouling phenomena on anion and cation exchange membranes in red systems has been identified as a bottle neck by previous authors when real scenarios were used 25 27 29 33 38 in this sense the performance of the tertiary treatment fig 1 and a treatment for sw fig 2 for fouling prevention in the red stack is evaluated in this section through the evolution of a sge red process fed with rw and sw treated over the 20 days 480 h fig 6 shows the power obtained along this period normalized to the value obtained at 48 h 100 since this is the time at which the system reaches the stationary state as it can be observed in fig 6 the response of the system in terms of gross power remains virtually constant for the whole horizon time with no power performance decay observed in fact power performance is always within a 10 deviation with regard to the value adopted as reference for the 480 h the system was operated continuously with sw and rw and therefore these results indicate that the reclamation treatment described in section 2 2 was effective in avoiding the appearance of membrane fouling that otherwise would significantly affect power output ensuring the smooth running of the stack over time this finding represents a great progress on this technology since previous works have reported major fouling issues for the short and medium term 25 27 as it will be discussed later ocv response was also monitored to study the stability of the red system performance for the whole time horizon analyzed fig 7 shows the measured ocv normalized to the value of ocv reached at 48 h which corresponds to 3 45 v as in the case of power performance the ocv response of the red system remains almost constant over 480 h with no more than 10 deviation with respect to the reference value at all times dashed line again confirming the effectiveness of the applied treatment to maintain the high performance of the red stack after the operation time 480 h the stack was opened and examined visually to confirm that fouling was avoided using the simple treatment previously described fig 8 includes representative photographs of the membranes before and after operation specifically the surface of cation and anion exchange membranes in contact with rw streams are shown according to the images membranes offered mostly clean surfaces at the end of the experiment without observing fouling issues or deposits of blocking materials the mark visible in fig 8b corresponds to the pressure exerted by the spacers to assembly the membrane these results were also found for the membrane surfaces in contact with the sw compartments confirming that the membranes remained in good condition after 480 h of operation the results obtained are very promising since the decay in red performance related to the appearance of membrane fouling when using natural and ww streams has been frequently reported in the literature for shorter operation times than in this work vermaas et al 26 employed sw 0 5 m nacl and river water 0 017 m nacl as hc and lc solutions respectively the water streams were subjected to pre filtration through several microfilters with the final filter having a sieve size of 20 μm they observed a significant decrease in red performance after the first day more than 40 in terms of normalized power relative to theory in different stack configuration including stacks equipped with spacers and with profiled membranes di salvo et al 27 employed two types of ww to feed red stacks fish processing wastewater as hc solution 0 5 m nacl and reclaimed water from an urban wwtp as lc solution concentrations between 0 004 and 0 010 m nacl the fist type of water was treated in a pilot aerobic granular sequence batch air lift reactor system followed by further filtration 5 μm while wwtp effluent was treated in an experimental membrane bioreactor fouling issues were detected after 4 days of operation observing a decrease in ocv another representative work is that of moreno et al 29 who employed real seawater 0 3 m na and river water 0 003 m na which were passed through drum filters with an average diameter of 20 μm red performance remained well below the scenario in which specific strategies to prevent fouling accumulation during real operation time were applied e g injection of streams saturated with co2 in other work moreno et al 28 studied different types of membranes as well as different quantities of mgcl2 in order to analyse the effect of this compound as substitute of nacl in red performance results showed that mgcl2 do not affect the stability of the system however a decreased in gross power with respect to the use of pure nacl was observed due to the lower ion mobility of magnesium ions inside the membranes table 3 summarizes the gross power values reported by these authors when medium and long term experiments were carried out 26 29 in contrast to the results reported in the literature the treatment applied in this work to both types of water was effective for the medium run of the system specifically the use of red units in wwtps placed on coastal locations offers a great opportunity since sw can be employed as high concentrated solution on the other hand the use of rw as feeding solution opens room for a significant exploitation potential thus the results obtained in this manuscript offer a step forward for producing rw with zero energy consumption due to the use of red technology nevertheless new experiments increasing the temporal horizon may be need to be approached in future research works 4 conclusions a novel strategy for water reclamation with simultaneous energy generation from the mixing of rw and sw streams through red technology has been proposed after harvesting sge the quality of rw achieved met the standards required for multiple uses in agreement with the policies developed by the european commission for water reuse the appearance of fouling issues on the anion and cation exchange membranes over a significant time horizon of 480 h was prevented for such a period the operation provided a stable power performance and constant ocv output the power outcome was validated with a previously developed mathematical model showing that the maximum power output achieved and maintained over time was very close to the value predicted by the mathematical model 1 43 w m2 this strategy would promote wastewater reclamation because the rw with slight increase in salinity in comparison to the wwtp effluent could be further applied in secondary uses after internal energy recovery finally it is worth noting that red technology could be directly used in wwtps equipped tertiary units in order to reduce fossil fuels based energy consumption declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing

separated by spacers to create compartments through which the solutions are fed 18 the operation cost of sge is estimated to be less than 0 08 kwh excluding any subsidy or compensation comparable to that of wind energy 19 with the additional advantage that sge can be generated continuously 24 h per day and 365 days a year unlike wind or solar energy 20 wwtps have the challenge to boost reclamation of treated ww at the same time that fossil fuels based energy consumption is reduced in this sense wwtps located in coastal areas where sw can be used as high concentration stream to feed red units are ideal frameworks for harvesting sge red technology will be fed by sw on one inlet and by the treated secondary effluent rw on the second one power recovery from these streams can account for 0 63 w m2 per membrane pair installed 21 in addition the flowrate of the high concentration stream can be adapted to the available flowrate of wwtp discharges in order to ensure its optimum exploitation currently the bottle neck for water reclamation processes is the tradeoff between the adequate treatment to make possible the reuse of water and the minimization of energy consumption in sge red systems the main problem associated with the use of biologically treated ww lies on the presence of divalent ions such as magnesium mg2 calcium ca2 and sulphate so4 2 and particulate matter which can affect membrane resistance or cause membrane fouling at medium and long term operation thus lowering power performance 22 29 however working with rw would avoid these issues feeding the red stack for internal energy recovery before end use applications this work aims to demonstrate the viability of water reclamation at the same time that energy is recovered by sge red technology avoiding the typical fouling issues arising from its operation a coastal plant was selected to facilitate the use of sw as high concentrated solution whereas treated secondary effluents rw were employed as low concentrated solution a simple reclamation treatment consisting of coagulation flocculation and decantation stages followed by filtration to remove solids was applied to treat secondary ww this stream was then continuously used for power generation over 480 h in a red stack the reclamation treatment applied to the secondary effluent and the slight increase in salinity after the energy recovery step contributed to produce water with high enough quality for further reuse 30 thus we underline the benefits of coupling the concepts and practice of ww reclamation and sge harvesting to offer more sustainable strategies for water reclamation and reuse in coastal wwtps 2 materials and methods 2 1 treatment for secondary ww effluent a secondary biologically treated wwtp effluent was subjected to a relatively simple treatment to increase water quality and allow further reuse as reclaimed water rw and at the same time to meet the standards to feed the red sge stack this effluent was first characterized by an initial silt density index sdi of 76 28 this index is a measure for the fouling capacity of water and was determined according to the astm d4189 95 2002 standard 29 in addition the initial turbidity of the wwtp effluent was as high as 6 72 ntus which exceeds the standard limits for reclaimed water a trade off between the intensity of the treatments applied to the secondary effluent and the water quality standards for further use needs to be found this fact is motivated by the energy costs associated with treatment operations since a depth filtration implies high energy consumption a coagulation flocculation process was employed in order to reduce the following critical parameters sdi turbidity total suspended solids tss and chemical oxygen demand cod which are indicators of water quality with restricted limits depending on water standards coagulation is commonly used prior to sedimentation in order to remove particles specifically the process of coagulation neutralises charge and forms large flocs coming from finely divided particles from its part in flocculation processes the colloids come out of the suspension due to the addition of a clarifying agent the secondary effluent was first coagulated using aluminium sulphate acideka spain at 265 0 mg l and then flocculated with polyacrylamide a e vallés spain at 2 0 mg l followed by settling for 24 h subsequently filtration was performed using cartridge filters of up to 10 μm fig 1 summarises the treatment applied to the secondary ww stream for its part seawater sw was treated with filters of 1 μm to remove all the particulate matter from this stream afterwards ultraviolet disinfection was applied fig 2 shows the scheme of the treatment as it will be discussed in the following section the treatments applied to rw and sw effluents were suitable to avoid the fouling issues that different authors have previously reported when working with natural and waste streams to feed red stacks 26 27 31 33 2 2 sge red experiments the sge experiments were performed using a red stack comprising 20 cell pairs formed by anion and cation exchange membranes aems and cems respectively with commercial names fks 50 and fas 50 respectively and supplied by fumatech each membrane had 36 cm2 of area 50 μm of thickness and membranes were arranged alternately between commercial polyethersulfone spacers with a porosity of 82 5 fumatech germany aems and cems membranes were characterized by the permselectivity ranges of 0 92 0 96 and 0 97 0 99 for kcl concentrations between 0 1 and 0 5 m respectively at the ends of the stack an electrode rinse solution ers composed of 0 05 m k3fe cn 6 0 05 m k4fe cn 6 scharlau purity 99 0 and 0 25 m nacl fisher chemicals assay 99 5 was continuously recirculated through the anodic and cathodic compartments to maintain electroneutrality by means of redox reactions rw coming from the process depicted in fig 1 was used as lc solution while sw coming from the cantabrian sea spain was used as hc solution after the treatment described in fig 2 the flowrates of rw and sw streams were 130 ml min equivalent to a linear velocity of 1 19 cm s these flowrates were selected to comply with the constraints of linear velocity of the stack 1 0 2 0 cm s an electronic load was used to perform the experiments chroma systems solutions 63103a usa as previously reported in other works 18 21 34 red performance is greatly influenced by temperature to avoid the influence of this parameter during operation the temperatures of the water streams were monitored and maintained constant at 24 1 c in addition the stack was isolated for temperature control using a conventional oven at the same temperature a schematic diagram of the experimental plant is shown in fig 3 a comprehensive mathematical model reported in a previous work 18 and developed in the software aspen custom model v9 aspentech was employed to predict the electrical performance of the red stack under the above mentioned conditions the response of the system in terms of open circuit voltage ocv and power output were selected to study the stability of the system over time and to detect any possible decay in performance due to the presence of membrane fouling 3 results and discussion in this section the quality of the reclaimed water obtained with the proposed tertiary treatment is presented and discussed in addition the viability of the use of rw and lc as feed streams in sge red technology is analysed finally the results obtained with red operation working with real water streams over 480 h using sw and rw as hc and lc streams respectively are presented the values achieved with the red stack are compared with results already reported in the literature 3 1 characterization of reclaimed water obtained from wwtp effluents the use of rw for urban industrial or agricultural activities is becoming a goal worldwide due to the increasing water scarcity 10 nevertheless in order to use ww effluents after treatment as rw it is necessary to comply with the existing regulations specifically eu directives as well as more restrictive policies on rw use in some european countries such as spain set the maximum values for turbidity total suspended solids tss and chemical oxygen demand cod 8 11 35 according to the data shown in table 1 the applied tertiary treatment described in fig 1 comprising the stages of coagulation flocculation decantation and filtration demonstrated to be adequate to obtain reclaimed water for different uses turbidity showed an important reduction from 6 72 before treatment to 0 4 ntu after the treatment turbidity reduction higher than 94 in the case of tss and cod the values after treatment were 7 9 mg l and 25 mg l respectively moreover the conductivity with a value of 1 8 ms cm that increased after rw use in the sge red plant also met the requirements for rw maximum limit of 3 0 ms cm the obtained reclaimed waters fulfil the allowable concentration in the target parameters such as turbidity tss or conductivity for reuse in urban activities like garden park and street irrigation fire systems or industrial applications like process or cleaning water in industrial sectors other than the food industry 6 34 9 finally total organic carbon toc a non specific indicator of water quality that measures the amount of carbon found in an organic compound was reduced over 60 thus the treatment applied was suitable to reach the required quality of rw for multiple uses as mentioned before moreover this treatment demonstrates the possibility of obtaining reclaimed water using sge red technology without penalty cost associated to energy consumption after a simple tertiary treatment moreover the treatment applied to the secondary ww effluent to obtain rw was effective at greatly reducing both sdi and toc a decrease in sdi from an initial value of 76 28 down to 13 90 was achieved implying a significant reduction of over 81 in this parameter in the case of sw after treatment a reduction of 80 was obtained in turbidity as well as tss from initial values of 4 ntus and 28 mg l respectively it was important to reduce these parameters in order to avoid the fouling issues when using sw as feeding stream in red stacks after treatment the concentrations of the main ions present in both streams were also measured as displayed in table 2 as observed the concentrations of sodium na in the hc and lc streams were 0 5 m and 0 008 m respectively which correspond to the typical average values of the salt concentration in the atlantic ocean sea and of the wwtp effluents the divalent ion specie with highest concentration in the seawater was found to be magnesium while in the case of the rw magnesium and calcium were within the same ratio because the area in which the wwtp is located is characterized by a high presence of calcite nevertheless the concentration of divalent ions in rw is lower than 20 with respect to na 3 2 experimental determination of energy potential subtracted from the salinity gradient in a red system using rw and sw in order to determine the potential energy that could be subtracted from the salinity gradient from the mixing of these two streams through red technology an assessment of model water streams composed by extra pure nacl mgcl2 cacl2 and na2so4 in distilled water taking into account the concentrations of sw and rw included in table 2 first an experiment using only nacl was performed sw 0 5 m rw 0 008 m and later the rest of salts were added fig 4 shows the gross power obtained as function of current density with both parameters normalized to effective cell pair membrane area the values accomplished when pure nacl was used are slightly higher 1 6 w m2 in comparison to the scenario in which the different divalent ions were added 1 42 w m2 these values are similar or higher than previous data reported in the literature 21 the presence of mgcl2 and cacl2 led to a drop in power output of only 10 while the addition of na2so4 did not further affect power performance these results demonstrate the possibility of using sge red in reclaimed water processes in order to favour the reduction in fossil fuel consumption once satisfactory results working with model waters were achieved the treated real water effluents sw and rw were employed as feeding streams for a red stack to confirm the viability of using a sge process the evolution of power output and ocv was monitored over time to study the stability of the red performance as representative case fig 5 shows the experimental and simulated power curves after 48 h of operation and at a fixed temperature of 24 c the simulated power curve was calculated with a mathematical model implemented in aspen custom modeler and validated in a previous work 18 the fitting between experimental and simulated curves with a difference of 14 for the points of maximum power output supports the validity of the model in predicting the red plant performance the maximum power output is normalized to the active pair membrane area 36 cm2 and the calculated power density 1 43 w m2 is among the highest values reported for natural and ww streams due to the use of rw 21 the values achieved were virtually the same as those obtained when model waters were employed fig 4 these results demonstrate that real water streams can be effectively employed in red processes being necessary to take into account the presence of mgcl2 and cacl2 in order to quantify the decrease in power performance probably due to an increase in membrane resistance 36 37 3 3 evaluation of medium term behaviour of red system using real water the appearance of fouling phenomena on anion and cation exchange membranes in red systems has been identified as a bottle neck by previous authors when real scenarios were used 25 27 29 33 38 in this sense the performance of the tertiary treatment fig 1 and a treatment for sw fig 2 for fouling prevention in the red stack is evaluated in this section through the evolution of a sge red process fed with rw and sw treated over the 20 days 480 h fig 6 shows the power obtained along this period normalized to the value obtained at 48 h 100 since this is the time at which the system reaches the stationary state as it can be observed in fig 6 the response of the system in terms of gross power remains virtually constant for the whole horizon time with no power performance decay observed in fact power performance is always within a 10 deviation with regard to the value adopted as reference for the 480 h the system was operated continuously with sw and rw and therefore these results indicate that the reclamation treatment described in section 2 2 was effective in avoiding the appearance of membrane fouling that otherwise would significantly affect power output ensuring the smooth running of the stack over time this finding represents a great progress on this technology since previous works have reported major fouling issues for the short and medium term 25 27 as it will be discussed later ocv response was also monitored to study the stability of the red system performance for the whole time horizon analyzed fig 7 shows the measured ocv normalized to the value of ocv reached at 48 h which corresponds to 3 45 v as in the case of power performance the ocv response of the red system remains almost constant over 480 h with no more than 10 deviation with respect to the reference value at all times dashed line again confirming the effectiveness of the applied treatment to maintain the high performance of the red stack after the operation time 480 h the stack was opened and examined visually to confirm that fouling was avoided using the simple treatment previously described fig 8 includes representative photographs of the membranes before and after operation specifically the surface of cation and anion exchange membranes in contact with rw streams are shown according to the images membranes offered mostly clean surfaces at the end of the experiment without observing fouling issues or deposits of blocking materials the mark visible in fig 8b corresponds to the pressure exerted by the spacers to assembly the membrane these results were also found for the membrane surfaces in contact with the sw compartments confirming that the membranes remained in good condition after 480 h of operation the results obtained are very promising since the decay in red performance related to the appearance of membrane fouling when using natural and ww streams has been frequently reported in the literature for shorter operation times than in this work vermaas et al 26 employed sw 0 5 m nacl and river water 0 017 m nacl as hc and lc solutions respectively the water streams were subjected to pre filtration through several microfilters with the final filter having a sieve size of 20 μm they observed a significant decrease in red performance after the first day more than 40 in terms of normalized power relative to theory in different stack configuration including stacks equipped with spacers and with profiled membranes di salvo et al 27 employed two types of ww to feed red stacks fish processing wastewater as hc solution 0 5 m nacl and reclaimed water from an urban wwtp as lc solution concentrations between 0 004 and 0 010 m nacl the fist type of water was treated in a pilot aerobic granular sequence batch air lift reactor system followed by further filtration 5 μm while wwtp effluent was treated in an experimental membrane bioreactor fouling issues were detected after 4 days of operation observing a decrease in ocv another representative work is that of moreno et al 29 who employed real seawater 0 3 m na and river water 0 003 m na which were passed through drum filters with an average diameter of 20 μm red performance remained well below the scenario in which specific strategies to prevent fouling accumulation during real operation time were applied e g injection of streams saturated with co2 in other work moreno et al 28 studied different types of membranes as well as different quantities of mgcl2 in order to analyse the effect of this compound as substitute of nacl in red performance results showed that mgcl2 do not affect the stability of the system however a decreased in gross power with respect to the use of pure nacl was observed due to the lower ion mobility of magnesium ions inside the membranes table 3 summarizes the gross power values reported by these authors when medium and long term experiments were carried out 26 29 in contrast to the results reported in the literature the treatment applied in this work to both types of water was effective for the medium run of the system specifically the use of red units in wwtps placed on coastal locations offers a great opportunity since sw can be employed as high concentrated solution on the other hand the use of rw as feeding solution opens room for a significant exploitation potential thus the results obtained in this manuscript offer a step forward for producing rw with zero energy consumption due to the use of red technology nevertheless new experiments increasing the temporal horizon may be need to be approached in future research works 4 conclusions a novel strategy for water reclamation with simultaneous energy generation from the mixing of rw and sw streams through red technology has been proposed after harvesting sge the quality of rw achieved met the standards required for multiple uses in agreement with the policies developed by the european commission for water reuse the appearance of fouling issues on the anion and cation exchange membranes over a significant time horizon of 480 h was prevented for such a period the operation provided a stable power performance and constant ocv output the power outcome was validated with a previously developed mathematical model showing that the maximum power output achieved and maintained over time was very close to the value predicted by the mathematical model 1 43 w m2 this strategy would promote wastewater reclamation because the rw with slight increase in salinity in comparison to the wwtp effluent could be further applied in secondary uses after internal energy recovery finally it is worth noting that red technology could be directly used in wwtps equipped tertiary units in order to reduce fossil fuels based energy consumption declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing

14169,given the abundance of iron on the earth nitrogen contaminated water is a key region for the biogeochemical cycling of n and fe under anaerobic conditions however the biogeochemical processes between n and fe remain uncertain as do the understanding of nitrogen transformation pathways in this study the nitrogen balance for the nitrite removal process in the system containing shewanella oneidensis mr 1 and the iron oxide of either ferrihydrite or magnetite was elucidated by microbially mediated biotic and abiotic reactions with the participation of fe gas chromatography results showed that during the subsequent operation phase with the re addition of nitrite nitrite reduction by biogenic fe ii was the sole process to produce gaseous nitrogen n2o and yields of which were achieved to 65 56 and 23 13 with the ferrihydrite and magnetite systems respectively meanwhile both ferrihydrite and magnetite remained relatively stable with a small amount of phosphosiderite accompanied with biogenic fe ii formation in the start up phase reduction of nitrite to ammonia coupled with lactate oxidation could be driven by shewanella oneidensis mr 1 thus in order to remediate nitrogen pollution in aquatic environment given the intimate association between the microbial mediated fe mineralization process and the biogeochemical cycling of n it is essential to truly understand the nitrogen transformation mechanism under the coexistence of both processes keywords nitrite removal iron bioreduction shewanella oneidensis mr 1 redox cycling 1 introduction inorganic compounds of nitrogen are widespread water contaminants 1 particularly nitrite can accumulate through denitrification under anaerobic environment causing a public health problem 2 3 moreover the abundance of iron oxide in aquatic environment makes biogeochemical cycling of n associated with dissimilatory iron reduction possible 4 7 yet the actual biogeochemical redox process under such conditions remains uncertain 8 the inextricable linkages between n and fe biogeochemical processes have promising potential for nitrite nitrate removal in aquatic environment currently chemical denitrification due to its high reactivity and low cost as compared to biological and physicochemical treatments has been widely applied however the presence of ammonium as the reduction end product of nitrite makes nitrogen removal incomplete in chemical denitrification 9 among gaseous nitrogen products ng from denitrification such as nitric oxide no nitrous oxide n2o and dinitrogen n2 n2o is more readily produced than n2 in nitrite denitrification in fe ii containing systems 10 11 in general the composition of the gaseous nitrogen emission in denitrification can be calculated according to corresponding chemical balance equations however it would be more informative to elucidate the ng formation pathways through analytical detection microbial mediated reducing of nitrite and fe iii have drawn considerable attention over the past several years 12 14 the reactions could be expressed in eqs 1 6 below which can generally be happened in anoxic environment at 22 37 c over a ph range of 6 8 5 10 11 15 17 accompanied by the biogenic fe ii released from iron mineral systems with iron reducing microbes the fate of nitrite can be influenced greatly due to either the accumulation of dissolved fe ii or the formation of secondary mineral phase the new iron mineral generated under the bioreduction process 18 20 moreover the differences in bioavailability of iron mineral may be largely responsible for the discrepancy of biogenic fe ii generation 21 about which few studies have been reported simultaneously although it has been recognized that both abiotic and biotic pathways for nitrite reduction are involved in biogeochemical n cycle 22 questions still remain on 1 the relative contribution of chemical and microbial reactions and 2 the interaction of these two reactions 23 1

of this research were to detail the nitrogen transformation pathways in these iron redox cycling systems and illustrate the influence of biogenic fe ii on the end products in those systems 2 material and methods 2 1 iron hydr oxides preparation and incubation of shewanella oneidensis mr 1 ferrihydrite and magnetite were synthesized according to the previously published method 24 shewanella oneidensis mr 1 a high efficiency type strain was provided by the marine culture collection of china mccc cells were grown aerobically in luria bertani medium at 30 c for 20 h to reach the mid log phase after the cells were collected by centrifugation at 10 000 rpm for 10 min and then washed three times with sterilized deionized water cells were re suspended in the sterile and anaerobic 99 99 he mineral medium to harvest a cell suspension with an optical density λ 600 nm of approximately 1 0 for the following experiments 2 2 experimental setup the final concentration of approximate 5 107 cells ml of s oneidensis mr 1 were incubated with he 2500 mg l fe total fe ii and fe iii of ferrihydrite fe oh 3 or magnetite fe3o4 and 30 mg l no2 n nitrite as an intermediate product in the nitrogen cycle usually can accumulate through denitrification under anaerobic environment furthermore it attracted the less attention even though the more toxic for microbe than nitrate in anaerobic experiments lactate c3h5o3na 50 mm and sodium anthraquinone 2 6 disulfonate aqds 100 μm were added as the electron donor and electron shuttle respectively the ph measured after all components had been mixed was 6 8 serum bottle reactors were incubated in thermostatic shaker 100 rpm maintained at 30 0 5 c in the dark the batch tests for nitrogen transformation and mineral conversion analysis were conducted within 75 h and 180 h respectively and the second addition of nitrite was at 30 h all materials were autoclaved at 121 c for 30 min before use 2 3 chemical analysis sampling was conducted with sterile syringes and needles and then filtered through 0 22 μm ptfe filters dissolved no2 n no3 n and nh4 n were measured by spectrophotometry 25 27 the concentrations of fe ii containing adsorbed and dissolved fe ii were analyzed using the ferrozine method 28 gaseous nitrogen was detected by gc gc 2010 plus shimadzu japan the standard curve was drawn by an external standard method which was prepared with a gas standard including 400 ppm of no2 1000 ppm of n2 and 600 ppm n2o formulated with he the gas stream was manually sampled for the analysis of gc according to the standard curve the concentrations of no2 n2 and n2o can be calculated the xrd patterns of magnetite ferrihydrite and the solid phase products were recorded on a rigaku d max rbx x ray diffractometer with cu kα radiation λ 0 154 nm the scanning rate was 8 min in the 2θ range of 5 80 each treatment in the experiments was replicated three times the data were statistically analysed by origin version 9 0 massachusetts originlab usa which were expressed as the mean standard deviation sd 3 results and discussion 3 1 nitrogen transformation profiles for nitrite removal by s oneidensis mr 1 although nitrite was reported to be toxicity to microorganisms previous experiment found s oneidensis mr 1 could be survived at the concentration of 30 mg l 24 results showed that during the process of nitrite reduction by s oneidensis mr 1 fig 1 a no2 n was completely removed within 30 h of the reaction whereas nh4 n gradually formed as the final product nitrite respiration involves either of denitrification and nitrate ammonification pathways 29 respiratory denitrification is catalyzed by two distinct enzymes the nirk and nirs enzymes which reduce nitrite to nitric oxide the nrfa enzyme reduces nitrite to ammonium in respiratory nitrate ammonification 30 31 however the shewanella oneidensis mr 1 genome only contains an nrfa gene 32 thereby causing the sole end product ammonium to verify nitrogen balance of the system nitrogen contents of various types of n was calculated table 1 in the system the no2 n removal efficiency was 99 93 and the end products remained as nh4 n 99 03 and no3 n 0 9 indicating total nitrogen tn keep consistent therefore it is not possible to produce gaseous nitrogen through the action of the microbe alone for the purpose of total nitrogen removal 33 3 2 product profiles for nitrite removal by s oneidensis mr 1 with iron hydr oxides in the start up phase 3 2 1 nitrogen products in the solution transformation of no2 n in the redox system of fe ii fe iii with the combination of iron hydr oxides and s oneidensis mr 1 was further examined in the ferrihydrite associated s oneidensis mr 1 system no2 n was almost completely reduced to nh4 n within 20 h while tn remained the same fig 2 a compared with the microbial system without the iron mineral where no2 n was almost completely removed within 28 h of incubation the removal efficiency of the no2 n was increased similar result was obtained in the magnetite s oneidensis mr 1 system fig 2b to verify the nitrogen balance of the microbial associated iron minerals nitrogen contents of various types of n in each system were calculated table 1 in the ferrihydrite system removal efficiency of no2 n was 99 84 the final products were nh4 n 99 70 and no3 n 0 14 by contrast no2 n was almost completely reduced to nh4 n 99 62 in the magnetite system leaving no no3 n therefore in both systems no2 n was almost completely eliminated and the reduction products mainly remained as nh4 n in the start up phase 3 2 2 formation of solid conversion forms accompanying the reduction of nitrite fe iii can also be used as an electron acceptor by s oneidensis mr 1 due to its respiration versatility 34 which was confirmed by the experiment fig 1b excluding the possibility of apparent reactivity between iron minerals and nitrite 24 tests showed that biogenic fe ii gradually formed in both systems 35 both ferrihydrite and magnetite were reduced by s oneidensis mr 1 to produce nearly 200 mg l and 100 mg l fe ii dissolved and adsorbed fe ii respectively it was noted that in the presence of no2 n the bioreduction of both ferrihydrite and magnetite were inhibited weekly at the beginning of the start up phase due to the prior reduction of no2 n by s oneidensis mr 1 compared to fe iii 34 however the concentration of biogenic fe ii in both systems reached the maximum at 30 h which showed that the addition of no2 n was able to delay the onset of biogenic fe ii formation but did not prevent the system from reaching the same final fe ii concentration or in a same amount of time in this work the xrd results showed that ferrihydrite in the ferrihydrite s oneidensis mr 1 system was transformed into magnetite in an amorphous state with a higher bioavailability which was higher than that in the magnetite s oneidensis mr 1 system 22 as a comparison magnetite in the magnetite s oneidensis mr 1 system maintained its morphological characteristics a small amount of phosphosiderite was detected in the magnetite s oneidensis mr 1 system because of the phosphorus from the medium fig s1 3 3 product profiles for nitrite removal by s oneidensis mr 1 with iron hydr oxides in the post treatment operation phase 3 3 1 nitrogen products in liquid nitrite was reduced to ammonium while iron minerals were transformed to biogenic fe ii by s oneidensis mr 1 during the start up phase a number of studies demonstrated that biogenic fe ii minerals could transfer electrons to pollutants thereby playing the role of reactive chemical reductant 36 38 as shown in fig 2 after 30 mg l of no2 n was added into the two systems again the biogenic fe ii generated from the biotic process reacted with nitrite rapidly and played a dominant role in the nitrite removal process 22 39 remarkably tn concentration was decreased in the solution in both systems which suggested the reduction of nitrite to gaseous nitrogen ng because nh4 n was the sole end product during the start up phase nitrite reduction by biogenic fe ii in the subsequent operation phase must be the process that produced gaseous nitrogen therefore the decrease of tn can be attributed to an abiotic pathway 3 3 2 gaseous nitrogen nitrogen balance analysis during the operation phase suggested production of gaseous nitrogen it is essential to investigate the components and contents of the gaseous nitrogen in both iron hydr oxides systems air from the headspace of the anaerobic serum vials was injected with a syringe into the gc after 24 h of reaction and the results of gc chromatogram are shown in fig 3 a strong peak at 0 8 min represented the air which was caused by the process of sample measurement the peaks at 2 27 and 2 97 min represented co2 and n2o respectively notably the peak areas were different in the two systems which were confirmed in table 1 the n2o emission was 65 56 and 23 13 of tn in the ferrihydrite and magnetite s oneidensis mr 1 systems respectively which was increased with biogenic fe ii concentration obtained from the start up phase the results suggested that the reduction of total nitrogen was equal to the amount of gaseous nitrogen n2o produced a mount of n2 was generated in the presence of cu2 at ph 8 40 no was observed under the higher ph ph 8 and lower fe ii 0 9 mm conditions in contrast the conditions of circumneutral ph and high concentration of adsorbed fe ii favour the formation of n2o during the process of fe ii oxidation coupled to nitrite reduction 10 the systems in this study were all at ph 7 and the concentrations of fe ii were either 1 52 mm or 3 35 mm which favored n2o formation 3 3 3 process of solid form conversions in the presence of the oxidant nitrite both ferrihydrite and magnetite were transformed to secondary minerals but to different degrees 41 42 the xrd patterns of the solid phase products in the ferrihydrite and magnetite associated s oneidensis mr 1 systems during multiple nitrite reactions are shown in fig s2 undergoing the initial start up and subsequent operation processes ferrihydrite was first completely biotic reduced to magnetite and then gradually abiotic oxidized to return to ferrihydrite when reaction time reached 75 h fig s2 a it is worth noting that with the repeated nitrite addition and after the fourth denitrification cycle was completed after 180 h the solid phase of the system was detected still as amorphous ferrihydrite with a small amount of phosphosiderite it was possibly caused by the chemical combination of fe ii with h2po 4 added as an essential trace element for microbial growth 43 in contrast in the microbial mediated magnetite system the solid phase samples were mainly magnetite with a small amount of phosphosiderite after six cycles of nitrite removal with the same reaction time of 180 h fig s2 b recently biogenic iron based materials particularly magnetite were thought to be the emerging catalysts for environmental remediation owing to their economic efficiency 19 44 our result that fe minerals remained mainly stable under multiple nitrite removal within 180 h indicated a potential application for biogenic fe minerals 3 4 elucidation of the nitrite removal mechanism in different phases a variety of substrates such as no2 and fe iii can serve as terminal electron acceptors by dissimilatory iron reduction bacteria furthermore in the presence of both these electron acceptors microbial mediated nitrite and fe iii reductions occur simultaneously 34 s oneidensis mr

first 20 h of the start up phase nitrite was completely reduced to ammonium and fe ii was gradually generated by the bacterium during the operation phase chemodenitrification of no2 n was dominant with biogenic fe ii with n2o and nh4 n as the final products achieving total nitrogen reduction the different amount of biogenic fe ii produced in ferrihydrite and magnetite systems led to the different yield of n2o as a whole reduction of nitrite to ammonium accompanied with biogenic fe ii formation in the start up phase was driven by shewanella oneidensis mr 1 undergoing the subsequent operation phase the biogenic fe ii reduced nitrite to gaseous nitrogen ng or nh4 n rapidly and played a dominant role in the nitrite removal process 4 conclusions in this study the nitrogen balance

14169,given the abundance of iron on the earth nitrogen contaminated water is a key region for the biogeochemical cycling of n and fe under anaerobic conditions however the biogeochemical processes between n and fe remain uncertain as do the understanding of nitrogen transformation pathways in this study the nitrogen balance for the nitrite removal process in the system containing shewanella oneidensis mr 1 and the iron oxide of either ferrihydrite or magnetite was elucidated by microbially mediated biotic and abiotic reactions with the participation of fe gas chromatography results showed that during the subsequent operation phase with the re addition of nitrite nitrite reduction by biogenic fe ii was the sole process to produce gaseous nitrogen n2o and yields of which were achieved to 65 56 and 23 13 with the ferrihydrite and magnetite systems respectively meanwhile both ferrihydrite and magnetite remained relatively stable with a small amount of phosphosiderite accompanied with biogenic fe ii formation in the start up phase reduction of nitrite to ammonia coupled with lactate oxidation could be driven by shewanella oneidensis mr 1 thus in order to remediate nitrogen pollution in aquatic environment given the intimate association between the microbial mediated fe mineralization process and the biogeochemical cycling of n it is essential to truly understand the nitrogen transformation mechanism under the coexistence of both processes keywords nitrite removal iron bioreduction shewanella oneidensis mr 1 redox cycling 1 introduction inorganic compounds of nitrogen are widespread water contaminants 1 particularly nitrite can accumulate through denitrification under anaerobic environment causing a public health problem 2 3 moreover the abundance of iron oxide in aquatic environment makes biogeochemical cycling of n associated with dissimilatory iron reduction possible 4 7 yet the actual biogeochemical redox process under such conditions remains uncertain 8 the inextricable linkages between n and fe biogeochemical processes have promising potential for nitrite nitrate removal in aquatic environment currently chemical denitrification due to its high reactivity and low cost as compared to biological and physicochemical treatments has been widely applied however the presence of ammonium as the reduction end product of nitrite makes nitrogen removal incomplete in chemical denitrification 9 among gaseous nitrogen products ng from denitrification such as nitric oxide no nitrous oxide n2o and dinitrogen n2 n2o is more readily produced than n2 in nitrite denitrification in fe ii containing systems 10 11 in general the composition of the gaseous nitrogen emission in denitrification can be calculated according to corresponding chemical balance equations however it would be more informative to elucidate the ng formation pathways through analytical detection microbial mediated reducing of nitrite and fe iii have drawn considerable attention over the past several years 12 14 the reactions could be expressed in eqs 1 6 below which can generally be happened in anoxic environment at 22 37 c over a ph range of 6 8 5 10 11 15 17 accompanied by the biogenic fe ii released from iron mineral systems with iron reducing microbes the fate of nitrite can be influenced greatly due to either the accumulation of dissolved fe ii or the formation of secondary mineral phase the new iron mineral generated under the bioreduction process 18 20 moreover the differences in bioavailability of iron mineral may be largely responsible for the discrepancy of biogenic fe ii generation 21 about which few studies have been reported simultaneously although it has been recognized that both abiotic and biotic pathways for nitrite reduction are involved in biogeochemical n cycle 22 questions still remain on 1 the relative contribution of chemical and microbial reactions and 2 the interaction of these two reactions 23 1

of this research were to detail the nitrogen transformation pathways in these iron redox cycling systems and illustrate the influence of biogenic fe ii on the end products in those systems 2 material and methods 2 1 iron hydr oxides preparation and incubation of shewanella oneidensis mr 1 ferrihydrite and magnetite were synthesized according to the previously published method 24 shewanella oneidensis mr 1 a high efficiency type strain was provided by the marine culture collection of china mccc cells were grown aerobically in luria bertani medium at 30 c for 20 h to reach the mid log phase after the cells were collected by centrifugation at 10 000 rpm for 10 min and then washed three times with sterilized deionized water cells were re suspended in the sterile and anaerobic 99 99 he mineral medium to harvest a cell suspension with an optical density λ 600 nm of approximately 1 0 for the following experiments 2 2 experimental setup the final concentration of approximate 5 107 cells ml of s oneidensis mr 1 were incubated with he 2500 mg l fe total fe ii and fe iii of ferrihydrite fe oh 3 or magnetite fe3o4 and 30 mg l no2 n nitrite as an intermediate product in the nitrogen cycle usually can accumulate through denitrification under anaerobic environment furthermore it attracted the less attention even though the more toxic for microbe than nitrate in anaerobic experiments lactate c3h5o3na 50 mm and sodium anthraquinone 2 6 disulfonate aqds 100 μm were added as the electron donor and electron shuttle respectively the ph measured after all components had been mixed was 6 8 serum bottle reactors were incubated in thermostatic shaker 100 rpm maintained at 30 0 5 c in the dark the batch tests for nitrogen transformation and mineral conversion analysis were conducted within 75 h and 180 h respectively and the second addition of nitrite was at 30 h all materials were autoclaved at 121 c for 30 min before use 2 3 chemical analysis sampling was conducted with sterile syringes and needles and then filtered through 0 22 μm ptfe filters dissolved no2 n no3 n and nh4 n were measured by spectrophotometry 25 27 the concentrations of fe ii containing adsorbed and dissolved fe ii were analyzed using the ferrozine method 28 gaseous nitrogen was detected by gc gc 2010 plus shimadzu japan the standard curve was drawn by an external standard method which was prepared with a gas standard including 400 ppm of no2 1000 ppm of n2 and 600 ppm n2o formulated with he the gas stream was manually sampled for the analysis of gc according to the standard curve the concentrations of no2 n2 and n2o can be calculated the xrd patterns of magnetite ferrihydrite and the solid phase products were recorded on a rigaku d max rbx x ray diffractometer with cu kα radiation λ 0 154 nm the scanning rate was 8 min in the 2θ range of 5 80 each treatment in the experiments was replicated three times the data were statistically analysed by origin version 9 0 massachusetts originlab usa which were expressed as the mean standard deviation sd 3 results and discussion 3 1 nitrogen transformation profiles for nitrite removal by s oneidensis mr 1 although nitrite was reported to be toxicity to microorganisms previous experiment found s oneidensis mr 1 could be survived at the concentration of 30 mg l 24 results showed that during the process of nitrite reduction by s oneidensis mr 1 fig 1 a no2 n was completely removed within 30 h of the reaction whereas nh4 n gradually formed as the final product nitrite respiration involves either of denitrification and nitrate ammonification pathways 29 respiratory denitrification is catalyzed by two distinct enzymes the nirk and nirs enzymes which reduce nitrite to nitric oxide the nrfa enzyme reduces nitrite to ammonium in respiratory nitrate ammonification 30 31 however the shewanella oneidensis mr 1 genome only contains an nrfa gene 32 thereby causing the sole end product ammonium to verify nitrogen balance of the system nitrogen contents of various types of n was calculated table 1 in the system the no2 n removal efficiency was 99 93 and the end products remained as nh4 n 99 03 and no3 n 0 9 indicating total nitrogen tn keep consistent therefore it is not possible to produce gaseous nitrogen through the action of the microbe alone for the purpose of total nitrogen removal 33 3 2 product profiles for nitrite removal by s oneidensis mr 1 with iron hydr oxides in the start up phase 3 2 1 nitrogen products in the solution transformation of no2 n in the redox system of fe ii fe iii with the combination of iron hydr oxides and s oneidensis mr 1 was further examined in the ferrihydrite associated s oneidensis mr 1 system no2 n was almost completely reduced to nh4 n within 20 h while tn remained the same fig 2 a compared with the microbial system without the iron mineral where no2 n was almost completely removed within 28 h of incubation the removal efficiency of the no2 n was increased similar result was obtained in the magnetite s oneidensis mr 1 system fig 2b to verify the nitrogen balance of the microbial associated iron minerals nitrogen contents of various types of n in each system were calculated table 1 in the ferrihydrite system removal efficiency of no2 n was 99 84 the final products were nh4 n 99 70 and no3 n 0 14 by contrast no2 n was almost completely reduced to nh4 n 99 62 in the magnetite system leaving no no3 n therefore in both systems no2 n was almost completely eliminated and the reduction products mainly remained as nh4 n in the start up phase 3 2 2 formation of solid conversion forms accompanying the reduction of nitrite fe iii can also be used as an electron acceptor by s oneidensis mr 1 due to its respiration versatility 34 which was confirmed by the experiment fig 1b excluding the possibility of apparent reactivity between iron minerals and nitrite 24 tests showed that biogenic fe ii gradually formed in both systems 35 both ferrihydrite and magnetite were reduced by s oneidensis mr 1 to produce nearly 200 mg l and 100 mg l fe ii dissolved and adsorbed fe ii respectively it was noted that in the presence of no2 n the bioreduction of both ferrihydrite and magnetite were inhibited weekly at the beginning of the start up phase due to the prior reduction of no2 n by s oneidensis mr 1 compared to fe iii 34 however the concentration of biogenic fe ii in both systems reached the maximum at 30 h which showed that the addition of no2 n was able to delay the onset of biogenic fe ii formation but did not prevent the system from reaching the same final fe ii concentration or in a same amount of time in this work the xrd results showed that ferrihydrite in the ferrihydrite s oneidensis mr 1 system was transformed into magnetite in an amorphous state with a higher bioavailability which was higher than that in the magnetite s oneidensis mr 1 system 22 as a comparison magnetite in the magnetite s oneidensis mr 1 system maintained its morphological characteristics a small amount of phosphosiderite was detected in the magnetite s oneidensis mr 1 system because of the phosphorus from the medium fig s1 3 3 product profiles for nitrite removal by s oneidensis mr 1 with iron hydr oxides in the post treatment operation phase 3 3 1 nitrogen products in liquid nitrite was reduced to ammonium while iron minerals were transformed to biogenic fe ii by s oneidensis mr 1 during the start up phase a number of studies demonstrated that biogenic fe ii minerals could transfer electrons to pollutants thereby playing the role of reactive chemical reductant 36 38 as shown in fig 2 after 30 mg l of no2 n was added into the two systems again the biogenic fe ii generated from the biotic process reacted with nitrite rapidly and played a dominant role in the nitrite removal process 22 39 remarkably tn concentration was decreased in the solution in both systems which suggested the reduction of nitrite to gaseous nitrogen ng because nh4 n was the sole end product during the start up phase nitrite reduction by biogenic fe ii in the subsequent operation phase must be the process that produced gaseous nitrogen therefore the decrease of tn can be attributed to an abiotic pathway 3 3 2 gaseous nitrogen nitrogen balance analysis during the operation phase suggested production of gaseous nitrogen it is essential to investigate the components and contents of the gaseous nitrogen in both iron hydr oxides systems air from the headspace of the anaerobic serum vials was injected with a syringe into the gc after 24 h of reaction and the results of gc chromatogram are shown in fig 3 a strong peak at 0 8 min represented the air which was caused by the process of sample measurement the peaks at 2 27 and 2 97 min represented co2 and n2o respectively notably the peak areas were different in the two systems which were confirmed in table 1 the n2o emission was 65 56 and 23 13 of tn in the ferrihydrite and magnetite s oneidensis mr 1 systems respectively which was increased with biogenic fe ii concentration obtained from the start up phase the results suggested that the reduction of total nitrogen was equal to the amount of gaseous nitrogen n2o produced a mount of n2 was generated in the presence of cu2 at ph 8 40 no was observed under the higher ph ph 8 and lower fe ii 0 9 mm conditions in contrast the conditions of circumneutral ph and high concentration of adsorbed fe ii favour the formation of n2o during the process of fe ii oxidation coupled to nitrite reduction 10 the systems in this study were all at ph 7 and the concentrations of fe ii were either 1 52 mm or 3 35 mm which favored n2o formation 3 3 3 process of solid form conversions in the presence of the oxidant nitrite both ferrihydrite and magnetite were transformed to secondary minerals but to different degrees 41 42 the xrd patterns of the solid phase products in the ferrihydrite and magnetite associated s oneidensis mr 1 systems during multiple nitrite reactions are shown in fig s2 undergoing the initial start up and subsequent operation processes ferrihydrite was first completely biotic reduced to magnetite and then gradually abiotic oxidized to return to ferrihydrite when reaction time reached 75 h fig s2 a it is worth noting that with the repeated nitrite addition and after the fourth denitrification cycle was completed after 180 h the solid phase of the system was detected still as amorphous ferrihydrite with a small amount of phosphosiderite it was possibly caused by the chemical combination of fe ii with h2po 4 added as an essential trace element for microbial growth 43 in contrast in the microbial mediated magnetite system the solid phase samples were mainly magnetite with a small amount of phosphosiderite after six cycles of nitrite removal with the same reaction time of 180 h fig s2 b recently biogenic iron based materials particularly magnetite were thought to be the emerging catalysts for environmental remediation owing to their economic efficiency 19 44 our result that fe minerals remained mainly stable under multiple nitrite removal within 180 h indicated a potential application for biogenic fe minerals 3 4 elucidation of the nitrite removal mechanism in different phases a variety of substrates such as no2 and fe iii can serve as terminal electron acceptors by dissimilatory iron reduction bacteria furthermore in the presence of both these electron acceptors microbial mediated nitrite and fe iii reductions occur simultaneously 34 s oneidensis mr 1 as a model microorganism was shown to be able to conduct reduction of nitrite to ammonium in previous studies 29 45 as is shown in fig 4 our study confirmed this reduction by showing that during the first 20 h of the start up phase nitrite was completely reduced to ammonium and fe ii was gradually generated by the bacterium during the operation phase chemodenitrification of no2 n was dominant with biogenic fe ii with n2o and nh4 n as the final products achieving total nitrogen reduction the different amount of biogenic fe ii produced in ferrihydrite and magnetite systems led to the
