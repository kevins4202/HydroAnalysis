9200,irrigation enables crop intensification and improves the smallholder s household livelihood centre pivot irrigation a system predominantly used in medium to large individual farms has recently been promoted for smallholder collective irrigation in developing countries the objective of this research was to assess the irrigation performance and evolution of shared centre pivot systems at the itamarati rural settlement in the midwest of brazil where around 1000 smallholders were organized in small groups between 2001 and 2004 to farm 85 centre pivots collectively quantitative and qualitative data were collected in a mixed approach and used to characterize the evolution and sustainability of the centre pivots shared we collected information from published and unpublished reports and we conducted our own surveys interviewing twenty five farm groups and forming focus groups in a 3 year phased process irrigation intensity the ratio of irrigated area over the area equipped for irrigation declined sharply from 0 75 in 2004 2005 0 12 in 2020 the immediate pressures triggering the abandonment process were the farmers insufficient technical capability low productivity of the irrigated crops and high operational and maintenance costs at the root of these drivers was the incapacity to exert the collective action required by the highly centralized shared centre pivot system the progressive giving up of collective management and the concentration of land in larger farms seems to be inexorable the itamarati experience was a paradigm of a top down project whose lessons are important for policymakers we concluded that centralized collective systems are unsustainable unless the community that adopts them has a high sense of union and a capacity for collective action keywords centre pivot centralized collective irrigation irrigation intensity collective action data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction in most developing countries agriculture is the main economic sector smallholders produce much of the developing world s food graeub et al 2016 in brazil they are also responsible for employing 10 1 million people ibge 2017 irrigation is considered to be a strategical practice for crop intensification and diversification it improves household livelihoods and welfare hussain 2007 malik et al 2014 akrofi et al 2019 thus governments have undertaken national irrigation programmes to promote smallholder irrigation schemes souza et al 2001 valdes et al 2004 borgia et al 2013 mutambara et al 2016 araujo et al 2019 however the yield irrigation performance and sustainability of smallholder irrigation schemes are extremely variable hussain 2007 borgia et al 2013 gonçalves et al 2015 özmen and kaman 2015 mutambara et al 2016 with many schemes performing below expectations garcía bolaños et al 2011 valdes et al 2004 terra 2010 despite modernization and rehabilitation projects having tried to counteract their deterioration and poor performance valdes et al 2004 lecina et al 2010 mateos et al 2010 rodríguez díaz et al 2012 mutambara et al 2016 castelli et al 2018 tarjuelo et al 2015 many modernization and rehabilitation projects include the transference of irrigation management to water users associations or if the latter already exist the strengthening of collective action and group empowerment salgado et al 2021 in smallholder irrigation farming two irrigation scheme models are found i large scale ones of several hundred or thousand ha centrally managed by public agencies ii small scale schemes comprising a variety of distributed irrigation models that include village community managed schemes women s gardens private farms owned by individuals and others a variety of irrigation systems are used in small scale schemes from the most traditional surface irrigation with earth channels to modern micro irrigation with pressurized pipes centre pivot irrigation systems are predominantly used in medium to large farms under individual management however recent ground breaking initiatives are promoting shared centre pivot for smallholder farming in developing countries particularly in africa each farmer cultivates his her land individually and the farmers as a group share the operation and maintenance of the system so that they collectively cover the project s cost while benefitting from the advantages of centre pivot irrigation berkland 2018 smallholder irrigation schemes require a high level of collective action the latter s success relies on community mobilization mutual trust and reciprocity active participation and a self organization ability agrawal 2001 wang et al 2013 malik et al 2014 mutambara et al 2016 akrofi et al 2019 theesfeld 2004 araral 2009 wang et al 2013 takayama et al 2018 the characteristics inherent to centre pivots entail centralised management if used as a collective system the latter therefore becomes vital since the consequences of malfunctioning will affect the whole group of farmers depending on the system clemmens 2006 moreover the centre pivot s high investment operational and maintenance costs may be an additional handicap since a farmer s willingness to invest in a common pool resource reduces when he she has to share the costs to our knowledge no studies on shared centre pivot experiences have been reported the unique case at the itamarati rural settlement where the brazilian government installed more than 1000 settlers to share 85 centre pivots is therefore of great value to policymakers and planners the objective of this research is to document the evolution of the activity in the centre pivots of the settlement and to investigate the factors that have led to its current situation a phased field research was carried out for 3 years in which university students the offspring of settlement inhabitants acted as interviewees and participants the results and their discussion are based on two lines of thought the attitude and capacity of farmers for collective action and the determinants of technology adoption in this case of centre pivot irrigation in development projects the analysis is inspired by two frameworks the general framework for analysing sustainability of socio ecological systems ostrom 2009 and the critical institutional analysis and development framework cleaver 2012 whaley 2018 2 material and methods 2 1 the itamarati rural settlement irrigation scheme the itamarati rural settlement irrigation scheme irsis is in the state of mato grosso do sul brazil in the cerrado tropical savannah ecoregion of centre west brazil between latitudes 22º11 and 22º38 s and longitudes 55º30 55º75 w fig 1 climate in the region is semi humid tropical with hot rainy summers and cool dry winters mean annual rainfall is 1450 mm concentrated between september and may rainy season water deficit may also occur during the rainy season due to high evapotranspiration and irregular rainfall distribution fietz et al 2001 soils are clayey classified as ferralsols fao 2006 with a scanty water holding capacity and easy drainage urchei et al 2002 irsis was developed in the early 2000 s after the brazilian government purchased the itamarati farm a private agribusiness that went bankrupt after transforming the farm into large scale high productivity agriculture to install around 2800 families the area of the farm was 50 454 ha including 90 centre pivots occupying 9690 ha the irrigation water source is the dourados river and its tributaries crossing the settlement the average minimum flow of the dourados river in september is of 35 m3 s 1 and its average maximum flow is of 165 m3 s 1 in march urchei et al 2002 water can be pumped from the various rivers and streams that cross irsis and conveyed through independent pipelines to each individual centre pivot water availability does not limit the water supply to the area equipped for irrigation irsis was set up in two phases itamarati settlement i with 58 pivots in 2001 and itamarati settlement ii with 27 pivots in 2004 the centre pivot irrigation method was not a choice when the settlement was established but was imposed by the pre existence of the irrigation equipment the most common centre pivots were manufactured by valmatic são bernardo do campo brazil and carborundum santo antonio de posse brazil five of the original 90 pivots were dismantled to build small villages for the settlers the remaining 85 pivots were handed over to 5 settler groups 4 corresponded to 4 different social communities and the fifth was formed by former staff of the itamarati farm the number of centre pivots per group varied between 13 and 15 and between 2 and 14 in itamarati settlement i and itamarati settlement ii respectively while the average irrigable area per farmer ranged between 2 and 9 5 ha table 1 the centre pivots older than 30 years have never been rehabilitated since they were handed over to the settlers the plan was that the farmers would collectively cultivate the centre pivots themselves each settler also received a small individual plot for rainfed crops the predominant crop rotation in irsis occurs during the rainy season and is soybean grown from october to february followed by maize or beans from february to may 2 2 data collection the research combined participatory research and training in a joint strategy the target group in the training component were ufgd students children of irsis settlers the research focused on the productive system under irrigation in irsis and its primary actors the settlers along with the latter the other actors who contributed to the participatory research were the staff of agraer portuguese acronym of agency for agrarian development and rural extension the research training was a phased process that lasted 3 years a documentary compilation biophysical and socioeconomic report of the study area carried out by embrapa portuguese

to represent all the social groups present in irsis focus group including 8 students 3 agraer staff and 15 settlers participatory discussion carried out by students with teacher supervision focused on the history the current situation and the difficulties of collective action d 2nd survey december 2016 february 2017 follow up of the 20 centre pivots active in 2014 that remained so in december 2016 e 3rd survey march april 2020 phone survey conducted in the centre pivots active in december 2016 and carried out by an agraer official a former student in the research team one representative of each centre pivot sampled was interviewed for the 1st and 2nd surveys by the student research team critical answers containing criticism or vital answers were crosschecked by posing selected questions to neighbour farmers the questionnaire used for the 2 surveys was structured as follows note that some questions applied only to inactive or active centre pivots identification person interviewed social group centre pivot code centre pivot length number of towers brand type of emitters pump model power status of the inactive pivots abandoned sold missing current state if present date of inactivity reason for becoming inactive requirements for returning to activity land tenure number of farmers per pivot complementary rainfed area irrigation management depth applied per irrigation frequency

the social group technical assistance difficulties of collective work and perception of sharing pivots 2 3 data analysis both qualitative and quantitative analysis were used for the research qualitative narrative interpretation was used for analysing the self knowledge of the students who formed the research team the knowledge they gained from their parents during the research the information gathered through the spontaneous interviews during the preliminary approach and the information that emerged from the focus group with settlers and agraer staff quantitative analysis consisted of a one way analysis of variance anova used to determine whether the means of yields or irrigation intensities of two or more groups were different using f tests to statistically test the equality of means snedecor and cochran 1980 anova was carried out using the data analysis toolpak of microsoft excel 3 results 3 1 the process of abandoning irrigation in 2001 all 85 centre pivots were under operation 58 in itamarati i and 27 still under the administration of the itamarati farm fig 2 in 2004 the rest of the itamarati farm became itamarati ii unfortunately 22 out of the 27 centre pivots transferred to itamarati ii were vandalised with only 5 remaining operational since then the total number of centre pivots in operation reduced dramatically in 2014 only 20 centre pivots were working and this number was halved by 2020 fig 2 the itamarati ii irrigated area over the originally irrigable one was small from the beginning 0 19 and it decreased to the current fraction of 0 11 table 2 the evolution of irrigation intensity varied between social groups fafi has kept the 2 centre pivots allocated at the creation of the settlement nowadays cut and fetagri are the two groups with the strongest irrigation intensity table 2 note that the abandonment of irrigation does not mean abandonment of agriculture the entire irrigable area is cultivated as being rainfed 3 2 irrigation equipment and management all pumps were of centrifugal type most of them manufactured in germany by ksb se co models wkl 150 2 or 150 3 with impellers of 350 mm the power of the pump motors was 250 kw 64 of the pumps surveyed or 300 kw 28 their flow rate varied from 300 to 350 m³ h 1 and their hydraulic head between 100 and 150 m the diameter of the conveyance pipes varied from 250 to 300 mm and their length from 1000 to 2300 m the typical lateral length was of 600 m covering 113 ha the most common emitters were of the spray type manufactured by fabrimar rio de janeiro brazil the hydraulic head at the entrance of the lateral was around 50 m the common irrigation practice is to run the centre pivot after five to eight days about one week without rain regardless of the cropping pattern 82 of the centre pivots surveyed were operated at 50 of full speed the outer tower moving at a speed of 132 m h 1 taking 55 65 h to complete the 360º rotation and applying about 15 mm of water per irrigation in order to minimize the energy cost irrigation is done preferably from 21 00 06 00 and avoiding the period between 17 00 and 21 00 this irrigation practice implies that generally farmers do not aim to meet the full crop water requirements however none of the farmers surveyed used soil water sensors or meteorological information to schedule irrigation despite there being a weather station located at 45 km from irsis whose data are publicly available through internet 3 3 understanding the irrigation abandonment process centre pivot breakdowns reported were electrical hydraulic and mechanical ones the former was the main cause of failure fig 3 22 electrical faults had already been reported in 2004 this number increasing to 65 in 2016 and 76 in 2016 fig 3 the amount of hydraulic failures mainly related to the motor pump with many years of use and little or no maintenance and mechanical breakdowns related to the centre pivot wheels and tyres also increased during the period of study fig 3 maintenance was limited to corrective and emergency measures no preventive maintenance was carried out one of the cooperatives installed in irsis employs two electricians who work on demand for farmers when their centre pivots need repairing theft and vandalism were at the root of most of the important irrigation system breakdowns thefts included electrical wiring transformers command boxes electric motors tyres plumbing sprinklers etc with copper being removed from control panels and transformers the elements most targeted by thieves only in 2013 approximately 36 thefts were reported during our 2014 and 2016 visits we witnessed the results of vandalism that had just occurred in 4 centre pivots vandalism was more serious in itamarati ii where only 4 of the original 23 centre pivots remained in operation the average yield of irrigated crops reported in the surveys was 3400 kg ha 1 and 5000 kg ha 1 for soybean and maize respectively however high variability between settler groups was observed with average yields varying from 2700 to 4080 kg ha 1 fig 4a and from 4200 to 7800 kg ha 1 fig 4b for soybean and maize respectively average yield of irrigated crops was less than 10 greater than that of rainfed crops fig 4ab a difference that was not statistically significant p 0 05 and came below expectations economic analyses carried out by richetti et al 2015a 2015b fixed the break even yield of irrigated crops at 3360 kg ha 1 and 7200 kg ha 1 for soybean and maize respectively thus only 64 and 22 of the soybean and maize irrigated crops achieved yields that covered production costs contrary to the crop performance under irrigation more than 90 of the rainfed soybean crops achieved higher yields than the break even yield fig 4a and 80 obtained higher yields than the average for state of mato grosso do sul 2800 kg ha 1 famasul 2019 rainfed maize did not perform so well fig 4b note that maize in irsis and the mato grosso do sul state is a secondary crop in relation to soybean 3 4 social settings and self organization the creation of irsis involved the participation of various public institutions university land reform and extension agencies research organizations and social movements which established the two development plans for irsis these plans emphasized the need for strengthening the farmers organizations necessary for the collective management of shared centre pivots and professional training of farmers who had little or no previous experience in irrigation technologies and agribusiness urchei et al 2002 incra seprod idaterra 2003 incra fcr 2006 the development plans also highlighted the importance of the collaboration with research training and technology transfer and advisory agencies and companies to intensify crop production and introduce high value crops such as vegetables and fruit trees therefore our survey aimed to find out if the planned actions required for collective work were actually implemented in irsis regarding farmers organization the surveys indicated that the majority of farmers 81 of those interviewed were dissatisfied with the collective management of shared centre pivots their reasons for dissatisfaction and the percentage of farmers giving their reasons were high operational and maintenance cost of the irrigation equipment 55 high frequency of thefts and vandalism of expensive equipment 58 lack of specialized assistance 60 weak commitment of farmers to their communities 40 and difficulties in financing collective actions farmers in irsis have access to subsidized credits from a public bank however banks do not consider a settlers group as legal entities so farmers prefer to apply for the credit individually over time the little satisfaction in collective work contributed to changes in the management of the shared centre pivots fig 5 the planned model of collective farming model a remained in some centre pivots whereas it evolved towards alternative managerial models in others thus the current models include a collective farming this original model remains in 10 of the currently active centre pivots the owners decide on the cropping pattern collectively so the centre pivot is actually a single management unit fig 6a farmers sharing the centre pivot also share the production costs and benefits the centre pivot land is usually irrigated as a whole or left to be rainfed if irrigated one member of the group is entrusted with the operation and maintenance of the irrigation equipment and the same member or another one acts as treasurer to collect irrigation fees to pay for the operational and maintenance costs b collective leasing this management model applies to 80 of the currently active centre pivots in which the tenant decides on the cropping patterns thus the field arrangement is similar to case a the tenant covers all the cultivation and irrigation costs assumes the cultivation risks and pays a rent usually 900 1000 kg ha 1 of soybean per year to the collective owner again the centre pivot land is irrigated as a whole or left to be rainfed if irrigated the operation and maintenance of the centre pivot is the responsibility of the tenant the tenant is normally one farmer 42 or a small group of 2 4 farmers 23 who may or not be members of the settlers group the satisfaction with renting is high around 75 among settlers who rent their collective areas fig 5 they argued that it reduces risk and that they can use their time for other activities to obtain extra income around 57 of farmers interviewed earned extra incomes by working outside the settlement or concentrating their work on their individual rainfed plots c individual farming each farmer decides individually on the cropping pattern for his her circle sector so that multiple crops or those under different management cover the centre pivot area fig 6b each farmer decides whether to irrigate or not pumping is turned off while the centre pivot passes over non irrigated sectors the farmers who irrigate share the cost sometimes farmers who do not irrigate do have to contribute to the irrigation equipment maintenance cost one farmer from the group is usually in charge of the operation and maintenance of the irrigation equipment and acts as treasurer d mixed individual and collective farming the pivot area is partly cultivated collectively model a and partly individually model c this management model normally arises when there is no agreement between the members of the group in this case the decisions cropping pattern water management assignation of responsibilities and distribution of operation and maintenance costs are imprecise soybean yield did not differ significantly according to the management model p 0 05 fig 7a maize yield under managerial model a was significantly higher than under the other models p 0 05 fig 7b although this difference was due to the exceptionally good performance of rainfed maize grown by the amffi social group however our survey showed that there is a high rate of members 50 in the managerial models a c and d who do not pay their fees regularly fee defaulting prevents proper maintenance and delays the payment of energy bills we hypothesized that the heterogeneity of the social group running the centre pivots could explain part of the patterns observed aggarwal 2000 theesfeld 2004 fafi and amffi could be considered to be homogeneous groups since they originated from former workers and residents from itamarati farm respectively on the contrary cut featgri and mst were considered as being heterogeneous groups since the majority of their members came from different places without previous experience in agriculture however our data did not support the hypothesis of a group homogeneity heterogeneity effect first the percentage of dissatisfaction with the collective management of shared pivots was very similar 73 and 75 in the homogeneous and heterogeneous groups respectively resulting in the same percentage of collective leasing around 55 in both types of groups second we did not observe any homogeneity effect on the number of active pivots in fact the drop in the number of active pivots between 2014 and 2016 was more notable in the more homogeneous group than in the less homogeneous one fig 8 third the mean soybean yield was significantly lower p 0 05 in the homogeneous groups than in the heterogeneous ones 14 and 23 in irrigated and rainfed respectively fig 9a while the mean maize yield under irrigation was similar in both groups p 0 05 and in rainfed was significantly higher p 0 05 in the heterogeneous groups than in the homogeneous ones fig 9b regarding technical assistance farmers complained about its lack especially of public assistance only 34 of the farmers interviewed declared that they receive some type of technical assistance mostly from private companies that supply agricultural inputs or from technicians who are members of the farmers groups farmers complained about the limited service offered by agraer the public assistance agency with an office in irsis centenaro and tavares 2017 also reported farmers dissatisfaction with public technical assistance from irsis the agraer team in irsis is composed of only one agronomist and two agricultural technicians to assist two thousand farmers and none of them are specialists in irrigation in fact only 10 of the farmers seek assistance from agraer mainly to help them with bureaucratic procedures e g applying for credit technical assistance varied between social groups in mst and cut only 8 and 12 5 respectively of farmers received support the highest percentage nearly 70 and 100 was observed in fetagri and fafi respectively several members of fetagri received technical aid from agricultural input suppliers which mainly involved crop protection seeds and fertilization technical assistance did not influence the number of current active pivots since their percentage did not vary significantly between assisted 23 4 actives of 17 pivots and non assisted 21 7 actives of 32 pivots ones on the other hand higher soybean yields were achieved in pivots where farmers received technical assistance compared to unassisted farmers the differences were 15 higher p 0 05 in both irrigated and rainfed crops fig 10 however 66 12 out of 18 of the pivots that obtained higher yields than 3500 kg ha 1 received assistance fig 10 the majority of settler groups 11 of 20 were not associated with any cooperative or association of farmers even though there are five cooperatives operating in irsis no influence of group homogeneity was found on filiations with these cooperatives cooperatives installed in irsis are devoted to post harvest and product commercialization none of them to financing crops or irrigation equipment finally crop diversification has had little success farmers only cultivate the two commodity crops soybean and maize that predominate in the region 4 discussion only 10 of the 63 centre pivots that started to operate in irsis remain active and only one of them has stayed under collective management the conclusion reached has been that the settlement project has failed why and when did the abandonment process start which factors contributed to that process the dramatic decline of active centre pivots during the first years was an indication of faulty planning during the elaboration of the two itamarati development plans settlers were invited to collaborate however they were not encouraged to participate actively terra 2010 moreover the selection of the centre pivot as a collective irrigation system was not an open and participatory decision but the convenience of leveraging irrigation equipment already in place had that not been the case the planners could have selected a different irrigation system criticism of the role of public institutions in the introduction of certain irrigation methods specifically localized irrigation in collective irrigation systems is a topical issue in the scientific literature ortega reig et al 2017 garcía mollá et al 2020 nevertheless some centre pivots continued operating while the abandonment process became gradual during successive years therefore faulty design was not the only determinant in the abandonment process our surveys revealed that the immediate reasons were the economic and technical incapability for preventive and corrective maintenance and to repair damage caused by vandalism maintenance needs were exacerbated by the age of the centre pivot systems older than 30 years thus maintenance was costly and difficult to finance through collective action the consequences are that maintenance has been deferred breakdowns are increasingly frequent the energy efficiency has declined lima et al 2009 and the energy cost has increased subsequently farmers fall into debt with the electricity company which eventually cuts off their supply in addition to the above our research showed a lack of specialized maintenance professionals the current rate of 580 ha per maintenance professional is clearly below the rate of 138 288 ha per maintenance technician recommended by koç 2018 the current state of the centre pivots in irsis points to the need for a rehabilitation project however this would involve an investment ranging from u 90 000 to 220 000 per pivot lima et al 2009 and our interviews clearly revealed that farmers cannot afford this rehabilitation cost in addition the financing programmes available are aimed at purchasing new irrigation systems for individual plots not to rehabilitate collective centre pivots as a result farmers move over to rainfed crop production as individuals or lease their farms collectively to tenants new tenants who can afford the repair costs or pay electricity bills often repair vandalized centre pivots and put them back into production therefore the process discussed above has had two consequences a significant abandonment of irrigation and an increase in the size of the smallholding through leasing as bellé et al 2013 and terra 2010 have already pointed out a similar trend was reported in india by aggrarwal 2000 who analysed the collective action in group owned wells concluding that group members preferred to invest individually despite the advantages of pooling capital and sharing risks these are therefore examples of development through bricolage cleaver 2012 explained by the critical institutional analysis and development framework whaley 2018 an additional factor that explains neglecting irrigation in irsis is that it only slightly improved soybean yield with respect to rainfed cropping 600 kg ha 1 on average 10 and showed little effect on maize yield however the potential of soybean yield increment due to irrigation reported by flumingan et al 2015 and sentelhas et al 2015 is of 2050 kg ha 1 the large yield gap under irrigation observed in irsis could be related to inadequate irrigation management the usual irrigation practice is to apply a 15 mm water depth after one week without rain although urchei et al 2002 recommended frequent applications 2 3 applications per week due to the limited water holding capacity of the ferralsol in irsis that recommendation is in accordance with the weekly water demand of 25 35 mm fietz et al 2001 flumignan et al 2015 the practice of non full irrigation is not necessarily a farmers rational decision the difficulties mentioned in collective action may be one reason for simplifying irrigation decisions another reason could be insufficient technical advice which in our research was found to be a significant determinant of the soybean crop yields indeed other studies terra 2009 bellé et al 2013 centenaro and tavares 2017 also conclude that the most pressing need at irsis is technical assistance due to the settlers farming inexperience during our interviews farmers complained about the lack of public technical assistance and training in addition the technical assistance established at irsis responded to a demand based model according to which farmers require assistance only for the problems that they perceive this model does not favour any improvement in schemes like irsis exploited by inexperienced farmers valdes et al 2004 irrigation advisory services with public support should contribute to better irrigation practices in irsis as has been claimed for other smallholder irrigation schemes in brazil mateos et al 2018 araujo et al 2019 maintenance cost and poor yield are patently evident factors explaining the abandonment of shared centre pivots in irsis however other less tangible ones could be at the root of the process our surveys revealed the feeble commitment of farmers to their communities and a pessimistic attitude towards collective action bellé et al 2013 argued that most social conflicts among farmers in irsis were due to the wide gap in cultural and life experience differences between member groups nevertheless the centre pivots managed by socially homogeneous groups fafi and amffi also manifested similar dissatisfaction with the shared centre pivot notion and showed an equally poor performance to that of the centre pivots managed by socially heterogeneous groups on the other hand irsis farmers were not highly dependent on shared centre pivots because they could achieve productive yields under rainfed conditions lease their plots and or exert other economic activities dependence on irrigation systems is recognized as being one of the key factors for success in water collective action araral 2009 wang et al 2013 takayama et al 2018 in summary in addition to the difficulties for the collective action needed to manage and maintain a shared centre pivot system theesfeld 2004 takayama et al 2018 the cost of irrigation was a major barrier to full adoption of centre pivot technology in irsis cost as a major determinant of irrigation technology adoption has been identified in other countries de witt et al 2021 tesfaye et al 2021 price et al 2022 moreover the weight of biophysical factors such as crop type and weather noted in irsis has been observed also in usa gibson et al 2018 while the lack of an extension service highlighted by irsis farmers has been reported as a barrier to adoption also in australia koech et al 2021 as observed at irsis price et al 2022 showed that the adoption of centre pivot in alabama usa depends on multiple factors operating at multiple levels 5 conclusions the itamarati plans failed they were a paradigm of a top down project in which the participation and capacity of the settlers were disregarded would it have been different if a robust training and technical assistance programme had been implemented there are signs that this would have been a possibility as soybean yields were better when farmers received advice however the conditions for the high level of collective action required by an extremely centralized system such as a shared centre pivot did not exist although the heterogeneity of the groups did not appear to be a determining factor the productive advantage of irrigation was low a timely intervention at the beginning of the abandonment spiral might have helped to overcome some of the barriers inherent to the settlement this intervention should have been oriented towards the empowerment of the settler community its technical training and assistance and the imbuement of a sense of community and an appropriation of the infrastructures that never existed however the progressive abandonment of collective management and the concentration of land in larger farms seems to have been inexorable this case study contains important lessons for policymakers centralized collective systems should not be promoted by public agencies unless the community that adopts them has a high degree of trust and sense of community and that its capacity for collective action is sufficiently robust nevertheless itamarati s experience is unique it does not imply that other experiences of shared centre pivot necessarily fail the impossibility of generalising what was observed in itamarati is the major limitation of this research although as a case study it should serve as an example and guide to identify conditions that can lead to success or failure declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence

itamarati rural settlement in the midwest of brazil where around 1000 smallholders were organized in small groups between 2001 and 2004 to farm 85 centre pivots collectively quantitative and qualitative data were collected in a mixed approach and used to characterize the evolution and sustainability of the centre pivots shared we collected information from published and unpublished reports and we conducted our own surveys interviewing twenty five farm groups and forming focus groups in a 3 year phased process irrigation intensity the ratio of irrigated area over the area equipped for irrigation declined sharply from 0 75 in 2004 2005 0 12 in 2020 the immediate pressures triggering the abandonment process were the farmers insufficient technical capability low productivity of the irrigated crops and high operational and maintenance costs at the root of these drivers was the incapacity to exert the collective action required by the highly centralized shared

developing countries agriculture is the main economic sector smallholders produce much of the developing world s food graeub et al 2016 in brazil they are also responsible for employing 10 1 million people ibge 2017 irrigation is considered to be a strategical practice for crop intensification and diversification it improves household livelihoods and welfare hussain 2007 malik et al 2014 akrofi et al 2019 thus governments have undertaken national irrigation programmes to promote smallholder irrigation schemes souza et al 2001 valdes et al 2004 borgia et al 2013 mutambara et al 2016 araujo et al 2019 however the yield irrigation performance and sustainability of smallholder irrigation schemes are extremely variable hussain 2007 borgia et al 2013 gonçalves et al 2015 özmen and kaman 2015 mutambara et al 2016 with many schemes performing below expectations garcía bolaños et al 2011 valdes et al 2004 terra 2010 despite modernization and rehabilitation projects having tried to counteract their deterioration and poor performance valdes et al 2004 lecina et al 2010 mateos et al 2010 rodríguez díaz et al 2012 mutambara et al 2016 castelli et al 2018 tarjuelo et al 2015 many modernization and rehabilitation projects include the transference of irrigation management to water users associations or if the latter already exist the strengthening of collective action and group empowerment salgado et al 2021 in smallholder irrigation farming two irrigation scheme models are found i large scale ones of several hundred or thousand ha centrally managed by public agencies ii small scale schemes comprising a variety of distributed irrigation models that include village community managed schemes women s gardens private farms owned by individuals and others a variety of irrigation systems are used in small scale schemes from the most traditional surface irrigation with earth channels to modern micro irrigation with pressurized pipes centre pivot irrigation systems are predominantly used in medium to large farms under individual management however recent ground breaking initiatives are promoting shared centre pivot for smallholder farming in developing countries particularly in africa each farmer cultivates his her land individually and the farmers as a group share the operation and maintenance of the system so that they collectively cover the project s cost while benefitting from the advantages of centre pivot irrigation berkland 2018 smallholder irrigation schemes require a high level of collective action the latter s success relies on community mobilization mutual trust and reciprocity active participation and a self organization ability agrawal 2001 wang et al 2013 malik et al 2014 mutambara et al 2016 akrofi et al 2019 theesfeld 2004 araral 2009 wang et al 2013 takayama et al 2018 the characteristics inherent to centre pivots entail centralised management if used as a collective system the latter therefore becomes vital since the consequences of malfunctioning will affect the whole group of farmers depending on the system clemmens 2006 moreover the centre pivot s high investment operational and maintenance costs may be an additional handicap since a farmer s willingness to invest in a common pool resource reduces when he she has to share the costs to our knowledge no studies on shared centre pivot experiences have been reported the unique case at the itamarati rural settlement where the brazilian government installed more than 1000 settlers to share 85 centre pivots is therefore of great value to policymakers and planners the objective of this research is to document the evolution of the activity in the centre pivots of the settlement and to investigate the factors that have led to its current situation a phased field research was carried out for 3 years in which university students the offspring of settlement inhabitants acted as interviewees and participants the results and their discussion are based on two lines of thought the attitude and capacity of farmers for collective action and the determinants of technology adoption in this case of centre pivot irrigation in development projects the analysis is inspired by two frameworks the general framework for analysing sustainability of socio ecological systems ostrom 2009 and the critical institutional analysis and development framework cleaver 2012 whaley 2018 2 material and methods 2 1 the itamarati rural settlement irrigation scheme the itamarati rural settlement irrigation scheme irsis is in the state of mato grosso do sul brazil in the cerrado tropical savannah ecoregion of centre west brazil between latitudes 22º11 and 22º38 s and longitudes 55º30 55º75 w fig 1 climate in the region is semi humid tropical with hot rainy summers and cool dry winters mean annual rainfall is 1450 mm concentrated between september and may rainy season water deficit may also occur during the rainy season due to high evapotranspiration and irregular rainfall distribution fietz et al 2001 soils are clayey classified as ferralsols fao 2006 with a scanty water holding capacity and easy drainage urchei et al 2002 irsis was developed in the early 2000 s after the brazilian government purchased the itamarati farm a private agribusiness that went bankrupt after transforming the farm into large scale high productivity agriculture to install around 2800 families the area of the farm was 50 454 ha including 90 centre pivots occupying 9690 ha the irrigation water source is the dourados river and its tributaries crossing the settlement the average minimum flow of the dourados river in september is of 35 m3 s 1 and its average maximum flow is of 165 m3 s 1 in march urchei et al 2002 water can be pumped from the various rivers and streams that cross irsis and conveyed through independent pipelines to each individual centre pivot water availability does not limit the water supply to the area equipped for irrigation irsis was set up in two phases itamarati settlement i with 58 pivots in 2001 and itamarati settlement ii with 27 pivots in 2004 the centre pivot irrigation method was not a choice when the settlement was established but was imposed by the pre existence of the irrigation equipment the most common centre pivots were manufactured by valmatic são bernardo do campo brazil and carborundum santo antonio de posse brazil five of the original 90 pivots were dismantled to build small villages for the settlers the remaining 85 pivots were handed over to 5 settler groups 4 corresponded to 4 different social communities and the fifth was formed by former staff of the itamarati farm the number of centre pivots per group varied between 13 and 15 and between 2 and 14 in itamarati settlement i and itamarati settlement ii respectively while the average irrigable area per farmer ranged between 2 and 9 5 ha table 1 the centre pivots older than 30 years have never been rehabilitated since they were handed over to the settlers the plan was that the farmers would collectively cultivate the centre pivots themselves each settler also received a small individual plot for rainfed crops the predominant crop rotation in irsis occurs during the rainy season and is soybean grown from october to february followed by maize or beans from february to may 2 2 data collection the research combined participatory research and training in a joint strategy the target group in the training component were ufgd students children of irsis settlers the research focused on the productive system under irrigation in irsis and its primary actors the settlers along with the latter the other actors who contributed to the participatory research were the staff of agraer portuguese acronym of agency for agrarian development and rural extension the research training was a phased process that lasted 3 years a documentary compilation biophysical and socioeconomic report of the study area carried out by embrapa portuguese

e 3rd survey march april 2020 phone survey conducted in the centre pivots active in december 2016 and carried out by an agraer official a former student in the research team one representative of each centre pivot sampled was interviewed for the 1st and 2nd surveys by the student research team critical answers containing criticism or vital answers were crosschecked by posing selected questions to neighbour farmers the questionnaire used for the 2 surveys was structured as follows note that some questions applied only to inactive or active centre pivots identification person interviewed social

qualitative narrative interpretation was used for analysing the self knowledge of the students who formed the research team the knowledge they gained from their parents during the research the information gathered through the spontaneous interviews during the preliminary approach and the information that emerged from the focus group with settlers and agraer staff quantitative analysis consisted of a one way analysis of variance anova used to determine whether the means of yields or irrigation intensities of two or more groups were different using f tests to statistically test the equality of means snedecor and cochran 1980 anova was carried out using the data analysis toolpak of microsoft excel 3 results 3 1 the process of abandoning irrigation in 2001 all 85 centre pivots were under operation 58 in itamarati i and 27 still under the administration of the itamarati farm fig 2 in 2004 the rest of the itamarati farm became itamarati ii unfortunately 22 out of the 27 centre pivots transferred to itamarati ii were vandalised with only 5 remaining operational since then the total number of centre pivots in operation reduced dramatically in 2014 only 20 centre pivots were working and this number was halved by 2020 fig 2 the itamarati ii irrigated area over the originally irrigable one was small from the beginning 0 19 and it decreased to the current fraction of 0 11 table 2 the evolution of irrigation intensity varied between social groups fafi has kept the 2 centre pivots allocated at the creation of the settlement nowadays cut and fetagri are the two groups with the strongest irrigation intensity table 2 note that the abandonment of irrigation does not mean abandonment of agriculture the entire irrigable area is cultivated as being rainfed 3 2 irrigation equipment and management all pumps were of centrifugal type most of them manufactured in germany by ksb se co models wkl 150 2 or 150 3 with impellers of 350 mm the power of the pump motors was 250 kw 64 of the pumps surveyed or 300 kw 28 their flow rate varied from 300 to 350 m³ h 1 and their hydraulic head between 100 and 150 m the diameter of the conveyance pipes varied from 250 to 300 mm and their length from 1000 to 2300 m the typical lateral length was of 600 m covering 113 ha the most common emitters were of the spray type manufactured by fabrimar rio de janeiro brazil the hydraulic head at the entrance of the lateral was around 50 m the common irrigation practice is to run the centre pivot after five to eight days about one week without rain regardless of the cropping pattern 82 of the centre pivots surveyed were operated at 50 of full speed the outer tower moving at a speed of 132 m h 1 taking 55 65 h to complete the 360º rotation and applying about 15 mm of water per irrigation in order to minimize the energy cost irrigation is done preferably from 21 00 06 00 and avoiding the period between 17 00 and 21 00 this irrigation practice implies that generally farmers do not aim to meet the full crop water requirements however none of the farmers surveyed used soil water sensors or meteorological information to schedule irrigation despite there being a weather station located at 45 km from irsis whose data are publicly available through internet 3 3 understanding the irrigation abandonment process centre pivot breakdowns reported were electrical hydraulic and mechanical ones the former was the main cause of failure fig 3 22 electrical faults had already been reported in 2004 this number increasing to 65 in 2016 and 76 in 2016 fig 3 the amount of hydraulic failures mainly related to the motor pump with many years of use and little or no maintenance and mechanical breakdowns related to the centre pivot wheels and tyres also increased during the period of study fig 3 maintenance was limited to corrective and emergency measures no preventive maintenance was carried out one of the cooperatives installed in irsis employs two electricians who work on demand for farmers when their centre pivots need repairing theft and vandalism were at the root of most of the important irrigation system breakdowns thefts included electrical wiring transformers command boxes electric motors tyres plumbing sprinklers etc with copper being removed from control panels and transformers the elements most targeted by thieves only in 2013 approximately 36 thefts were reported during our 2014 and 2016 visits we witnessed the results of vandalism that had just occurred in 4 centre pivots vandalism was more serious in itamarati ii where only 4 of the original 23 centre pivots remained in operation the average yield of irrigated crops reported in the surveys was 3400 kg ha 1 and 5000 kg ha 1 for soybean and maize respectively however high variability between settler groups was observed with average yields varying from 2700 to 4080 kg ha 1 fig 4a and from 4200 to 7800 kg ha 1 fig 4b for soybean and maize respectively average yield of irrigated crops was less than 10 greater than that of rainfed crops fig 4ab a difference that was not statistically significant p 0 05 and came below expectations economic analyses carried out by richetti et al 2015a 2015b fixed the break even yield of irrigated crops at 3360 kg ha 1 and 7200 kg ha 1 for soybean and maize respectively thus only 64 and 22 of the soybean and maize irrigated crops achieved yields that covered production costs contrary to the crop performance under irrigation more than 90 of the rainfed soybean crops achieved higher yields than the break even yield fig 4a and 80 obtained higher yields than the average for state of mato grosso do sul 2800 kg ha 1 famasul 2019 rainfed maize did not perform so well fig 4b note that maize in irsis and the mato grosso do sul state is a secondary crop in relation to soybean 3 4 social settings and self organization the creation of irsis involved the participation of various public institutions university land reform and extension agencies research organizations and social movements which established the two development plans for irsis these plans emphasized the need for strengthening the farmers organizations necessary for the collective management of shared centre pivots and professional training of farmers who had little or no previous experience in irrigation technologies and agribusiness urchei et al 2002 incra seprod idaterra 2003 incra fcr 2006 the development plans also highlighted the importance of the collaboration with research training and technology transfer and advisory agencies and companies to intensify crop production and introduce high value crops such as vegetables and fruit trees therefore our survey aimed to find out if the planned actions required for collective work were actually implemented in irsis regarding farmers organization the surveys indicated that the majority of farmers 81 of those interviewed were dissatisfied with the collective management of shared centre pivots their reasons for dissatisfaction and the percentage of farmers giving their reasons were high operational and maintenance cost of the irrigation equipment 55 high frequency of thefts and vandalism of expensive equipment 58 lack of specialized assistance 60 weak commitment of farmers to their communities 40 and difficulties in financing collective actions farmers in irsis have access to subsidized credits from a public bank however banks do not consider a settlers group as legal entities so farmers prefer to apply for the credit individually over time the little satisfaction in collective work contributed to changes in the management of the shared centre pivots fig 5 the planned model of collective farming model a remained in some centre pivots whereas it evolved towards alternative managerial models in others thus the current models include a collective farming this original model remains in 10 of the currently active centre pivots the owners decide on the cropping pattern collectively so the centre pivot is actually a single management unit fig 6a farmers sharing the centre pivot also share the production costs and benefits the centre pivot land is usually irrigated as a whole or left to be rainfed if irrigated one member of the group is entrusted with the operation and maintenance of the irrigation equipment and the same member or another one acts as treasurer to collect irrigation fees to pay for the operational and maintenance costs b collective leasing this management model applies to 80 of the currently active centre pivots in which the tenant decides on the cropping patterns thus the field arrangement is similar to case a the tenant covers all the cultivation and irrigation costs assumes the cultivation risks and pays a rent usually 900 1000 kg ha 1 of soybean per year to the collective owner again the centre pivot land is irrigated as a whole or left to be rainfed if irrigated the operation and maintenance of the centre pivot is the responsibility of the tenant the tenant is normally one farmer 42 or a small group of 2 4 farmers 23 who may or not be members of the settlers group the satisfaction with renting is high around 75 among settlers who rent their collective areas fig 5 they argued that it reduces risk and that they can use their time for other activities to obtain extra income around 57 of farmers interviewed earned extra incomes by working outside the settlement or concentrating their work on their individual rainfed plots c individual farming each farmer decides individually on the cropping pattern for his her circle sector so that multiple crops or those under different management cover the centre pivot area fig 6b each farmer decides whether to irrigate or not pumping is turned off while the centre pivot passes over non irrigated sectors the farmers who irrigate share the cost sometimes farmers who do not irrigate do have to contribute to the irrigation equipment maintenance cost one farmer from the group is usually in charge of the operation and maintenance of the irrigation equipment and acts as treasurer d mixed individual and collective farming the pivot area is partly cultivated collectively model a and partly individually model c this management model normally arises when there is no agreement between the members of the group in this case the decisions cropping pattern water management assignation of responsibilities and distribution of operation and maintenance costs are imprecise soybean yield did not differ significantly according to the management model p 0 05 fig 7a maize yield under managerial model a was significantly higher than under the other models p 0 05 fig 7b although this difference was due to the exceptionally good performance of rainfed maize grown by the amffi social group however our survey showed that there is a high rate of members 50 in the managerial models a c and d who do not pay their fees regularly fee defaulting prevents proper maintenance and delays the payment of energy bills we hypothesized that the heterogeneity of the social group running the centre pivots could explain part of the patterns observed aggarwal 2000 theesfeld 2004 fafi and amffi could be considered to be homogeneous groups since they originated from former workers and residents from itamarati farm respectively on the contrary cut featgri and mst were considered as being heterogeneous groups since the majority of their members came from different places without previous experience in agriculture however our data did not support the hypothesis of a group homogeneity heterogeneity effect first the percentage of dissatisfaction with the collective management of shared pivots was very similar 73 and 75 in the homogeneous and heterogeneous groups respectively resulting in the same percentage of collective leasing around 55 in both types of groups second we did not observe any homogeneity effect on the number of active pivots in fact the drop in the number of active pivots between 2014 and 2016 was more notable in the more homogeneous group than in the less homogeneous one fig 8 third the mean soybean yield was significantly lower p 0 05 in the homogeneous groups than in the heterogeneous ones 14 and 23 in irrigated and rainfed respectively fig 9a while the mean maize yield under irrigation was similar in both groups p 0 05 and in rainfed was significantly higher p 0 05 in the heterogeneous groups than in the homogeneous ones fig 9b regarding technical assistance farmers complained about its lack especially of public assistance only 34 of the farmers interviewed declared that they receive some type of technical assistance mostly from private companies that supply agricultural inputs or from technicians who are members of the farmers groups farmers complained about the limited service offered by agraer the public assistance agency with an office in irsis centenaro and tavares 2017 also reported farmers dissatisfaction with public technical assistance from irsis the agraer team in irsis is composed of only one agronomist and two agricultural technicians to assist two thousand farmers and none of them are specialists in irrigation in fact only 10 of the farmers seek assistance from agraer mainly to help them with bureaucratic procedures e g applying for credit technical assistance varied between social groups in mst and cut only 8 and 12 5 respectively of farmers received support the highest percentage nearly 70 and 100 was observed in fetagri and fafi respectively several members of fetagri received technical aid from agricultural input suppliers which mainly involved crop protection seeds and fertilization technical assistance did not influence the number of current active pivots since their percentage did not vary significantly between assisted 23 4 actives of 17 pivots and non assisted 21 7 actives of 32 pivots ones on the other hand higher soybean yields were achieved in pivots where farmers received technical assistance compared to unassisted farmers the differences were 15 higher p 0 05 in both irrigated and rainfed crops fig 10 however 66 12 out of 18 of the pivots that obtained higher yields than 3500 kg ha 1 received assistance fig 10 the majority of settler groups 11 of 20 were not associated with any cooperative or association of farmers even though there are five cooperatives operating in irsis no influence of group homogeneity was found on filiations with these cooperatives cooperatives installed in irsis are devoted to post harvest and product commercialization none of them to financing crops or irrigation equipment finally crop diversification has had little success farmers only cultivate the two commodity crops soybean and maize that predominate in the region 4 discussion only 10 of the 63 centre pivots that started to operate in irsis remain active and only one of them has stayed under collective management the conclusion reached has been that the settlement project has failed why and when did the abandonment process start which factors contributed to that process the dramatic decline of active centre pivots during the first years was an indication of faulty planning during the elaboration of the two itamarati development plans settlers were invited to collaborate however they were not encouraged to participate actively terra 2010 moreover the selection of the centre pivot as a collective irrigation system was not an open and participatory decision but the convenience of leveraging irrigation equipment already in place had that not been the case the planners could have selected a different irrigation system criticism of the role of public institutions in the introduction of certain irrigation methods specifically localized irrigation in collective irrigation systems is a topical issue in the scientific literature ortega reig et al 2017 garcía mollá et al 2020 nevertheless some centre pivots continued operating while the abandonment process became gradual during successive years therefore faulty design was not the only determinant in the abandonment process our surveys revealed that the immediate reasons were the economic and technical incapability for preventive and corrective maintenance and to repair damage caused by vandalism maintenance needs were exacerbated by the age of the centre pivot systems older than 30 years thus maintenance was costly and difficult to finance through collective action the consequences are that maintenance has been deferred breakdowns are increasingly frequent the energy efficiency has declined lima et al 2009 and the energy cost has increased subsequently farmers fall into debt with the electricity company which eventually cuts off their supply in addition to the above our research showed a lack of specialized maintenance professionals the current rate of 580 ha per maintenance professional is clearly below the rate of 138 288 ha per maintenance technician recommended by koç 2018 the current state of the centre pivots in irsis points to the need for a rehabilitation project however this would involve an investment ranging from u 90 000 to 220 000 per pivot lima et al 2009 and our interviews clearly revealed that farmers cannot afford this rehabilitation cost in addition the financing programmes available are aimed at purchasing new irrigation systems for individual plots not to rehabilitate collective centre pivots as a result farmers move over to rainfed crop production as individuals or lease their farms collectively to tenants new tenants who can afford the repair costs or pay electricity bills often repair vandalized centre pivots and put them back into production therefore the process discussed above has had two consequences a significant abandonment of irrigation and an increase in the size of the smallholding through leasing as bellé et al 2013 and terra 2010 have already pointed out a similar trend was reported in india by aggrarwal 2000 who analysed the collective action in group owned wells concluding that group members preferred to invest individually despite the advantages of pooling capital and sharing risks these are therefore examples of development through bricolage cleaver 2012 explained by the critical institutional analysis and development framework whaley 2018 an additional factor that explains neglecting irrigation in irsis is that it only slightly improved soybean yield with respect to rainfed cropping 600 kg ha 1 on average 10 and showed little effect on maize yield however the potential of soybean yield increment due to irrigation reported by flumingan et al 2015 and sentelhas et al 2015 is of 2050 kg ha 1 the large yield gap under irrigation observed in irsis could be related to inadequate irrigation management the usual irrigation practice is to apply a 15 mm water depth after one week without rain although urchei et al 2002 recommended frequent applications 2 3 applications per week due to the limited water holding capacity of the ferralsol in irsis that recommendation is in accordance with the weekly water demand of 25 35 mm fietz et al 2001 flumignan et al 2015 the practice of non full irrigation is not necessarily a farmers rational decision the difficulties mentioned in collective action may be one reason for simplifying irrigation decisions another reason could be insufficient technical advice which in our research was found to be a significant determinant of the soybean crop yields indeed other studies terra 2009 bellé et al 2013 centenaro and tavares 2017 also conclude that the most pressing need at irsis is technical assistance due to the settlers farming inexperience during our interviews farmers complained about the lack of public technical assistance and training in addition the technical assistance established at irsis responded to a demand based model according to which farmers require assistance only for the problems that they perceive this model does not favour any improvement in schemes like irsis exploited by inexperienced farmers valdes et al 2004 irrigation advisory services with public support should contribute to better irrigation practices in irsis as has been claimed for other smallholder irrigation schemes in brazil mateos et al 2018 araujo et al 2019 maintenance cost and poor yield are patently evident factors explaining the abandonment of shared centre pivots in irsis however other less tangible ones could be at the root of the process our surveys revealed the feeble commitment of farmers to their communities and a pessimistic attitude towards collective action bellé et al 2013 argued that most social conflicts among farmers in irsis were due to the wide gap in cultural and life experience differences between member groups nevertheless the centre pivots managed by socially homogeneous groups fafi and amffi also manifested similar dissatisfaction with the shared centre pivot notion and showed an equally poor performance to that of the centre pivots managed by socially heterogeneous groups on the other hand irsis farmers were not highly dependent on shared centre pivots because they could achieve productive yields under rainfed conditions lease their plots and or exert other economic activities dependence on irrigation systems is recognized as being one of the key factors for success in water collective action araral 2009 wang et al 2013 takayama et al 2018 in summary in addition to the difficulties for the collective action needed to manage and maintain a shared centre pivot system theesfeld 2004 takayama et al 2018 the cost of irrigation was a major barrier to full adoption of centre pivot technology in irsis cost as a major determinant of irrigation technology adoption has been identified in other countries de witt et al 2021 tesfaye et al 2021 price et al 2022 moreover the weight of biophysical factors such as crop type and weather noted in irsis has been observed also in usa gibson et al 2018 while the lack of an extension service highlighted by irsis farmers has been reported as a barrier to adoption also in australia koech et al 2021 as observed at irsis price et al 2022 showed that the adoption of centre pivot in alabama usa depends on multiple factors operating at multiple levels 5 conclusions the itamarati plans failed they were a paradigm of a top down project in which the participation and capacity of the settlers were disregarded would it have been different if a robust training and technical assistance programme had been implemented there are signs that this would have been a possibility as soybean yields were better when farmers received advice however the conditions for the high level of collective action required by an extremely centralized system such as a shared centre pivot did not exist although the heterogeneity of the groups did not appear to be a determining factor the productive advantage of irrigation was low a timely intervention at the beginning of the abandonment spiral might have helped to overcome some of the barriers inherent to the settlement this intervention should have been oriented towards the empowerment of the settler community its technical training and assistance and the imbuement of a sense of community and an appropriation of the infrastructures that never existed however the progressive abandonment of collective management and the concentration of land in larger farms seems to have been inexorable this case study contains important lessons for policymakers centralized collective systems should not be promoted by public agencies unless the community that adopts them has a high degree of trust and sense of community and that its capacity for collective action is sufficiently robust nevertheless itamarati s experience is unique it does not imply that other experiences of shared centre pivot necessarily fail the impossibility of generalising what was observed in itamarati is the major limitation of this research although as a case study it should serve as an example and guide to identify conditions that can lead to success or failure declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper 
9201,irrigation is essential for sustaining the productivity of plantation forests in arid semi arid and seasonal drought regions current irrigation management is commonly scheduled based on time or soil water status which often fails to capture plant physiological demand here we report on the variation of traits related to plant water use for 7 year old populus tomentosa plantations under different irrigation treatments in north china during two growth seasons with contrasting environmental dryness plant hydraulics were assessed by stomatal regulation strategy as well as hydraulic traits conferring water transport efficiency and safety including branch hydraulic conductivity ks thresholds for xylem embolism px and percentage loss of leaf rehydration capacity plrc leaf water potential at turgor loss point ψtlp as well as hydraulic capacitance before and after turgor loss cbulk pre and cbulk post respectively our results showed that both seasonal increases in rainfall and irrigation could modify stomatal regulation strategy resulting in a more anisohydric stomatal behavior but through different underlying mechanisms specifically seasonal variation in stomatal regulation was primarily manipulated by the daily fluctuation of leaf water potential ψtlp and possibly the water supply demand relationship at the same time we speculated that irrigation dependent alternation was presumably associated with shifted belowground traits seasonal variation in hydraulic traits was found for ks and ψtlp with trees in the dry season displaying higher ks and less negative ψtlp regardless of irrigation while other traits governing hydraulic functioning were essentially invariable across seasons or irrigation treatments tree growth rate was lower in the wet season and was independent of irrigation which was likely explained by the occurrence of hydraulic impairment due to less stringent stomatal control overall our results suggest that limited precipitation and high atmospheric vapor pressure deficit in the dry season would not compromise tree growth because of the tighter stomatal control while hydraulic dysfunction could occur in the wet season due to excessive water use strategy subsequently perhaps contributing to the reduction in growth rate the findings of this study underscore the usefulness of physiological traits in guiding irrigation management and advocate reconsidering plantation water management strategy based on reliable indicators keywords plantation forest water regulation strategy hydraulics populus irrigation

productivity is often highly dependent on environmental water availability liu et al 2020 peltier and ogle 2020 rain fed plantations are often difficult to achieve potential productivity especially in arid and semi arid regions where rainfall is inadequate and often stochastic therefore irrigation is a commonly applied intensive cultivation measure for sustaining and stabilizing biomass accumulation of plantations cai et al 2021 xi et al 2021 he et al 2021 nonetheless irrigation regimes of many plantations need to be appropriately designed mainly because plantation managers need more precise information regarding whether and when irrigation should be implemented xi et al 2021 oliveira et al 2020 espadafor et al 2018 therefore it is crucial to acknowledge the relationship between the irrigation regime and the productivity of plantations xi et al 2021 jiao et al 2021 thereby guiding precise irrigation scheduling that can promote water conservation without sacrificing tree growth while a large body of literature has documented the effects of water availability on forest growth magnin et al 2017 egea et al 2010 including plantations studies focusing on the underlying mechanisms are much less xi et al 2021 water availability affects plant growth primarily through plant physiology henderson and jose 2010 clermont dauphin et al 2013 li et al 2018 plant water relations in particular play a pivotal role in facilitating carbon acquisition and governing the overall response of plants to moisture conditions magnin et al 2017 zhao et al 2021 variations of plant hydraulic processes are often closely linked with water availability and affect plant growth and survival li et al 2018 stomatal regulation among others essentially reflects the balance between carbon acquisition and water conservation and largely determines the gas exchange efficiency of plants anderegg et al 2018b chen et al 2022 venturas et al 2017 species specific stomatal regulation is often categorized using the iso and anisohydric framework meinzer et al 2016 depending on the stomatal dynamics under decreasing moisture conditions plants can either prioritize carbon gain by maintaining stomatal openness but exposed to a higher risk of hydraulic impairment i e anisohydric or ensure the integrity of the water transport system at the expense of carbon acquisition i e isohydric which can have a profound consequence on forest productivity sperry et al 2002 wolf et al 2016 in addition water transport capacity quantified by hydraulic conductivity k dictates the gas exchange rate

choat et al 2012 trueba et al 2019 moreover leaf rehydration capacity which is often assessed using the percentage loss of rehydration capacity plrc reflects the vitality of mesophyll cells thus defining the lower bound for the post drought recovery of leaf metabolic activity johnson et al 2018 trueba et al 2019 together these traits constitute the critical dimension of plant water use strategy therefore determining the response of plants to the fluctuating amount of water a clear understanding of these traits will provide important implications for productivity maintenance and forest management liu et al 2018 zhu et al 2017 optimizing plantation water management also requires irrigation events to be timely scheduled xi et al 2021 volschenk 2020 irrigation timing is of high importance for ensuring the productivity of plantations hubbard et al 2010 especially in regions where the climate is highly seasonal with unevenly distributed precipitation that generates water deficit at varying temporal scales i e seasonal or annual although irrigation is prevailing in plantations the timing decision is empirical primarily to date for example a recent meta analysis shows that irrigation is applied chiefly based on either calendar or fixed time intervals during the annual growth of most poplar plantations xi et al 2021 while in a few cases irrigation is timed according to metrics indicating soil water availability seidel et al 2017 naiem et al 2022 such time or soil centered irrigation scheduling is often difficult to capture the temporal variation of plant water status and demand on the one hand the increased climate variability in the context of global climate change has resulted in highly unpredictable rainfall events rendering time per se a less reliable indicator for the occurrence of water deficit on the other hand it is known that plant and soil water status can be decoupled leading to variation in plant water potential independent of soil moisture conditions shi et al 2015 jones 2006 instead physiological attributes have advantages over these metrics in terms of directly reflecting the water status of plants and are closely linked with plant growth this suggests that a physiology centered approach will be instrumental in refining the irrigation strategy however constituting such a plan is commonly constrained by inadequate knowledge regarding the temporal variation of physiological characteristics and its relationship with plant growth plantation forests are a vital forest type worldwide especially in china food and agriculture organization of the united nations 2020 the latest national forest inventory 2014 2018 shows that the coverage of plantation forests in china has reached ca 80 million ha accounting for 36 5 of the total forest area 220 million ha ranking first in the world national forestry and grassland administration 2019 as one of the main plantation species worldwide poplar populus spp is widely afforested in north china to alleviate the timber shortage and provide multiple ecosystem services because of its rapid growth high timber quality and excellent timber adaptability water availability is the primary determinant of the growth and productivity of poplar plantations tschaplinski et al 1998 xi et al 2021 liu et al 2022 yet both of which are increasingly threatened by water shortage due to global climate change and over exploration of surface as well as underground water resources xi et al 2016 di et al 2019 arend et al 2021 in this context developing precise irrigation regime represents the core of sustainable forest management practice the current study investigated the effects of season and irrigation regime on plant water relations of mature populus tomentosa plantations in north china and associated traits related to plant water use and tree growth measurements were conducted in two seasons characterized by contrasting environmental dryness on trees that were either irrigated or only relied on rain fed the variation of stomatal regulation strategy across the growing seasons and irrigation treatment was assessed under the iso an isohydric framework in addition key hydraulic features were also measured to gain a comprehensive understanding of plant water use strategy we ask whether irrigation will alter the growth of mature trees by influencing water relations specifically we hypothesized that 1 traits related to the water use of p tomentosa will respond to seasonal dryness exhibiting conservative strategy in the dry season and excessive strategy in the wet season which will be translated into slow and fast growth rates respectively 2 irrigation will promote tree growth by modifying traits related to plant water use leading to more excessive water use with the positive effect being more evident in the dry season 2 materials and methods 2 1 site description and irrigation regime the experimental site is located in the state owned

current experiment full drip irrigation fi in which trees were irrigated whenever the soil matric potential dropped to 18 to 20 kpa non irrigation treatment ni in which trees only relied on rainfall these treatments belong to a large scale experiment with randomized block design testing the response of poplar plantations to various irrigation regimes and each treatment consists of five replicated

irrigation was only applied in the dry season and commenced once soil metric water potential dropped below 18 0 kpa in the present study a total of 180 g urea was applied to individual trees in each treatment during the growth season of 2021 to avoid any confounding effects on tree growth due to nutrient limitation wang et al 2015 meteorological variables were continuously monitored using an

hydroscape area to accurately quantify the situ water status of p tomentosa we measured the predawn ψpd mpa and midday leaf water potentials ψmd mpa and maximum daily variation in leaf water potential δψ mpa calculated as ψpd ψmd every 7 10 days during the growing season of 2021 i e april to october for leaf sampling four trees were selected in each treatment and 5 6 sample leaves were randomly excised from the upper middle and lower canopies of these trees leaf samples were immediately sealed in ziplock bags humidified by exhaling and were quickly stored in an opaque box filled with ice to maintain the moisture in leaves then transported back to the laboratory within 1 hr for water potential determination leaf water potential ψl mpa was measured using a scholander type pressure chamber

quantify the degree of isohydricity and it has been shown as a robust metric for describing stomatal regulation across a wide range of species li et al 2019 meinzer et al 2016 klein 2014 furthermore leaf minimum water potential ψlmin mpa was defined as the most negative ψmd recorded during the growth season 2 4 pressure volume analysis leaf pressure volume curve pv measurements were made in mid

a small portion ca 0 5 cm of petiole being submerged in distilled water for rehydration in darkness at room temperature ca 25 for up to 3 hrs following rehydration leaf samples were quickly bolted dry to remove residual water and weighed with a digital microbalance 0 0001 g to obtain water saturated fresh mass single leaf area was obtained by a scanner epson twain pro perfection v800 afterward all

repeated until leaf water potential reached ca 4 0 mpa leaf samples were then dried at 70 c for 72 hrs until constant to obtain dry weight to calculate leaf relative water content rwc the relationship

approximately 1 5 2 5 m long branches at three canopy layers were sampled from 5 to 6 randomly selected individual trees in each treatment using a tree pruner in total 15 18 branch samples were collected for each treatment these branches were placed in a bucket filled with distilled water and were recut at approximately 30 cm above the cut surface underwater to expose functional vessels branches were immediately transported to the laboratory with the cut end being maintained under water and placed in darkness for rehydration during rehydration ψl was measured periodically to assess the water status of the branch assuming equilibrium in water potential across organs for non transpiring samples nolf et al 2015 rodriguez dominguez et al 2022 branches were considered well rehydrated when ψl 0 5 mpa thereafter the whole branch was placed in a black plastic bag containing a wet towel to dehydrate branch vulnerability curves vc were determined using the bench dehydration method chen et al 2021 in short 3 5 leaves were excised from the branch every 1 hr during dehydration for water potential assessment and branch water potential was estimated using the average ψl as a proxy shoot embolism level was determined during dehydration at approximately 0 5 mpa intervals once the target water potential was reached 3 4 current year shoot segments about 10 15 cm in length were excised from the branch underwater following the procedure of wheeler et al 2013 the shoot segments were then attached to a custom made device to determine the flow rate at low pressure generated gravimetrically 3 kpa the shoot sample was then flushed at 150 kpa for 10 15 min with 2 mm kcl solution to remove any possible embolism then the flow rate of the segment was measured again measured flow rates with fully rehydrated were normalized by sample length sapwood area and pressure gradient to obtain branch specific hydraulic conductivity ks kg m 1 s 1 mpa 1 percentage loss of hydraulic

curves branches were collected in mid may and mid july and rehydrated with the same protocol used for vulnerability curve measurement the plrc was generated following the protocol introduced by john et al 2018 in brief following rehydration approximately 10 mature and fully expanded leaves were selected and cut off from each branch within each treatment leaves were immediately weighed to obtain water saturated fresh weight fwsat g and were then labeled and benchtop dried at room temperature during dehydration leaves were randomly selected for weighting the dehydrated weight fwdehy g and then allowed for rehydration by submerging the cut surface of the petiole under water for at least 8 hrs fresh mass after rehydration fwrehy g was then determined and leaf samples were oven dried at 70 c

the overlap of 95 confidence interval li et al 2018 note that although irrigation was stopped for fi in the wet season owing to the plenty of rainfall the difference in soil water content between treatments remained significant fig 1d this reflected the legacy effect of applying irrigation in the dry season data were tested for normality as well as equity and were log transformed if necessary before performing statistical analysis the difference in data between seasons or irrigation treatments were compared using the pairwise and independent t test with the t test function respectively statistical significance was considered when p 0 05 all data analyses were conducted in r 4 1 3 r development core team 2014 3 results 3 1 meteorological and soil moisture conditions a total of 292 mm irrigation amount in fi and 789 mm precipitation were recorded throughout the growing season of 2021 with about 90 702 mm of the precipitation concentrating after june 27 fig 1 a therefore we defined june 27 as the demarcation of the dry and wet seasons in 2021 there were significant differences in both mean rh and ta between the dry 69 7 21 0 c and wet 81 7 23 2 c seasons p 0 001 fig 1b additionally both vpd and rs exhibited an obviously seasonal variation pattern with the average daily vpd and rs in the dry season 0 9 kpa 14 7 mj m 2 day 1 being significantly higher than that in the wet season 0 4 kpa 11 5 mj m 2 day 1 p 0 001 fig 1 c irrigation had a pronounced effect on soil water availability in the deep soil layer of 1 6 m the swc in fi always kept distinctly higher than that in ni even during the wet season when irrigation in fi ceased fig 1d after averaging the data over the whole growing season it was found that fi had 6 5 higher swc in deep soil than ni p 0 001 for the 0 1 m shallow soil layer there was also a noticeable difference in swc between treatments during the dry season with the swc in fi being 8 5 higher relative to that in ni p 0 001 fig 1d however this difference decreased considerably in the wet season but the swc was still consistently higher in fi p 0 001 fig 1d 3 2 dynamics of leaf water potential during the dry season predawn leaf water potential ranged between 0 92 to 0 11 mpa and 0 75 to 0 10 mpa for ni and fi treatments respectively fig 2 while the variation of midday leaf water potential during this period followed the same pattern with the recovery lagging behind the restoration of ψpd fig 2 on the other hand the ψmd continuously decreased i e more negative from the onset of the wet season until the occurrence of the first significant rainfall event such reduction in ψmd led to a significant increase in δψ during the same period 1 14 and 1 18 mpa for ni and fi treatment respectively p 0 001 fig 2 although the ψpd remained high fig 2 there was no significant difference in both ψpd and ψmd between the two irrigation treatments during the experimental period p 0 87 and 0 98 for ψpd and ψmd respectively fig 2 across seasons the average ψpd of the two treatments was slightly lower i e more negative in the dry season 0 36 mpa than in the wet season 0 28 mpa p 0 20 in contrast the average ψmd was more negative in the wet season 1 32 and 1 56 mpa in the dry season and wet season respectively p 0 05 fig 2 tree stomatal regulation strategy quantified by the hsa varied across seasons and irrigation treatments fig 3 trees generally exhibited higher hsa in the wet season fig 3b d compared with the dry season fig 3a c regardless of the irrigation treatment while within the same growing period irrigated trees fig 3c d showed higher hsa than rain fed trees fig 3a b 3 3 variation of hydraulic traits across seasons and irrigation treatments the ψtlp varied greatly between seasons with its value being significantly lower in the wet season 2 18 mpa than in the dry season 1 69 mpa p 0 001 yet no difference was found between treatments p 0 56 fig 2 tables 1 2 likewise the ψos was also unchanged by irrigation p 0 82 there was a tendency that ψos was more negative in the wet season yet this difference was not statistically significant p 0 21 leaf hydraulic capacitance before loss of turgor cbulk pre was significantly higher in the wet season p 0 02 while there was a significant interactive effect of irrigation treatment and season on leaf hydraulic capacitance after turgor loss cbulk post p 0 02 tables 1 2 moreover trees in all treatments had significantly higher ks in the dry season p 0 001 but this trait did not differ across irrigation treatments p 0 36 tables 1 2 both season and irrigation treatment had no effect on branch xylem embolism thresholds including px12 and px50 fig 4 table s1 different degrees of px values showed opposite trends in the two treatments that is the px12 value of the fi treatment was lower more negative than that of the ni treatment but the px50 value of the ni treatment was lower than that of the fi treatment fig 4 table s1 in addition trees in the dry season showed significant but slightly higher leaf resistance to vitality loss as evidenced by the lower rwc values triggering a 10 loss of rehydration capacity plrc10 yet no such difference was found for rwc inducing a 50 loss of rehydration capacity plrc50 fig 5 table s1 on the other hand no difference was found in both plcr10 and plcr50 across irrigation treatments 3 4 effects of season and irrigation on biomass accumulation rate biomass accumulation rate kg month 1 lai 1 tree 1 significantly differed across seasons with the growth rates of both aboveground and underground parts being nearly two times higher in the dry season than in the wet season p 0 001 however no difference in growth rate was found between irrigation treatments p 0 83 and 0 21 for above and belowground biomass respectively which phenomenon existed in both seasons i e no interaction effect between season and irrigation treatment p 0 40 and 0 77 for above and belowground biomass respectively fig 6 4 discussion we investigated stomatal regulation strategy under the iso anisohydry framework with the stringency of stomatal control being quantified by the hydroscape area and assessed multiple hydraulic traits related to water transport and drought tolerance as well as tree growth for p tomentosa plantation under different irrigation regimes in two growth seasons characterized by contrasting rainfall our results showed that both seasonal rainfall and irrigation could result in more anisohydric stomatal behavior nonetheless it appears that irrigation had limited ability to modify tree hydraulics with most measured hydraulic traits only showing seasonal variation or unchanged across either season or irrigation treatment unexpectedly the tree growth rate was faster in the dry season and was unaffected by irrigation overall our findings suggest that irrigation has little effect on sustaining the growth of mature p tomentosa plantations by mitigating water limitation even in the dry season with little precipitation these results provide valuable implications for the intensive management of poplar plantations in this region 4 1 seasonality of stomatal regulation strategy and hydraulics traits the impacts of environmental moisture conditions on tree water relations have been extensively studied chen et al 2015 liu et al 2018 li et al 2021 yet few studies have focused on its seasonality under field conditions wang et al 2022 chen et al 2015 here we quantified the stomatal regulation strategy using the hsa which has been suggested as a robust metric describing the response of stomata to water availability and integrating multiple hydraulic traits álvarez maldini et al 2021 hochberg et al 2017 ratzmann et al 2019a we found that p tomentosa tended to exhibit a relatively isohydric strategy in the dry season and more anisohydric strategy in the wet season fig 3 therefore suggesting a plastic stomatal behavior in this species this is inconsistent with the findings of li et al 2018 who showed that hsa is genetically determined across a wide range of species however our finding is in line with a number of studies showing that hsa can vary in response to water availability being more anisohydric under ample moisture conditions but isohydric when soil water availability is limited guo and ogle 2019 thus highlighting the role of hydro environment in shaping species stomatal behavior li et al 2021 despite the plasticity the hsa values recorded from p tomentosa are within the first quartile of hsa variation for temperate species at the global scale fu and meinzer 2019 hence indicating a high stomatal sensitivity to environmental dryness of this species mathematically the hsa is determined by two aspects the variation of water potential under well hydrated conditions and the point at which ψpd and ψmd converge which usually occurs at complete stomatal closure and is governed by drought tolerance traits li et al 2019 in the current study the variation of hsa across seasons was primarily driven by the altered δψ given that steady state water flows in the aboveground portion of vascular plants can be described as vpd gs δψ ks hv li et al 2019 hochberg et al 2017 thus δψ will be positively correlated with vpd and gs and negatively related to ks and hv huber value however the observed increased δψ and in turn hsa in the wet season cannot be explained by vpd as vpd of the wet season was significantly lower than that of the dry season fig 1 it is likely that the variation in δψ can be in part explained by gs given that previous studies performed in this plantation have shown that trees tended to exhibit higher gs in the wet season which would increase the difference between ψpd and ψmd li et al 2022 additionally the increase in δψ during the wet season can be due in part to the decreased ks table 2 fig 2 on the other hand although branch level hv was not recorded our growth measurement indicates that the hv at the whole tree level as represented by the ratio of trunk basal area to leaf area index was significantly higher in wet season data not shown which should lead to decreased δψ contrary to the observation of current study furthermore traits indicating embolism resistance i e px or rehydration capacity i e plrc50 were invariable across the season thus did not contribute to the variation in hsa however an increased i e more negative ψtlp which is often considered as a proxy of stomatal closure and has been shown to be associated with hsa leuschner et al 2022 ding et al 2014 thom et al 2022 was detected in the wet season such alternation can further enlarge hsa by allowing more negative ψmd at any given ψpd although convergence in ψpd and ψmd was not recorded during the growth season interestingly ψtlp is reportedly more negative in the dry season for field grown plants lenz et al 2006 blackman 2018 which is opposite to the findings of present study given the increased amount of precipitation in the wet season the upregulated ψtlp was unlikely to reflect an active osmotic regulation in response to water stress rather the higher ψtlp in the wet season may arise because of the accumulation of sugar due to shifted carbon source sink strength i e photosynthesis vs growth see section 4 3 4 2 irrigation modifies stomatal regulation but not hydraulic traits we hypothesized that irrigation would alter water relations such that trees would show more excessive water use even in the dry season this expectation is partially supported by the observation that hsa was generally higher for irrigated trees but the effect of water supplement on hsa was more evident in the wet season relative to the dry season fig 3 the variation of hsa following irrigation adds further evidence for the plasticity of stomatal regulation in p tomentosa unlike the variation of hsa across seasons however neither ψtlp nor δψ can explain the more anisohydric behavior in irrigated trees given that these variables did not differ across irrigation treatments moreover other measured aboveground hydraulic traits were also largely unchanged by irrigation therefore cannot be related to varied figs 3 4 table 2 alternatively it appears that applying irrigation may affect tree stomatal regulation strategy by modifying belowground traits indeed the belowground hydraulic process has also been suggested as the bottleneck of water transport manipulating the whole tree level response to water availability maurel and nacry 2020 aravena et al 2014 in support jiang et al 2020 reported that the degree of isohydry is predominantly governed by the water acquisition facilitated by the deep roots system in a number of understory shrubs i e increased utilization of deep water resources through upregulated root hydraulic conductivity will promote an isohydric stomatal behavior and vice versa our previous studies have shown that the trees in ni have more deep roots xi et al 2021 liu et al 2022 zou et al 2022 therefore in our experimental stand compared with the irrigated trees rain fed individuals could acquire more water from deeper soil layers given that soil water content was consistently low at both shallow and deep layers without irrigation consequently leading to a more isohydric strategy we did not measure root traits in the present work however our previous studies have demonstrated that root morphology did not respond to irrigation zou et al 2022 thus it is possible that root hydraulic traits were affected by irrigation resulting in more water consumption in the deep soil layer in non irrigated trees despite similar rooting depth further study incorporating both above and belowground traits under different irrigation treatments will help to fully elucidate the mechanisms underlying the control over water use in this species 4 3 the relationship between growth and water relations intuitively anisohydric stomatal regulation strategy prioritizes leaf gas exchange over hydraulic safety thus would benefit carbon assimilation and in turn productivity this notion is supported by some experimental evidence for instance attia et al 2015 found that hybrid poplar characterized by anisohydric stomatal regulation shows significantly higher growth rate under well water conditions similarly guo and ogle 2019 reported that high biomass accumulation rates correspond to periods with anisohydric strategy in larrea tridentata accordingly we expected that trees would show a higher growth rate when stomatal control over gas exchange is less stringent i e in the wet season and under irrigation conditions in contrast to our expectation the growth rate was much lower in the wet season and irrigation showed no effect on growth fig 6 despite the observed anisohydric behavior under these conditions fig 3 thus suggesting a decoupling between stomatal regulation and biomass accumulation it could be argued that the potential effects of irrigation and therefore stomatal regulation strategy could be overridden by other factors limiting tree growth indeed it has been demonstrated that poplar growth is closely associated with a number of climatic factors including temperature radiation or vapor pressure deficit which vary seasonally and potentially constrain tree growth canete salinas et al 2019 niemczyk et al 2018 nonetheless all these factors during our experimental period were within the range that promoting rapid tree growth according to the empirical relationship between climatic factors and p tomentosa growth rate established in our previous work li et al 2020 therefore it is unlikely that tree growth was limited by these environmental factors in the current study furthermore it is also possible that the seasonal variation of tree growth represents the effect of phenology rather than the shifted tree water relation in the current study we normalized the growth rate using the leaf area index to minimize the impacts of phenology on tree growth still it can be difficult to fully factor out the effects of phenology on declined tree growth in the wet season given the nature of field study nonetheless our findings point to the role of tree hydraulic in rendering decreased growth rate during late growth stage an implicit assumption underpinning the correlation between stomatal regulation strategy and growth is the limitation of photosynthesis by the efficiency of leaf gas exchange which is often determined by water supply veenendaal et al 2008 ratzmann et al 2019b fu et al 2019 wang et al 2021 as opposed to our hypothesis the anisohydric stomatal regulation may have caused a lower growth rate in the wet season fig 6 we found that leaf water potential continued to decrease from the onset of the wet season following the discontinuation of irrigation which can be partially attributed to the excessive stomatal regulation ultimately reaching ca 2 2 mpa prior to the arrival of first significant precipitation event fig 2 the more negative water potential may result in prolonged stomatal closure in spite of the increased leaf resistance to turgor loss moreover although stem water potential was not measured our previous data indicate that the water potential gradient between leaf and stem is small even when water demand for transpiration is high data now shown given that embolism resistance was unaltered across the season fig 4 the more negative water potential experienced in the early phase of the wet season would lead to an increased level of xylem embolism and decreased hydraulic conductivity this could subsequently compromise water transport and leaf gas exchange with the effect possibly lasting until the end of the growing season as embolized vessels usually cannot undergo rapid repairment arend et al 2021 ruehr et al 2019 5 conclusions understanding the relationship between water availability and growth is of high essence for precise irrigation scheduling which is a fundamental aspect of intensive plantation management we measured water relations of p tomentosa treated with different irrigation regimes in two growth seasons characterized by contrasting precipitation with the aim of informing irrigation practice based on the variation of tree hydraulic traits our results showed that increased soil water availability either due to irrigation or rainfall enables trees to adopt a more anisohydric stomatal regulation strategy nonetheless the altered stomatal regulation strategy across seasons could be attributed to the change in the water supply demand relationship as well as leaf dehydration resistance while irrigation may change the stomatal behavior by modifying root traits yet the excessive stomatal behavior did not benefit tree growth but can possibly resulted in decreased growth by inducing more negative water potential and thus higher level of hydraulic impairment these results can be informative in guiding the irrigation management for poplar plantations at the experimental site irrigation is conventionally scheduled only during the dry season because of limited precipitation and high atmospheric vapor pressure deficit however the lower soil water content due to the absence of irrigation does not necessarily affect tree water status given that excessive water loss can be largely prevented by tighter stomatal control moreover increased soil water may offer no benefit to tree growth ultimately leading to reduced water use efficiency therefore the necessity of long term irrigation during the dry season in other words applying dry season irrigation in mature poplar plantations should be reconsidered on the other hand trees may occasionally experience more negative water potentials in the wet season because of the loose stomatal control over water loss therefore irrigation could be occasionally applied especially before the occurrence of a significant rainfall event thereby minimizing the risk of permanent hydraulic dysfunction which can often result in a long lasting negative effect on water transport gas exchange and stand productivity one limitation of this study is that data were gained from a single year experiment therefore it remains unclear if the pattern of physiology and growth observed here can be extended to the whole rotation period which should be thoroughly addressed in future studies nonetheless the findings of this study provide implications for the irrigation management in aged plantations of p tomentosa and other poplar species

9201,irrigation is essential for sustaining the productivity of plantation forests in arid semi arid and seasonal drought regions current irrigation management is commonly scheduled based on time or soil water status which often fails to capture plant physiological demand here we report on the variation of traits related to plant water use for 7 year old populus tomentosa plantations under different irrigation treatments in north china during two growth seasons with contrasting environmental dryness plant hydraulics were assessed by stomatal regulation strategy as well as hydraulic traits conferring water transport efficiency and safety including branch hydraulic conductivity ks thresholds for xylem embolism px and percentage loss of leaf rehydration capacity plrc leaf water potential at turgor loss point ψtlp as well as hydraulic capacitance before and after turgor loss cbulk pre and cbulk post respectively our results showed that both seasonal increases in rainfall and irrigation could modify stomatal regulation strategy resulting in a more anisohydric stomatal behavior but through different underlying mechanisms specifically seasonal variation in stomatal regulation was primarily manipulated by the daily fluctuation of leaf water potential ψtlp and possibly the water supply demand relationship at the same time we speculated that irrigation dependent alternation was presumably associated with shifted belowground traits seasonal variation in hydraulic traits was found for ks and ψtlp with trees in the dry season displaying higher ks and less negative ψtlp regardless of irrigation while other traits governing hydraulic functioning were essentially invariable across seasons or irrigation treatments tree growth rate was lower in the wet season and was independent of irrigation which was likely explained by the occurrence of hydraulic impairment due to less stringent stomatal control overall our results suggest that limited precipitation and high atmospheric vapor pressure deficit in the dry season would not compromise tree growth because of the tighter stomatal control while hydraulic dysfunction could occur in the wet season due to excessive water use strategy subsequently perhaps contributing to the reduction in growth rate the findings of this study underscore the usefulness of physiological traits in guiding irrigation management and advocate reconsidering plantation water management strategy based on reliable indicators keywords plantation forest water regulation strategy hydraulics populus irrigation

functioning of forest ecosystems by compromising plant growth or even threatening survival brodribb et al 2021 choat et al 2018 forest ecosystems exert a strong mitigating effect on the climate and offer various social and economic benefits bonan 2008 alkama et al 2022 hammond et al 2022 plantation forests account for a small fraction of global forest cover but hold great importance in providing additional ecosystem service restoring ecosystem structure and function and buffering climate change through carbon sequestration fao international poplar commission 2016 kumar et al 2020 however many plantation forests are particularly vulnerable to water deficit because tree species or clones for establishing plantations are often mainly selected for productivity with less focus on resistance kumar et al 2020 anderegg et al 2018a in addition reduced biodiversity due to limited species and monotonic age structure add additional vulnerability to disturbance grossiord 2020 understanding how plantation forests respond to water availability will help to ensure the sustainability of the forestry economy and alleviate the negative effects of climate change on plantation functions forest productivity is often highly dependent on environmental water availability liu et al 2020 peltier and ogle 2020 rain fed plantations are often difficult to achieve potential productivity especially in arid and semi arid regions where rainfall is inadequate and often stochastic therefore irrigation is a commonly applied intensive cultivation measure for sustaining and stabilizing biomass accumulation of plantations cai et al 2021 xi et al 2021 he et al 2021 nonetheless irrigation regimes of many plantations need to be appropriately designed mainly because plantation managers need more precise information regarding whether and when irrigation should be implemented xi et al 2021 oliveira et al 2020 espadafor et al 2018 therefore it is crucial to acknowledge the relationship between the irrigation regime and the productivity of plantations xi et al 2021 jiao et al 2021 thereby guiding precise irrigation scheduling that can promote water conservation without sacrificing tree growth while a large body of literature has documented the effects of water availability on forest growth magnin et al 2017 egea et al 2010 including plantations studies focusing on the underlying mechanisms are much less xi et al 2021 water availability affects plant growth primarily through plant physiology henderson and jose 2010 clermont dauphin et al 2013 li et al 2018 plant water relations in particular play a pivotal role in facilitating carbon acquisition and governing the overall response of plants to moisture conditions magnin et al 2017 zhao et al 2021 variations of plant hydraulic processes are often closely linked with water availability and affect plant growth and survival li et al 2018 stomatal regulation among others essentially reflects the balance between carbon acquisition and water conservation and largely determines the gas exchange efficiency of plants anderegg et al 2018b chen et al 2022 venturas et al 2017 species specific stomatal regulation is often categorized using the iso and anisohydric framework meinzer et al 2016 depending on the stomatal dynamics under decreasing moisture conditions plants can either prioritize carbon gain by maintaining stomatal openness but exposed to a higher risk of hydraulic impairment i e anisohydric or ensure the integrity of the water transport system at the expense of carbon acquisition i e isohydric which can have a profound consequence on forest productivity sperry et al 2002 wolf et al 2016 in addition water transport capacity quantified by hydraulic conductivity k dictates the gas exchange rate because leaves need to be well hydrated to maintain stomatal openness brodribb and field 2000 maherali et al 2008 on the other hand the leaf turgor loss point ψtlp represented by the water potential at which cell turgor is complete loss and embolism resistance that is quantified by the water potential inducing 50 loss of hydraulic conductivity p50 collectively defined the ability to maintain stomata open metabolic activity and water sufficiency when soil moisture is limited hence setting thresholds for plant carbon acquisition development and survival blackman et al 2018 li et al 2019 choat et al 2012 trueba et al 2019 moreover leaf rehydration capacity which is often assessed using the percentage loss of rehydration capacity plrc reflects the vitality of mesophyll cells thus defining the lower bound for the post drought recovery of leaf metabolic activity johnson et al 2018 trueba et al 2019 together these traits constitute the critical dimension of plant water use strategy therefore determining the response of plants to the fluctuating amount of water a clear understanding of these traits will provide important implications for productivity maintenance and forest management liu et al 2018 zhu et al 2017 optimizing plantation water management also requires irrigation events to be timely scheduled xi et al 2021 volschenk 2020 irrigation timing is of high importance for ensuring the productivity of plantations hubbard et al 2010 especially in regions where the climate is highly seasonal with unevenly distributed precipitation that generates water deficit at varying temporal scales i e seasonal or annual although irrigation is prevailing in plantations the timing decision is empirical primarily to date for example a recent meta analysis shows that irrigation is applied chiefly based on either calendar or fixed time intervals during the annual growth of most poplar plantations xi et al 2021 while in a few cases irrigation is timed according to metrics indicating soil water availability seidel et al 2017 naiem et al 2022 such time or soil centered irrigation scheduling is often difficult to capture the temporal variation of plant water status and demand on the one hand the increased climate variability in the context of global climate change has resulted in highly unpredictable rainfall events rendering time per se a less reliable indicator for the occurrence of water deficit on the other hand it is known that plant and soil water status can be decoupled leading to variation in plant water potential independent of soil moisture conditions shi et al 2015 jones 2006 instead physiological attributes have advantages over these metrics in terms of directly reflecting the water status of plants and are closely linked with plant growth this suggests that a physiology centered approach will be instrumental in refining the irrigation strategy however constituting such a plan is commonly constrained by inadequate knowledge regarding the temporal variation of physiological characteristics and its relationship with plant growth plantation forests are a vital forest type worldwide especially in china food and agriculture organization of the united nations 2020 the latest national forest inventory 2014 2018 shows that the coverage of plantation forests in china has reached ca 80 million ha accounting for 36 5 of the

primary determinant of the growth and productivity of poplar plantations tschaplinski et al 1998 xi et al 2021 liu et al 2022 yet both of which are increasingly threatened by water shortage due to global climate change and over exploration of surface as well as underground water resources xi et al 2016 di et al 2019 arend et al 2021 in this context developing precise irrigation regime represents the core of sustainable forest management practice the current study investigated the effects of season and irrigation regime on plant water relations of mature populus tomentosa plantations in north china and associated traits related to plant water use and tree growth measurements were conducted in two seasons characterized by contrasting environmental dryness on trees that were either irrigated or only relied on rain fed the variation of stomatal regulation strategy across the growing seasons and irrigation treatment was assessed under the iso an isohydric framework in addition key hydraulic features were also measured to gain a comprehensive understanding of plant water use strategy we ask whether irrigation will alter the growth of mature trees by influencing water relations specifically we hypothesized that 1 traits related to the water use of p tomentosa will respond to seasonal dryness exhibiting conservative strategy in the dry season and excessive strategy in the wet season which will be translated into slow and fast growth rates respectively 2 irrigation will promote tree growth by modifying traits related to plant water use leading to more excessive water use with the positive effect being more evident in the dry season 2 materials and methods 2 1 site description and irrigation regime the experimental site is located in the state owned

trees ha 1 at the time of plantation establishment the average height and diameter at breast height dbh of trees were 3 0 0 1 m and 3 7 0 2 cm respectively we designed two irrigation treatments in the current experiment full drip irrigation fi in which trees were irrigated whenever the soil matric potential dropped to 18 to 20 kpa non irrigation treatment ni in which trees only relied on rainfall these treatments belong to a large scale experiment with randomized block design testing the response of poplar plantations to various irrigation regimes and each treatment consists of five replicated plots the microenvironments including slope elevation and soil profile were largely identical across plots to implement the irrigation treatment a high precision irrigation system netafim co ltd israel was laid out in the field with soil matric water potential being monitored using tensiometers installed at 10 cm depth and 15 cm from the dripper yang et al 2019 during the experimental year irrigation was only applied in the dry season and commenced once soil metric water potential dropped below 18 0 kpa in the present study a total of 180 g urea was applied to individual trees in each treatment during the growth season of 2021 to avoid any confounding effects on tree growth due to nutrient limitation wang et al 2015 meteorological variables were continuously monitored using an

hydroscape area to accurately quantify the situ water status of p tomentosa we measured the predawn ψpd mpa and midday leaf water potentials ψmd mpa and maximum daily variation in leaf water potential δψ mpa calculated as ψpd ψmd every 7 10 days during the growing season of 2021 i e april to october for leaf sampling four trees were selected in each treatment and 5 6 sample leaves were randomly excised from the upper middle and lower canopies of these trees leaf samples were immediately sealed in ziplock bags humidified by exhaling and were quickly stored in an opaque box filled with ice to maintain the moisture in leaves then transported back to the laboratory within 1 hr for water potential determination leaf water potential ψl mpa was measured using a scholander type pressure chamber skpm1400 skye instruments ltd llandrindod wells uk the device s chamber was humidified using a moist paper towel to minimize additional leaf water loss during measurement rodriguez dominguez et al 2022 the obtained ψpd were plotted against ψmd for each irrigation treatment and season which were used to calculate the hydroscape area hsa mpa2 following johnson et al 2018 the hsa can be used to quantify the degree of isohydricity and it has been shown as a robust metric for describing stomatal regulation across a wide range of species li et al 2019 meinzer et al 2016 klein 2014 furthermore leaf minimum water potential ψlmin mpa was defined as the most negative ψmd recorded during the growth season 2 4 pressure volume analysis leaf pressure volume curve pv measurements were made in mid may i e dry season and mid july i e wet season of 2021 as to each treatment four sample trees were selected and three to four leaves were randomly collected from three canopy layers i e upper middle

a small portion ca 0 5 cm of petiole being submerged in distilled water for rehydration in darkness at room temperature ca 25 for up to 3 hrs following rehydration leaf samples were quickly bolted dry to remove residual water and weighed with a digital microbalance 0 0001 g to obtain water saturated fresh mass single leaf area was obtained by a scanner epson twain pro perfection v800 afterward all leaves were placed in an opaque box and moisturized with a wet paper towel to dehydrate slowly during dehydration leaf water potential and fresh mass were determined periodically measurements were repeated until leaf water potential reached ca 4 0 mpa leaf samples were then dried at 70 c for 72 hrs until constant to obtain dry weight to calculate leaf relative water content rwc the relationship

approximately 1 5 2 5 m long branches at three canopy layers were sampled from 5 to 6 randomly selected individual trees in each treatment using a tree pruner in total 15 18 branch samples were collected for each treatment these branches were placed in a bucket filled with distilled water and were recut at approximately 30 cm above the cut surface underwater to expose functional vessels branches were immediately transported to the laboratory with the cut end being maintained under water and placed in darkness for rehydration during rehydration ψl was measured periodically to assess the water status of the branch assuming equilibrium in water potential across organs for non transpiring samples nolf et al 2015 rodriguez dominguez et al 2022 branches were considered well rehydrated when ψl 0 5 mpa thereafter the whole branch was placed in a black plastic bag containing a wet towel to dehydrate branch vulnerability curves vc were determined using the bench dehydration method chen et al 2021 in short 3 5 leaves were excised from the branch every 1 hr during dehydration for water potential assessment and branch water potential was estimated using the average ψl as a proxy shoot embolism level was determined during dehydration at approximately 0 5 mpa intervals once the target water potential was reached 3 4 current year shoot segments about 10 15 cm in length were excised from the branch underwater following the procedure of wheeler et al 2013 the shoot segments were then attached to a custom made device to determine the flow rate at low pressure generated gravimetrically 3 kpa the shoot sample was then flushed at 150 kpa for 10 15 min with 2 mm kcl solution to remove any possible embolism then the flow rate of the segment was measured again measured flow rates with fully rehydrated were normalized by sample length sapwood area and pressure gradient to obtain branch specific hydraulic conductivity ks kg m 1 s 1 mpa 1 percentage loss of hydraulic conductivity plc at specific water potential was calculated as 2 plc 100 1 k pre k post where kpre and kpost are the ks values before and after the flush respectively branch xylem vulnerability curves were constructed by plotting water potential against corresponding plc 2 6 rehydration capacity leaf rehydration capacity was determined by measuring the percentage loss of rehydration capacity plrc curves branches were collected in mid may and mid july and rehydrated with the same protocol used for vulnerability curve measurement the plrc was generated following the protocol introduced by john et al 2018 in brief following rehydration approximately 10 mature and fully expanded leaves were selected and cut off from each branch within each treatment leaves were immediately weighed to obtain water saturated fresh weight fwsat g and were then labeled and benchtop dried at room temperature during dehydration leaves were randomly selected for weighting the dehydrated weight fwdehy g and then allowed for rehydration by submerging the cut surface of the petiole under water for at least 8 hrs fresh mass after rehydration fwrehy g was then determined and leaf samples were oven dried at 70 c for 72 hrs until constant to obtain dry weight dw g for each leaf sample plrc was calculated as 3 plrc 100 1 lwc re h y lwc sat where lwcrehy and lwcsat are the water contents g g 1 of the rehydrated

and irrigation treatment on plant hydraulic traits by applying the lm function and anova function of the car package except for traits extracted from vc and plrc curves which were compared based on the overlap of 95 confidence interval li et al 2018 note that although irrigation was stopped for fi in the wet season owing to the plenty of rainfall the difference in soil water content between treatments remained significant fig 1d this reflected the legacy effect of applying irrigation in the dry season data were tested for normality as well as equity and were log transformed if necessary before performing statistical analysis the difference in data between seasons or irrigation treatments were compared using the pairwise and independent t test with the t test function respectively statistical significance was considered when p 0 05 all data analyses were conducted in r 4 1 3 r development core team 2014 3 results 3 1 meteorological and soil moisture conditions a total of 292 mm irrigation amount in fi and 789 mm precipitation were recorded throughout the growing season of 2021 with about 90 702 mm of the precipitation concentrating after june 27 fig 1 a therefore we defined june 27 as the demarcation of the dry and wet seasons in 2021 there were significant differences in both mean rh and ta between the dry 69 7 21 0 c and wet 81 7 23 2 c seasons p 0 001 fig 1b additionally both vpd and rs exhibited an obviously seasonal variation pattern with the average daily vpd and rs in the dry season 0 9 kpa 14 7 mj m 2 day 1 being significantly higher than that in the wet season 0 4 kpa 11 5 mj m 2 day 1 p 0 001 fig 1 c irrigation had a pronounced effect on soil water availability in the deep soil layer of 1 6 m the swc in fi always kept distinctly higher than that in ni even during the wet season when irrigation in fi ceased fig 1d after averaging the data over the whole growing season it was found that fi had 6 5 higher swc in deep soil than ni p 0 001 for the 0 1 m shallow soil layer there was also a noticeable difference in swc between treatments during the dry season with the swc in fi being 8 5 higher relative to that in ni p 0 001 fig 1d however this difference decreased considerably in the wet season but the swc was still consistently higher in fi p 0 001 fig 1d 3 2 dynamics of leaf water potential during the dry season predawn leaf water potential ranged between 0 92 to 0 11 mpa and 0 75 to 0 10 mpa for ni and fi treatments respectively fig 2 while the variation of midday leaf water potential during this period followed the same pattern with the recovery lagging behind the restoration of ψpd fig 2 on the other hand the ψmd continuously decreased i e more negative from the onset of the wet season until the occurrence of the first significant rainfall event such reduction in ψmd led to a significant increase in δψ during the same period 1 14 and 1 18 mpa for ni and fi treatment respectively p 0 001 fig 2 although the ψpd remained high fig 2 there was no significant difference in both ψpd and ψmd between the two irrigation treatments during the experimental period p 0 87 and 0 98 for ψpd and ψmd respectively fig 2 across seasons the average ψpd of the two treatments was slightly lower i e more negative in the dry season 0 36 mpa than in the wet season 0 28 mpa p 0 20 in contrast the average ψmd was more negative in the wet season 1 32 and 1 56 mpa in the dry season and wet season respectively p 0 05 fig 2 tree stomatal regulation strategy quantified by the hsa varied across seasons and irrigation treatments fig 3 trees generally exhibited higher hsa in the wet season fig 3b d compared with the dry season fig 3a c regardless of the irrigation treatment while within the same growing period irrigated trees fig 3c d showed higher hsa than rain fed trees fig 3a b 3 3 variation of hydraulic traits across seasons and irrigation treatments the ψtlp varied greatly between seasons with its value being significantly lower in the wet season 2 18 mpa than in the dry season 1 69 mpa p 0 001 yet no difference was found between treatments p 0 56 fig 2 tables 1 2 likewise the ψos was also unchanged by irrigation p 0 82 there was a tendency that ψos was more negative in the wet season yet this difference was not statistically significant p 0 21 leaf hydraulic capacitance before loss of turgor cbulk pre was significantly higher in the wet season p 0 02 while there was a significant interactive effect of irrigation treatment and season on leaf hydraulic capacitance after turgor loss cbulk post p 0 02 tables 1 2 moreover trees in all treatments had significantly higher ks in the dry season p 0 001 but this trait did not differ across irrigation treatments p 0 36 tables 1 2 both season and irrigation treatment had no effect on branch xylem embolism thresholds including px12 and px50 fig 4 table s1 different degrees of px values showed opposite trends in the two treatments that is the px12 value of the fi treatment was lower more negative than that of the ni treatment but the px50 value of the ni treatment was lower than that of the fi treatment fig 4 table s1 in addition trees in the dry season showed significant but slightly higher leaf resistance to vitality loss as evidenced by the lower rwc values triggering a 10 loss of rehydration capacity plrc10 yet no such difference was found for rwc inducing a 50 loss of rehydration capacity plrc50 fig 5 table s1 on the other hand no difference was found in both plcr10 and plcr50 across irrigation treatments 3 4 effects of season and irrigation on biomass accumulation rate biomass accumulation rate kg month 1 lai 1 tree 1 significantly differed across seasons with the growth rates of both aboveground and underground parts being nearly two times higher in the dry season than in the wet season p 0 001 however no difference in growth rate was found between irrigation treatments p 0 83 and 0 21 for above and belowground biomass respectively which phenomenon existed in both seasons i e no interaction effect between season and irrigation treatment p 0 40 and 0 77 for above and belowground biomass respectively fig 6 4 discussion we investigated stomatal regulation strategy under the iso anisohydry framework with the stringency of stomatal control being quantified by the hydroscape area and assessed multiple hydraulic traits related to water transport and drought tolerance as well as tree growth for p tomentosa plantation under different irrigation regimes in two growth seasons characterized by contrasting rainfall our results showed that both seasonal rainfall and irrigation could result in more anisohydric stomatal behavior nonetheless it appears that irrigation had limited ability to modify tree hydraulics with most measured hydraulic traits only showing seasonal variation or unchanged across either season or irrigation treatment unexpectedly the tree growth rate was faster in the dry season and was unaffected by irrigation overall our findings suggest that irrigation has little effect on sustaining the growth of mature p tomentosa plantations by mitigating water limitation even in the dry season with little precipitation these results provide valuable implications for the intensive management of poplar plantations in this region 4 1 seasonality of stomatal regulation strategy and hydraulics traits the impacts of environmental moisture conditions on tree water relations have been extensively studied chen et al 2015 liu et al 2018 li et al 2021 yet few studies have focused on its seasonality under field conditions wang et al 2022 chen et al 2015 here we quantified the stomatal regulation strategy using the hsa which has been suggested as a robust metric describing the response of stomata to water availability and integrating multiple hydraulic traits álvarez maldini et al 2021 hochberg et al 2017 ratzmann et al 2019a we found that p tomentosa tended to exhibit a relatively isohydric strategy in the dry season and more anisohydric strategy in the wet season fig 3 therefore suggesting a plastic stomatal behavior in this species this is inconsistent with the findings of li et al 2018 who showed that hsa is genetically determined across a wide range of species however our finding is in line with a number of studies showing that hsa can vary in response to water availability being more anisohydric under ample moisture conditions but isohydric when soil water availability is limited guo and ogle 2019 thus highlighting the role of hydro environment in shaping species stomatal behavior li et al 2021 despite the plasticity the hsa values recorded from p tomentosa are within the first quartile of hsa variation for temperate species at the global scale fu and meinzer 2019 hence indicating a high stomatal sensitivity to environmental dryness of this species mathematically the hsa is determined by two aspects the variation of water potential under well hydrated conditions and the point at which ψpd and ψmd converge which usually occurs at complete stomatal closure and is governed by drought tolerance traits li et al 2019 in the current study the variation of hsa across seasons was primarily driven by the altered δψ given that steady state water flows in the aboveground portion of vascular plants can be described as vpd gs δψ ks hv li et al 2019 hochberg et al 2017 thus δψ will be positively correlated with vpd and gs and negatively related to ks and hv huber value however the observed increased δψ and in turn hsa in the wet season cannot be explained by vpd as vpd of the wet season was significantly lower than that of the dry season fig 1 it is likely that the variation in δψ can be in part explained by gs given that previous studies performed in this plantation have shown that trees tended to exhibit higher gs in the wet season which would increase the difference between ψpd and ψmd li et al 2022 additionally the increase in δψ during the wet season can be due in part to the decreased ks table 2 fig 2 on the other hand although branch level hv was not recorded our growth measurement indicates that the hv at the whole tree level as represented by the ratio of trunk basal area to leaf area index was significantly higher in wet season data not shown which should lead to decreased δψ contrary to the observation of current study furthermore traits indicating embolism resistance i e px or rehydration capacity i e plrc50 were invariable across the season thus did not contribute to the variation in hsa however an increased i e more negative ψtlp which is often considered as a proxy of stomatal closure and has been shown to be associated with hsa leuschner et al 2022 ding et al 2014 thom et al 2022 was detected in the wet season such alternation can further enlarge hsa by allowing more negative ψmd at any given ψpd although convergence in ψpd and ψmd was not recorded during the growth season interestingly ψtlp is reportedly more negative in the dry season for field grown plants lenz et al 2006 blackman 2018 which is opposite to the findings of present study given the increased amount of precipitation in the wet season the upregulated ψtlp was unlikely to reflect an active osmotic regulation in response to water stress rather the higher ψtlp in the wet season may arise because of the accumulation of sugar due to shifted carbon source sink strength i e photosynthesis vs growth see section 4 3 4 2 irrigation modifies stomatal regulation but not hydraulic traits we hypothesized that irrigation would alter water relations such that trees would show more excessive water use even in the dry season this expectation is partially supported by the observation that hsa was generally higher for irrigated trees but the effect of water supplement on hsa was more evident in the wet season relative to the dry season fig 3 the variation of hsa following irrigation adds further evidence for the plasticity of stomatal regulation in p tomentosa unlike the variation of hsa across seasons however neither ψtlp nor δψ can explain the more anisohydric behavior in irrigated trees given that these variables did not differ across irrigation treatments moreover other measured aboveground hydraulic traits were also largely unchanged by irrigation therefore cannot be related to varied figs 3 4 table 2 alternatively it appears that applying irrigation may affect tree stomatal regulation strategy by modifying belowground traits indeed the belowground hydraulic process has also been suggested as the bottleneck of water transport manipulating the whole tree level response to water availability maurel and nacry 2020 aravena et al 2014 in support jiang et al 2020 reported that the degree of isohydry is predominantly governed by the water acquisition facilitated by the deep roots system in a number of understory shrubs i e increased utilization of deep water resources through upregulated root hydraulic conductivity will promote an isohydric stomatal behavior and vice versa our previous studies have shown that the trees in ni have more deep roots xi et al 2021 liu et al 2022 zou et al 2022 therefore in our experimental stand compared with the irrigated trees rain fed individuals could acquire more water from deeper soil layers given that soil water content was consistently low at both shallow and deep layers without irrigation consequently leading to a more isohydric strategy we did not measure root traits in the present work however our previous studies have demonstrated that root morphology did not respond to irrigation zou et al 2022 thus it is possible that root hydraulic traits were affected by irrigation resulting in more water consumption in the deep soil layer in non irrigated trees despite similar rooting depth further study incorporating both above and belowground traits under different irrigation treatments will help to fully elucidate the mechanisms underlying the control over water use in this species 4 3 the relationship between growth and water relations intuitively anisohydric stomatal regulation strategy prioritizes leaf gas exchange over hydraulic safety thus would benefit carbon assimilation and in turn productivity this notion is supported by some experimental evidence for instance attia et al 2015 found that hybrid poplar characterized by anisohydric stomatal regulation shows significantly higher growth rate under well water conditions similarly guo and ogle 2019 reported that high biomass accumulation rates correspond to periods with anisohydric strategy in larrea tridentata accordingly we expected that trees would show a higher growth rate when stomatal control over gas exchange is less stringent i e in the wet season and under irrigation conditions in contrast to our expectation the growth rate was much lower in the wet season and irrigation showed no effect on growth fig 6 despite the observed anisohydric behavior under these conditions fig 3 thus suggesting a decoupling between stomatal regulation and biomass accumulation it could be argued that the potential effects of irrigation and therefore stomatal regulation strategy could be overridden by other factors limiting tree growth indeed it has been demonstrated that poplar growth is closely associated with a number of climatic factors including temperature radiation or vapor pressure deficit which vary seasonally and potentially constrain tree growth canete salinas et al 2019 niemczyk et al 2018 nonetheless all these factors during our experimental period were within the range that promoting rapid tree growth according to the empirical relationship between climatic factors and p tomentosa growth rate established in our previous work li et al 2020 therefore it is unlikely that tree growth was limited by these environmental factors in the current study furthermore it is also possible that the seasonal variation of tree growth represents the effect of phenology rather than the shifted tree water relation in the current study we normalized the growth rate using the leaf area index to minimize the impacts of phenology on tree growth still it can be difficult to fully factor out the effects of phenology on declined tree growth in the wet season given the nature of field study nonetheless our findings point to the role of tree hydraulic in rendering decreased growth rate during late growth stage an implicit assumption underpinning the correlation between stomatal regulation strategy and growth is the limitation of photosynthesis by the efficiency of leaf gas exchange which is often determined by water supply veenendaal et al 2008 ratzmann et al 2019b fu et al 2019 wang et al 2021 as opposed to our hypothesis the anisohydric stomatal regulation may have caused a lower growth rate in the wet season fig 6 we found that leaf water potential continued to decrease from the onset of the wet season following the discontinuation of irrigation which can be partially attributed to the excessive stomatal regulation ultimately reaching ca 2 2 mpa prior to the arrival of first significant precipitation event fig 2 the more negative water potential may result in prolonged stomatal closure in spite of the increased leaf resistance to turgor loss moreover although stem water potential was not measured our previous data indicate that the water potential gradient between leaf and stem is small even when water demand for transpiration is high data now shown given that embolism resistance was unaltered across the season fig 4 the more negative water potential experienced in the early phase of the wet season would lead to an increased level of xylem embolism and decreased hydraulic conductivity this could subsequently compromise water transport and leaf gas exchange with the effect possibly lasting until the end of the growing season as embolized vessels usually cannot undergo rapid repairment arend et al 2021 ruehr et al 2019 5 conclusions understanding the relationship between water availability and growth is of high essence for precise irrigation scheduling which is a fundamental aspect of intensive plantation management we measured water relations of p tomentosa treated with different irrigation regimes in two growth seasons characterized by contrasting precipitation with the aim of informing irrigation practice based on the variation of tree hydraulic traits our results showed that increased soil water availability either due to irrigation or rainfall enables trees to adopt a more anisohydric stomatal regulation strategy nonetheless the altered stomatal regulation strategy across seasons could be attributed to the change in the water supply demand relationship as well as leaf dehydration resistance while irrigation may change the stomatal behavior by modifying root traits yet the excessive stomatal behavior did not benefit tree growth but can possibly resulted in decreased growth by inducing more negative water potential and thus higher level of hydraulic impairment these results can be informative in guiding the irrigation management for poplar plantations at the experimental site irrigation is conventionally scheduled only during the dry season because of limited precipitation and high atmospheric vapor pressure deficit however the lower soil water content due to the absence of irrigation does not necessarily affect tree water status given that excessive water loss can be largely prevented by tighter stomatal control moreover increased soil water may offer no benefit to tree growth ultimately leading to reduced water use efficiency therefore the necessity of long term irrigation during the dry season in other words applying dry season irrigation in mature poplar plantations should be reconsidered on the other hand trees may occasionally experience more negative water potentials in the wet season because of the loose stomatal control over water loss therefore irrigation could be occasionally applied especially before the occurrence of a significant rainfall event thereby minimizing the risk of permanent hydraulic dysfunction which can often result in a long lasting negative effect on water transport gas exchange and stand productivity one limitation of this study is that data were gained from a single year experiment therefore it remains unclear if the pattern of physiology and growth observed here can be extended to the whole rotation period which should be thoroughly addressed in future studies nonetheless the findings of this study provide implications for the irrigation management in aged plantations of p tomentosa and other poplar species

9202,sensitivity analysis sa is used to identify the effects of crop model input parameters on model results previous studies have indicated that the ceres maize model was difficult to calibrate under the different water stress conditions a genetic parameters time series sensitivity analysis is needed to guide parameter optimization the objectives of this study were to i comprehensively quantify the genetic parameters in ceres maize based on the extended fourier amplitude sensitivity test the sensitivity of ceres maize output variables was analyzed under different water stress conditions ii determine the sensitivities of output variables to genetic parameters during the growth period the results demonstrated that output variable sensitivity varied in response to different water stress conditions the total sensitivity index tsi and time dependent tsi of crop parameters were more sensitive than the first sensitivity index fosi and time dependent fosi of crop genetic parameters the sensitivities of two years 2013 and 2014 based on fosi and time series fosi were consistent some differences existed between simulations based on tsi and time series tsi under different water management conditions the sensitivity of phyllochron interval phint to biomass decreased earlier and faster when drought occurred in the early growth period d1 and d2 the time series of sensitivity index was consistent with the ck treatment when drought happened in the later growth periods d3 and d2 the two parameters of phint and thermal time from emergence to end of juvenile p1 were most sensitive to leaf area index lai when drought occurred in the early growth periods d1 and d2 in addition to phint and p1 other parameters also had sensitivities for lai when drought occurred in later growth periods d3 and d4 future studies should focus on the response of dynamic output variable to soil parameters and weather conditions over the growing season in order to calibrate and apply the ceres maize model keywords dssat model maize crop genetic parameters global sensitivity analysis time series crop yield biomass lai efast method data availability the authors do not have permission to share data 1 introduction crop models are essential tools for ecological agronomic and environmental research and for crop management such models are used to simulate the behavior of soil crop systems that respond to the climate and agricultural management jones et al 2003 these models are helpful in understanding interactions between crops and the environment and are beneficial for predicting crop growth status and estimating crop yield attia et al 2016 dokoohaki et al 2015 fakhr et al 2012 zhang 2012 crop models are mathematical representations of agricultural processes based on theory and empirical research their equations and parameterizations inevitably entail assumptions and simplifications of reality and they lead to uncertainty and inaccuracy of output variables he et al 2016 jiang et al 2011 liang et al 2017 song et al 2014 yao et al 2015 crop models often contain many parameters with considerable uncertainties that can cause uncertainty in predictions dejonge et al 2012 jin et al 2018 liang et al 2017 zhang 2012 parameter sensitivity plays an important guiding role in model calibration therefore model calibration is necessary model calibration can also help users understand the internal mechanisms and processes of the crop model better sensitivity analysis sa allows for qualitative or quantitative estimation of the effects of input parameters on the model output variables jones et al 2012 pianosi et al 2016 pogson et al 2012 zhang et al 2018 by analyzing the results of the sensitivity analysis sa the user can selectively eliminate insensitive calibration parameters thereby significantly improving the calibration efficiency of the model therefore sa is widely used to guide crop model calibration local sa and global sa are two widely applied techniques in parameter sa local sa concentrates on the primary first order impacts of factors parameters or variables on model outputs vanuytrecht et al 2014 wang et al 2013a it is used to determine the influence of changes in one parameter on a model s output variables while all the other parameters are set to arbitrary values local sa only considers one parameter s effect on the output variables and it is well suited for linear and near linear models but is unsuitable for non linear models global sa assumes that all of the parameters vary within the defined range of the input variables it aims to assign all of the output variables uncertainty to the input variables uncertainty li et al 2019 wang et al 2013b the global sa method fully considers parameter interactions and non linear responses however it spends more time calculating the variation ranges of all parameters several global sa methods have been developed including the morris method morris 1991 sobol method sobol 1993 2001 fourier amplitude sensitivity test fast cukier et al 1978 and extended fast efast saltelli et al 1999 in the morris method factors are arranged based on the order of their importance so this method cannot be used to quantify the effect of each factor on output variables variance based methods analyze the effects of each parameter and interactions among different parameters some scientists have used global sa methods to research crop growth models he et al 2016 sobol 1993 dejonge et al 2012 studied the variation and differences in the sensitivity of maize parameters under water deficit and water sufficiency wang et al 2021 studied the sensitivity of maize parameters under different irrigation and fertilization conditions previous studies concluded that the sensitivity of parameters would vary under different management the ceres maize model can simulate daily crop growth process attia et al 2016 dokoohaki et al 2015 song et al 2015 different management methods will inevitably affect the simulation process as a crop environment genotype interaction system the results of crop models and the sensitivity of crop genetic parameters will not remain unchanged throughout the growth period the tolerance of crops to water stress varies with the phenological period the occurrence of water stress also affects crop growth and yield formation song et al 2016 showed that the ceres maize model had high simulation accuracy when drought occurred in a later growth period however when drought occurred at the seedling and jointing stages especially the jointing stage accuracy was low it can be seen that the drought duration and degree have a significant influence on the simulation accuracy of the ceres maize model the advance in drought duration and the aggravation of drought degree can reduce model simulation accuracy dejonge et al 2012 showed that crop model parameter sensitivity was different under different irrigation conditions under different irrigation methods the model parameters had little difference in the phenological period but greatly influenced yield and leaf area index the sensitivity of crop cultivar parameters increased more under complete irrigation conditions than under limited irrigation conditions therefore it is essential to analyze the sensitivity of crop model parameters during the entire growth period under different water stress conditions for calibration of crop model parameters in addition few studies had conducted a global sa based on the efast method for the ceres maize model under different water management conditions there have been few reports regarding global sas based on time series output variable sensitivity during different crop growth periods cukier et al 1978 stella et al 2014 therefore the objectives of this study were as follows i based on the efast method we comprehensively identified the effects of parameter variation on the sensitivity of ceres maize output variables anthesis maturity yield dry biomass and lai under different irrigation conditions ii we studied the time series changes in parameter sensitivity under different irrigation conditions iii different conditions lead to different conclusions from sa and the results will provide suggestions for using the ceres maize model to simulate maize growth and development under different conditions 2 material and methods 2 1 site and experiment description from june to october 2013 and june to october 2014 field trials were conducted at the water saving irrigation experimental station 34 17 n 108 04 e 506 m above sea level of northwest a f university of yangling shaanxi song et al 2016 at the experimental site the frost free period for the entire year is 221 days the average annual rainfall from june to september is 337 mm song et al 2016 the average bulk density of the 0 100 cm soil layer is 1 31 g cm 3 and the water holding capacity and wilting water content of the field are 0 26 cm3 cm 3 and 0 12 cm3 cm 3 respectively the ph of the 0 20 cm soil layer is 8 14 the organic carbon content is 8 20 g kg 1 and the total nitrogen content is 0 62 g kg 1 in the experimental plot the planted area was 8 m2 there was a 1 5 m deep polyethylene plastic isolation layer between the districts that prevented side seepage there was a moveable rain shelter in the test area and the shelter could be closed during rainfall to prevent the impact of natural rainfall on the test results before beginning the experiment the soil water content of the 0 100 cm soil layer in each plot was measured the initial moisture content of the soil was also determined by the layered soil drying method before planting to ensure the same initial water content in each plot the plot with the highest water content among all plots was targeted for irrigation the summer maize variety used in the experiment was zheng dan 958 the field was furrowed and seeded manually the direction of the ditches was east to west the distance between each maize plant was 30 cm and the distance between each row was 50 cm the planting depth was 5 cm and there were four rows in each small area there were 13 plants in each row before planting we applied fertilizer at the rate of 210 kg n hm 2 and 160 kg p2o5 hm 2 in 2013 plots were planted on june 12 and harvested on october 7 in 2014 plots were planted on june 12 and harvested on october 7 we considered two factors irrigation volume and drought stage according to the historical rainfall during the maize growing season we established two irrigation levels 280 mm low water annual growth period rainfall and 440 mm high water annual growth period rainfall we divided the total irrigation amounts into four uniform applications resulting in two irrigation water levels 70 mm and 110 mm designated as i1and i2 the entire maize growing season was divided into four main growth stages seedling emergence jointing heading and filling drought occurred in a single growth stage there were four different drought situations d1 d4 therefore there were eight treatments in this experiment table 1 with each treatment replicated three times in addition we established a control treatment ck that was irrigated with 110 mm at each growth stage the irrigation applied to each plot was recorded and water was manually applied evenly to each zone the meteorological data needed for the model were from the yangling meteorological station located about 100 m away from the experimental site observation data included daily maximum temperature minimum temperature precipitation and sunshine hours 2 2 description of the dssat model dssat decision support system for agrotechnology transfer is one of the most widely used crop model systems jones et al 2003 dssat can simulate the growth and development of daily crops and calculate the impact of various factors on crop yield fakhr et al 2012 huffman et al 2015 liu et al 2010 yao ning et al 2015 therefore dssat can be used for different research objects and purposes the ceres maize model is a sub model of the dssat 4 6 series model that simulates the growth and development of maize the model considers climate soil variety fertilizer and other effects on maize growth the potential production of maize can be calculated from the effective photosynthetically active radiation intercepted from the crop canopy the actual biomass can be calculated by temperature water and nitrogen stress factors shrestha et al 2013 the ceres maize model has been widely used in agricultural research regarding maize this model can accurately simulate maize yield and nitrogen uptake under sprinkler irrigation conditions precise simulation results were obtained in southern canada by simulating maize yield and soil nitrogen dynamics he et al 2016 also used the ceres maize model to simulate the growth of sweet maize in florida usa and they used the model to develop the optimal management measures for water and fertilizer in china previous research related to the ceres maize model has included many areas such as determination and validation of maize genetic parameters effects of different planting periods and irrigation on spring maize yield assessment of climate change on agricultural benefits determination of crop irrigation water requirements prediction of different crop growth conditions and sensitivity analysis of crop parameters li et al 2019 song et al 2015 thus the ceres maize model has become a powerful tool for studying the worldwide maize growth environment according to previous studies the ceres maize model can accurately simulate maize leaf area index lai yield biomass and soil water content under full water conditions however in the case of water deficits the simulation of lai aboveground biomass and yield has been wholly underestimated that is the quantitative description of the water deficit effects has been inaccurate in arid and semi arid regions the ceres maize model was not accurate enough to simulate the growth and development of maize under water deficit conditions song et al 2016 yao et al 2016 in the case of insufficient irrigation the improvement of simulation accuracy of the model still needs further study and parameter sensitivity analysis can provide a basis and reference for parameter optimization in particular sensitivity analysis of crop parameters in time series can help to improve the simulation accuracy of time series variables 2 3 input and output parameters ceres maize input parameters can affect crop growth table 2 song et al 2016 this study analyzed the sensitivity of crop variety parameters p1 p2 p5 g2 g3 and phint random values for each parameter were determined assuming a uniform distribution between the lower and upper bounds table 1 dejonge et al 2012 jin et al 2018 according to song s study song et al 2016 upper and lower limits for cultivar parameters were generally determined the parameter ranges varied up or down by 50 depending on the estimated parameters table 2 model phenophase outputs included anthesis day and maturity day after planting aday and mday respectively crop growth outputs included tops weight at maturity and maximum leaf area index biomass and laix respectively and the most crucial evaluation output was crop yield yield this study used two years 2013 2014 of data from a summer maize water limited experiment using the ceres maize model two kinds of output time series outputs daily biomass leaf area index and annual outputs anthesis maturity biomass yield maximum lai combined with simlab sensitivity analysis software tarantola and becker 2017 the sensitivity of parameters was analyzed by the efast method andarzian et al 2011 wang et al 2018 2 4 efast method the efast method is a global sensitivity analysis method based on variance decomposition it combines the advantages of sobol s method and the fourier amplitude sensitivity method fast he et al 2015 song et al 2014 xing et al 2017 in this method the model s output is analyzed by fourier transform and the spectrum curve of the fourier series is obtained the variance of model results caused by the interaction of each parameter is obtained by the spectrum curve the interaction between the parameters produces the total variance of the model the most crucial feature of efast is the reduction in computational load time of the computer by sampling the parameters through the search function the efast method is a quantitative evaluation method used for uncertainty analysis it has a broad scope of study and high accuracy the analysis results are based on a large number of parameter sampling that can give the relative sensitivity between parameters and quantitatively calculate the contribution rate of each parameter to the variance of model results 3 results 3 1 impacts of water stress at different growth stages on first order sensitivity index and total sensitivity index the efast method calculated the first order sensitivity index fosi and total sensitivity index tsi of anthesis maturity yield biomass and maximum lai the fosi and tsi of the five outputs are shown in fig 1 the results for anthesis maturity yield biomass and maximum lai all showed that the importance of crop parameters based on fosi and tsi was related to different years of meteorological data and water treatments sensitivity index values range from 0 to 1 the closer the value to 1 the more influential the respective parameters is a value greater than 0 05 indicates significant parameter sensitivity in 2013 p1 was the parameter with the greatest sensitivity index for anthesis fig 1 a phint was second fig 1 a in 2014 the sensitivity index of phint became greater in the i1d1 treatment fig 1 a and the parameters interaction became significant in the i2d1 treatment fig 1 u the sensitivity of the parameter in the other treatments remained the same as in 2013 among all treatments in 2013 maturity was the most sensitive to p5 followed by p1 and phint fig 1 b all three parameters showed a great tsi and g2 had strong interactions with the other parameters the sensitivity indices of the parameters differed less between treatments in 2014 the most sensitive parameter was phint in treatment i1d1 fig 1 b the most sensitive parameter was p1 in treatment i2d1 fig 1 v and two parameters p5 and g2 showed a strong interaction in the other treatments p5 and p1 were sensitive parameters for biomass p1 and phint were more sensitive in d1 treatment i1d1 fig 1 c and i2d1 fig 1 w in 2013 for d2 treatment i1d2 fig 1 h and i2d2 fig 1 bb the most sensitive parameter was p1 with p5 being the next most sensitive input parameter for d3 treatment i1d3 fig 1 m and i2d3 fig 1 gg all six parameters showed sensitivity with four parameters p1 p5 g3 and phint being more sensitive than the other parameters the d4 treatment i1d4 fig 1 r and i2d4 fig 1 ii showed great sensitivity index values for all parameters except for p2 which exhibited a less sensitive index p1 was the most sensitive parameter the parameter sensitivity for the ck treatment fig 1 qq was similar to that of the d4 treatment with p1 being the most sensitive parameter and p5 being the next most sensitive parameter the sensitivity of p2 to yield was not significant in both 2013 and 2014 in d1 fig 1 d x and d2 fig 1 i cc treatments in 2013 the number of sensitive parameters was fewer only p1 and p5 while in d3 fig 1 n hh and d4 fig 1 s mm treatments all parameters except p2 had high tsi in 2014 compared with 2013 the number of sensitive parameters increased three parameters p1 p5 and phint were sensitive in the d1 treatment fig 1 d x with phint being the most sensitive in the d2 treatment fig 1 i cc p5 was the most sensitive parameter and in the d3 treatment all parameters showed a strong interaction in i1d3 fig 1 n where the largest tsi was g3 and the largest fosi was phint in i2d3 fig 1 hh the largest tsi was p5 and the largest fosi parameter was p1 the d4 treatment fig 1 s mm showed the largest tsi and fosi for both p1 parameters and ck treatment fig 1 rr showed the largest tsi for p5 and the largest fosi for p1 for maximum lai p1 and phint were the more sensitive parameters while the other parameters were less sensitive the most sensitive parameters differed between treatments with p1 being the most sensitive in the 2013 treatments i1d1 fig 1 e i1d3 fig 1 o i1d4 fig 1 t i2d1 fig 1 y i2d2 fig 1 dd and phint being the most sensitive in the other treatments in 2014 the parameters with the strongest sensitivity were still p1 and phint with phint being the most sensitive in i1d1 fig 1 e and i1d2 fig 1 j and p1 was the most sensitive in the other treatments 3 2 parameter sensitivity for time series output the ceres maize model simulates dynamic changes and the final yield is based on an accurate simulation of output variables that vary over time therefore it was necessary to analyze the sensitivity of ceres maize parameters to two important time varying output variables lai and biomass the results showed slight differences between the fosi and tsi time series figs 2 5 time series for tsi was shown in figs 2 and 4 and time series for fosi was shown in figs 3 and 5 the results of the biomass tsi time series showed that phint was the most sensitive to dry biomass fig 2 in the early part of the growth period phint was more sensitive to biomass than other genetic parameters in the later part of the growing season the p1 sensitivity index gradually increased throughout the growing season in the tsi time series of biomass phint increased rapidly during the period of 10 15 das then maintained a maximum and decreased the other parameters tended to increase as the reproductive period progressed the results of the lai tsi time series are shown in fig 4 in the early part of the growth period phint was more sensitive to lai than other genetic parameters in the later part of the growing season p1 and p5 sensitivity gradually increased throughout the growing season in the tsi time series of lai phint increased rapidly during 10 15 das then maintained a maximum and decreased the other parameters tended to increase as the phenological period progressed the inflection point was defined as the point at which the phint parameter sensitivity index began to decrease from its maximum value corresponding to das the inflection point represents the time when the parameter sensitivity began to change the intersection point was defined as the das corresponding to the point at which the sensitivity indices of the two parameters phint and p1 were equal the intersection point represents the time at which the importance of the parameters exchanged positions the inflection and intersection points differed in the curves of the more sensitive two parameters phint and p1 over time in the different treatments for biomass the inflection point of d1 in the early water deficit treatment appeared earlier in 2013 table 3 2013 i1d1 2013 i2d1 and 2014 table 3 2014 i1d1 2014 i2d1 around 43 das during the jointing period in the other treatments the inflection point appeared between 60 and 70 das during the anthesis period the intersection points of the two important parameters phint and p1 were different in the different treatments the d1 treatments table 3 i1d1 i2d1 had an earlier intersection point before the tassel stage the d2 treatments table 3 i1d2 i2d2 had an intersection point at the anthesis stage the d3 treatments table 3 i1d3 i2d3 where the sensitivity indices of both parameters changed more smoothly remained without an intersection point after harvest phint had the highest sensitivity index throughout the growth period in the d1 and d2 treatments the time from the inflection point to the intersection point was shorter and the sensitivity index of the parameter changed faster in the d3 d4 and ck treatments table 3 ck the time from the inflection point to the intersection point was longer and the sensitivity index of the parameter changed more smoothly and slowly after the inflection point the sensitivity index of phint decrease for each treatment while the sensitivity of p1 increased significantly from 60 80 das the magnitude of the sensitivity indices of phint and p1 changed order also these 20 days were the filling period of summer maize for lai the trends of the phint and p1 sensitivity indices were not significantly different in the treatments in either 2013 and 2014 with the inflection points between 31 and 40 das concentrated before the jointing stage table 3 the crossover points were concentrated between 50 and 63 das during the tassel stage table 3 after the inflection point the sensitivity index of phint decreased for each treatment in contrast the sensitivity of p1 and p5 gradually increased with a change in the parameter sensitivity index between 30 and 60 das during the jointing and anthesis stages 4 discussion 4 1 first order and total sensitivity indices p1 was the most sensitive parameter for anthesis and p5 was the most sensitive parameter for maturity the most sensitive parameters for yield were p1 p5 and g3 these results agreed with previous studies dejonge et al 2012 the direct effect of each parameter on the anthesis stage was significant and the interaction effect was small for the maturity stage the parameter g2 first order sensitivity index was large showing a solid interaction effect while the interaction effects for other parameters were small for the three outputs of yield biomass and leaf area all six genotype parameters showed interaction effects between parameters on sensitivity for biomass and yield the difference between fost and tos for each parameter was relatively small for the early water deficit treatments d1 d2 and the number of sensitive parameters was also small for the late water deficit treatments d3 d4 the differences in fost and tos for each parameter were large indicating that the interaction between parameters was more vital for lai the fost of p1 and phint were large and the interaction between parameters was significant while the fost for all other parameters was small 4 2 differences between end season sensitivity index and times series sensitivity index the time series sensitivity index for biomass showed that phint and p1 were the two sensitive parameters in contrast the end of season sensitivity index showed that p1 was sensitive and phint was slightly sensitive with different results for the two sensitivity algorithms for lai the time series sensitivity index showed that p1 p5 and phint were the sensitive parameters in contrast the end of season sensitivity index showed that p1 and phint were sensitive this difference was because the time series sensitivity index included the end of season sensitivity index which was only one day of the time series sensitivity index and had certain limitations it is still necessary to consider the parameter sensitivity for the entire growth period from a global perspective in reference to parameter optimization 4 3 effect of different periods of crop water deficit on sensitivity analysis the sensitivity of the parameters differed significantly between the different water treatment conditions with respect to phenological stages the sensitivity of parameters did not differ significantly among treatments the model does not consider the effect of water on the phenological period but only the meteorological factors when calculating crop phenology in previous studies the sensitivity ranking of the various parameters related to the phenological stage decreased when water was higher in contrast the sensitivity index of various parameters related to the phenological stage p1 became larger when water was lacking while the sensitivity index of various parameters related to yield g2 and g3 became smaller dejonge et al 2012 in this study the sensitivity index of the phenology related parameters p1 p5 was high in the early water deficit treatments d1 d2 and both the phenology related and yield related parameters had high sensitivity indices in the later water deficit treatments d3 d4 where the phenology related parameters also showed more parameter interactions the i1d1 treatment in 2014 was significantly different from the other treatments this could be due to the high temperature in june 2014 that exacerbated the drought especially in the early growth period this result also indicates that adjusting critical parameters of the key species related to the phenological stage when the crop was subjected to drought will be more beneficial for parameter optimization in contrast when the crop was well watered a combination of all parameters needs to be adjusted to achieve better parameter optimization phint is an important parameter related to the number of leaves the number of leaves increases during the asexual growth stage but after anthesis the number of leaves does not sustain growth therefore after anthesis the time series sensitivity index of phint to lai and biomass gradually decreased p1 is the cumulative temperature from seedling emergence to the three leaf stage of maize and determines whether seedlings are vigorous or not the three leaf stage is an important point in the seedling stage of maize and is the point in time when maize moves from autotrophy to heterotrophy among the parameters p1 was the sensitive parameter to the anthesis stage and the sensitivity index of p1 gradually increased after the anthesis stage the mechanism of this phenomenon needs to be further explained the sensitivity of the parameters had different details under different treatments when drought occurred at the seedling stage d1 the time series sensitivity of phint decreased earlier than observed for the other treatments these results can provide some references for plant breeding and parameter optimization 5 conclusion in this study sa was used to quantitatively analyze the effect of different water treatments on ceres maize model output and to identify the sensitivity of end season output variables yield lai biomass anthesis and maturity and time series output variables biomass and lai based on the efast method the results showed that water stresses at different growth stages influenced the sensitivity of the crop parameters to output variables the fsi and tsi of p1 and phint were more sensitive to anthesis and lai p1 p5 and phint were more sensitive to maturity p1 p5 and phint were more sensitive to biomass and yield the fosi and tosi time series for the output variables showed consistency between different years our results demonstrate that the sensitivity of some crop parameters to lai and biomass varied throughout the season and that changes in these crop parameters correlated closely with crop growth period and water management therefore we recommend that attention be given to the more sensitive parameter phint to improve simulation accuracy in the early growth period before maximum leaf area development for lai and biomass it will be necessary to focus on parameters p1 and p5 to improve simulation accuracy for lai and biomass during the later growth period after maximum leaf area development under different water management conditions the sensitivity of phint to biomass decreased earlier and faster when drought occurred in the early growth period d1 and d2 the time series of sensitivity index was consistent with the ck treatment when drought occurred in the later growth period d3 and d2 phint and p1 were most sensitive to lai when drought occurred in the early growth period d1 and d2 in addition to phint and p1 other parameters also had particular sensitivity for lai when drought occurred in the later growth period d3 and d4 in the future researchers should give attention to the sensitivity of parameters to the output parameters at the end of the growing season and also give attention to the sensitivity of various parameters to the time series outputs when the ceres maize model is calibrated finally the effects of meteorological conditions and soil parameters on sa should be explored to improve the calibration and validation of the ceres maize model funding this study was

9202,sensitivity analysis sa is used to identify the effects of crop model input parameters on model results previous studies have indicated that the ceres maize model was difficult to calibrate under the different water stress conditions a genetic parameters time series sensitivity analysis is needed to guide parameter optimization the objectives of this study were to i comprehensively quantify the genetic parameters in ceres maize based on the extended fourier amplitude sensitivity test the sensitivity of ceres maize output variables was analyzed under different water stress conditions ii determine the sensitivities of output variables to genetic parameters during the growth period the results demonstrated that output variable sensitivity varied in response to different water stress conditions the total sensitivity index tsi and time dependent tsi of crop parameters were more sensitive than the first sensitivity index fosi and time dependent fosi of crop genetic parameters the sensitivities of two years 2013 and 2014 based on fosi and time series fosi were consistent some differences existed between simulations based on tsi and time series tsi under different water management conditions the sensitivity of phyllochron interval phint to biomass decreased earlier and faster when drought occurred in the early growth period d1 and d2 the time series of sensitivity index was consistent with the ck treatment when drought happened in the later growth periods d3 and d2 the two parameters of phint and thermal time from emergence to end of juvenile p1 were most sensitive to leaf area index lai when drought occurred in the early growth periods d1 and d2 in addition to phint and p1 other parameters also had sensitivities for lai when drought occurred in later growth periods d3 and d4 future studies should focus on the response of dynamic output variable to soil parameters and weather conditions over the growing season in order to calibrate and apply the ceres maize model keywords dssat model maize crop genetic parameters global sensitivity analysis time series crop yield biomass lai efast method data availability the authors do not have permission to share data 1 introduction crop models are essential tools for ecological agronomic and environmental research and for crop management such models are used to simulate the behavior of soil crop systems that respond to the climate and agricultural management jones et al 2003 these models are helpful in understanding interactions between crops and the environment and are beneficial for predicting crop growth status and estimating crop yield attia et al 2016 dokoohaki et al 2015 fakhr et al 2012 zhang 2012 crop models are mathematical representations of agricultural processes based on theory and empirical research their equations and parameterizations inevitably entail assumptions and simplifications of reality and they lead to uncertainty and inaccuracy of output variables he et al 2016 jiang et al 2011 liang et al 2017 song et al 2014 yao et al 2015 crop models often contain many parameters with considerable uncertainties that can cause uncertainty in predictions dejonge et al 2012 jin et al 2018 liang et al 2017 zhang 2012 parameter sensitivity plays an important guiding role in model calibration therefore model calibration is necessary model calibration can also help users understand the internal mechanisms and processes of the crop model better sensitivity analysis sa allows for qualitative or quantitative estimation of the effects of input parameters on the model output variables jones et al 2012 pianosi et al 2016 pogson et al 2012 zhang et al 2018 by analyzing the results of the sensitivity analysis sa the user can selectively eliminate insensitive calibration parameters thereby significantly improving the calibration efficiency of the model therefore sa is widely used to guide crop model calibration local sa and global sa are two widely applied techniques in parameter sa local sa concentrates on the primary first order impacts of factors parameters or variables on model outputs vanuytrecht et al 2014 wang et al 2013a it is used to determine the influence of changes in one parameter on a model s output variables while all the other parameters are set to arbitrary values local sa only considers one parameter s effect on the output variables and it is well suited for linear and near linear models but is unsuitable for non linear models global sa assumes that all of the parameters vary within the defined range of the input variables it aims to assign all of the output variables uncertainty to the input variables uncertainty li et al 2019 wang et al 2013b the global sa method fully considers parameter interactions and non linear responses however it spends more time calculating the variation ranges of all parameters several global sa methods have been developed including the morris method morris 1991 sobol method sobol 1993 2001 fourier amplitude sensitivity test fast cukier et al 1978 and extended fast efast saltelli et al 1999 in the morris method factors are arranged based on the order of their importance so this method cannot be used to quantify the effect of each factor on output variables variance based methods analyze the effects of each parameter and interactions among different parameters some scientists have used global sa methods to research crop growth models he et al 2016 sobol 1993 dejonge et al 2012 studied the variation and differences in the sensitivity of maize parameters under water deficit and water sufficiency wang et al 2021 studied the sensitivity of maize parameters under different irrigation and fertilization conditions previous studies concluded that the sensitivity of parameters would vary under different management the ceres maize model can simulate daily crop growth process attia et al 2016 dokoohaki et al 2015 song et al 2015 different management methods will inevitably affect the simulation process as a crop environment genotype interaction system the results of crop models and the sensitivity of crop genetic parameters will not remain unchanged throughout the growth period the tolerance of crops to water stress varies with the phenological period the occurrence of water stress also affects crop growth and yield formation song et al 2016 showed that the ceres maize model had high simulation accuracy when drought occurred in a later growth period however when drought occurred at the seedling and jointing stages especially the jointing stage accuracy was low it can be seen that the drought duration and degree have a significant influence on the simulation accuracy of the ceres maize model the advance in drought duration and the aggravation of drought degree can reduce model simulation accuracy dejonge et al 2012 showed that crop model parameter sensitivity was different under different irrigation conditions under different irrigation methods the model parameters had little difference in the phenological period but greatly influenced yield and leaf area index the sensitivity of crop cultivar parameters increased more under complete irrigation conditions than under limited irrigation conditions therefore it is essential to analyze the sensitivity of crop model parameters during the entire growth period under different water stress conditions for calibration of crop model parameters in addition few studies had conducted a global sa based on the efast method for the ceres maize model under different water management conditions there have been few reports regarding global sas based on time series output variable sensitivity during different crop growth periods cukier et al 1978 stella et al 2014 therefore the objectives of this study were as follows i based on the efast method we comprehensively identified the effects of parameter variation on the sensitivity of ceres maize output variables anthesis maturity yield dry biomass and lai under different irrigation conditions ii we studied the time series changes in parameter sensitivity under different irrigation conditions iii different conditions lead to different conclusions from sa and the results will provide suggestions for using the ceres maize model to simulate maize growth and development under different conditions 2 material and methods 2 1 site and experiment description from june to october 2013 and june to october 2014 field trials were conducted at the water saving irrigation experimental station 34 17 n 108 04 e 506 m above sea level of northwest a f university of yangling shaanxi song et al 2016 at the experimental site the frost free period for the entire year is 221 days the average annual rainfall from june to september is 337 mm song et al 2016 the average bulk density of the 0 100 cm soil layer is 1 31 g cm 3 and the water holding capacity and wilting water content of the field are 0 26 cm3 cm 3 and 0 12 cm3 cm 3 respectively the ph of the 0 20 cm soil layer is 8 14 the organic carbon content is 8 20 g kg 1 and the total nitrogen content is 0 62 g kg 1 in the experimental plot the planted area was 8 m2 there was a 1 5 m deep polyethylene plastic isolation layer between the districts that prevented side seepage there was a moveable rain shelter in the test area and the shelter could be closed during rainfall to prevent the impact of natural rainfall on the test results before beginning the experiment the soil water content of the 0 100 cm soil layer in each plot was measured the initial moisture content of the soil was also determined by the layered soil drying method before planting to ensure the same initial water content in each plot the plot with the highest water content among all plots was targeted for irrigation the summer maize variety used in the experiment was zheng dan 958 the field was furrowed and seeded manually the direction of the ditches was east to west the distance between each maize plant was 30 cm and the distance between each row was 50 cm the planting depth was 5 cm and there were four rows in each small area there were 13 plants in each row before planting we applied fertilizer at the rate of 210 kg n hm 2 and 160 kg p2o5 hm 2 in 2013 plots were planted on june 12 and harvested on october 7 in 2014 plots were planted on june 12 and harvested on october 7 we considered two factors irrigation volume and drought stage according to the historical rainfall during the maize growing season we established two irrigation levels 280 mm low water annual growth period rainfall and 440 mm high water annual growth period rainfall we divided the total irrigation amounts into four uniform applications resulting in two irrigation water levels 70 mm and 110 mm designated as i1and i2 the entire maize growing season was divided into four main growth stages seedling emergence jointing heading and filling drought occurred in a single growth stage there were four different drought situations d1 d4 therefore there were eight treatments in this experiment table 1 with each treatment replicated three times in addition we established a control treatment ck that was irrigated with 110 mm at each growth stage the irrigation applied to each plot was recorded and water was manually applied evenly to each zone the meteorological data needed for the model were from the yangling meteorological station located about 100 m away from the experimental site observation data included daily maximum temperature minimum temperature precipitation and sunshine hours 2 2 description of the dssat model dssat decision support system for agrotechnology transfer is one of the most widely used crop model systems jones et al 2003 dssat can simulate the growth and development of daily crops and calculate the impact of various factors on crop yield fakhr et al 2012 huffman et al 2015 liu et al 2010 yao ning et al 2015 therefore dssat can be used for different research objects and purposes the ceres maize model is a sub model of the dssat 4 6 series model that simulates the growth and development of maize the model considers climate soil variety fertilizer and other effects on maize growth the potential production of maize can be calculated from the effective photosynthetically active radiation intercepted from the crop canopy the actual biomass can be calculated by temperature water and nitrogen stress factors shrestha et al 2013 the ceres maize model has been widely used in agricultural research regarding maize this model can accurately simulate maize yield and nitrogen uptake under sprinkler irrigation conditions precise simulation results were obtained in southern canada by simulating maize yield and soil nitrogen dynamics he et al 2016 also used the ceres maize model to simulate the growth of sweet maize in florida usa and they used the model to develop the optimal management measures for water and fertilizer in china previous research related to the ceres maize model has included many areas such as determination and validation of maize genetic parameters effects of different planting periods and irrigation on spring maize yield assessment of climate change on agricultural benefits determination of crop irrigation water requirements prediction of different crop growth conditions and sensitivity analysis of crop parameters li et al 2019 song et al 2015 thus the ceres maize model has become a powerful tool for studying the worldwide maize growth environment according to previous studies the ceres maize model can accurately simulate maize leaf area index lai yield biomass and soil water content under full water conditions however in the case of water deficits the simulation of lai aboveground biomass and yield has been wholly underestimated that is the quantitative description of the water deficit effects has been inaccurate in arid and semi arid regions the ceres maize model was not accurate enough to simulate the growth and development of maize under water deficit conditions song et al 2016 yao et al 2016 in the case of insufficient irrigation the improvement of simulation accuracy of the model still needs further study and parameter sensitivity analysis can provide a basis and reference for parameter optimization in particular sensitivity analysis of crop parameters in time series can help to improve the simulation accuracy of time series variables 2 3 input and output parameters ceres maize input parameters can affect crop growth table 2 song et al 2016 this study analyzed the sensitivity of crop variety parameters p1 p2 p5 g2 g3 and phint random values for each parameter were determined assuming a uniform distribution between the lower and upper bounds table 1 dejonge et al 2012 jin et al 2018 according to song s study song et al 2016 upper and lower limits for cultivar parameters were generally determined the parameter ranges varied up or down by 50 depending on the estimated parameters table 2 model phenophase outputs included anthesis day and maturity day after planting aday and mday respectively crop growth outputs included tops weight at maturity and maximum leaf area index biomass and laix respectively and the most crucial evaluation output was crop yield yield this study used two years 2013 2014 of data from a summer maize water limited experiment using the ceres maize model two kinds of output time series outputs daily biomass leaf area index and annual outputs anthesis maturity biomass yield maximum lai combined with simlab sensitivity analysis software tarantola and becker 2017 the sensitivity of parameters was analyzed by the efast method andarzian et al 2011 wang et al 2018 2 4 efast method the efast method is a global sensitivity analysis method based on variance decomposition it combines the advantages of sobol s method and the fourier amplitude sensitivity method fast he et al 2015 song et al 2014 xing et al 2017 in this method the model s output is analyzed by fourier transform and the spectrum curve of the fourier series is obtained the variance of model results caused by the interaction of each parameter is obtained by the spectrum curve the interaction between the parameters produces the total variance of the model the most crucial feature of efast is the reduction in computational load time of the computer by sampling the parameters through the search function the efast method is a quantitative evaluation method used for uncertainty analysis it has a broad scope of study and high accuracy the analysis results are based on a large number of parameter sampling that can give the relative sensitivity between parameters and quantitatively calculate the contribution rate of each parameter to the variance of model results 3 results 3 1 impacts of water stress at different growth stages on first order sensitivity index and total sensitivity index the efast method calculated the first order sensitivity index fosi and total sensitivity index tsi of anthesis maturity yield biomass and maximum lai the fosi and tsi of the five outputs are shown in fig 1 the results for anthesis maturity yield biomass and maximum lai all showed that the importance of crop parameters based on fosi and tsi was related to different years of meteorological data and water treatments sensitivity index values range from 0 to 1 the closer the value to 1 the more influential the respective parameters is a value greater than 0 05 indicates significant parameter sensitivity in 2013 p1 was the parameter with the greatest sensitivity index for anthesis fig 1 a phint was second fig 1 a in 2014 the sensitivity index of phint became greater in the i1d1 treatment fig 1 a and the parameters interaction became significant in the i2d1 treatment fig 1 u the sensitivity of the parameter in the other treatments remained the same as in 2013 among all treatments in 2013 maturity was the most sensitive to p5 followed by p1 and phint fig 1 b all three parameters showed a great tsi and g2 had strong interactions with the other parameters the sensitivity indices of the parameters differed less between treatments in 2014 the most sensitive parameter was phint in treatment i1d1 fig 1 b the most sensitive parameter was p1 in treatment i2d1 fig 1 v and two parameters p5 and g2 showed a strong interaction in the other treatments p5 and p1 were sensitive parameters for biomass p1 and phint were more sensitive in d1 treatment i1d1 fig 1 c and i2d1 fig 1 w in 2013 for d2 treatment i1d2 fig 1 h and i2d2 fig 1 bb the most sensitive parameter was p1 with p5 being the next most sensitive input parameter for d3 treatment i1d3 fig 1 m and i2d3 fig 1 gg all six parameters showed sensitivity with four parameters p1 p5 g3 and phint being more sensitive than the other parameters the d4 treatment i1d4 fig 1 r and i2d4 fig 1 ii showed great sensitivity index values for all parameters except for p2 which exhibited a less sensitive index p1 was the most sensitive parameter the parameter sensitivity for the ck treatment fig 1 qq was similar to that of the d4 treatment with p1 being the most sensitive parameter and p5 being the next most sensitive parameter the sensitivity of p2 to yield was not significant in both 2013 and 2014 in d1 fig 1 d x and d2 fig 1 i cc treatments in 2013 the number of sensitive parameters was fewer only p1 and p5 while in d3 fig 1 n hh and d4 fig 1 s mm treatments all parameters except p2 had high tsi in 2014 compared with 2013 the number of sensitive parameters increased three parameters p1 p5 and phint were sensitive in the d1 treatment fig 1 d x with phint being the most sensitive in the d2 treatment fig 1 i cc p5 was the most sensitive parameter and in the d3 treatment all parameters showed a strong interaction in i1d3 fig 1 n where the largest tsi was g3 and the largest fosi was phint in i2d3 fig 1 hh the largest tsi was p5 and the largest fosi parameter was p1 the d4 treatment fig 1 s mm showed the largest tsi and fosi for both p1 parameters and ck treatment fig 1 rr showed the largest tsi for p5 and the largest fosi for p1 for maximum lai p1 and phint were the more sensitive parameters while the other parameters were less sensitive the most sensitive parameters differed between treatments with p1 being the most sensitive in the 2013 treatments i1d1 fig 1 e i1d3 fig 1 o i1d4 fig 1 t i2d1 fig 1 y i2d2 fig 1 dd and phint being the most sensitive in the other treatments in 2014 the parameters with the strongest sensitivity were still p1 and phint with phint being the most sensitive in i1d1 fig 1 e and i1d2 fig 1 j and p1 was the most sensitive in the other treatments 3 2 parameter sensitivity for time series output the ceres maize model simulates dynamic changes and the final yield is based on an accurate simulation of output variables that vary over time therefore it was necessary to analyze the sensitivity of ceres maize parameters to two important time varying output variables lai and biomass the results showed slight differences between the fosi and tsi time series figs 2 5 time series for tsi was shown in figs 2 and 4 and time series for fosi was shown in figs 3 and 5 the results of the biomass tsi time series showed that phint was the most sensitive to dry biomass fig 2 in the early part of the growth period phint was more sensitive to biomass than other genetic parameters in the later part of the growing season the p1 sensitivity index gradually increased throughout the growing season in the tsi time series of biomass phint increased rapidly during the period of 10 15 das then maintained a maximum and decreased the other parameters tended to increase as the reproductive period progressed the results of the lai tsi time series are shown in fig 4 in the early part of the growth period phint was more sensitive to lai than other genetic parameters in the later part of the growing season p1 and p5 sensitivity gradually increased throughout the growing season in the tsi time series of lai phint increased rapidly during 10 15 das then maintained a maximum and decreased the other parameters tended to increase as the phenological period progressed the inflection point was defined as the point at which the phint parameter sensitivity index began to decrease from its maximum value corresponding to das the inflection point represents the time when the parameter sensitivity began to change the intersection point was defined as the das corresponding to the point at which the sensitivity indices of the two parameters phint and p1 were equal the intersection point represents the time at which the importance of the parameters exchanged positions the inflection and intersection points differed in the curves of the more sensitive two parameters phint and p1 over time in the different treatments for biomass the inflection point of d1 in the early water deficit treatment appeared earlier in 2013 table 3 2013 i1d1 2013 i2d1 and 2014 table 3 2014 i1d1 2014 i2d1 around 43 das during the jointing period in the other treatments the inflection point appeared between 60 and 70 das during the anthesis period the intersection points of the two important parameters phint and p1 were different in the different treatments the d1 treatments table 3 i1d1 i2d1 had an earlier intersection point before the tassel stage the d2 treatments table 3 i1d2 i2d2 had an intersection point at the anthesis stage the d3 treatments table 3 i1d3 i2d3 where the sensitivity indices of both parameters changed more smoothly remained without an intersection point after harvest phint had the highest sensitivity index throughout the growth period in the d1 and d2 treatments the time from the inflection point to the intersection point was shorter and the sensitivity index of the parameter changed faster in the d3 d4 and ck treatments table 3 ck the time from the inflection point to the intersection point was longer and the sensitivity index of the parameter changed more smoothly and slowly after the inflection point the sensitivity index of phint decrease for each treatment while the sensitivity of p1 increased significantly from 60 80 das the magnitude of the sensitivity indices of phint and p1 changed order also these 20 days were the filling period of summer maize for lai the trends of the phint and p1 sensitivity indices were not significantly different in the treatments in either 2013 and 2014 with the inflection points between 31 and 40 das concentrated before the jointing stage table 3 the crossover points were concentrated between 50 and 63 das during the tassel stage table 3 after the inflection point the sensitivity index of phint decreased for each treatment in contrast the sensitivity of p1 and p5 gradually increased with a change in the parameter sensitivity index between 30 and 60 das during the jointing and anthesis stages 4 discussion 4 1 first order and total sensitivity indices p1 was the most sensitive parameter for anthesis and p5 was the most sensitive parameter for maturity the most sensitive parameters for yield were p1 p5 and g3 these results agreed with previous studies dejonge et al 2012 the direct effect of each parameter on the anthesis stage was significant and the interaction effect was small for the maturity stage the parameter g2 first order sensitivity index was large showing a solid interaction effect while the interaction effects for other parameters were small for the three outputs of yield biomass and leaf area all six genotype parameters showed interaction effects between parameters on sensitivity for biomass and yield the difference between fost and tos for each parameter was relatively small for the early water deficit treatments d1 d2 and the number of sensitive parameters was also small for the late water deficit treatments d3 d4 the differences in fost and tos for each parameter were large indicating that the interaction between parameters was more vital for lai the fost of p1 and phint were large and the interaction between parameters was significant while the fost for all other parameters was small 4 2 differences between end season sensitivity index and times series sensitivity index the time series sensitivity index for biomass showed that phint and p1 were the two sensitive parameters in contrast the end of season sensitivity index showed that p1 was sensitive and phint was slightly sensitive with different results for the two sensitivity algorithms for lai the time series sensitivity index showed that p1 p5 and phint were the sensitive parameters in contrast the end of season sensitivity index showed that p1 and phint were sensitive this difference was because the time series sensitivity index included the end of season sensitivity index which was only one day of the time series sensitivity index and had certain limitations it is still necessary to consider the parameter sensitivity for the entire growth period from a global perspective in reference to parameter optimization 4 3 effect of different periods of crop water deficit on sensitivity analysis the sensitivity of the parameters differed significantly between the different water treatment conditions with respect to phenological stages the sensitivity of parameters did not differ significantly among treatments the model does not consider the effect of water on the phenological period but only the meteorological factors when calculating crop phenology in previous studies the sensitivity ranking of the various parameters related to the phenological stage decreased when water was higher in contrast the sensitivity index of various parameters related to the phenological stage p1 became larger when water was lacking while the sensitivity index of various parameters related to yield g2 and g3 became smaller dejonge et al 2012 in this study the sensitivity index of the phenology related parameters p1 p5 was high in the early water deficit treatments d1 d2 and both the phenology related and yield related parameters had high sensitivity indices in the later water deficit treatments d3 d4 where the phenology related parameters also showed more parameter interactions the i1d1 treatment in 2014 was significantly different from the other treatments this could be due to the high temperature in june 2014 that exacerbated the drought especially in the early growth period this result also indicates that adjusting critical parameters of the key species related to the phenological stage when the crop was subjected to drought will be more beneficial for parameter optimization in contrast when the crop was well watered a combination of all parameters needs to be adjusted to achieve better parameter optimization phint is an important parameter related to the number of leaves the number of leaves increases during the asexual growth stage but after anthesis the number of leaves does not sustain growth therefore after anthesis the time series sensitivity index of phint to lai and biomass gradually decreased p1 is the cumulative temperature from seedling emergence to the three leaf stage of maize and determines whether seedlings are vigorous or not the three leaf stage is an important point in the seedling stage of maize and is the point in time when maize moves from autotrophy to heterotrophy among the parameters p1 was the sensitive parameter to the anthesis stage and the sensitivity index of p1 gradually increased after the anthesis stage the mechanism of this phenomenon needs to be further explained the sensitivity of the parameters had different details under different treatments when drought occurred at the seedling stage d1 the time series sensitivity of phint decreased earlier than observed for the other treatments these results can provide some references for plant breeding and parameter optimization 5 conclusion in this study sa was used to quantitatively analyze the effect of different water treatments on ceres maize model output and to identify the sensitivity of end season output variables yield lai biomass anthesis and maturity and time series output variables biomass and lai based on the efast method the results showed that water stresses at different growth stages influenced the sensitivity of the crop parameters to output variables the fsi and tsi of p1 and phint were more sensitive to anthesis and lai p1 p5 and phint were more sensitive to maturity p1 p5 and phint were more sensitive to biomass and yield the fosi and tosi time series for the output variables showed consistency between different years our results demonstrate that the sensitivity of some crop parameters to lai and biomass varied throughout the season and that changes in these crop parameters correlated closely with crop growth period and water management therefore we recommend that attention be given to the more sensitive parameter phint to improve simulation accuracy in the early growth period before maximum leaf area development for lai and biomass it will be necessary to focus on parameters p1 and p5 to improve simulation accuracy for lai and biomass during the later growth period after maximum leaf area development under different water management conditions the sensitivity of phint to biomass decreased earlier and faster when drought occurred in the early growth period d1 and d2 the time series of sensitivity index was consistent with the ck treatment when drought occurred in the later growth period d3 and d2 phint and p1 were most sensitive to lai when drought occurred in the early growth period d1 and d2 in addition to phint and p1 other parameters also had particular sensitivity for lai when drought occurred in the later growth period d3 and d4 in the future researchers should give attention to the sensitivity of parameters to the output parameters at the end of the growing season and also give attention to the sensitivity of various parameters to the time series outputs when the ceres maize model is calibrated finally the effects of meteorological conditions and soil parameters on sa should be explored to improve the calibration and validation of the ceres maize model funding this study was

9203,potato bears the burden of eliminating hunger and supporting food security quantitative assessment of potato drought disaster risk can help the sustainable development of the potato industry and improve the regional disaster management capacity this is also a major and urgent demand for food security this study constructed a comprehensive drought condition index cdci for different months of the potato growing season based on the soil plant atmosphere continuum spac system quantitatively assessed potato drought disaster risk based on the four factor theory of natural disaster risk formation and discussed the historical and future planting environmental conditions in inner mongolia china the results showed that the non overlap between suitable areas of agro climatic resources and main planting areas is the main reason for the occurrence of potato drought disasters and the extremely high risk area and high risk area areas were concentrated in the current main planting areas which was one of the problems encountered in the sustainable development of potato industry in inner mongolia the analysis of future drought hazard changes indicates the need to pay attention not only to the possible persistence of drought hazard in near term but also to the possible waterlogging hazard in mid long term the different situations of land use cover change lucc in inner mongolia and various agricultural resources and environmental zones agrirezones have confirmed the necessity of separating regions for agricultural drought risk analysis and management the present study can be used as a reference for adjusting the layout of the potato industry and provide a basis for agricultural disaster prevention and reduction keywords potato drought risk agricultural resource and environment zoning china data availability the authors do not have permission to share data 1 introduction potato solanum tuberosum l is a perennial herb of the solanaceae family with edible tubers it is the fourth largest food crop in the world after wheat rice and corn the united nations designated 2008 as the international year of the potato calling the potato a buried treasure and calling on the world to focus on the irreplaceable importance of the potato in alleviating the food crisis ensuring food security and achieving the millennium development goals hoekstra 2008 potato is grown in 158 countries and territories worldwide faostat 2018 potato is an essential means of ensuring food security and a major source of income for developing countries and is classified as a strategic reserve food by many countries haas et al 2009 li 1985 zhang et al 2017 chakraborty et al 2010 the 2021 state of food security and nutrition in the world report food and agriculture organization of the united nations fao 2021 estimates that 720 811 million people faced hunger in 2020 a looming catastrophe climate change is regarded as one of the important factors inducing the global food crisis and the frequent occurrence of climate disasters makes it difficult for the international community to achieve the goal of the zero hunger challenge by 2030 significant fluctuations in global agricultural production and increased food supply instability pose a substantial risk to global and regional food security with the intensification of global climate change hijmans 2003 predicted that if adaptation is not considered global potato production will decline by 10 19 in 2010 39 and 18 32 in 2050 raymundo et al 2017 applied future climate change scenarios to current potato cropping systems the global tuber yield decreased slightly 2 to 6 in 2055 and significantly 2 to 26 in 2085 climate change causes extreme weather and precipitation heterogeneity which seriously threaten the food security of agroecosystems suri et al 2021 droughts cause an average of nearly 600 to 8 billion in global economic losses yearly keyantash and dracup 2004 yagci et al 2013 chatterjee et al 2022 agricultural drought has seriously hampered agricultural development in developing countries and is a complex phenomenon worldwide the area of crops affected by drought in china reaches 2 0 105 km2 per year china meteorological administration 2020 china is one of the countries most affected by climate change ipcc 2022 china is the largest potato producer in the world accounting for approximately 1 4 of the world s area and total output wang et al 2019 the potential contribution of potato to china s food self sufficiency is far greater than that of the other three major food crops wang et al 2018 inner mongolia is one of china s top five potato producing provinces ranking among the top three in planted area and total production accounting for more than 10 of china s output drought disaster is one of the main factors restricting the development of the potato industry in inner mongolia jansky et al 2009 wang et al 2021 the frequency and regionality of extreme weather events increase the difficulty of agricultural risk management potato which has rich nutrition good productivity and wide adaptability is one of the most promising crops of the 21st century however current agro meteorological disaster risk research has primarily focused on corn wheat and rice zhang 2004 wassmann et al 2009 julia dingkuhn 2013 zhang et al 2019 2021 li et al 2021a studies on potato drought have focused on its physiology biochemistry and quality for the world s most common and widely distributed natural disaster drought disaster quantitative assessment of the risk can help the sustainable development of the potato industry and improve regional disaster management capacity this is a major and urgent demand for food security at present there are three main views on the formation of natural disaster risk 1 the two factor method of risk formation proposed by okada norio r h v 2 the three factor method of risk formation proposed by tatano hirozazu r h v e 3 by refining the risk theory zhang jiquan put forward a four factors method combining the concept of disaster prevention and mitigation capability with risk formation r h v e 1 c h hazard of disaster e exposure of disaster bearing body v vulnerability of disaster bearing body c disaster prevention and reduction capability guo et al 2016 jia et al 2012 liu et al 2013 un isdr united nations international strategy for disaster reduction 2007 zhang et al 2017 ipcc intergovernmental panel on climate change 2007a began to advocate improving disaster prevention and mitigation capabilities reducing disaster risks summarizing experiences in disaster risk management and seeking ways to adapt to climate change in the context of global warming drought has shown a global normalization trend inner mongolia spans a large area from east to west with significant geographical differences in cultivated land resources agricultural resources and environmental zoning are ways to analyze the characteristics of resource and environmental problems and agricultural production conditions in each region and to propose the spatial layout and development direction for the rational use and protection of agricultural resources and the environment xu 2021 therefore distinguishing agricultural resources and environmental zones and emphasizing the ability of disaster prevention and mitigation to conduct agricultural drought risk analysis can help improve the regional disaster management ability according to local conditions and reduce the potential drought risk under climate change jia et al 2016 drought is usually divided into four types meteorological drought agricultural drought hydrological drought and socio economic drought wilhite and glantz 1985 conventional drought assessment and monitoring usually focus on the meteorological aspects of drought and precipitation and or evapotranspiration data are typically used to establish meteorological drought indices for spatial and temporal monitoring palmer 1965 mckee et al 1993 svoboda et al 2002 guttman 1998 heim 2002 vicente serrano et al 2010 beguería et al 2014 sadri et al 2018 however meteorological drought is not equivalent to agricultural drought agricultural drought is a complex process involving many comprehensive factors such as soil crops atmosphere and human use of resources this is not only a physical process but also related to the biological process of the crop itself wilhite and glantz 1985 keyantash and dracup 2004 rhee et al 2010 martínez fernández et al 2015 leng and hall 2019 chatterjee et al 2022 soil moisture sm dominates the dryness stress of global ecosystem production and is essential for describing and predicting agriculture liu et al 2020 chatterjee et al 2022 potato is a drought tolerant plant with high adaptability and water absorption capacity the flow process of water from the soil through plants to the atmosphere can be studied as a unified dynamic and continuous system this system is called the soil plant atmosphere continuum spac therefore we suggest building a comprehensive drought condition index based on the spac system to reflect regional drought to promote potato drought disaster risk assessment the aim of the present study was to quantitatively evaluate potato drought risk in inner mongolia china based on the four factor theory of natural disaster risk formation the objectives were to 1 construct a cdci for different months of the potato growing season based on the spac system 2 quantitatively assess the drought disaster risk for different months of the potato growing season in different agrirezones of inner mongolia and 3 discuss the changes in the potato planting environment history and future the results of this study can provide a scientific basis for understanding the formation mechanism of potato drought disasters in inner mongolia promote an understanding of potato drought disaster risk in the context of climate change and provide new ideas for sustainable potato production in china and other countries 2 data and methodology 2 1 study area inner mongolia 37 24 53 23 n 97 12 126 04 e fig 1 is located on the northern border of china with a total area of 1 18 106 km² the terrain extends obliquely from northeast to southwest in a narrow shape and the landscape is dominated by the mongolian plateau which has a complex and diverse form the climate is dominated by a temperate continental climate with sufficient sunshine large temperature differences between day and night rain and heat in the same season and low incidence of pests and diseases suitable for potato growth needs the fluctuation rate of the potato yield showed a downward trend during the same period precipitation showed a weak increasing trend the fluctuation rates of potato yield and precipitation in inner mongolia passed the correlation test fig a 1 and the correlation decreased from the middle to the east and west with the highest value of 0 62 this shows that potato yield in inner mongolia is primarily affected by precipitation which is consistent with previous studies wang et al 2021 however inner mongolia has a large span from east to west with pronounced regional differences in cultivated land resources it has formed the central potato industry advantage zone with ulanqab as the center and the eastern potato industry advantage zone with hulun buir as the center the central advantage area mainly focuses on breeding and producing virus free seed potato and developing commercial potato production bases around potato processing enterprises which is one of the economic sources of farmers the eastern advantage area mainly produces green fresh potato and builds a production base of processed potato and virus free seed potato she et al 2012 li guo 2021b therefore this study divides inner mongolia into three regions according to china s agricultural resources and environment zoning dataset xu 2021 1 zone 1 z1 northeast zone 2 zone 2 z2 central zone along the great wall and 3 zone 3 z3 northwest arid zone the main potato varieties in inner mongolia include kexin 1 shepody favorita chahar desiree kangnibek atlantic and

development including seven combination scenarios ssp1 1 9 ssp1 2 6 ssp4 3 4 ssp2 4 5 ssp4 6 0 ssp3 7 0 and ssp5 8 5 we selected two scenarios for comparison the low forcing scenario ssp1 2 6 global warming 1 5 in which the future increase in global forest coverage is accompanied by a large amount of land use change and the medium and high forcing scenario ssp3 7 0 global warming 2 0 in which the future decrease in global forest coverage is accompanied by a large amount of land use change the sustainability model ssp1 2 6 is an updated version of rcp2 6 in the coupled model intercomparison project phase 5 cmip5 the regional rivalry model ssp3 7 0 fills the gap in the high forcing scenarios in cmip5 and emphasizes the sensitivity of local climate change to land use and aerosol forcing these two scenarios apply to scientific research concerning the land use model intercomparison project lumip lucc digital elevation model dem river system and population data were obtained from the

https www noaa gov 1982 2015 dataset and the china monthly vegetation index spatial distribution dataset https www resdc cn 1998 2020 sm data and surface evapotranspiration data were obtained from the fifth and latest global climate reanalysis dataset era5 https cds climate copernicus eu cdsapp dataset reanalysis era5 single levels monthly means tab form 1982 2019 the sm was divided into four layers according to the soil depth the potato planting in inner mongolia is ridge planting which is beneficial to water conservation and temperature increase the ridge height was 15 30 cm therefore we used sm data from the first layer 0 7 cm 0 cm on the surface surface evapotranspiration equals the sum of evaporation from bare soil the top of the canopy and vegetation transpiration the data on financial support for agriculture came from the inner mongolia statistical yearbook finally all the data were uniformly interpolated into a 0 05 0 05 grid to maintain consistency 2 3 methods 2 3 1 framework for drought disaster risk assessment natural disasters are events in which natural variation exceeds a certain degree and causes losses to human beings and the social economy natural disaster risk can be described as the possibility of adverse consequences or expected losses caused by variations in natural factors blaikie et al 2014 ipcc 2014 wilhite 2000 ipcc 2007b hazard h refers to the degree of natural variation of disaster causing factors determined by the environmental conditions and the scale and frequency of disaster causing activities vulnerability v refers to the degree of damage to a disaster subject which is determined by the disaster sensitivity and adaptability of the crops exposure e refers to the degree of exposure of a disaster subject to disasters which is determined by the actual and potential exposure of crops exposure is a precondition for disaster subjects to endure natural hazards if a disaster subject is not exposed to disasters it does not have to bear them disaster prevention and mitigation capability c refers to the ability to recover from or respond to disasters and is determined by the ability to prevent reduce resist and relieve disasters based on the four factor method of risk formation this study constructed a framework for the quantitative assessment of potato drought disaster risk fig 2 eqs 1 5 one of the main steps in integrating the identified indicators is to assign weights to elucidate their relative contribution to risk formation we obtained the final weights using principal component analysis in a dual overlay of spatial grid and statistical data table evaluation models of the potato drought disaster risk were constructed using the weighted comprehensive average method 1 r h v e 1 c where r is the potato drought disaster risk index the values of h v e and c respectively represent the hazard exposure vulnerability and disaster prevention and reduction ability indices of the potato drought

disaster relief capabilities 2 3 2 comprehensive drought condition index cdci agricultural drought means that in the process of crop growth owing to insufficient precipitation low soil water content and lack of timely and appropriate irrigation the water supply cannot meet the normal water demand of crops rather than a simple meteorological drought based on the comprehensive action mechanism of the spac system the present study integrates meteorological data remote sensing data and reanalysis multi source data and selects the spei vci and smci to build a cdci which is subject to agrirezone zoning resampling and dimensionless processing 8 cd ci w 1 smci 3 w 2 spei 3 w 3 vci where w 1 w 2 and w 3 are the coefficients of smci spei3 and vci table 1 respectively which were obtained by spatial principal component analysis arcgis the vci is used for long term avhrr observation of drought monitoring kogan 1995 and is obtained by scaling ndvi 9 vci ndvi i ndvi min ndvi max ndvi min where ndvi i is the monthly ndvi of position i grid and ndvi min and ndvi max are the minimum and maximum values of the ndvi at position i over the years respectively the smci is the scaled sm sánchez et al 2016 10 smci sm i sm min sm max sm min where sm i is the monthly sm at location i grid sm min and sm max are the minimum and maximum values of sm at position i over the years respectively vicente et al 2010 proposed the spei to monitor and study the drought process in the context of global warming the spei considers the temperature sensitivity of evapotranspiration and has the advantages of multi scale and multi spatial comparison it has been widely used in drought research the classification of the cdci index is based on the three indexes severe drought 0 cdci 0 3 moderate drought 0 3 cdci 0 4 mild drought 0 4 cdci 0 5 and no drought 0 5 cdci the scale and frequency of disaster causing activities were determined by di and df of each level 11 di i 1 n cdci i 12 df n i m i where cdci i is the cdci value of a certain level of drought occurring in i month n is the number of times a certain level of drought occurred in i month and m is the total number of years 2 3 3 analysis of crop yield crop yield is affected by social and natural factors it is typically divided into three parts trend yield climate induced yield and random error zhao et al 2019 maqsood et al 2020 trend yield refers to the long term change trend of crop yield caused by productivity level in social factors climate induced yield refers to the short term fluctuation in crop yield caused by meteorological conditions random error also known as random noise is typically ignored in research extracting climate induced yield from crop yield is the most common method to study the relationship between climatic factors and crop yield 13 y y t y c e 14 y r y y t y t where y is the actual crop yield y t is the trend yield y c is the climate induced yield e is the random yield random noise which is usually ignored y r is the yield fluctuation rate and the year with the negative value is the year of production reduction currently three methods moving average logistic function fitting and hodrick prescott filter hp filter are commonly used to separate the actual crop yield into trend and climate induced yields although the moving average method and logistic function fitting method are simple and easy to operate they both rely on the assumption that the long term change in grain yield tends toward a specific function model the basic assumption of the hp filter model is that time series data can be regarded as a combination of trend and periodic components hodrick and prescott 1997 ahumada garegnani 2000 ravn uhlig 2002 wu zhou 2010 bunnoon et al 2013 this model effectively separates the two parts of the data in this study the actual crop yield was divided into high frequency climate induced yield and low frequency trend yield components by hp filtering tang 2007 zhao et al 2019 the correlation between the trend yield and actual yield of different administrative units obtained by the hp filtering method exceeded 55 and the regression relationship passed the 0 05 significance test table a 1 the results showed that this method could accurately reflect the trend yield and calculate climate induced yield drought is the most common meteorological disaster in inner mongolia occurring almost yearly the cdci index and the yield fluctuation rate of the potato growth period passed the correlation test fig a 2 the present study characterized the drought susceptibility of potato by combining the frequency and magnitude of yield reduction with the establishment of an agro meteorological damage index the yield reduction rate can be divided into mild 5 to 10 moderate 10 to 15 and severe 15 the y r f and gm values were calculated for each grade the absolute value of the sum of the product of y r f and gm is the drought sensitivity of potato 2 3 4 suitability of agro climatic resources combined with the actual situation of inner mongolia meteorological indices in each growth period of potato and relevant test results we determined the temperature suitability precipitation suitability function and sunshine suitability function and obtained comprehensive planting suitability a temperature suitability 15 s t t t 1 t h t b t 0 t 1 t h

temperature upper limit temperature and appropriate temperature required for each growth period of potato respectively the three base point temperatures of potato in each growth period were determined by referring to the corresponding index system and combined with the production practice table a 2 b precipitation suitability 17 r ro s p r ro 18 r ro s p 1 where s p is the precipitation suitability r is the cumulative precipitation in a certain potato development period ro is the crop water demand in each growth period of potato we referred to the standard crop coefficient of 85 crops

applicability 2 3 5 shift of barycenter in this study the barycenter of the drought hazard was studied using the principle of population barycenters in population geography three agrirezones were selected as the study area and each municipal administrative region was selected as the secondary area specifically the longitude and latitude of the centers of 12 provincial administrative regions were taken as the calculation parameters and the relevant attribute dataset of each administrative region was taken as the calculation attribute value in addition dimensionless processing was performed to ensure the comparability of the data forman 1995 na 2017 analysis of the shift of barycenter by decade 80 s 90 s 00 s and 10 s 23 x t i 1 n s ti x i i 1 n s ti 24 y t i 1 n s ti y i i 1 n

to correspond to the actual meteorological data based on the principle of usability and referring to previous studies we selected global climate models gcms of each variable for calibration and verification table 2 fig a 3 taylor 2001 zhou and wang 2015 anjum et al 2019 li et al 2019 zhang et al 2021 a taylor diagram the correlation coefficient root mean square error and standard deviation between the simulated and observed values are evaluated the results show that cmip6 has a better and more stable simulation ability for temperature than other variables b multi model ensemble mean mme the simulation effect of mme is better than that of single mode therefore the present study used the mme of all the modes in table 2 to correct the deviation of the original gcm output and reduce the simulation uncertainty 2 3 7 theil sen median trend analysis and mann kendall test theil sen median trend analysis is a robust nonparametric statistical trend calculation method that can reduce the impact of data outliers theil 1950 sen 1968 hoaglin et al 2000 mann kendall is a non parametric statistical test method used to judge the significance of the trend it does not require the sample to obey a certain distribution and is not disturbed by outliers kendall 1975 tosic 2004 the combination of theil sen median trend analysis and the mann kendall test has become an important method for judging the trend of long time series data cai and yu 2009 lunetta et al 2006 milich and weiss 2000 tucker et al 1991 the advantage of this method is that it does not need the data to obey a particular distribution has strong resistance to data errors and has a solid statistical theoretical foundation for the test of significance level making the results more scientific and reliable this present study combines the two research methods to analyze the spatial change characteristics of drought hazards in different agrirezones in different future periods piao and fang 2001 2 3 8 cellular

changes in cultivated land in this study area zhou et al 2012 saeed et al 2022 3 results 3 1 assessment of potato drought hazard the spatial distribution of drought hazards in different months of the potato growth period showed that the areas affected by drought disasters were mainly distributed in the west of z 2 with a large planting area and z 3 fig 3 the spatial distribution of drought hazards which is affected by precipitation sm and vci distribution decreased from west to east cross the study area with the different water requirements of potato in different growth periods the degree of drought damage varied from month to month which is august september july june october and may agricultural drought lags meteorological drought in the growing season potato is drought resistant in the early stage have a large water demand in the middle stage and are vulnerable to waterlogging in the later stage july august and september are the highest water demand periods therefore compared with spring drought prone season july august and september have high values of drought hazard however july august is the rainy season in inner mongolia so the area with a high risk value is less than that in september 3 2 assessment of potato drought vulnerability potato was mainly planted in rain fed agricultural areas with poor irrigation conditions such as the hohhot ulanqab south of baotou and xilingol league in the central region of z 2 the average yield was ranked as z3 z1 z2 the yield of the municipal administrative regions decreased from east to west in the central region according to the yield reduction rate statistics negative values accounted for approximately half of the total number of years the highest was the alxa league 59 and the lowest was hulun buir 43 the actual evapotranspiration of crops increases west to east in the study area the central and southern regions of z2 and the northeast of xing an league of z1 have the highest drought vulnerability fig 4a 3 3 assessment of potato drought exposure prevention and mitigation capacity the planting area of inner mongolia reached 6 7 103 km2 in 2010 after 2010 the planting area decreased because of comprehensive factors such as weather industrial structure adjustment in various production areas and market conditions the average acreage was ranked as z2 z1 z3 ulanqab and hohhot located in z2 have the lowest yield but the highest planting area among the municipal administrative regions fig 5a the average cultivated land area ranked z1 z2 z3 and the cultivated land area of the municipal administrative region decreased from east to west fig 5b the suitability of the agro climatic resources increased from north to south and z1 was better than z2 and z3 fig 5c it can be seen from the comparison that the main planting areas and areas suitable for agro climatic resources do not overlap the trend is in the opposite direction exposure decreased from the central part to the east west with the highest in the central part of ulanqab northeastern hohhot and southern baotou fig 5d the distribution of water resources is uneven and does not adapt to population and cultivated land distribution water resources in z1 accounted for more than 50 of inner mongolia inner mongolia has large differences in resource distribution and industrial structure unbalanced population distribution and economic development and large differences between the backward and developed regions the economy of the z2 region which is dominated by the hohhot baotou ordos economic circle has developed rapidly formed a good agglomeration characteristic and extends to the east west direction of z1 and z3 the average trend yield ranking was z3 z1 z2 the regions with the highest and lowest trend yields in the municipal administrative regions are all in z2 the central and southern parts of z2 have the lowest disaster prevention and reduction capacity but the western part of z2 has the largest irrigation area in the china hetao irrigation area the disaster prevention and mitigation capacity increased from the middle to the east and west fig 4b 3 4 assessment of potato drought risk fig 6 shows that the drought risks of the potato growing season in inner mongolia decreased from the central part to the east and west the extremely high risk area and high risk area are concentrated in the central area of ulanqab the northeast of hohhot and the south of baotou in z2 where potato are widely planted the low risk area is concentrated in the heilongjiang and liao river basins of z1 and the hetao irrigation area of z2 the temporal distribution of drought risk was the same as that of hazard distribution although the drought hazard values were high in july and august the area was smaller than that in september during the deployment of disaster prevention work attention should be paid to the different deployment priorities of the two periods 4 discussion the potato industry in inner mongolia should note that the areas with high drought disaster risk values were areas with high exposure values figs 3 6 however more than 98 of china s agricultural operators are still smallholders and there is a lack of scientific means for potato planting and irrigation management especially in northern china xinhua news agency 2019 changing the current situation of blindly expanding planting areas to increase yield carrying out scientific meteorological disaster prevention and developing efficient and sustainable agriculture are important issues that developing countries including china urgently need to address fan et al 2019 woldeselassie et al 2021 zheng et al 2021 potato is an important pillar of food security strategies and one of the main ways to increase smallholder income china has proposed a potato staple food policy combined with the sickle bay area policy and the western development policy to expand the planting area to help eliminate poverty inner mongolia has also set a high quality development goal for the potato industry breeding varieties and striving to restore the potato planting area to more than 5 0 103 km2 by 2025 people s government of inner mongolia autonomous region 2020 the implementation of these strategies requires that the potato planting distribution and production structure dominated by smallholders fully understand the current problems of planting environment conditions such as agro climatic resources and cultivated land resources bukchin and fishman 2021 escuredo et al 2020 morton 2007 tang et al 2018 tomoko et al 2021 4 1 spatial temporal analysis of potato planting environment conditions exposure is a precondition for disaster subjects to endure natural hazards analysis of the distribution of drought hazard barycenters in different agrirezones fig 7 revealed that potato in inner mongolia were exposed to regions with low suitability of agro climatic resources and high drought hazard values figs 3 and 5 which is one of the main reasons for potato drought disasters in the 80 s and 90 s the barycenters of the z1 drought hazard were mostly concentrated in the southwest and later moved northeast the barycenters of the z2 drought hazard moved from the central and western regions to the northeast and were concentrated in ulanqab bayan nur hohhot and baotou which have the largest potato planting areas the barycenters of the z3 drought hazard shifted from the middle west to the northwest and overlapped in different months in the case where the suitable area of agro climatic resources does not overlap with the main planting area major drought disasters will frequently occur in the concentration area of the drought disaster risk center causing serious losses for example more than 50 days of continuous drought from july to september 2014 reduced the potato total yield in ulanqab by approximately 70 during 2016 inner mongolia suffered from meteorological disasters resulting in a total yield reduction of 1 0 109 kg of potato total yield and a total economic loss of 940 million yuan the dry area in hulun buir in summer was 4 3 102 km2 resulting in a reduction of 2 0 108 kg of potato total yield and economic losses of more than 100 million yuan therefore the non overlap between the suitable area of agro climatic resources and the main planting area is the main reason for potato drought disasters and one of the critical problems facing potato production the lucc results show fig 8 that from 1980 to 2020 the main sources of the increase in cultivated land area in inner mongolia were grassland and woodland this change is conducive to agricultural development but as an essential ecological security barrier in northern china the reduction of inner mongolia grassland and woodland threatens the ecological security of inner mongolia and even north china the total yield of potato in inner mongolia comes from the advantages of z1 high yield and z2 large scale planting the increase in the potato planting area in inner mongolia was mainly concentrated in z2 z1 is one of the main corn producing areas in china and its area is increasing in the next step the increase in potato planting area in inner mongolia can only focus on z2 however the land use type of z2 was mainly woodland and grassland therefore when increasing the potato planting area in inner mongolia we should pay attention to the reasonable planning of lucc and formulate scientific and reasonable policies to ensure the high quality sustainable development of the potato industry and ecological security 4 2 prediction of potato planting environment conditions in the future according to the ipcc 2022 we divided the future period into two periods the near term 2020 2040 and the mid long term 2041 2100 fig 9 shows that the changes in drought hazard in the near and mid long terms have noticeable spatial differences more regions show a decreasing trend in ssp1 2 6 in the near term than in ssp3 7 0 whereas the opposite situation is observed in the mid long term under different scenarios the spatial change in the july drought hazard showed an opposite trend ssp1 2 6 shows an increase decrease situation from east to west whereas ssp3 7 0 shows a decrease increase decrease situation in the near term it should be noted that chifeng in the southwest of z1 south of baotou north of hohhot and the middle of ulanqab in the south of z2 all show a decreasing trend which is the area with the largest planting area in the mid long term most areas showed an increasing trend especially in z2 and southeast of z1 this may exceed the water demand for potato during this growth period under different scenarios the spatial change of the august drought hazard mainly shows no significant increase decrease in the near term however it should be noted that there is a very significant decreasing trend in the southeast of chifeng in z1 and south of xilingol league in z2 which may cause losses to potato in the mid long term except for the northeast region of z1 and some regions of z3 there is an increasing trend at this time the manager should be paid to the drought hazard in the northeast of z1 centered on hulun buir and the possible waterlogging hazard caused by the extremely significant increase in a large area of z2 fig 10 shows the distribution results of cultivated land in 2040 and 2100 china is encouraging and advocating large scale planting hoping to improve the fragmentation of cultivated land dominated by smallholders and improve the efficiency of agricultural output the fragmentation of cultivated land which affects the efficiency and productivity of agricultural production has been improved in the lucc changes in the two periods the increase of cultivated land area is mainly from grassland and woodland this may bring difficulties to grassland ecological protection in inner mongolia and attention should be paid to the balance of occupation and compensation in the near term the cultivated land area increased in z1 whereas z2 and z3 showed a decreasing trend the increased area of z1 is mainly chifeng and tongliao baotou bayan nur and hohhot in z2 show a slightly increasing trend whereas other regions show a decreasing trend in the mid long term the cultivated land area in z1 and z3 shows an increasing trend whereas z2 shows a weak decreasing trend during the two periods the cultivated land area of xilingol league and ulanqab in z2 showed a decreasing trend with a large magnitude according to the lucc results the increase in grassland area is the main reason for the decreased cultivated land area in z2 combined with the drought disaster risk assessment results this result is expected because of the large loss of crop yield caused by long term drought in this region adjusting the land use cover layout this situation is opposite to the overall situation in inner mongolia the inner mongolia government needs to make different arrangements for the development of the overall and local potato industry according to the specific situation this study can provide support for zoning management agrirezones decisions the results showed that the government of inner mongolia must consider the following aspects to develop the potato industry in the future the first was to provide technical assistance to smallholders the second is to develop potato varieties that are tolerant to water shortages and drought the third was to build an agro climatic forecasting platform to prepare for possible meteorological disasters the last step was to ensure detailed and comprehensive data records of potato production in this study we systematically analyzed potato drought disasters in inner mongolia based on the division of the agrirezones although the results of this study are specific to a research region and particular crops the methods used in this study can be used in other regions and crops to monitor agricultural drought disaster risk rather than simple meteorological drought however when considering the impact of this study we should also pay attention to the limitations of the study first this study only considered the suitability of agro climatic resources for planting the second limitation of this study comes from the data limitations for example the yield data comes from the city level and cannot be detailed at the county level the planting area only had statistical data but there was no specific planting location data the data of planting varieties were not specific and relevant disaster loss data were also unavailable this limits the accuracy of the results 5 conclusion the present study based on the spac system constructed a cdci in different months of the potato growing season based on the four factor theory of natural disaster risk formation assessed the drought disaster risk in potato growing seasons in different agrirezones of inner mongolia china july august is the rainwater concentration period in inner mongolia therefore although the drought risk value was high the area was smaller than in september the extremely high risk area and high risk area areas are concentrated in the middle of the z2 area the non overlap of suitable areas of agro climatic resources and main planting areas is an important problem to be solved in potato production and is also the leading cause of drought disasters the drought hazard changes in the near term and mid long term of the future show significant spatiotemporal differences in addition to the near term attention to the persistence of drought hazards in the major growing areas attention must be paid to the possible waterlogging hazard in the mid long term the results also show that the future lucc of inner mongolia is opposite to that of the different agrirezones the cultivated land area in inner mongolia increased however z2 decreased especially in ulanqab which had the largest potato planting area this also demonstrates the necessity of dividing inner mongolia into different agrirezones in the present study in the deployment of disaster prevention work attention should be paid to the other priorities of work deployment in different periods and agrirezones the research results can provide a practical reference for the layout of potato cultivation in inner mongolia improve the regional disaster management capacity and provide new ideas

9203,potato bears the burden of eliminating hunger and supporting food security quantitative assessment of potato drought disaster risk can help the sustainable development of the potato industry and improve the regional disaster management capacity this is also a major and urgent demand for food security this study constructed a comprehensive drought condition index cdci for different months of the potato growing season based on the soil plant atmosphere continuum spac system quantitatively assessed potato drought disaster risk based on the four factor theory of natural disaster risk formation and discussed the historical and future planting environmental conditions in inner mongolia china the results showed that the non overlap between suitable areas of agro climatic resources and main planting areas is the main reason for the occurrence of potato drought disasters and the extremely high risk area and high risk area areas were concentrated in the current main planting areas which was one of the problems encountered in the sustainable development of potato industry in inner mongolia the analysis of future drought hazard changes indicates the need to pay attention not only to the possible persistence of drought hazard in near term but also to the possible waterlogging hazard in mid long term the different situations of land use cover change lucc in inner mongolia and various agricultural resources and environmental zones agrirezones have confirmed the necessity of separating regions for agricultural drought risk analysis and management the present study can be used as a reference for adjusting the layout of the potato industry and provide a basis for agricultural disaster prevention and reduction keywords potato drought risk agricultural resource and environment zoning china data availability the authors do not have permission to share data 1 introduction potato solanum tuberosum l is a perennial herb of the solanaceae family with edible tubers it is the fourth largest food crop in the world after wheat rice and corn the united nations designated 2008 as the international year of the potato calling the potato a buried treasure and calling on the world to focus on the irreplaceable importance of the potato in alleviating the food crisis ensuring food security and achieving the millennium development goals hoekstra 2008 potato is grown in 158 countries and territories worldwide faostat 2018 potato is an essential means of ensuring food security and a major source of income for developing countries and is classified as a strategic reserve food by many countries haas et al 2009 li 1985 zhang et al 2017 chakraborty et al 2010 the 2021 state of food security and nutrition in the world report food and agriculture organization of the united nations fao 2021 estimates that 720 811 million people faced hunger in 2020 a looming catastrophe climate change is regarded as one of the important factors inducing the global food crisis and the frequent occurrence of climate disasters makes it difficult for the international community to achieve the goal of the zero hunger challenge by 2030 significant fluctuations in global agricultural production and increased food supply instability pose a substantial risk to global and regional food security with the intensification of global climate change hijmans 2003 predicted that if adaptation is not considered global potato production will decline by 10 19 in 2010 39 and 18 32 in 2050 raymundo et al 2017 applied future climate change scenarios to current potato cropping systems the global tuber yield decreased slightly 2 to 6 in 2055 and significantly 2 to 26 in 2085 climate change causes extreme weather and precipitation heterogeneity which seriously threaten the food security of agroecosystems suri et al 2021 droughts cause an average of nearly 600 to 8 billion in global economic losses yearly keyantash and dracup 2004 yagci et al 2013 chatterjee et al 2022 agricultural drought has seriously hampered agricultural development in developing countries and is a complex phenomenon worldwide the area of crops affected by drought in china reaches 2 0 105 km2 per year china meteorological administration 2020 china is one of the countries most affected by climate change ipcc 2022 china is the largest potato producer in the world accounting for approximately 1 4 of the world s area and total output wang et al 2019 the potential contribution of potato to china s food self sufficiency is far greater than that of the other three major food crops wang et al 2018 inner mongolia is one of china s top five potato producing provinces ranking among the top three in planted area and total production accounting for more than 10 of china s output drought disaster is one of the main factors restricting the development of the potato industry in inner mongolia jansky et al 2009 wang et al 2021 the frequency and regionality of extreme weather events increase the difficulty of agricultural risk management potato which has rich nutrition good productivity and wide adaptability is one of the most promising crops of the 21st century however current agro meteorological disaster risk research has primarily focused on corn wheat and rice zhang 2004 wassmann et al 2009 julia dingkuhn 2013 zhang et al 2019 2021 li et al 2021a studies on potato drought have focused on its physiology biochemistry and quality for the world s most common and widely distributed natural disaster drought disaster quantitative assessment of the risk can help the sustainable development of the potato industry and improve regional disaster management capacity this is a major and urgent demand for food security at present there are three main views on the formation of natural disaster risk 1 the two factor method of risk formation proposed by okada norio r h v 2 the three factor method of risk formation proposed by tatano hirozazu r h v e 3 by refining the risk theory zhang jiquan put forward a four factors method combining the concept of disaster prevention and mitigation capability with risk formation r h v e 1 c h hazard of disaster e exposure of disaster bearing body v vulnerability of disaster bearing body c disaster prevention and reduction capability guo et al 2016 jia et al 2012 liu et al 2013 un isdr united nations international strategy for disaster reduction 2007 zhang et al 2017 ipcc intergovernmental panel on climate change 2007a began to advocate improving disaster prevention and mitigation capabilities reducing disaster risks summarizing experiences in disaster risk management and seeking ways to adapt to climate change in the context of global warming drought has shown a global normalization trend inner mongolia spans a large area from east to west with significant geographical differences in cultivated land resources agricultural resources and environmental zoning are ways to analyze the characteristics of resource and environmental problems and agricultural production conditions in each region and to propose the spatial layout and development direction for the rational use and protection of agricultural resources and the environment xu 2021 therefore distinguishing agricultural resources and environmental zones and emphasizing the ability of disaster prevention and mitigation to conduct agricultural drought risk analysis can help improve the regional disaster management ability according to local conditions and reduce the potential drought risk under climate change jia et al 2016 drought is usually divided into four types meteorological drought agricultural drought hydrological drought and socio economic drought wilhite and glantz 1985 conventional drought assessment and monitoring usually focus on the meteorological aspects of drought and precipitation and or evapotranspiration data are typically used to establish meteorological drought indices for spatial and temporal monitoring palmer 1965 mckee et al 1993 svoboda et al 2002 guttman 1998 heim 2002 vicente serrano et al 2010 beguería et al 2014 sadri et al 2018 however meteorological drought is not equivalent to agricultural drought agricultural drought is a complex process involving many comprehensive factors such as soil crops atmosphere and human use of resources this is not only a physical process but also related to the biological process of the crop itself wilhite and glantz 1985 keyantash and dracup 2004 rhee et al 2010 martínez fernández et al 2015 leng and hall 2019 chatterjee et al 2022 soil moisture sm dominates the dryness stress of global ecosystem production and is essential for describing and predicting agriculture liu et al 2020 chatterjee et al 2022 potato is a drought tolerant plant with high adaptability and water absorption capacity the flow process of water from the soil through plants to the atmosphere can be studied as a unified dynamic and continuous system this system is called the soil plant atmosphere continuum spac therefore we suggest building a comprehensive drought condition index based on the spac system to reflect regional drought to promote potato drought disaster risk assessment the aim of the present study was to quantitatively evaluate potato drought risk in inner mongolia china based on the four factor theory of natural disaster risk formation the objectives were to 1 construct a cdci for different months of the potato growing season based on the spac system 2 quantitatively assess the drought disaster risk for different months of the potato growing season in different agrirezones of inner mongolia and 3 discuss the changes in the potato planting environment history and future the results of this study can provide a scientific basis for understanding the formation mechanism of potato drought disasters in inner mongolia promote an understanding of potato drought disaster risk in the context of climate change and provide new ideas for sustainable potato production in china and other countries 2 data and methodology 2 1 study area inner mongolia 37 24 53 23 n 97 12 126 04 e fig 1 is located on the northern border of china with a total area of 1 18 106 km² the terrain extends obliquely from northeast to southwest in a narrow shape and the landscape is dominated by the mongolian plateau which has a complex and diverse form the climate is dominated by a temperate continental climate with sufficient sunshine large temperature differences between day and night rain and heat in the same season and low incidence of pests and diseases suitable for potato growth needs the fluctuation rate of the potato yield showed a downward trend during the same period precipitation showed a weak increasing trend the fluctuation rates of potato yield and precipitation in inner mongolia passed the correlation test fig a 1 and the correlation decreased from the middle to the east and west with the highest value of 0 62 this shows that potato yield in inner mongolia is primarily affected by precipitation which is consistent with previous studies wang et al 2021 however inner mongolia has a large span from east to west with pronounced regional differences in cultivated land resources it has formed the central potato industry advantage zone with ulanqab as the center and the eastern potato industry advantage zone with hulun buir as the center the central advantage area mainly focuses on breeding and producing virus free seed potato and developing commercial potato production bases around potato processing enterprises which is one of the economic sources of farmers the eastern advantage area mainly produces green fresh potato and builds a production base of processed potato and virus free seed potato she et al 2012 li guo 2021b therefore this study divides inner mongolia into three regions according to china s agricultural resources and environment zoning dataset xu 2021 1 zone 1 z1 northeast zone 2 zone 2 z2 central zone along the great wall and 3 zone 3 z3 northwest arid zone the main potato varieties in inner mongolia include kexin 1 shepody favorita chahar desiree kangnibek atlantic and

development including seven combination scenarios ssp1 1 9 ssp1 2 6 ssp4 3 4 ssp2 4 5 ssp4 6 0 ssp3 7 0 and ssp5 8 5 we selected two scenarios for comparison the low forcing scenario ssp1 2 6 global warming 1 5 in which the future increase in global forest coverage is accompanied by a large amount of land use change and the medium and high forcing scenario ssp3 7 0 global warming 2 0 in which the future decrease in global forest coverage is accompanied by a large amount of land use change the sustainability model ssp1 2 6 is an updated version of rcp2 6 in the coupled model intercomparison project phase 5 cmip5 the regional rivalry model ssp3 7 0 fills the gap in the high forcing scenarios in cmip5 and emphasizes the sensitivity of local climate change to land use and aerosol forcing these two scenarios apply to scientific research concerning the land use model intercomparison project lumip lucc digital elevation model dem river system and population data were obtained from the

layers according to the soil depth the potato planting in inner mongolia is ridge planting which is beneficial to water conservation and temperature increase the ridge height was 15 30 cm therefore we used sm data from the first layer 0 7 cm 0 cm on the surface surface evapotranspiration equals the sum of evaporation from bare soil the top of the canopy and vegetation transpiration the data on financial support for agriculture came from the inner mongolia statistical yearbook finally all the data were uniformly interpolated into a 0 05 0 05 grid to maintain consistency 2 3 methods 2 3 1 framework for drought disaster risk assessment natural disasters are events in which natural variation exceeds a certain degree and causes losses to human beings and the social economy natural disaster risk can be described as the possibility of adverse consequences or expected losses caused by variations in natural factors blaikie et al 2014 ipcc 2014 wilhite 2000 ipcc 2007b hazard h refers to the degree of natural variation of disaster causing factors determined by the environmental conditions and the scale and frequency of disaster causing activities vulnerability v refers to the degree of damage to a disaster subject which is determined by the disaster sensitivity and adaptability of the crops exposure e refers to the degree of exposure of a disaster subject to disasters which is determined by the actual and potential exposure of crops exposure is a precondition for disaster subjects to endure natural hazards if a disaster subject is not exposed to disasters it does not have to bear them disaster prevention and mitigation capability c refers to the ability to recover from or respond to disasters and is determined by the ability to prevent reduce resist and relieve disasters based on the four factor method of risk formation this study constructed a framework for the quantitative assessment of potato drought disaster risk fig 2 eqs 1 5 one of the main steps in integrating the identified indicators is to assign weights to elucidate their relative contribution to risk formation we obtained the final weights using principal component analysis in a dual overlay of spatial grid and statistical data table evaluation models of the potato drought disaster risk were constructed using the weighted comprehensive average method 1 r h v e 1 c where r is the potato drought disaster risk index the values of h v e and c respectively represent the hazard exposure vulnerability and disaster prevention and reduction ability indices of the potato drought

disaster relief capabilities 2 3 2 comprehensive drought condition index cdci agricultural drought means that in the process of crop growth owing to insufficient precipitation low soil water content and lack of timely and appropriate irrigation the water supply cannot meet the normal water demand of crops rather than a simple meteorological drought based on the comprehensive action mechanism of the spac system the present study integrates meteorological data remote sensing data and reanalysis multi source data and selects the spei vci and smci to build a cdci which is subject to agrirezone zoning resampling and dimensionless processing 8 cd ci w 1 smci 3 w 2 spei 3 w 3 vci where w 1 w 2 and w 3 are the coefficients of smci spei3 and vci table 1 respectively which were obtained by spatial principal component analysis arcgis the vci is used for long term avhrr observation of drought monitoring kogan 1995 and is obtained by scaling ndvi 9 vci ndvi i ndvi min ndvi max ndvi min where ndvi i is the monthly ndvi of position i grid and ndvi min and ndvi max are the minimum and maximum values of the ndvi at position i over the years respectively the smci is the scaled sm sánchez et al 2016 10 smci sm i sm min sm max sm min where sm i is the monthly sm at location i grid sm min and sm max are the minimum and maximum values of sm at position i over the years respectively vicente et al 2010 proposed the spei to monitor and study the drought process in the context of global warming the spei considers the temperature sensitivity of evapotranspiration and has the advantages of multi scale and multi spatial comparison it has been widely used in drought research the classification of the cdci index is based on the three indexes severe drought 0 cdci 0 3 moderate drought 0 3 cdci 0 4 mild drought 0 4 cdci 0 5 and no drought 0 5 cdci the scale and frequency of disaster causing activities were determined by di and df of each level 11 di i 1 n cdci i 12 df n i m i where cdci i is the cdci value of a certain level of drought occurring in i month n is the number of times a certain level of drought occurred in i month and m is the total number of years 2 3 3 analysis of crop yield crop yield is affected by social and natural factors it is typically divided into three parts trend yield climate induced yield and random error zhao et al 2019 maqsood et al 2020 trend yield refers to the long term change trend of crop yield caused by productivity level in social factors climate induced yield refers to the short term fluctuation in crop yield caused by meteorological conditions random error also known as random noise is typically ignored in research extracting climate induced yield from crop yield is the most common method to study the relationship between climatic factors and crop yield 13 y y t y c e 14 y r y y t y t where y is the actual crop yield y t is the trend yield y c is the climate induced yield e is the random yield random noise which is usually ignored y r is the yield fluctuation rate and the year with the negative value is the year of production reduction currently three methods moving average logistic function fitting and hodrick prescott filter hp filter are commonly used to separate the actual crop yield into trend and climate induced yields although the moving average method and logistic function fitting method are simple and easy to operate they both rely on the assumption that the long term change in grain yield tends toward a specific function model the basic assumption of the hp filter model is that time series data can be regarded as a combination of trend and periodic components hodrick and prescott 1997 ahumada garegnani 2000 ravn uhlig 2002 wu zhou 2010 bunnoon et al 2013 this model effectively separates the two parts of the data in this study the actual crop yield was divided into high frequency climate induced yield and low frequency trend yield components by hp filtering tang 2007 zhao et al 2019 the correlation between the trend yield and actual yield of different administrative units obtained by the hp filtering method exceeded 55 and the regression relationship passed the 0 05 significance test table a 1 the results showed that this method could accurately reflect the trend yield and calculate climate induced yield drought is the most common meteorological disaster in inner mongolia occurring almost yearly the cdci index and the yield fluctuation rate of the potato growth period passed the correlation test fig a 2 the present study characterized the drought susceptibility of potato by combining the frequency and magnitude of yield reduction with the establishment of an agro meteorological damage index the yield reduction rate can be divided into mild 5 to 10 moderate 10 to 15 and severe 15 the y r f and gm values were calculated for each grade the absolute value of the sum of the product of y r f and gm is the drought sensitivity of potato 2 3 4 suitability of agro climatic resources combined with the actual situation of inner mongolia meteorological indices in each growth period of potato and relevant test results we determined the temperature suitability precipitation suitability function and sunshine suitability function and obtained comprehensive planting suitability a temperature suitability 15 s t t t 1 t h t b t 0 t 1 t h

temperature upper limit temperature and appropriate temperature required for each growth period of potato respectively the three base point temperatures of potato in each growth period were determined by referring to the corresponding index system and combined with the production practice table a 2 b precipitation suitability 17 r ro s p r ro 18 r ro s p 1 where s p is the precipitation suitability r is the cumulative precipitation in a certain potato development period ro is the crop water demand in each growth period of potato we referred to the standard crop coefficient of 85 crops

selected as the study area and each municipal administrative region was selected as the secondary area specifically the longitude and latitude of the centers of 12 provincial administrative regions were taken as the calculation parameters and the relevant attribute dataset of each administrative region was taken as the calculation attribute value in addition dimensionless processing was performed to ensure the comparability of the data forman 1995 na 2017 analysis of the shift of barycenter by decade 80 s 90 s 00 s and 10 s 23 x t i 1 n s ti x i i 1 n s ti 24 y t i 1 n s ti y i i 1 n

impact of data outliers theil 1950 sen 1968 hoaglin et al 2000 mann kendall is a non parametric statistical test method used to judge the significance of the trend it does not require the sample to obey a certain distribution and is not disturbed by outliers kendall 1975 tosic 2004 the combination of theil sen median trend analysis and the mann kendall test has become an important method for judging the trend of long time series data cai and yu 2009 lunetta et al 2006 milich and weiss 2000 tucker et al 1991 the advantage of this method is that it does not need the data to obey a particular distribution has strong resistance to data errors and has a solid statistical theoretical foundation for the test of significance level making the results more scientific and reliable this

potato growth period showed that the areas affected by drought disasters were mainly distributed in the west of z 2 with a large planting area and z 3 fig 3 the spatial distribution of drought hazards which is affected by precipitation sm and vci distribution decreased from west to east cross the study area with the different water requirements of potato in different growth periods the degree of drought damage varied from month to month which is august september july june october and may agricultural drought lags meteorological drought in the growing season potato is drought resistant in the early stage have a large water demand in the middle stage and are vulnerable to waterlogging in the later stage july august and september are the highest water demand periods therefore compared with spring drought prone season july august and september have high values of drought hazard however july august is the rainy season in inner mongolia so the area with a high risk value is less than that in september 3 2 assessment of potato drought vulnerability potato was mainly planted in rain fed agricultural areas with poor irrigation conditions such as the hohhot ulanqab south of baotou and xilingol league in the central region of z 2 the average yield was ranked as z3 z1 z2 the yield of the municipal administrative regions decreased from east to west in the central region according to the yield reduction rate statistics negative values accounted for approximately half of the total number of years the highest was the alxa league 59 and the lowest was hulun buir 43 the actual evapotranspiration of crops increases west to east in the study area the central and southern regions of z2 and the northeast of xing an league of z1 have the highest drought vulnerability fig 4a 3 3 assessment of potato drought exposure prevention and mitigation capacity the planting area of inner mongolia reached 6 7 103 km2 in 2010 after 2010 the planting area decreased because of comprehensive factors such as weather industrial structure adjustment in various production areas and market conditions the average acreage was ranked as z2 z1 z3 ulanqab and hohhot located in z2 have the lowest yield but the highest planting area among the municipal administrative regions fig 5a the average cultivated land area ranked z1 z2 z3 and the cultivated land area of the municipal administrative region decreased from east to west fig 5b the suitability of the agro climatic resources increased from north to south and z1 was better than z2 and z3 fig 5c it can be seen from the comparison that the main planting areas and areas suitable for agro climatic resources do not overlap the trend is in the opposite direction exposure decreased from the central part to the east west with the highest in the central part of ulanqab northeastern hohhot and southern baotou fig 5d the distribution of water resources is uneven and does not adapt to population and cultivated land distribution water resources in z1 accounted for more than 50 of inner mongolia inner mongolia has large differences in resource distribution and industrial structure unbalanced population distribution and economic development and large differences between the backward and developed regions the economy of the z2 region which is dominated by the hohhot baotou ordos economic circle has developed rapidly formed a good agglomeration characteristic and extends to the east west direction of z1 and z3 the average trend yield ranking was z3 z1 z2 the regions with the highest and lowest trend yields in the municipal administrative regions are all in z2 the central and southern parts of z2 have the lowest disaster prevention and reduction capacity but the western part of z2 has the largest irrigation area in the china hetao irrigation area the disaster prevention and mitigation capacity increased from the middle to the east and west fig 4b 3 4 assessment of potato drought risk fig 6 shows that the drought risks of the potato growing season in inner mongolia decreased from the central part to the east and west the extremely high risk area and high risk area are concentrated in the central area of ulanqab the northeast of hohhot and the south of baotou in z2 where potato are widely planted the low risk area is concentrated in the heilongjiang and liao river basins of z1 and the hetao irrigation area of z2 the temporal distribution of drought risk was the same as that of hazard distribution although the drought hazard values were high in july and august the area was smaller than that in september during the deployment of disaster prevention work attention should be paid to the different deployment priorities of the two periods 4 discussion the potato industry in inner mongolia should note that the areas with high drought disaster risk values were areas with high exposure values figs 3 6 however more than 98 of china s agricultural operators are still smallholders and there is a lack of scientific means for potato planting and irrigation management especially in northern china xinhua news agency 2019 changing the current situation of blindly expanding planting areas to increase yield carrying out scientific meteorological disaster prevention and developing efficient and sustainable agriculture are important issues that developing countries including china urgently need to address fan et al 2019 woldeselassie et al 2021 zheng et al 2021 potato is an important pillar of food security strategies and one of the main ways to increase smallholder income china has proposed a potato staple food policy combined with the sickle bay area policy and the western development policy to expand the planting area to help eliminate poverty inner mongolia has also set a high quality development goal for the potato industry breeding varieties and striving to restore the potato planting area to more than 5 0 103 km2 by 2025 people s government of inner mongolia autonomous region 2020 the implementation of these strategies requires that the potato planting distribution and production structure dominated by smallholders fully understand the current problems of planting environment conditions such as agro climatic resources and cultivated land resources bukchin and fishman 2021 escuredo et al 2020 morton 2007 tang et al 2018 tomoko et al 2021 4 1 spatial temporal analysis of potato planting environment conditions exposure is a precondition for disaster subjects to endure natural hazards analysis of the distribution of drought hazard barycenters in different agrirezones fig 7 revealed that potato in inner mongolia were exposed to regions with low suitability of agro climatic resources and high drought hazard values figs 3 and 5 which is one of the main reasons for potato drought disasters in the 80 s and 90 s the barycenters of the z1 drought hazard were mostly concentrated in the southwest and later moved northeast the barycenters of the z2 drought hazard moved from the central and western regions to the northeast and were concentrated in ulanqab bayan nur hohhot and baotou which have the largest potato planting areas the barycenters of the z3 drought hazard shifted from the middle west to the northwest and overlapped in different months in the case where the suitable area of agro climatic resources does not overlap with the main planting area major drought disasters will frequently occur in the concentration area of the drought disaster risk center causing serious losses for example more than 50 days of continuous drought from july to september 2014 reduced the potato total yield in ulanqab by approximately 70 during 2016 inner mongolia suffered from meteorological disasters resulting in a total yield reduction of 1 0 109 kg of potato total yield and a total economic loss of 940 million yuan the dry area in hulun buir in summer was 4 3 102 km2 resulting in a reduction of 2 0 108 kg of potato total yield and economic losses of more than 100 million yuan therefore the non overlap between the suitable area of agro climatic resources and the main planting area is the main reason for potato drought disasters and one of the critical problems facing potato production the lucc results show fig 8 that from 1980 to 2020 the main sources of the increase in cultivated land area in inner mongolia were grassland and woodland this change is conducive to agricultural development but as an essential ecological security barrier in northern china the reduction of inner mongolia grassland and woodland threatens the ecological security of inner mongolia and even north china the total yield of potato in inner mongolia comes from the advantages of z1 high yield and z2 large scale planting the increase in the potato planting area in inner mongolia was mainly concentrated in z2 z1 is one of the main corn producing areas in china and its area is increasing in the next step the increase in potato planting area in inner mongolia can only focus on z2 however the land use type of z2 was mainly woodland and grassland therefore when increasing the potato planting area in inner mongolia we should pay attention to the reasonable planning of lucc and formulate scientific and reasonable policies to ensure the high quality sustainable development of the potato industry and ecological security 4 2 prediction of potato planting environment conditions in the future according to the ipcc 2022 we divided the future period into two periods the near term 2020 2040 and the mid long term 2041 2100 fig 9 shows that the changes in drought hazard in the near and mid long terms have noticeable spatial differences more regions show a decreasing trend in ssp1 2 6 in the near term than in ssp3 7 0 whereas the opposite situation is observed in the mid long term under different scenarios the spatial change in the july drought hazard showed an opposite trend ssp1 2 6 shows an increase decrease situation from east to west whereas ssp3 7 0 shows a decrease increase decrease situation in the near term it should be noted that chifeng in the southwest of z1 south of baotou north of hohhot and the middle of ulanqab in the south of z2 all show a decreasing trend which is the area with the largest planting area in the mid long term most areas showed an increasing trend especially in z2 and southeast of z1 this may exceed the water demand for potato during this growth period under different scenarios the spatial change of the august drought hazard mainly shows no significant increase decrease in the near term however it should be noted that there is a very significant decreasing trend in the southeast of chifeng in z1 and south of xilingol league in z2 which may cause losses to potato in the mid long term except for the northeast region of z1 and some regions of z3 there is an increasing trend at this time the manager should be paid to the drought hazard in the northeast of z1 centered on hulun buir and the possible waterlogging hazard caused by the extremely significant increase in a large area of z2 fig 10 shows the distribution results of cultivated land in 2040 and 2100 china is encouraging and advocating large scale planting hoping to improve the fragmentation of cultivated land dominated by smallholders and improve the efficiency of agricultural output the fragmentation of cultivated land which affects the efficiency and productivity of agricultural production has been improved in the lucc changes in the two periods the increase of cultivated land area is mainly from grassland and woodland this may bring difficulties to grassland ecological protection in inner mongolia and attention should be paid to the balance of occupation and compensation in the near term the cultivated land area increased in z1 whereas z2 and z3 showed a decreasing trend the increased area of z1 is mainly chifeng and tongliao baotou bayan nur and hohhot in z2 show a slightly increasing trend whereas other regions show a decreasing trend in the mid long term the cultivated land area in z1 and z3 shows an increasing trend whereas z2 shows a weak decreasing trend during the two periods the cultivated land area of xilingol league and ulanqab in z2 showed a decreasing trend with a large magnitude according to the lucc results the increase in grassland area is the main reason for the decreased cultivated land area in z2 combined with the drought disaster risk assessment results this result is expected because of the large loss of crop yield caused by long term drought in this region adjusting the land use cover layout this situation is opposite to the overall situation in inner mongolia the inner mongolia government needs to make different arrangements for the development of the overall and local potato industry according to the specific situation this study can provide support for zoning management agrirezones decisions the results showed that the government of inner mongolia must consider the following aspects to develop the potato industry in the future the first was to provide technical assistance to smallholders the second is to develop potato varieties that are tolerant to water shortages and drought the third was to build an agro climatic forecasting platform to prepare for possible meteorological disasters the last step was to ensure detailed and comprehensive data records of potato production in this study we systematically analyzed potato drought disasters in inner mongolia based on the division of the agrirezones although the results of this study are specific to a research region and particular crops the methods used in this study can be used in other regions and crops to monitor agricultural drought disaster risk rather than simple meteorological drought however when considering the impact of this study we should also pay attention to the limitations of the study first this study only considered the suitability of agro climatic resources for planting the second limitation of this study comes from the data limitations for example the yield data comes from the city level and cannot be detailed at the county level the planting area only had statistical data but there was no specific planting location data the data of planting varieties were not specific and relevant disaster loss data were also unavailable this limits the accuracy of the results 5 conclusion the present study based on the spac system constructed a cdci in different months of the potato growing season based on the four factor theory of natural disaster risk formation assessed the drought disaster risk in potato growing seasons in different agrirezones of inner mongolia china july august is the rainwater concentration period in inner mongolia therefore although the drought risk value was high the area was smaller than in september the extremely high risk area and high risk area areas are concentrated in the middle of the z2 area the non overlap of suitable areas of agro climatic resources and main planting areas is an important problem to be solved in potato production and is also the leading cause of drought disasters the drought hazard changes in the near term and mid long term of the future show significant spatiotemporal differences in addition to the near term attention to the persistence of drought hazards in the major growing areas attention must be paid to the possible waterlogging hazard in the mid long term the results also show that the future lucc of inner mongolia is opposite to that of the different agrirezones the cultivated land area in inner mongolia increased however z2 decreased especially in ulanqab which had the largest potato planting area this also demonstrates the necessity of dividing inner mongolia into different agrirezones in the present study in the deployment of disaster prevention work attention should be paid to the other priorities of work deployment in different periods and agrirezones the research results can provide a practical reference for the layout of potato cultivation in inner mongolia improve the regional disaster management capacity and provide new ideas

9204,sugarcane planting is the largest cash crop industry in guangxi and plays an essential role in national sugar security however as the climate warms in recent years agricultural drought has occurred frequently and repeatedly in guangxi including drought in 2009 2010 extreme warm and dry created a shortage of water resources resulting in a severe reduction in sugarcane production in guangxi and a large gap in the sugar market our study used the standardized precipitation evapotranspiration index spei to identify and monitor sugarcane drought disasters in guangxi analyze the impact of long term warming on drought in different sugarcane growth periods caused by precipitation deficits and explore the change in sugarcane drought exposure under climate change 1 based on historical climate observations warmth and precipitation deficits co occurred and the possibility of drought in the sugarcane growth stage was 100 we found that although the probability of precipitation deficit did not change substantially in sugarcane the occurrence of seeding and maturity stage drought years was greater in the past 30 years than in the preceding 28 in addition the different growth periods of sugarcane also exhibited more warming characteristics 2 the multi model ensemble reveal that climate warming has increased the probability of drought years are also warmer in all sugarcane growing seasons with the highest incidence of drought occurring during the seeding tillering and maturity stage as the forced emission scenario is strengthened the probability of precipitation deficits and warm conditions occurring simultaneously will increase as will the probability of warming induced drought 3 under the warming scenario the sugarcane drought affected areas are gradually expanding which could result in the current highly suitable sugarcane planting areas reach the drought tolerance limit from stem elongation to whole growth period drought occurrence increases as latitude decreases in addition the risk of short term drought risk of sugarcane becomes more challenging especially the drought in the mature period which may become the main limiting factor in achieving a high yield of sugarcane in this region keywords drought climate extremes sugarcane event attribution cmip6 data availability no data was used for the research described in the article 1 introduction drought is a major risk component in cropping systems globally with substantial economic loss kim et al 2019 livelihood impacts shiferaw et al 2014 miyan 2015 and ultimately health risks phalkey et al 2015 cooper et al 2019 the first part of the sixth assessment report of the intergovern mental panel on climate change ipcc pointed out that the global surface temperature continued to rise with an increase of about 1 1 compared with 1850 1990 tollefson 2021 as the global climate becomes warmer drought disasters may become more frequent and serious in the future tegegne et al 2019 yang et al 2022 this would profoundly impact various sectors particularly agriculture shen et al 2019 since extreme events threaten global food security lesk et al 2016 agricultural drought is mainly caused by precipitation deficit li et al 2017 high temperatures and high evapotranspiration jiang and luo 2021 which results in insufficient soil water during the crop growth season since 1980 the temperatures of major agricultural countries have gradually increased and drought events have further strengthened the negative impacts on plant growth physiology and fertility lobell et al 2011 zhu et al 2021 sugarcane is a perennial tropical and subtropical grass that is the raw material for making sucrose and can be refined into ethanol as an energy substitute austin et al 1978 sindhu et al 2016 tayt sohn et al 2018 the growing environment of sugarcane requires sufficient solar radiation and rainfall so it is well adapted to the climatic conditions from 30 north latitude to 30 south latitude in the world lovett and lazenby 1979 china s sugar industry is mainly distributed in south with a scale of approximately 1 5 million hectares li and yang 2015 huang et al 2006 the sugarcane industry in guangxi is the most influential and advantageous in china its planting area accounts for more than 60 of the country and its sugar output accounts for 70 it has contributed approximately 7 billion us dollars to the gdp ranking first in the country li and yang 2015 wang et al 2019 zhu et al 2007 the growth rate yield and sugar content of sugarcane are closely related to temperature and precipitation in guangxi the annual average temperature during the whole growth period is required to be approximately 24 and the annual rainfall 1200 mm however different growth stages have different requirements for temperature conditions the minimum temperature at the seeding stage is 13 and the optimum temperature is 30 32 the daily average temperature at tillering stage shall be 20 and the optimum temperature for the stem elongation stage is 25 30 the elongation was inhibited when the temperature is higher than 34 the elongation was slow when the temperature was lower than 20 the elongation stops when the temperature is lower than 10 low temperatures and large daily range during the maturity stage are conducive to sugar accumulation su et al 2006 in addition rainfall dependent dryland agricultural systems are strongly affected by rainfall during the crop growth stage which determines whether agricultural drought will occur zhang et al 2016 compared with the production in other sugar producing areas in the world more than 80 of the sugarcane fields are distributed on slopes that depend on rainfall li and wei 2006 however under the background of global warming the originally humid areas in southern china may face a drying trend which is an important factor leading to the reduction in sugarcane production in guangxi during the severe drought period guangxi is currently suffering from the once in a century drought which has extremely high temperatures and extremely low precipitation occurred causing extreme drought anomaly monthly average spei

2019 the direct cause of the precipitation deficit is an anomaly of the general circulation system and global warming may increase the possibility of this situation although the reasons and historical background of the decrease in precipitation have been discussed in depth the impact of historical temperature changes on individual drought probabilities in different growth periods of crops has not been widely studied lu et al 2011 wang et al 2015 verma et al 2019 yang et al 2020 although precipitation deficits are a prerequisite for water shortage constituting drought dai 2011 higher temperatures amplify the evaporation demand thus increasing the overall drought intensity and impact dai 2013 diffenbaugh et al 2015 quantified the probability of precipitation deficits and

comprehensive loss of dry crops in south china qiang et al 2018 summarized the trends of drought occurrence and agricultural yield decline and clarified that agriculture in southern china is more sensitive to temperature change yang et al 2020 used long term meteorological data and a neural network model to analyze the impact of precipitation and temperature models on agricultural drought in china in addition research on sugarcane mainly includes the impact of extreme climate events such as drought on sugarcane production santillán fernández et al 2016 liang et al 2020 linnenluecke et al 2020 climatic suitability analysis of sugarcane expansion tayt sohn et al 2018 ruan et al 2018 sugarcane can be used as bio energy to mitigate climate change loarie et al 2011 spera et al 2017 however there are few studies on the impact of the interaction between temperature rise and rainfall on drought during different growth periods of sugarcane under climate change research shows that the aggregate combination of extremely high temperatures and very low precipitation during the 2010 2011 event is the most severe in over a century which has severely impacted sugarcane production such as large sugar crop failure and economic losses li et al 2019 guga et al 2021 because the severity of drought and warmth coincide we have considered whether long term warming has altered the probability that precipitation deficits yield extreme drought in sugarcane growing season therefore based on historical meteorological observation data and global climate model gcm data this study used the standardized precipitation evapotranspiration index spei to quantify sugarcane drought disasters in guangxi fully considering that extremely warm and dry conditions are important factors of sugarcane drought and analyzed the possibility of long term warming and precipitation deficits to drought in different growth periods of sugarcane in guangxi on this basis the drought exposure of sugarcane in guangxi in the context climate change is further discussed its primary purpose is to 1 identify and quantify the indicators of sugarcane drought in guangxi and to realize dynamic monitoring and prediction of disasters 2 analyze temporal and spatial characteristics of the precipitation deficit and abnormal temperature during the sugarcane growth stage 3 identify the contribution of abnormal temperature and precipitation changes to drought occurrence probability and 4 discuss changes in sugarcane drought exposure under the global warming this study can improve the understanding of the impact of climate warming on drought caused by precipitation deficit in different growth periods of sugarcane in guangxi and provide a reference for formulating regional adaptation and disaster reduction strategies 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area guangxi is located from 104 26 112 04 e to 20 54 26 24 fig 1 and belongs to a typical subtropical monsoon climate zone guangxi crops include grain and cash crops among which cash crops are famous for planting sugarcane the entire sugarcane growth period requires abundant hydrothermal conditions generally the annual average temperature is 18 30 and the annual rainfall is 1200 mm the guangxi s terrain is complex and variable it is primarily composed of mountains hills and plains the highest altitude is 2800 m agricultural resources are widely developed in lowland and plain areas wang et al 2019 sugarcane is mainly planted in hilly basins and semi mountainous slopes with relatively shallow farming layers which belongs to typical rain fed dry farming tong et al 2018 huang et al 2020 in addition there is a wide range of karst landforms in guangxi the water in karst landforms infiltrates quickly and the surface water storage capacity is weak which can easily cause surface drought karst landforms in the main sugarcane producing areas are widely distributed so it is easier to form droughts than in the surrounding areas wang et al 2010 2 2 data 2 2 1 climate data in our study historical daily observation data of meteorological stations were obtained from the national meteorological information center http data cma cn including daily rainfall maximum and minimum temperature wind speed relative humidity and sunshine hours from 1960 to 2019 it is generated through sorting computing and spatial interpolation the monthly grid data from the national earth system science data center national science technology infrastructure of china http www geodata cn peng et al 2019 mainly included the monthly average temperature and monthly precipitation from 1960 to 2019 with a spatial resolution of 0 5 0 5 it is convenient to calculate the sugarcane drought index and unify the spatial resolution of daily data and monthly data to 0 05 0 05 to analyze the possible impact of climate change on sugarcane growth in the future we obtained simulation data of monthly temperature and precipitation 1960 2100 from 24 global climate models in phase 6 of the coupled model mutual comparison project cmip6 table 1 relevant studies have proven that these global climate models have good simulation ability in china through the calculation and analysis of relative error and root mean square error song et al 2021 zhao et al 2021 song and yan 2022 cmip6 integrates the scientific combination scenarios of shared socioeconomic paths ssps and representative concentrated paths rcps into the impact of socioeconomic development including seven combination scenarios ssp1 1 9 ssp1 2 6 ssp4 3 4 ssp2 4 5 ssp4 6 0 ssp3 7 0 and ssp5 8 5 we selected the ssp1 2 6 ssp2 4 5 and ssp5 8 5 climate scenarios representing low emission forcing medium emission forcing and high emission forcing scenarios respectively veronika et al 2016 msa and yi 2021 arunrat et al 2022 because the spatial resolution of the 24 global climate models was different we used all grid points overlapping with the geographical boundary of guangxi to calculate the temperature and precipitation values at the local resolution of each model finally we used the bilinear interpolation method to unify the spatial resolution of the data to 0 05 0 05 which is convenient for calculating the average of the model set and calculating abnormal climate events 2 2 2 crop data to analyze and quantify the impact of climate anomalies on sugarcane yield under climate warming data on sugarcane yield and sowing area at the city county level were obtained from the data sets of the guangxi statistics bureau http tjj gxzf gov cn and statistical yearbooks of various cities the obtained data were processed into the same units mt ha between 1960 and 2019 owing to the different lengths of sugarcane production records in each county we decided to exclude counties with missing data over five consecutive years 2 3 methods 2 3 1 calculation of drought index vicente serrano et al 2010 proposed a spei as a meteorological drought index the spei is superior to other drought indices in estimating the impact of drought on crop production vicente serrano et al 2010 2012 wang et al 2016 peña gallardo et al 2019 therefore the spei has been widely used to analyze the impact of meteorological drought on agricultural production at regional and global scales shi and tao 2014 to analyze the drought change characteristics of sugarcane in different growth periods under the background of global warming we used the spei as the sugarcane drought monitoring index presently the most commonly used methods to calculate et0 are the penman monteith and thornthwatie methods the penman monteith method is based on a physical process that uses humidity air pressure wind speed and radiation for calculation and is relatively accurate compared with the penman monteith method the data required by the thornthwatie method are easy to obtain and have been widely used in calculating et0 in china therefore we calculated the spei index based on the thornthwaite and penman monteith methods to screen the calculation methods suitable for this study 1 et 0 model a thornthwaite et 0 model 1 et 0 16 k 10 t i h a where t i is the monthly average temperature h is the annual

β 1 where α is the scale parameter β is the shape parameter γ is the origin parameter which is obtained using the linear matrix method f x is the cumulative probability distribution function for a given timescale 4 the corresponding spei is calculated by 8 spei w c 0 c 1 w c 2 w 2 1 d 1 w d 2 w 2 d 3 w 3 9 w 2 ln p where c 0 2 515517 c 1 0 802853 c 2 0 010328 d 1 1 432788 d 2 0 189269 d 3 0

precipitation and abnormal temperature climate anomaly refers to a situation in which the climate deviates from the average climate state currently anomalies temperature and anomaly percentages precipitation are mainly used to quantitatively characterize the degree of climate deviation from the average state liu et al 2010 zhou et al 2017 using historical meteorological observations and cmip6 data we calculated the simulated temperature and precipitation time series for different sugarcane growth periods in guangxi from each observed or simulated time series we calculated ① the average value and percentage deviation of different growth periods of sugarcane in the record length ② the annual abnormal value of the average value of different growth periods of sugarcane and ③ the standard deviation s of the time series of different growth periods of sugarcane according to the world meteorological organization wmo classification criteria for climate anomalies climate anomalies refer to the presence of only one rare meteorological phenomenon over more than 25 years if the overall distribution is a positive probability distribution that is when the absolute deviation exceeds twice the standard deviation the element is considered abnormal we comprehensively considered the calculation method of diffenbaugh et al 2015 and liu et al 2010 for abnormal values and considered that the absolute value of the temperature anomaly in different growth periods of sugarcane exceeded the standard deviation as the standard for the occurrence of warm years if the percentage of precipitation anomaly was less than 20 it was considered the year of precipitation deficit 2 3 3 calculation of frequency of drought abnormal precipitation and abnormal temperature drought frequency yang et al 2022 abnormal rainfall and temperature anomaly frequency refer to the ratio of abnormal climate events at a particular growth stage to the total number of years in a statistical period and can generally represent the frequency of disasters in this study according to the grade standards of drought insufficient rainfall and abnormal temperature if one of the above standards for drought abnormal rainfall and abnormal temperature is met in the grids of different growth periods of sugarcane it will be recorded as 1 otherwise it will be recorded as 0 the total number of occurrences in each grid was the sum of the annual occurrences in the different growth periods during the study period 2 3 4 calculation of climatic yield and yield fluctuation generally the agricultural output process is mainly affected by climatic social science and technological factors only by obtaining meteorological output can we study the impact of climate change on crop output more accurately currently the commonly used methods for extracting crop trend yields include the moving average method linear regression method and hp filtering method potopová et al 2015 peña gallardo et al 2019 li et al 2020 in this study taking the 58 year long time series yield data of sugarcane in guangxi province as an example the sliding average method linear regression method and hp filtering method are used to extract the trend yield by analyzing and evaluating the rationality of the trend yield and meteorological yield separated by the three methods that is considering the fluctuation rate of the trend yield fig 2 and the correlation with the actual yield table 3 the hp filtering method was determined to be the most appropriate method for extracting the trend yield of sugarcane therefore to eliminate the output growth trend caused by non climate factors such as farmland management technology we use the hp filtering method to de trend sugarcane output data and generate meteorological output in metric t ha 10 y c y y t where y is the sugarcane yield per unit area y t is the trend yield y c is the meteorological yield which is the fluctuating output component affected by climatic factors and reflects the favorable or unfavorable climatic conditions and their impact on the output year by year the yield fluctuation can be calculated as follows 11 y r y y t y t where y r denotes the output fluctuation rate the year in which the yield fluctuation rate is negative is the production reduction year and the size is the production reduction rate the general yield fluctuation rate can be expressed as a percentage of the actual yield deviating from the trend yield 2 3 5 taylor diagram and multi model ensemble generally the correlation coefficient r root mean square error rmse and standard deviation sd of the simulated and observed datasets are used to evaluate the simulation ability of cmip models zhu et al 2019 qin et al 2021 the taylor chart can provide a more comprehensive evaluation of the simulation ability of various gcms models huang et al 2022 which can display the r rmse and sd of the simulation and observation datasets in the polar graph when the distance between the model point and observation point was shorter the distance to the origin was closer to 1 and the correlation coefficient was larger in short the closer it is to the observation point the stronger the simulation energy of the model karl and taylor 2001 in addition relevant studies have proven that the simulation ability of a multi model ensemble mme is better than that of a single mode zhu et al 2020 therefore we performed ensemble averaging on the 24 gcms using the equal weight method 3 results 3 1 simulation verification of drought index because precipitation and reference crop evapotranspiration are considered in the calculation of spei it is outstanding in research on agricultural drought vicente serrano et al 2010 however spei indices calculated using different formulas are different we calculated the spei index based on the thornthwaite and penman monteith methods through fitting and comparison we found that the pearson correlation coefficient was 0 93 and the degree of fitting was very high fig 3c in addition we note that the spatial distribution of spei calculated based on the thornthwaite method and penman monteith method in the sugarcane growth stage are also similar fig 3 a b therefore considering the multiple sources and availability of global climate model data we selected the spei index based on the thornthwaite method for the analysis of this study the identification and quantification of agrometeorological disasters must be analyzed with crop yield therefore to further test the drought index used in this study based on the theory of natural disaster formation we multiplied the frequency and intensity of drought in the study area to obtain the drought risk assessment model second correlation and regression analyses were conducted between the average yield reduction rate of the 25 representative stations and the sugarcane drought risk index obtained by the risk assessment model during the study period 1989 2019 fig 3d as shown in the figure there was a significant positive correlation between the drought risk value and sugarcane yield reduction rate the r square is 0 641 a significance test of 0 01 showed that the higher the drought risk value the greater the sugarcane yield reduction rate therefore the spei adopted in this study can better reflect the drought situation of sugarcane in guangxi in addition through historical meteorological observation data we found that the abnormal years of monthly precipitation and temperature used to calculate the drought index were consistent with typical years of sugarcane yield reduction fig 2 fig 5 1977 2000 2009 2011 and 2014 were the years of serious yield reduction especially 2009 2010 was the year when guangxi suffered a drought once in a century which caused severe damage to sugarcane production in the growth stage of sugarcane insufficient precipitation and abnormally high temperatures occurred during the year of severe yield reduction the results showed that the drought index temperature and precipitation were closely related to fluctuations in sugarcane yield 3 2 climate model capability assessment we objectively evaluated the simulation ability of the 24 cmip6 climate models and mme on the average temperature and precipitation in the leading sugarcane producing areas in guangxi using a taylor chart and then calculated the correlation coefficient standard error and rmse between the simulated and observed values of the monthly average temperature and monthly cumulative precipitation in the leading sugarcane producing areas from 1960 to 2015 and reflected all the information in the taylor chart fig 4 the color shapes in the figure correspond to the 24 climate patterns and one mme and the red dots on the horizontal axis represent the observed values the simulation ability of the model is stronger when the model point is closer to the observation point in fig 4 a the temperature correlation coefficient between each model and the observed value is between 0 85 and 0 96 which has good simulation ability however mme has an outstanding ability to simulate the air temperature with a correlation coefficient of 0 97 p 0 01 and its sd and rmse are also closest to the observed values indicating that mme can better simulate the air temperature in the study area from fig 4 b it is easy to see that compared with the temperature the simulation ability of precipitation is lower but the same mme has the best simulation ability of precipitation with a correlation coefficient of 0 84 p 0 01 the mme has the best simulation ability for temperature and precipitation with correlation coefficients greater than 0 8 the sd and rmse are also close to the observed values indicating that the mme can better simulate temperature and precipitation in the study area therefore we realized the affirmation and selection of mme through the optimal results of taylor diagram simulation 3 3 temporal and spatial variation of abnormal climate events in sugarcane production under climate change 3 3 1 temporal variation of abnormal temperature precipitation deficits and drought in the historical period because sugarcane has a fixed growth cycle which can be divided into the seeding stage march to april tillering stage may stem elongation stage june to october maturity stage november and entire growth period march to november we focused on spei temperature and average precipitation in guangxi during the critical growth period of sugarcane fig 5 we found that in the seeding stage the probability of drought occurrence in 1990 2019 was approximately twice that in 1961 1989 three droughts occurred in 1962 1989 accounted for 10 six droughts occurred in 1990 2019 accounted for 20 the increased drought years also impacted the probability of precipitation anomalies 20 in 1961 1889 and 26 in 1990 2019 fig 5a1 compared with 1961 1989 the frequency of precipitation deficits in dry years decreased over the past 30 years fig 5b1 in contrast in the tillering stage the probability of drought in 1990 2019 was approximately half of that in 1961 1989 seven droughts in 1962 1989 accounted for 24 three droughts in 1990 2019 accounted for 10 however the probability of precipitation deficits in the years with precipitation deficits and the years with precipitation deficits in the dry years showed an increasing trend fig 5a2 b2 indicating the probability of drought in the tillering period of sugarcane was still high from fig 5 a3 b3 it is clear that the long term drought frequency of stem extension is low and the drought occurrence year is synchronous with the year of precipitation deficits it is worth noting that in all growth stages the drought frequency of the sugarcane maturity stage was the highest and the drought trend was significantly increased eight droughts occurred in 1962 1989 accounted for 28 11 droughts occurred in 1990 2019 accounted for 37 of the whole year fig 5a4 in addition the coincidence between the abnormal precipitation and drought years was also the highest fig 5b4 however drought frequency was the lowest during the entire sugarcane growth period from 1961 2019 only two droughts occurred similarly the number of abnormal precipitation years was extremely low the observation records show that the year of drought is highly consistent with the year of precipitation deficit indicating that less precipitation is the premise of drought when these precipitation deficiencies occur during warm years they are more likely to produce drought it is not difficult to find that in different growth periods of sugarcane most drought years occur in years with high temperatures fig 5c1 c5 however in the case of precipitation deficits and high temperatures the occurrence rate in dry years can reach 100 fig 5a1 a5 the occurrence rate of warm dry years increased significantly during the maturity period of sugarcane which led to a significant increase in dry years 13 in 1962 1989 27 in 1990 2019 fig 5a4 at the same time we have also captured the phenomenon that occurs in dry years in warm dry years compared with cold dry years and the trend of increasing year by year the increase in drought risk during the sugarcane growth period occurred when the occurrence of low precipitation years lacked substantial change in contrast the increase in warm conditions led to a general increase in the temperature of sugarcane during different growth periods fig 5a c which also showed that the main sugarcane production areas in guangxi were affected by climate warming compared to 1961 1989 in the past 30 years the occurrence of abnormally high temperatures has significantly increased in all growth stages of sugarcane seeding stage 14 17 tillering stage 14 20 stem elongation stage 3 23 maturity stage 10 26 whole growth period 3 30 in contrast the frequency of abnormally low temperatures significantly decreased fig 5a1 a4 therefore the observed warming of the sugarcane growth period to a certain extent increases the possibility that precipitation deficits occur in warm years 3 3 2 temporal variation of abnormally high temperature precipitation deficits and drought in the future period we used the mme of cmip6 to estimate ssp1 2 6 at different growth stages of sugarcane in guangxi ssp2 4 5 occurrence of drought dry and warm years under the ssp5 8 5 scenario fig 6 the results showed that in different sugarcane growth periods the simulated annual frequency of drought was similar to the historical observation records the high frequency of drought was mainly concentrated in the seeding tillering and maturity stages whereas the frequency of drought in the stem elongation stage and the whole growth period was lower especially in the ssp1 2 6 scenario and ssp2 4 5 scenario the dry year and warm year hardly occurred in the stem elongation stage and the whole growth period because of the lack of preconditions the dry year frequency was also very low in addition in each sugarcane growth period the frequency of drought dry and warm years under the high emission forcing scenario ssp5 8 5 was the highest followed by the medium emission forcing scenario ssp2 4 5 and the lowest under the low emission forcing scenario ssp1 2 6 it can be seen from fig 6 that the high frequency of drought in most growth periods is mainly concentrated in 2060 2100 because of the significant increase in the frequency of warm years in the long term period 2060 2100 in some growth periods even if precipitation does not change sugarcane drought events become frequent with an increase in warm years taking the sugarcane seeding stage as an example the frequency of precipitation deficits was generally low however with an increase in the emission forcing scenario the occurrence rate of warm years gradually increased ssp1 2 6 scenario 20 ssp2 4 5 scenario 48 ssp5 8 5 scenario 69 increasing the number of dry years ssp1 2 6 scenario 20 ssp2 4 5 scenario 21 ssp5 8 5 scenario 29 this also shows that global warming has become essential to sugarcane droughts the probability of the simultaneous occurrence of extremely warm and extremely dry conditions increased significantly between 2060 and 2100 fig 6 particularly in the ssp5 8 5 scenario under the scenarios of ssp2 4 5 and ssp5 8 5 at the tillering stage and ssp5 8 5 at the maturity stage the dry warm years increased significantly which means that the drought risk frequency of this year reached 100 at the same time it also shows that under the warming mode during the sugarcane growth period when these precipitation deficiencies occur in warm years they are more likely to produce drought 3 3 3 spatial variation of abnormally high temperature precipitation deficits and drought frequency in the historical period to further understand the spatial change trend of spei precipitation deficits and temperature anomaly occurrence frequency in different growth periods of sugarcane we calculated and spatialized the occurrence frequency of abnormal events using software such as envi5 0 and arcgis4 2 fig 7 the results showed that in general the frequency of drought and precipitation deficits was the highest in the mature stage of sugarcane followed by the tillering and seeding stages the stem elongation stage and the whole growth period were the lowest in different reproductive periods the frequency of warm years is not very different generally not more than 40 we found that during the mature period chongzuo city fangchenggang city beihai city qinzhou city and yulin city became high frequency areas of abnormally high temperature and precipitation deficits the rate of high temperature can reach 40 and the rate of precipitation deficits can reach 70 making these areas highly prone to drought the drought frequency is 44 fig 7a4 c4 during the tillering period the abnormally high temperature and precipitation deficits in qinzhou city and yulin city were synchronous the high temperature rate could reach 40 and the precipitation deficit rate could reach 40 thus affecting the occurrence of drought the drought frequency was 36 fig 7a2 c2 in the sugarcane seeding stage the frequency of high temperature and precipitation deficits coexisted in some areas of baise city and guigang city and the highest frequency of drought reached 36 in contrast the frequency of climate anomalies in the stem elongation stage and the entire growth period is generally low and it is worth noting that the western part of baise has a significant frequency of precipitation deficits and drought this also shows that drought can occur quickly once the temperature rises in this area 3 3 4 spatial variation of abnormally high temperature precipitation deficits and drought frequency in the future period the spatial frequency distributions of drought dry and warm years under the ssp1 2 6 ssp2 4 5 and ssp5 8 5 scenarios are shown in the figs 8 10 the results show that in all emission forcing scenarios the drought dry and warm years of sugarcane seeding tillering and maturity stages generally have a high frequency and the widest distribution range in addition compared with the baseline 1961 2019 with the strengthening of the emission forcing scenario the frequency of dry dry and warm years in the sugarcane growth period increased and the distribution range gradually expanded which also increased the possibility of overlapping the high frequency areas of precipitation deficits and warm years thus leading to more frequent dry and drought risks figs 8 10 shows that the drought occurrence probability is high in the dry or warm year high frequency sugarcane area in different growth periods however in areas where the warm dry year high frequency is synchronized the annual drought frequency can reach 100 under the scenario of ssp1 2 6 in the sugarcane seeding stage fig 8a1 the frequency of precipitation deficits in the urban areas in the west and southwest of guangxi and the northern part of guilin was up to 90 resulting in a drought frequency of 28 in the northern parts of guilin hezhou guigang wuzhou and yulin the warm year frequency is generally low in areas other than the west of baise city and northeast of guilin city it can be seen from the tillering and maturity stages of sugarcane that the frequency of precipitation deficits is higher in the eastern part of guangxi hechi city and nanning city the frequency of warm years is higher in the marginal urban areas resulting in a high frequency of drought mainly distributed in nanning city and the marginal areas of which the highest frequency of drought in some areas can reach 44 fig 8a4 in contrast the drought frequency of the stem elongation stage and the whole growth period was generally low in the main sugarcane producing areas of guangxi compared with the ssp1 2 6 scenario under the ssp2 4 5 scenario the frequency of precipitation deficits in the sugarcane seeding tillering and maturity stages increased by up to 90 and the distribution range significantly expanded mainly in central guangxi and the middle east it is worth noting that the frequency of warm years in the seeding and tillering stages also increased significantly and the distribution mainly expanded from southeast to northwest of guangxi this increases the frequency of warm dry years primarily distributed in chongzuo city qinzhou city beihai city yulin city guigang city wuzhou city hezhou city guilin city laibin city and liuzhou city with the highest frequency reaching more than 90 fig 9 e2 f2 e4 f4 in particular the areas with high drought frequency in the sugarcane tillering period were highly consistent with those in warm dry years fig 9 e1 f1 in addition owing to the low frequency of precipitation deficits in the long term stem elongation stage and the entire growth period the drought frequency was also the lowest however compared with the ssp1 2 6 scenario the long term stem elongation stage and the whole growth period are affected by warming in the ssp2 4 5 scenario and warm dry year synchronization occurs in southern guangxi resulting in an increase in the drought frequency in southern guangxi by approximately 12 compared with the ssp1 2 6 and ssp2 4 5 scenarios under the ssp5 8 5 scenario the frequency of warm years is significantly increased in all growth periods and the distribution range extends from the southeast to northwest of guangxi although the frequency distribution range of precipitation deficits changed little the frequency of droughts increased significantly under warming fig 10 under the ssp5 8 5 scenario the frequency of drought in the tillering and maturity stages of sugarcane was the highest followed by the seeding stage and the stem elongation stage and the entire growth period were the lowest however compared with the ssp2 4 5 scenario because of the expansion of the frequency range of warm years in the stem elongation stage and the entire growth period the drought frequency in northern central and southern guangxi increased by 8 4 and 10 respectively during the seeding stage drought frequency in central and southern guangxi reached 32 in the tillering and maturity stages drought frequency in some central guangxi areas reached 44 in addition in each growth period of sugarcane with the increase in high frequency synchronous areas in warm dry years the distribution range of high frequency of drought under the ssp5 8 5 scenario is the widest 4 discussions drought is one of the leading natural disasters threatening agricultural production and the direct cause of drought is low precipitation rising temperatures or a combination of these two factors zhang et al 2016 based on historical meteorological observation data and global climate model gcm data we analyzed the impact of long term warming and precipitation deficit on drought in different sugarcane growth periods our research results show that sugarcane drought does not show a cooling trend which means that the characteristics of sugarcane drought events are more warming that is drought in all growth periods is also extremely warm in terms of time series the probability of insufficient precipitation co occurring with warm conditions and the probability of drought caused by insufficient precipitation increased this is similar to the results of diffenbaugh et al 2015 and sun et al 2021 our study also confirmed the importance of temperature changes in drought in sugarcane growing areas although it is important to understand the possible changes in precipitation our results highlight that the analysis of drought in the sugarcane growth period without considering the effect of temperature may miss the key factors of drought risk in the sugarcane growth period in addition our results highlight that the drought occurrence rate in the maturity stage of sugarcane is the highest followed by the tillering and seeding stages and the drought occurrence frequency in the stem elongation stage and the entire growth stage is low which is consistent with previous results chen et al 2019 huang et al 2022 the reduction of precipitation in winter and spring and the substantial increase in temperature lead to accelerated water loss from the surface soil and canopy resulting in a serious shortage of soil water in winter and spring dry seasons song et al 2019 in addition over the years the autumn drought in guangxi has been relatively serious and the precipitation has apparent seasonality caused by the northward polar vortex activity in autumn the stronger the continental subtropical high the weaker the surface cold air activity in east asia and the periodic changes of enso events and solar activities li and li 2008 this also explains why drought precipitation deficits and high frequency of temperature anomalies are high during the sugarcane maturity period yuan et al 2019 found that under the background of global climate change the frequency and intensity of flash droughts in southern china will significantly increase further proving that the short term drought frequency of sugarcane will increase low temperatures and large daily ranges during sugarcane ripening are conducive to sugar accumulation therefore the significant warming trend in the maturity period intensified the vulnerability of sugarcane to drought in the maturity period consequently sugarcane farmers should pay more attention to the risks of short term drought during sugarcane growth with the strengthening of the forcing scenario owing to the increase in areas with a high frequency of occurrence in warm years the drought affected areas of sugarcane are also gradually expanding similarly the drought incidence rate of sugarcane in a short growth period was generally high and the distribution was the widest in general owing to climate warming the area affected by sugarcane drought has expanded and its frequency has increased similar to the results of han et al 2021 and liang et al 2020 in addition taking into account the regional differences in the climatic characteristics of crops and the proportion of planting areas zhang et al 2020 according to the climatic conditions of sugarcane production we selected five climatic factors table 4 including annual average temperature above 20 c accumulated temperature the average value of annual extreme minimum temperature daily average days consistently above 25 c and precipitation during 20 c through arcgis10 4 1stopt software and maxent model the refined climate division of sugarcane in guangxi is realized on this basis the spatial changes of the high frequency of high temperature precipitation deficit and drought in different growing periods and different planting areas of sugarcane were further discussed fig 11 we found that in the historical period the high incidence of precipitation deficit high temperature and drought during the growth stage of sugarcane was concentrated in the climate unsuitable planting areas in the west of guangxi mainly including baise city in the future the high incidence rate of drought caused by precipitation deficit in different growth periods of sugarcane will be concentrated primarily in the south of guangxi including chongzuo city fangchenggang city and beihai city which indicates that the current high suitability area for sugarcane may reach the extreme limit of sugarcane drought tolerance with the strengthening of the forced situation in addition the high incidence rate of high temperatures in the sugarcane growth stage is mainly concentrated in the higher latitude regions of guangxi it is not difficult to see that the high latitude regions are significantly warmer than the low latitude regions which also shows that the potential risk of drought in the high dimensional regions is greater in general because of climate warming and spatial and temporal distribution changes in precipitation deficit drought affected areas in different growth periods of sugarcane are also changing moreover the dryland agricultural system which depends on precipitation is strongly affected by rainfall during the crop growth stage which determines whether agricultural drought will occur zhang et al 2016 for sugarcane in guangxi because more than 80 of sugarcane fields are distributed on dry land that cannot be irrigated the warming trend has led to more sugarcane fields being exposed to drought disasters caused by precipitation deficit in addition because of the widespread karst landforms in guangxi they are seriously affected by drought li et al 2019 wang et al 2021 karst landforms are widely distributed in the main sugarcane production areas in karst landform areas water quickly infiltrates and the surface water storage performance is weak which is insufficient to meet the surface evapotranspiration demand liu et al 2011 however in guangxi the frequency of warm years gradually increases which affects evapotranspiration this phenomenon means that in the case of precipitation deficits in sugarcane fields distributed in karst landforms and dry lands the rising trend of temperature will cause rapid evaporation of soil water resulting in a decrease in water content thus further deepening the damage caused by drought during the sugarcane growth period we also note that the increased risk in a warm dry year will increase the occurrence of a sugarcane drought year by 100 research has shown that recorded temperatures may cause the most serious drought lu et al 2011 however many records also show that guangxi experienced a continuous and serious drought which began in 2009 and was the most serious from february to april 2010 although many uncertain factors are causing extreme drought the occurrence of an extremely warm year fig 5a4 significantly increases the risk of sugarcane drought in this region consequently sugarcane and sucrose production in guangxi continued to decline and the downward trend reached its lowest point in 2010 and 2011 li and yang 2015 according to data from the china sugar association http www chinasugar org cn china imported 1 766 million tons of sugar in 2010 at an average import price of 512 9 us dollars per ton both quantity and price have reached record high levels since 2000 long term warming intensifies drought during different sugarcane growth periods in guangxi it is estimated that the adverse effects of drought and the losses and damage related to sugarcane production will escalate with each increase in global warming sugarcane farmers should strengthen adaptation and mitigation actions to reduce drought risk and promote the sustainable development of the sugarcane industry in addition some limitations should be considered for example our method is implicit which analyzes the temperature and precipitation conditions of sugarcane in different growth periods and historically in years with lower spei but does not explicitly explore the physiological process of sugarcane drought the impact of temperature rise on sugarcane biomass dry matter dm biomass fresh matter fm sugar yield s and leaf area index lai remains a key uncertainty in the historical period and response to global warming similarly our analysis of anthropogenic forcing relies on global climate models which do not address the topographical complexity that strongly affects precipitation and temperature in the leading sugarcane producing areas of guangxi further research using high resolution modeling methods that better address boundary conditions and fine scale processes diffenbaugh et al 2005 lebassi habtezion et al 2013 and or using an analysis focused on the potential large scale climate dynamics of a single extreme event swain et al 2014 duchˆene et al 2022 thrasher et al 2022 may help overcome the limitations of simulating precipitation and temperature in current global climate models 5 conclusion in this study sugarcane in guangxi china was taken as the research object the spei was selected as the drought identification index of sugarcane and the effects of precipitation deficits and temperature anomalies during different growth periods on drought were analyzed on this basis the impact of climate warming on the degree of drought in sugarcane was revealed and the following conclusions were obtained in terms of time the drought frequency in different growth periods of sugarcane observed in history was similar to that in future scenarios because of the significant frequency of precipitation deficit and warm years in seeding tillering and maturity periods the drought frequency in these three stages is high with the strengthening of the forced emissions scenario the probability of precipitation deficits co occurring with warm conditions and the probability of drought caused by warming increased in terms of spatial change because of climate warming the range of sugarcane growth stages affected by drought is gradually expanding with the highest incidence of drought at maturity tillering and seeding stage drought frequency in the stem elongation and the whole growth period increasing with a decrease in latitude in addition the simultaneous occurrence rate of precipitation deficit and warm years in sugarcane in baise city in the west of the study area was significant the frequency of warm years in the northern high latitude area was high and the potential risk of drought was high it is worth mentioning that global warming may change the lack of precipitation in the southern areas which are currently considered highly suitable for sugarcane planting mainly chongzuo city fangchenggang city and beihai city resulting in a high incidence of drought the guangxi government has made efforts to centralize sugarcane planting improve mechanization and increase planting subsidies to manage and mitigate the impact of drought risk however our research results show that global warming has increased the possibility of sugarcane drought in guangxi and

9204,sugarcane planting is the largest cash crop industry in guangxi and plays an essential role in national sugar security however as the climate warms in recent years agricultural drought has occurred frequently and repeatedly in guangxi including drought in 2009 2010 extreme warm and dry created a shortage of water resources resulting in a severe reduction in sugarcane production in guangxi and a large gap in the sugar market our study used the standardized precipitation evapotranspiration index spei to identify and monitor sugarcane drought disasters in guangxi analyze the impact of long term warming on drought in different sugarcane growth periods caused by precipitation deficits and explore the change in sugarcane drought exposure under climate change 1 based on historical climate observations warmth and precipitation deficits co occurred and the possibility of drought in the sugarcane growth stage was 100 we found that although the probability of precipitation deficit did not change substantially in sugarcane the occurrence of seeding and maturity stage drought years was greater in the past 30 years than in the preceding 28 in addition the different growth periods of sugarcane also exhibited more warming characteristics 2 the multi model ensemble reveal that climate warming has increased the probability of drought years are also warmer in all sugarcane growing seasons with the highest incidence of drought occurring during the seeding tillering and maturity stage as the forced emission scenario is strengthened the probability of precipitation deficits and warm conditions occurring simultaneously will increase as will the probability of warming induced drought 3 under the warming scenario the sugarcane drought affected areas are gradually expanding which could result in the current highly suitable sugarcane planting areas reach the drought tolerance limit from stem elongation to whole growth period drought occurrence increases as latitude decreases in addition the risk of short term drought risk of sugarcane becomes more challenging especially the drought in the mature period which may become the main limiting factor in achieving a high yield of sugarcane in this region keywords drought climate extremes sugarcane event attribution cmip6 data availability no data was used for the research described in the

1980 the temperatures of major agricultural countries have gradually increased and drought events have further strengthened the negative impacts on plant growth physiology and fertility lobell et al 2011 zhu et al 2021 sugarcane is a perennial tropical and subtropical grass that is the raw material for making sucrose and can be refined into ethanol as an energy substitute austin et al 1978 sindhu et al 2016 tayt sohn et al 2018 the growing environment of sugarcane requires sufficient solar radiation and rainfall so it is well adapted to the climatic conditions from 30 north latitude to 30 south latitude in the world lovett and lazenby 1979 china s sugar industry is mainly distributed in south with a scale of approximately 1 5 million hectares li and yang 2015 huang et al 2006 the sugarcane industry in guangxi is the most influential and advantageous in china its planting area accounts for more than 60 of the country and its sugar output accounts for 70 it has contributed approximately 7 billion us dollars to the gdp ranking first in the country li and yang 2015 wang et al 2019 zhu et al 2007 the growth rate yield and sugar content of sugarcane are closely related to temperature and precipitation in guangxi the annual average temperature during the whole growth period is required to be approximately 24 and the annual rainfall 1200 mm however different growth stages have different requirements for temperature conditions the minimum temperature at the seeding stage is 13 and the optimum temperature is 30 32 the daily average temperature at tillering stage shall be 20 and the optimum temperature for the stem elongation stage is 25 30 the elongation was inhibited when the temperature is higher than 34 the elongation was slow when the temperature was lower than 20 the elongation stops when the temperature is lower than 10 low temperatures and large daily range during the maturity stage are conducive to sugar accumulation su et al 2006 in addition rainfall dependent dryland agricultural systems are strongly affected by rainfall during the crop growth stage which determines whether agricultural drought will occur zhang et al 2016 compared with the production in other sugar producing areas in the world more than 80 of the sugarcane fields are distributed on slopes that depend on rainfall li and wei 2006 however under the background of global warming the originally humid areas in southern china may face a drying trend which is an important factor leading to the reduction in sugarcane production in guangxi during the severe drought period guangxi is currently suffering from the once in a century drought which has extremely high temperatures and extremely low precipitation occurred causing extreme drought anomaly monthly average spei anomaly 2 sd precipitation below the average level 2 sd and temperature above the average level 1 sd 0 5 c higher than the average temperature in the same period of 2000 2015 lu et al 2011 li et al 2019 the direct cause of the precipitation deficit is an anomaly of the general circulation system and global warming may increase the possibility of this situation although the reasons and historical background of the decrease in precipitation have been discussed in depth the impact of historical temperature changes on individual drought probabilities in different growth periods of crops has not been widely studied lu et al 2011 wang et al 2015 verma et al 2019 yang et al 2020 although precipitation deficits are a prerequisite for water shortage constituting drought dai 2011 higher temperatures amplify the evaporation demand thus increasing the overall drought intensity and impact dai 2013 diffenbaugh et al 2015 quantified the probability of precipitation deficits and temperature anomalies for drought years in california based on historical climate and climate model data zhang et al 2020 analyzed the impact of climate factors in critical periods on the comprehensive loss of dry crops in south china qiang et al 2018 summarized the trends of drought occurrence and agricultural yield decline and clarified that agriculture in southern china is more sensitive to temperature change yang et al 2020 used long term meteorological data and a neural network model to analyze the impact of precipitation and temperature models on agricultural drought in china in addition research on sugarcane mainly includes the impact of extreme climate events such as drought on sugarcane production santillán fernández et al 2016 liang et al 2020 linnenluecke et al 2020 climatic suitability analysis of sugarcane expansion tayt sohn et al 2018 ruan et al 2018 sugarcane can be used as bio energy to mitigate climate change loarie et al 2011 spera et al 2017 however there are few studies on the impact of the interaction between temperature rise and rainfall on drought during different growth periods of sugarcane under climate change research shows that the aggregate combination of extremely high temperatures and very low precipitation during the 2010 2011 event is the most severe in over a century which has severely impacted sugarcane production such as large sugar crop failure and economic losses li et al 2019 guga et al 2021 because the severity of drought and warmth coincide we have considered whether long term warming has altered the probability that precipitation deficits yield extreme drought in sugarcane growing season therefore based on historical meteorological observation data and global climate model gcm data this study used the standardized precipitation evapotranspiration index spei to quantify sugarcane drought disasters in guangxi fully considering that extremely warm and dry conditions are important factors of sugarcane drought and analyzed the possibility of long term warming and precipitation deficits to drought in different growth periods of sugarcane in guangxi on this basis the drought exposure of sugarcane in guangxi in the context climate change is further discussed its primary purpose is to 1 identify and quantify the indicators of sugarcane drought in guangxi and to realize dynamic monitoring and prediction of disasters 2 analyze temporal and spatial characteristics of the precipitation deficit and abnormal temperature during the sugarcane growth stage 3 identify the contribution of abnormal temperature and precipitation changes to drought occurrence probability and 4 discuss changes in sugarcane drought exposure under the global warming this study can improve the understanding of the impact of climate warming on drought caused by precipitation deficit in different growth periods of sugarcane in guangxi and provide a reference for formulating regional adaptation and disaster reduction strategies 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area guangxi is located from 104 26 112 04 e to 20 54 26 24 fig 1 and belongs to a typical subtropical monsoon climate zone guangxi crops include grain and cash crops among which cash crops are famous for planting sugarcane the entire sugarcane growth period requires abundant hydrothermal conditions generally the annual average temperature is 18 30 and the annual rainfall is 1200 mm the guangxi s terrain is complex and variable it is primarily composed of mountains hills and plains the highest altitude is 2800 m agricultural resources are widely developed in lowland and plain areas wang et al 2019 sugarcane is mainly planted in hilly basins and semi mountainous slopes with relatively shallow farming layers which belongs to typical rain fed dry farming tong et al 2018 huang et al 2020 in addition there is a wide range of karst landforms in guangxi the water in karst landforms infiltrates quickly and the surface water storage capacity is weak which can easily cause surface drought karst landforms in the main sugarcane producing areas are widely distributed so it is easier to form droughts than in the surrounding areas wang et al 2010 2 2 data 2 2 1 climate data in our study historical daily observation data of meteorological stations were obtained from the national meteorological information center http data cma cn including daily rainfall maximum and minimum temperature wind speed relative humidity and sunshine hours from 1960 to 2019 it is generated through sorting computing and spatial interpolation the monthly grid data from the national earth system science data center national science technology infrastructure of china http www geodata cn peng et al 2019 mainly included the monthly average temperature and monthly precipitation from 1960 to 2019 with a spatial resolution of 0 5 0 5 it is convenient to calculate the sugarcane drought index and unify the spatial resolution of daily data and monthly data to 0 05 0 05 to analyze the possible impact of climate change on sugarcane growth in the future we obtained simulation data of monthly temperature and precipitation 1960 2100 from 24 global climate models in phase 6 of the coupled model mutual comparison project cmip6 table 1 relevant studies have proven that these global climate models have good simulation ability in china through the calculation and analysis of relative error and root mean square error song et al 2021 zhao et al 2021 song and yan 2022 cmip6 integrates the scientific combination scenarios of shared socioeconomic paths ssps and representative concentrated paths rcps into the impact of socioeconomic development including seven combination scenarios ssp1 1 9 ssp1 2 6 ssp4 3 4 ssp2 4 5 ssp4 6 0 ssp3 7 0 and ssp5 8 5 we selected the ssp1 2 6 ssp2 4 5 and ssp5 8 5 climate scenarios representing low emission forcing medium emission forcing and high emission forcing scenarios respectively veronika et al 2016 msa and yi 2021 arunrat et al 2022 because the spatial resolution of the 24 global climate models was different we used all grid points overlapping with the geographical boundary of guangxi to calculate the temperature and precipitation values at the local resolution of each model finally we used the bilinear interpolation method to unify the spatial resolution of the data to 0 05 0 05 which is convenient for calculating the average of the model set and calculating abnormal climate events 2 2 2 crop data to analyze and quantify the impact of climate anomalies on sugarcane yield under climate warming data on sugarcane yield and sowing area at the city county level were obtained from the data sets of the guangxi statistics bureau http tjj gxzf gov cn and statistical yearbooks of various cities the obtained data were processed into the same units mt ha between 1960 and 2019 owing to the different lengths of sugarcane production records in each county we decided to exclude counties with missing data over five consecutive years 2 3 methods 2 3 1 calculation of drought index vicente serrano et al 2010 proposed a spei as a meteorological drought index the spei is superior to other drought indices in estimating the impact of drought on crop production vicente serrano et al 2010 2012 wang et al 2016 peña gallardo et al 2019 therefore the spei has been widely used to analyze the impact of meteorological drought on agricultural production at regional and global scales shi and tao 2014 to analyze the drought change characteristics of sugarcane in different growth periods under the background of global warming we used the spei as the sugarcane drought monitoring index presently the most commonly used methods to calculate et0 are the penman monteith and thornthwatie methods the penman monteith method is based on a physical process that uses humidity air pressure wind speed and radiation for calculation and is relatively accurate compared with the penman monteith method the data required by the thornthwatie method are easy to obtain and have been widely used in calculating et0 in china therefore we calculated the spei index based on the thornthwaite and penman monteith methods to screen the calculation methods suitable for this study 1 et 0 model a thornthwaite et 0 model 1 et 0 16 k 10 t i h a where t i is the monthly average temperature h is the annual

precipitation and abnormal temperature climate anomaly refers to a situation in which the climate deviates from the average climate state currently anomalies temperature and anomaly percentages precipitation are mainly used to quantitatively characterize the degree of climate deviation from the average state liu et al 2010 zhou et al 2017 using historical meteorological observations and cmip6 data we calculated the simulated temperature and precipitation time series for different sugarcane growth periods in guangxi from each observed or simulated time series we calculated ① the average value and percentage deviation of different growth periods of sugarcane in the record length ② the annual abnormal value of the average value of different growth periods of sugarcane and ③ the standard deviation s of the time series of different growth periods of sugarcane according to the world meteorological organization wmo classification criteria for climate anomalies climate anomalies refer to the presence of only one rare meteorological phenomenon over more than 25 years if the overall distribution is a positive probability distribution that is when the absolute deviation exceeds twice the standard deviation the element is considered abnormal we comprehensively considered the calculation method of diffenbaugh et al 2015 and liu et al 2010 for abnormal values and considered that the absolute value of the temperature anomaly in different growth periods of sugarcane exceeded the standard deviation as the standard for the occurrence of warm years if the percentage of precipitation anomaly was less than 20 it was considered the year of precipitation deficit 2 3 3 calculation of frequency of drought abnormal precipitation and abnormal temperature drought frequency yang et al 2022 abnormal rainfall and temperature anomaly frequency refer to the ratio of abnormal climate events at a particular growth stage to the total number of years in a statistical period and can generally represent the frequency of disasters in this study according to the grade standards of drought insufficient rainfall and abnormal temperature if one of the above standards for drought abnormal rainfall and abnormal temperature is met in the grids of different growth periods of sugarcane it will be recorded as 1 otherwise it will be recorded as 0 the total number of occurrences in each grid was the sum of the annual occurrences in the different growth periods during the study period 2 3 4 calculation of climatic yield and yield fluctuation generally the agricultural output process is mainly affected by climatic social science and technological factors only by obtaining meteorological output can we study the impact of climate change on crop output more accurately currently the commonly used methods for extracting crop trend yields include the moving average method linear regression method and hp filtering method potopová et al 2015 peña gallardo et al 2019 li et al 2020 in this study taking the 58 year long time series yield data of sugarcane in guangxi province as an example the sliding average method linear regression method and hp filtering method are used to extract the trend yield by analyzing and evaluating the rationality of the trend yield and meteorological yield separated by the three methods that is considering the fluctuation rate of the trend yield fig 2 and the correlation with the actual yield table 3 the hp filtering method was determined to be the most appropriate method for extracting the trend yield of sugarcane therefore to eliminate the output growth trend caused by non climate factors such as farmland management technology we use the hp filtering method to de trend sugarcane output data and generate meteorological output in metric t ha 10 y c y y t where y is the sugarcane yield per unit area y t is the trend yield y c is the meteorological yield which is the fluctuating output component affected by climatic factors and reflects the favorable or unfavorable climatic conditions and their impact on the output year by year the yield fluctuation can be calculated as follows 11 y r y y t y t where y r denotes the output fluctuation rate the year in which the yield fluctuation rate is negative is the production reduction year and the size is the production reduction rate the general yield fluctuation rate can be expressed as a percentage of the actual yield deviating from the trend yield 2 3 5 taylor diagram and multi model ensemble generally the correlation coefficient r root mean square error rmse and standard deviation sd of the simulated and observed datasets are used to evaluate the simulation ability of cmip models zhu et al 2019 qin et al 2021 the taylor chart can provide a more comprehensive evaluation of the simulation ability of various gcms models huang et al 2022 which can display the r rmse and sd of the simulation and observation datasets in the polar graph when the distance between the model point and observation point was shorter the distance to the origin was closer to 1 and the correlation coefficient was larger in short the closer it is to the observation point the stronger the simulation energy of the model karl and taylor 2001 in addition relevant studies have proven that the simulation ability of a multi model ensemble mme is better than that of a single mode zhu et al 2020 therefore we performed ensemble averaging on the 24 gcms using the equal weight method 3 results 3 1 simulation verification of drought index because precipitation and reference crop evapotranspiration are considered in the calculation of spei it is outstanding in research on agricultural drought vicente serrano et al 2010 however spei indices calculated using different formulas are different we calculated the spei index based on the thornthwaite and penman monteith methods through fitting and comparison we found that the pearson correlation coefficient was 0 93 and the degree of fitting was very high fig 3c in addition we note that the spatial distribution of spei calculated based on the thornthwaite method and penman monteith method in the sugarcane growth stage are also similar fig 3 a b therefore considering the multiple sources and availability of global climate model data we selected the spei index based on the thornthwaite method for the analysis of this study the identification and quantification of agrometeorological disasters must be analyzed with crop yield therefore to further test the drought index used in this study based on the theory of natural disaster formation we multiplied the frequency and intensity of drought in the study area to obtain the drought risk assessment model second correlation and regression analyses were conducted between the average yield reduction rate of the 25 representative stations and the sugarcane drought risk index obtained by the risk assessment model during the study period 1989 2019 fig 3d as shown in the figure there was a significant positive correlation between the drought risk value and sugarcane yield reduction rate the r square is 0 641 a significance test of 0 01 showed that the higher the drought risk value the greater the sugarcane yield reduction rate therefore the spei adopted in this study can better reflect the drought situation of sugarcane in guangxi in addition through historical meteorological observation data we found that the abnormal years of monthly precipitation and temperature used to calculate the drought index were consistent with typical years of sugarcane yield reduction fig 2 fig 5 1977 2000 2009 2011 and 2014 were the years of serious yield reduction especially 2009 2010 was the year when guangxi suffered a drought once in a century which caused severe damage to sugarcane production in the growth stage of sugarcane insufficient precipitation and abnormally high temperatures occurred during the year of severe yield reduction the results showed that the drought index temperature and precipitation were closely related to fluctuations in sugarcane yield 3 2 climate model capability assessment we objectively evaluated the simulation ability of the 24 cmip6 climate models and mme on the average temperature and precipitation in the leading sugarcane producing areas in guangxi using a taylor chart and then calculated the correlation coefficient standard error and rmse between the simulated and observed values of the monthly average temperature and monthly cumulative precipitation in the leading sugarcane producing areas from 1960 to 2015 and reflected all the information in the taylor chart fig 4 the color shapes in the figure correspond to the 24 climate patterns and one mme and the red dots on the horizontal axis represent the observed values the simulation ability of the model is stronger when the model point is closer to the observation point in fig 4 a the temperature correlation coefficient between each model and the observed value is between 0 85 and 0 96 which has good simulation ability however mme has an outstanding ability to simulate the air temperature with a correlation coefficient of 0 97 p 0 01 and its sd and rmse are also closest to the observed values indicating that mme can better simulate the air temperature in the study area from fig 4 b it is easy to see that compared with the temperature the simulation ability of precipitation is lower but the same mme has the best simulation ability of precipitation with a correlation coefficient of 0 84 p 0 01 the mme has the best simulation ability for temperature and precipitation with correlation coefficients greater than 0 8 the sd and rmse are also close to the observed values indicating that the mme can better simulate temperature and precipitation in the study area therefore we realized the affirmation and selection of mme through the optimal results of taylor diagram simulation 3 3 temporal and spatial variation of abnormal climate events in sugarcane production under climate change 3 3 1 temporal variation of abnormal temperature precipitation deficits and drought in the historical period because sugarcane has a fixed growth cycle which can be divided into the seeding stage march to april tillering stage may stem elongation stage june to october maturity stage november and entire growth period march to november we focused on spei temperature and average precipitation in guangxi during the critical growth period of sugarcane fig 5 we found that in the seeding stage the probability of drought occurrence in 1990 2019 was approximately twice that in 1961 1989 three droughts occurred in 1962 1989 accounted for 10 six droughts occurred in 1990 2019 accounted for 20 the increased drought years also impacted the probability of precipitation anomalies 20 in 1961 1889 and 26 in 1990 2019 fig 5a1 compared with 1961 1989 the frequency of precipitation deficits in dry years decreased over the past 30 years fig 5b1 in contrast in the tillering stage the probability of drought in 1990 2019 was approximately half of that in 1961 1989 seven droughts in 1962 1989 accounted for 24 three droughts in 1990 2019 accounted for 10 however the probability of precipitation deficits in the years with precipitation deficits and the years with precipitation deficits in the dry years showed an increasing trend fig 5a2 b2 indicating the probability of drought in the tillering period of sugarcane was still high from fig 5 a3 b3 it is clear that the long term drought frequency of stem extension is low and the drought occurrence year is synchronous with the year of precipitation deficits it is worth noting that in all growth stages the drought frequency of the sugarcane maturity stage was the highest and the drought trend was significantly increased eight droughts occurred in 1962 1989 accounted for 28 11 droughts occurred in 1990 2019 accounted for 37 of the whole year fig 5a4 in addition the coincidence between the abnormal precipitation and drought years was also the highest fig 5b4 however drought frequency was the lowest during the entire sugarcane growth period from 1961 2019 only two droughts occurred similarly the number of abnormal precipitation years was extremely low the observation records show that the year of drought is highly consistent with the year of precipitation deficit indicating that less precipitation is the premise of drought when these precipitation deficiencies occur during warm years they are more likely to produce drought it is not difficult to find that in different growth periods of sugarcane most drought years occur in years with high temperatures fig 5c1 c5 however in the case of precipitation deficits and high temperatures the occurrence rate in dry years can reach 100 fig 5a1 a5 the occurrence rate of warm dry years increased significantly during the maturity period of sugarcane which led to a significant increase in dry years 13 in 1962 1989 27 in 1990 2019 fig 5a4 at the same time we have also captured the phenomenon that occurs in dry years in warm dry years compared with cold dry years and the trend of increasing year by year the increase in drought risk during the sugarcane growth period occurred when the occurrence of low precipitation years lacked substantial change in contrast the increase in warm conditions led to a general increase in the temperature of sugarcane during different growth periods fig 5a c which also showed that the main sugarcane production areas in guangxi were affected by climate warming compared to 1961 1989 in the past 30 years the occurrence of abnormally high temperatures has significantly increased in all growth stages of sugarcane seeding stage 14 17 tillering stage 14 20 stem elongation stage 3 23 maturity stage 10 26 whole growth period 3 30 in contrast the frequency of abnormally low temperatures significantly decreased fig 5a1 a4 therefore the observed warming of the sugarcane growth period to a certain extent increases the possibility that precipitation deficits occur in warm years 3 3 2 temporal variation of abnormally high temperature precipitation deficits and drought in the future period we used the mme of cmip6 to estimate ssp1 2 6 at different growth stages of sugarcane in guangxi ssp2 4 5 occurrence of drought dry and warm years under the ssp5 8 5 scenario fig 6 the results showed that in different sugarcane growth periods the simulated annual frequency of drought was similar to the historical observation records the high frequency of drought was mainly concentrated in the seeding tillering and maturity stages whereas the frequency of drought in the stem elongation stage and the whole growth period was lower especially in the ssp1 2 6 scenario and ssp2 4 5 scenario the dry year and warm year hardly occurred in the stem elongation stage and the whole growth period because of the lack of preconditions the dry year frequency was also very low in addition in each sugarcane growth period the frequency of drought dry and warm years under the high emission forcing scenario ssp5 8 5 was the highest followed by the medium emission forcing scenario ssp2 4 5 and the lowest under the low emission forcing scenario ssp1 2 6 it can be seen from fig 6 that the high frequency of drought in most growth periods is mainly concentrated in 2060 2100 because of the significant increase in the frequency of warm years in the long term period 2060 2100 in some growth periods even if precipitation does not change sugarcane drought events become frequent with an increase in warm years taking the sugarcane seeding stage as an example the frequency of precipitation deficits was generally low however with an increase in the emission forcing scenario the occurrence rate of warm years gradually increased ssp1 2 6 scenario 20 ssp2 4 5 scenario 48 ssp5 8 5 scenario 69 increasing the number of dry years ssp1 2 6 scenario 20 ssp2 4 5 scenario 21 ssp5 8 5 scenario 29 this also shows that global warming has become essential to sugarcane droughts the probability of the simultaneous occurrence of extremely warm and extremely dry conditions increased significantly between 2060 and 2100 fig 6 particularly in the ssp5 8 5 scenario under the scenarios of ssp2 4 5 and ssp5 8 5 at the tillering stage and ssp5 8 5 at the maturity stage the dry warm years increased significantly which means that the drought risk frequency of this year reached 100 at the same time it also shows that under the warming mode during the sugarcane growth period when these precipitation deficiencies occur in warm years they are more likely to produce drought 3 3 3 spatial variation of abnormally high temperature precipitation deficits and drought frequency in the historical period to further understand the spatial change trend of spei precipitation deficits and temperature anomaly occurrence frequency in different growth periods of sugarcane we calculated and spatialized the occurrence frequency of abnormal events using software such as envi5 0 and arcgis4 2 fig 7 the results showed that in general the frequency of drought and precipitation deficits was the highest in the mature stage of sugarcane followed by the tillering and seeding stages the stem elongation stage and the whole growth period were the lowest in different reproductive periods the frequency of warm years is not very different generally not more than 40 we found that during the mature period chongzuo city fangchenggang city beihai city qinzhou city and yulin city became high frequency areas of abnormally high temperature and precipitation deficits the rate of high temperature can reach 40 and the rate of precipitation deficits can reach 70 making these areas highly prone to drought the drought frequency is 44 fig 7a4 c4 during the tillering period the abnormally high temperature and precipitation deficits in qinzhou city and yulin city were synchronous the high temperature rate could reach 40 and the precipitation deficit rate could reach 40 thus affecting the occurrence of drought the drought frequency was 36 fig 7a2 c2 in the sugarcane seeding stage the frequency of high temperature and precipitation deficits coexisted in some areas of baise city and guigang city and the highest frequency of drought reached 36 in contrast the frequency of climate anomalies in the stem elongation stage and the entire growth period is generally low and it is worth noting that the western part of baise has a significant frequency of precipitation deficits and drought this also shows that drought can occur quickly once the temperature rises in this area 3 3 4 spatial variation of abnormally high temperature precipitation deficits and drought frequency in the future period the spatial frequency distributions of drought dry and warm years under the ssp1 2 6 ssp2 4 5 and ssp5 8 5 scenarios are shown in the figs 8 10 the results show that in all emission forcing scenarios the drought dry and warm years of sugarcane seeding tillering and maturity stages generally have a high frequency and the widest distribution range in addition compared with the baseline 1961 2019 with the strengthening of the emission forcing scenario the frequency of dry dry and warm years in the sugarcane growth period increased and the distribution range gradually expanded which also increased the possibility of overlapping the high frequency areas of precipitation deficits and warm years thus leading to more frequent dry and drought risks figs 8 10 shows that the drought occurrence probability is high in the dry or warm year high frequency sugarcane area in different growth periods however in areas where the warm dry year high frequency is synchronized the annual drought frequency can reach 100 under the scenario of ssp1 2 6 in the sugarcane seeding stage fig 8a1 the frequency of precipitation deficits in the urban areas in the west and southwest of guangxi and the northern part of guilin was up to 90 resulting in a drought frequency of 28 in the northern parts of guilin hezhou guigang wuzhou and yulin the warm year frequency is generally low in areas other than the west of baise city and northeast of guilin city it can be seen from the tillering and maturity stages of sugarcane that the frequency of precipitation deficits is higher in the eastern part of guangxi hechi city and nanning city the frequency of warm years is higher in the marginal urban areas resulting in a high frequency of drought mainly distributed in nanning city and the marginal areas of which the highest frequency of drought in some areas can reach 44 fig 8a4 in contrast the drought frequency of the stem elongation stage and the whole growth period was generally low in the main sugarcane producing areas of guangxi compared with the ssp1 2 6 scenario under the ssp2 4 5 scenario the frequency of precipitation deficits in the sugarcane seeding tillering and maturity stages increased by up to 90 and the distribution range significantly expanded mainly in central guangxi and the middle east it is worth noting that the frequency of warm years in the seeding and tillering stages also increased significantly and the distribution mainly expanded from southeast to northwest of guangxi this increases the frequency of warm dry years primarily distributed in chongzuo city qinzhou city beihai city yulin city guigang city wuzhou city hezhou city guilin city laibin city and liuzhou city with the highest frequency reaching more than 90 fig 9 e2 f2 e4 f4 in particular the areas with high drought frequency in the sugarcane tillering period were highly consistent with those in warm dry years fig 9 e1 f1 in addition owing to the low frequency of precipitation deficits in the long term stem elongation stage and the entire growth period the drought frequency was also the lowest however compared with the ssp1 2 6 scenario the long term stem elongation stage and the whole growth period are affected by warming in the ssp2 4 5 scenario and warm dry year synchronization occurs in southern guangxi resulting in an increase in the drought frequency in southern guangxi by approximately 12 compared with the ssp1 2 6 and ssp2 4 5 scenarios under the ssp5 8 5 scenario the frequency of warm years is significantly increased in all growth periods and the distribution range extends from the southeast to northwest of guangxi although the frequency distribution range of precipitation deficits changed little the frequency of droughts increased significantly under warming fig 10 under the ssp5 8 5 scenario the frequency of drought in the tillering and maturity stages of sugarcane was the highest followed by the seeding stage and the stem elongation stage and the entire growth period were the lowest however compared with the ssp2 4 5 scenario because of the expansion of the frequency range of warm years in the stem elongation stage and the entire growth period the drought frequency in northern central and southern guangxi increased by 8 4 and 10 respectively during the seeding stage drought frequency in central and southern guangxi reached 32 in the tillering and maturity stages drought frequency in some central guangxi areas reached 44 in addition in each growth period of sugarcane with the increase in high frequency synchronous areas in warm dry years the distribution range of high frequency of drought under the ssp5 8 5 scenario is the widest 4 discussions drought is one of the leading natural disasters threatening agricultural production and the direct cause of drought is low precipitation rising temperatures or a combination of these two factors zhang et al 2016 based on historical meteorological observation data and global climate model gcm data we analyzed the impact of long term warming and precipitation deficit on drought in different sugarcane growth periods our research results show that sugarcane drought does not show a cooling trend which means that the characteristics of sugarcane drought events are more warming that is drought in all growth periods is also extremely warm in terms of time series the probability of insufficient precipitation co occurring with warm conditions and the probability of drought caused by insufficient precipitation increased this is similar to the results of diffenbaugh et al 2015 and sun et al 2021 our study also confirmed the importance of temperature changes in drought in sugarcane growing areas although it is important to understand the possible changes in precipitation our results highlight that the analysis of drought in the sugarcane growth period without considering the effect of temperature may miss the key factors of drought risk in the sugarcane growth period in addition our results highlight that the drought occurrence rate in the maturity stage of sugarcane is the highest followed by the tillering and seeding stages and the drought occurrence frequency in the stem elongation stage and the entire growth stage is low which is consistent with previous results chen et al 2019 huang et al 2022 the reduction of precipitation in winter and spring and the substantial increase in temperature lead to accelerated water loss from the surface soil and canopy resulting in a serious shortage of soil water in winter and spring dry seasons song et al 2019 in addition over the years the autumn drought in guangxi has been relatively serious and the precipitation has apparent seasonality caused by the northward polar vortex activity in autumn the stronger the continental subtropical high the weaker the surface cold air activity in east asia and the periodic changes of enso events and solar activities li and li 2008 this also explains why drought precipitation deficits and high frequency of temperature anomalies are high during the sugarcane maturity period yuan et al 2019 found that under the background of global climate change the frequency and intensity of flash droughts in southern china will significantly increase further proving that the short term drought frequency of sugarcane will increase low temperatures and large daily ranges during sugarcane ripening are conducive to sugar accumulation therefore the significant warming trend in the maturity period intensified the vulnerability of sugarcane to drought in the maturity period consequently sugarcane farmers should pay more attention to the risks of short term drought during sugarcane growth with the strengthening of the forcing scenario owing to the increase in areas with a high frequency of occurrence in warm years the drought affected areas of sugarcane are also gradually expanding similarly the drought incidence rate of sugarcane in a short growth period was generally high and the distribution was the widest in general owing to climate warming the area affected by sugarcane drought has expanded and its frequency has increased similar to the results of han et al 2021 and liang et al 2020 in addition taking into account the regional differences in the climatic characteristics of crops and the proportion of planting areas zhang et al 2020 according to the climatic conditions of sugarcane production we selected five climatic factors table 4 including annual average temperature above 20 c accumulated temperature the average value of annual extreme minimum temperature daily average days consistently above 25 c and precipitation during 20 c through arcgis10 4 1stopt software and maxent model the refined climate division of sugarcane in guangxi is realized on this basis the spatial changes of the high frequency of high temperature precipitation deficit and drought in different growing periods and different planting areas of sugarcane were further discussed fig 11 we found that in the historical period the high incidence of precipitation deficit high temperature and drought during the growth stage of sugarcane was concentrated in the climate unsuitable planting areas in the west of guangxi mainly including baise city in the future the high incidence rate of drought caused by precipitation deficit in different growth periods of sugarcane will be concentrated primarily in the south of guangxi including chongzuo city fangchenggang city and beihai city which indicates that the current high suitability area for sugarcane may reach the extreme limit of sugarcane drought tolerance with the strengthening of the forced situation in addition the high incidence rate of high temperatures in the sugarcane growth stage is mainly concentrated in the higher latitude regions of guangxi it is not difficult to see that the high latitude regions are significantly warmer than the low latitude regions which also shows that the potential risk of drought in the high dimensional regions is greater in general because of climate warming and spatial and temporal distribution changes in precipitation deficit drought affected areas in different growth periods of sugarcane are also changing moreover the dryland agricultural system which depends on precipitation is strongly affected by rainfall during the crop growth stage which determines whether agricultural drought will occur zhang et al 2016 for sugarcane in guangxi because more than 80 of sugarcane fields are distributed on dry land that cannot be irrigated the warming trend has led to more sugarcane fields being exposed to drought disasters caused by precipitation deficit in addition because of the widespread karst landforms in guangxi they are seriously affected by drought li et al 2019 wang et al 2021 karst landforms are widely distributed in the main sugarcane production areas in karst landform areas water quickly infiltrates and the surface water storage performance is weak which is insufficient to meet the surface evapotranspiration demand liu et al 2011 however in guangxi the frequency of warm years gradually increases which affects evapotranspiration this phenomenon means that in the case of precipitation deficits in sugarcane fields distributed in karst landforms and dry lands the rising trend of temperature will cause rapid evaporation of soil water resulting in a decrease in water content thus further deepening the damage caused by drought during the sugarcane growth period we also note that the increased risk in a warm dry year will increase the occurrence of a sugarcane drought year by 100 research has shown that recorded temperatures may cause the most serious drought lu et al 2011 however many records also show that guangxi experienced a continuous and serious drought which began in 2009 and was the most serious from february to april 2010 although many uncertain factors are causing extreme drought the occurrence of an extremely warm year fig 5a4 significantly increases the risk of sugarcane drought in this region consequently sugarcane and sucrose production in guangxi continued to decline and the downward trend reached its lowest point in 2010 and 2011 li and yang 2015 according to data from the china sugar association http www chinasugar org cn china imported 1 766 million tons of sugar in 2010 at an average import price of 512 9 us dollars per ton both quantity and price have reached record high levels since 2000 long term warming intensifies drought during different sugarcane growth periods in guangxi it is estimated that the adverse effects of drought and the losses and damage related to sugarcane production will escalate with each increase in global warming sugarcane farmers should strengthen adaptation and mitigation actions to reduce drought risk and promote the sustainable development of the sugarcane industry in addition some limitations should be considered for example our method is implicit which analyzes the temperature and precipitation conditions of sugarcane in different growth periods and historically in years with lower spei but does not explicitly explore the physiological process of sugarcane drought the impact of temperature rise on sugarcane biomass dry matter dm biomass fresh matter fm sugar yield s and leaf area index lai remains a key uncertainty in the historical period and response to global warming similarly our analysis of anthropogenic forcing relies on global climate models which do not address the topographical complexity that strongly affects precipitation and temperature in the leading sugarcane producing areas of guangxi further research using high resolution modeling methods that better address boundary conditions and fine scale processes diffenbaugh et al 2005 lebassi habtezion et al 2013 and or using an analysis focused on the potential large scale climate dynamics of a single extreme event swain et al 2014 duchˆene et al 2022 thrasher et al 2022 may help overcome the limitations of simulating precipitation and temperature in current global climate models 5 conclusion in this study sugarcane in guangxi china was taken as the research object the spei was selected as the drought identification index of sugarcane and the effects of precipitation deficits and temperature anomalies during different growth periods on drought were analyzed on this basis the impact of climate warming on the degree of drought in sugarcane was revealed and the following conclusions were obtained in terms of time the drought frequency in different growth periods of sugarcane observed in history was similar to that in future scenarios because of the significant frequency of precipitation deficit and warm years in seeding tillering and maturity periods the drought frequency in these three stages is high with the strengthening of the forced emissions scenario the probability of precipitation deficits co occurring with warm conditions and the probability of drought caused by warming increased in terms of spatial change because of climate warming the range of sugarcane growth stages affected by drought is gradually expanding with the highest incidence of drought at maturity tillering and seeding stage drought frequency in the stem elongation and the whole growth period increasing with a decrease in latitude in addition the simultaneous occurrence rate of precipitation deficit and warm years in sugarcane in baise city in the west of the study area was significant the frequency of warm years in the northern high latitude area was high and the potential risk of drought was high it is worth mentioning that global warming may change the lack of precipitation in the southern areas which are currently considered highly suitable for sugarcane planting mainly chongzuo city fangchenggang city and beihai city resulting in a high incidence of drought the guangxi government has made efforts to centralize sugarcane planting improve mechanization and increase planting subsidies to manage and mitigate the impact of drought risk however our research results show that global warming has increased the possibility of sugarcane drought in guangxi and short term drought risk in the sugarcane growth stage is becoming increasingly challenging declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests
