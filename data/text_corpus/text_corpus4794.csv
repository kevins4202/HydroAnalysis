23970,in this study we expand previous large eddy simulation les modeling investigations of langmuir turbulence lt to real ocean conditions using field observations collected under the multi platform field campaign coupled air sea processes and electromagnetic em ducting research casper east the measurement site has strong local variabilities of temperature and salinity and experienced large variations in wind forcing and several cooling events although lt enhances the turbulence in the water column and deepens the mixed layer during most of the simulation period being consistent with previous studies strong reduction of turbulent kinetic energy tke in the mixed layer is observed in the simulation with stokes drift compared to that without stokes drift during a short period analysis of the meteorological forcing and the tke budget have revealed that in the circumstance of swell dominated wave fields with young wind seas the presence of stokes drift reduces shear production more than the stokes production it generates and a reduction of total tke in the mixed layer may be expected whether or not the stokes drift is aligned with the wind weak reduction of tke due to the inclusion of stokes drift is also observed beneath the mixed layer during a cooling event possibly due to the fact that the upwelling associated with langmuir circulation at the base of the mixed layer counteracts on the downwelling associated with the deep convection and reduces the total turbulence level in the water column while both resolved reynold stresses and the bulk eddy viscosity decrease with the increase of wind wave misalignment angle θ w w and become smaller than that in the case without stokes drift when θ w w exceed 60 the subgrid scale sgs part of the momentum flux increases with the increase of θ w w suggesting that the les solutions in cases with large wind wave misalignment become more sensitive to the sgs models used and need to be dealt with caution 1 introduction langmuir turbulence lt is believed to be one of the leading order causes of turbulent mixing in the upper ocean which is important for momentum and heat exchange across the air sea interface and between the mixed layer and the thermocline both observational studies d asaro 2001 2014 and large eddy simulation les investigations li et al 1995 kukulka et al 2009 2010 skylingstad and denbo 1995 mcwilliams et al 1997 hamlington et al 2014 have shown enhanced vertical mixing within the ocean surface boundary layer in the presence of lt through the enhanced vertical turbulent velocity variance the dynamical origin of langmuir circulation is understood as wind driven shear instability in combination with surface wave influences related to their mean lagrangian motion called stokes drift the prevailing theoretical interpretation of langmuir circulation is derived by craik and leibovich 1976 where they introduced the effect of waves on eulerian mean flow into the navier stokes equations even though the theory was developed four decades ago scientists were not able to adequately measure or simulate lt until thirty years ago while les models have been used to simulate langmuir circulation in the upper ocean yielding new insights that could not be obtained from field observations or turbulent closure models most of these studies were conducted under idealized conditions with simplified oceanic and wind conditions skylingstad and denbo 1995 mcwilliams et al 1997 2012 sullivan et al 2012 hamlington et al 2014 reichl et al 2016 idealizing and isolating individual processes makes it easier to study their effects but can also unrealistically magnify or underestimate their impact due to the lack of complex and nonlinear interactions of multiple dynamical processes taking place in the real ocean thus parameterizations that have developed from these idealized studies can have limited practical application in ocean modeling for example evaluation of three of the k profile parameterizations kpp developed by large et al 1994 with lt modifications mcwilliams and sullivan 2000 smyth et al 2002 qiao et al 2004 in the gfdl climate model have shown that none of the schemes give consistent improvement to ocean circulation models globally most likely due to their lack of interaction with ocean physics fan and griffies 2014 while in li et al 2016 and li and fox kemper 2017 substantial improvements are observed when more physical processes are considered in the scaling such as harcourt and d asaro 2008 and van roekel et al 2012 in this study we expand the previous les modeling investigations of lt to real ocean conditions model forcing and initial conditions are obtained from a multi platform field campaign coupled air sea processes and electromagnetic em ducting research casper east that took place off the coast of north carolina in late october to early november of 2015 the study location approximately 63 km east of duct n c is frequently influenced by fresher and cooler water inflow from nearby rivers and bays and warmer and saltier water intrusion from the gulf stream and experienced several cooling events and dramatic turning of wind directions due to storm passage during the observation period temperature t and salinity s profiles surface gravity wave spectra and meteorological forcing data were collected during the casper east campaign providing a rich data set to study the effect of lt on the dynamics and structure of the oceanic mixed layer under complex oceanic and meteorological conditions the outline of this paper is as follows a brief description of the observations during the casper east experiment the les model used for this study and the experiment set up are given in section 2 results are analyzed in section 3 and discussion and concluding remarks are presented in section 4 2 method 2 1 observations the field data used in this research was collected under the casper project aimed to improve the characterization of the propagation of radio frequency signals through the marine atmosphere wang et al 2018a casper east the first of two major field campaigns during the casper project was conducted from october 10 to november 6 of 2015 off the coast of north carolina eastward from the us army corps of engineers field research facility pier at duck atmospheric and oceanic measurements used in this paper were collected around an air sea interaction supersite asi2 established at 36 1837n 75 0451w approximately 63 kilometers east of the shoreline fig 1 due to the effect of near shore cooler and fresher water to the west and warmer and saltier water along the gulf stream gs to the east the research region displays strong local variabilities in temperature and salinity increasing from nearshore towards the gs wang et al 2018a a strong horizontal gradient in sea surface temperature sst is clearly demonstrated by the data collected by the research ship s r v atlantic explorer sbe3s and plotted along the ship track in fig 1 meteorological observations were collected by sensors mounted on the ship s bow mast while the r v remained in vicinity of the study area these include wind speed solar and long wave radiation air and water temperature and relative humidity time varying wind stress latent and sensible heat fluxes fig 2 were calculated from these data using the vectorized coare 3 5 algorithm modified from fairall et al 2003 by woods hole oceanographic institution whoi however because the r v did not always keep stationary near asi2 the resulting time series do not cover the entire time period continuously thus the u s navy s coupled ocean atmosphere mesoscale prediction system coamps hourly forecasts were used as atmospheric forcing for the les model in our experiments coamps is a fully coupled air ocean modeling system that was run in real time to support the casper campaign it features a nested grid configuration with the inner grid having 2 km grid spacing distributed over 70 terrain following vertical levels initial and lateral boundary conditions are supplied by the navy s global operational models navgem for the atmosphere and hycom for the ocean and every 6 h the model fields are updated with local observations coamps treatment of surface fluxes follows the louis 1979 scheme modified to obtain consistency in exchange coefficients and roughness lengths described by coare 3 5 wang et al 2002 as shown in fig 2 all coamps forcing wind stress latent and sensible heat fluxes long short wave radiation matched well with the available observations at asi2 more details on the model design and its performance during casper are provided in ulate et al 2019 detailed two dimensional wave spectra were collected by a scripps miniature wave buoy mwb located at asi2 the buoy was configured to report the directional wave spectrum at 30 min intervals gps 3 axis doppler velocity time series u v w were collected at a 4 hz sampling rate over 1024 samples 4 min 16 s at the beginning of each 30 min period from these velocities two dimensional wave spectra were generated using the maximum entropy method lygre and krogstad 1986 a vertically profiling underwater slocum glider with temperature salinity and turbulence microstructure rockland scientific s microrider probes was deployed to survey the area from october 19 within a short distance from asi2 magenta line in fig 1 due to the large periods of discontinuity in the data during the first 5 days this study only uses data starting from october 24 0utc fig 3 large temporal temperature and salinity variations are observed along the glider track these variations are especially striking in the surface layer where the temperature is reduced by more than 3 degrees and salinity is reduced by almost 4 psu within a 10 day period 2 2 model description the large eddy simulation les model used for this study was first introduced by mcwilliams et al 1997 to study ocean surface boundary layer turbulence by solving the wave phase averaged craik leibovich equations craik and leibovich 1976 the effect of surface gravity waves is included as vortex force stokes coriolis force lagrangian mean advection associated with stokes drift and a wave averaged increment to pressure that arises through conservative wave current interactions the model was further improved by sullivan et al 2007 to include the stokes production in the subgrid tke equations appendix it has been shown to accurately reproduce observed upper ocean responses to different meteorological forcing with simple ocean conditions e g kukulka et al 2009 liang et al 2013 2017 due to its periodic boundary conditions along the horizontal boundaries the les model suffers serious limitations in predicting turbulence in inhomogeneous flow fields such as the casper east research area which displays strong spatial and temporal variabilities in temperature t and salinity s fan et al 2018 introduced a large scale gradient forcing into the les model to account for strong horizontal density gradient across the model domain and demonstrated significant improvement of model skill in simulations within a strong salinity gradient region however such an approach requires continuous t and s measurements at different spatial locations in order to provide the time series of horizontal t and s gradient for the les model since we do not have such vast data sources from the casper east field experiment in order to account for the horizontal advection throughout the water column t and s fields in the model are relaxed towards the glider vertical profile measurements t o b s and s o b s with a relaxation e folding time scale t relax of 30 min to avoid influence of such a treatment on the small scale turbulence in the model we only relax the domain mean t and s towards observations as described below step 1 compute the domain mean t and s vertical profile t z and s z step 2 t and s adjustments are computed using the mean values δ t z t o b s z t z δ t t r e l a x δ s z s o b s z s z δ t t r e l a x where δ t is model time step step 3 mean t and s adjustments are applied to each grid points i j in the model domain t i j z t i j z δ t z s i j z s i j z δ s z 2 3 experiment set up we focus our analysis at station asi2 which has a water depth of 37 96 m the les model is configured on a domain of 150 m 150 m in the horizontal and 37 96 m in vertical directions there are 250 grid points in both horizontal directions with a uniform spacing of 0 6 m the 64 layers of the vertical grid are stretched with a smallest spacing of 0 1 m near the surface to better resolve the boundary layer turbulence mcwilliams et al 2014 and largest spacing of 1 8 m near the bottom the coriolis parameter of 8 6077 10 5 is used in the simulation corresponding to station asi2 s position at 36 1837n periodic boundary conditions are specified for the horizontal directions no normal flow and specified momentum and heat fluxes are applied at the surface and non slip bottom boundary condition is used with roughness length of z o 0 001 m sensitivity to model set up was tested on grid resolution by doubling the number of points used in the vertical or horizontal direction domain size by increasing the horizontal domain to 200 m and 300 m with the same resolution roughness by using alternate values of z o 0 0001 m and 0 01 m and model relaxation time scale by changing it to 1 h and 2 h while quantitative differences were observed in certain statistics such as the total turbulent kinetic energy or turbulent intensity the insights and conclusions obtained in the present study were unchanged all model simulations start from rest model surface forcing of wind stress and net heat fluxes the sum of latent and sensible heat fluxes long short wave radiation are constructed using the assimilated coamps run glider measurements of temperature and salinity from october 23 at 23 58 03 utc to october 24 at 00 01 29 were averaged in time to create the initial condition for the les model on october 24 at 00 00 utc since the location of the glider was within 4 km of asi2 during the entire simulation period we assume the temperature and salinity at asi2 is reasonably represented by the glider measurements and relax the model temperature and salinity towards the glider observations at a relaxation time scale of 30 min such a treatment helps to better resolve the temperature and salinity time variations at the location of interest fig 3 and allows for more accurate turbulence simulations in the water column note that the water depth varies along the glider track within a few meters of the water depth at asi2 the white lines on the les results are mixed layer depth mld defined as the depth where changes of the potential density referenced to surface are less than 0 1 kg m3 this criterion is used for all mld definitions in this article stokes drift profile time series fig 2f were computed from the wave spectra data e f θ collected by the wave buoy at asi2 according to dean and dalrymple 1991 1 u s z 2 g e f θ k c c o s h 2 k h z s i n h 2 k h d f d θ where f θ and k are the frequency direction and wave number vector of the spectra the wave spectra are measured in frequency bands ranging from 0 05 to 1 95 hz the contribution to stokes drift from higher frequencies were shown to be insignificant by fan et al 2018 and kukulka and harcourt 2017 three real case les experiments are conducted at station asi2 using the same ocean conditions and meteorological forcing the only difference among these experiments is in the handling of stokes drift it was calculated from observed wave spectra eq 1 in experiment 1 no stokes drift is used in experiment 2 and the observed stokes drift is artificially aligned with the wind direction in experiment 3 additionally a suite of idealized experiments is conducted to illustrate the effect of wind wave misalignment the setup of these experiments is given in section 3 3 note that observations gargett et al 2004 gargett and wells 2007 kukulka et al 2011 and large eddy simulation studies walker et al 2016 in shallow water of 15 16 m depth have shown that langmuir cells lc can extend throughout the whole water column such lcs were termed langmuir supercells with crosswind scale distance between convergence zones three to six times the water depth strong near bottom intensification of the along wind velocity jets are typically located below downwelling regions and contribute to sediment resuspension tejada martínez and grosch 2007 generalize the definition of shallow water to water depth equals to 1 6 of the dominant wave length and is able to captured these langmuir supercells and intensified jets near the bottom the water depth at our study location is 37 96 m although it is relatively shallow the dominant wave length is well below six times of the water depth during our research period and our les simulations show no velocity intensification near the bottom therefore the mechanism of langmuir supercells are not investigated in this study as we see no evidence of its existence 3 results 3 1 the turbulent kinetic energy tke budget the turbulent kinetic energy tke budget is usually analyzed in previous studies grant and belcher 2009 mcwilliams et al 2012 van roekel et al 2012 to examine the effect of lt on the mixing the horizontal domain averaged tke equation can be written as 2 e t t u r t s h e a r p b u o y p p r s t s t o k e s p ε s g s where t u r t 1 2 u 2 w z v 2 w z w 2 w z is the turbulent transport term s h e a r p u w u z v w v z is the shear production term b u o y p α g θ w β g s w is the buoyancy production term p r s t 1 ρ 0 p w z is the pressure transport term s t o k e s p u w u s x z v w u s y z is the stokes production term e is the total tke ε is the kinetic energy dissipation rate and sgs is the subgrid scale contribution the angle bracket in the above equations represents horizontal domain average the superscript prime denotes a departure from the mean value during most of the 11 day simulation period the presence of stokes drift in experiment 1 enhances the total tke or show comparable magnitude relative to experiment 2 with no stokes drift fig 4 a result consistent with previous studies li et al 1995 skylingstad and denbo 1995 mcwilliams et al 1997 kukulka et al 2009 2010 sullivan et al 2012 rabe et al 2015 however during a 7 hour period from october 29 18 utc to october 30 1 utc a strong reduction in total tke is observed within the mixed layer in experiment 1 when compared with experiment 2 fig 4 contradictory to the studies mentioned earlier this period is highlighted by the vertical gray lines and marked 0 and 1 to indicate the time instances of the event note that tke is only given for 3 days in fig 4 so that the figure is not too busy to highlight the contradictory period in an idealized study van roekel et al 2012 found normalized vertical velocity variance vvv is less than shear only cases in strongly misaligned 135 wind and wave simulations while the reduction of vvv is not observed in the studies under hurricane conditions sullivan et al 2012 rabe et al 2015 wang et al 2018b 2019 where wind wave misalignment is common phenomenon this is more likely due to the fact that the hurricane studies are transient and the wind wave angle in their study only briefly reached 135 or larger however in our study the change of wind forcing is also transient and the wind wave misalignment angle only ranges from 40 to 90 during period 0 to 1 fig 5b what has caused the dramatic reduction of tke during this period the major term in the tke budget eq 2 that have caused the strong reduction in total tke during this period is found to be the shear production which is significantly reduced in experiment 1 especially in the top 2 m or so fig 6a b due to the effect of the langmuir cells and the added anti stokes transport by stokes coriolis force in the along forcing direction the downwind velocity consequently diminishes near surface mcwilliams et al 1997 2012 as a result the mean currents become more uniformly distributed with depth and thus reduces the shear production in the water column although stokes production is introduced into the system in experiment 1 the added extra term is too weak to compensate for the loss of shear production fig 6d as noted earlier the wind wave misalignment angle is large during this period due to storm passage over the casper east region wind directions began rotating clockwise from southerlies shortly before time 0 october 29 18 utc to northerlies by october 30 08 utc fig 5a due to rapidly changing wind direction the corresponding wind waves were young and less developed and the wave field was dominated by swells oriented at large angles with the wind direction resulting in a lag of several hours before the stokes drift and wind directions were aligned again fig 5a b c note that the wind wave angle calculated in fig 5b used surface stokes direction however when we align the stokes drift through the entire water column with the wind direction and rerun the simulation in experiment 3 we see even weaker tke in the mixed layer fig 4c while more reduction in shear production fig 6c is produced due to the further reduction of surface currents the enhancement of stokes production in the mixed layer is very weak although slightly larger than experiment 1 thus the total tke in the surface layer end up to be even smaller than experiment 1 as we can see from fig 5e unlike the previously studied idealized cases that use pure wind sea and strong langmuir turbulence dominance with a turbulent langmuir number l a t u u s 0 where u is the friction velocity and u s 0 is the surface stokes drift equal to 0 3 the l a t in experiment 3 ranges from 0 4 to 0 6 during this period indicating weak langmuir turbulence this is because although the stokes drift is artificially aligned with the wind directions in experiment 3 its magnitude is estimated using the observed wave spectrum due to the dramatic change of wind direction during this period the growth of wind waves is small and the wave field is dominated by swells which have lower wave height and longer wave length compared with wind waves producing smaller stokes drift to further analyze the behavior of vertical mixing among these three experiments the mixed layer averaged vertical velocity variance vvv is compared in fig 7 for the same time period as the total tke according to rabe et al 2015 the les bulk vvv resolved plus sgs contribution is calculated as 3 w t 2 h 1 h h 0 w 2 w s g s 2 d z where h is the mixed layer depth and subscript t represents total vvv including the subgrid scale vvv that is calculated under the assumption of isotropic turbulence it is defined as w s g s 2 2 3 e where e is the subgrid scale tke as we can see the bulk vvv is larger in experiment 1 than experiment 2 during most of the simulation period and aligning the wave direction with wind direction further enhances vvv except for the period from 0 to 1 enlarged in the inset figure of fig 7 when the bulk vvv is larger in experiment 2 than experiment 1 and align the waves with wind direction makes very little difference thus during this period instead of elevated vvv as shown in rabe et al 2015 the addition of the craik leibovich vortex force reduces the vertical mixing from what we see in this section it seems like that for young wind seas with swell domination the effect of stokes drift on reducing shear production is stronger than the stokes production generated by the lt and a reduction of total tke may be expected whether or not the stokes drift is aligned with the wind note that the case studied here is very different from mcwilliams et al 2014 when the authors studied the effect of very strong swells in the same direction as the fully developed wind seas so that the turbulent field is strongly dominated by langmuir turbulence with very small la t 0 11 0 3 both scenarios exist in the real ocean where the wave field is complex and fast varying with different combinations of wind seas and swells fan et al 2014 created by weather patterns that constantly vary both spatially and temporally thus although idealized studies can provide good insights on the effect of langmuir turbulence more real case studies are needed to reveal the full range of effect of langmuir circulation in the ocean 3 2 turbulent intensity while tke is very informative in understanding the change of turbulence due to langmuir circulation ocean circulation models cannot resolve the actual turbulence due to their coarse resolutions and therefore have to parameterize it through eddy viscosity diffusivity that relates the turbulence to the vertical gradient of resolved velocity thus turbulent intensity can be an interesting variable to explore for the casper east experiments it is defined as the magnitude ratio of the velocity fluctuations u v w to the mean flow velocity u v w i u 2 v 2 w 2 3 u 2 v 2 w 2 where the angle bracket represents horizontal domain mean and thus is a measure of the relative degree of turbulence in the fluid the values of the turbulent intensity from the real case les experiments conducted at station asi2 experiment 1 experiment 2 and experiment 3 are compared in fig 8 same as shown in the tke comparison the presence of stokes drift in experiment 1 enhances the turbulence fig 8a relative to experiment 2 fig 8b during most of the 11 day simulation period except time period 0 to 1 notice the significant differences between experiment 1 and 2 beneath the mixed layer since the currents in the mixed layer are much stronger than that beneath the mixed layer and its magnitude is reduced at the same time as the total tke reduction in experiment 1 the turbulent intensity that represents the ratio of these two shows no obvious difference between experiment 1 and 2 in the mixed layer on the other hand while the total tke shows smaller differences between the two experiments beneath the mixed layer fig 4d the differences are amplified in the turbulent intensity by the small differences in the weak currents when we align the stokes drift through the entire water column with the wind direction and rerun the simulation in experiment 3 the turbulent intensity in the new experiment fig 8c is significantly enhanced relative to experiment 1 indicating wind wave misalignment may play an important role when the level of turbulence relative to the mean flow is considered 3 3 the effect of wind wave misalignment on langmuir turbulence a suite of idealized experiments with wind wave misalignment angles range from 0 to 135 is conducted in van roekel et al 2012 to examine the effect of wind wave misalignment on the strength and orientation of the langmuir cells lc a projected langmuir number is suggested that takes into account of the misalignment and an empirical formula is proposed to predict the angle between lc and wind direction while the authors briefly noted the weakening of vertical kinetic energy w 2 with the increase of wind wave misalignment angle and found w 2 to be only slightly different from the profiles found in the shear only case when the mis alignment angle is 135 they did not examine the changes of the turbulence level relative to the mean flow or the changes of eddy viscosity in their study since this information is critical to ocean circulation models a suite of idealized experiments is carried out in this section to investigate the effect of wind wave misalignment on turbulent intensity reynold stress and eddy viscosity in light of van roekel et al 2012 stratified ocean initial conditions are prescribed for the idealized experiments with a constant density layer from the surface to a depth of 20 m below that layer stable stratification of d θ d z 0 01 k m is prescribed with the thermal expansion coefficient α 2 10 4 k 1 constant forcing is applied for all experiments following mcwilliams et al 1997 with wind stress τ 0 037 n m 2 corresponding to a wind speed of about 5 m s 1 a weak heat flux into the ocean of q 5 w m 2 and a stokes drift profile from a sinusoidal wave with an amplitude of 0 8 m and length of 60 m corresponding to stokes drift with surface value of u s 0 068 m s 1 this implies a l a t equals 0 3 the x ˆ direction in the model is defined as the along wind direction seven experiments are conducted as listed in table 1 in which the wind wave angle θ w w is varied from 0 to 120 in 30 increments from experiment i1 to i5 experiment i6 provides a reference case when no stokes drift was present in the simulation the boundary layer environment is uniformly rotating for all experiments with f 8 5867 10 5 s 1 corresponding to 36 17 n latitude the latitude of station asi2 all model runs are spun up from rest to a statistical equilibrium state after one inertial period 20 3 h turbulent intensity time series for two days of model simulation are presented in fig 9 after the first day of model simulation to exclude the turbulence spin up period we note that the turbulence is the strongest with deepest reach when wind and wave is aligned experiment i1 and it gives the largest averaged mld of 33 m during this period while the case without the stokes drift experiment i6 has weaker turbulence and shallower mld of 28 2 m consistent with previous studies note the large values of turbulent intensity red areas beneath the mixed layer is an artifact caused by the extremely small mean current there consistent reduction of turbulence in the water column is observed as θ w w gradually increases from 0 to 120 experiment i1 to i5 not only does the magnitude of turbulent intensity decrease but it is confined to an increasingly shallower layer near the surface even when the winds and waves are misaligned by only 30 experiment i2 fig 9b the magnitude of the turbulent intensity with the presence of stokes drift is already comparable to the case without stokes drift although it still gives a deeper mixed layer the reduction of turbulence in the water column results in shallower mld with increasing θ w w case i3 with θ w w 60 gives a comparable mld as with no stokes drift while further increase in θ w w gives shallower mld than case i6 without strokes drift another set of experiments were conducted using the same ocean conditions and heat flux but with a stronger wind speed of 10 m s 1 and a corresponding stokes drift velocity of 0 135 m s which also implies la t 0f 0 3 the same trend of decreasing turbulence intensity with increasing wind wave angle is observed however there is stronger turbulence in the water column for θ w w 30 when compared with the no stokes drift case this suggests that both the magnitude of the winds and waves and their misalignment angle are important for the impact of stokes drift on the level of turbulence intensity when other conditions are kept the same this difference should not be expected with carefully designed experiments when all controlling non dimensional variables are kept constant to quantify the significance of wind wave misalignment on ocean models we diagnose the scalar eddy viscosity magnitude k m obtained from the reynolds stress and mean shear following mcwilliams et al 2012 4 k m u w z u l where u w is the horizontal domain averaged total reynold stress and u l is the horizontal domain averaged lagrangian velocity mean current plus stokes drift fig 10 shows the bulk eddy viscosity for all 6 experiments all statistics presented here are averaged over one inertial period 20 3 h towards the end of the simulation averaging over alternate inertial periods or several inertial periods were tested and showed no statistical difference as suggested by previous studies mcwilliams et al 1997 when the stokes drift is aligned with the wind directions experiment i1 red solid line k m takes a convex profile shape and is significantly larger than the case without stokes drift experiment i6 black solid line when the stokes drift direction is rotated away from the wind direction the magnitude of k m is reduced although lt still significantly enhances k m with a 30 wind wave misalignment angle on average it adds no apparent turbulence to the water column for a 60 angle and even reduces k m when the misalignment angle is further increased in the along wind direction x direction the structure of the resolved reynold stress u w profiles look qualitatively similar for all cases with significant magnitude and penetration depth differences fig 10a solid lines when the wind wave angle is relatively small up to 30 the lt enhances the magnitude of the reynold stress with deeper penetration in the interior of the boundary layer compared with the shear turbulence only case experiment i6 the lt can still lead to higher magnitude of u w when θ w w reaches 60 degrees but the penetration depth becomes the same as the non stokes case further increase of θ w w leads to a significant decrease in both the magnitude and penetration depth of the resolved momentum flux since the subgrid scale sgs part of the momentum flux given in appendix is a function of the strain tensor its vertical profiles are strongly dependent on the vertical shear of the resolved velocity components which are given in fig 11 the magnitude of both the along and cross wind eulerian velocities increase sharply with θ w w become increasingly confined to the surface layer and their vertical shear significantly overwhelms the vertical shear from the stokes drift thus the maximum values of the sgs momentum flux in the along wind direction are found near surface where the strongest mean velocity shear is located and increase significantly with the increase of θ w w the penetration depth of the sgs momentum flux also increases significantly with the increase of θ w w from very close to the water surface when the wind wave misalignment is within 60 to 20 of the total boundary layer depth when θ w w reaches 120 note that when θ w w reaches 120 the sgs portion exceeds the resolved portion of the total momentum flux in the upper boundary layer thus indicating the flow regime becomes dominated more by small scale motion and that the les solutions are more sensitive to the sgs models used in the cross wind direction y direction the structure of the resolved reynold stress v w profiles also look qualitatively similar for all cases with significant magnitude and penetration depth reductions due to the increase of θ w w fig 10b however when θ w w reaches 60 the magnitude of the resolved momentum flux becomes much smaller than the case without stokes drift while the magnitude of the resolved momentum flux continues to reduce with the increase of θ w w the level of reduction is weaker compared with the along wind component while the cross wind sgs momentum fluxes appear to have their maximum values at the surface as the along wind components when θ w w is less than 90 the profiles start to show a convex shape structure when θ w w is equal to or larger than 90 the maximum of the fluxes is found below the surface and it becomes deeper with a larger magnitude as θ w w further increases this is owing to the slight curvature in the mean cross wind velocity v near the surface fig 11b that reduces the vertical shear the wind wave misalignment directly impacts both the resolved and subgrid scale energy since their balance equation includes a stokes production term van roekel et al 2012 studied the effect of misalignment on the tke budget in detail and found that the primary balance within the tke budget is between stokes shear production and the sgs terms and it undergoes significant changes as θ w w increases for small θ w w the primary balance is between the stokes shear production in the along wind direction and the sgs terms as θ w w increases the stokes shear decreases in along wind direction while increases slowly in the cross wind direction our model results are consistent with these findings and thus not shown here note that pearson 2018 showed that the use of sgs model in les simulation with stokes drift leads to an artificial tke production close to the surface when the wind wave angle is close to 90 at the equator since our simulation is conducted at mid latitude 36 1837 o n that effect is likely minimal 3 4 interaction between langmuir turbulence and deep convection in the real case simulations at station asi2 discussed in sections 3 1 and 3 2 during a 7 hour period from october 29 18 utc to october 30 1 utc we not only observed a strong reduction of tke in the mixed layer due to the inclusion of stokes drift in experiment 1 fig 4a but also noticed reduction of tke beneath the mixed layer fig 4d this reduction of tke beneath the mixed layer became stronger after we aligned the wind and waves in experiment 3 fig 4e as discussed in section 3 1 although the stokes drift is artificially aligned with the wind directions in experiment 3 its magnitude is smaller than fully developed wind seas due to young under developed wind waves and swell dominance in the wave field thus the turbulent langmuir number l a t is large 0 4 1 in experiment 3 fig 5e while the hoenikker number ho 4 b 0 u s β u 2 where b 0 is the surface buoyancy flux and β is the stokes drift current e folding depth is still less than 1 the critical value for transition from lt to convective turbulence min and noh 2004 li et al 2005 its magnitude fig 5f is much larger than typical values of o 0 01 found in idealized experiments dominated by lt li et al 2005 thus both metrics suggest a turbulence regime with combined lt and convective plumes at the asi2 research site several hours before time 0 october 29 18 utc there is an intrusion of warmer and saltier water in the upper layers fig 3 that has increased the density of the surface water and reduced the mixed layer depth with heavier water overlay on lighter water fig 12a while the unstable structure has led to active turbulent mixing to efficiently mix this dense water downward and deepen the mixed layer by time 0 the continuous intrusion of warmer and saltier water together with the strong cooling event that starts at time 0 fig 5d has significantly increased the density in the surface water and reduced the mixed layer depth to just 5 7 m although some fresher water was introduced to the system a few hours later fig 3 that has reduced the density of the surface water fig 12a another intrusion of saltier water together with strong cooling event a few hours later densifies the surface water and shallows the mixed layer again we can clearly see these heavy waters propagate down the water column in fig 12a notice that the event with lower turbulent intensity in the langmuir case experiment 1 and 3 happens beneath the mixed layer and coincide with joint events of mixed layer shallowing due to warmer and saltier water inflow and the surface cooling caused by meteorology events we compare the model results between experiment 2 and 3 in fig 13 to unveil the effect of lt during these cooling events by taking a close look at the magnitude of the vertical turbulent velocity w and the vertical velocity skewness following mcwilliams et al 1997 definition 5 γ w 3 w 2 3 2 where the angle brackets represent the horizontal domain average from time 0 to time 1 the intrusion of warmer and saltier water together with the strong cooling event that starts at time 0 fig 5d has significantly increased the density in the surface water and reduced the mixed layer depth to just 5 7 m while this dense water is mixed down the water column fresher water inflow fig 3 has created a light layer near surface and a dense layer end up sandwiched in between of two light layers fig 12a a prominent feature during this period is the strong vertical velocity w beneath the mixed layer which is associated with large negative γ values for both experiments 2 and 3 fig 13 according to sullivan et al 2007 negative values of γ are indicative of strong short lived downwelling events alternating with weaker longer lived upwelling events and can thus be used to indicate the presence of langmuir circulation or unstable convection since the w values are much weaker in the mixed layer and there is heavy water at a depth of 5 m overlay on lighter water in the water column fig 12 the large w values beneath the mixed layer have to be associated with deep convection plumes notice that the heavy water near the base of the mixed layer light orange color is thicker in experiment 3 fig 12c compared with experiment 2 fig 12b since the tke in experiment 2 is much stronger than experiment 3 in the mixed layer fig 4 it is natural to think that the enhanced tke has led to the thinner layer of heavy water in experiment 2 however enhanced tke in the mixed layer should erode the part of the heavier water above the mixed layer base not below as we observed in fig 12 thus another explanation is attempted here on the interaction between langmuir circulation and deep convection at the base of the mixed layer we observe reduced w near the base of the mixed layer and below the mixed layer depth associated with reduced magnitude in negative γ in experiment 3 indicating weaker convection plumes what happens here could be that the well organized upwelling associated with langmuir cells has weakened the downward propagation of the denser water weaker w around the base of the mixed layer in experiment 3 fig 13c and lead to a thicker dense water layer below and above lighter water at the base of the mixed layer in experiment 3 compared with experiment 2 fig 12c and b since the enhanced upwelling is counter acting on the downwelling associated with the deep convection beneath the mixed layer it reduced the overall turbulence level beneath the mixed layer 4 summary and discussions langmuir turbulence lt is believed to be one of the leading causes of turbulent mixing in the upper ocean li et al 1995 skylingstad and denbo 1995 kukulka et al 2009 2010 mcwilliams et al 1997 hamlington et al 2014 large eddy simulation les models that solve the craik leibovich equations are used to study lt yielding new insights that could not be obtained from field observations or turbulent closure models alone however these studies have been mostly conducted under idealized conditions in this study we expand our previous les modeling investigations of lt to the real ocean with complex oceanic and meteorological conditions data collected through a multi platform field campaign coupled air sea processes and electromagnetic em ducting research casper east are used for the les simulations this onr funded field study took place off the coast of north carolina in late october to early november of 2015 the study area is constantly influenced by inflows of fresher and colder water from nearby rivers and bays and warmer and saltier water along the gulf stream and experienced several cooling events and dramatic turning of wind directions due to a passing storm during the observation period ocean temperature t salinity s and directional surface gravity wave spectrum were collected together with atmospheric measurements providing a rich data set to study the effects of lt on the dynamics and structure of the oceanic mixed layer under complicated oceanic and meteorological conditions in order to account for the effect of strong local variability in t and s while restricted to periodic horizontal boundary conditions model t and s are relaxed toward glider measurements with a relaxation e folding time scale of 30 min the stokes drift profile time series were computed from the two dimensional wave spectra collected by a scripps miniature wave buoy mwb located at station asi2 and temporally evolving atmospheric forcing was provided from hourly forecasts using the coamps coupled mesoscale model during most of the simulation period lt enhances the turbulence in the water column and deepens the mixed layer being consistent with previous studies li et al 1995 kukulka et al 2009 2010 skylingstad and denbo 1995 mcwilliams et al 1997 hamlington et al 2014 however significant reduction in turbulent kinetic energy tke and turbulent intensity i u 2 v 2 w 2 3 u 2 v 2 w 2 are observed in the simulation with stokes drift compared to one without during a short period contradicting the commonly accepted concept that lt significantly enhances turbulent mixing in the water column analysis of the meteorology forcing and the tke budget have revealed that in the circumstance of swell dominated wave fields with young under developed wind seas the effect of stokes drift on reducing shear production is stronger than the stokes production generated by the lt and a reduction of total tke may be expected whether or not the stokes drift is aligned with the wind since the ocean waves are complex and fast varying with different combinations of wind seas and swells created by weather patterns that constantly vary both spatially and temporally both the wave condition studied here and the scenario that consists of very strong swells in the same direction as the fully developed wind seas studied in mcwilliams et al 2014 exist in the real ocean thus while idealized studies are good tools for us to gain more understanding of the effect of langmuir turbulence conducting real case studies are critical to reveal the full range of effect of langmuir circulation in the ocean a suite of idealized experiments is conducted to investigate the effect of wind wave misalignment angle θ w w on lt consistent reduction of turbulent intensity in the water column and shallowing of the mixed layer depth is observed with the increase of θ w w the wind wave misalignment also traps the momentum in a shallower surface layer thus producing large mean surface currents leading to a further reduction in the turbulent intensity both the magnitude of the wind and waves and their misalignment angle are found to be important for the impact of stokes drift on the level of turbulence in the water column while both resolved reynold stresses in the along and cross wind directions and the bulk eddy viscosity decrease with an increase in θ w w the subgrid scale sgs part of the momentum flux increases with the increase of θ w w this is because the sgs momentum flux is a function of the strain tensor its vertical profiles are strongly dependent on the vertical shear of the resolved velocity components which sharply increase with θ w w in the near surface layer in both along and cross wind directions the model results also suggest that the turbulence regime becomes dominated more by small scale motion with increasing θ w w and thus suggesting that the les solutions in cases with large wind wave misalignment become more sensitive to the sgs models used when stokes drift has a component in the opposite direction of the wind it creates a sink term for the tke and affect the sub grid scale turbulence behavior in the stable boundary layer in a way that is not very well understood thus we recommend caution in interpolating these results and more detailed studies are needed to gain full confidence on the sub grid model in large wind wave misaligned cases in the casper east simulations reduction of turbulence due to the presence of surface gravity waves are also found during a cooling event that coincide with the intrusion of warmer and saltier water by the gulf stream these changes of environmental conditions have led to a special dynamical structure in the water column with a layer of denser water sandwiched in between of two layers of light water a possible explanation could be that the well organized upwelling associated with langmuir cells weakens the downward propagation of the denser water and thus creates a thicker density barrier at the base of the mixed layer compared to the non lt case the enhanced upwelling due to lt has reduced the occurrence of deep convection beneath the mixed layer and consequently reduces the overall turbulence in the water column although this type of density structure in the water column is not commonly observed it demonstrates one of the complexities encountered in the real ocean resulting from nonlinear interactions between lt and dynamical processes that have been absent in previous idealized les modeling studies although many ocean models simulate temperature and salinity profiles nowadays correct representation of the dynamics is still needed to obtain accurate turbulence in the water column as demonstrated by these capser east simulations even if the model relaxes its temperature and salinity towards observations the turbulence in the water column is still very different with and without the presence of surface gravity waves since available ocean observations are very limited both spatially and temporally good representation of the turbulence in the water column is still critical for ocean models especially for the transfer of heat momentum and gas within the oceanic boundary layer better understanding of the nonlinear interaction between lt and complicated ocean dynamics and meteorological forcing is needed to correctly represent their effects on ocean

23970,in this study we expand previous large eddy simulation les modeling investigations of langmuir turbulence lt to real ocean conditions using field observations collected under the multi platform field campaign coupled air sea processes and electromagnetic em ducting research casper east the measurement site has strong local variabilities of temperature and salinity and experienced large variations in wind forcing and several cooling events although lt enhances the turbulence in the water column and deepens the mixed layer during most of the simulation period being consistent with previous studies strong reduction of turbulent kinetic energy tke in the mixed layer is observed in the simulation with stokes drift compared to that without stokes drift during a short period analysis of the meteorological forcing and the tke budget have revealed that in the circumstance of swell dominated wave fields with young wind seas the presence of stokes drift reduces shear production more than the stokes production it generates and a reduction of total tke in the mixed layer may be expected whether or not the stokes drift is aligned with the wind weak reduction of tke due to the inclusion of stokes drift is also observed beneath the mixed layer during a cooling event possibly due to the fact that the upwelling associated with langmuir circulation at the base of the mixed layer counteracts on the downwelling associated with the deep convection and reduces the total turbulence level in the water column while both resolved reynold stresses and the bulk eddy viscosity decrease with the increase of wind wave misalignment angle θ w w and become smaller than that in the case without stokes drift when θ w w exceed 60 the subgrid scale sgs part of the momentum flux increases with the increase of θ w w suggesting that the les solutions in cases with large wind wave misalignment become more sensitive to the sgs models used and need to be dealt with caution 1 introduction langmuir turbulence lt is believed to be one of the leading order causes of turbulent mixing in the upper ocean which is important for momentum and heat exchange across the air sea interface and between the mixed layer and the thermocline both observational studies d asaro 2001 2014 and large eddy simulation les investigations li et al 1995 kukulka et al 2009 2010 skylingstad and denbo 1995 mcwilliams et al 1997 hamlington et al 2014 have shown enhanced vertical mixing within the ocean surface boundary layer in the presence of lt through the enhanced vertical turbulent velocity variance the dynamical origin of langmuir circulation is understood as wind driven shear instability in combination with surface wave influences related to their mean lagrangian motion called stokes drift the prevailing theoretical interpretation of langmuir circulation is derived by craik and leibovich 1976 where they introduced the effect of waves on eulerian mean flow into the navier stokes equations even though the theory was developed four decades ago scientists were not able to adequately measure or simulate lt until thirty years ago while les models have been used to simulate langmuir circulation in the upper ocean yielding new insights that could not be obtained from field observations or turbulent closure models most of these studies were conducted under idealized conditions with simplified oceanic and wind conditions skylingstad and denbo 1995 mcwilliams et al 1997 2012 sullivan et al 2012 hamlington et al 2014 reichl et al 2016 idealizing and isolating individual processes makes it easier to study their effects but can also unrealistically magnify or underestimate their impact due to the lack of complex and nonlinear interactions of multiple dynamical processes taking place in the real ocean thus parameterizations that have developed from these idealized studies can have limited practical application in ocean modeling for example evaluation of three of the k profile parameterizations kpp developed by large et al 1994 with lt modifications mcwilliams and sullivan 2000 smyth et al 2002 qiao et al 2004 in the gfdl climate model have shown that none of the schemes give consistent improvement to ocean circulation models globally most likely due to their lack of interaction with ocean physics fan and griffies 2014 while in li et al 2016 and li and fox kemper 2017 substantial improvements are observed when more physical processes are considered in the scaling such as harcourt and d asaro 2008 and van roekel et al 2012 in this study we expand the previous les modeling investigations of lt to real ocean conditions model forcing and initial conditions are obtained from a multi platform field campaign coupled air sea processes and electromagnetic em ducting research casper east that took place off the coast of north carolina in late october to early november of 2015 the study location approximately 63 km east of duct n c is frequently influenced by fresher and cooler water inflow from nearby rivers and bays and warmer and saltier water intrusion from the gulf stream and experienced several cooling events and dramatic turning of wind directions due to storm passage during the observation period temperature t and salinity s profiles surface gravity wave spectra and meteorological forcing data were collected during the casper east campaign providing a rich data set to study the effect of lt on the dynamics and structure of the oceanic mixed layer under complex oceanic and meteorological conditions the outline of this paper is as follows a brief description of the observations during the casper east experiment the les model used for this study and the experiment set up are given in section 2 results are analyzed in section 3 and discussion and concluding remarks are presented in section 4 2 method 2 1 observations the field data used in this research was collected under the casper project aimed to improve the characterization of the propagation of radio frequency signals through the marine atmosphere wang et al 2018a casper east the first of two major field campaigns during the casper project was conducted from october 10 to november 6 of 2015 off the coast of north carolina eastward from the us army corps of engineers field research facility pier at duck atmospheric and oceanic measurements used in this paper were collected around an air sea interaction supersite asi2 established at 36 1837n 75 0451w approximately 63 kilometers east of the shoreline fig 1 due to the effect of near shore cooler and fresher water to the west and warmer and saltier water along the gulf stream gs to the east the research region displays strong local variabilities in temperature and salinity increasing from nearshore towards the gs wang et al 2018a a strong horizontal gradient in sea surface temperature sst is clearly demonstrated by the data collected by the research ship s r v atlantic explorer sbe3s and plotted along the ship track in fig 1 meteorological observations were collected by sensors mounted on the ship s bow mast while the r v remained in vicinity of the study area these include wind speed solar and long wave radiation air and water temperature and relative humidity time varying wind stress latent and sensible heat fluxes fig 2 were calculated from these data using the vectorized coare 3 5 algorithm modified from fairall et al 2003 by woods hole oceanographic institution whoi however because the r v did not always keep stationary near asi2 the resulting time series do not cover the entire time period continuously thus the u s navy s coupled ocean atmosphere mesoscale prediction system coamps hourly forecasts were used as atmospheric forcing for the les model in our experiments coamps is a fully coupled air ocean modeling system that was run in real time to support the casper campaign it features a nested grid configuration with the inner grid having 2 km grid spacing distributed over 70 terrain following vertical levels initial and lateral boundary conditions are supplied by the navy s global operational models navgem for the atmosphere and hycom for the ocean and every 6 h the model fields are updated with local observations coamps treatment of surface fluxes follows the louis 1979 scheme modified to obtain consistency in exchange coefficients and roughness lengths described by coare 3 5 wang et al 2002 as shown in fig 2 all coamps forcing wind stress latent and sensible heat fluxes long short wave radiation matched well with the available observations at asi2 more details on the model design and its performance during casper are provided in ulate et al 2019 detailed two dimensional wave spectra were collected by a scripps miniature wave buoy mwb located at asi2 the buoy was configured to report the directional wave spectrum at 30 min intervals gps 3 axis doppler velocity time series u v w were collected at a 4 hz sampling rate over 1024 samples 4 min 16 s at the beginning of each 30 min period from these velocities two dimensional wave spectra were generated using the maximum entropy method lygre and krogstad 1986 a vertically profiling underwater slocum glider with temperature salinity and turbulence microstructure rockland scientific s microrider probes was deployed to survey the area from october 19 within a short distance from asi2 magenta line in fig 1 due to the large periods of discontinuity in the data during the first 5 days this study only uses data starting from october 24 0utc fig 3 large temporal temperature and salinity variations are observed along the glider track these variations are especially striking in the surface layer where the temperature is reduced by more than 3 degrees and salinity is reduced by almost 4 psu within a 10 day period 2 2 model description the large eddy simulation les model used for this study was first introduced by mcwilliams et al 1997 to study ocean surface boundary layer turbulence by solving the wave phase averaged craik leibovich equations craik and leibovich 1976 the effect of surface gravity waves is included as vortex force stokes coriolis force lagrangian mean advection associated with stokes drift and a wave averaged increment to pressure that arises through conservative wave current interactions the model was further improved by sullivan et al 2007 to include the stokes production in the subgrid tke equations appendix it has been shown to accurately reproduce observed upper ocean responses to different meteorological forcing with simple ocean conditions e g kukulka et al 2009 liang et al 2013 2017 due to its periodic boundary conditions along the horizontal boundaries the les model suffers serious limitations in predicting turbulence in inhomogeneous flow fields such as the casper east research area which displays strong spatial and temporal variabilities in temperature t and salinity s fan et al 2018 introduced a large scale gradient forcing into the les model to account for strong horizontal density gradient across the model domain and demonstrated significant improvement of model skill in simulations within a strong salinity gradient region however such an approach requires continuous t and s measurements at different spatial locations in order to provide the time series of horizontal t and s gradient for the les model since we do not have such vast data sources from the casper east field experiment in order to account for the horizontal advection throughout the water column t and s fields in the model are relaxed towards the glider vertical profile measurements t o b s and s o b s with a relaxation e folding time scale t relax of 30 min to avoid influence of such a treatment on the small scale turbulence in the model we only relax the domain mean t and s towards observations as described below step 1 compute the domain mean t and s vertical profile t z and s z step 2 t and s adjustments are computed using the mean values δ t z t o b s z t z δ t t r e l a x δ s z s o b s z s z δ t t r e l a x where δ t is model time step step 3 mean t and s adjustments are applied to each grid points i j in the model domain t i j z t i j z δ t z s i j z s i j z δ s z 2 3 experiment set up we focus our analysis at station asi2 which has a water depth of 37 96 m the les model is configured on a domain of 150 m 150 m in the horizontal and 37 96 m in vertical directions there are 250 grid points in both horizontal directions with a uniform spacing of 0 6 m the 64 layers of the vertical grid are stretched with a smallest spacing of 0 1 m near the surface to better resolve the boundary layer turbulence mcwilliams et al 2014 and largest spacing of 1 8 m near the bottom the coriolis parameter of 8 6077 10 5 is used in the simulation corresponding to station asi2 s position at 36 1837n periodic boundary conditions are specified for the horizontal directions no normal flow and specified momentum and heat fluxes are applied at the surface and non slip bottom boundary condition is used with roughness length of z o 0 001 m sensitivity to model set up was tested on grid resolution by doubling the number of points used in the vertical or horizontal direction domain size by increasing the horizontal domain to 200 m and 300 m with the same resolution roughness by using alternate values of z o 0 0001 m and 0 01 m and model relaxation time scale by changing it to 1 h and 2 h while quantitative differences were observed in certain statistics such as the total turbulent kinetic energy or turbulent intensity the insights and conclusions obtained in the present study were unchanged all model simulations start from rest model surface forcing of wind stress and net heat fluxes the sum of latent and sensible heat fluxes long short wave radiation are constructed using the assimilated coamps run glider measurements of temperature and salinity from october 23 at 23 58 03 utc to october 24 at 00 01 29 were averaged in time to create the initial condition for the les model on october 24 at 00 00 utc since the location of the glider was within 4 km of asi2 during the entire simulation period we assume the temperature and salinity at asi2 is reasonably represented by the glider measurements and relax the model temperature and salinity towards the glider observations at a relaxation time scale of 30 min such a treatment helps to better resolve the temperature and salinity time variations at the location of interest fig 3 and allows for more accurate turbulence simulations in the water column note that the water depth varies along the glider track within a few meters of the water depth at asi2 the white lines on the les results are mixed layer depth mld defined as the depth where changes of the potential density referenced to surface are less than 0 1 kg m3 this criterion is used for all mld definitions in this article stokes drift profile time series fig 2f were computed from the wave spectra data e f θ collected by the wave buoy at asi2 according to dean and dalrymple 1991 1 u s z 2 g e f θ k c c o s h 2 k h z s i n h 2 k h d f d θ where f θ and k are the frequency direction and wave number vector of the spectra the wave spectra are measured in frequency bands ranging from 0 05 to 1 95 hz the contribution to stokes drift from higher frequencies were shown to be insignificant by fan et al 2018 and kukulka and harcourt 2017 three real case les experiments are conducted at station asi2 using the same ocean conditions and meteorological forcing the only difference among these experiments is in the handling of stokes drift it was calculated from observed wave spectra eq 1 in experiment 1 no stokes drift is used in experiment 2 and the observed stokes drift is artificially aligned with the wind direction in experiment 3 additionally a suite of idealized experiments is conducted to illustrate the effect of wind wave misalignment the setup of these experiments is given in section 3 3 note that observations gargett et al 2004 gargett and wells 2007 kukulka et al 2011 and large eddy simulation studies walker et al 2016 in shallow water of 15 16 m depth have shown that langmuir cells lc can extend throughout the whole water column such lcs were termed langmuir supercells with crosswind scale distance between convergence zones three to six times the water depth strong near bottom intensification of the along wind velocity jets are typically located below downwelling regions and contribute to sediment resuspension tejada martínez and grosch 2007 generalize the definition of shallow water to water depth equals to 1 6 of the dominant wave length and is able to captured these langmuir supercells and intensified jets near the bottom the water depth at our study location is 37 96 m although it is relatively shallow the dominant wave length is well below six times of the water depth during our research period and our les simulations show no velocity intensification near the bottom therefore the mechanism of langmuir supercells are not investigated in this study as we see no evidence of its existence 3 results 3 1 the turbulent kinetic energy tke budget the turbulent kinetic energy tke budget is usually analyzed in previous studies grant and belcher 2009 mcwilliams et al 2012 van roekel et al 2012 to examine the effect of lt on the mixing the horizontal domain averaged tke equation can be written as 2 e t t u r t s h e a r p b u o y p p r s t s t o k e s p ε s g s where t u r t 1 2 u 2 w z v 2 w z w 2 w z is the turbulent transport term s h e a r p u w u z v w v z is the shear production term b u o y p α g θ w β g s w is the buoyancy production term p r s t 1 ρ 0 p w z is the pressure transport term s t o k e s p u w u s x z v w u s y z is the stokes production term e is the total tke ε is the kinetic energy dissipation rate and sgs is the subgrid scale contribution the angle bracket in the above equations represents horizontal domain average the superscript prime denotes a departure from the mean value during most of the 11 day simulation period the presence of stokes drift in experiment 1 enhances the total tke or show comparable magnitude relative to experiment 2 with no stokes drift fig 4 a result consistent with previous studies li et al 1995 skylingstad and denbo 1995 mcwilliams et al 1997 kukulka et al 2009 2010 sullivan et al 2012 rabe et al 2015 however during a 7 hour period from october 29 18 utc to october 30 1 utc a strong reduction in total tke is observed within the mixed layer in experiment 1 when compared with experiment 2 fig 4 contradictory to the studies mentioned earlier this period is highlighted by the vertical gray lines and marked 0 and 1 to indicate the time instances of the event note that tke is only given for 3 days in fig 4 so that the figure is not too busy to highlight the contradictory period in an idealized study van roekel et al 2012 found normalized vertical velocity variance vvv is less than shear only cases in strongly misaligned 135 wind and wave simulations while the reduction of vvv is not observed in the studies under hurricane conditions sullivan et al 2012 rabe et al 2015 wang et al 2018b 2019 where wind wave misalignment is common phenomenon this is more likely due to the fact that the hurricane studies are transient and the wind wave angle in their study only briefly reached 135 or larger however in our study the change of wind forcing is also transient and the wind wave misalignment angle only ranges from 40 to 90 during period 0 to 1 fig 5b what has caused the dramatic reduction of tke during this period the major term in the tke budget eq 2 that have caused the strong reduction in total tke during this period is found to be the shear production which is significantly reduced in experiment 1 especially in the top 2 m or so fig 6a b due to the effect of the langmuir cells and the added anti stokes transport by stokes coriolis force in the along forcing direction the downwind velocity consequently diminishes near surface mcwilliams et al 1997 2012 as a result the mean currents become more uniformly distributed with depth and thus reduces the shear production in the water column although stokes production is introduced into the system in experiment 1 the added extra term is too weak to compensate for the loss of shear production fig 6d as noted earlier the wind wave misalignment angle is large during this period due to storm passage over the casper east region wind directions began rotating clockwise from southerlies shortly before time 0 october 29 18 utc to northerlies by october 30 08 utc fig 5a due to rapidly changing wind direction the corresponding wind waves were young and less developed and the wave field was dominated by swells oriented at large angles with the wind direction resulting in a lag of several hours before the stokes drift and wind directions were aligned again fig 5a b c note that the wind wave angle calculated in fig 5b used surface stokes direction however when we align the stokes drift through the entire water column with the wind direction and rerun the simulation in experiment 3 we see even weaker tke in the mixed layer fig 4c while more reduction in shear production fig 6c is produced due to the further reduction of surface currents the enhancement of stokes production in the mixed layer is very weak although slightly larger than experiment 1 thus the total tke in the surface layer end up to be even smaller than experiment 1 as we can see from fig 5e unlike the previously studied idealized cases that use pure wind sea and strong langmuir turbulence dominance with a turbulent langmuir number l a t u u s 0 where u is the friction velocity and u s 0 is the surface stokes drift equal to 0 3 the l a t in experiment 3 ranges from 0 4 to 0 6 during this period indicating weak langmuir turbulence this is because although the stokes drift is artificially aligned with the wind directions in experiment 3 its magnitude is estimated using the observed wave spectrum due to the dramatic change of wind direction during this period the growth of wind waves is small and the wave field is dominated by swells which have lower wave height and longer wave length compared with wind waves producing smaller stokes drift to further analyze the behavior of vertical mixing among these three experiments the mixed layer averaged vertical velocity variance vvv is compared in fig 7 for the same time period as the total tke according to rabe et al 2015 the les bulk vvv resolved plus sgs contribution is calculated as 3 w t 2 h 1 h h 0 w 2 w s g s 2 d z where h is the mixed layer depth and subscript t represents total vvv including the subgrid scale vvv that is calculated under the assumption of isotropic turbulence it is defined as w s g s 2 2 3 e where e is the subgrid scale tke as we can see the bulk vvv is larger in experiment 1 than experiment 2 during most of the simulation period and aligning the wave direction with wind direction further enhances vvv except for the period from 0 to 1 enlarged in the inset figure of fig 7 when the bulk vvv is larger in experiment 2 than experiment 1 and align the waves with wind direction makes very little difference thus during this period instead of elevated vvv as shown in rabe et al 2015 the addition of the craik leibovich vortex force reduces the vertical mixing from what we see in this section it seems like that for young wind seas with swell domination the effect of stokes drift on reducing shear production is stronger than the stokes production generated by the lt and a reduction of total tke may be expected whether or not the stokes drift is aligned with the wind note that the case studied here is very different from mcwilliams et al 2014 when the authors studied the effect of very strong swells in the same direction as the fully developed wind seas so that the turbulent field is strongly dominated by langmuir turbulence with very small la t 0 11 0 3 both scenarios exist in the real ocean where the wave field is complex and fast varying with different combinations of wind seas and swells fan et al 2014 created by weather patterns that constantly vary both spatially and temporally thus although idealized studies can provide good insights on the effect of langmuir turbulence more real case studies are needed to reveal the full range of effect of langmuir circulation in the ocean 3 2 turbulent intensity while tke is very informative in understanding the change of turbulence due to langmuir circulation ocean circulation models cannot resolve the actual turbulence due to their coarse resolutions and therefore have to parameterize it through eddy viscosity diffusivity that relates the turbulence to the vertical gradient of resolved velocity thus turbulent intensity can be an interesting variable to explore for the casper east experiments it is defined as the magnitude ratio of the velocity fluctuations u v w to the mean flow velocity u v w i u 2 v 2 w 2 3 u 2 v 2 w 2 where the angle bracket represents horizontal domain mean and thus is a measure of the relative degree of turbulence in the fluid the values of the turbulent intensity from the real case les experiments conducted at station asi2 experiment 1 experiment 2 and experiment 3 are compared in fig 8 same as shown in the tke comparison the presence of stokes drift in experiment 1 enhances the turbulence fig 8a relative to experiment 2 fig 8b during most of the 11 day simulation period except time period 0 to 1 notice the significant differences between experiment 1 and 2 beneath the mixed layer since the currents in the mixed layer are much stronger than that beneath the mixed layer and its magnitude is reduced at the same time as the total tke reduction in experiment 1 the turbulent intensity that represents the ratio of these two shows no obvious difference between experiment 1 and 2 in the mixed layer on the other hand while the total tke shows smaller differences between the two experiments beneath the mixed layer fig 4d the differences are amplified in the turbulent intensity by the small differences in the weak currents when we align the stokes drift through the entire water column with the wind direction and rerun the simulation in experiment 3 the turbulent intensity in the new experiment fig 8c is significantly enhanced relative to experiment 1 indicating wind wave misalignment may play an important role when the level of turbulence relative to the mean flow is considered 3 3 the effect of wind wave misalignment on langmuir turbulence a suite of idealized experiments with wind wave misalignment angles range from 0 to 135 is conducted in van roekel et al 2012 to examine the effect of wind wave misalignment on the strength and orientation of the langmuir cells lc a projected langmuir number is suggested that takes into account of the misalignment and an empirical formula is proposed to predict the angle between lc and wind direction while the authors briefly noted the weakening of vertical kinetic energy w 2 with the increase of wind wave misalignment angle and found w 2 to be only slightly different from the profiles found in the shear only case when the mis alignment angle is 135 they did not examine the changes of the turbulence level relative to the mean flow or the changes of eddy viscosity in their study since this information is critical to ocean circulation models a suite of idealized experiments is carried out in this section to investigate the effect of wind wave misalignment on turbulent intensity reynold stress and eddy viscosity in light of van roekel et al 2012 stratified ocean initial conditions are prescribed for the idealized experiments with a constant density layer from the surface to a depth of 20 m below that layer stable stratification of d θ d z 0 01 k m is prescribed with the thermal expansion coefficient α 2 10 4 k 1 constant forcing is applied for all experiments following mcwilliams et al 1997 with wind stress τ 0 037 n m 2 corresponding to a wind speed of about 5 m s 1 a weak heat flux into the ocean of q 5 w m 2 and a stokes drift profile from a sinusoidal wave with an amplitude of 0 8 m and length of 60 m corresponding to stokes drift with surface value of u s 0 068 m s 1 this implies a l a t equals 0 3 the x ˆ direction in the model is defined as the along wind direction seven experiments are conducted as listed in table 1 in which the wind wave angle θ w w is varied from 0 to 120 in 30 increments from experiment i1 to i5 experiment i6 provides a reference case when no stokes drift was present in the simulation the boundary layer environment is uniformly rotating for all experiments with f 8 5867 10 5 s 1 corresponding to 36 17 n latitude the latitude of station asi2 all model runs are spun up from rest to a statistical equilibrium state after one inertial period 20 3 h turbulent intensity time series for two days of model simulation are presented in fig 9 after the first day of model simulation to exclude the turbulence spin up period we note that the turbulence is the strongest with deepest reach when wind and wave is aligned experiment i1 and it gives the largest averaged mld of 33 m during this period while the case without the stokes drift experiment i6 has weaker turbulence and shallower mld of 28 2 m consistent with previous studies note the large values of turbulent intensity red areas beneath the mixed layer is an artifact caused by the extremely small mean current there consistent reduction of turbulence in the water column is observed as θ w w gradually increases from 0 to 120 experiment i1 to i5 not only does the magnitude of turbulent intensity decrease but it is confined to an increasingly shallower layer near the surface even when the winds and waves are misaligned by only 30 experiment i2 fig 9b the magnitude of the turbulent intensity with the presence of stokes drift is already comparable to the case without stokes drift although it still gives a deeper mixed layer the reduction of turbulence in the water column results in shallower mld with increasing θ w w case i3 with θ w w 60 gives a comparable mld as with no stokes drift while further increase in θ w w gives shallower mld than case i6 without strokes drift another set of experiments were conducted using the same ocean conditions and heat flux but with a stronger wind speed of 10 m s 1 and a corresponding stokes drift velocity of 0 135 m s which also implies la t 0f 0 3 the same trend of decreasing turbulence intensity with increasing wind wave angle is observed however there is stronger turbulence in the water column for θ w w 30 when compared with the no stokes drift case this suggests that both the magnitude of the winds and waves and their misalignment angle are important for the impact of stokes drift on the level of turbulence intensity when other conditions are kept the same this difference should not be expected with carefully designed experiments when all controlling non dimensional variables are kept constant to quantify the significance of wind wave misalignment on ocean models we diagnose the scalar eddy viscosity magnitude k m obtained from the reynolds stress and mean shear following mcwilliams et al 2012 4 k m u w z u l where u w is the horizontal domain averaged total reynold stress and u l is the horizontal domain averaged lagrangian velocity mean current plus stokes drift fig 10 shows the bulk eddy viscosity for all 6 experiments all statistics presented here are averaged over one inertial period 20 3 h towards the end of the simulation averaging over alternate inertial periods or several inertial periods were tested and showed no statistical difference as suggested by previous studies mcwilliams et al 1997 when the stokes drift is aligned with the wind directions experiment i1 red solid line k m takes a convex profile shape and is significantly larger than the case without stokes drift experiment i6 black solid line when the stokes drift direction is rotated away from the wind direction the magnitude of k m is reduced although lt still significantly enhances k m with a 30 wind wave misalignment angle on average it adds no apparent turbulence to the water column for a 60 angle and even reduces k m when the misalignment angle is further increased in the along wind direction x direction the structure of the resolved reynold stress u w profiles look qualitatively similar for all cases with significant magnitude and penetration depth differences fig 10a solid lines when the wind wave angle is relatively small up to 30 the lt enhances the magnitude of the reynold stress with deeper penetration in the interior of the boundary layer compared with the shear turbulence only case experiment i6 the lt can still lead to higher magnitude of u w when θ w w reaches 60 degrees but the penetration depth becomes the same as the non stokes case further increase of θ w w leads to a significant decrease in both the magnitude and penetration depth of the resolved momentum flux since the subgrid scale sgs part of the momentum flux given in appendix is a function of the strain tensor its vertical profiles are strongly dependent on the vertical shear of the resolved velocity components which are given in fig 11 the magnitude of both the along and cross wind eulerian velocities increase sharply with θ w w become increasingly confined to the surface layer and their vertical shear significantly overwhelms the vertical shear from the stokes drift thus the maximum values of the sgs momentum flux in the along wind direction are found near surface where the strongest mean velocity shear is located and increase significantly with the increase of θ w w the penetration depth of the sgs momentum flux also increases significantly with the increase of θ w w from very close to the water surface when the wind wave misalignment is within 60 to 20 of the total boundary layer depth when θ w w reaches 120 note that when θ w w reaches 120 the sgs portion exceeds the resolved portion of the total momentum flux in the upper boundary layer thus indicating the flow regime becomes dominated more by small scale motion and that the les solutions are more sensitive to the sgs models used in the cross wind direction y direction the structure of the resolved reynold stress v w profiles also look qualitatively similar for all cases with significant magnitude and penetration depth reductions due to the increase of θ w w fig 10b however when θ w w reaches 60 the magnitude of the resolved momentum flux becomes much smaller than the case without stokes drift while the magnitude of the resolved momentum flux continues to reduce with the increase of θ w w the level of reduction is weaker compared with the along wind component while the cross wind sgs momentum fluxes appear to have their maximum values at the surface as the along wind components when θ w w is less than 90 the profiles start to show a convex shape structure when θ w w is equal to or larger than 90 the maximum of the fluxes is found below the surface and it becomes deeper with a larger magnitude as θ w w further increases this is owing to the slight curvature in the mean cross wind velocity v near the surface fig 11b that reduces the vertical shear the wind wave misalignment directly impacts both the resolved and subgrid scale energy since their balance equation includes a stokes production term van roekel et al 2012 studied the effect of misalignment on the tke budget in detail and found that the primary balance within the tke budget is between stokes shear production and the sgs terms and it undergoes significant changes as θ w w increases for small θ w w the primary balance is between the stokes shear production in the along wind direction and the sgs terms as θ w w increases the stokes shear decreases in along wind direction while increases slowly in the cross wind direction our model results are consistent with these findings and thus not shown here note that pearson 2018 showed that the use of sgs model in les simulation with stokes drift leads to an artificial tke production close to the surface when the wind wave angle is close to 90 at the equator since our simulation is conducted at mid latitude 36 1837 o n that effect is likely minimal 3 4 interaction between langmuir turbulence and deep convection in the real case simulations at station asi2 discussed in sections 3 1 and 3 2 during a 7 hour period from october 29 18 utc to october 30 1 utc we not only observed a strong reduction of tke in the mixed layer due to the inclusion of stokes drift in experiment 1 fig 4a but also noticed reduction of tke beneath the mixed layer fig 4d this reduction of tke beneath the mixed layer became stronger after we aligned the wind and waves in experiment 3 fig 4e as discussed in section 3 1 although the stokes drift is artificially aligned with the wind directions in experiment 3 its magnitude is smaller than fully developed wind seas due to young under developed wind waves and swell dominance in the wave field thus the turbulent langmuir number l a t is large 0 4 1 in experiment 3 fig 5e while the hoenikker number ho 4 b 0 u s β u 2 where b 0 is the surface buoyancy flux and β is the stokes drift current e folding depth is still less than 1 the critical value for transition from lt to convective turbulence min and noh 2004 li et al 2005 its magnitude fig 5f is much larger than typical values of o 0 01 found in idealized experiments dominated by lt li et al 2005 thus both metrics suggest a turbulence regime with combined lt and convective plumes at the asi2 research site several hours before time 0 october 29 18 utc there is an intrusion of warmer and saltier water in the upper layers fig 3 that has increased the density of the surface water and reduced the mixed layer depth with heavier water overlay on lighter water fig 12a while the unstable structure has led to active turbulent mixing to efficiently mix this dense water downward and deepen the mixed layer by time 0 the continuous intrusion of warmer and saltier water together with the strong cooling event that starts at time 0 fig 5d has significantly increased the density in the surface water and reduced the mixed layer depth to just 5 7 m although some fresher water was introduced to the system a few hours later fig 3 that has reduced the density of the surface water fig 12a another intrusion of saltier water together with strong cooling event a few hours later densifies the surface water and shallows the mixed layer again we can clearly see these heavy waters propagate down the water column in fig 12a notice that the event with lower turbulent intensity in the langmuir case experiment 1 and 3 happens beneath the mixed layer and coincide with joint events of mixed layer shallowing due to warmer and saltier water inflow and the surface cooling caused by meteorology events we compare the model results between experiment 2 and 3 in fig 13 to unveil the effect of lt during these cooling events by taking a close look at the magnitude of the vertical turbulent velocity w and the vertical velocity skewness following mcwilliams et al 1997 definition 5 γ w 3 w 2 3 2 where the angle brackets represent the horizontal domain average from time 0 to time 1 the intrusion of warmer and saltier water together with the strong cooling event that starts at time 0 fig 5d has significantly increased the density in the surface water and reduced the mixed layer depth to just 5 7 m while this dense water is mixed down the water column fresher water inflow fig 3 has created a light layer near surface and a dense layer end up sandwiched in between of two light layers fig 12a a prominent feature during this period is the strong vertical velocity w beneath the mixed layer which is associated with large negative γ values for both experiments 2 and 3 fig 13 according to sullivan et al 2007 negative values of γ are indicative of strong short lived downwelling events alternating with weaker longer lived upwelling events and can thus be used to indicate the presence of langmuir circulation or unstable convection since the w values are much weaker in the mixed layer and there is heavy water at a depth of 5 m overlay on lighter water in the water column fig 12 the large w values beneath the mixed layer have to be associated with deep convection plumes notice that the heavy water near the base of the mixed layer light orange color is thicker in experiment 3 fig 12c compared with experiment 2 fig 12b since the tke in experiment 2 is much stronger than experiment 3 in the mixed layer fig 4 it is natural to think that the enhanced tke has led to the thinner layer of heavy water in experiment 2 however enhanced tke in the mixed layer should erode the part of the heavier water above the mixed layer base not below as we observed in fig 12 thus another explanation is attempted here on the interaction between langmuir circulation and deep convection at the base of the mixed layer we observe reduced w near the base of the mixed layer and below the mixed layer depth associated with reduced magnitude in negative γ in experiment 3 indicating weaker convection plumes what happens here could be that the well organized upwelling associated with langmuir cells has weakened the downward propagation of the denser water weaker w around the base of the mixed layer in experiment 3 fig 13c and lead to a thicker dense water layer below and above lighter water at the base of the mixed layer in experiment 3 compared with experiment 2 fig 12c and b since the enhanced upwelling is counter acting on the downwelling associated with the deep convection beneath the mixed layer it reduced the overall turbulence level beneath the mixed layer 4 summary and discussions langmuir turbulence lt is believed to be one of the leading causes of turbulent mixing in the upper ocean li et al 1995 skylingstad and denbo 1995 kukulka et al 2009 2010 mcwilliams et al 1997 hamlington et al 2014 large eddy simulation les models that solve the craik leibovich equations are used to study lt yielding new insights that could not be obtained from field observations or turbulent closure models alone however these studies have been mostly conducted under idealized conditions in this study we expand our previous les modeling investigations of lt to the real ocean with complex oceanic and meteorological conditions data collected through a multi platform field campaign coupled air sea processes and electromagnetic em ducting research casper east are used for the les simulations this onr funded field study took place off the coast of north carolina in late october to early november of 2015 the study area is constantly influenced by inflows of fresher and colder water from nearby rivers and bays and warmer and saltier water along the gulf stream and experienced several cooling events and dramatic turning of wind directions due to a passing storm during the observation period ocean temperature t salinity s and directional surface gravity wave spectrum were collected together with atmospheric measurements providing a rich data set to study the effects of lt on the dynamics and structure of the oceanic mixed layer under complicated oceanic and meteorological conditions in order to account for the effect of strong local variability in t and s while restricted to periodic horizontal boundary conditions model t and s are relaxed toward glider measurements with a relaxation e folding time scale of 30 min the stokes drift profile time series were computed from the two dimensional wave spectra collected by a scripps miniature wave buoy mwb located at station asi2 and temporally evolving atmospheric forcing was provided from hourly forecasts using the coamps coupled mesoscale model during most of the simulation period lt enhances the turbulence in the water column and deepens the mixed layer being consistent with previous studies li et al 1995 kukulka et al 2009 2010 skylingstad and denbo 1995 mcwilliams et al 1997 hamlington et al 2014 however significant reduction in turbulent kinetic energy tke and turbulent intensity i u 2 v 2 w 2 3 u 2 v 2 w 2 are observed in the simulation with stokes drift compared to one without during a short period contradicting the commonly accepted concept that lt significantly enhances turbulent mixing in the water column analysis of the meteorology forcing and the tke budget have revealed that in the circumstance of swell dominated wave fields with young under developed wind seas the effect of stokes drift on reducing shear production is stronger than the stokes production generated by the lt and a reduction of total tke may be expected whether or not the stokes drift is aligned with the wind since the ocean waves are complex and fast varying with different combinations of wind seas and swells created by weather patterns that constantly vary both spatially and temporally both the wave condition studied here and the scenario that consists of very strong swells in the same direction as the fully developed wind seas studied in mcwilliams et al 2014 exist in the real ocean thus while idealized studies are good tools for us to gain more understanding of the effect of langmuir turbulence conducting real case studies are critical to reveal the full range of effect of langmuir circulation in the ocean a suite of idealized experiments is conducted to investigate the effect of wind wave misalignment angle θ w w on lt consistent reduction of turbulent intensity in the water column and shallowing of the mixed layer depth is observed with the increase of θ w w the wind wave misalignment also traps the momentum in a shallower surface layer thus producing large mean surface currents leading to a further reduction in the turbulent intensity both the magnitude of the wind and waves and their misalignment angle are found to be important for the impact of stokes drift on the level of turbulence in the water column while both resolved reynold stresses in the along and cross wind directions and the bulk eddy viscosity decrease with an increase in θ w w the subgrid scale sgs part of the momentum flux increases with the increase of θ w w this is because the sgs momentum flux is a function of the strain tensor its vertical profiles are strongly dependent on the vertical shear of the resolved velocity components which sharply increase with θ w w in the near surface layer in both along and cross wind directions the model results also suggest that the turbulence regime becomes dominated more by small scale motion with increasing θ w w and thus suggesting that the les solutions in cases with large wind wave misalignment become more sensitive to the sgs models used when stokes drift has a component in the opposite direction of the wind it creates a sink term for the tke and affect the sub grid scale turbulence behavior in the stable boundary layer in a way that is not very well understood thus we recommend caution in interpolating these results and more detailed studies are needed to gain full confidence on the sub grid model in large wind wave misaligned cases in the casper east simulations reduction of turbulence due to the presence of surface gravity waves are also found during a cooling event that coincide with the intrusion of warmer and saltier water by the gulf stream these changes of environmental conditions have led to a special dynamical structure in the water column with a layer of denser water sandwiched in between of two layers of light water a possible explanation could be that the well organized upwelling associated with langmuir cells weakens the downward propagation of the denser water and thus creates a thicker density barrier at the base of the mixed layer compared to the non lt case the enhanced upwelling due to lt has reduced the occurrence of deep convection beneath the mixed layer and consequently reduces the overall turbulence in the water column although this type of density structure in the water column is not commonly observed it demonstrates one of the complexities encountered in the real ocean resulting from nonlinear interactions between lt and dynamical processes that have been absent in previous idealized les modeling studies although many ocean models simulate temperature and salinity profiles nowadays correct representation of the dynamics is still needed to obtain accurate turbulence in the water column as demonstrated by these capser east simulations even if the model relaxes its temperature and salinity towards observations the turbulence in the water column is still very different with and without the presence of surface gravity waves since available ocean observations are very limited both spatially and temporally good representation of the turbulence in the water column is still critical for ocean models especially for the transfer of heat momentum and gas within the oceanic boundary layer better understanding of the nonlinear interaction between lt and complicated ocean dynamics and meteorological forcing is needed to correctly represent their effects on ocean

23971,three dimensional 3d obstacles on the bottom are common sites for the generation of vortices internal waves and turbulence by ocean currents turbulence resolving simulations are conducted for stratified flow past a conical hill a canonical example of 3d obstacles motivated by the use of slip boundary condition bc and drag law effectively partial slip bc in the literature on geophysical wakes we examine the sensitivity of the flow to bcs on the obstacle surface and the flat bottom four bc types are examined for a non rotating wake created by a steady current impinging on a conical obstacle with a detailed comparison being performed between two cases namely nosl no slip bc used at all solid boundaries and sl slip bc used at all solid boundaries the other two cases are as follows hybrid undertaken with slip at the flat bottom and no slip at the obstacle boundaries and case dl wherein a quadratic drag law bc is adopted on all solid boundaries the no slip bc allows the formation of a boundary layer which separates and sheds vorticity into the wake significant changes occur in the structure of the lee vortices and wake when the bc is changed for instance bottom wall friction in the no slip case suppresses unsteadiness of flow separation leading to a steady attached lee vortex in contrast when the bottom wall has a slip bc the sl and hybrid cases or has partial slip dl case unsteady separation leads to a vortex street in the near wake and the enhancement of turbulence the recirculation region is shorter and the wake recovery is substantially faster in the case of slip or partial slip bc in the lee of the obstacle turbulent kinetic energy tke for case nosl is concentrated in a shear layer between the recirculating wake and the free stream while tke is bottom intensified in the other three cases dl is the appropriate bc for high r e wakes where the boundary layer cannot be resolved the sources of lee vorticity are also examined in this study for each choice of bc the sloping sides lead to horizontal gradients of density at the obstacle which create vorticity through baroclinic torque independent of the type of bc the baroclinic torque dominates vortex stretch and tilt are also substantial an additional unstratified free slip case sl un is simulated and the wake is found to be thin without large wake vortices thus stratification is necessary for the formation of coherent lee vortices of the type seen in geophysical wakes keywords lee vortices turbulent wakes internal waves vorticity generation boundary conditions 1 introduction the role of bottom topography in ocean dynamics has received increasing attention in recent years the momentum transported by topographic internal waves acts as drag on the impinging flow and the energy converted from the flow to internal waves acts as a source for both remote and local turbulent mixing along with internal waves wakes are generated as the flow separates at three dimensional 3d steep multiscale bathymetry e g at luzon strait zheng et al 2008 pinkel et al 2012 buijsman et al 2014 separated flow and wake eddies in stratified water for example at the headlands of three tree point pawlak et al 2003 canals et al 2008 and palau mackinnon et al 2019 lead to form drag and additionally to turbulent dissipation and mixing stratification exerts significant dynamic control in these examples and in the model problem simulated here unlike the more studied configuration of island wakes in shallow well mixed water the role of wake vortices and attendant flow variability in flow past submerged topography has received less attention than internal waves motivating the present study of a canonical problem of stratified flow past a conical hill with a focus on wake dynamics with the advent of computing power and improved simulation techniques our ability to model wakes of flow past topography has advanced wakes of islands and seamounts have been simulated using ocean circulation models with early efforts by beckmann and haidvogel 1997 and coutis and middleton 2002 and more recent work by dong et al 2007 liu and chang 2018 and perfect et al 2018 flow separation and eddy formation off coastal topography has been examined for the california undercurrent molemaker et al 2015 the gulf stream gula et al 2015 and for tidally modulated currents past three tree point in the context of form drag warner and maccready 2014 notably submesoscale eddies with large vertical vorticity relative to the inertial frequency are injected into the flow furthermore abyssal ocean measurements at rough topography reveal strong boundary currents and elevated turbulent dissipation rates at bottom mixed layers polzin et al 2014 ruan et al 2017 garabato et al 2019 the increasing resolution of ocean models also points to the importance of topographic features e g enhanced tracer mixing as the antarctic circumpolar current acc passes through the drake passage mashayek et al 2017 and enhanced submesoscale vortices as the acc negotiates the kerguelen plateau in the south indian ocean rosso et al 2015 consider a current of characteristic speed u 0 in a stratified background with buoyancy frequency n and coriolis frequency f as the current flows past an obstacle of horizontal length scale d and height h a flow is established with dynamics governed by the following non dimensional parameters 1 reynolds number r e d defined as u 0 d ν where ν is the viscosity 2 topographic froude number f r h defined as u 0 n h 3 topographic rossby number r o defined as u 0 f d and 4 topographic slope h d the value of f r h is quite variable in deep water for example in the southern ocean a current with u 0 0 1 ms 1 that flows over a hill of 200 m height in backgrounds with n 1 0 2 1 0 3 s 1 has f r h 0 05 0 5 e g nikurashin and ferrari 2010 at f r h o 1 most of the fluid impinging on the obstacle is able to go over it and lee waves are generated in the regime of f r h 1 some of the upstream fluid is blocked from going over the obstacle and there are nonlinear hydraulic effects associated with blocking of flow at depths below a distance of o u 0 n from the crest baines 1995 for 3d obstacles the flow can instead go around the obstacle and its subsequent separation leads to lee vortices as found in laboratory experiments hunt and snyder 1980 vosper et al 1999 in the present work we consider a low froude number of f r h 0 2 where predominant horizontal flow is anticipated along with a relatively steep slope of h d 0 3 which accentuates flow separation since f r h is not 1 some of the oncoming fluid can go over the obstacle to generate internal waves at near equatorial locations the importance of rotation diminishes this scenario favors the generation of cyclonic and anticylonic eddies of nearly equal strength hasegawa et al 2004 while several numerical studies of ocean wakes have focused extensively on the r o 1 regime topographic wakes which belong to r o o 1 have received less attention strong currents have been observed to separate in the lee of islands kimura et al 1994 hasegawa et al 2004 chang et al 2019 and mountains chopra and hubert 1964 grubisic et al 2015 when currents encounter small obstacles say d 500 m the topographic rossby number can be as large as 10 assuming inertial frequency at 15 n our study examines a model oceanic wake problem in this regime and rotation effects are excluded in this paper so as to focus on stratification effects in the absence of rotation since our objective is to examine the flow in a model that resolves the boundary layer and the turbulence a moderate reynolds number of r e d 15 000 is chosen this simulation model has been validated and used to examine stratified flow past a sphere pal et al 2016 2017 chongsiripinyo and sarkar 2017 previous studies of atmospheric lee vortices in mountain wakes are relevant baroclinic generation namely the production of horizontal vorticity by baroclinic torque and its subsequent tilt towards the vertical appears to be the favored mechanism for lee vortices rather than the vorticity injected by boundary layer separation this mechanism was proposed by smolarkiewicz and rotunno 1988 prompted by their simulation of flow past a bell shaped hill their model which used a slip bc on all solid boundaries therefore no boundary layer exhibited an attached lee vortex when f r h was decreased below 0 5 the flow pattern was similar to that in laboratory experiments at similar f r h by hunt and snyder 1980 subsequent work e g rotunno et al 1998 and epifanio and rotunno 2005 has further developed this explanation by analysis of vorticity and potential vorticity pv balances alternate mechanisms for lee vortices in the case of slip bc have been

sufficiently below 1 but the cutoff value of f r h varies and is likely sensitive to r e d obstacle shape and freestream disturbances similar to the previous numerical studies of a cylindrical island dong et al 2007 and a conical seamount perfect et al 2018 the present work is an idealized model there are crucial differences too 1 a hill with negligible rotation influence is considered here instead of large topography with r o o 1 and 2 our numerical model is a non hydrostatic turbulence resolving les in contrast to a hydrostatic roms model with parameterized turbulent eddy viscosity the effective reynolds number ranges up to 6400 in dong et al 2007 and is approximately 2000 in perfect et al 2018 the literature review shows that stratified oceanic flows in a regime with both internal waves and some upstream blocking and additionally at high rossby numbers have received less attention in both atmospheric and oceanic applications different types of bcs have been used and there is some disagreement among studies with respect to the formation and unsteadiness of lee vortices we are thus motivated in the present study to examine the sensitivity of a non rotating wake to various bcs with parameters as described by table 2 the use of high resolution les also provides an opportunity to quantitatively study lee vortices including the wake vorticity balance in the presence of unsteady dissipative motions of turbulence the problem is formulated in section 2 where the governing equations numerical model and simulation parameters are described section 3 is a discussion of how bcs impact several aspects of the flow including separation the recirculation region and its unsteadiness wake defect velocity and wake turbulence the influence of bcs on vortex dynamics is discussed in section 4 where the role of baroclinicity in the formation of lee vortices is also assessed the paper concludes with a summary of the results and conclusions in section 5 2 problem formulation 2 1 governing equations the 3d non hydrostatic flow is modeled by the navier stokes equations under the boussinesq approximation the equations for conservation of mass momentum and density in a high rossby number r o 1 regime are represented below in tensor notation 1 u i x i 0 2 u i t u j u i x j 1 ρ 0 d p d x i g ρ ρ 0 δ i 3 τ i j x j 3 ρ t u j ρ x j χ j x j the density field is decomposed as 4 ρ ρ 0 ρ b g z ρ x y z t where ρ b g is a linear function of z leading to a constant n in the simulations the large eddy simulation les technique is employed to model the effect of unresolved scales of the flow thus τ i j and χ j include the contribution from both molecular viscosity and the subgrid scale stress the symbols used here are defined in table 1 2 2 simulated cases the setup of the problem is illustrated in fig 1 the flow is initialized with uniform velocity u u 0 0 0 which also serves as the inlet bc at solid boundaries the velocity vectors can be decomposed as u n u t 1 and u t 2 where u n is the velocity normal to the wall and u t 1 u t 2 are the wall tangential velocities the bcs are varied among cases in particular the solid boundaries are either assigned as no slip walls or slip walls 5 no slip wall s 0 u n 0 u t 1 0 u t 2 0 6 impermeable slip wall s 1 u n 0 τ n t 1 0 τ n t 2 0 in the above equations s is a parameter used to distinguish between a slip wall where s 1 and a no slip wall s 0 as shown in eq 6 the no slip bottom boundary is the physically accurate bc thus when s 0 a boundary layer bl develops upstream which grows in thickness as the flow approaches the hill the early development of the bl is visible in the velocity profile plotted at x x d 2 4 in fig 2 a resolving the gradients in the viscous bl is computationally expensive at high r e therefore models of geophysical flows often adopt a slip bc s 1 or a drag law akin to partial slip for convenience letting the bl be unresolved the dimensions of the domain are listed in table 2 for five different cases the nosl case has no slip bottom boundary s 0 everywhere and the velocity profile in the inlet plane is the blasius bl profile in this case the bl thickness δ is fixed at 0 03 h at the inlet x l x and grows to 0 1 h at the obstacle the sl and sl un cases have slip s 1 on all solid boundaries and to be consistent the inlet plane has uniform velocity u 0 rather than a bl profile note that sl un denotes the unstratified analog of the sl case fig 2 a shows the two inflow velocity profiles for the slip and no slip cases the hybrid case uses a combination of bcs the obstacle boundary is no slip while the flat bottom is a slip boundary the bottom bl is prevented from forming and interacting with the wake since s 1 on the flat bottom at the same time the choice of s 0 on the obstacle boundary allows boundary layer vorticity from the obstacle to feed into the wake bottom friction effects require consideration in the numerical modeling of geophysical wakes however when the boundary layer is resolved as is the case here the reynolds number is necessarily moderate r e d 1 0 4 and the effect of bottom friction is stronger than in geophysical flows a drag law can be used to approximate the high r e boundary layer an approach which offers the following advantages 1 a choice for local drag coefficient c d which has a lower value than c d of a laminar low r e boundary layer and is more realistic for a turbulent boundary layer and 2 it is an unsteady boundary condition unlike no slip and therefore does not overly constrain the fluid near the boundary to be quasi steady we have performed an additional simulation using a quadratic drag law case dl with c d 0 0025 applied to the flat bottom and to the obstacle boundary for details regarding the implementation readers are referred to rapaka and sarkar 2016 convective outflow bcs are employed at the outlet orlanski 1976 for scalar variables the no flux bc is imposed everywhere to keep the system adiabatic internal gravity waves are supported by the background stratification in order to prevent spurious reflections of these disturbances sponge regions are employed near the top and inlet boundaries where the relaxation terms σ x i u i x i t u i and σ x i ρ x i t ρ b g z are added to the governing equations to accomplish rayleigh damping pal et al 2017 note that for nosl the upstream domain size l x is smaller than for other cases this limits the thickness of the boundary layer bl at the obstacle to 0 1 h 2 3 numerical details the nosl case which has a shorter streamwise domain size has a mesh with 564 7 million nodes and the sl sl un dl hybrid cases have 629 14 million nodes in the nosl case the grid resolution is very fine at the boundary to resolve the large velocity gradients at the flat bottom and the obstacle boundary the grid spacing is δ x 0 013 h δ y 0 019 h and δ z 0 0049 h since the bl thickness just upstream of the obstacle is δ 0 1 h it is evident that bl gradients dominant in the vertical in this quasi laminar bl are well resolved the spatial derivatives are computed using second order central finite differences on a staggered grid for time advancement a semi implicit runge kutta crank nicholson rk3 cn formulation is used the spanwise domain extends up to 3 d on each side and periodic bcs are imposed on these lateral boundaries similar to the approach of dairay et al 2015 the elliptic pressure poisson equation takes advantage of uniform grid spacing in the spanwise direction thereby enabling fourier decomposition a 2d poisson equation is formed for each fourier mode and solved efficiently with a direct solver namely the divide and conquer strategy proposed by rossi and toivanen 1999 2 3 1 topography the bathymetry considered in all cases is a conical obstacle fig 2 b with height h of 150 m and bottom diameter d of 500 m the obstacle is generated by rotating a smooth triangle around its vertical axis the slope of the obstacle is 30 while the crest and foothill are smoothed out the flow is resolved using a cartesian staggered grid and the obstacle is modeled with an immersed boundary method the numerical implementation of the bc on the body is summarized as follows the grid points inside the body are tagged as solid points those outside the boundary are fluid points the fluid points in the vicinity of the boundary are called forcing points these are the points where the bcs are applied during the predictor step of rk3 cn fig 3 shows a schematic of the tagged points in the vicinity of the obstacle boundary for every forcing point f point b is obtained by tracing a normal to the surface passing through f subsequently the interpolation point p is obtained by backtracking b f to the cell with the nearest face intersection the velocity components at p denoted as u p are determined from its fluid neighbors by linear interpolation and the velocity components at b are assigned using eq 6 finally the velocity components at the forcing point f are determined by weighted averages of u b and u p for additional details the reader is referred to yang and balaras 2006 2 3 2 les model large eddy simulations les are conducted with effects of the unresolved fine scales represented with a subgrid scale sgs model thus the viscous stress and density flux vector in eqs 1 and 3 are computed as 7 τ i j ν ν s g s u i x j χ j κ κ s g s ρ x j here ν s g s is estimated using the dynamic eddy viscosity model of germano et al 1991 as ν s g s c s δ 2 s where s 2 s i j s i j the coefficient c s is dynamically computed lilly 1992 the customary smoothing of c s is performed in this problem with lagrangian averaging meneveau et al 1996 along particle trajectories using an exponential weighting function lagrangian averaging is effective in flows which do not have a homogeneous spatial direction to implement smoothing in all simulations the subgrid prandtl number p r s g s ν s g s κ s g s is fixed as unity the mean value reynolds average of any field variable is obtained by averaging in time after the initial transient has subsided the mean value of the parameter ϕ is denoted by ϕ and the fluctuating field becomes ϕ ϕ ϕ the turbulent kinetic energy is denoted by k u i u i 2 3 flow velocity fluid that is able to go over the obstacle generates internal waves that propagate in the stratified background for f r 1 stratification introduces a critical height z s h 1 α t f r h that determines whether fluid can travel vertically over an obstacle or is limited to horizontal motion around the topography here α t is a factor of order 1 and is dependent on the shape of the obstacle hunt and snyder 1980 above z s fluid kinetic energy is sufficient to overcome the potential energy barrier vertical motion in this region of the flow is effective at generating internal waves that can propagate in the stratified background below z s the fluid is confined vertically or blocked and is deflected sideways to eventually separate with primarily horizontal motion the instantaneous streamlines discussed in section 3 1 reveal that flow separation as well as the post separation flow changes qualitatively when the bc is changed from nosl the influence of bc type is quantified in section 3 2 where the mean velocity fields are discussed the temporal variability in the wake also depends substantially on the bc as elaborated in section 3 3 turbulence levels are quantified through the turbulent kinetic energy tke in section 3 4 3 1 streamlines fig 4 shows instantaneous streamlines in nosl and sl these streamlines originate upstream of the body and are colored with the vertical velocity w value one set of streamlines originates from a vertical line y 0 01 and x 0 6 located centrally and upstream some of the upper streamlines in this set those that originate above z s have sufficient positive red w to surmount the obstacle after which they slope downward to follow a downslope jet the subsequent oscillation of these streamlines is indicative of a lee wave streamlines that originate below z s on the vertical line are unable to surmount the obstacle and their lateral sideways deflection can be seen as they negotiate the obstacle another set of streamlines in fig 4 originates from a spanwise oriented upstream line located at z 0 066 a height below z s and x 0 6 these streamlines illustrate the downward and lateral motion of fluid that originates from the blocked region the isosurface of u 0 is plotted in silver blue and serves to demarcate the recirculation zone flow separation in nosl has a pattern that is distinct from sl although both cases exhibit upstream blocking fluid in nosl experiences viscous drag and owing to the larger reduction of flow speed separates earlier relative to sl the streamlines in sl show that the fluid is able to navigate around the obstacle curvature for a longer distance and curve inward before eventual separation consequently the separation line which is the intersection of the u 0 isosurface in silver blue with the obstacle has a smaller lateral size in sl the post separation flow is strikingly different between nosl and sl the recirculation region is significantly shorter in sl the small scale corrugations in the u 0 isosurface and the rapid changes in the direction of w along streamlines indicate that the near wake in sl has stronger turbulence than nosl fig 4 b shows that some of the streamlines adjacent to the bottom exhibit large lateral excursion around the recirculation region these excursions illustrate unsteady large amplitude lateral meanders of fluid in the wake that are prominent in sl and absent in nosl 3 2 mean velocity to investigate the influence of the bc on the flow statistics we examine the mean streamwise and vertical velocity fields shown in fig 5 initially the flow in the downstream wake is allowed to become statistically steady the equilibrium time needed to attain this state is estimated to be 70 d u 0 after t 70 d u 0 statistics are recorded and the temporal average is performed over a time span of 40 d u 0 comparison among fig 5 a d shows that the recirculation bubble in the lee of the obstacle is largest in nosl followed by dl hybrid and then sl the unblocked layer of fluid which is able to traverse the obstacle vertically generates steady lee waves with phase lines that are prominent in the vertical velocity contours of fig 5 e h the lee waves far away from the obstacle beyond x 2 5 are similar in the centerplane y 0 among the three cases however the lee wave near field is different in nosl fig 5 e relative to the other cases here the larger recirculation zone does not allow the lee waves to penetrate into a substantial portion of the near wake however in sl dl and hybrid the lee wave phase lines in fig 5 f h that are downstream of x 2 end of the recirculation region extend close to the flat bottom although the hybrid and dl cases exhibit a slightly larger recirculation zone downstream the wake in these cases is qualitatively similar to sl therefore the comparison in subsequent sections will be primarily between cases sl and nosl the lateral structure of the flow is illustrated by fig 6 which shows the variation of mean streamwise and vertical velocity on the horizontal plane located at the height z 0 5 fig 6 a b shows that independent of the bc the wake grows laterally after the recirculation zone ends owing to the shorter streamwise length of the recirculation zone the lateral growth commences earlier in sl the lateral structure of the lee waves is illustrated by the vertical velocity field shown in fig 6 c d away from the body the lee wave signature is less clear in sl for example phase lines in the region y 1 are less distinct in fig 6 d relative to fig 6 c the slip bc in sl allows significant unsteady lateral v velocity outside the mean wake which interferes with the establishment of the wave field in this region of y 1 immediately behind the body it is in nosl where the wave field is disrupted thus in nosl fig 6c the signature of the wave in the central region behind the obstacle is absent in the recirculation bubble but eventually appears beyond x 2 nosl fig 6c also shows upstream spanwise invariant stripes in the vertical velocity which are associated with an internal wave response of the developing boundary layer as it approaches the obstacle these stripes are negligible in the other cases the behavior of mean defect velocity u d where u d u 0 u x y z t depends on the bc as is qualitatively apparent from fig 6 a b to further quantify the influence of the bc the evolution of normalized u d is plotted along the horizontal line located at z 0 25 and y 0 in fig 7 the recirculation zone can be demarcated using the condition u d u 0 1 the recirculation zone for nosl is more than three times longer than in sl dl and hybrid in nosl the value of u d decreases in a monotone fashion after the recirculation zone similarly there is a decrease of u d after the recirculation zone in sl dl and hybrid however u d decreases more rapidly relative to nosl indicating that sl has fluid with higher velocity relative to nosl in the lee the reason is that higher velocity freestream fluid is brought periodically into the lee by the lateral flapping of the wake and increases the time averaged velocity it is worth noting that the signature of the lateral flapping on streamlines namely a large scale lateral meander was shown in fig 4 the rapid decrease of u d in sl lasts until x 5 the amplitude of the lateral motion decreases with increasing x and after x 5 the strength of the initial decrease of u d can no longer be maintained and the value of u d tends to increase somewhat the imprint of the steady lee waves on the defect velocity is seen as a modulation of u d with the wavelength of 2 π f r d fig 7b 3 3 velocity spectra in fig 8 the spectra of streamwise u and spanwise v velocity are plotted at a downstream location x 1 y 0 39 and z 0 166 close to the obstacle the strouhal number s t is defined as f s d u 0 where f s denotes the frequency computed from the fourier transform of the temporal flow history at the probe the probe location has been chosen such that it lies on the trajectory of the shed vortices case sl shows a broadband spectrum with a wide separation of time scales in the flow indicative of a fully turbulent flow in contrast the amplitude of the spectrum in nosl is smaller by a factor of 1 0 3 and furthermore spans a narrower range of frequencies the amplitudes of s u u and s v v are comparable in sl both s u u and s v v in sl reveal a discrete peak at s t 0 24 which corresponds to the shedding frequency of the lee vortices off the obstacle the observed s t 0 24 is close to the estimate of s t 0 264 computed from the s t r e d relationship proposed by williamson and brown 1998 for cylinder wakes there is no such periodic component in nosl at this location moving to a further downstream location we find a periodic signal in both components of horizontal velocity and a corresponding spectral peak in both sl and nosl this temporal periodicity is illustrated by fig 9 a for the v component at a downstream location x 9 y 0 and z 0 5 in nosl the spectral peak of v at this location is at s t 0 5 and corresponds to the barotropic sinuous instability of the quasi two dimensional wake lesieur 2008 the barotropic instability of wakes and jets takes the form of a sinuous mode that evolves into two staggered rows of vortices of opposite sign maslowe 1991 perret et al 2011 carpenter and smyth 2019 and under forcing also a varicose mode with two non staggered vortex rows the frequency of this instability in nosl is found to vary with height so that s t takes values between 0 4 and 0 8 however for case sl the vortex shedding frequency does not change with height 3 4 turbulent kinetic energy to quantify the influence of bcs on the wake turbulence snapshots of tke are shown in the central vertical plane y 0 in fig 10 additionally mean velocity vectors are shown at selected streamwise locations to illustrate the overall flow structure in nosl there is strong bottom shear in the recirculation region however the bottom boundary layer is quasi laminar at this moderate r e and furthermore bottom friction restricts the lateral meander of the wake that would generate turbulent fluctuations therefore in the near bottom region of 0 z 0 2 nosl exhibits small tke in the upper region a shear layer forms at the boundary of the recirculation zone with the downslope jet and lee wave to support turbulent fluctuations shown by a zone of enhanced tke fig 10a which spreads vertically with increasing x these fluctuations also trigger instability of the horizontal shear in the wake to eventually allow the spanwise oscillation fig 9 which is seen further downstream in sl the recirculation zone is small the slip bc allows near bottom lateral meanders close to the body as well as broadband fluctuations which are reflected in the high tke content of the flow in the lee of the obstacle unlike nosl a strong upper shear layer does not develop and the tke is bottom intensified 4 vortex dynamics lee vortices which are coherent patches of vertical vorticity ω z with size comparable to the lateral dimensions of the obstacle represent a noticeable pattern in geophysical wakes lee vortices are present in the simulations of stratified flow past an obstacle however boundary conditions affect the spatial organization and the temporal signature of the lee vortices as elaborated in section 4 1 apart from the organized ω z in lee wake vortices there are swirling motions with horizontal vorticity which are associated with internal waves separated shear layers with vertical shear boundary layers and also disorganized turbulence the effect of bcs on ω y is discussed in section 4 2 the mechanism underlying the formation of lee vortices is of interest boundary layer vorticity is generally thought to be the primary source of wake vorticity however in the stratified mountain wake simulated by smolarkiewicz and rotunno 1988 a slip bc was used and attached lee vortices were found the authors attributed the formation of coherent vortices to the generation of horizontal vorticity by baroclinic torque followed by tilting of horizontal vorticity to the vertical obstacle curvature can also induce vorticity into the flow and smith and smith 1995 allude to this mechanism as a possible source of lee vortices vorticity induced by this mechanism is proportional to the tangential velocity of the flow at the obstacle surface as elaborated later in section 4 3 we conduct an additional unstratified simulation sl un to ascertain if curvature alone without baroclinicity can lead to lee vortices and present its results in section 4 3 sl un has the same obstacle geometry and current speed as sl but the background is unstratified section 4 4 includes a quantitative analysis of the vorticity sources to further clarify the generation mechanism of lee wake vortices the area y z integrated value of the squared vorticity in each component is computed and the streamwise evolution is contrasted among various cases furthermore the relative magnitudes of the principal source sinks of vorticity are evaluated to directly assess the importance of baroclinic torque relative to the other sources 4 1 lee wake vortices the organization of vertical vorticity ω z in nosl is strikingly different from sl dl and hybrid cases while the latter three cases resemble each other fig 11 illustrates the difference by showing ω z contours on horizontal planes at four different heights in the wake in nosl fig 11a there is a pair of counter rotating vortices at z 0 066 close to the bottom these lee vortices are found to be steady in time and take the form of an attached recirculation bubble the presentation of these vortices resembles the lee vortex pair found near the bottom in the laboratory experiment of hunt and snyder 1980 and also in aerial observations by smith and grubisic 1993 of the wake of hawaii at the somewhat higher location of z 0 33 too there is a steady recirculation bubble however at the even higher location of z 0 66 the recirculation bubble while remaining attached displays unsteadiness at its tail end and coherent vortices appear further downstream the size of the lee vortices at a given height is proportional to the local diameter d z of the conical obstacle this large scale unsteadiness observed further downstream sets in at heights above z 0 2 through barotropic sinuous instability lesieur 2008 carpenter and smyth 2019 of the velocity profile of a quasi two dimensional wake that develops into coherent vortices in contrast the bottom slip wall in sl allows unsteady shedding of alternating opposite signed kármán vortices from the obstacle their instantaneous presentation is qualitatively different from nosl as can be seen by comparing the z 0 066 and 0 33 planes fig 11b to the corresponding planes in nosl fig 11a the shedding of kármán vortices from the body leads to lateral flapping of the wake which is manifested by the lateral meanders in the streamlines and the oscillation of the centerline lateral velocity which were described previously at z 0 93 the lee waves interfere strongly with the coherent structures in the wake thereby disturbing the vortex street to summarize lee vortices form behind the obstacle independent of the bc furthermore their lateral size at a given height is proportional to the local diameter of the obstacle the critical difference introduced by the type of bc is that the lee vortices in sl are shed off the body unsteadily to result in a kármán vortex street while in nosl there is a quasi steady attached vortex pair the results of previous sections on the mean velocity show that the behavior of dl resembles sl and hybrid fig 12 c depicts contours of ω z in the horizontal plane z 0 25 in the drag law case the corresponding ω z contours for the other bcs which are included for comparison in fig 12 demonstrate that dl hybrid and sl cases are qualitatively similar in terms of vortex dynamics 4 2 spanwise vorticity in addition to the vertically oriented lee vortices there is substantial horizontal vorticity the organization of horizontal vorticity depends on bcs as illustrated by the two orthogonal planar views of ω y in fig 13 for example the boundary layer on the flat bottom provides a significant swath of ω y seen in the horizontal plane with positive values under the current and small negative values under the weak recirculating flow in nosl a feature that is absent in sl fig 13 above the obstacle both cases exhibit ω y associated with the lee wave there is also a thin strip of ω y on the obstacle which is created by the upslope flow followed by the downstream jet this strip separates from the obstacle slightly below its apex and subsequently exhibits the wavelength of the impressed lee wave the flow behind the obstacle in sl shows a disorganized pattern with small scale patches of intense ω y fig 13 b the small scale variability is much less pronounced in nosl evidently for the conditions of this study the boundary layer on the flat bottom is able to restrict wake turbulence 4 3 unstratified wake we have seen that for all bcs considered here there are coherent wake vortices in low f r h flow past a conical obstacle and they take the form of unsteady kármán vortices shed from the body in the sl case both body curvature and baroclinicity have been advanced in the past as potential origins of the wake vorticity to exclude the effect of baroclinicity an unstratified counterpart sl un has been simulated with the slip bc vorticity can be induced by solely body curvature and is proportional to the tangential slip velocity of the flow at the obstacle leal 1989 legendre et al 2009 to demonstrate curvature induced vorticity consider free slip flow past a circular shear free cylinder of radius a in polar coordinates r θ since u r 0 and τ r θ 0 at r a it follows that u θ r u θ a and ω z u θ r u θ r r a 2 u θ a here u θ represents the surface tangential velocity as elaborated below the unstratified counterpart is qualitatively different from the stratified cases in particular although curvature alone does give rise to vorticity lee vortices with size comparable to the body do not form in the wake fig 14 a shows that for case sl un flow separation in the vertical centerplane y 0 occurs at x 0 35 and z 0 3 this is in contrast to the near apex separation in the corresponding stratified case sl left column of fig 5 fig 14 b shows that separation is also delayed in the horizontal z 0 066 plane where it occurs close to the rear stagnation point the flow remains attached to the sloping and curved geometry in sl un for a long distance before separation because of the following reasons a absence of viscous loss of momentum at the boundary and b lack of a lee wave and its imposition of an adverse pressure gradient on the boundary flow it is worth noting that in previous work on unstratified flow past a 3d obstacle with a no slip bc e g garcia villalba et al 2009 flow separation at the obstacle occurs substantially upstream relative to sl un and there is a large recirculation zone followed by a turbulent wake the recirculating flow at the junction of the bottom and central lee of the obstacle generates a narrow wake that develops a sinuous instability in the horizontal plane fig 14 b and c show the streamwise and spanwise velocity respectively in a horizontal plane z 0 066 here this narrow region of attached low velocity fluid in the lee can be noticed along with the subsequent sinuous instability the three components of vorticity are shown in fig 14 d f on a horizontal plane the location of the plane at z 0 066 is sufficiently below the apex so as to include the separated flow in the lee of the obstacle there is vertical vorticity at the body in fig 14 d owing to its curvature in the horizontal plane however the wake behind the body is narrow and does not exhibit the large lee vortices seen in the stratified cases this observation confirms that curvature alone without baroclinicity is insufficient for the emergence of large lee wake vortices that have been observed in geophysical flows spanwise vorticity ω y is predominantly positive adjacent to the obstacle owing to the curvature of the hill in the vertical plane the narrow wake has both spanwise fig 14 e and streamwise fig 14 f vorticity 4 4 sources of vorticity the vorticity transport equation obtained by employing the curl operator on eq 2 is as follows 8 ω i t u j ω i x j ω j u i x j e i j 3 b x j ν 2 ω i x j 2 e i k m x k x j ν s g s u m x j on the right hand side r h s of eq 8 the first term represents vortex stretching tilting and the second term is the baroclinic torque the third and fourth terms are molecular diffusion and the modeled subgrid diffusion respectively both are lumped together into a single diffusion term in the results in the case of an unstratified background boundary layer vorticity diffuses from the obstacle into the flow and is subsequently reoriented and intensified by the vortex stretching tilting term a stratified background provides an additional vorticity source namely the baroclinic torque associated with horizontal density gradients fig 15 is an illustration of the horizontal density contrast on z 0 5 located below the dividing streamline the complex three dimensional flow in the vicinity of the obstacle is responsible for the observed density contrast consider nosl fig 15 a there is colder denser fluid purple immediately upstream of the body on the horizontal plane z 0 5 visualization of the streamlines in the vicinity of z 0 5 shows an upward rise in front of the hill which brings heavier fluid purple from below as the fluid negotiates the hill the streamlines dip downward bringing lighter fluid orange at the sides of hill to the plane z 0 5 in nosl there is an extensive recirculation zone behind the hill which tends to inhibit the lighter fluid from reaching z 0 5 in the lee therefore the patch of light fluid orange does not extend from the sides to behind the hill moving to sl we find that the upstream density contrast is weaker the reason is the absence of a developing upstream boundary layer which in nosl displaces the streamlines and amplifies the upward transport of colder fluid in sl too streamlines dip down as the fluid proceeds past the curved sides of the hill the larger amplitude of vertical and lateral motions behind the obstacle in sl leads to patches of light fluid in the lee fig 15 b which are larger than in nosl consequently the spanwise gradient b y is larger in sl and so is its contribution to baroclinic torque this is the reason why as shown later in the top row of fig 16 ω x behind the obstacle is larger in sl relative to nosl fig 16 shows the streamwise evolution of y z plane integrated values of enstrophy components ω x 2 ω y 2 and ω z 2 in fig 16 1a c vortex stretching in fig 16 2a c vortex tilting in fig 16 3a c diffusion term includes viscous diffusion and the contribution from eddy diffusivity in fig 16 4a c and baroclinic torque in fig 16 5a b in row 3 of fig 16 the vortex tilting term t x t y t z is shown for each vorticity component equation for example t z denotes the vortex tilting term in the ω z equation computed as ω x w x ω y w y similarly in row 4 of fig 16 the diffusion term d x d y d z is shown for each vorticity component equation the absolute value of each term in the vorticity equation is taken before computing the area integral this allows estimation of their relative importance the sign does not matter for this analysis in sl un the enstrophy components are limited to the obstacle with negligible values in the lee fluid can flow over the obstacle since stratification which diverts oncoming fluid sideways around the obstacle is absent hence the spanwise vorticity ω y is much larger than ω z the component ω x is generated by tilting of ω y and ω z owing to viscous dissipation the magnitude of each vorticity component decreases eventually the sl case is strikingly different from sl unalthough the same boundary conditions are in play each vorticity component increases in magnitude from its upstream zero value as the fluid flows past the obstacle fig 16 1a shows that there is significant enstrophy in both horizontal components not just ω y baroclinic torque absent in sl un is a source of both horizontal components and as shown by fig 16 5a it exceeds other sources of vorticity note that the range of the vertical axis is larger for row 5 baroclinic torque relative to the rows showing the other sources the vortex tilting term t z and vortex stretching term ω z w z in rows 3 and 2 of fig 16 a respectively are also substantial thus the simulations demonstrate that baroclinic torque produces horizontal vorticity which is tilted and stretched to give ω z in accord with the lee vortex mechanism proposed by smolarkiewicz and rotunno 1988 vortex tilting reduces in magnitude with increasing downstream distance which lowers the magnitude of ω z relative to the other components as shown in fig 16 1a furthermore the vortex tilt stretch terms are isotropic with no directional preference for any particular component suggesting that these terms are operative at smaller scales of motion baroclinic torque generated by density anomalies in the horizontal is also dominant in nosl shown in fig 16 5b however unlike sl the magnitude of ω y far exceeds the other components as seen in fig 16 1b the reason is that the bottom boundary layer which injects spanwise vorticity into the flow persists over the entire streamwise extent while the wake vorticity which is the primary source of the other vorticity components is dissipated by viscosity 5 summary and discussion both no slip and slip bcs have been employed in past studies of stratified flow past an isolated obstacle no slip is the physically correct bc however when the computational grid is too coarse to resolve the physical boundary layer application of the no slip bc results in an incorrect numerical boundary layer as an alternative geophysical wakes at high reynolds number have been simulated with a slip bc or by the imposition of a drag law which can be viewed as a partial slip boundary condition with the goal of clarifying the role of bc type we conduct simulations with no slip nosl and slip sl bcs of flow past a conical obstacle height h and bottom diameter d in a uniformly stratified background the selected problem has topographic froude number of f r h u 0 n h 0 2 and the reynolds number of r e d u 0 d ν 15 000 is moderate so that les with high resolution of the boundary layer and wake turbulence is possible two additional cases are also simulated a hybrid hybrid case with no slip on the obstacle and slip at the flat bottom and a drag law case dl wherein a quadratic drag law is imposed on the boundaries another important goal is to assess the role of baroclinicity in the observed vortex dynamics the stratified flow at f r h 0 2 exhibits flow blocking upstream of the obstacle streamlines that are diverted to go around rather than over the obstacle an accelerated downslope jet flow separation followed by recirculation a lee wave and wake vortices with organized ω z in the lee many of these flow features are substantially altered by the type of bc notably the lee vortices in nosl take the form of an attached counter rotating vortex pair with little unsteadiness in most of the recirculation region behind the body while in sl dl and hybrid counter rotating vortices are shed off the body to form a kármán vortex street sl dl and hybrid exhibit lateral flapping of the wake which periodically transports fluid with higher streamwise momentum to the centerline and consequently the mean value of centerline defect velocity decreases substantially faster in the near wake relative to nosl at the selected r e d 15 000 bottom friction evidently exerts a strong constraint on the wake that reduces unsteadiness near the body in nosl it is only further downstream x d of this location increases with increasing depth that the wake develops a sinuous barotropic instability the lee wake vortices show vertical variability in size independent of the bc their horizontal size is proportional to the local diameter d z of the conical obstacle the frequency of the vortex shedding that occurs in sl dl and hybrid does not vary with vertical location in the simulated cases spectra of streamwise u and lateral velocity v in the near wake region of sl show discrete peaks at the vortex shedding mode quantified as s t f s d u 0 24 although there is no discrete peak in the near wake region of nosl farther downstream there is a peak in the v spectrum at s t f s d u 0 5 which is visually apparent as a sinuous instability of the wake in the horizontal plane the boundary layers on the flat and sloping bottom are resolved in nosl therefore a laboratory experiment conducted with the present obstacle geometry and r e d 15 000 and f r h 0 2 would be expected to match the results of nosl and not sl dl or hybrid indeed for similar parameters of f r h 0 2 and r e d 13 700 hunt and snyder 1980 report a quasi steady recirculation zone containing an attached counter rotating vortex pair with some irregular unsteadiness in the wake at the moderate r e of the present simulations the boundary layer is laminar and it imposes a wall shear τ w that is steady in time and has a drag coefficient of 0 02 geophysical flows are at high r e with a turbulent boundary layer and a lower c d and a drag law bc is often used to represent the boundary layer the dl case in our study is undertaken with c d 0 0025 and gives results similar to sl and hybrid at high r e of geophysical wakes nosl is inappropriate because the viscous sublayer cannot be resolved and therefore a bc such as dl is appropriate boundary layer vorticity curvature of the body and baroclinicity have been advanced as potential generators of the lee wake vortices an unstratified simulation sl un is conducted to exclude baroclinicity from the generators of vorticity in sl un the flow remains attached over a much larger region the wake that emerges is narrow and large organized lee vortices are absent unstratified simulations with no slip bc have not been conducted here since there are prior laboratory experiments and simulations with the no slip bc of the unstratified configuration the prior studies show vortical structures different from the present lee vortices a standing horseshoe vortex and periodic shedding of hairpin vortices at low r e d acarlar and smith 1987 which changes to intermittent shedding of vortex patches at high r e d garcia villalba et al 2009 therefore we conclude that independent of the choice of bc unstratified flow does not demonstrate lee wake vortices of the type observed in geophysical wakes or in stratified flow laboratory models of said wakes all components of the vorticity are prevalent in the flow as shown by the streamwise evolution of the squared magnitude enstrophy of each vorticity component owing to bl vorticity the spanwise vorticity ω y dominates the other two components upstream and downstream of the hill in the no slip case however the increase in vorticity at the obstacle is similar among the different bcs instantaneous streamlines show opposite signed vertical motion in the aft and lee as the fluid moves past the obstacle leading to the horizontal density gradients which are necessary for the baroclinic torque to be operative in the vorticity balance sources in the equation for each vorticity component are quantified and it is found that the baroclinic torque operative only in the balances for horizontal vorticity components is dominant independent of the bc type vortex stretch and tilt are also substantial the simulation result namely that horizontal vorticity is produced by the baroclinic torque and tilted into the vertical supports the lee vortex mechanism proposed by smolarkiewicz and rotunno 1988 turbulence is quantified through the tke the lateral meanders of the wake in sl lead to high tke in the wake in nosl there is a zone of tke that originates in the vertical shear layer between the fluid in the recirculation zone and the flow above associated with the lee wave

23971,three dimensional 3d obstacles on the bottom are common sites for the generation of vortices internal waves and turbulence by ocean currents turbulence resolving simulations are conducted for stratified flow past a conical hill a canonical example of 3d obstacles motivated by the use of slip boundary condition bc and drag law effectively partial slip bc in the literature on geophysical wakes we examine the sensitivity of the flow to bcs on the obstacle surface and the flat bottom four bc types are examined for a non rotating wake created by a steady current impinging on a conical obstacle with a detailed comparison being performed between two cases namely nosl no slip bc used at all solid boundaries and sl slip bc used at all solid boundaries the other two cases are as follows hybrid undertaken with slip at the flat bottom and no slip at the obstacle boundaries and case dl wherein a quadratic drag law bc is adopted on all solid boundaries the no slip bc allows the formation of a boundary layer which separates and sheds vorticity into the wake significant changes occur in the structure of the lee vortices and wake when the bc is changed for instance bottom wall friction in the no slip case suppresses unsteadiness of flow separation leading to a steady attached lee vortex in contrast when the bottom wall has a slip bc the sl and hybrid cases or has partial slip dl case unsteady separation leads to a vortex street in the near wake and the enhancement of turbulence the recirculation region is shorter and the wake recovery is substantially faster in the case of slip or partial slip bc in the lee of the obstacle turbulent kinetic energy tke for case nosl is concentrated in a shear layer between the recirculating wake and the free stream while tke is bottom intensified in the other three cases dl is the appropriate bc for high r e wakes where the boundary layer cannot be resolved the sources of lee vorticity are also examined in this study for each choice of bc the sloping sides lead to horizontal gradients of density at the obstacle which create vorticity through baroclinic torque independent of the type of bc the baroclinic torque dominates vortex stretch and tilt are also substantial an additional unstratified free slip case sl un is simulated and the wake is found to be thin without large wake vortices thus stratification is necessary for the formation of coherent lee vortices of the type seen in geophysical wakes keywords lee vortices turbulent wakes internal waves vorticity generation boundary conditions 1 introduction the role of bottom topography in ocean dynamics has received increasing attention in recent years the momentum transported by topographic internal waves acts as drag on the impinging flow and the energy converted from the flow to internal waves acts as a source for both remote and local turbulent mixing along with internal waves wakes are generated as the flow separates at three dimensional 3d steep multiscale bathymetry e g at luzon strait zheng et al 2008 pinkel et al 2012 buijsman et al 2014 separated flow and wake eddies in stratified water for example at the headlands of three tree point pawlak et al 2003 canals et al 2008 and palau mackinnon et al 2019 lead to form drag and additionally to turbulent dissipation and mixing stratification exerts significant dynamic control in these examples and in the model problem simulated here unlike the more studied configuration of island wakes in shallow well mixed water the role of wake vortices and attendant flow variability in flow past submerged topography has received less attention than internal waves motivating the present study of a canonical problem of stratified flow past a conical hill with a focus on wake dynamics with the advent of computing power and improved simulation techniques our ability to model wakes of flow past topography has advanced wakes of islands and seamounts have been simulated using ocean circulation models with early efforts by beckmann and haidvogel 1997 and coutis and middleton 2002 and more recent work by dong et al 2007 liu and chang 2018 and perfect et al 2018 flow separation and eddy formation off coastal topography has been examined for the california undercurrent molemaker et al 2015 the gulf stream gula et al 2015 and for tidally modulated currents past three tree point in the context of form drag warner and maccready 2014 notably submesoscale eddies with large vertical vorticity relative to the inertial frequency are injected into the flow furthermore abyssal ocean measurements at rough topography reveal strong boundary currents and elevated turbulent dissipation rates at bottom mixed layers polzin et al 2014 ruan et al 2017 garabato et al 2019 the increasing resolution of ocean models also points to the importance of topographic features e g enhanced tracer mixing as the antarctic circumpolar current acc passes through the drake passage mashayek et al 2017 and enhanced submesoscale vortices as the acc negotiates the kerguelen plateau in the south indian ocean rosso et al 2015 consider a current of characteristic speed u 0 in a stratified background with buoyancy frequency n and coriolis frequency f as the current flows past an obstacle of horizontal length scale d and height h a flow is established with dynamics governed by the following non dimensional parameters 1 reynolds number r e d defined as u 0 d ν where ν is the viscosity 2 topographic froude number f r h defined as u 0 n h 3 topographic rossby number r o defined as u 0 f d and 4 topographic slope h d the value of f r h is quite variable in deep water for example in the southern ocean a current with u 0 0 1 ms 1 that flows over a hill of 200 m height in backgrounds with n 1 0 2 1 0 3 s 1 has f r h 0 05 0 5 e g nikurashin and ferrari 2010 at f r h o 1 most of the fluid impinging on the obstacle is able to go over it and lee waves are generated in the regime of f r h 1 some of the upstream fluid is blocked from going over the obstacle and there are nonlinear hydraulic effects associated with blocking of flow at depths below a distance of o u 0 n from the crest baines 1995 for 3d obstacles the flow can instead go around the obstacle and its subsequent separation leads to lee vortices as found in laboratory experiments hunt and snyder 1980 vosper et al 1999 in the present work we consider a low froude number of f r h 0 2 where predominant horizontal flow is anticipated along with a relatively steep slope of h d 0 3 which accentuates flow separation since f r h is not 1 some of the oncoming fluid can go over the obstacle to generate internal waves at near equatorial locations the importance of rotation diminishes this scenario favors the generation of cyclonic and anticylonic eddies of nearly equal strength hasegawa et al 2004 while several numerical studies of ocean wakes have focused extensively on the r o 1 regime topographic wakes which belong to r o o 1 have received less attention strong currents have been observed to separate in the lee of islands kimura et al 1994 hasegawa et al 2004 chang et al 2019 and mountains chopra and hubert 1964 grubisic et al 2015 when currents encounter small obstacles say d 500 m the topographic rossby number can be as large as 10 assuming inertial frequency at 15 n our study examines a model oceanic wake problem in this regime and rotation effects are excluded in this paper so as to focus on stratification effects in the absence of rotation since our objective is to examine the flow in a model that resolves the boundary layer and the turbulence a moderate reynolds number of r e d 15 000 is chosen this simulation model has been validated and used to examine stratified flow past a sphere pal et al 2016 2017 chongsiripinyo and sarkar 2017 previous studies of atmospheric lee vortices in mountain wakes are relevant baroclinic generation namely the production of horizontal vorticity by baroclinic torque and its subsequent tilt towards the vertical appears to be the favored mechanism for lee vortices rather than the vorticity injected by boundary layer separation this mechanism was proposed by smolarkiewicz and rotunno 1988 prompted by their simulation of flow past a bell shaped hill their model which used a slip bc on all solid boundaries therefore no boundary layer exhibited an attached lee vortex when f r h was decreased below 0 5 the flow pattern was similar to that in laboratory experiments at similar f r h by hunt and snyder 1980 subsequent work e g rotunno et al 1998 and epifanio and rotunno 2005 has further developed this explanation by analysis of vorticity and potential vorticity pv balances alternate mechanisms for lee vortices in the case of slip bc have been proposed e g streamline curvature of the boundary flow smith 1989 and dissipative production of pv schar and durran 1996 no slip bc has been employed by ding and street 2002 and their f r h 0 2 simulation conducted at r e d 730 exhibits a steady attached vortex pair in the lee with little turbulence unlike the quasi steady lee vortex found in several numerical models of the atmospheric hill wake schar and durran 1996 and vosper 2000 report an unsteady vortex street laboratory experiments of stratified flow past obstacles hunt and snyder 1980 vosper et al 1999 report lee vortices at f r h sufficiently below 1 but the cutoff value of f r h varies and is likely sensitive to r e d obstacle shape and freestream disturbances similar to the previous numerical studies of a cylindrical island dong et al 2007 and a conical seamount perfect et al 2018 the present work is an idealized model there are crucial differences too 1 a hill with negligible rotation influence is considered here instead of large topography with r o o 1 and 2 our numerical model is a non hydrostatic turbulence resolving les in contrast to a hydrostatic roms model with parameterized turbulent eddy viscosity the effective reynolds number ranges up to 6400 in dong et al 2007 and is approximately 2000 in perfect et al 2018 the literature review shows that stratified oceanic flows in a regime with both internal waves and some upstream blocking and additionally at high rossby numbers have received less attention in both atmospheric and oceanic applications different types of bcs have been used and there is some disagreement among studies with respect to the formation and unsteadiness of lee vortices we are thus motivated in the present study to examine the sensitivity of a non rotating wake to various bcs with parameters as described by table 2 the use of high resolution les also provides an opportunity to quantitatively study lee vortices including the wake vorticity balance in the presence of unsteady dissipative motions of turbulence the problem is formulated in section 2 where the governing equations numerical model and simulation parameters are described section 3 is a discussion of how bcs impact several aspects of the flow including separation the recirculation region and its unsteadiness wake defect velocity and wake turbulence the influence of bcs on vortex dynamics is discussed in section 4 where the role of baroclinicity in the formation of lee vortices is also assessed the paper concludes with a summary of the results and conclusions in section 5 2 problem formulation 2 1 governing equations the 3d non hydrostatic flow is modeled by the navier stokes equations under the boussinesq approximation the equations for conservation of mass momentum and density in a high rossby number r o 1 regime are represented below in tensor notation 1 u i x i 0 2 u i t u j u i x j 1 ρ 0 d p d x i g ρ ρ 0 δ i 3 τ i j x j 3 ρ t u j ρ x j χ j x j the density field is decomposed as 4 ρ ρ 0 ρ b g z ρ x y z t where ρ b g is a linear function of z leading to a constant n in the simulations the large eddy simulation les technique is employed to model the effect of unresolved scales of the flow thus τ i j and χ j include the contribution from both molecular viscosity and the subgrid scale stress the symbols used here are defined in table 1 2 2 simulated cases the setup of the problem is illustrated in fig 1 the flow is initialized with uniform velocity u u 0 0 0 which also serves as the inlet bc at solid boundaries the velocity vectors can be decomposed as u n u t 1 and u t 2 where u n is the velocity normal to the wall and u t 1 u t 2 are the wall tangential velocities the bcs are varied among cases in particular the solid boundaries are either assigned as no slip walls or slip walls 5 no slip wall s 0 u n 0 u t 1 0 u t 2 0 6 impermeable slip wall s 1 u n 0 τ n t 1 0 τ n t 2 0 in the above equations s is a parameter used to distinguish between a slip wall where s 1 and a no slip wall s 0 as shown in eq 6 the no slip bottom boundary is the physically accurate bc thus when s 0 a boundary layer bl develops upstream which grows in thickness as the flow approaches the hill the early development of the bl is visible in the velocity profile plotted at x x d 2 4 in fig 2 a resolving the gradients in the viscous bl is computationally expensive at high r e therefore models of geophysical flows often adopt a slip bc s 1 or a drag law akin to partial slip for convenience letting the bl be unresolved the dimensions of the domain are listed in table 2 for five different cases the nosl case has no slip bottom boundary s 0 everywhere and the velocity profile in the inlet plane is the blasius bl profile in this case the bl thickness δ is fixed at 0 03 h at the inlet x l x and grows to 0 1 h at the obstacle the sl and sl un cases have slip s 1 on all solid boundaries and to be consistent the inlet plane has uniform velocity u 0 rather than a bl profile note that sl un denotes the unstratified analog of the sl case fig 2 a shows the two inflow velocity profiles for the slip and no slip cases the hybrid case uses a combination of bcs the obstacle boundary is no slip while the flat bottom is a slip boundary the bottom bl is prevented from forming and interacting with the wake since s 1 on the flat bottom at the same time the choice of s 0 on the obstacle boundary allows boundary layer vorticity from the obstacle to feed into the wake bottom friction effects require consideration in the numerical modeling of geophysical wakes however when the boundary layer is resolved as is the case here the reynolds number is necessarily moderate r e d 1 0 4 and the effect of bottom friction is stronger than in geophysical flows a drag law can be used to approximate the high r e boundary layer an approach which offers the following advantages 1 a choice for local drag coefficient c d which has a lower value than c d of a laminar low r e boundary layer and is more realistic for a turbulent boundary layer and 2 it is an unsteady boundary condition unlike no slip and therefore does not overly constrain the fluid near the boundary to be quasi steady we have performed an additional simulation using a quadratic drag law case dl with c d 0 0025 applied to the flat bottom and to the obstacle boundary for details regarding the implementation readers are referred to rapaka and sarkar 2016 convective outflow bcs are employed at the outlet orlanski 1976 for scalar variables the no flux bc is imposed everywhere to keep the system adiabatic internal gravity waves are supported by the background stratification in order to prevent spurious reflections of these disturbances sponge regions are employed near the top and inlet boundaries where the relaxation terms σ x i u i x i t u i and σ x i ρ x i t ρ b g z are added to the governing equations to accomplish rayleigh damping pal et al 2017 note that for nosl the upstream domain size l x is smaller than for other cases this limits the thickness of the boundary layer bl at the obstacle to 0 1 h 2 3 numerical details the nosl case which has a shorter streamwise domain size has a mesh with 564 7 million nodes and the sl sl un dl hybrid cases have 629 14 million nodes in the nosl case the grid resolution is very fine at the boundary to resolve the large velocity gradients at the flat bottom and the obstacle boundary the grid spacing is δ x 0 013 h δ y 0 019 h and δ z 0 0049 h since the bl thickness just upstream of the obstacle is δ 0 1 h it is evident that bl gradients dominant in the vertical in this quasi laminar bl are well resolved the spatial derivatives are computed using second order central finite differences on a staggered grid for time advancement a semi implicit runge kutta crank nicholson rk3 cn formulation is used the spanwise domain extends up to 3 d on each side and periodic bcs are imposed on these lateral boundaries similar to the approach of dairay et al 2015 the elliptic pressure poisson equation takes advantage of uniform grid spacing in the spanwise direction thereby enabling fourier decomposition a 2d poisson equation is formed for each fourier mode and solved efficiently with a direct solver namely the divide and conquer strategy proposed by rossi and toivanen 1999 2 3 1 topography the bathymetry considered in all cases is a conical obstacle fig 2 b with height h of 150 m and bottom diameter d of 500 m the obstacle is generated by rotating a smooth triangle around its vertical axis the slope of the obstacle is 30 while the crest and foothill are smoothed out the flow is resolved using a cartesian staggered grid and the obstacle is modeled with an immersed boundary method the numerical implementation of the bc on the body is summarized as follows the grid points inside the body are tagged as solid points those outside the boundary are fluid points the fluid points in the vicinity of the boundary are called forcing points these are the points where the bcs are applied during the predictor step of rk3 cn fig 3 shows a schematic of the tagged points in the vicinity of the obstacle boundary for every forcing point f point b is obtained by tracing a normal to the surface passing through f subsequently the interpolation point p is obtained by backtracking b f to the cell with the nearest face intersection the velocity components at p denoted as u p are determined from its fluid neighbors by linear interpolation and the velocity components at b are assigned using eq 6 finally the velocity components at the forcing point f are determined by weighted averages of u b and u p for additional details the reader is referred to yang and balaras 2006 2 3 2 les model large eddy simulations les are conducted with effects of the unresolved fine scales represented with a subgrid scale sgs model thus the viscous stress and density flux vector in eqs 1 and 3 are computed as 7 τ i j ν ν s g s u i x j χ j κ κ s g s ρ x j here ν s g s is estimated using the dynamic eddy viscosity model of germano et al 1991 as ν s g s c s δ 2 s where s 2 s i j s i j the coefficient c s is dynamically computed lilly 1992 the customary smoothing of c s is performed in this problem with lagrangian averaging meneveau et al 1996 along particle trajectories using an exponential weighting function lagrangian averaging is effective in flows which do not have a homogeneous spatial direction to implement smoothing in all simulations the subgrid prandtl number p r s g s ν s g s κ s g s is fixed as unity the mean value reynolds average of any field variable is obtained by averaging in time after the initial transient has subsided the mean value of the parameter ϕ is denoted by ϕ and the fluctuating field becomes ϕ ϕ ϕ the turbulent kinetic energy is denoted by k u i u i 2 3 flow velocity fluid that is able to go over the obstacle generates internal waves that propagate in the stratified background for f r 1 stratification introduces a critical height z s h 1 α t f r h that determines whether fluid can travel vertically over an obstacle or is limited to horizontal motion around the topography here α t is a factor of order 1 and is dependent on the shape of the obstacle hunt and snyder 1980 above z s fluid kinetic energy is sufficient to overcome the potential energy barrier vertical motion in this region of the flow is effective at generating internal waves that can propagate in the stratified background below z s the fluid is confined vertically or blocked and is deflected sideways to eventually separate with primarily horizontal motion the instantaneous streamlines discussed in section 3 1 reveal that flow separation as well as the post separation flow changes qualitatively when the bc is changed from nosl the influence of bc type is quantified in section 3 2 where the mean velocity fields are discussed the temporal variability in the wake also depends substantially on the bc as elaborated in section 3 3 turbulence levels are quantified through the turbulent kinetic energy tke in section 3 4 3 1 streamlines fig 4 shows instantaneous streamlines in nosl and sl these streamlines originate upstream of the body and are colored with the vertical velocity w value one set of streamlines originates from a vertical line y 0 01 and x 0 6 located centrally and upstream some of the upper streamlines in this set those that originate above z s have sufficient positive red w to surmount the obstacle after which they slope downward to follow a downslope jet the subsequent oscillation of these streamlines is indicative of a lee wave streamlines that originate below z s on the vertical line are unable to surmount the obstacle and their lateral sideways deflection can be seen as they negotiate the obstacle another set of streamlines in fig 4 originates from a spanwise oriented upstream line located at z 0 066 a height below z s and x 0 6 these streamlines illustrate the downward and lateral motion of fluid that originates from the blocked region the isosurface of u 0 is plotted in silver blue and serves to demarcate the recirculation zone flow separation in nosl has a pattern that is distinct from sl although both cases exhibit upstream blocking fluid in nosl experiences viscous drag and owing to the larger reduction of flow speed separates earlier relative to sl the streamlines in sl show that the fluid is able to navigate around the obstacle curvature for a longer distance and curve inward before eventual separation consequently the separation line which is the intersection of the u 0 isosurface in silver blue with the obstacle has a smaller lateral size in sl the post separation flow is strikingly different between nosl and sl the recirculation region is significantly shorter in sl the small scale corrugations in the u 0 isosurface and the rapid changes in the direction of w along streamlines indicate that the near wake in sl has stronger turbulence than nosl fig 4 b shows that some of the streamlines adjacent to the bottom exhibit large lateral excursion around the recirculation region these excursions illustrate unsteady large amplitude lateral meanders of fluid in the wake that are prominent in sl and absent in nosl 3 2 mean velocity to investigate the influence of the bc on the flow statistics we examine the mean streamwise and vertical velocity fields shown in fig 5 initially the flow in the downstream wake is allowed to become statistically steady the equilibrium time needed to attain this state is estimated to be 70 d u 0 after t 70 d u 0 statistics are recorded and the temporal average is performed over a time span of 40 d u 0 comparison among fig 5 a d shows that the recirculation bubble in the lee of the obstacle is largest in nosl followed by dl hybrid and then sl the unblocked layer of fluid which is able to traverse the obstacle vertically generates steady lee waves with phase lines that are prominent in the vertical velocity contours of fig 5 e h the lee waves far away from the obstacle beyond x 2 5 are similar in the centerplane y 0 among the three cases however the lee wave near field is different in nosl fig 5 e relative to the other cases here the larger recirculation zone does not allow the lee waves to penetrate into a substantial portion of the near wake however in sl dl and hybrid the lee wave phase lines in fig 5 f h that are downstream of x 2 end of the recirculation region extend close to the flat bottom although the hybrid and dl cases exhibit a slightly larger recirculation zone downstream the wake in these cases is qualitatively similar to sl therefore the comparison in subsequent sections will be primarily between cases sl and nosl the lateral structure of the flow is illustrated by fig 6 which shows the variation of mean streamwise and vertical velocity on the horizontal plane located at the height z 0 5 fig 6 a b shows that independent of the bc the wake grows laterally after the recirculation zone ends owing to the shorter streamwise length of the recirculation zone the lateral growth commences earlier in sl the lateral structure of the lee waves is illustrated by the vertical velocity field shown in fig 6 c d away from the body the lee wave signature is less clear in sl for example phase lines in the region y 1 are less distinct in fig 6 d relative to fig 6 c the slip bc in sl allows significant unsteady lateral v velocity outside the mean wake which interferes with the establishment of the wave field in this region of y 1 immediately behind the body it is in nosl where the wave field is disrupted thus in nosl fig 6c the signature of the wave in the central region behind the obstacle is absent in the recirculation bubble but eventually appears beyond x 2 nosl fig 6c also shows upstream spanwise invariant stripes in the vertical velocity which are associated with an internal wave response of the developing boundary layer as it approaches the obstacle these stripes are negligible in the other cases the behavior of mean defect velocity u d where u d u 0 u x y z t depends on the bc as is qualitatively apparent from fig 6 a b to further quantify the influence of the bc the evolution of normalized u d is plotted along the horizontal line located at z 0 25 and y 0 in fig 7 the recirculation zone can be demarcated using the condition u d u 0 1 the recirculation zone for nosl is more than three times longer than in sl dl and hybrid in nosl the value of u d decreases in a monotone fashion after the recirculation zone similarly there is a decrease of u d after the recirculation zone in sl dl and hybrid however u d decreases more rapidly relative to nosl indicating that sl has fluid with higher velocity relative to nosl in the lee the reason is that higher velocity freestream fluid is brought periodically into the lee by the lateral flapping of the wake and increases the time averaged velocity it is worth noting that the signature of the lateral flapping on streamlines namely a large scale lateral meander was shown in fig 4 the rapid decrease of u d in sl lasts until x 5 the amplitude of the lateral motion decreases with increasing x and after x 5 the strength of the initial decrease of u d can no longer be maintained and the value of u d tends to increase somewhat the imprint of the steady lee waves on the defect velocity is seen as a modulation of u d with the wavelength of 2 π f r d fig 7b 3 3 velocity spectra in fig 8 the spectra of streamwise u and spanwise v velocity are plotted at a downstream location x 1 y 0 39 and z 0 166 close to the obstacle the strouhal number s t is defined as f s d u 0 where f s denotes the frequency computed from the fourier transform of the temporal flow history at the probe the probe location has been chosen such that it lies on the trajectory of the shed vortices case sl shows a broadband spectrum with a wide separation of time scales in the flow indicative of a fully turbulent flow in contrast the amplitude of the spectrum in nosl is smaller by a factor of 1 0 3 and furthermore spans a narrower range of frequencies the amplitudes of s u u and s v v are comparable in sl both s u u and s v v in sl reveal a discrete peak at s t 0 24 which corresponds to the shedding frequency of the lee vortices off the obstacle the observed s t 0 24 is close to the estimate of s t 0 264 computed from the s t r e d relationship proposed by williamson and brown 1998 for cylinder wakes there is no such periodic component in nosl at this location moving to a further downstream location we find a periodic signal in both components of horizontal velocity and a corresponding spectral peak in both sl and nosl this temporal periodicity is illustrated by fig 9 a for the v component at a downstream location x 9 y 0 and z 0 5 in nosl the spectral peak of v at this location is at s t 0 5 and corresponds to the barotropic sinuous instability of the quasi two dimensional wake lesieur 2008 the barotropic instability of wakes and jets takes the form of a sinuous mode that evolves into two staggered rows of vortices of opposite sign maslowe 1991 perret et al 2011 carpenter and smyth 2019 and under forcing also a varicose mode with two non staggered vortex rows the frequency of this instability in nosl is found to vary with height so that s t takes values between 0 4 and 0 8 however for case sl the vortex shedding frequency does not change with height 3 4 turbulent kinetic energy to quantify the influence of bcs on the wake turbulence snapshots of tke are shown in the central vertical plane y 0 in fig 10 additionally mean velocity vectors are shown at selected streamwise locations to illustrate the overall flow structure in nosl there is strong bottom shear in the recirculation region however the bottom boundary layer is quasi laminar at this moderate r e and furthermore bottom friction restricts the lateral meander of the wake that would generate turbulent fluctuations therefore in the near bottom region of 0 z 0 2 nosl exhibits small tke in the upper region a shear layer forms at the boundary of the recirculation zone with the downslope jet and lee wave to support turbulent fluctuations shown by a zone of enhanced tke fig 10a which spreads vertically with increasing x these fluctuations also trigger instability of the horizontal shear in the wake to eventually allow the spanwise oscillation fig 9 which is seen further downstream in sl the recirculation zone is small the slip bc allows near bottom lateral meanders close to the body as well as broadband fluctuations which are reflected in the high tke content of the flow in the lee of the obstacle unlike nosl a strong upper shear layer does not develop and the tke is bottom intensified 4 vortex dynamics lee vortices which are coherent patches of vertical vorticity ω z with size comparable to the lateral dimensions of the obstacle represent a noticeable pattern in geophysical wakes lee vortices are present in the simulations of stratified flow past an obstacle however boundary conditions affect the spatial organization and the temporal signature of the lee vortices as elaborated in section 4 1 apart from the organized ω z in lee wake vortices there are swirling motions with horizontal vorticity which are associated with internal waves separated shear layers with vertical shear boundary layers and also disorganized turbulence the effect of bcs on ω y is discussed in section 4 2 the mechanism underlying the formation of lee vortices is of interest boundary layer vorticity is generally thought to be the primary source of wake vorticity however in the stratified mountain wake simulated by smolarkiewicz and rotunno 1988 a slip bc was used and attached lee vortices were found the authors attributed the formation of coherent vortices to the generation of horizontal vorticity by baroclinic torque followed by tilting of horizontal vorticity to the vertical obstacle curvature can also induce vorticity into the flow and smith and smith 1995 allude to this mechanism as a possible source of lee vortices vorticity induced by this mechanism is proportional to the tangential velocity of the flow at the obstacle surface as elaborated later in section 4 3 we conduct an additional unstratified simulation sl un to ascertain if curvature alone without baroclinicity can lead to lee vortices and present its results in section 4 3 sl un has the same obstacle geometry and current speed as sl but the background is unstratified section 4 4 includes a quantitative analysis of the vorticity sources to further clarify the generation mechanism of lee wake vortices the area y z integrated value of the squared vorticity in each component is computed and the streamwise evolution is contrasted among various cases furthermore the relative magnitudes of the principal source sinks of vorticity are evaluated to directly assess the importance of baroclinic torque relative to the other sources 4 1 lee wake vortices the organization of vertical vorticity ω z in nosl is strikingly different from sl dl and hybrid cases while the latter three cases resemble each other fig 11 illustrates the difference by showing ω z contours on horizontal planes at four different heights in the wake in nosl fig 11a there is a pair of counter rotating vortices at z 0 066 close to the bottom these lee vortices are found to be steady in time and take the form of an attached recirculation bubble the presentation of these vortices resembles the lee vortex pair found near the bottom in the laboratory experiment of hunt and snyder 1980 and also in aerial observations by smith and grubisic 1993 of the wake of hawaii at the somewhat higher location of z 0 33 too there is a steady recirculation bubble however at the even higher location of z 0 66 the recirculation bubble while remaining attached displays unsteadiness at its tail end and coherent vortices appear further downstream the size of the lee vortices at a given height is proportional to the local diameter d z of the conical obstacle this large scale unsteadiness observed further downstream sets in at heights above z 0 2 through barotropic sinuous instability lesieur 2008 carpenter and smyth 2019 of the velocity profile of a quasi two dimensional wake that develops into coherent vortices in contrast the bottom slip wall in sl allows unsteady shedding of alternating opposite signed kármán vortices from the obstacle their instantaneous presentation is qualitatively different from nosl as can be seen by comparing the z 0 066 and 0 33 planes fig 11b to the corresponding planes in nosl fig 11a the shedding of kármán vortices from the body leads to lateral flapping of the wake which is manifested by the lateral meanders in the streamlines and the oscillation of the centerline lateral velocity which were described previously at z 0 93 the lee waves interfere strongly with the coherent structures in the wake thereby disturbing the vortex street to summarize lee vortices form behind the obstacle independent of the bc furthermore their lateral size at a given height is proportional to the local diameter of the obstacle the critical difference introduced by the type of bc is that the lee vortices in sl are shed off the body unsteadily to result in a kármán vortex street while in nosl there is a quasi steady attached vortex pair the results of previous sections on the mean velocity show that the behavior of dl resembles sl and hybrid fig 12 c depicts contours of ω z in the horizontal plane z 0 25 in the drag law case the corresponding ω z contours for the other bcs which are included for comparison in fig 12 demonstrate that dl hybrid and sl cases are qualitatively similar in terms of vortex dynamics 4 2 spanwise vorticity in addition to the vertically oriented lee vortices there is substantial horizontal vorticity the organization of horizontal vorticity depends on bcs as illustrated by the two orthogonal planar views of ω y in fig 13 for example the boundary layer on the flat bottom provides a significant swath of ω y seen in the horizontal plane with positive values under the current and small negative values under the weak recirculating flow in nosl a feature that is absent in sl fig 13 above the obstacle both cases exhibit ω y associated with the lee wave there is also a thin strip of ω y on the obstacle which is created by the upslope flow followed by the downstream jet this strip separates from the obstacle slightly below its apex and subsequently exhibits the wavelength of the impressed lee wave the flow behind the obstacle in sl shows a disorganized pattern with small scale patches of intense ω y fig 13 b the small scale variability is much less pronounced in nosl evidently for the conditions of this study the boundary layer on the flat bottom is able to restrict wake turbulence 4 3 unstratified wake we have seen that for all bcs considered here there are coherent wake vortices in low f r h flow past a conical obstacle and they take the form of unsteady kármán vortices shed from the body in the sl case both body curvature and baroclinicity have been advanced in the past as potential origins of the wake vorticity to exclude the effect of baroclinicity an unstratified counterpart sl un has been simulated with the slip bc vorticity can be induced by solely body curvature and is proportional to the tangential slip velocity of the flow at the obstacle leal 1989 legendre et al 2009 to demonstrate curvature induced vorticity consider free slip flow past a circular shear free cylinder of radius a in polar coordinates r θ since u r 0 and τ r θ 0 at r a it follows that u θ r u θ a and ω z u θ r u θ r r a 2 u θ a here u θ represents the surface tangential velocity as elaborated below the unstratified counterpart is qualitatively different from the stratified cases in particular although curvature alone does give rise to vorticity lee vortices with size comparable to the body do not form in the wake fig 14 a shows that for case sl un flow separation in the vertical centerplane y 0 occurs at x 0 35 and z 0 3 this is in contrast to the near apex separation in the corresponding stratified case sl left column of fig 5 fig 14 b shows that separation is also delayed in the horizontal z 0 066 plane where it occurs close to the rear stagnation point the flow remains attached to the sloping and curved geometry in sl un for a long distance before separation because of the following reasons a absence of viscous loss of momentum at the boundary and b lack of a lee wave and its imposition of an adverse pressure gradient on the boundary flow it is worth noting that in previous work on unstratified flow past a 3d obstacle with a no slip bc e g garcia villalba et al 2009 flow separation at the obstacle occurs substantially upstream relative to sl un and there is a large recirculation zone followed by a turbulent wake the recirculating flow at the junction of the bottom and central lee of the obstacle generates a narrow wake that develops a sinuous instability in the horizontal plane fig 14 b and c show the streamwise and spanwise velocity respectively in a horizontal plane z 0 066 here this narrow region of attached low velocity fluid in the lee can be noticed along with the subsequent sinuous instability the three components of vorticity are shown in fig 14 d f on a horizontal plane the location of the plane at z 0 066 is sufficiently below the apex so as to include the separated flow in the lee of the obstacle there is vertical vorticity at the body in fig 14 d owing to its curvature in the horizontal plane however the wake behind the body is narrow and does not exhibit the large lee vortices seen in the stratified cases this observation confirms that curvature alone without baroclinicity is insufficient for the emergence of large lee wake vortices that have been observed in geophysical flows spanwise vorticity ω y is predominantly positive adjacent to the obstacle owing to the curvature of the hill in the vertical plane the narrow wake has both spanwise fig 14 e and streamwise fig 14 f vorticity 4 4 sources of vorticity the vorticity transport equation obtained by employing the curl operator on eq 2 is as follows 8 ω i t u j ω i x j ω j u i x j e i j 3 b x j ν 2 ω i x j 2 e i k m x k x j ν s g s u m x j on the right hand side r h s of eq 8 the first term represents vortex stretching tilting and the second term is the baroclinic torque the third and fourth terms are molecular diffusion and the modeled subgrid diffusion respectively both are lumped together into a single diffusion term in the results in the case of an unstratified background boundary layer vorticity diffuses from the obstacle into the flow and is subsequently reoriented and intensified by the vortex stretching tilting term a stratified background provides an additional vorticity source namely the baroclinic torque associated with horizontal density gradients fig 15 is an illustration of the horizontal density contrast on z 0 5 located below the dividing streamline the complex three dimensional flow in the vicinity of the obstacle is responsible for the observed density contrast consider nosl fig 15 a there is colder denser fluid purple immediately upstream of the body on the horizontal plane z 0 5 visualization of the streamlines in the vicinity of z 0 5 shows an upward rise in front of the hill which brings heavier fluid purple from below as the fluid negotiates the hill the streamlines dip downward bringing lighter fluid orange at the sides of hill to the plane z 0 5 in nosl there is an extensive recirculation zone behind the hill which tends to inhibit the lighter fluid from reaching z 0 5 in the lee therefore the patch of light fluid orange does not extend from the sides to behind the hill moving to sl we find that the upstream density contrast is weaker the reason is the absence of a developing upstream boundary layer which in nosl displaces the streamlines and amplifies the upward transport of colder fluid in sl too streamlines dip down as the fluid proceeds past the curved sides of the hill the larger amplitude of vertical and lateral motions behind the obstacle in sl leads to patches of light fluid in the lee fig 15 b which are larger than in nosl consequently the spanwise gradient b y is larger in sl and so is its contribution to baroclinic torque this is the reason why as shown later in the top row of fig 16 ω x behind the obstacle is larger in sl relative to nosl fig 16 shows the streamwise evolution of y z plane integrated values of enstrophy components ω x 2 ω y 2 and ω z 2 in fig 16 1a c vortex stretching in fig 16 2a c vortex tilting in fig 16 3a c diffusion term includes viscous diffusion and the contribution from eddy diffusivity in fig 16 4a c and baroclinic torque in fig 16 5a b in row 3 of fig 16 the vortex tilting term t x t y t z is shown for each vorticity component equation for example t z denotes the vortex tilting term in the ω z equation computed as ω x w x ω y w y similarly in row 4 of fig 16 the diffusion term d x d y d z is shown for each vorticity component equation the absolute value of each term in the vorticity equation is taken before computing the area integral this allows estimation of their relative importance the sign does not matter for this analysis in sl un the enstrophy components are limited to the obstacle with negligible values in the lee fluid can flow over the obstacle since stratification which diverts oncoming fluid sideways around the obstacle is absent hence the spanwise vorticity ω y is much larger than ω z the component ω x is generated by tilting of ω y and ω z owing to viscous dissipation the magnitude of each vorticity component decreases eventually the sl case is strikingly different from sl unalthough the same boundary conditions are in play each vorticity component increases in magnitude from its upstream zero value as the fluid flows past the obstacle fig 16 1a shows that there is significant enstrophy in both horizontal components not just ω y baroclinic torque absent in sl un is a source of both horizontal components and as shown by fig 16 5a it exceeds other sources of vorticity note that the range of the vertical axis is larger for row 5 baroclinic torque relative to the rows showing the other sources the vortex tilting term t z and vortex stretching term ω z w z in rows 3 and 2 of fig 16 a respectively are also substantial thus the simulations demonstrate that baroclinic torque produces horizontal vorticity which is tilted and stretched to give ω z in accord with the lee vortex mechanism proposed by smolarkiewicz and rotunno 1988 vortex tilting reduces in magnitude with increasing downstream distance which lowers the magnitude of ω z relative to the other components as shown in fig 16 1a furthermore the vortex tilt stretch terms are isotropic with no directional preference for any particular component suggesting that these terms are operative at smaller scales of motion baroclinic torque generated by density anomalies in the horizontal is also dominant in nosl shown in fig 16 5b however unlike sl the magnitude of ω y far exceeds the other components as seen in fig 16 1b the reason is that the bottom boundary layer which injects spanwise vorticity into the flow persists over the entire streamwise extent while the wake vorticity which is the primary source of the other vorticity components is dissipated by viscosity 5 summary and discussion both no slip and slip bcs have been employed in past studies of stratified flow past an isolated obstacle no slip is the physically correct bc however when the computational grid is too coarse to resolve the physical boundary layer application of the no slip bc results in an incorrect numerical boundary layer as an alternative geophysical wakes at high reynolds number have been simulated with a slip bc or by the imposition of a drag law which can be viewed as a partial slip boundary condition with the goal of clarifying the role of bc type we conduct simulations with no slip nosl and slip sl bcs of flow past a conical obstacle height h and bottom diameter d in a uniformly stratified background the selected problem has topographic froude number of f r h u 0 n h 0 2 and the reynolds number of r e d u 0 d ν 15 000 is moderate so that les with high resolution of the boundary layer and wake turbulence is possible two additional cases are also simulated a hybrid hybrid case with no slip on the obstacle and slip at the flat bottom and a drag law case dl wherein a quadratic drag law is imposed on the boundaries another important goal is to assess the role of baroclinicity in the observed vortex dynamics the stratified flow at f r h 0 2 exhibits flow blocking upstream of the obstacle streamlines that are diverted to go around rather than over the obstacle an accelerated downslope jet flow separation followed by recirculation a lee wave and wake vortices with organized ω z in the lee many of these flow features are substantially altered by the type of bc notably the lee vortices in nosl take the form of an attached counter rotating vortex pair with little unsteadiness in most of the recirculation region behind the body while in sl dl and hybrid counter rotating vortices are shed off the body to form a kármán vortex street sl dl and hybrid exhibit lateral flapping of the wake which periodically transports fluid with higher streamwise momentum to the centerline and consequently the mean value of centerline defect velocity decreases substantially faster in the near wake relative to nosl at the selected r e d 15 000 bottom friction evidently exerts a strong constraint on the wake that reduces unsteadiness near the body in nosl it is only further downstream x d of this location increases with increasing depth that the wake develops a sinuous barotropic instability the lee wake vortices show vertical variability in size independent of the bc their horizontal size is proportional to the local diameter d z of the conical obstacle the frequency of the vortex shedding that occurs in sl dl and hybrid does not vary with vertical location in the simulated cases spectra of streamwise u and lateral velocity v in the near wake region of sl show discrete peaks at the vortex shedding mode quantified as s t f s d u 0 24 although there is no discrete peak in the near wake region of nosl farther downstream there is a peak in the v spectrum at s t f s d u 0 5 which is visually apparent as a sinuous instability of the wake in the horizontal plane the boundary layers on the flat and sloping bottom are resolved in nosl therefore a laboratory experiment conducted with the present obstacle geometry and r e d 15 000 and f r h 0 2 would be expected to match the results of nosl and not sl dl or hybrid indeed for similar parameters of f r h 0 2 and r e d 13 700 hunt and snyder 1980 report a quasi steady recirculation zone containing an attached counter rotating vortex pair with some irregular unsteadiness in the wake at the moderate r e of the present simulations the boundary layer is laminar and it imposes a wall shear τ w that is steady in time and has a drag coefficient of 0 02 geophysical flows are at high r e with a turbulent boundary layer and a lower c d and a drag law bc is often used to represent the boundary layer the dl case in our study is undertaken with c d 0 0025 and gives results similar to sl and hybrid at high r e of geophysical wakes nosl is inappropriate because the viscous sublayer cannot be resolved and therefore a bc such as dl is appropriate boundary layer vorticity curvature of the body and baroclinicity have been advanced as potential generators of the lee wake vortices an unstratified simulation sl un is conducted to exclude baroclinicity from the generators of vorticity in sl un the flow remains attached over a much larger region the wake that emerges is narrow and large organized lee vortices are absent unstratified simulations with no slip bc have not been conducted here since there are prior laboratory experiments and simulations with the no slip bc of the unstratified configuration the prior studies show vortical structures different from the present lee vortices a standing horseshoe vortex and periodic shedding of hairpin vortices at low r e d acarlar and smith 1987 which changes to intermittent shedding of vortex patches at high r e d garcia villalba et al 2009 therefore we conclude that independent of the choice of bc unstratified flow does not demonstrate lee wake vortices of the type observed in geophysical wakes or in stratified flow laboratory models of said wakes all components of the vorticity are prevalent in the flow as shown by the streamwise evolution of the squared magnitude enstrophy of each vorticity component owing to bl vorticity the spanwise vorticity ω y dominates the other two components upstream and downstream of the hill in the no slip case however the increase in vorticity at the obstacle is similar among the different bcs instantaneous streamlines show opposite signed vertical motion in the aft and lee as the fluid moves past the obstacle leading to the horizontal density gradients which are necessary for the baroclinic torque to be operative in the vorticity balance sources in the equation for each vorticity component are quantified and it is found that the baroclinic torque operative only in the balances for horizontal vorticity components is dominant independent of the bc type vortex stretch and tilt are also substantial the simulation result namely that horizontal vorticity is produced by the baroclinic torque and tilted into the vertical supports the lee vortex mechanism proposed by smolarkiewicz and rotunno 1988 turbulence is quantified through the tke the lateral meanders of the wake in sl lead to high tke in the wake in nosl there is a zone of tke that originates in the vertical shear layer between the fluid in the recirculation zone and the flow above associated with the lee wave

23972,the 200 m thick surface layer of the arctic ocean contains a lower salinity part in the canadian basin receiving fresher water from the pacific ocean as well as rivers and also a higher salinity part in the eurasian basin receiving saltier water from the greenland sea this surface layer receives atmospheric forcing and also partially mixes with the subsurface layer thus thermohaline circulation is a fundamental pattern under the influences of mesoscale features 10 km and small scale plumes 1 km the one box model of the surface layer possesses a salinity driven state and also a convected state with the subsurface layer as another solution the new modeling is proposed with a probability distribution function pdf on the temperature salinity t s plane which can represent horizontal gradients and small scale features as well the t s distribution retains only the probabilities of different water types while their locations are discarded time progressions of the pdf are calculated with mechanisms of box mean progression heterogeneity generation horizontal mixing in the box and convection with the subsurface layer as either the subsurface layer becomes fresher or the heterogeneity is intensified the solution near the salinity driven state increases convection shifting toward the convected state the additional pdf box model is made for the eurasian basin which receives fresher water from the canadian basin instead of the pacific ocean and provides a more restricted solution with convection mainly controlled by the fresher subsurface layer the original pdf box model of the entire arctic ocean is extended to the wider horizontal variability case i e the inflow from the greenland sea is distributed over the higher salinity portion only and then the lower salinity water from the pacific ocean is supplied to a particular t s point t p s p mixing within the lower salinity portion only the low salinity core is retained near t p s p even though convection develops in the higher salinity portion thus this advanced pdf box model is a useful tool to judge a high resolution basin scale circulation model whether small scale plumes and mesoscale features play an important role on thermohaline circulation or not 1 introduction thermohaline ocean circulations are key components over the subtropical and subpolar regions by transporting sea water in the meridional directions in the north atlantic deep convection occurs by atmospheric cooling on warm and salty sea water which is carried by the atlantic meridional overturning circulation amoc the convection plays a role to supply a source for the global conveyer belt making important effects on the amoc the overturning circulation and vertical mixing interact with each other in the arctic ocean also up to now one of the highest resolution models was presented by hamman et al 2017 to study coastal flows from river discharges using 1 12 rotated sphere mesh thus it has not been carried out to resolve convective plumes with grids of 200 m width in the arctic ocean models as of yet hence it would be useful to provide a tool to expect behavior and to examine importance of plumes for basin scale circulations from this viewpoint we propose a model with a probability distribution function pdf implemented in a simple box model as an initial step plumes are produced in an area with vertical instability although static stability is a key mechanism for the vertical mixing it would not be simple to judge the stability of its field with horizontal variability related to mesoscale features and plumes it may be worthwhile to investigate how effective vertical mixing is prior to application of a high resolution model using the simple box model which is maintained by the probability distribution function pdf and has been applied to the meridional overturning in the north atlantic ocean ikeda 1997 the pdf on the temperature salinity t s plane is specified to retain only the probabilities of different water types while their locations are ignored since it could be questionable whether a box model is appropriate as the basic model a brief review is given here on the box model approach to study thermohaline circulation which was initiated by stommel 1961 the study took a simple box model to explore the dynamical principle of the global thermohaline circulation suggesting that there are two stable steady states along with one unstable state one steady state is driven by a density distribution due to temperature while the other is driven by a salinity induced density distribution however depending on the forcing terms there is only one steady state driven by salinity this pioneering work has been cited as the basis of regional thermohaline circulations by various authors rahmstorf et al 2005 compared a dozen numerical models either one or two stable states under the current atmospheric forcing by plotting hysteresis curves olbers and zhang 2008 compared ordinary box models with low order spectral models which could justify the box modeling approach with additional behavior such as a limit cycle in the latter case it is noted that these box modeling approaches including ikeda 1997 examined the role of the subpolar area on sensitivity of the thermohaline circulation with the subtropical area the sensitive state is caused by bimodality of the circulation i e a sudden freshening could switch the circulation from massive northward flow at the temperature driven state to delicate southward flow near the sea surface at the salinity driven state among such a main stream suggestion the pdf box model showed relative robustness of the present thermohaline circulation which exists essentially at the temperature driven state partly containing the convected state ikeda 1997 although the common mechanisms maintain the circulation in the arctic ocean and the gin greenland iceland and norwegian seas the present application focuses on sensitivity of vertical mixing in the surface subsurface layer of the arctic ocean which retains the lower density due to fresher water at the salinity driven state the thermohaline circulation in the arctic ocean and gin seas is now described as shown in fig 1 in the upper ocean above 500 m depth of the arctic ocean circulation is primarily driven by the buoyancy flux due to the low salinity water from the river discharges atmosphere and the pacific aagaard and carmack 1989 woodgate et al 2012 the surface layer above 200 m depth possesses the beaufort gyre and transpolar drift stream and exchanges sea water with the north atlantic through the fram strait and partly the barents sea the more saline atlantic water flows toward the canadian basin amerasian basin mainly in the subsurface layer around the depth of 200 to 500 m with some components entering into the surface layer and partly circulates back into the north atlantic rudels 2012 rudels et al 2015 it has been known that this water exchange is mainly caused by the density difference between the atlantic water and the less saline upper ocean the additional forcing is related to the density difference between the atlantic inflow and the heavier lower ocean below 500 m depth in the arctic ocean wind forcing contributes to the clockwise circulation in the surface layer of the canada basin although the wind driven component is more crucial for temporal variability as suggested by spall 2013 and ikeda 2014 the most remarkable change in the arctic sea ice cover is the reducing trend over the last 40 years or longer this trend is qualitatively consistent with the warming atmosphere but waits for a quantitative explanation walsh et al 2011 the ice cover in summer is predicted to become minimal near the end of the 21st century in the ipcc report however the observed ice decrease seems to be proceeding faster under a summer ice albedo feedback stroeve et al 2012 the atlantic water in the subsurface layer has relatively warmer and more saline characteristics in the arctic ocean while it receives a colder and more saline input from ice formation in the barents sea jones 2001 as the warming proceeds this input is weakened leaving the subsurface layer warmer and less saline than before lien and trofimov 2013 besides the barents sea branch sea ice cover has reduced to north of svalbard caused by the warmer fram strait branch onarheim et al 2014 this trend will induce the subsurface layer to be warmer and less saline than before for the investigation of vertical mixing in the arctic ocean the active box is set within the upper part of the arctic ocean which interacts with the gin seas in the present study a major issue is how easily the surface layer mixes with the subsurface layer in the case when the atlantic water with less salinity input is flowing into the arctic ocean through the barents sea hence the surface layer in the entire arctic ocean is set as an active box partly mixing with the subsurface layer which is set as a lower box the surface layer exchanges water with the gin seas as the additional model only the eurasian basin part with higher salinity is taken as an active box interacting with the lower salinity part in the canadian basin as well fig 1b since only the surface layer is chosen as the active box the interactions between the subsurface layer and the gin seas are not solved as part of the box model while the subsurface layer is prescribed as the component external to the active box it is noted that water temperature shows very minor contrast between the canadian and eurasian basins fig 1c the sea ice cover is thicker 3m in the canadian basin compared to 1 5m in the eurasian basin bourke and garrett 1987 the other issue to be considered is the role of a wind driven basin wide circulation which could modify the bimodality of thermohaline circulation guan and huang 2008 in the present study we consider that the wind driven component modifies the position of the major routes of water exchange between the arctic ocean and the gin seas but gives a minor effect on the mass transport of the density driven circulation ikeda 1987 as far as this effect has been examined on decadal variability using general circulation models along with observed data the exchange transport receives only a secondary effect e g ikeda 2014 first of all the simple box model is introduced for the surface layer of the arctic ocean which is forced with the atmosphere freshwater flux and other components and interacts with the gin seas in section 2 the pdf box model is explained in section 3 and then the model results are presented for the sensitivity of vertical mixing between the surface and subsurface layers in section 4 main foci are given on the reduction in the subsurface layer density and the effects of horizontal heterogeneity the active box is then limited to the eurasian basin part in section 5 for providing the behavior of the higher salinity part in the arctic ocean following these basic pdf box models the model is extended toward uneven distribution of the atlantic water and the pacific water inflows in section 6 it is shown how the sensitivities to the subsurface layer density and the horizontal heterogeneity are changed a summary is given in section 7 along with the salinity density reduction in the subsurface layer quantitatively estimated under the warming trend a suggestion is provided for application of the pdf to three dimensional numerical models 2 simple box model of the arctic ocean in the canadian and the eurasian basins 2 1 model description having the common concept with the subpolar model used in ikeda 1997 the simple box model is defined first as shown in fig 2 while the box model will be switched to the eurasian basin part in section 5 it is noted that various references were cited by ikeda 1997 within the upper ocean above 500 m depth of both canadian basin and eurasian basin the surface layer with 200 m thickness containing cold fresher water is set as a single active box which mainly has the pacific origin water coming through the bering strait this box receives atmospheric cooling hence sea ice formation negative salinity flux due to the river discharges precipitation minus evaporation and the pacific inflow these fluxes are combined and represent the atmospheric forcing term in the present model the subsurface layer underneath the surface layer is filled with the atlantic origin water from the gin seas through the fram strait with significant influences of the barents sea the surface layer flows out to the gin seas receiving the atlantic origin water which comes from the gin seas and circulates along the siberian continental slope the low salinity outflow through the canadian archipelago is included with the outflow through the fram strait the surface layer could also be convected with the subsurface layer depending on the density difference between these two layers it is noted that the wide continental shelf areas are not explicitly included in the surface layer box while the river discharges are considered to penetrate through the shelf areas into the surface layer temperature and salinity t and s are calculated from 2 1a d t d t k t t a t k b t b t q s t s t 2 1b d s d t k s s a s k b s b s q s s s s where t is time the subscripts a

the upper ocean t 0 0 0 c and s 0 34 7 ppt the subsurface layer property is set on the basis of the average over the canadian basin and the eurasian basin by referring to jones 2001 polyakov et al

responses of a few years and salinity over a hundred years the crucial point is that the salinity force works more persistently than the thermal force does the effects of the gin seas are dependent on the density difference between the active box and the gin seas which have t s t 0 2 c and s s s 0 0 3 ppt the solutions are compared with observed data for verification of these parameters in this section in addition a sensitivity study is carried out to examine the effects of the parameters the water temperature and salinity are assumed to have linear profiles in the surface box as shown in fig 3 this assumption is reasonable in comparison with the observed profiles in the eurasian basin polyakov et al 2012 while it is still acceptable in the canadian basin proshutinsky et al 2009 the values at the bottom of the surface layer are set equal to those of the subsurface layer t b and s b the values at the mid depth are equal to the vertical averages and represent the surface layer temperature t and salinity s atmospheric cooling warming is calculated from the temperature at the sea surface t t o p 2 t t b as cooling is given to the sea surface t responds to atmospheric forcing once t t o p reaches the freezing point t f 2 c the negative difference is converted to sea ice formation here the temperature equivalent to the total heat in the ice water system is retained as t while the actual liquid water temperature is denoted as t w and its value at the sea surface is t w t o p the actual liquid water salinity s w is determined from the sum of equivalent salinity s and brine rejection see appendix a for the relationship among t s t w and s w and fig a 1 also it is noted that the surface layer acts as a whole even though the vertical profiles are set with linear gradients under these settings eq 2 1 is revised as 2 5a d t d t k t t a t w t o p k b t b t w q s t s t 2 5b d s d t k s s a s k b s b s w q s s s s where the atmospheric forcing on salinity is set to be calculated with s the vertical mixing effects are calculated from t w and s w as the actual liquid water only mixes with the subsurface layer the effects of water exchange with the gin seas are based on t and s under the assumption that the combined ice water system flows out here the water density is determined from t w and s w in eq 2 2 sea ice tends to prevent the air sea heat flux i e the heat flux is reduced with higher ice concentration and thickness then the air sea heat flux coefficient k t is expressed with ice thickness at the lowest order as 2 6 k t k t ex p ρ i ρ w h i h i e thus once ρ w h i e ρ i is assumed to be 2 m air sea heat flux with 3 m thick ice is estimated to be about 20 of the ice free state ice deformation and concentration are not explicitly included in the box model while the effects of open leads and ice ridges can be considered in this formulation i e the annual mean of 3 m thick ice may have about 30 of an ice free portion in fall when sea ice becomes thinner and sparser by averaging the seasonally variable ice thickness for one year the annual mean heat flux may be about 20 of the no ice state it is noted that the present model retains neither seasonal cycles nor synoptic variations and also neither ice movement nor deformation is explicitly resolved hence we should be concerned with the sea ice conditions thickness and air sea heat flux using the sea ice formulation with 2 6 under the air temperature of t a 5 0 c the model sensitivity is examined on the coefficient h i e in this section 2 2 results the simple box model is used to examine how the solutions converge in time from various initial conditions toward steady solutions as shown in fig 4 there are two steady solutions to which time dependent solutions converge during the time progressions for 10 years one of the steady solutions is the salinity driven one es 1 and the other is the convected one es 3 under the condition specified here the temperature driven state does not exist as shown in appendix b es 1 has the equivalent temperature t 2 25 c at the mid depth mean in the box and t t o p 4 5 c at the surface following eq a 1 ice thickness is h i 3 472 m and then the equivalent salinity s 33 27 derives the liquid water salinity s w 33 80 from eq a 2 as calculated in appendix c it is noted that the model sea ice is a little thicker than the observed one about 3m to 1 5 m bourke and garrett 1987 giving influence on higher water salinity than the data fig 1b es 3 has the state identical to the subsurface layer t t w 0 c and s s w 34 3 without sea ice the annual mean heat flux terms in eq 2 5a at es 1 are the air sea flux of 11 w m 2 the vertical mixing less than 1 w m 2 and the inflow from the gin seas of about 10 w m 2 as shown in appendix c it is noted that those three heat flux terms do not balance completely among themselves because the time dependent solutions are not exactly identical with es 1 in the period of 10 years once the model area is estimated as 2000 km 2000 km the surface layer volume is 8 1014 m3 and the volume transport between the surface layer and the gin seas is 2 3 106 m3 s 1 2 3 sv the salinity fluxes in eq 2 5b are evaluated to be 0 372 10 8 ppt s 1 from the atmosphere 0 049 10 8 ppt s 1 caused by vertical mixing and 0 319 10 8 ppt s 1 from the gin seas as shown in appendix c for the entire model domain the negative salinity flux from the first term is 3 0 106 ppt m3 s 1 and compared with the contribution by the river discharges precipitation minus evaporation and the pacific water inflow the third term is 2 6 106 ppt m3 s 1 as the water exchange through the fram strait including the barents sea the volume transport 2 3 sv between the surface layer and the gin seas is compared with the observed transport where the comparison is made at the lowest order schauer et al 2004 reported volume and heat transports across the zonal section near 80 n in the fram strait the northward flow of the atlantic water was identified with temperature higher than 1 c in the upper 500 m ocean their fig 2 and possessed an annual mean transport of about 4 sv the surface layer in the top 200 m occupies about half of this transport providing consistency with the present model result the negative salt flux which includes river discharges precipitation minus evaporation and also the inflow through the bering strait is 0 372 10 8 ppt s 1 and converted to the freshwater flux of 2 25 10 8 m s 1 on the layer with a thickness of 200 m and salinity of 33 ppt or the annual flux of 70 cm yr 1 according to aagaard and carmack 1989 river discharges are 35 cm yr 1 precipitation minus evaporation is 9 cm yr 1 and the inflow through the bering strait is 18 cm yr 1 it is noted that the present model does not represent the shelf areas explicitly in addition aagaard and carmack 1989 set the reference salinity at 34 8 ppt so that we may make a comparison only at the lowest order the more recent observations have shown an increase in the bering strait inflow after 2000 woodgate et al 2012 suggesting that careful projection is required for the future state in the arctic ocean sensitivity of the simple box model was examined by varying the model parameters as shown in table 1 in the ranges of year to year variability in the temperature and salinity values of the forcing terms the results are represented by sea ice thickness all cases have es 1 as steady states the atmosphere warmer by 0 5 c yields sea ice thinner by 0 6 m it is noted that this warming corresponds to the reduction in the air sea heat flux through the open water portion associated with the temperature difference between the freezing point and the air temperature from 3 c to 2 5 c the freshwater flux reduced by about a quarter results in 0 6 m thicker ice for which a smaller density difference with the gin seas reduces the water exchange and cools down the surface layer the gin seas box gives the surface layer qualitatively consistent effects i e the warmer gin seas tend to reduce ice thickness and the fresher gin seas reduce the water exchange with the surface layer and increase sea ice thickness the warmer subsurface layer also reduces sea ice thickness while the fresher one increases vertical mixing and reduces sea ice thickness it is noted that these model parameters are varied independently although the actual fields may vary with some relationship e g the subsurface layer directly receives influences from the gin seas these sensitivity tests suggest that the uncertainty in the forcing parameters induces only minor differences in the solutions the final case has the ice shielding twice as effective as the basic case halving sea ice thickness by keeping the atmospheric cooling nearly equal to that of the reference case as the pdf box model is examined quantitatively under the warming trend in section 4 5 and 6 more specific sensitivity results are presented the annual cycle was added by a sinusoidal fluctuation in the air temperature with an amplitude of 10 c although the solutions are not presented here the solutions converge to es 1 with fluctuations in the mid depth equivalent temperature with amplitudes of about 0 1 c which corresponds to ice thickness of 0 3 m however there is no significant impact on the annual mean states main results of the box model are summarized in the surface layer of the arctic ocean two steady states are the salinity driven state and the convected state while no temperature driven state appears sea ice is effective to shield the sea surface from atmospheric cooling and also to determine the salinity distribution 3 basic pdf box model of the arctic ocean in the canadian and the eurasian basins the method of the probability distribution function pdf was initially proposed in ikeda 1997 which fully described the formulation and can be referred to for details hence the concept is described here along with the necessary equations for solving the present problem although the box model is used in the present study to examine responses of the arctic ocean without resolving horizontal variability it may be useful to examine roles of the variability the real arctic ocean contains spatial variability caused by atmospheric forcing e g synoptic low pressure systems since a box model covers the entire arctic ocean horizontal variability includes spatial gradients of water properties also e g the contrast between the canadian and the eurasian basins fig 1b the sea ice cover which contains pack ice ice ridges and open leads yields horizontal variability with sizes from a kilometer to hundreds the combination of wind stresses and the ice cover causes wind driven ice edge upwelling as typical variability in the ocean mesoscale eddies and plumes are usual features in the arctic ocean using the pdf defined on the t s plane the evolution of horizontal variability is tracked where external forcing and internal mixing are parameterized thus instead of a high resolution model spatial heterogeneity is considered while the positions of spatially heterogeneous features are discarded the pdf is defined at discrete grids i j on the t s plane p p i j at t i s j t r e f s r e f i δ t j δ s with t r e f s r e f to be reference values as shown in fig 5a the sum of p i j is 1 the grid size is chosen as δ t δ s 0 1 0 05 the mean values in the box model are expressed as 3 1 t s t r e f s r e f i j p i j t i p i j s j four types of evolution of p i j are shown in fig 5b i e unidirectional shift caused by external forcing heterogeneity generation due to external and internal forcing convergence related to horizontal mixing and shift toward the subsurface layer values due to convection it is noted that some internal processes redistribute horizontal variability e g mesoscale instability separates fronts into eddies plumes often develop under ice formation even in the fields with gentle horizontal gradients the unidirectional shift is first formulated and estimated the time derivatives dt dt ij and ds dt ij dt dt and ds dt at the grid point i j are related with the external forcing as specified by eq 2 5a and 2 5b the terms t t w t w t o p s and s w are replaced with the values at the grid point i j 3 2a d p i j d t p i j d t d t i j δ t d s d t i j δ s 3 2b d p i n j d t p i j d t d t i j δ t n 1 f o

over the t s grids as shown in the appendix of ikeda 1997 this formulation expresses the effects of the external forcing on the grid points in the particular ways e g the uniform forcing of atmosphere and the uniform volume of the gin seas inflow the modulated formulations are introduced for the advanced pdf model in section 6 such as the gin seas inflow concentrated on the higher salinity grid points the heterogeneity generation is represented by conversion from a higher to lower value of pdf between each set of adjacent grids 3 3a d p i j d t d p i 1 j d t d t p i 1 j p i j δ t δ t 3 3b d

coefficients d t and d s are estimated based on the fluxes of the atmospheric forcing freshwater flux and water inflow from the external seas the box model receives the heat flux of 10 8 k s 1 and the salt flux of 0 5 10 8 ppt s 1 section 2 once the pdf expands over 1 k along the t axis the coefficient of d t 10 9 k2 s 1 corresponds to a temporal variability of 10 9 s 1 this scale is 10 of the box mean state and may be reasonable as the forcing to produce the horizontal variability the pdf over 0 5 ppt along the s axis can be supported by the coefficient of d s 0 25 10 9 ppt2 s 1 giving also the scale 10 of the mean state these coefficient values are chosen as references and examined in the sensitivity study section 4 horizontal mixing within the surface layer box is formulated by convergence of the pdf from two grids toward the mid point grid between the two in the t s plane for this internal mixing the same amounts of two water types are transferred to the mid point as categorized in two cases case 1 the convected es 3 grid at i j and the non convected portion at i j 3 5 d p i j d t 2 d p i j d t 2 d p i j d t m 0 p i j p i j f o r i i j j 2 i 2 j limited to those with the mid points matching the grid points the water distribution is assumed that the convected blobs are well dispersed over the surface layer while i j is often far from the main group on the pdf plane this assumption for the basic pdf model will be modified so that the mixing is limited to a higher salinity region for the advanced pdf model in section 6 case 2 among the non convected portion 3 6 d p i j d t 2 d p i m j n d t m 1 p i m j n p i m j n f o r m n 1 1 1 0 0 1 1 1 limited to four sets between eight adjacent grid points around i j representing the mixing with the other water components similar to the one concerned on the assumption that the water properties vary gradually in space except for the convected portion this mixing formulation may represent horizontal mixing well horizontal mixing is induced by ocean currents and eddies along with waves such as internal gravity waves the mixing rate is evaluated with velocity horizontal length scale 0 1 ms 1 100 km 1 0 6 s 1 it is noted that the external forcing produces artificial heterogeneity numerical instability under the numerical format as shown by eq 3 2 therefore the mixing should cancel the artificial effects it is an open question how wide the mixing domain is on the t s plane among the non convected portion case 2 if the mixing takes place within the domain of 5 grid points of temperature and salinity each almost dozen pairs of grid points should be included and summed for the formula this state is represented by four pairs only with m n 1 0 0 1 1 1 and 1 1 and then the coefficient m 1 may be increased about several times on the other hand horizontal mixing may be weaker in the non convected regions than around the convected points this sensitivity is examined with the case study in section 4 caused by convection with the subsurface layer p i j is converted to p i j for a density difference smaller than 3 ρ m where ρ m 0 001 kg m 3 once convection occurs it is assumed that vertical mixing continues within one time step 1 day here until it reaches complete mixture after ice melting a test case with the mixing spreading for 100 days gives a common tendency with the 1 day case it is assumed that plumes exist all over the model domain and are equally mixed with the other water masses in section 4 in section 6 however the model is examined under the horizontal mixing with the convected portion limited to a certain water type e g the mixing takes place only with the portion of higher salinity or density the pdf proceeds in time through eq 3 2 3 3 3 5 and 3 6 with an initial condition concentrated at one grid on the t s plane only in a test case an initial condition is set with two grids of different water types since the cores expand within a relatively short time a few years the solutions are not sensitive to the initial pdf distribution as shown in section 4 the time step is chosen to be 1 day the schematic pdf of the observed t and s is produced for verification of the model results in fig 6 it is noted that the equivalent temperature t and salinity s in the total ice water system are calculated with the actual liquid water temperature t w in fig 1 c and salinity s w in fig 1 b along with sea ice thickness h i as shown in appendix a the representative h i is 3 m in the canadian basin and 1 5 m in the eurasian basin bourke and garrett 1987 sea ice formed at the sea surface contributes to a decrease in t relative to the observed t w as expressed by 3 7 c f ρ i ρ w h i t w t h 1 this relationship is consistent with eq a 1 for the model using the information provided in section 2 and eq a 2 also the equivalent temperature and salinity are calculated from the liquid water temperature and salinity t w s w 1 5 32 5 in the canadian basin and 1 5 34 0 in the eurasian basin i e t s 2 6 32 1 and 2 0 33 8 in the canadian and eurasian basins respectively once the ice thickness increases to 15 m in 10 of the canadian basin due to ridging t s can be modified to be 3 1 31 9 the pdf has two peaks on the lower and the higher s corresponding to the canadian basin and the eurasian basin respectively as shown in fig 6 4 basic pdf box model results of the arctic ocean in the canadian and eurasian basins 4 1 basic model behavior the model is run for 40 years with the initial condition of t 0 and several s values around s 34 0 all cases are listed on table 2 with varying values for s b d t d s m 1 and m 0 the standard case 20 is investigated in this subsection while the probability model is examined first without the heterogeneity generation d t d s 0 in case 30 in comparison with the simple box model as shown in fig 7 the solution closely converges to es 1 from t s 0 33 7 i e the solution exactly matches with the simple box model the pdf is distributed mainly concentrated over about dozen grids around the mean t s values although the external forcing produces artificial heterogeneity due to the numerical scheme eq 3 2 the mixing tends to stabilize the artificial effects for the standard case in fig 8a the solution progressively approaches es 1 the pdf spreads having the core part with widths of 1 5 along the t axis and 1 2 along the s axis starting with different initial conditions of s in fig 8b the solutions converge to either one near es 1 or the other near es 3 from the initial condition at es 3 the solution shifts toward es 1 with the s value being smaller than es 3 by 0 1 from s 33 9 the solution initially moves toward es 1 and then changes direction in a couple of years around t s 1 6 33 8 toward es 3 thus the heterogeneity tends to spread the pdf allowing a small component to convect with the subsurface layer and then horizontal mixing between the es 3 grid and the other part pulls the solution toward es 3 as the solution converges to es 3 the pdf at the subsurface layer value t s 0 0 34 3 occupies about 30 here let us look at the boundary which separates the region converging toward es 3 and the region toward es 1 the boundary exists in the vicinity of es 3 at around s 34 2 using the simple box model fig 4 i e no progression occurs from the direction toward es 1 to the opposite side toward es 3 in the standard case of the probability model the boundary exists at around s 33 8 as sea ice grows due to cooling the water salinity increases to s w 34 1 around the turning point t s 1 6 33 8 it is noted that the difference between s and s w matches with the formulation shown in fig a 1 i e s w s s is 0 01 at t 1 6 thus the salinity difference reduces to 0 2 between the surface layer and the subsurface layer enhancing the shift toward es 3 it is remarked that once the mean property exceeds the boundary toward es 3 it will never come back to the other side for the cases shown above the initial pdf is concentrated on one grid while the initial state with two pdf components is examined i e 0 75 at t s 0 33 5 and 0 25 at t s 0 34 3 the t s evolution is very similar to the one with a single pdf component of unity at t s 0 33 7 no figure shown thus the solution is not sensitive to an initial state with a minor pdf component at the es 3 grid 4 2 vertical mixing caused by reduction in the subsurface layer salinity in response to ice formation reduction in the barents sea the atlantic origin water in the subsurface layer tends to receive less brine rejection and then reduces its salinity in case 22 when s b and hence the bottom boundary condition of the surface layer are changed to 34 2 the solution starting from t s 0 0 33 7 converges to the asymptotic solution in the vicinity of es 3 fig 9a from various initial conditions of s between 33 2 and 34 2 only one equilibrium exists near es 3 fig 9b around the turning point t s 2 1 33 4 the water salinity s w 33 8 seems close enough to s b so that the solution may move toward es 3 although s b s w is around 0 4 the turning point is close to es 1 because the external forcing may be too weak to pull the solution toward es 1 the pdf of the equilibrium solution has a peak at es 3 along with a ridge around t s of the solution fig 9a a balance has been achieved between the heterogeneity generation and the mixing of the convected portion near es 3 with the others the heterogeneity generation tends to disperse the pdf among which the portion in the smaller t and s area is pulled toward es 1 due to the external forcing and also mixes with the convected portion as a result the pdf stays around the ridge case 21 is set with s b 34 25 in between cases 20 and 22 without a figure the regression becomes extremely slow near es 1 keeping one equilibrium solution in the vicinity of s 33 5 and the other equilibrium exists near es 3 the turning point exists around t s 2 0 33 6 from these three cases it can be claimed that the equilibrium states are very sensitive to the value of s b the important statement from these three cases is that as the subsurface salinity comes close to the surface salinity gradual progression occurs from the equilibrium near es 1 to the other near es 3 even if s b increases again no return occurs to the equilibrium near es 1 4 3 model sensitivity to heterogeneity generation and horizontal mixing as the heterogeneity generation is doubled in case 33 the solution starting from t s 0 33 7 converges to es 3 fig 10a the progressions from various initial s values converge toward es 3 without any convergence toward es 1 fig 10b the asymptotic solution departs slightly more from es 3 compared with the one in case 20 fig 8b i e the distance is increased by the heterogeneity strength in cases 31 and 32 when only one of d t and d s is doubled respectively the solutions have basically the same but slightly weaker tendency toward es 3 than case 33 no figure shown in case 33 the boundary between the region toward es 3 and the region toward es 1 shifts to t s 2 0 33 5 or a smaller s than case 20 as sea ice formation increases the water salinity to s w 33 9 around the turning point t s 2 0 33 5 the salinity difference becomes 0 4 between the surface layer and the subsurface layer thus the stronger heterogeneity generation allows the wider convergence toward es 3 in section 4 2 it has been shown that the subsurface salinity s b reduced to 34 2 supports the solution to converge toward es 3 fig 9a the sensitivity of the convergence is examined for the horizontal mixing coefficients m 1 and m 0 in case 34 with m 1 reduced by a factor of 0 5 the solution shows negligible differences from case 22 no figure shown thus the solutions are insensitive to the mixing within the non convected portion in case 35 when the mixing with the es 3 grid m 0 is reduced by a factor of 0 5 the solution shows weaker convergence toward es 3 with a longer ridge toward es 1 fig 11 than case 22 fig 9a the case study has confirmed that m 0 is more influential on the convergence toward es 3 than m 1 by mixing the non convected portion with the es 3 grid and pulling the pdf toward es 3 it is noted that the sensitivity to the mixing parameters is shown for the cases when horizontal mixing is assumed to take place between the es 3 grid and all other t s grids in this section the sensitivity is further examined in section 6 for more realistic cases of the arctic ocean under the horizontal mixing limited to certain water types 5 box model of the eurasian basin 5 1 simple box model the arctic ocean surface layer shows the clear contrast of water salinity in the climate data fig 1b i e salinity is around 32 5 ppt in the canadian basin while it is 34 0 34 5 ppt in the eurasian basin the high salinity water flows into the eurasian basin from the gin seas and the low salinity water in the canadian basin mixes with the eurasian basin the vertical structure is set common as the basic model in section 2 fig 2 divided into the surface subsurface and lower layers convection with the subsurface layer tends to occur more easily in the higher salinity part hence the eurasian basin is taken as an active box and shown in fig 12 the governing equations are similar to those of the basic model in section 2 and hence the differences only are described the equations to calculate temperature and salinity t and s are modified from eq 2 5 to 5 1a d t d t k t t a t w t o p k b t b t w q s t s t q c t c t 5 1b d s d t k s s a s k b s b s w q s s s s q c s c s where the subscripts a b s and c denote atmosphere subsurface layer bottom box gin seas southern box and the canadian basin respectively the actual liquid water temperature is denoted as t w with t w t o p at the sea surface and the actual liquid water salinity is s w the density is calculated from t w and s w using eq 2 2 and the vertical interaction coefficient is determined from eq 2 3 water exchange with the gin seas is induced at a rate of 5 2a q s c s ρ s ρ ρ c 2 where c s 2 0 10 8 kg 1 m3 s 1 this formula reflects that the transport is determined from a density difference between the gin seas and the average in the arctic ocean where the eurasian basin is set to have the same horizontal size as the canadian basin the coefficient c s is twice as large as that in section 2 based on the assumption that the inflow from the gin seas spreads over the eurasian basin whose area is a half of the arctic ocean water exchange with the canadian basin occurs at a rate of 5 2b q c c c ρ c ρ where c c 0 5 10 8 kg 1 m3 s 1 the water exchange takes place due to eddy induced mixing across the transpolar drift stream and may be less efficient than the exchange between the arctic ocean and the gin seas the water property in the canadian basin is set as t c t 0 3 c and s c s 0 2 2 ppt since the eurasian basin receives less freshwater than the entire arctic ocean does the freshwater flux is reduced to a half k s 0 01 10 8 s 1 the other model parameters are common with the basic simple box model in section 2 i e t a t 0 5 0 c s a s 0 20 0 ppt k t 2 10 8 s 1 t s t 0 2 c and s s s 0 0 3 ppt the effects of water exchange with the canadian basin and the gin seas are based on t and s under the assumption that the combined ice water system flows in and out the solutions are compared with observed data for verification of these parameters in this section the solutions shown in fig 13 are consistent with those of the basic model in section 2 there are two steady solutions the salinity driven one es 1 and the convected one es 3 es 1 has the equivalent temperature t 1 66 c at the mid depth and t t o p 3 3 c at the surface following eq a 1 ice thickness is h i 1 833 m the equivalent salinity is s 33 78 and the liquid water salinity is s w 34 06 from eq a 2 thus the average of the eurasian basin and the canadian basin is t s 2 33 33 14 and very close to the one in section 2 es 3 has the state identical to the subsurface layer t t w 0 c and s s w 34 3 without sea ice 5 2 pdf box model the pdf box model of the eurasian basin is set similar to that of the entire arctic ocean section 3 the unidirectional shift reflects the replacement of eq 2 5 with eq 5 1 for the simple box model to which the parameters are matched most of the parameter values in the pdf box model are common with the basic pdf model in section 3 except for the heterogeneity generation terms d t and d s in section 3 the pdf represents the contrast between the canadian and the eurasian basins in addition to the gradients within each basin as well as mesoscale eddies and plumes for the eurasian basin model the contrast between the two basins should be excluded based on the overview of t s distributions in the arctic ocean and the eurasian basin the distribution size of the latter is estimated to be about a half of the former one fig 1b hence d t and d s of the eurasian basin are reduced by a factor of 0 25 from those of the entire arctic ocean i e d t 0 25 10 9 k2 s 1 and d s 0 25 0 25 10 9 ppt2 s 1 the model sensitivity is examined to these two parameters here the model is run for 40 years starting with t s 0 0 33 7 the subsurface salinity s b is varied for four cases listed in table 3 in case 40 with s b 34 3 the solution converges to es 1 in a consistent way with the simple box model fig 14 the pdf distribution is concentrated around es 1 as s b reduces the solutions tend to move toward es 3 in case 43 with s b 34 15 the solution approaches es 3 fig 15 while the tendency is less drastic than the basic pdf model section 4 i e the solution approaches es 3 with s b 34 2 in case 22 fig 9a the model sensitivity to the heterogeneity generation terms is examined by increasing d t and d s by a factor of two in case 44 the model progression and the pdf distribution are similar to those in case 40 no figure shown thus the pdf model becomes more robust to horizontal heterogeneity in the box model of the eurasian basin separated from the canadian basin the results of the eurasian basin model are used to verify the pdf model extended toward uneven distribution of the atlantic water and the pacific water inflows in section 6 6 separation of water inflows in the pdf box model of the arctic ocean in the canadian and the eurasian basins in the study presented to this point the active box contains horizontal variability without any information of geographical locations it is noted that the arctic ocean surface layer contains two groups of salinity values in the climate data fig 1b i e higher salinity in the eurasian basin and lower salinity in the canadian basin under the consideration of more realistic situations in the arctic ocean it is useful to examine how the pdf box model behaves with uneven distributions of the atlantic water and pacific water inflows convection tends to occur more easily in the region with a higher ratio of the atlantic water the simple box model is first examined in section 6 1 with the pacific inflow separated from the atmospheric forcing here some of the river discharges are treated to be combined with the pacific inflow next the pdf box model is examined in section 6 2 where the atlantic water from the gin seas is distributed to some restricted portion of the pdf domain which is chosen on the basis of salinity the pdf box model is also modified with the pacific inflow into a single pdf grid mixing with the restricted pdf domain near by the pacific inflow grid 6 1 separation of freshwater flux in the simple box model in this section the pacific inflow and the river discharges are categorized as low s inflow and separated from precipitation minus evaporation since the pacific inflow stays in the canadian basin for long time and partly spreads toward the eurasian basin some portion of the pacific water directly flows out toward the gin seas and also through the canadian archipelago the river discharges penetrate through the shelf areas into the surface layer of the canadian basin the uneven distribution may have a significant impact on the vertical convection and should be considered in the pdf model while the simple box model is first used to examine the solutions such as es 1 the governing equations 2 5 for t and s are modified with additional terms 6 1a d t d t k t t a t w t o p k b t b t w q s t s t q p t p t 6 1b d s d t k s s a s k b s b s w q s s s s q p s p s where subscript p denotes the low s inflow a main effect is on the salinity flux although the heat flux term is also separated to maintain consistency the horizontal mixing of the low s inflow with the surrounding water takes place in prior to the spreading over the canadian basin it is crucial for the pdf model that the product of this mixing appears within a reasonable pdf domain size providing the source water for the low salinity component in the canadian basin the inflow is given a rate of q p 0 4 10 8 s 1 with t p t 0 2 0 c and s p s 0 2 2 ppt among the terms estimated as atmospheric forcing in section 2 2 precipitation minus evaporation is minor compared with the bering strait inflow and the river discharges hence only k s is reduced by 70 to be 0 006 10 8 s 1 from the basic box model while the others are not changed i e t a t 0 5 0 c s a s 0 20 0 ppt and k t 2 10 8 s 1 the solutions are compared with those in the basic case when the low s inflow is combined with the atmospheric forcing in section 2 in fig 16 the progressions are extremely similar to those of the basic case in fig 4 i e there are two equilibrium states es 1 and es 3 es 1 has the equivalent temperature t 2 16 c and the equivalent salinity s 33 26 ppt the first term in eq 6 1b is evaluated to be 0 111 10 8 ppt s 1 from k s 0 006 10 8 s 1 and the salinity difference between s a and s the fourth term is 0 304 10 8 ppt s 1 based on q p 0 4 10 8 s 1 and s p s the sum of these two terms 0 415 10 8 ppt s 1 has a little 10 larger magnitude than the term 0 372 10 8 ppt s 1 defined as the atmospheric forcing for the basic model in section 2 it is noted that the actual transport is maintained by the pacific inflow through the bering strait as well as water exchange with the shelf areas the net southward flow through the fram strait plays a role to take a balance of water mass in the arctic ocean although the outflows are combined into the water exchange with the gin seas in the present model the net inflow can be taken out by the transport through the canadian archipelago in the real field as well 6 2 separation of the atlantic and the pacific inflows in the pdf box model in the surface layer of the arctic ocean the inflow from the gin seas is more concentrated on the eurasian basin its effects may directly come to the partial pdf domain which is specified by the higher equivalent salinity s in the pdf box model as schematically shown in fig 17 the water flux rate is kept in the same way as the basic pdf box model without the separation determined from the density difference between the gin seas and the average over the entire arctic surface layer in addition to the gin seas inflow distributed to the higher salinity portion the low s inflow which contains both the pacific inflow and the river discharges through the shelf areas is separated from the forcing on the surface layer this pdf model setting corresponds to the simple box model in section 6 1 i e the unidirectional shift of pdf is determined by eq 6 1 the parameters q p t p s p and k s are common with those for the simple box model and the other parameter values are kept the same as the basic box model in section 2 the separation of the domain is controlled by limiting the direct inflow from the gin seas to higher s which is determined from the sum of pdf being 2 3 as shown in fig 17 the inflow is represented by the third terms in eq 6 1 along with an increase in the pdf over the portion receiving the gin seas water the low s inflow is given with the fourth terms in eq 6 1 and the pdf progression is assumed to have the following distributions i e the low s inflow increases the pdf at its grid t p s p as the gin seas inflow and the low s inflow tend to increase the pdf the outflow reduces the pdf at a uniform rate dp ij dt q s q p p ij in the entire domain under the constraint that the sum of all pdfs is kept at unity the horizontal mixing with the low s inflow grid takes place at the grids with lower s determined from the sum of pdf to be 2 3 where the mixing is formulated in the same way as that with the es 3 grid eq 3 5 the horizontal mixing with the es 3 grid is distributed over the grids with 2 3 of higher s hence the entire pdf domain is divided into three portions i e mainly the gin seas water on one third with higher s mainly the low s water on one third with lower s and mixture of both on the portion between the two extreme portions the arctic ocean has clear contrast between two parts the canadian basin and the eurasian basin fig 1b the pdf does not only represent the differences between the canadian basin and the eurasian basin but also retains the horizontal gradient in each of both basins as well as the heterogeneity associated with mesoscale variability and smaller scale features since the differences between both basins are directly induced by the effects of gin seas and the low s inflow the heterogeneity generation terms d t and d s are reduced to 1 4 of the basic pdf box model without the separation this setting is common as the one for the eurasian basin model in section 5 the horizontal mixing coefficients m 0 and m 1 are kept identical to those in the basic pdf box model in summary the parameter values in the reference case are d t 0 25 1 0 9 k2 s 1 d s 0 25 0 25 1 0 9 ppt2 s 1 m 0 1 0 6 s 1 m 1 1 0 6 s 1 t b t 0 s b s 0 0 4 ppt t a t 0 5 0 c s a s 0 20 0 ppt t s t 0 2 0 c s s s 0 0 3 ppt t p t 0 2 0 c s p s 0 2 2 ppt k t 2 10 8 s 1 k s 0 006 10 8 s 1 c s 1 0 10 8 kg 1 m3 s 1 q p 0 4 10 8 s 1 among these coefficients s b is varied in the case study for examination of the model sensitivity the additional case study is carried out for the variations in the pdf portion of the gin seas inflow and the pdf portions mixing with the low s inflow and the es 3 grid table 4 the pdf model domain is expanded toward the lower equivalent temperature by 1 c and salinity by 0 5 ppt so that the pdf may include almost all progressing processes in the domain the pdf box model is run for 40 years with the initial condition of t 0 c and s 33 7 ppt the case study was carried out with various equivalent salinity s b in the subsurface layer as shown in table 4 in the reference case 50 the solution follows the simple box model for a couple of years and then converges to the one near es 1 shifting a little toward es 3 fig 18 the pdf is separated between the high t s range and the low t s range showing the realistic effects of the atlantic water and the pacific water respectively these two cores suggest the high salinity area and the low salinity area in the eurasian and the canadian basins respectively showing some consistency with the pdf based on the observed data in fig 6 the convected portion is defined to be 25 5 along t times 5 along s grids with t b s b at the center and occupies 15 of the entire pdf in the reference case 50 table 4 since the low s inflow reaches the 1 3 portion with higher s solely due to horizontal mixing determined from eq 3 6 the convected portion is wider than the value in case 20 fig 8a the pdf distribution provides the pattern similar to the one derived from the climate data at 100 m depth in fig 6 except for the convected portion as s b is reduced to 34 2 in case 51 the total ratio of convected pdf portion increases to 21 fig 19 once s b is further reduced to 34 15 in case 52 the convected portion increases to 30 fig 20 even though the vertical stratification is changed the pacific water core shows a negligible change except for the pacific water core the pdf distribution features are similar between case 51 and case 22 fig 9a the pdf distribution near the es 3 grid is also similar between case 52 and case 43 of the eurasian basin model fig 15 the mean equivalent temperature is higher in case 52 by 0 2 c than in case 50 this difference corresponds to ice thickness of 0 5 m in the entire domain calculated from a 1 the sensitivity is examined in the separation of the inflows coming from the gin seas and also the pacific water plus the river discharges as the domain of the gin seas inflow is reduced to 1 3 of the pdf with higher s in case 61 the pdf is slightly concentrated toward es 3 fig 21 i e the convected portion becomes larger than that in the reference case by 5 table 4 thus the more concentrated gin seas inflow plays a role to enhance convection even when the mixing with the low s inflow is reduced to 1 3 of the pdf with lower s in case 62 the pdf distribution receives negligible effects fig 22 as the horizontal mixing with the es 3 grid is reduced to the grids with 1 3 of higher s in case 63 the convected portion is increased to 40 fig 23 table 4 thus it is proven that convection is weakened as long as the convected portion is mixed more widely with the other due to the gin seas water we recognize that the gin seas water is a crucial component to support convection while too wide mixing sometimes reduces convected portion 7 summary and discussion in summary a novel approach was proposed to examine the future states of an ocean area with small scale plumes due to convection using the probability distribution function pdf implemented in the simple box model the arctic ocean surface layer under the present warming trend was considered as an example the pdf defined on the t s plane retains the probabilities of water types but has the spatial distributions discarded the ice formation in the barents sea is decreasing and may reduce the density of the subsurface layer in the arctic ocean according to the basic pdf box model the arctic surface layer is at a salinity driven state exchanging its content with the more saline atlantic water in the greenland sea section 4 once the subsurface layer under the surface layer becomes less dense the surface layer could migrate toward a convected state with the subsurface layer the additional pdf box model of the eurasian basin shows the behavior consistent with the basic pdf box model but is much less sensitive to the heterogeneity generation than the basic one is section 5 as for the advanced pdf box models the inflow from the gin seas is distributed over the higher salinity area and then the low salinity water including the pacific water is supplied to a certain grid on the t s plane spreading over the lower salinity area section 6 the partial convection occurs in the higher salinity portion due to the reduction in the subsurface layer density in a consistent way with the eurasian basin model the sensitivity of convection to the subsurface layer density is a little weaker than the basic pdf box model the low salinity core is retained even though the higher salinity portion contains convection thus it is proposed to investigate whether the arctic surface layer will be partly convected and have significantly reduced sea ice in the near future the additional suggestion is to investigate carefully the individual components and mechanisms for their effects on the state shift such as a salinity decrease in the surface layer associated with less ice formation caused by the warming 7 1 possible future states in the arctic ocean on the basis of the case studies presented in sections 4 6 more detailed estimations are reported here about the reduction in the subsurface layer salinity this is because this trend may be the most crucial for the surface layer convection in the near future in addition other possible trends are discussed so that we may assess the future state in the arctic ocean ice formation in the barents sea has been decreasing in the last several decades walsh et al 2011 the review with a focus on the barents sea has been carried out by smedsrud et al 2013 i e the sea has important roles on heat flux from the atlantic ocean to the arctic ocean along with the oceanic effects on the atmospheric circulation in the present study the first order estimate was made as follows the barents sea over an area of 106 km2 has been covered with 1 m thick sea ice once this sea ice does not form the brine of 3 1013 ppt m3 would not be rejected in a year equivalently at a rate of 106 ppt m3 s 1 if this brine in the barents sea branch has mixed with the atlantic origin water in the fram strait branch which has a volume flux of 3 5 sv jones 2001 the cessation of the brine would reduce the salinity of the subsurface layer by 0 3 ppt thus once the ice formation is reduced by one third in the barents sea lien and trofimov 2013 the subsurface layer will have the salinity reduced by 0 1 ppt as presented in sections 5 and 6 a drastic change would occur in the surface layer of the eurasian basin due to 0 15 ppt reduction which could be produced by a half reduction in the ice formation in the barents sea the possible contribution estimated above seems significant although we have some additional factors to be examined lien and trofimov 2013 have reported distributions of the water types along the northern shelf break of the barents sea the water mass containing the brine tends to spread along the shelf break while its distribution is variable in time and space so that the denser part may sometimes flow down along the shelf break beyond the atlantic origin water layer arthun et al 2011 if the denser part completely sinks below the atlantic origin water it does not contribute to the increase in the subsurface layer density and hence its cessation would not cause a significant change in the vertical mixing between the surface and the subsurface layers it is necessary to estimate the ratio of the brine rejection which actually mixes within the atlantic origin water using observable information such as geochemical tracers as the other consequence of global warming sea ice melting over the entire arctic ocean gives freshwater to the surface layer this input could make the surface layer less saline along with weaker freshening in the subsurface layer if the vertical mixing is reduced between the surface and subsurface layers the subsurface layer might become warmer and more saline as a long term consequence the water exchange could be increased between the arctic and the atlantic oceans by reducing the density in the upper arctic ocean thus the subsurface layer would receive more atlantic water and become warmer and more saline the latter case has been suggested along the eurasian continental shelves polyakov et al 2010 2012 while it might become less influential after the cessation of a rapid sea ice melting for either case we should examine the sensitivity of the vertical mixing between the surface and subsurface layers more additional effects of the warming trend should be considered so that we may judge how feasible the shift toward the nearly convected state is one of the other possible trends would be accumulation of freshwater in the surface layer proshutinsky et al 2009 showed that the freshwater from the pacific ocean was increased and accumulated in the beaufort gyre in this century the main mechanism was suggested to be wind stresses which could increase the bering strait inflow and also concentrate the surface layer water toward the canada basin however careful observation is needed for the freshwater distribution in the entire arctic ocean this type of freshening could give a significant impact on the vertical mixing between the surface and subsurface layers although it is still an open question whether the wind stress trend would continue under future global warming the conclusion from the estimates made in this section suggests that the shift is possible from the non convected equilibrium state to the convected state under the warming trend however the individual components and mechanisms have to be investigated carefully for their effects on the state shift in essence the vertical stratification could be weakened over a certain criterion due to the realistic warming trend and hence we should make efforts to project the state shift to occur toward more active convection between the surface layer and the subsurface layer in the arctic ocean 7 2 model development direction from a modeling point of view the present research has provided a way to develop and use a three dimensional numerical model at some grids of which the pdfs are implemented by representing sub grid processes the first step will be to implement the pdf in a two box model with one box for the canadian basin and the other for the eurasian basin then the pdf will be implemented in a low resolution model without resolving mesoscale eddies it is suggested to include seasonal variability in the atmospheric forcing it is noted that the heterogeneity generation parameters d t and d s are mainly related with ocean current speeds as well as gradients of t and s between the concerned grid and the adjacent grids mesoscale features are the key players for both heterogeneity generation and horizontal mixing since eddy resolving models have been used widely and compared with observation data the pdf component can have the parameters d t d s m 0 and m 1 estimated appropriately the next application could be the implementation in an eddy resolving model which does not resolve a plume in a convective region in this case submesoscale features which were resolved in sasaki et al 2014 should be used to estimate d t d s m 0 and m 1 it is still difficult to run a plume resolving model for projection of basin scale circulation and hence the model results can be used to suggest the basic behavior of the high resolution models which resolve explicitly the heterogeneity represented by the pdf the advanced pdf box model has suggested in section 6 that when the active box faces both areas with higher and lower salinity it is useful to restrict the inflows over the pdf grids with higher and lower salinity respectively thus the same condition is recommended for a three dimensional model grids of which are located in a horizontal gradient of salinity it is noted that without this condition the convected area might expand or shrink too extensively within the concerned grid and then further influence neighboring grids continuously the new mechanism of pdf progression should be considered in the models having multiple grids implemented with pdf i e the pdf in a grid or box interacts with the pdfs in the adjacent grids or boxes the pdf pdf interactions have not been considered in the present study but should be crucial the most basic interaction may be related with advection between the grids being dependent on velocity fields in the case of interacting grids connected along the vertical direction the water densities associated with the pdfs may be the most crucial components for the pdf pdf interactions sea ice is the other component which has potential of producing interactions although it was simplified to be controlled by thermodynamic consequences of the water portion in the present study it is noted that sea ice is usually deformed due to dynamic processes such as ridging in addition the surface of sea ice is influenced by atmospheric heating and snow fall hence the sea ice model is supposed to be implemented with a pdf defined on a plane of thickness and albedo for the coupled ice ocean processes we would develop a pdf pdf interaction model thus more research is needed to contribute to the pdf modeling projects an additional suggestion would be to learn from the foregoing methods for development of an ocean circulation model implemented with the pdf one of them is the parameterization of water vapor at a sub grid scale of a weather forecast model proposed in tompkins 2002 and tompkins and berne 2008 they defined probability density functions to describe amounts of vapor cloud and others at each grid and examined the usefulness in the weather forecast models furthermore the lattice boltzmann method has been used for a turbulent flow on the basis of a traditional method to examine interactions among gas particles which control a probability of particles associated with each velocity vector chen and doolen 1998 the outcome of these modeling efforts may be useful for the modeling with the pdf defined on t and s also declaration of competing interest

support by japanese ministry of education culture sport science and technology was fundamental to this work innovative discussion with dr t toyoda was appreciated for deep consideration of the pdf model development appreciation is extended to fruitful discussion with the members in application laboratory japan agency for marine earth science and technology and dr t ikeda for editing the text with regard to the use of english appendix a the relationship of the equivalent temperature t and salinity s in the total ice water system is shown here with the actual liquid water temperature t w and salinity s w when the equivalent temperature at the sea surface t t o p 2 t t b is less than the freezing point t f the negative difference is converted to sea ice formation as a 1 c f ρ i ρ w h i 0 5 t f t t o p h 1 where h i is ice thickness m h 1 is the surface layer thickness 200m and c f 80 c is the ice heat of fusion divided by the specific heat of water heat capacity for 1 c ρ i is the ice density 0 9 103 kg m 3 and ρ w is the water density 1 103 kg m 3 the actual liquid water salinity s w is determined from the sum of equivalent salinity s and brine rejection this is expressed as salinity being conserved among the ice water system during ice formation and melting such that a 2 s w h 1 h i ρ i ρ w s i h i ρ i ρ w s h 1 where s i is the salinity of sea ice which is usually 5 ppt for new ice but kept as 0 ppt for simplicity in the present modeling the relationship between s w and t s is shown in fig a 1 while t w t for t 1 and t w 1 for t 1 appendix b the condition is examined for existence of the salinity driven state es 1 and the temperature driven state es 2 considering that sea ice does not affect essential behaviors of the thermohaline circulation the simpler equation set eq 2 1 is used here for the same reason vertical convection is omitted in eq 2 1 at the steady states t and s satisfy the following equations b 1a k t t a t q s t s t 0 b 1b k s s a s q s s s s 0 eq 2 2 and 2 4 have to be satisfied so that ρ and q s may be determined two solutions are determined from the cross points of the solid line and the dashed lines on the t s plane in fig b 1 the solid line satisfies eq b 1 with continuous values of q s q which are not determined from eq 2 4 but vary from 0 to infinity relevant to t s t a s a and t s s s respectively the character of the solid line is curvature toward the s axis caused by k t k s the solid line can be plotted with some value of t giving the value of q from eq b 2a and then the value of s s from eq b 2b b 2a q k t t a t t s t b 2b s k s s a q s s k s q the dashed lines are plotted on the basis of the dotted line which satisfies ρ ρ s where ρ is calculated from eq 2 2 the location t s of the dotted line is determined as b 3 β s α 0 α 1 t t ρ s by calculating the values of s with the values of t given crossing the point t s t s s s the locations t s and t s of the dashed lines are drawn relatively to the dotted line by setting common t values along with q values from eq b 2a s and s are determined from eq 2 4 b 4a β s β s q c s b 4b β s β s q c s therefore q s is equal to q on the dashed lines at the cross points between the solid line and the dashed lines eqs b 1a b 1b 2 2 and 2 4 are satisfied for the parameter values specified in this study the dashed line with s s does not cross the solid line therefore there is only one cross point with s s at which the active box has density lower than the external box the gin seas hence the cross point is categorized as es 1 salinity driven state since the dotted line shifts to smaller s caused by more contribution of temperature to density the number of the cross points is examined with the temperature range increased as t 0 is changed to 7 c so that t a and t s are increased by 7 c three cross points appear among these three cross points es 1 is the one with the smallest t and s while the point with the largest t and s is categorized as es 2 temperature driven state at which the active box has density higher than the external box the middle point es u is categorized as an unstable state to which a time dependent solution of eq 2 1 does not converge when t 0 is set to 7 c convergence occurs to es 1 with t 2 6 c s 32 6 ppt or es 2 with t 3 5 c s 33 7 ppt logically the stability is expressed with the signs of dt dt t and ds dt s if both gradients are negative the state is stable even if one of the gradients is positive the state is unstable from eq 2 1 without the convection terms the gradients are at es 1 b 5a t d t d t k t q s q s t t s t k

analytical solutions of eq b 1 with t 0 7 c is t s 2 63 32 58 which expresses a stable state with eq b 5 and is identified as es 1 two other solutions are t s 3 12 33 42 and t s 3 54 33 73 the substitution for all parameters in eq b 6 shows that the former is unstable and identified as es u while the latter is stable and identified as es 2 appendix c the steady solutions are analyzed with quantitative descriptions of the terms in eq 2 5 the relationships are also described among the equivalent temperature and salinity t and s with sea ice thickness h i and also the liquid water temperature and salinity t w and s w for the basic case of the simple box model es 1 has t 2 25 c at the mid depth and hence t t o p 4 5 c eq a 1 provides h i 1 25 200 80 0 9 3 125 0 9 3 472 m eq a 2 gives s w 33 27 200 200 3 125 33 80 the terms in eq 2 5 are evaluated from the solution at es 1 the air sea heat flux coefficient k t 0 419 10 8 s 1 calculated from eq 2 6 gives the first term to be 1 26 10 8 c s 1 in eq 2 5a here a negative value denotes a flux coming out of the surface layer thus the annual mean air sea heat flux is about 11 w m 2 on the basis of the surface layer thickness water density and specific heat of 4 2 103 j c 1 kg 1 the water density difference is 0 346 kg m 3 between the mid depth of the surface layer and the subsurface layer from eq 2 2 giving k b 0 098 10 8 s 1 from eq 2 3a hence the second term is 0 10 10 8 c s 1 and the annual mean flux of vertical mixing is less than 1 w m 2 the water density difference of 0 282 kg m 3 between the surface layer and the gin seas yields q s 0 282 10 8 s 1 from eq 2 4 and hence the third term becomes 1 20 10 8 c s 1 and about 10 w m 2 in eq 2 5a due to the inflow from the gin seas the first term in eq 2 5b is evaluated to be 0 372 10 8 ppt s 1 from k s 0 02 10 8 s 1 and the salinity difference between s a and s the second term is 0 049 10 8 ppt s 1 based on k b 0 098 10 8 s 1 and s b s w and the third term is 0 319 10 8 ppt s 1 based on q s 0 282 10 8 s 1 and s s s on the basis of the entire model domain to be 2000 km x 2000 km x 200 m the salinity flux from the first term is 3 0 106 ppt m3 s 1 and the third term provides 2 6 106 ppt m3 s 1 
23972,the 200 m thick surface layer of the arctic ocean contains a lower salinity part in the canadian basin receiving fresher water from the pacific ocean as well as rivers and also a higher salinity part in the eurasian basin receiving saltier water from the greenland sea this surface layer receives atmospheric forcing and also partially mixes with the subsurface layer thus thermohaline circulation is a fundamental pattern under the influences of mesoscale features 10 km and small scale plumes 1 km the one box model of the surface layer possesses a salinity driven state and also a convected state with the subsurface layer as another solution the new modeling is proposed with a probability distribution function pdf on the temperature salinity t s plane which can represent horizontal gradients and small scale features as well the t s distribution retains only the probabilities of different water types while their locations are discarded time progressions of the pdf are calculated with mechanisms of box mean progression heterogeneity generation horizontal mixing in the box and convection with the subsurface layer as either the subsurface layer becomes fresher or the heterogeneity is intensified the solution near the salinity driven state increases convection shifting toward the convected state the additional pdf box model is made for the eurasian basin which receives fresher water from the canadian basin instead of the pacific ocean and provides a more restricted solution with convection mainly controlled by the fresher subsurface layer the original pdf box model of the entire arctic ocean is extended to the wider horizontal variability case i e the inflow from the greenland sea is distributed over the higher salinity portion only and then the lower salinity water from the pacific ocean is supplied to a particular t s point t p s p mixing within the lower salinity portion only the low salinity core is retained near t p s p even though convection develops in the higher salinity portion thus this advanced pdf box model is a useful tool to judge a high resolution basin scale circulation model whether small scale plumes and mesoscale features play an important role on thermohaline circulation or not 1 introduction thermohaline ocean circulations are key components over the subtropical and subpolar regions by transporting sea water in the meridional directions in the north atlantic deep convection occurs by atmospheric cooling on warm and salty sea water which is carried by the atlantic meridional overturning circulation amoc the convection plays a role to supply a source for the global conveyer belt making important effects on the amoc the overturning circulation and vertical mixing interact with each other in the arctic ocean also up to now one of the highest resolution models was presented by hamman et al 2017 to study coastal flows from river discharges using 1 12 rotated sphere mesh thus it has not been carried out to resolve convective plumes with grids of 200 m width in the arctic ocean models as of yet hence it would be useful to provide a tool to expect behavior and to examine importance of plumes for basin scale circulations from this viewpoint we propose a model with a probability distribution function pdf implemented in a simple box model as an initial step plumes are produced in an area with vertical instability although static stability is a key mechanism for the vertical mixing it would not be simple to judge the stability of its field with horizontal variability related to mesoscale features and plumes it may be worthwhile to investigate how effective vertical mixing is prior to application of a high resolution model using the simple box model which is maintained by the probability distribution function pdf and has been applied to the meridional overturning in the north atlantic ocean ikeda 1997 the pdf on the temperature salinity t s plane is specified to retain only the probabilities of different water types while their locations are ignored since it could be questionable whether a box model is appropriate as the basic model a brief review is given here on the box model approach to study thermohaline circulation which was initiated by stommel 1961 the study took a simple box model to explore the dynamical principle of the global thermohaline circulation suggesting that there are two stable steady states along with one unstable state one steady state is driven by a density distribution due to temperature while the other is driven by a salinity induced density distribution however depending on the forcing terms there is only one steady state driven by salinity this pioneering work has been cited as the basis of regional thermohaline circulations by various authors rahmstorf et al 2005 compared a dozen numerical models either one or two stable states under the current atmospheric forcing by plotting hysteresis curves olbers and zhang 2008 compared ordinary box models with low order spectral models which could justify the box modeling approach with additional behavior such as a limit cycle in the latter case it is noted that these box modeling approaches including ikeda 1997 examined the role of the subpolar area on sensitivity of the thermohaline circulation with the subtropical area the sensitive state is caused by bimodality of the circulation i e a sudden freshening could switch the circulation from massive northward flow at the temperature driven state to delicate southward flow near the sea surface at the salinity driven state among such a main stream suggestion the pdf box model showed relative robustness of the present thermohaline circulation which exists essentially at the temperature driven state partly containing the convected state ikeda 1997 although the common mechanisms maintain the circulation in the arctic ocean and the gin greenland iceland and norwegian seas the present application focuses on sensitivity of vertical mixing in the surface subsurface layer of the arctic ocean which retains the lower density due to fresher water at the salinity driven state the thermohaline circulation in the arctic ocean and gin seas is now described as shown in fig 1 in the upper ocean above 500 m depth of the arctic ocean circulation is primarily driven by the buoyancy flux due to the low salinity water from the river discharges atmosphere and the pacific aagaard and carmack 1989 woodgate et al 2012 the surface layer above 200 m depth possesses the beaufort gyre and transpolar drift stream and exchanges sea water with the north atlantic through the fram strait and partly the barents sea the more saline atlantic water flows toward the canadian basin amerasian basin mainly in the subsurface layer around the depth of 200 to 500 m with some components entering into the surface layer and partly circulates back into the north atlantic rudels 2012 rudels et al 2015 it has been known that this water exchange is mainly caused by the density difference between the atlantic water and the less saline upper ocean the additional forcing is related to the density difference between the atlantic inflow and the heavier lower ocean below 500 m depth in the arctic ocean wind forcing contributes to the clockwise circulation in the surface layer of the canada basin although the wind driven component is more crucial for temporal variability as suggested by spall 2013 and ikeda 2014 the most remarkable change in the arctic sea ice cover is the reducing trend over the last 40 years or longer this trend is qualitatively consistent with the warming atmosphere but waits for a quantitative explanation walsh et al 2011 the ice cover in summer is predicted to become minimal near the end of the 21st century in the ipcc report however the observed ice decrease seems to be proceeding faster under a summer ice albedo feedback stroeve et al 2012 the atlantic water in the subsurface layer has relatively warmer and more saline characteristics in the arctic ocean while it receives a colder and more saline input from ice formation in the barents sea jones 2001 as the warming proceeds this input is weakened leaving the subsurface layer warmer and less saline than before lien and trofimov 2013 besides the barents sea branch sea ice cover has reduced to north of svalbard caused by the warmer fram strait branch onarheim et al 2014 this trend will induce the subsurface layer to be warmer and less saline than before for the investigation of vertical mixing in the arctic ocean the active box is set within the upper part of the arctic ocean which interacts with the gin seas in the present study a major issue is how easily the surface layer mixes with the subsurface layer in the case when the atlantic water with less salinity input is flowing into the arctic ocean through the barents sea hence the surface layer in the entire arctic ocean is set as an active box partly mixing with the subsurface layer which is set as a lower box the surface layer exchanges water with the gin seas as the additional model only the eurasian basin part with higher salinity is taken as an active box interacting with the lower salinity part in the canadian basin as well fig 1b since only the surface layer is chosen as the active box the interactions between the subsurface layer and the gin seas are not solved as part of the box model while the subsurface layer is prescribed as the component external to the active box it is noted that water temperature shows very minor contrast between the canadian and eurasian basins fig 1c the sea ice cover is thicker 3m in the canadian basin compared to 1 5m in the eurasian basin bourke and garrett 1987 the other issue to be considered is the role of a wind driven basin wide circulation which could modify the bimodality of thermohaline circulation guan and huang 2008 in the present study we consider that the wind driven component modifies the position of the major routes of water exchange between the arctic ocean and the gin seas but gives a minor effect on the mass transport of the density driven circulation ikeda 1987 as far as this effect has been examined on decadal variability using general circulation models along with observed data the exchange transport receives only a secondary effect e g ikeda 2014 first of all the simple box model is introduced for the surface layer of the arctic ocean which is forced with the atmosphere freshwater flux and other components and interacts with the gin seas in section 2 the pdf box model is explained in section 3 and then the model results are presented for the sensitivity of vertical mixing between the surface and subsurface layers in section 4 main foci are given on the reduction in the subsurface layer density and the effects of horizontal heterogeneity the active box is then limited to the eurasian basin part in section 5 for providing the behavior of the higher salinity part in the arctic ocean following these basic pdf box models the model is extended toward uneven distribution of the atlantic water and the pacific water inflows in section 6 it is shown how the sensitivities to the subsurface layer density and the horizontal heterogeneity are changed a summary is given in section 7 along with the salinity density reduction in the subsurface layer quantitatively estimated under the warming trend a suggestion is provided for application of the pdf to three dimensional numerical models 2 simple box model of the arctic ocean in the canadian and the eurasian basins 2 1 model description having the common concept with the subpolar model used in ikeda 1997 the simple box model is defined first as shown in fig 2 while the box model will be switched to the eurasian basin part in section 5 it is noted that various references were cited by ikeda 1997 within the upper ocean above 500 m depth of both canadian basin and eurasian basin the surface layer with 200 m thickness containing cold fresher water is set as a single active box which mainly has the pacific origin water coming through the bering strait this box receives atmospheric cooling hence sea ice formation negative salinity flux due to the river discharges precipitation minus evaporation and the pacific inflow these fluxes are combined and represent the atmospheric forcing term in the present model the subsurface layer underneath the surface layer is filled with the atlantic origin water from the gin seas through the fram strait with significant influences of the barents sea the surface layer flows out to the gin seas receiving the atlantic origin water which comes from the gin seas and circulates along the siberian continental slope the low salinity outflow through the canadian archipelago is included with the outflow through the fram strait the surface layer could also be convected with the subsurface layer depending on the density difference between these two layers it is noted that the wide continental shelf areas are not explicitly included in the surface layer box while the river discharges are considered to penetrate through the shelf areas into the surface layer temperature and salinity t and s are calculated from 2 1a d t d t k t t a t k b t b t q s t s t 2 1b d s d t k s s a s k b s b s q s s s s where t is time the subscripts a b and s denote atmosphere subsurface layer bottom box and gin seas southern box respectively the density variability retains the nonlinearity of t 2 2 ρ α 0 α 1 t t β s where α 0 0 046 kg m 3 k 1 α 1 0 012 kg m 3 k 2 and β 0 76 kg m 3 ppt 1 the vertical interaction coefficient was used by ikeda 1997 originally proposed by munk and anderson 1948 as 2 3a k b e ρ b ρ 1 5 for ρ b ρ ρ m 2 3b k b e ρ m 1 5 for ρ b ρ ρ m where e 2 10 10 kg 1 5 m 4 5 s 1 and ρ m 0 001 kg m 3 as the density difference falls below the lower limit ρ m the surface layer mixes with the subsurface layer within a few days water exchange with the gin seas occurs at a rate of 2 4 q s c s ρ s ρ where c s 1 0 10 8 kg 1 m3 s 1 in this study the reference values of temperature and salinity are taken from the typical ones in the upper ocean t 0 0 0 c and s 0 34 7 ppt the subsurface layer property is set on the basis of the average over the canadian basin and the eurasian basin by referring to jones 2001 polyakov et al 2010 and toole et al 2010 t b t 0 and s b s 0 0 4 ppt the atmospheric forcing terms are set as t a t 0 5 0 c s a s 0 20 0 ppt k t 2 10 8 s 1 and k s 0 02 10 8 s 1 giving time scales of thermal responses of a few years and salinity over a hundred years the crucial point is that the salinity force works more persistently than the thermal force does the effects of the gin seas are dependent on the density difference between the active box and the gin seas which have t s t 0 2 c and s s s 0 0 3 ppt the solutions are compared with observed data for verification of these parameters in this section in addition a sensitivity study is carried out to examine the effects of the parameters the water temperature and salinity are assumed to have linear profiles in the surface box as shown in fig 3 this assumption is reasonable in comparison with the observed profiles in the eurasian basin polyakov et al 2012 while it is still acceptable in the canadian basin proshutinsky et al 2009 the values at the bottom of the surface layer are set equal to those of the subsurface layer t b and s b the values at the mid depth are equal to the vertical averages and represent the surface layer temperature t and salinity s atmospheric cooling warming is calculated from the temperature at the sea surface t t o p 2 t t b as cooling is given to the sea surface t responds to atmospheric forcing once t t o p reaches the freezing point t f 2 c the negative difference is converted to sea ice formation here the temperature equivalent to the total heat in the ice water system is retained as t while the actual liquid water temperature is denoted as t w and its value at the sea surface is t w t o p the actual liquid water salinity s w is determined from the sum of equivalent salinity s and brine rejection see appendix a for the relationship among t s t w and s w and fig a 1 also it is noted that the surface layer acts as a whole even though the vertical profiles are set with linear gradients under these settings eq 2 1 is revised as 2 5a d t d t k t t a t w t o p k b t b t w q s t s t 2 5b d s d t k s s a s k b s b s w q s s s s where the atmospheric forcing on salinity is set to be calculated with s the vertical mixing effects are calculated from t w and s w as the actual liquid water only mixes with the subsurface layer the effects of water exchange with the gin seas are based on t and s under the assumption that the combined ice water system flows out here the water density is determined from t w and s w in eq 2 2 sea ice tends to prevent the air sea heat flux i e the heat flux is reduced with higher ice concentration and thickness then the air sea heat flux coefficient k t is expressed with ice thickness at the lowest order as 2 6 k t k t ex p ρ i ρ w h i h i e thus once ρ w h i e ρ i is assumed to be 2 m air sea heat flux with 3 m thick ice is estimated to be about 20 of the ice free state ice deformation and concentration are not explicitly included in the box model while the effects of open leads and ice ridges can be considered in this formulation i e the annual mean of 3 m thick ice may have about 30 of an ice free portion in fall when sea ice becomes thinner and sparser by averaging the seasonally variable ice thickness for one year the annual mean heat flux may be about 20 of the no ice state it is noted that the present model retains neither seasonal cycles nor synoptic variations and also neither ice movement nor deformation is explicitly resolved hence we should be concerned with the sea ice conditions thickness and air sea heat flux using the sea ice formulation with 2 6 under the air temperature of t a 5 0 c the model sensitivity is examined on the coefficient h i e in this section 2 2 results the simple box model is used to examine how the solutions converge in time from various initial conditions toward steady solutions as shown in fig 4 there are two steady solutions to which time dependent solutions converge during the time progressions for 10 years one of the steady solutions is the salinity driven one es 1 and the other is the convected one es 3 under the condition specified here the temperature driven state does not exist as shown in appendix b es 1 has the equivalent temperature t 2 25 c at the mid depth mean in the box and t t o p 4 5 c at the surface following eq a 1 ice thickness is h i 3 472 m and then the equivalent salinity s 33 27 derives the liquid water salinity s w 33 80 from eq a 2 as calculated in appendix c it is noted that the model sea ice is a little thicker than the observed one about 3m to 1 5 m bourke and garrett 1987 giving influence on higher water salinity than the data fig 1b es 3 has the state identical to the subsurface layer t t w 0 c and s s w 34 3 without sea ice the annual mean heat flux terms in eq 2 5a at es 1 are the air sea flux of 11 w m 2 the vertical mixing less than 1 w m 2 and the inflow from the gin seas of about 10 w m 2 as shown in appendix c it is noted that those three heat flux terms do not balance completely among themselves because the time dependent solutions are not exactly identical with es 1 in the period of 10 years once the model area is estimated as 2000 km 2000 km the surface layer volume is 8 1014 m3 and the volume transport between the surface layer and the gin seas is 2 3 106 m3 s 1 2 3 sv the salinity fluxes in eq 2 5b are evaluated to be 0 372 10 8 ppt s 1 from the atmosphere 0 049 10 8 ppt s 1 caused by vertical mixing and 0 319 10 8 ppt s 1 from the gin seas as shown in appendix c for the entire model domain the negative salinity flux from the first term is 3 0 106 ppt m3 s 1 and compared with the contribution by the river discharges precipitation minus evaporation and the pacific water inflow the third term is 2 6 106 ppt m3 s 1 as the water exchange through the fram strait including the barents sea the volume transport 2 3 sv between the surface layer and the gin seas is compared with the observed transport where the comparison is made at the lowest order schauer et al 2004 reported volume and heat transports across the zonal section near 80 n in the fram strait the northward flow of the atlantic water was identified with temperature higher than 1 c in the upper 500 m ocean their fig 2 and possessed an annual mean transport of about 4 sv the surface layer in the top 200 m occupies about half of this transport providing consistency with the present model result the negative salt flux which includes river discharges precipitation minus evaporation and also the inflow through the bering strait is 0 372 10 8 ppt s 1 and converted to the freshwater flux of 2 25 10 8 m s 1 on the layer with a thickness of 200 m and salinity of 33 ppt or the annual flux of 70 cm yr 1 according to aagaard and carmack 1989 river discharges are 35 cm yr 1 precipitation minus evaporation is 9 cm yr 1 and the inflow through the bering strait is 18 cm yr 1 it is noted that the present model does not represent the shelf areas explicitly in addition aagaard and carmack 1989 set the reference salinity at 34 8 ppt so that we may make a comparison only at the lowest order the more recent observations have shown an increase in the bering strait inflow after 2000 woodgate et al 2012 suggesting that careful projection is required for the future state in the arctic ocean sensitivity of the simple box model was examined by varying the model parameters as shown in table 1 in the ranges of year to year variability in the temperature and salinity values of the forcing terms the results are represented by sea ice thickness all cases have es 1 as steady states the atmosphere warmer by 0 5 c yields sea ice thinner by 0 6 m it is noted that this warming corresponds to the reduction in the air sea heat flux through the open water portion associated with the temperature difference between the freezing point and the air temperature from 3 c to 2 5 c the freshwater flux reduced by about a quarter results in 0 6 m thicker ice for which a smaller density difference with the gin seas reduces the water exchange and cools down the surface layer the gin seas box gives the surface layer qualitatively consistent effects i e the warmer gin seas tend to reduce ice thickness and the fresher gin seas reduce the water exchange with the surface layer and increase sea ice thickness the warmer subsurface layer also reduces sea ice thickness while the fresher one increases vertical mixing and reduces sea ice thickness it is noted that these model parameters are varied independently although the actual fields may vary with some relationship e g the subsurface layer directly receives influences from the gin seas these sensitivity tests suggest that the uncertainty in the forcing parameters induces only minor differences in the solutions the final case has the ice shielding twice as effective as the basic case halving sea ice thickness by keeping the atmospheric cooling nearly equal to that of the reference case as the pdf box model is examined quantitatively under the warming trend in section 4 5 and 6 more specific sensitivity results are presented the annual cycle was added by a sinusoidal fluctuation in the air temperature with an amplitude of 10 c although the solutions are not presented here the solutions converge to es 1 with fluctuations in the mid depth equivalent temperature with amplitudes of about 0 1 c which corresponds to ice thickness of 0 3 m however there is no significant impact on the annual mean states main results of the box model are summarized in the surface layer of the arctic ocean two steady states are the salinity driven state and the convected state while no temperature driven state appears sea ice is effective to shield the sea surface from atmospheric cooling and also to determine the salinity distribution 3 basic pdf box model of the arctic ocean in the canadian and the eurasian basins the method of the probability distribution function pdf was initially proposed in ikeda 1997 which fully described the formulation and can be referred to for details hence the concept is described here along with the necessary equations for solving the present problem although the box model is used in the present study to examine responses of the arctic ocean without resolving horizontal variability it may be useful to examine roles of the variability the real arctic ocean contains spatial variability caused by atmospheric forcing e g synoptic low pressure systems since a box model covers the entire arctic ocean horizontal variability includes spatial gradients of water properties also e g the contrast between the canadian and the eurasian basins fig 1b the sea ice cover which contains pack ice ice ridges and open leads yields horizontal variability with sizes from a kilometer to hundreds the combination of wind stresses and the ice cover causes wind driven ice edge upwelling as typical variability in the ocean mesoscale eddies and plumes are usual features in the arctic ocean using the pdf defined on the t s plane the evolution of horizontal variability is tracked where external forcing and internal mixing are parameterized thus instead of a high resolution model spatial heterogeneity is considered while the positions of spatially heterogeneous features are discarded the pdf is defined at discrete grids i j on the t s plane p p i j at t i s j t r e f s r e f i δ t j δ s with t r e f s r e f to be reference values as shown in fig 5a the sum of p i j is 1 the grid size is chosen as δ t δ s 0 1 0 05 the mean values in the box model are expressed as 3 1 t s t r e f s r e f i j p i j t i p i j s j four types of evolution of p i j are shown in fig 5b i e unidirectional shift caused by external forcing heterogeneity generation due to external and internal forcing convergence related to horizontal mixing and shift toward the subsurface layer values due to convection it is noted that some internal processes redistribute horizontal variability e g mesoscale instability separates fronts into eddies plumes often develop under ice formation even in the fields with gentle horizontal gradients the unidirectional shift is first formulated and estimated the time derivatives dt dt ij and ds dt ij dt dt and ds dt at the grid point i j are related with the external forcing as specified by eq 2 5a and 2 5b the terms t t w t w t o p s and s w are replaced with the values at the grid point i j 3 2a d p i j d t p i j d t d t i j δ t d s d t i j δ s 3 2b d p i n j d t p i j d t d t i j δ t n 1 f o

over the t s grids as shown in the appendix of ikeda 1997 this formulation expresses the effects of the external forcing on the grid points in the particular ways e g the uniform forcing of atmosphere and the uniform volume of the gin seas inflow the modulated formulations are introduced for the advanced pdf model in section 6 such as the gin seas inflow concentrated on the higher salinity grid points the heterogeneity generation is represented by conversion from a higher to lower value of pdf between each set of adjacent grids 3 3a d p i j d t d p i 1 j d t d t p i 1 j p i j δ t δ t 3 3b d p i j d t d p i j 1 d t d s p i j 1 p i j δ s δ s this finite difference form is equivalent to the differential form 3 4 p t d t 2 p t 2 d s 2 p s 2 as seen in the appendix of ikeda 1997 the coefficients d t and d s are estimated based on the fluxes of the atmospheric forcing freshwater flux and water inflow from the external seas the box model receives the heat flux of 10 8 k s 1 and the salt flux of 0 5 10 8 ppt s 1 section 2 once the pdf expands over 1 k along the t axis the coefficient of d t 10 9 k2 s 1 corresponds to a temporal variability of 10 9 s 1 this scale is 10 of the box mean state and may be reasonable as the forcing to produce the horizontal variability the pdf over 0 5 ppt along the s axis can be supported by the coefficient of d s 0 25 10 9 ppt2 s 1 giving also the scale 10 of the mean state these coefficient values are chosen as references and examined in the sensitivity study section 4 horizontal mixing within the surface layer box is formulated by convergence of the pdf from two grids toward the mid point grid between the two in the t s plane for this internal mixing the same amounts of two water types are transferred to the mid point as categorized in two cases case 1 the convected es 3 grid at i j and the non convected portion at i j 3 5 d p i j d t 2 d p i j d t 2 d p i j d t m 0 p i j p i j f o r i i j j 2 i 2 j limited to those with the mid points matching the grid points the water distribution is assumed that the convected blobs are well dispersed over the surface layer while i j is often far from the main group on the pdf plane this assumption for the basic pdf model will be modified so that the mixing is limited to a higher salinity region for the advanced pdf model in section 6 case 2 among the non convected portion 3 6 d p i j d t 2 d p i m j n d t m 1 p i m j n p i m j n f o r m n 1 1 1 0 0 1 1 1 limited to four sets between eight adjacent grid points around i j representing the mixing with the other water components similar to the one concerned on the assumption that the water properties vary gradually in space except for the convected portion this mixing formulation may represent horizontal mixing well horizontal mixing is induced by ocean currents and eddies along with waves such as internal gravity waves the mixing rate is evaluated with velocity horizontal length scale 0 1 ms 1 100 km 1 0 6 s 1 it is noted that the external forcing produces artificial heterogeneity numerical instability under the numerical format as shown by eq 3 2 therefore the mixing should cancel the artificial effects it is an open question how wide the mixing domain is on the t s plane among the non convected portion case 2 if the mixing takes place within the domain of 5 grid points of temperature and salinity each almost dozen pairs of grid points should be included and summed for the formula this state is represented by four pairs only with m n 1 0 0 1 1 1 and 1 1 and then the coefficient m 1 may be increased about several times on the other hand horizontal mixing may be weaker in the non convected regions than around the convected points this sensitivity is examined with the case study in section 4 caused by convection with the subsurface layer p i j is converted to p i j for a density difference smaller than 3 ρ m where ρ m 0 001 kg m 3 once convection occurs it is assumed that vertical mixing continues within one time step 1 day here until it reaches complete mixture after ice melting a test case with the mixing spreading for 100 days gives a common tendency with the 1 day case it is assumed that plumes exist all over the model domain and are equally mixed with the other water masses in section 4 in section 6 however the model is examined under the horizontal mixing with the convected portion limited to a certain water type e g the mixing takes place only with the portion of higher salinity or density the pdf proceeds in time through eq 3 2 3 3 3 5 and 3 6 with an initial condition concentrated at one grid on the t s plane only in a test case an initial condition is set with two grids of different water types since the cores expand within a relatively short time a few years the solutions are not sensitive to the initial pdf distribution as shown in section 4 the time step is chosen to be 1 day the schematic pdf of the observed t and s is produced for verification of the model results in fig 6 it is noted that the equivalent temperature t and salinity s in the total ice water system are calculated with the actual liquid water temperature t w in fig 1 c and salinity s w in fig 1 b along with sea ice thickness h i as shown in appendix a the representative h i is 3 m in the canadian basin and 1 5 m in the eurasian basin bourke and garrett 1987 sea ice formed at the sea surface contributes to a decrease in t relative to the observed t w as expressed by 3 7 c f ρ i ρ w h i t w t h 1 this relationship is consistent with eq a 1 for the model using the information provided in section 2 and eq a 2 also the equivalent temperature and salinity are calculated from the liquid water temperature and salinity t w s w 1 5 32 5 in the canadian basin and 1 5 34 0 in the eurasian basin i e t s 2 6 32 1 and 2 0 33 8 in the canadian and eurasian basins respectively once the ice thickness increases to 15 m in 10 of the canadian basin due to ridging t s can be modified to be 3 1 31 9 the pdf has two peaks on the lower and the higher s corresponding to the canadian basin and the eurasian basin respectively as shown in fig 6 4 basic pdf box model results of the arctic ocean in the canadian and eurasian basins 4 1 basic model behavior the model is run for 40 years with the initial condition of t 0 and several s values around s 34 0 all cases are listed on table 2 with varying values for s b d t d s m 1 and m 0 the standard case 20 is investigated in this subsection while the probability model is examined first without the heterogeneity generation d t d s 0 in case 30 in comparison with the simple box model as shown in fig 7 the solution closely converges to es 1 from t s 0 33 7 i e the solution exactly matches with the simple box model the pdf is distributed mainly concentrated over about dozen grids around the mean t s values although the external forcing produces artificial heterogeneity due to the numerical scheme eq 3 2 the mixing tends to stabilize the artificial effects for the standard case in fig 8a the solution progressively approaches es 1 the pdf spreads having the core part with widths of 1 5 along the t axis and 1 2 along the s axis starting with different initial conditions of s in fig 8b the solutions converge to either one near es 1 or the other near es 3 from the initial condition at es 3 the solution shifts toward es 1 with the s value being smaller than es 3 by 0 1 from s 33 9 the solution initially moves toward es 1 and then changes direction in a couple of years around t s 1 6 33 8 toward es 3 thus the heterogeneity tends to spread the pdf allowing a small component to convect with the subsurface layer and then horizontal mixing between the es 3 grid and the other part pulls the solution toward es 3 as the solution converges to es 3 the pdf at the subsurface layer value t s 0 0 34 3 occupies about 30 here let us look at the boundary which separates the region converging toward es 3 and the region toward es 1 the boundary exists in the vicinity of es 3 at around s 34 2 using the simple box model fig 4 i e no progression occurs from the direction toward es 1 to the opposite side toward es 3 in the standard case of the probability model the boundary exists at around s 33 8 as sea ice grows due to cooling the water salinity increases to s w 34 1 around the turning point t s 1 6 33 8 it is noted that the difference between s and s w matches with the formulation shown in fig a 1 i e s w s s is 0 01 at t 1 6 thus the salinity difference reduces to 0 2 between the surface layer and the subsurface layer enhancing the shift toward es 3 it is remarked that once the mean property exceeds the boundary toward es 3 it will never come back to the other side for the cases shown above the initial pdf is concentrated on one grid while the initial state with two pdf components is examined i e 0 75 at t s 0 33 5 and 0 25 at t s 0 34 3 the t s evolution is very similar to the one with a single pdf component of unity at t s 0 33 7 no figure shown thus the solution is not sensitive to an initial state with a minor pdf component at the es 3 grid 4 2 vertical mixing caused by reduction in the subsurface layer salinity in response to ice formation reduction in the barents sea the atlantic origin water in the subsurface layer tends to receive less brine rejection and then reduces its salinity in case 22 when s b and hence the bottom boundary condition of the surface layer are changed to 34 2 the solution starting from t s 0 0 33 7 converges to the asymptotic solution in the vicinity of es 3 fig 9a from various initial conditions of s between 33 2 and 34 2 only one equilibrium exists near es 3 fig 9b around the turning point t s 2 1 33 4 the water salinity s w 33 8 seems close enough to s b so that the solution may move toward es 3 although s b s w is around 0 4 the turning point is close to es 1 because the external forcing may be too weak to pull the solution toward es 1 the pdf of the equilibrium solution has a peak at es 3 along with a ridge around t s of the solution fig 9a a balance has been achieved between the heterogeneity generation and the mixing of the convected portion near es 3 with the others the heterogeneity generation tends to disperse the pdf among which the portion in the smaller t and s area is pulled toward es 1 due to the external forcing and also mixes with the convected portion as a result the pdf stays around the ridge case 21 is set with s b 34 25 in between cases 20 and 22 without a figure the regression becomes extremely slow near es 1 keeping one equilibrium solution in the vicinity of s 33 5 and the other equilibrium exists near es 3 the turning point exists around t s 2 0 33 6 from these three cases it can be claimed that the equilibrium states are very sensitive to the value of s b the important statement from these three cases is that as the subsurface salinity comes close to the surface salinity gradual progression occurs from the equilibrium near es 1 to the other near es 3 even if s b increases again no return occurs to the equilibrium near es 1 4 3 model sensitivity to heterogeneity generation and horizontal mixing as the heterogeneity generation is doubled in case 33 the solution starting from t s 0 33 7 converges to es 3 fig 10a the progressions from various initial s values converge toward es 3 without any convergence toward es 1 fig 10b the asymptotic solution departs slightly more from es 3 compared with the one in case 20 fig 8b i e the distance is increased by the heterogeneity strength in cases 31 and 32 when only one of d t and d s is doubled respectively the solutions have basically the same but slightly weaker tendency toward es 3 than case 33 no figure shown in case 33 the boundary between the region toward es 3 and the region toward es 1 shifts to t s 2 0 33 5 or a smaller s than case 20 as sea ice formation increases the water salinity to s w 33 9 around the turning point t s 2 0 33 5 the salinity difference becomes 0 4 between the surface layer and the subsurface layer thus the stronger heterogeneity generation allows the wider convergence toward es 3 in section 4 2 it has been shown that the subsurface salinity s b reduced to 34 2 supports the solution to converge toward es 3 fig 9a the sensitivity of the convergence is examined for the horizontal mixing coefficients m 1 and m 0 in case 34 with m 1 reduced by a factor of 0 5 the solution shows negligible differences from case 22 no figure shown thus the solutions are insensitive to the mixing within the non convected portion in case 35 when the mixing with the es 3 grid m 0 is reduced by a factor of 0 5 the solution shows weaker convergence toward es 3 with a longer ridge toward es 1 fig 11 than case 22 fig 9a the case study has confirmed that m 0 is more influential on the convergence toward es 3 than m 1 by mixing the non convected portion with the es 3 grid and pulling the pdf toward es 3 it is noted that the sensitivity to the mixing parameters is shown for the cases when horizontal mixing is assumed to take place between the es 3 grid and all other t s grids in this section the sensitivity is further examined in section 6 for more realistic cases of the arctic ocean under the horizontal mixing limited to certain water types 5 box model of the eurasian basin 5 1 simple box model the arctic ocean surface layer shows the clear contrast of water salinity in the climate data fig 1b i e salinity is around 32 5 ppt in the canadian basin while it is 34 0 34 5 ppt in the eurasian basin the high salinity water flows into the eurasian basin from the gin seas and the low salinity water in the canadian basin mixes with the eurasian basin the vertical structure is set common as the basic model in section 2 fig 2 divided into the surface subsurface and lower layers convection with the subsurface layer tends to occur more easily in the higher salinity part hence the eurasian basin is taken as an active box and shown in fig 12 the governing equations are similar to those of the basic model in section 2 and hence the differences only are described the equations to calculate temperature and salinity t and s are modified from eq 2 5 to 5 1a d t d t k t t a t w t o p k b t b t w q s t s t q c t c t 5 1b d s d t k s s a s k b s b s w q s s s s q c s c s where the subscripts a b s and c denote atmosphere subsurface layer bottom box gin seas southern box and the canadian basin respectively the actual liquid water temperature is denoted as t w with t w t o p at the sea surface and the actual liquid water salinity is s w the density is calculated from t w and s w using eq 2 2 and the vertical interaction coefficient is determined from eq 2 3 water exchange with the gin seas is induced at a rate of 5 2a q s c s ρ s ρ ρ c 2 where c s 2 0 10 8 kg 1 m3 s 1 this formula reflects that the transport is determined from a density difference between the gin seas and the average in the arctic ocean where the eurasian basin is set to have the same horizontal size as the canadian basin the coefficient c s is twice as large as that in section 2 based on the assumption that the inflow from the gin seas spreads over the eurasian basin whose area is a half of the arctic ocean water exchange with the canadian basin occurs at a rate of 5 2b q c c c ρ c ρ where c c 0 5 10 8 kg 1 m3 s 1 the water exchange takes place due to eddy induced mixing across the transpolar drift stream and may be less efficient than the exchange between the arctic ocean and the gin seas the water property in the canadian basin is set as t c t 0 3 c and s c s 0 2 2 ppt since the eurasian basin receives less freshwater than the entire arctic ocean does the freshwater flux is reduced to a half k s 0 01 10 8 s 1 the other model parameters are common with the basic simple box model in section 2 i e t a t 0 5 0 c s a s 0 20 0 ppt k t 2 10 8 s 1 t s t 0 2 c and s s s 0 0 3 ppt the effects of water exchange with the canadian basin and the gin seas are based on t and s under the assumption that the combined ice water system flows in and out the solutions are compared with observed data for verification of these parameters in this section the solutions shown in fig 13 are consistent with those of the basic model in section 2 there are two steady solutions the salinity driven one es 1 and the convected one es 3 es 1 has the equivalent temperature t 1 66 c at the mid depth and t t o p 3 3 c at the surface following eq a 1 ice thickness is h i 1 833 m the equivalent salinity is s 33 78 and the liquid water salinity is s w 34 06 from eq a 2 thus the average of the eurasian basin and the canadian basin is t s 2 33 33 14 and very close to the one in section 2 es 3 has the state identical to the subsurface layer t t w 0 c and s s w 34 3 without sea ice 5 2 pdf box model the pdf box model of the eurasian basin is set similar to that of the entire arctic ocean section 3 the unidirectional shift reflects the replacement of eq 2 5 with eq 5 1 for the simple box model to which the parameters are matched most of the parameter values in the pdf box model are common with the basic pdf model in section 3 except for the heterogeneity generation terms d t and d s in section 3 the pdf represents the contrast between the canadian and the eurasian basins in addition to the gradients within each basin as well as mesoscale eddies and plumes for the eurasian basin model the contrast between the two basins should be excluded based on the overview of t s distributions in the arctic ocean and the eurasian basin the distribution size of the latter is estimated to be about a half of the former one fig 1b hence d t and d s of the eurasian basin are reduced by a factor of 0 25 from those of the entire arctic ocean i e d t 0 25 10 9 k2 s 1 and d s 0 25 0 25 10 9 ppt2 s 1 the model sensitivity is examined to these two parameters here the model is run for 40 years starting with t s 0 0 33 7 the subsurface salinity s b is varied for four cases listed in table 3 in case 40 with s b 34 3 the solution converges to es 1 in a consistent way with the simple box model fig 14 the pdf distribution is concentrated around es 1 as s b reduces the solutions tend to move toward es 3 in case 43 with s b 34 15 the solution approaches es 3 fig 15 while the tendency is less drastic than the basic pdf model section 4 i e the solution approaches es 3 with s b 34 2 in case 22 fig 9a the model sensitivity to the heterogeneity generation terms is examined by increasing d t and d s by a factor of two in case 44 the model progression and the pdf distribution are similar to those in case 40 no figure shown thus the pdf model becomes more robust to horizontal heterogeneity in the box model of the eurasian basin separated from the canadian basin the results of the eurasian basin model are used to verify the pdf model extended toward uneven distribution of the atlantic water and the pacific water inflows in section 6 6 separation of water inflows in the pdf box model of the arctic ocean in the canadian and the eurasian basins in the study presented to this point the active box contains horizontal variability without any information of geographical locations it is noted that the arctic ocean surface layer contains two groups of salinity values in the climate data fig 1b i e higher salinity in the eurasian basin and lower salinity in the canadian basin under the consideration of more realistic situations in the arctic ocean it is useful to examine how the pdf box model behaves with uneven distributions of the atlantic water and pacific water inflows convection tends to occur more easily in the region with a higher ratio of the atlantic water the simple box model is first examined in section 6 1 with the pacific inflow separated from the atmospheric forcing here some of the river discharges are treated to be combined with the pacific inflow next the pdf box model is examined in section 6 2 where the atlantic water from the gin seas is distributed to some restricted portion of the pdf domain which is chosen on the basis of salinity the pdf box model is also modified with the pacific inflow into a single pdf grid mixing with the restricted pdf domain near by the pacific inflow grid 6 1 separation of freshwater flux in the simple box model in this section the pacific inflow and the river discharges are categorized as low s inflow and separated from precipitation minus evaporation since the pacific inflow stays in the canadian basin for long time and partly spreads toward the eurasian basin some portion of the pacific water directly flows out toward the gin seas and also through the canadian archipelago the river discharges penetrate through the shelf areas into the surface layer of the canadian basin the uneven distribution may have a significant impact on the vertical convection and should be considered in the pdf model while the simple box model is first used to examine the solutions such as es 1 the governing equations 2 5 for t and s are modified with additional terms 6 1a d t d t k t t a t w t o p k b t b t w q s t s t q p t p t 6 1b d s d t k s s a s k b s b s w q s s s s q p s p s where subscript p denotes the low s inflow a main effect is on the salinity flux although the heat flux term is also separated to maintain consistency the horizontal mixing of the low s inflow with the surrounding water takes place in prior to the spreading over the canadian basin it is crucial for the pdf model that the product of this mixing appears within a reasonable pdf domain size providing the source water for the low salinity component in the canadian basin the inflow is given a rate of q p 0 4 10 8 s 1 with t p t 0 2 0 c and s p s 0 2 2 ppt among the terms estimated as atmospheric forcing in section 2 2 precipitation minus evaporation is minor compared with the bering strait inflow and the river discharges hence only k s is reduced by 70 to be 0 006 10 8 s 1 from the basic box model while the others are not changed i e t a t 0 5 0 c s a s 0 20 0 ppt and k t 2 10 8 s 1 the solutions are compared with those in the basic case when the low s inflow is combined with the atmospheric forcing in section 2 in fig 16 the progressions are extremely similar to those of the basic case in fig 4 i e there are two equilibrium states es 1 and es 3 es 1 has the equivalent temperature t 2 16 c and the equivalent salinity s 33 26 ppt the first term in eq 6 1b is evaluated to be 0 111 10 8 ppt s 1 from k s 0 006 10 8 s 1 and the salinity difference between s a and s the fourth term is 0 304 10 8 ppt s 1 based on q p 0 4 10 8 s 1 and s p s the sum of these two terms 0 415 10 8 ppt s 1 has a little 10 larger magnitude than the term 0 372 10 8 ppt s 1 defined as the atmospheric forcing for the basic model in section 2 it is noted that the actual transport is maintained by the pacific inflow through the bering strait as well as water exchange with the shelf areas the net southward flow through the fram strait plays a role to take a balance of water mass in the arctic ocean although the outflows are combined into the water exchange with the gin seas in the present model the net inflow can be taken out by the transport through the canadian archipelago in the real field as well 6 2 separation of the atlantic and the pacific inflows in the pdf box model in the surface layer of the arctic ocean the inflow from the gin seas is more concentrated on the eurasian basin its effects may directly come to the partial pdf domain which is specified by the higher equivalent salinity s in the pdf box model as schematically shown in fig 17 the water flux rate is kept in the same way as the basic pdf box model without the separation determined from the density difference between the gin seas and the average over the entire arctic surface layer in addition to the gin seas inflow distributed to the higher salinity portion the low s inflow which contains both the pacific inflow and the river discharges through the shelf areas is separated from the forcing on the surface layer this pdf model setting corresponds to the simple box model in section 6 1 i e the unidirectional shift of pdf is determined by eq 6 1 the parameters q p t p s p and k s are common with those for the simple box model and the other parameter values are kept the same as the basic box model in section 2 the separation of the domain is controlled by limiting the direct inflow from the gin seas to higher s which is determined from the sum of pdf being 2 3 as shown in fig 17 the inflow is represented by the third terms in eq 6 1 along with an increase in the pdf over the portion receiving the gin seas water the low s inflow is given with the fourth terms in eq 6 1 and the pdf progression is assumed to have the following distributions i e the low s inflow increases the pdf at its grid t p s p as the gin seas inflow and the low s inflow tend to increase the pdf the outflow reduces the pdf at a uniform rate dp ij dt q s q p p ij in the entire domain under the constraint that the sum of all pdfs is kept at unity the horizontal mixing with the low s inflow grid takes place at the grids with lower s determined from the sum of pdf to be 2 3 where the mixing is formulated in the same way as that with the es 3 grid eq 3 5 the horizontal mixing with the es 3 grid is distributed over the grids with 2 3 of higher s hence the entire pdf domain is divided into three portions i e mainly the gin seas water on one third with higher s mainly the low s water on one third with lower s and mixture of both on the portion between the two extreme portions the arctic ocean has clear contrast between two parts the canadian basin and the eurasian basin fig 1b the pdf does not only represent the differences between the canadian basin and the eurasian basin but also retains the horizontal gradient in each of both basins as well as the heterogeneity associated with mesoscale variability and smaller scale features since the differences between both basins are directly induced by the effects of gin seas and the low s inflow the heterogeneity generation terms d t and d s are reduced to 1 4 of the basic pdf box model without the separation this setting is common as the one for the eurasian basin model in section 5 the horizontal mixing coefficients m 0 and m 1 are kept identical to those in the basic pdf box model in summary the parameter values in the reference case are d t 0 25 1 0 9 k2 s 1 d s 0 25 0 25 1 0 9 ppt2 s 1 m 0 1 0 6 s 1 m 1 1 0 6 s 1 t b t 0 s b s 0 0 4 ppt t a t 0 5 0 c s a s 0 20 0 ppt t s t 0 2 0 c s s s 0 0 3 ppt t p t 0 2 0 c s p s 0 2 2 ppt k t 2 10 8 s 1 k s 0 006 10 8 s 1 c s 1 0 10 8 kg 1 m3 s 1 q p 0 4 10 8 s 1 among these coefficients s b is varied in the case study for examination of the model sensitivity the additional case study is carried out for the variations in the pdf portion of the gin seas inflow and the pdf portions mixing with the low s inflow and the es 3 grid table 4 the pdf model domain is expanded toward the lower equivalent temperature by 1 c and salinity by 0 5 ppt so that the pdf may include almost all progressing processes in the domain the pdf box model is run for 40 years with the initial condition of t 0 c and s 33 7 ppt the case study was carried out with various equivalent salinity s b in the subsurface layer as shown in table 4 in the reference case 50 the solution follows the simple box model for a couple of years and then converges to the one near es 1 shifting a little toward es 3 fig 18 the pdf is separated between the high t s range and the low t s range showing the realistic effects of the atlantic water and the pacific water respectively these two cores suggest the high salinity area and the low salinity area in the eurasian and the canadian basins respectively showing some consistency with the pdf based on the observed data in fig 6 the convected portion is defined to be 25 5 along t times 5 along s grids with t b s b at the center and occupies 15 of the entire pdf in the reference case 50 table 4 since the low s inflow reaches the 1 3 portion with higher s solely due to horizontal mixing determined from eq 3 6 the convected portion is wider than the value in case 20 fig 8a the pdf distribution provides the pattern similar to the one derived from the climate data at 100 m depth in fig 6 except for the convected portion as s b is reduced to 34 2 in case 51 the total ratio of convected pdf portion increases to 21 fig 19 once s b is further reduced to 34 15 in case 52 the convected portion increases to 30 fig 20 even though the vertical stratification is changed the pacific water core shows a negligible change except for the pacific water core the pdf distribution features are similar between case 51 and case 22 fig 9a the pdf distribution near the es 3 grid is also similar between case 52 and case 43 of the eurasian basin model fig 15 the mean equivalent temperature is higher in case 52 by 0 2 c than in case 50 this difference corresponds to ice thickness of 0 5 m in the entire domain calculated from a 1 the sensitivity is examined in the separation of the inflows coming from the gin seas and also the pacific water plus the river discharges as the domain of the gin seas inflow is reduced to 1 3 of the pdf with higher s in case 61 the pdf is slightly concentrated toward es 3 fig 21 i e the convected portion becomes larger than that in the reference case by 5 table 4 thus the more concentrated gin seas inflow plays a role to enhance convection even when the mixing with the low s inflow is reduced to 1 3 of the pdf with lower s in case 62 the pdf distribution receives negligible effects fig 22 as the horizontal mixing with the es 3 grid is reduced to the grids with 1 3 of higher s in case 63 the convected portion is increased to 40 fig 23 table 4 thus it is proven that convection is weakened as long as the convected portion is mixed more widely with the other due to the gin seas water we recognize that the gin seas water is a crucial component to support convection while too wide mixing sometimes reduces convected portion 7 summary and discussion in summary a novel approach was proposed to examine the future states of an ocean area with small scale plumes due to convection using the probability distribution function pdf implemented in the simple box model the arctic ocean surface layer under the present warming trend was considered as an example the pdf defined on the t s plane retains the probabilities of water types but has the spatial distributions discarded the ice formation in the barents sea is decreasing and may reduce the density of the subsurface layer in the arctic ocean according to the basic pdf box model the arctic surface layer is at a salinity driven state exchanging its content with the more saline atlantic water in the greenland sea section 4 once the subsurface layer under the surface layer becomes less dense the surface layer could migrate toward a convected state with the subsurface layer the additional pdf box model of the eurasian basin shows the behavior consistent with the basic pdf box model but is much less sensitive to the heterogeneity generation than the basic one is section 5 as for the advanced pdf box models the inflow from the gin seas is distributed over the higher salinity area and then the low salinity water including the pacific water is supplied to a certain grid on the t s plane spreading over the lower salinity area section 6 the partial convection occurs in the higher salinity portion due to the reduction in the subsurface layer density in a consistent way with the eurasian basin model the sensitivity of convection to the subsurface layer density is a little weaker than the basic pdf box model the low salinity core is retained even though the higher salinity portion contains convection thus it is proposed to investigate whether the arctic surface layer will be partly convected and have significantly reduced sea ice in the near future the additional suggestion is to investigate carefully the individual components and mechanisms for their effects on the state shift such as a salinity decrease in the surface layer associated with less ice formation caused by the warming 7 1 possible future states in the arctic ocean on the basis of the case studies presented in sections 4 6 more detailed estimations are reported here about the reduction in the subsurface layer salinity this is because this trend may be the most crucial for the surface layer convection in the near future in addition other possible trends are discussed so that we may assess the future state in the arctic ocean ice formation in the barents sea has been decreasing in the last several decades walsh et al 2011 the review with a focus on the barents sea has been carried out by smedsrud et al 2013 i e the sea has important roles on heat flux from the atlantic ocean to the arctic ocean along with the oceanic effects on the atmospheric circulation in the present study the first order estimate was made as follows the barents sea over an area of 106 km2 has been covered with 1 m thick sea ice once this sea ice does not form the brine of 3 1013 ppt m3 would not be rejected in a year equivalently at a rate of 106 ppt m3 s 1 if this brine in the barents sea branch has mixed with the atlantic origin water in the fram strait branch which has a volume flux of 3 5 sv jones 2001 the cessation of the brine would reduce the salinity of the subsurface layer by 0 3 ppt thus once the ice formation is reduced by one third in the barents sea lien and trofimov 2013 the subsurface layer will have the salinity reduced by 0 1 ppt as presented in sections 5 and 6 a drastic change would occur in the surface layer of the eurasian basin due to 0 15 ppt reduction which could be produced by a half reduction in the ice formation in the barents sea the possible contribution estimated above seems significant although we have some additional factors to be examined lien and trofimov 2013 have reported distributions of the water types along the northern shelf break of the barents sea the water mass containing the brine tends to spread along the shelf break while its distribution is variable in time and space so that the denser part may sometimes flow down along the shelf break beyond the atlantic origin water layer arthun et al 2011 if the denser part completely sinks below the atlantic origin water it does not contribute to the increase in the subsurface layer density and hence its cessation would not cause a significant change in the vertical mixing between the surface and the subsurface layers it is necessary to estimate the ratio of the brine rejection which actually mixes within the atlantic origin water using observable information such as geochemical tracers as the other consequence of global warming sea ice melting over the entire arctic ocean gives freshwater to the surface layer this input could make the surface layer less saline along with weaker freshening in the subsurface layer if the vertical mixing is reduced between the surface and subsurface layers the subsurface layer might become warmer and more saline as a long term consequence the water exchange could be increased between the arctic and the atlantic oceans by reducing the density in the upper arctic ocean thus the subsurface layer would receive more atlantic water and become warmer and more saline the latter case has been suggested along the eurasian continental shelves polyakov et al 2010 2012 while it might become less influential after the cessation of a rapid sea ice melting for either case we should examine the sensitivity of the vertical mixing between the surface and subsurface layers more additional effects of the warming trend should be considered so that we may judge how feasible the shift toward the nearly convected state is one of the other possible trends would be accumulation of freshwater in the surface layer proshutinsky et al 2009 showed that the freshwater from the pacific ocean was increased and accumulated in the beaufort gyre in this century the main mechanism was suggested to be wind stresses which could increase the bering strait inflow and also concentrate the surface layer water toward the canada basin however careful observation is needed for the freshwater distribution in the entire arctic ocean this type of freshening could give a significant impact on the vertical mixing between the surface and subsurface layers although it is still an open question whether the wind stress trend would continue under future global warming the conclusion from the estimates made in this section suggests that the shift is possible from the non convected equilibrium state to the convected state under the warming trend however the individual components and mechanisms have to be investigated carefully for their effects on the state shift in essence the vertical stratification could be weakened over a certain criterion due to the realistic warming trend and hence we should make efforts to project the state shift to occur toward more active convection between the surface layer and the subsurface layer in the arctic ocean 7 2 model development direction from a modeling point of view the present research has provided a way to develop and use a three dimensional numerical model at some grids of which the pdfs are implemented by representing sub grid processes the first step will be to implement the pdf in a two box model with one box for the canadian basin and the other for the eurasian basin then the pdf will be implemented in a low resolution model without resolving mesoscale eddies it is suggested to include seasonal variability in the atmospheric forcing it is noted that the heterogeneity generation parameters d t and d s are mainly related with ocean current speeds as well as gradients of t and s between the concerned grid and the adjacent grids mesoscale features are the key players for both heterogeneity generation and horizontal mixing since eddy resolving models have been used widely and compared with observation data the pdf component can have the parameters d t d s m 0 and m 1 estimated appropriately the next application could be the implementation in an eddy resolving model which does not resolve a plume in a convective region in this case submesoscale features which were resolved in sasaki et al 2014 should be used to estimate d t d s m 0 and m 1 it is still difficult to run a plume resolving model for projection of basin scale circulation and hence the model results can be used to suggest the basic behavior of the high resolution models which resolve explicitly the heterogeneity represented by the pdf the advanced pdf box model has suggested in section 6 that when the active box faces both areas with higher and lower salinity it is useful to restrict the inflows over the pdf grids with higher and lower salinity respectively thus the same condition is recommended for a three dimensional model grids of which are located in a horizontal gradient of salinity it is noted that without this condition the convected area might expand or shrink too extensively within the concerned grid and then further influence neighboring grids continuously the new mechanism of pdf progression should be considered in the models having multiple grids implemented with pdf i e the pdf in a grid or box interacts with the pdfs in the adjacent grids or boxes the pdf pdf interactions have not been considered in the present study but should be crucial the most basic interaction may be related with advection between the grids being dependent on velocity fields in the case of interacting grids connected along the vertical direction the water densities associated with the pdfs may be the most crucial components for the pdf pdf interactions sea ice is the other component which has potential of producing interactions although it was simplified to be controlled by thermodynamic consequences of the water portion in the present study it is noted that sea ice is usually deformed due to dynamic processes such as ridging in addition the surface of sea ice is influenced by atmospheric heating and snow fall hence the sea ice model is supposed to be implemented with a pdf defined on a plane of thickness and albedo for the coupled ice ocean processes we would develop a pdf pdf interaction model thus more research is needed to contribute to the pdf modeling projects an additional suggestion would be to learn from the foregoing methods for development of an ocean circulation model implemented with the pdf one of them is the parameterization of water vapor at a sub grid scale of a weather forecast model proposed in tompkins 2002 and tompkins and berne 2008 they defined probability density functions to describe amounts of vapor cloud and others at each grid and examined the usefulness in the weather forecast models furthermore the lattice boltzmann method has been used for a turbulent flow on the basis of a traditional method to examine interactions among gas particles which control a probability of particles associated with each velocity vector chen and doolen 1998 the outcome of these modeling efforts may be useful for the modeling with the pdf defined on t and s also declaration of competing interest

with regard to the use of english appendix a the relationship of the equivalent temperature t and salinity s in the total ice water system is shown here with the actual liquid water temperature t w and salinity s w when the equivalent temperature at the sea surface t t o p 2 t t b is less than the freezing point t f the negative difference is converted to sea ice formation as a 1 c f ρ i ρ w h i 0 5 t f t t o p h 1 where h i is ice thickness m h 1 is the surface layer thickness 200m and c f 80 c is the ice heat of fusion divided by the specific heat of water heat capacity for 1 c ρ i is the ice density 0 9 103 kg m 3 and ρ w is the water density 1 103 kg m 3 the actual liquid water salinity s w is determined from the sum of equivalent salinity s and brine rejection this is expressed as salinity being conserved among the ice water system during ice formation and melting such that a 2 s w h 1 h i ρ i ρ w s i h i ρ i ρ w s h 1 where s i is the salinity of sea ice which is usually 5 ppt for new ice but kept as 0 ppt for simplicity in the present modeling the relationship between s w and t s is shown in fig a 1 while t w t for t 1 and t w 1 for t 1 appendix b the condition is examined for existence of the salinity driven state es 1 and the temperature driven state es 2 considering that sea ice does not affect essential behaviors of the thermohaline circulation the simpler equation set eq 2 1 is used here for the same reason vertical convection is omitted in eq 2 1 at the steady states t and s satisfy the following equations b 1a k t t a t q s t s t 0 b 1b k s s a s q s s s s 0 eq 2 2 and 2 4 have to be satisfied so that ρ and q s may be determined two solutions are determined from the cross points of the solid line and the dashed lines on the t s plane in fig b 1 the solid line satisfies eq b 1 with continuous values of q s q which are not determined from eq 2 4 but vary from 0 to infinity relevant to t s t a s a and t s s s respectively the character of the solid line is curvature toward the s axis caused by k t k s the solid line can be plotted with some value of t giving the value of q from eq b 2a and then the value of s s from eq b 2b b 2a q k t t a t t s t b 2b s k s s a q s s k s q the dashed lines are plotted on the basis of the dotted line which satisfies ρ ρ s where ρ is calculated from eq 2 2 the location t s of the dotted line is determined as b 3 β s α 0 α 1 t t ρ s by calculating the values of s with the values of t given crossing the point t s t s s s the locations t s and t s of the dashed lines are drawn relatively to the dotted line by setting common t values along with q values from eq b 2a s and s are determined from eq 2 4 b 4a β s β s q c s b 4b β s β s q c s therefore q s is equal to q on the dashed lines at the cross points between the solid line and the dashed lines eqs b 1a b 1b 2 2 and 2 4 are satisfied for the parameter values specified in this study the dashed line with s s does not cross the solid line therefore there is only one cross point with s s at which the active box has density lower than the external box the gin seas hence the cross point is categorized as es 1 salinity driven state since the dotted line shifts to smaller s caused by more contribution of temperature to density the number of the cross points is examined with the temperature range increased as t 0 is changed to 7 c so that t a and t s are increased by 7 c three cross points appear among these three cross points es 1 is the one with the smallest t and s while the point with the largest t and s is categorized as es 2 temperature driven state at which the active box has density higher than the external box the middle point es u is categorized as an unstable state to which a time dependent solution of eq 2 1 does not converge when t 0 is set to 7 c convergence occurs to es 1 with t 2 6 c s 32 6 ppt or es 2 with t 3 5 c s 33 7 ppt logically the stability is expressed with the signs of dt dt t and ds dt s if both gradients are negative the state is stable even if one of the gradients is positive the state is unstable from eq 2 1 without the convection terms the gradients are at es 1 b 5a t d t d t k t q s q s t t s t k

analytical solutions of eq b 1 with t 0 7 c is t s 2 63 32 58 which expresses a stable state with eq b 5 and is identified as es 1 two other solutions are t s 3 12 33 42 and t s 3 54 33 73 the substitution for all parameters in eq b 6 shows that the former is unstable and identified as es u while the latter is stable and identified as es 2 appendix c the steady solutions are analyzed with quantitative descriptions of the terms in eq 2 5 the relationships are also described among the equivalent temperature and salinity t and s with sea ice thickness h i and also the liquid water temperature and salinity t w and s w for the basic case of the simple box model es 1 has t 2 25 c at the mid depth and hence t t o p 4 5 c eq a 1 provides h i 1 25 200 80 0 9 3 125 0 9 3 472 m eq a 2 gives s w 33 27 200 200 3 125 33 80 the terms in eq 2 5 are evaluated from the solution at es 1 the air sea heat flux coefficient k t 0 419 10 8 s 1 calculated from eq 2 6 gives the first term to be 1 26 10 8 c s 1 in eq 2 5a here a negative value denotes a flux coming out of the surface layer thus the annual mean air sea heat flux is about 11 w m 2 on the basis of the surface layer thickness water density and specific heat of 4 2 103 j c 1 kg 1 the water density difference is 0 346 kg m 3 between the mid depth of the surface layer and the subsurface layer from eq 2 2 giving k b 0 098 10 8 s 1 from eq 2 3a hence the second term is 0 10 10 8 c s 1 and the annual mean flux of vertical mixing is less than 1 w m 2 the water density difference of 0 282 kg m 3 between the surface layer and the gin seas yields q s 0 282 10 8 s 1 from eq 2 4 and hence the third term becomes 1 20 10 8 c s 1 and about 10 w m 2 in eq 2 5a due to the inflow from the gin seas the first term in eq 2 5b is evaluated to be 0 372 10 8 ppt s 1 from k s 0 02 10 8 s 1 and the salinity difference between s a and s the second term is 0 049 10 8 ppt s 1 based on k b 0 098 10 8 s 1 and s b s w and the third term is 0 319

23973,the quality of metocean forecasts at longer forecast ranges has a significant impact on maritime safety and offshore operations a nonlinear ensemble averaging technique is demonstrated using neural networks applied to one year 2017 of global ocean wave ensemble forecast system gwes data provided by ncep post processing algorithms are developed based on multilayer perceptron neural networks nn trained with altimeter data to improve the global forecast skill from nowcast to forecast ranges up to 10 days including significant wave height hs and wind speed u10 nns are applied as an alternative to the typical use of the arithmetic ensemble mean em nn models are constructed using six variables sourced from 21 ensemble members plus latitude sin cos of longitude sin cos of time forecast lead time and gwes cycle the nn outputs are the residues of hs and u10 i e the difference from the em to the observations one hidden intermediate layer is evaluated in terms of the optimum number of neurons complexity to map the given problem the sensitivity test considered 26 different numbers of neurons 10 seeds for initial conditions and 3 equally divided datasets for a total of 780 nn experiments assessments using 2 507 099 paired satellite gwes fields show that a simple nn model with few neurons is able to reduce the systematic errors for short range forecasts while a nn with more neurons is required to minimize the scatter error at longer forecast ranges the novel method shows that one single nn model with 140 neurons is able to improve the error metrics for the whole globe while covering all forecast ranges analyzed the bias of the widely used em of gwes that varies from 10 to 10 for hs compared to altimeters can be reduced to values within 5 the rmse of day 10 forecasts from the nn simulations indicated a gain of two days in predictability when compared to the em using a reasonably simple post processing model with low computational cost keywords neural networks ensemble forecast non linear ensemble averaging wave modeling altimeter data 1 introduction accurate forecasts of surface winds and waves are essential for activities such as ship routing high risk maritime operations coastal management and alerts of extreme events extending wave forecast skill throughout longer forecast horizons requires multiple research initiatives from improved modeling for example incorporating atmosphere ocean coupling e g janssen et al 2002 to improved data assimilation methods such as coupled data assimilation penny et al 2017 while these improvements represent important benefits to the predictability of metocean variables deterministic forecasts are still limited in their usefulness for outlooks beyond one week due to the chaotic behavior of the atmosphere ocean wave coupled system for example as pointed out by lorenz 1963 using a simple model of the atmosphere using an ensemble of multiple forecasts can extend the range of skillful predictions often out to 10 days with the additional benefit of providing a measure of the uncertainty via the spread of predictions ensemble members the arithmetic ensemble mean em typically yields smaller forecast errors compared to the mean error of each individual member murphy 1988 which has been confirmed for both atmospheric ensemble forecasts zhou et al 2017 and wave ensemble forecasts cao et al 2009 alves et al 2013 since 1992 the european centre for medium range weather forecasts ecmwf and the u s national centers for environmental prediction ncep have produced operational ensemble forecasts saetra and bidlot 2004 investigated the quality of the ecmwf ensemble prediction system using buoy and satellite data an interesting improvement to ship routing using the ecmwf wave ensemble system was analyzed by hoffschildt et al 1999 the ncep atmospheric global ensemble forecast system gefs was recently assessed by zhou et al 2017 and the ncep global wave ensemble system gwes has been described by chen 2006 cao et al 2009 and evaluated by alves et al 2013 they found that after the day 5 forecasts the root mean square error of the ensemble mean becomes smaller than the control forecast however the general bias does not show any improvement as expected this feature has been confirmed by campos et al 2018b who calculated the systematic and scatter errors of 10 m wind speed u10 and significant wave height hs from ncep ensemble forecast using buoy measurements at longer forecast ranges beyond one week campos et al 2018b found an improvement of 20 on the scatter index of the em compared to the control run and no significant improvement on the systematic error nevertheless even with the benefits of the ensemble approach large forecast errors are still present beyond the day 7 forecasts demanding further post processing techniques zieger et al 2018 implemented a regional wave ensemble forecast system and developed a technique to bias correct the mean value using multivariate linear regression based on glahn and lowry 1972 durrant et al 2009 based on woodcock and greenslade 2007 developed an operational consensus forecast scheme that uses past model performance to bias correct and combine forecasts to produce an improved product at locations where recent observations are available for 24 hour forecasts their methodology produced improvements of 36 and 31 in rmse of hs and u10 compared to the mean raw model components following a similar idea harpham et al 2016 developed a bayesian statistical method that modifies the probabilities of ensemble forecasts based on recent performance of individual members against a set of observations these works are examples of bias correction methods which are mostly based on multivariate linear regression and estimation of dynamic weights applied to ensemble members moving to a nonlinear mapping our goal is to develop post processing algorithms based on neural networks nn trained with altimeter data to improve the ncep s gwes this approach enhances the traditional em to a nonlinear ensemble average that aims to reduce both the systematic and scatter errors of u10 and hs in our previous works campos et al 2017 2019b we introduced a nn technique to perform a regional nonlinear ensemble averaging based on buoy data in this work we generalize the previously developed technique to global scale forecasts using altimetry data we describe the neural network model in section 2 the global ensemble and observations as well as the data organizing and pairing are described in section 3 section 4 is dedicated to sensitivity tests and construction of neural network models investigating the complexity necessary to address the global mapping section 5 shows the results and provide a discussion about the benefits and shortcomings of the method and section 6 presents the final conclusions challenges and suggestions of next steps 2 nonlinear mapping using neural networks the assessments of the ncep ensemble forecast system performed by campos et al 2018b 2017 based on mentaschi et al 2013 draw attention to the multivariate and nonlinear aspects of the forecast error typically the interpretation of ensemble outputs is mostly based on the mean and standard deviation or spread of the ensemble members however use of the em assumes that a linear relationship between ensemble members is optimal while this relationship may in fact be strongly nonlinear particularly at longer lead times in order to address these nonlinear relationships we propose using feedforward nn models to produce an ensemble average as a post processing alternative trained with quality controlled observations a multilayer perceptron nn model mlp nn rumelhart et al 1986 has been selected due to its previous successes being a powerful universal mapping approximator hornik 1991 while being flexible and easy to implement on regression problems the mlp nn is a feed forward artificial nn that uses supervised learning and consists of three or more layers one input layer one or more hidden layers and one output layer in this study only one hidden layer is used though we vary the number of nodes to properly identify the minimum complexity and avoid over fitting the mlp nn implemented is based on the theory of haykin 1999 and implementation support of krasnopolsky 2013 eq 1 presents the mlp nn model which is built with hyperbolic tangent as the activation function 1 n n x 1 x 2 x n a b y q a q 0 j 1 k a q j h b j 0 i 1 n b j i x i q 1 2 m x i are the inputs y q the outputs a and b are the weights n and m are the numbers of inputs and outputs respectively the number of nodes neurons or hyperbolic tangents is given by k the optimization of parameters a and b is based on backpropagation training using gradient decent at each iteration the loss function is calculated as the square of the error obtained from the forward propagation of the inputs minus the observations which is then propagated backwards using the derivative of the activation function 1 tanh x 2 in order to correct the weights it has been verified that efficient optimization is obtained with the stochastic gradient decent described by kingma and ba 2014 chosen for the nn training the selection of a large and reliable set of measurements the number of iterations and the number of neurons are key aspects during the training process as a pre processing step a quality control is applied to exclude outliers and then input and output variables are rescaled between 0 and 1 according to eq 2 this process is later inverted after nn simulations 2 x i 0 1 x i x i m i n x i m a x x i m i n such nn models have gained increasing use in environmental problems examples for wave forecasting problems include sánchez et al 2018 concerning wave energy potential mandal and prabaharan 2006 for forecast of hs in india dixit and londhe 2016 for extreme hs simulations from hurricanes using a neuro wavelet technique berbić et al 2017 for short term predictions of hs among other applications described by krasnopolsky 2013 the first step towards the nonlinear ensemble averaging using nn was taken by campos et al 2017 who developed mlp nn models for two point wise locations on the east and west coasts of the united states trained with ndbc buoy data despite initial problems with excess noise and risk of over fitting a simple nn model with 11 nodes neurons and one hidden layer was effective in reducing the 5 day forecast errors of hs by 64 for bias and 29 for rmse rasp and lerch 2018 applied a similar neural network model for postprocessing ensemble weather forecasts of 2 m temperature at surface stations in germany being able to outperform benchmark postprocessing methods with low computational cost later developments by campos et al 2019b expanded the single point approach of campos et al 2017 to a regional modeling application introducing the spatial dimension into the nn using six ndbc buoys in the gulf of mexico 105 600 nns were built with different architectures and initial conditions in order to investigate the ability of nns to reduce scatter errors and systematic errors present in the gwes the most effective nn models of campos et al 2019b were found with 35 to 50 neurons in the hidden layer which improved the correlation coefficient of day 10 forecasts from 0 39 to 0 61 for u10 and from 0 50 to 0 76 for hs when comparing to the em we note that both campos et al 2017 2019b developed one independent nn per forecast time from 0 nowcast to 10 days upper limit of gwes and the training process was static based on one year of measurements and not dynamic or online as some of the references described before this means that once the model is trained the post processing algorithm and nn parameters are not modified even when recent observations become available unless a re training is applied as a follow up of campos et al 2019b our present study has two specific technical challenges 1 to expand the domain from a small basin gulf of mexico of campos et al 2019b to the whole globe and 2 develop a single nn model that can minimize the error at all forecast horizons from the nowcast out to 10 days and beyond fig 1 illustrates the first challenge where different wind and wave climates can be visualized through the correlation coefficient cc of u10 and hs locations in red indicate large cc where hs is usually high when surface winds are intense on the other hand locations in blue where cc is low often have relatively large waves without strong winds probably due to the passage of mature swells at trade winds zones fig 1 is a simple illustration of how the homogeneous climate within the gulf of mexico explored by campos et al 2019b compares to the whole globe explored in the present study this indicates the need for proper spatial modeling in the nn simulations and sufficient amount of observations during the training process in order to build a single best nn model to cover all forecast leads in global simulations we use observations of wind speed u10 and wave height hs covering the whole globe as provided by satellite altimeters as described in section 3 and consequently we use the same quantities as the output variables of the nns the inputs for the nn model include all of the variables that benefit the mapping which consists of input information with high correlation with outputs and verified physical meaning for each ensemble member plus spatiotemporal parameters such as location time and forecast lead time discussed in section 4 inspired by the gwes forecast of hurricane mathew in the east coast of the united states fig 2 campos et al 2017 proposed a slightly different setup of the nn outputs fig 2 shows the ability of the em of the day 5 gwes forecast in predicting an extreme event the first part of the storm was very well simulated while the second peak was overestimated by the forecast in this case the traditional em produces a skillful forecast for early part of the event implying no need for post processing intervention while the later part of the storm has a significant drop in skill indicated post processing is required as a result the suggestion of campos et al 2017 was to use nns to predict the anomaly or residue of the forecast i e the difference between the measurement and the em predicting the residue or residual has an advantage during the training process of not updating the nn parameters eq 1 during the backpropagation training when the em is already relatively accurate while reserving the largest updates to the weights a and b for the times when the em severely deviates from the observations this approach agrees with the paradigm that nn should be applied to nonlinear problems only krasnopolsky 2013 chpt 1 and 2 i e the linear part is adequately represented by the em while the nonlinear component is simulated by the nn through the prediction of the residue by using the residue predicted by the mlp nn combined with the em eq 1 is now embedded in eq 3 where the nonlinear ensemble averaging nem is finally calculated campos et al 2017 demonstrated the success of this approach for a range of percentiles including extreme events with fewer samples in the database the top percentiles are usually associated with larger errors campos et al 2018b that lead to larger updates of nn weights fig 3 illustrates the model selected as the basis of our global nn simulations and table 1 shows the nn inputs outputs and nn experiments described in detail in section 4 3 n e m e m n n r p 1 p 2 p n the hybrid system fig 3 uses the combination of the em with the nn prediction of the residue to obtain final estimates of u10 and hs which are then assessed against altimeter observations willmott et al 1985 provide a complete discussion about environmental model assessments using metrics to analyze the accuracy and precision of model results mentaschi et al 2013 present a recent valuable complement to this topic with a discussion about limitations of rmse and how it can be complemented by other metrics to have a reliable estimation of the systematic and scatter components of the error among the equations given by mentaschi et al 2013 we prefer to utilize normalized metrics since the model performance is assessed in a global domain including wind and wave climates with different severities thus three normalized error metrics are utilized to evaluate the results normalized bias nbias that measures the systematic error scatter index si that measures the scatter error and normalized rmse nrmse that combines the systematic and scatter components eqs 4 to 6 describe the dimensionless metrics selected where x is the altimeter data y is the forecast and σ x is the standard deviation of x the overbar indicates the arithmetic mean by using these three normalized metrics without units plots and tables of errors can be interpreted as ratios or percentage errors divided by 100 4 n b i a s i 1 n y i x i i 1 n x i 5 s i i 1 n y i y x i x 2 i 1 n x i 2 6 n r m s e i 1 n y i x i 2 i 1 n x i 2 s i 2 n b i a s 2 x 2 x 2 σ x 2 3 input data and observations we use one year of 2017 forecast data from the ncep global ensemble system and satellite observations selected for the same period the gwes was implemented in 2005 chen 2006 cao et al 2009 and is based on the third generation wave model wavewatch iii tolman 2016 the current gwes version alves et al 2013 used in the present paper runs a 10 day forecast with four cycles per day with a space time resolution of 0 5 and 3 h and produces ensemble forecasts using 20 gefs forced members plus a control member described by zhou et al 2017 winds and ice concentration are used as forcing fields from the gefs which was first implemented in 1992 toth and kalnay 1993 the gefs initialization scheme was recently replaced zhou et al 2017 from the breeding based ensemble transformation with rescaling etr to the ensemble kalman filter scheme enkf whitaker et al 2008 the space time resolution of surface winds from gefs is the same as gwes 0 5 and 3 h ice concentrations are obtained from ncep s automated ice analysis wu and grumbine 2013 note that perturbations are solely added to the atmospheric ensemble in gefs behrens 2015 and farina 2002 argue that atmospheric forecast models represent highly nonlinear dynamic systems that could generate chaotic forecasts due to small perturbations in the initial condition while perturbations of the initial state in wave models have small effects on the results therefore the wave ensemble integrates 21 independent simulations of the wave model that differ in the provided forcing conditions gwes only propagates to the wave spectra the perturbations added to the atmospheric model the quality controlled altimeter data used for training nn outputs were obtained from two sources aviso and nesdis the altimeter missions jason2 jason3 and saral were downloaded from aviso ftp area while cryosat2 was obtained from nesdis complete assessments of altimeter data can be found at queffeulou 2004 2012 2013 sepulveda et al 2015 and queffeulou and croizé fillon 2017 comparisons with buoys show that the altimeter estimate of hs is in general in agreement with in situ data with the differences having a standard deviation around 0 3 m depending on the satellite with a small overestimation at low hs and underestimation for high hs taking into account that level of uncertainty is much smaller than forecast errors altimeter data from the two sources above can be directly applied for the nn training after a quick additional quality control the along track altimeter data are organized and collocated into the regular grid of gwes using the kd tree algorithm and based on the methodology of young and holland 1996 and sepulveda et al 2015 considering the high sampling rate of the satellite track all measurements with a maximum space distance of 25 km and time distance of 0 5 h are allocated to each grid point lat lon at a specific time the multiple altimeter records within this cube of lat lon time are selected and a gaussian function applied to weight values by distance to the center point in order to give a single altimeter data matching the gwes grid point fig 4 illustrates the collocated altimeter data over the globe for the duration of the nn experiment furthermore two additional criteria are imposed to exclude satellite gwes matchups at shallow and intermediate waters or located close to the coast these criteria avoid increasing errors of altimeter data due to footprint averaging size and restrict the nn emulation to deep waters we use etopo1 bathymetry amante and eakins 2009 with 1 arc minute of resolution and a measure of distance from the coast with 0 04 degrees resolution from nasa s goddard space flight center database we select a minimum water depth of 490 m and minimum distance from the coast of 100 km applying these criteria a total count of 7 521 298 satellite gwes matchups between 60 s and 60 n are allocated to gwes grid points at 3 hourly time resolution for analysis of results the largest oceans are delimited using the world seas database iho 1953 containing a demarcation of oceans and seas giving 817 516 matchups of satellite gwes in the north atlantic 1 280 934 in the south atlantic 1 601 452 in the north pacific 2 175 888 in the south pacific and 1 645 508 in the indian ocean for single hindcast simulations the 7 521 298 matchups described before would consist of pairs of one vector of model variables see section 4 per altimeter value however there are two additional dimensions ensemble members and forecast time so each altimeter record is paired to a matrix exemplified by fig 5 the inclusion of forecast time paired to altimeter data must be applied with caution because the sequence of records at any specific location is made sparser by shifting satellite orbits for each altimeter measurement at any lat lon time we move backwards in time and select gwes predictions all valid at the same location and time for example taking the 24 hour forecast step of the preceding 1 day gwes cycle then the 48 hour forecast step of the preceding 2 day gwes cycle etc this process can be applied with the ncep cycle resolution of 6 h giving 41 sets of forecast leads within the time horizon of 10 days the matrix of 21 ensemble members per 41 forecast instants provides 861 model values that with an accurate forecast should be similar to the single satellite observation fig 5 exemplifies this matrix where on the nowcast gwes is performing very well for the first four forecast days gwes slightly overestimates the observations and beyond the 5th day there is a severe underestimation of the forecast that should be attenuated by the nn post processing model 4 neural network architecture and sensitivity tests the mlp nn models were constructed based on eqs 1 and 3 nn inputs include six variables 10 m wind intensity u10 significant wave height hs peak wave period tp mean wave period tm significant wave height of wind sea wsh and period of wind sea tws for each of 20 ensemble members plus the control member initial tests included only hs u10 and tp as nn inputs however after expanding the simulations to the whole globe the addition of tm wsh and tsw were found to provide valuable information about the wave spectra needed to differentiate mature swell from young wind sea wave generation from propagation zones and different wind and wave climates fig 1 zieger et al 2018 in their study of ensemble forecasts in australia confirmed the benefit of including wind sea features such as significant wave height and period of wind waves that improve the overall spectral information and the ensemble prediction the geographical space is represented with three additional nn inputs latitude and sine and cosine of longitude eq 7 the sine and cosine of time days are added as inputs in order to include an annual cycle and seasonal effects to the mapping presented in eq 8 furthermore forecast lead time is included varying from 0 to 10 days as well as gwes forecast cycle 0 6 12 18 this results in a total of 133 variables as the nn inputs 126 gwes variables 3 variables for location 2 for time and 2 variables for forecast lead time and cycle 7 l o n s i n sin 2 π l o n 360 l o n c o s cos 2 π l o n 360 8 t s i n sin 2 π t i m e 365 t c o s t cos 2 π t i m e 365 nns do not automatically understand periodic and cyclic variables if not stated for example time where month 1 comes after month 12 and hour 0 comes after 23 longitude 180 comes after 179 etc therefore sine and cosine had to be applied to time and longitude as presented by equations above increasing the number of variables the nn outputs are composed of two variables only the residues of u10 and hs presented by fig 3 the hidden or intermediate layer containing the hyperbolic tangents controls the complexity of the mapping the computational and functional complexity of the nn mapping n c of mlp nn 1 can be defined by eq 9 following krasnopolsky 2013 as in eq 1 n and m are the total numbers of inputs and outputs and k is the number of nodes neurons in one hidden layer once the nn inputs and outputs are defined and fixed the complexity is controlled by k we focus on identifying the most effective value for k which is problem and domain dependent the optimal n c for the nn global modeling is unknown so we conduct an experiment with several nn simulations with different number of neurons k the test aims to find a single nn model with the best configuration of the hidden layer and optimized parameters a and b 9 n c k n m 1 m a total of 26 different numbers of neurons are tested through independent nn simulations 2 5 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 90 100 110 120 130 140 150 160 180 200 250 300 350 400 450 and 500 ten different seeds for random initialization of a and b of eq 1 are used to estimate the sensitivity of the backpropagation training algorithm to the initial weights and to find better initial weights the dataset of 7 521 298 matchups of satellite gwes is randomly divided into three datasets where the nns are trained and assessed independently this allows a further analysis of the robustness of the nn model and reduces memory load during the computational costly training step the entire sensitivity test considers 26 different numbers of neurons 10 seeds and 3 datasets giving a total of 780 independent nns table 1 summarizes the nn architecture and nn simulations performed besides the data division a cross validation scheme with three cycles was applied to each dataset previously divided and independent to each other alternating indexes defined for training and testing by using the leave one out method in summary cross validation was applied three times where each one selected 2 9 of the entire dataset for training and 1 9 for testing this approach was selected to ensure that nn assessments are applied to records that were not used during training and combined to a sufficiently small number of neurons and iterations avoids over fitting over training and ensures better generalization results of sensitivity tests results involving nn simulation for the three different randomly selected datasets see previous paragraph are averaged since errors are very similar among them and then presented as a function of the number of neurons and plotted divided into training and test sets the systematic error of the em of gwes is around 3 written on top of the left column plots in fig 6 while the nns errors are bounded within 1 and 1 a very small error involving nn with both small and large number of neurons similar values of nbias are found for u10 and hs presented by fig 6 the scatter indexes si indicate better results for hs than u10 where the em has 24 5 of error for u10 and 21 for hs these values drop to 23 for u10 and 19 for hs when using nns a relative improvement that is smaller than the improvement found for nbias the evolution of the si with the number of neurons shows a minimum value that corresponds to more neurons than the same for nbias where a sharp decay is seen between 2 to 50 neurons these differences however are only 0 38 in the scatter error among various numbers of neurons the best results of nrmse which combines the scatter and systematic errors eq 6 shown in the right column of plots of fig 6 are found between 60 to 180 neurons but within a range of only 0 31 above 200 neurons the si and the nrmse start to increase again the difference between training and test sets is small fig 6 suggesting that there is no overtraining during the backpropagation training step however there is variation due to the use of different seeds such that the results tend to diverge above 200 neurons with increasing spread this indicates that the nn models might be over fitted and implies that the complexity of nn 9 is greater than needed for the three different metrics and two output variables the nn models have smaller errors than both the em and control member top of each plot in fig 6 thus from aforementioned analysis we conclude that the best nn models should have between 60 to 180 neurons at the intermediate layer however this result comes from the assessment integrated over the entire gwes forecast range of 10 days while errors increase significantly with forecast horizon which impacts the nn training fig 7 presents the same results as fig 6 but for three different forecast lead times day 0 nowcast day 5 and day 10 where each point related to a specific number of neurons is an average of 30 nns 10 seeds and 3 datasets the nrmse for hs reaches minimum at 80 and 90 neurons for different forecast leads for u10 on day 0 the sharp decay of the curve suggests the best results with 50 to 80 neurons and values above 90 have larger nrmse for day 5 a second minimum is found around 160 to 180 neurons the longest forecast range day 10 shows the best results between 120 and 180 neurons also indicating larger nrmse for nn with neurons equal or less than 110 therefore the increasing scatter error of the surface winds at longer forecast ranges is the main feature that requires more complex nns another characteristic to notice is the distance between the nn curves of training and test set on day 0 they are very close to each other while for day 5 and 10 the test set changes to larger nrmse than the training set indicating the greater difficulty of the nn in simulating longer forecast ranges the assessment of 780 nns averaged through the three different datasets 260 results presented can be further visualized into the two dimensional space of scatter and systematic error fig 8 all nns represented by the cloud of circles in fig 8 performed better than the em and control run red and cyan squares on the left plots for both types of errors systematic and scatter and indicates the success of the approach the systematic errors of hs and u10 presented by nbias are especially small between 2 and 2 while the scatter errors are between 19 and 23 the clouds of training and test points of fig 8 are close to each other so nns are not over fitted and have generalization capability the selection of the best nn model among the tests relies on a defined criterion assigning scores to each nn based on the error metrics the right plots of fig 8 provide a more detailed view of test set results where the dot size is proportional to the variance of si through the forecast range divided by the si i e nns with good results for the whole range of forecast have small points while nns that improved some forecast ranges but not others are depicted by points that have large diameters this last situation occurs mostly in nns with few neurons and high values of si at the top of the cloud of points of fig 8 based on these plots the best nns are expected to have more than 30 neurons and can simulate very well a wide range of forecast leads the decision about the best nn was based on three steps the first one restricted the nn results within a maximum systematic error of 0 5 including hs and u10 as nbias is very small for most of the nns a total of 326 nns of the 780 have absolute nbias of u10 smaller than 0 005 while for hs this amount is 294 the combined restriction for both variables leads to 144 nns with extremely small and therefore acceptable biases the second step sorted the arrays of nns error metrics building arrays in ascending order for each type of error with ids related to each nn model the third step looked at the top values of the rank best results of correlation coefficient cc and si for hs and u10 searching for the best nn that minimize the scatter errors of both waves and winds it has been verified that the top ranking nn models that minimize certain scatter error metric such as si also maximize the correlation coefficient which makes the final selection much easier three nns were identified with very similar values from which the best one was selected containing 140 neurons at the hidden layer although the goal of the post processing simulations is to prioritize hs the selection of optimum nns that also minimize the error of u10 is important since both output variables are correlated and the wave generation process depends of the quality of surface winds 5 results of global simulations and discussion once the best nn architecture and parameters have been determined the performance of the selected nn was evaluated using an independent set of altimeter data that was not included in the backpropagation training this includes 2 507 099 matchups of satellite gwes distributed over the whole globe figs 9 and 10 present global maps of systematic and scatter errors comparing the em with the nn nonlinear average the matchups are grouped in bins 61 latitudes and 181 longitudes within a radius of 2 to compute the error statistics for each location nbias of fig 9 shows a strong spatial dependence of gwes errors reflecting areas of occurrence of tropical and extra tropical storms where the atmospheric model data errors are expected to be larger than in other areas and regions in the tropical ocean exposed to swell systems that may either propagate extratropical storm wind field errors or indicate intrinsic wave model source term biases in mid and high latitudes the em tends to overestimate observed values from altimeters this is particularly evident in the southern hemisphere in the tropics the em tends to underestimate the observed values with an exception of area along the itcz in the pacific ocean the systematic error of the em varies from 10 to 10 at most locations the nonlinear ensemble average using nn reduces this bias to values within 5 the benefit is greater at mid latitudes dominated by extratropical cyclones where the nbias of the em can reach 12 for hs however errors along the equator in the eastern pacific ocean are not improved possibly due to the small correlation of hs and u10 as illustrated in fig 1 the global maps of si fig 10 indicate significant errors for both u10 and hs at extra tropical latitudes again reflecting areas where forcing errors are expected to be larger due to the occurrence of tropical and extra tropical storms or to the dominance of swells the hs maps present larger errors at western portions of the oceans and concerning the southern hemisphere the south atlantic ocean has larger errors than the indian and south pacific oceans si in general reaches up to 40 for u10 and 30 for hs the nn provided additional skill that is not restricted to specific locations but distributed over the globe comparing figs 9 and 10 it is possible to conclude that the relative improvement due to the nn on the si is smaller than the improvement found for nbias in addition for practical applications it is important to have the total rmse with the same unit as the significant wave height hs in meters combining both error components presented by fig 11 as a final global map we include the deterministic forecast control run to provide an overview of the progress associated with each step a significant improvement occurs moving from the control run to the ensemble mean em where the rmse at extra tropical locations is reduced by approximately 30 and confirms the success of the ensemble methodology described by zhou et al 2017 and alves et al 2013 the nn post processing simulation acts especially on the locations with large rmse at mid latitudes and provides an additional reduction of 20 at these locations so after the hybrid modeling neural network attached to the ensemble forecast illustrated by fig 3 and eq 3 almost the entire globe has average rmse of hs bound to one meter in order to further contribute to the spatial discussion of results table 2 divides the assessment in five ocean basins using the world seas database initially described the differences in performance among the oceans are very small and the nn is proven to be suitable for all parts of the globe table 2 indicates that the ensemble is adding bias to the control run which is greatly reduced by the nn in terms of scatter error the em significantly reduces the si of the control run by approximately 25 and the nn provides an additional small reduction of 5 to 10 of si values we do not divide the global assessment maps into several figures related to forecast lead days because it would reduce the total data volume of matchups at the bins over the globe therefore figs 9 and 10 as well as table 2 integrate the results over the 10 days forecast range and inevitably insert more weight into the analyses and comparisons involving longer lead times associated with larger errors the final fig 12 shows the error metrics as a function of the forecast lead time providing a meaningful assessment of the nonlinear wave ensemble averaging using nn a total of 61 149 matchups of satellite gwes per forecast time is utilized to compose the plots fig 12 shows that nbias is reduced to values between 0 to 2 throughout the whole range this improvement is especially important after the day 7 forecasts when the control run tends to underestimate and em tends to overestimate the observations the si plot indicates a small reduction of the error by the nn equally distributed over the lead times taking the right part of the si plot associated with the longest horizons the results of the nn on day 10 have the same error of the em on day 8 equal to 27 which represents an extension of 2 days in terms of predictability if the nn averaging is used eq 6 presents the combination of nbias and si into the nrmse also included in fig 12 the growth pattern is similar to the si plot which is expected after comparing the y axis of nbias and si plots that indicate much larger errors coming from the scatter component the correlation coefficient cc is the most challenging metric to improve but the nn model was able to slightly improve the values compared with the em especially at longer forecast lead times the comparison of plots in fig 12 allows one to have a valuable overview of the benefits and shortcomings of the nn post processing method the operational implementation of the post processing algorithm is simple once the nn parameters a b of eq 1 and normalization parameters eq 2 are obtained the simulation is straightforward following three steps 1 the inputs must be downloaded or linked from the ncep ensemble forecast system which are then normalized and reshaped to build the input array for the nn program 2 the nn simulation is run covering the latitude longitude and forecast time generating the global residue and 3 outputs invert the initial normalization the proper shape of the array is rebuilt and the residues are added to the em fields of hs and u10 to construct the final output file in our case in netcdf or grib2 format as described before the training process is the step that requires more computational power daily runs following gwes cycles however can be performed by single core processors 2 ghz taking approximately five minutes in python language we believe this might be further improved and time consumed can be reduced it is important to stress again that our methodology based on neural networks does not intend to replace the numerical modeling of the physical processes or the ensemble approach instead we have developed a framework maintaining the ensemble forecast as provided by ncep and including a soft computing neural network as a post processing step linking the traditional modeling with a machine learning algorithm that improves the ensemble mean trained with a large amount of altimeter data the post processing algorithm using multilayer perceptron neural networks is simple enough to be used as a bias correction to deterministic forecasts same methodology but with only one member however it is proved that ensemble forecasts significantly reduce the scatter errors at longer forecast ranges zhou et al 2017 campos et al 2019a so the best solution considering the hybrid modeling is to attach the neural network to outputs of ensemble forecast systems 6 conclusions a large set of experiments was conducted to develop neural networks to post process and bias correct operational ensemble wave forecasts where the target variable is primarily hs followed by u10 the main goal was to build a nn model trained with altimeter data able to calculate nonlinear ensemble averages that outperform the typical arithmetic ensemble mean applied to the whole globe and covering a forecast range of 10 days simplicity of post processing algorithms has been a priority during the project an analysis of 780 nns facilitated identifying an effective architecture and complexity of the problem as well as testing the generalization and the distribution of the error with forecast lead times latitudes and longitudes a previous study by campos et al 2019b focusing on the gulf of mexico found the best nn configurations with 35 to 50 neurons in the hidden layer expanding to our global simulation it was found that 60 to 180 neurons produce the best results the complexity of the nn models described by eq 9 necessary to address global nonlinear ensemble averages involves a deeper discussion that depends on the output variable of interest forecast range and the type of error it was shown that minimizing hs errors require fewer neurons around 80 than u10 more than 100 the same is valid for shorter and longer forecast ranges simpler nn models with 60 to 80 neurons produce the smallest errors in the nowcast while 120 neurons are needed when considering the day 10 forecasts overall simple nn models are able to reduce the systematic errors of hs at short range forecasts while nn models with more neurons are necessary to minimize the scatter error of u10 at longer forecast ranges after a limit around 200 neurons increasing the complexity of nn models resulted in larger errors and loss of generalization the best nn overall configuration was found to have 140 neurons at the hidden layer taking the results from one year of simulations 2017 we found that the nns are efficient in reducing global systematic errors the average nbias was reduced from an average of 3 5 for the em to less than 1 globally which was further confirmed to be valid in all the five oceans analyzed separately scatter errors were more difficult to reduce however the nns did provide a small improvement of si especially for hs the nrmse combines the systematic and scatter components of error eq 6 and confirms the effectiveness of the nonlinear ensemble average using global nn trained with altimeter data which was able to improve the nrmse throughout the whole range of forecasts using the nn based nonlinear averaging the day 10 forecasts have the same nrmse as the day 8 forecasts for the arithmetic ensemble mean a gain of two forecast days in predictability we believe that the methodology described can be successfully extended to even longer forecast ranges which requires a new setup of the operational wave ensemble forecast of ncep noaa that nowadays is limited to 10 days further we believe that integrating the nn methods with coupled atmosphere ocean wave forecasts and coupled data assimilation penny and hamill 2017 penny et al 2017 may further extend this prediction capability as well as introducing wave parameters from spectral partitions into the nn inputs which could benefit lower latitudes with multiple distant swells in terms of future developments besides the extension of forecast horizon the construction of neural network based ensembles is a promising example of a growing trend to incorporate machine learning into weather forecasting boukabara et al 2019 the criterion of selecting the best nn among the tests led to the choice of a single nn whereas krasnopolsky and lin 2012 showed that multiple nn simulations developing an ensemble of nns produced successful results for precipitation forecasts in the united states specific nn ensembles suitable for extreme wave conditions can also be developed in the future following the track of the storms as performed by campos et al 2018a or even building nn members trained for tropical cyclones which represent a unique family of events our study focused on large basins in deep water future nn developments are needed to cover coastal areas lakes small seas and locations close to the arctic influenced by sea ice our last suggestion and plan are to include multi model ensembles in the nn post processing algorithm introducing more input variables into the nns in addition to the ncep ensemble members for example ecmwf canadian meteorological center cmc fleet numerical meteorology and oceanography center fnmoc and icosahedral nonhydrostatic model icon dwd we believe that this approach can expand the applicability of post processing algorithms using neural networks and can

23973,the quality of metocean forecasts at longer forecast ranges has a significant impact on maritime safety and offshore operations a nonlinear ensemble averaging technique is demonstrated using neural networks applied to one year 2017 of global ocean wave ensemble forecast system gwes data provided by ncep post processing algorithms are developed based on multilayer perceptron neural networks nn trained with altimeter data to improve the global forecast skill from nowcast to forecast ranges up to 10 days including significant wave height hs and wind speed u10 nns are applied as an alternative to the typical use of the arithmetic ensemble mean em nn models are constructed using six variables sourced from 21 ensemble members plus latitude sin cos of longitude sin cos of time forecast lead time and gwes cycle the nn outputs are the residues of hs and u10 i e the difference from the em to the observations one hidden intermediate layer is evaluated in terms of the optimum number of neurons complexity to map the given problem the sensitivity test considered 26 different numbers of neurons 10 seeds for initial conditions and 3 equally divided datasets for a total of 780 nn experiments assessments using 2 507 099 paired satellite gwes fields show that a simple nn model with few neurons is able to reduce the systematic errors for short range forecasts while a nn with more neurons is required to minimize the scatter error at longer forecast ranges the novel method shows that one single nn model with 140 neurons is able to improve the error metrics for the whole globe while covering all forecast ranges analyzed the bias of the widely used em of gwes that varies from 10 to 10 for hs compared to altimeters can be reduced to values within 5 the rmse of day 10 forecasts from the nn simulations indicated a gain of two days in predictability when compared to the em using a reasonably simple post processing model with low computational cost keywords neural networks ensemble forecast non linear ensemble averaging wave modeling altimeter data 1 introduction accurate forecasts of surface winds and waves are essential for activities such as ship routing high risk maritime operations coastal management and alerts of extreme events extending wave forecast skill throughout longer forecast horizons requires multiple research initiatives from improved modeling for example incorporating atmosphere ocean coupling e g janssen et al 2002 to improved data assimilation methods such as coupled data assimilation penny et al 2017 while these improvements represent important benefits to the predictability of metocean variables deterministic forecasts are still limited in their usefulness for outlooks beyond one week due to the chaotic behavior of the atmosphere ocean wave coupled system for example as pointed out by lorenz 1963 using a simple model of the atmosphere using an ensemble of multiple forecasts can extend the range of skillful predictions often out to 10 days with the additional benefit of providing a measure of the uncertainty via the spread of predictions ensemble members the arithmetic ensemble mean em typically yields smaller forecast errors compared to the mean error of each individual member murphy 1988 which has been confirmed for both atmospheric ensemble forecasts zhou et al 2017 and wave ensemble forecasts cao et al 2009 alves et al 2013 since 1992 the european centre for medium range weather forecasts ecmwf and the u s national centers for environmental prediction ncep have produced operational ensemble forecasts saetra and bidlot 2004 investigated the quality of the ecmwf ensemble prediction system using buoy and satellite data an interesting improvement to ship routing using the ecmwf wave ensemble system was analyzed by hoffschildt et al 1999 the ncep atmospheric global ensemble forecast system gefs was recently assessed by zhou et al 2017 and the ncep global wave ensemble system gwes has been described by chen 2006 cao et al 2009 and evaluated by alves et al 2013 they found that after the day 5 forecasts the root mean square error of the ensemble mean becomes smaller than the control forecast however the general bias does not show any improvement as expected this feature has been confirmed by campos et al 2018b who calculated the systematic and scatter errors of 10 m wind speed u10 and significant wave height hs from ncep ensemble forecast using buoy measurements at longer forecast ranges beyond one week campos et al 2018b found an improvement of 20 on the scatter index of the em compared to the control run and no significant improvement on the systematic error nevertheless even with the benefits of the ensemble approach large forecast errors are still present beyond the day 7 forecasts demanding further post processing techniques zieger et al 2018 implemented a regional wave ensemble forecast system and developed a technique to bias correct the mean value using multivariate linear regression based on glahn and lowry 1972 durrant et al 2009 based on woodcock and greenslade 2007 developed an operational consensus forecast scheme that uses past model performance to bias correct and combine forecasts to produce an improved product at locations where recent observations are available for 24 hour forecasts their methodology produced improvements of 36 and 31 in rmse of hs and u10 compared to the mean raw model components following a similar idea harpham et al 2016 developed a bayesian statistical method that modifies the probabilities of ensemble forecasts based on recent performance of individual members against a set of observations these works are examples of bias correction methods which are mostly based on multivariate linear regression and estimation of dynamic weights applied to ensemble members moving to a nonlinear mapping our goal is to develop post processing algorithms based on neural networks nn trained with altimeter data to improve the ncep s gwes this approach enhances the traditional em to a nonlinear ensemble average that aims to reduce both the systematic and scatter errors of u10 and hs in our previous works campos et al 2017 2019b we introduced a nn technique to perform a regional nonlinear ensemble averaging based on buoy data in this work we generalize the previously developed technique to global scale forecasts using altimetry data we describe the neural network model in section 2 the global ensemble and observations as well as the data organizing and pairing are described in section 3 section 4 is dedicated to sensitivity tests and construction of neural network models investigating the complexity necessary to address the global mapping section 5 shows the results and provide a discussion about the benefits and shortcomings of the method and section 6 presents the final conclusions challenges and suggestions of next steps 2 nonlinear mapping using neural networks the assessments of the ncep ensemble forecast system performed by campos et al 2018b 2017 based on mentaschi et al 2013 draw attention to the multivariate and nonlinear aspects of the forecast error typically the interpretation of ensemble outputs is mostly based on the mean and standard deviation or spread of the ensemble members however use of the em assumes that a linear relationship between ensemble members is optimal while this relationship may in fact be strongly nonlinear particularly at longer lead times in order to address these nonlinear relationships we propose using feedforward nn models to produce an ensemble average as a post processing alternative trained with quality controlled observations a multilayer perceptron nn model mlp nn rumelhart et al 1986 has been selected due to its previous successes being a powerful universal mapping approximator hornik 1991 while being flexible and easy to implement on regression problems the mlp nn is a feed forward artificial nn that uses supervised learning and consists of three or more layers one input layer one or more hidden layers and one output layer in this study only one hidden layer is used though we vary the number of nodes to properly identify the minimum complexity and avoid over fitting the mlp nn implemented is based on the theory of haykin 1999 and implementation support of krasnopolsky 2013 eq 1 presents the mlp nn model which is built with hyperbolic tangent as the activation function 1 n n x 1 x 2 x n a b y q a q 0 j 1 k a q j h b j 0 i 1 n b j i x i q 1 2 m x i are the inputs y q the outputs a and b are the weights n and m are the numbers of inputs and outputs respectively the number of nodes neurons or hyperbolic tangents is given by k the optimization of parameters a and b is based on backpropagation training using gradient decent at each iteration the loss function is calculated as the square of the error obtained from the forward propagation of the inputs minus the observations which is then propagated backwards using the derivative of the activation function 1 tanh x 2 in order to correct the weights it has been verified that efficient optimization is obtained with the stochastic gradient decent described by kingma and ba 2014 chosen for the nn training the selection of a large and reliable set of measurements the number of iterations and the number of neurons are key aspects during the training process as a pre processing step a quality control is applied to exclude outliers and then input and output variables are rescaled between 0 and 1 according to eq 2 this process is later inverted after nn simulations 2 x i 0 1 x i x i m i n x i m a x x i m i n such nn models have gained increasing use in environmental problems examples for wave forecasting problems include sánchez et al 2018 concerning wave energy potential mandal and prabaharan 2006 for forecast of hs in india dixit and londhe 2016 for extreme hs simulations from hurricanes using a neuro wavelet technique berbić et al 2017 for short term predictions of hs among other applications described by krasnopolsky 2013 the first step towards the nonlinear ensemble averaging using nn was taken by campos et al 2017 who developed mlp nn models for two point wise locations on the east and west coasts of the united states trained with ndbc buoy data despite initial problems with excess noise and risk of over fitting a simple nn model with 11 nodes neurons and one hidden layer was effective in reducing the 5 day forecast errors of hs by 64 for bias and 29 for rmse rasp and lerch 2018 applied a similar neural network model for postprocessing ensemble weather forecasts of 2 m temperature at surface stations in germany being able to outperform benchmark postprocessing methods with low computational cost later developments by campos et al 2019b expanded the single point approach of campos et al 2017 to a regional modeling application introducing the spatial dimension into the nn using six ndbc buoys in the gulf of mexico 105 600 nns were built with different architectures and initial conditions in order to investigate the ability of nns to reduce scatter errors and systematic errors present in the gwes the most effective nn models of campos et al 2019b were found with 35 to 50 neurons in the hidden layer which improved the correlation coefficient of day 10 forecasts from 0 39 to 0 61 for u10 and from 0 50 to 0 76 for hs when comparing to the em we note that both campos et al 2017 2019b developed one independent nn per forecast time from 0 nowcast to 10 days upper limit of gwes and the training process was static based on one year of measurements and not dynamic or online as some of the references described before this means that once the model is trained the post processing algorithm and nn parameters are not modified even when recent observations become available unless a re training is applied as a follow up of campos et al 2019b our present study has two specific technical challenges 1 to expand the domain from a small basin gulf of mexico of campos et al 2019b to the whole globe and 2 develop a single nn model that can minimize the error at all forecast horizons from the nowcast out to 10 days and beyond fig 1 illustrates the first challenge where different wind and wave climates can be visualized through the correlation coefficient cc of u10 and hs locations in red indicate large cc where hs is usually high when surface winds are intense on the other hand locations in blue where cc is low often have relatively large waves without strong winds probably due to the passage of mature swells at trade winds zones fig 1 is a simple illustration of how the homogeneous climate within the gulf of mexico explored by campos et al 2019b compares to the whole globe explored in the present study this indicates the need for proper spatial modeling in the nn simulations and sufficient amount of observations during the training process in order to build a single best nn model to cover all forecast leads in global simulations we use observations of wind speed u10 and wave height hs covering the whole globe as provided by satellite altimeters as described in section 3 and consequently we use the same quantities as the output variables of the nns the inputs for the nn model include all of the variables that benefit the mapping which consists of input information with high correlation with outputs and verified physical meaning for each ensemble member plus spatiotemporal parameters such as location time and forecast lead time discussed in section 4 inspired by the gwes forecast of hurricane mathew in the east coast of the united states fig 2 campos et al 2017 proposed a slightly different setup of the nn outputs fig 2 shows the ability of the em of the day 5 gwes forecast in predicting an extreme event the first part of the storm was very well simulated while the second peak was overestimated by the forecast in this case the traditional em produces a skillful forecast for early part of the event implying no need for post processing intervention while the later part of the storm has a significant drop in skill indicated post processing is required as a result the suggestion of campos et al 2017 was to use nns to predict the anomaly or residue of the forecast i e the difference between the measurement and the em predicting the residue or residual has an advantage during the training process of not updating the nn parameters eq 1 during the backpropagation training when the em is already relatively accurate while reserving the largest updates to the weights a and b for the times when the em severely deviates from the observations this approach agrees with the paradigm that nn should be applied to nonlinear problems only krasnopolsky 2013 chpt 1 and 2 i e the linear part is adequately represented by the em while the nonlinear component is simulated by the nn through the prediction of the residue by using the residue predicted by the mlp nn combined with the em eq 1 is now embedded in eq 3 where the nonlinear ensemble averaging nem is finally calculated campos et al 2017 demonstrated the success of this approach for a range of percentiles including extreme events with fewer samples in the database the top percentiles are usually associated with larger errors campos et al 2018b that lead to larger updates of nn weights fig 3 illustrates the model selected as the basis of our global nn simulations and table 1 shows the nn inputs outputs and nn experiments described in detail in section 4 3 n e m e m n n r p 1 p 2 p n the hybrid system fig 3 uses the combination of the em with the nn prediction of the residue to obtain final estimates of u10 and hs which are then assessed against altimeter observations willmott et al 1985 provide a complete discussion about environmental model assessments using metrics to analyze the accuracy and precision of model results mentaschi et al 2013 present a recent valuable complement to this topic with a discussion about limitations of rmse and how it can be complemented by other metrics to have a reliable estimation of the systematic and scatter components of the error among the equations given by mentaschi et al 2013 we prefer to utilize normalized metrics since the model performance is assessed in a global domain including wind and wave climates with different severities thus three normalized error metrics are utilized to evaluate the results normalized bias nbias that measures the systematic error scatter index si that measures the scatter error and normalized rmse nrmse that combines the systematic and scatter components eqs 4 to 6 describe the dimensionless metrics selected where x is the altimeter data y is the forecast and σ x is the standard deviation of x the overbar indicates the arithmetic mean by using these three normalized metrics without units plots and tables of errors can be interpreted as ratios or percentage errors divided by 100 4 n b i a s i 1 n y i x i i 1 n x i 5 s i i 1 n y i y x i x 2 i 1 n x i 2 6 n r m s e i 1 n y i x i 2 i 1 n x i 2 s i 2 n b i a s 2 x 2 x 2 σ x 2 3 input data and observations we use one year of 2017 forecast data from the ncep global ensemble system and satellite observations selected for the same period the gwes was implemented in 2005 chen 2006 cao et al 2009 and is based on the third generation wave model wavewatch iii tolman 2016 the current gwes version alves et al 2013 used in the present paper runs a 10 day forecast with four cycles per day with a space time resolution of 0 5 and 3 h and produces ensemble forecasts using 20 gefs forced members plus a control member described by zhou et al 2017 winds and ice concentration are used as forcing fields from the gefs which was first implemented in 1992 toth and kalnay 1993 the gefs initialization scheme was recently replaced zhou et al 2017 from the breeding based ensemble transformation with rescaling etr to the ensemble kalman filter scheme enkf whitaker et al 2008 the space time resolution of surface winds from gefs is the same as gwes 0 5 and 3 h ice concentrations are obtained from ncep s automated ice analysis wu and grumbine 2013 note that perturbations are solely added to the atmospheric ensemble in gefs behrens 2015 and farina 2002 argue that atmospheric forecast models represent highly nonlinear dynamic systems that could generate chaotic forecasts due to small perturbations in the initial condition while perturbations of the initial state in wave models have small effects on the results therefore the wave ensemble integrates 21 independent simulations of the wave model that differ in the provided forcing conditions gwes only propagates to the wave spectra the perturbations added to the atmospheric model the quality controlled altimeter data used for training nn outputs were obtained from two sources aviso and nesdis the altimeter missions jason2 jason3 and saral were downloaded from aviso ftp area while cryosat2 was obtained from nesdis complete assessments of altimeter data can be found at queffeulou 2004 2012 2013 sepulveda et al 2015 and queffeulou and croizé fillon 2017 comparisons with buoys show that the altimeter estimate of hs is in general in agreement with in situ data with the differences having a standard deviation around 0 3 m depending on the satellite with a small overestimation at low hs and underestimation for high hs taking into account that level of uncertainty is much smaller than forecast errors altimeter data from the two sources above can be directly applied for the nn training after a quick additional quality control the along track altimeter data are organized and collocated into the regular grid of gwes using the kd tree algorithm and based on the methodology of young and holland 1996 and sepulveda et al 2015 considering the high sampling rate of the satellite track all measurements with a maximum space distance of 25 km and time distance of 0 5 h are allocated to each grid point lat lon at a specific time the multiple altimeter records within this cube of lat lon time are selected and a gaussian function applied to weight values by distance to the center point in order to give a single altimeter data matching the gwes grid point fig 4 illustrates the collocated altimeter data over the globe for the duration of the nn experiment furthermore two additional criteria are imposed to exclude satellite gwes matchups at shallow and intermediate waters or located close to the coast these criteria avoid increasing errors of altimeter data due to footprint averaging size and restrict the nn emulation to deep waters we use etopo1 bathymetry amante and eakins 2009 with 1 arc minute of resolution and a measure of distance from the coast with 0 04 degrees resolution from nasa s goddard space flight center database we select a minimum water depth of 490 m and minimum distance from the coast of 100 km applying these criteria a total count of 7 521 298 satellite gwes matchups between 60 s and 60 n are allocated to gwes grid points at 3 hourly time resolution for analysis of results the largest oceans are delimited using the world seas database iho 1953 containing a demarcation of oceans and seas giving 817 516 matchups of satellite gwes in the north atlantic 1 280 934 in the south atlantic 1 601 452 in the north pacific 2 175 888 in the south pacific and 1 645 508 in the indian ocean for single hindcast simulations the 7 521 298 matchups described before would consist of pairs of one vector of model variables see section 4 per altimeter value however there are two additional dimensions ensemble members and forecast time so each altimeter record is paired to a matrix exemplified by fig 5 the inclusion of forecast time paired to altimeter data must be applied with caution because the sequence of records at any specific location is made sparser by shifting satellite orbits for each altimeter measurement at any lat lon time we move backwards in time and select gwes predictions all valid at the same location and time for example taking the 24 hour forecast step of the preceding 1 day gwes cycle then the 48 hour forecast step of the preceding 2 day gwes cycle etc this process can be applied with the ncep cycle resolution of 6 h giving 41 sets of forecast leads within the time horizon of 10 days the matrix of 21 ensemble members per 41 forecast instants provides 861 model values that with an accurate forecast should be similar to the single satellite observation fig 5 exemplifies this matrix where on the nowcast gwes is performing very well for the first four forecast days gwes slightly overestimates the observations and beyond the 5th day there is a severe underestimation of the forecast that should be attenuated by the nn post processing model 4 neural network architecture and sensitivity tests the mlp nn models were constructed based on eqs 1 and 3 nn inputs include six variables 10 m wind intensity u10 significant wave height hs peak wave period tp mean wave period tm significant wave height of wind sea wsh and period of wind sea tws for each of 20 ensemble members plus the control member initial tests included only hs u10 and tp as nn inputs however after expanding the simulations to the whole globe the addition of tm wsh and tsw were found to provide valuable information about the wave spectra needed to differentiate mature swell from young wind sea wave generation from propagation zones and different wind and wave climates fig 1 zieger et al 2018 in their study of ensemble forecasts in australia confirmed the benefit of including wind sea features such as significant wave height and period of wind waves that improve the overall spectral information and the ensemble prediction the geographical space is represented with three additional nn inputs latitude and sine and cosine of longitude eq 7 the sine and cosine of time days are added as inputs in order to include an annual cycle and seasonal effects to the mapping presented in eq 8 furthermore forecast lead time is included varying from 0 to 10 days as well as gwes forecast cycle 0 6 12 18 this results in a total of 133 variables as the nn inputs 126 gwes variables 3 variables for location 2 for time and 2 variables for forecast lead time and cycle 7 l o n s i n sin 2 π l o n 360 l o n c o s cos 2 π l o n 360 8 t s i n sin 2 π t i m e 365 t c o s t cos 2 π t i m e 365 nns do not automatically understand periodic and cyclic variables if not stated for example time where month 1 comes after month 12 and hour 0 comes after 23 longitude 180 comes after 179 etc therefore sine and cosine had to be applied to time and longitude as presented by equations above increasing the number of variables the nn outputs are composed of two variables only the residues of u10 and hs presented by fig 3 the hidden or intermediate layer containing the hyperbolic tangents controls the complexity of the mapping the computational and functional complexity of the nn mapping n c of mlp nn 1 can be defined by eq 9 following krasnopolsky 2013 as in eq 1 n and m are the total numbers of inputs and outputs and k is the number of nodes neurons in one hidden layer once the nn inputs and outputs are defined and fixed the complexity is controlled by k we focus on identifying the most effective value for k which is problem and domain dependent the optimal n c for the nn global modeling is unknown so we conduct an experiment with several nn simulations with different number of neurons k the test aims to find a single nn model with the best configuration of the hidden layer and optimized parameters a and b 9 n c k n m 1 m a total of 26 different numbers of neurons are tested through independent nn simulations 2 5 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 90 100 110 120 130 140 150 160 180 200 250 300 350 400 450 and 500 ten different seeds for random initialization of a and b of eq 1 are used to estimate the sensitivity of the backpropagation training algorithm to the initial weights and to find better initial weights the dataset of 7 521 298 matchups of satellite gwes is randomly divided into three datasets where the nns are trained and assessed independently this allows a further analysis of the robustness of the nn model and reduces memory load during the computational costly training step the entire sensitivity test considers 26 different numbers of neurons 10 seeds and 3 datasets giving a total of 780 independent nns table 1 summarizes the nn architecture and nn simulations performed besides the data division a cross validation scheme with three cycles was applied to each dataset previously divided and independent to each other alternating indexes defined for training and testing by using the leave one out method in summary cross validation was applied three times where each one selected 2 9 of the entire dataset for training and 1 9 for testing this approach was selected to ensure that nn assessments are applied to records that were not used during training and combined to a sufficiently small number of neurons and iterations avoids over fitting over training and ensures better generalization results of sensitivity tests results involving nn simulation for the three different randomly selected datasets see previous paragraph are averaged since errors are very similar among them and then presented as a function of the number of neurons and plotted divided into training and test sets the systematic error of the em of gwes is around 3 written on top of the left column plots in fig 6 while the nns errors are bounded within 1 and 1 a very small error involving nn with both small and large number of neurons similar values of nbias are found for u10 and hs presented by fig 6 the scatter indexes si indicate better results for hs than u10 where the em has 24 5 of error for u10 and 21 for hs these values drop to 23 for u10 and 19 for hs when using nns a relative improvement that is smaller than the improvement found for nbias the evolution of the si with the number of neurons shows a minimum value that corresponds to more neurons than the same for nbias where a sharp decay is seen between 2 to 50 neurons these differences however are only 0 38 in the scatter error among various numbers of neurons the best results of nrmse which combines the scatter and systematic errors eq 6 shown in the right column of plots of fig 6 are found between 60 to 180 neurons but within a range of only 0 31 above 200 neurons the si and the nrmse start to increase again the difference between training and test sets is small fig 6 suggesting that there is no overtraining during the backpropagation training step however there is variation due to the use of different seeds such that the results tend to diverge above 200 neurons with increasing spread this indicates that the nn models might be over fitted and implies that the complexity of nn 9 is greater than needed for the three different metrics and two output variables the nn models have smaller errors than both the em and control member top of each plot in fig 6 thus from aforementioned analysis we conclude that the best nn models should have between 60 to 180 neurons at the intermediate layer however this result comes from the assessment integrated over the entire gwes forecast range of 10 days while errors increase significantly with forecast horizon which impacts the nn training fig 7 presents the same results as fig 6 but for three different forecast lead times day 0 nowcast day 5 and day 10 where each point related to a specific number of neurons is an average of 30 nns 10 seeds and 3 datasets the nrmse for hs reaches minimum at 80 and 90 neurons for different forecast leads for u10 on day 0 the sharp decay of the curve suggests the best results with 50 to 80 neurons and values above 90 have larger nrmse for day 5 a second minimum is found around 160 to 180 neurons the longest forecast range day 10 shows the best results between 120 and 180 neurons also indicating larger nrmse for nn with neurons equal or less than 110 therefore the increasing scatter error of the surface winds at longer forecast ranges is the main feature that requires more complex nns another characteristic to notice is the distance between the nn curves of training and test set on day 0 they are very close to each other while for day 5 and 10 the test set changes to larger nrmse than the training set indicating the greater difficulty of the nn in simulating longer forecast ranges the assessment of 780 nns averaged through the three different datasets 260 results presented can be further visualized into the two dimensional space of scatter and systematic error fig 8 all nns represented by the cloud of circles in fig 8 performed better than the em and control run red and cyan squares on the left plots for both types of errors systematic and scatter and indicates the success of the approach the systematic errors of hs and u10 presented by nbias are especially small between 2 and 2 while the scatter errors are between 19 and 23 the clouds of training and test points of fig 8 are close to each other so nns are not over fitted and have generalization capability the selection of the best nn model among the tests relies on a defined criterion assigning scores to each nn based on the error metrics the right plots of fig 8 provide a more detailed view of test set results where the dot size is proportional to the variance of si through the forecast range divided by the si i e nns with good results for the whole range of forecast have small points while nns that improved some forecast ranges but not others are depicted by points that have large diameters this last situation occurs mostly in nns with few neurons and high values of si at the top of the cloud of points of fig 8 based on these plots the best nns are expected to have more than 30 neurons and can simulate very well a wide range of forecast leads the decision about the best nn was based on three steps the first one restricted the nn results within a maximum systematic error of 0 5 including hs and u10 as nbias is very small for most of the nns a total of 326 nns of the 780 have absolute nbias of u10 smaller than 0 005 while for hs this amount is 294 the combined restriction for both variables leads to 144 nns with extremely small and therefore acceptable biases the second step sorted the arrays of nns error metrics building arrays in ascending order for each type of error with ids related to each nn model the third step looked at the top values of the rank best results of correlation coefficient cc and si for hs and u10 searching for the best nn that minimize the scatter errors of both waves and winds it has been verified that the top ranking nn models that minimize certain scatter error metric such as si also maximize the correlation coefficient which makes the final selection much easier three nns were identified with very similar values from which the best one was selected containing 140 neurons at the hidden layer although the goal of the post processing simulations is to prioritize hs the selection of optimum nns that also minimize the error of u10 is important since both output variables are correlated and the wave generation process depends of the quality of surface winds 5 results of global simulations and discussion once the best nn architecture and parameters have been determined the performance of the selected nn was evaluated using an independent set of altimeter data that was not included in the backpropagation training this includes 2 507 099 matchups of satellite gwes distributed over the whole globe figs 9 and 10 present global maps of systematic and scatter errors comparing the em with the nn nonlinear average the matchups are grouped in bins 61 latitudes and 181 longitudes within a radius of 2 to compute the error statistics for each location nbias of fig 9 shows a strong spatial dependence of gwes errors reflecting areas of occurrence of tropical and extra tropical storms where the atmospheric model data errors are expected to be larger than in other areas and regions in the tropical ocean exposed to swell systems that may either propagate extratropical storm wind field errors or indicate intrinsic wave model source term biases in mid and high latitudes the em tends to overestimate observed values from altimeters this is particularly evident in the southern hemisphere in the tropics the em tends to underestimate the observed values with an exception of area along the itcz in the pacific ocean the systematic error of the em varies from 10 to 10 at most locations the nonlinear ensemble average using nn reduces this bias to values within 5 the benefit is greater at mid latitudes dominated by extratropical cyclones where the nbias of the em can reach 12 for hs however errors along the equator in the eastern pacific ocean are not improved possibly due to the small correlation of hs and u10 as illustrated in fig 1 the global maps of si fig 10 indicate significant errors for both u10 and hs at extra tropical latitudes again reflecting areas where forcing errors are expected to be larger due to the occurrence of tropical and extra tropical storms or to the dominance of swells the hs maps present larger errors at western portions of the oceans and concerning the southern hemisphere the south atlantic ocean has larger errors than the indian and south pacific oceans si in general reaches up to 40 for u10 and 30 for hs the nn provided additional skill that is not restricted to specific locations but distributed over the globe comparing figs 9 and 10 it is possible to conclude that the relative improvement due to the nn on the si is smaller than the improvement found for nbias in addition for practical applications it is important to have the total rmse with the same unit as the significant wave height hs in meters combining both error components presented by fig 11 as a final global map we include the deterministic forecast control run to provide an overview of the progress associated with each step a significant improvement occurs moving from the control run to the ensemble mean em where the rmse at extra tropical locations is reduced by approximately 30 and confirms the success of the ensemble methodology described by zhou et al 2017 and alves et al 2013 the nn post processing simulation acts especially on the locations with large rmse at mid latitudes and provides an additional reduction of 20 at these locations so after the hybrid modeling neural network attached to the ensemble forecast illustrated by fig 3 and eq 3 almost the entire globe has average rmse of hs bound to one meter in order to further contribute to the spatial discussion of results table 2 divides the assessment in five ocean basins using the world seas database initially described the differences in performance among the oceans are very small and the nn is proven to be suitable for all parts of the globe table 2 indicates that the ensemble is adding bias to the control run which is greatly reduced by the nn in terms of scatter error the em significantly reduces the si of the control run by approximately 25 and the nn provides an additional small reduction of 5 to 10 of si values we do not divide the global assessment maps into several figures related to forecast lead days because it would reduce the total data volume of matchups at the bins over the globe therefore figs 9 and 10 as well as table 2 integrate the results over the 10 days forecast range and inevitably insert more weight into the analyses and comparisons involving longer lead times associated with larger errors the final fig 12 shows the error metrics as a function of the forecast lead time providing a meaningful assessment of the nonlinear wave ensemble averaging using nn a total of 61 149 matchups of satellite gwes per forecast time is utilized to compose the plots fig 12 shows that nbias is reduced to values between 0 to 2 throughout the whole range this improvement is especially important after the day 7 forecasts when the control run tends to underestimate and em tends to overestimate the observations the si plot indicates a small reduction of the error by the nn equally distributed over the lead times taking the right part of the si plot associated with the longest horizons the results of the nn on day 10 have the same error of the em on day 8 equal to 27 which represents an extension of 2 days in terms of predictability if the nn averaging is used eq 6 presents the combination of nbias and si into the nrmse also included in fig 12 the growth pattern is similar to the si plot which is expected after comparing the y axis of nbias and si plots that indicate much larger errors coming from the scatter component the correlation coefficient cc is the most challenging metric to improve but the nn model was able to slightly improve the values compared with the em especially at longer forecast lead times the comparison of plots in fig 12 allows one to have a valuable overview of the benefits and shortcomings of the nn post processing method the operational implementation of the post processing algorithm is simple once the nn parameters a b of eq 1 and normalization parameters eq 2 are obtained the simulation is straightforward following three steps 1 the inputs must be downloaded or linked from the ncep ensemble forecast system which are then normalized and reshaped to build the input array for the nn program 2 the nn simulation is run covering the latitude longitude and forecast time generating the global residue and 3 outputs invert the initial normalization the proper shape of the array is rebuilt and the residues are added to the em fields of hs and u10 to construct the final output file in our case in netcdf or grib2 format as described before the training process is the step that requires more computational power daily runs following gwes cycles however can be performed by single core processors 2 ghz taking approximately five minutes in python language we believe this might be further improved and time consumed can be reduced it is important to stress again that our methodology based on neural networks does not intend to replace the numerical modeling of the physical processes or the ensemble approach instead we have developed a framework maintaining the ensemble forecast as provided by ncep and including a soft computing neural network as a post processing step linking the traditional modeling with a machine learning algorithm that improves the ensemble mean trained with a large amount of altimeter data the post processing algorithm using multilayer perceptron neural networks is simple enough to be used as a bias correction to deterministic forecasts same methodology but with only one member however it is proved that ensemble forecasts significantly reduce the scatter errors at longer forecast ranges zhou et al 2017 campos et al 2019a so the best solution considering the hybrid modeling is to attach the neural network to outputs of ensemble forecast systems 6 conclusions a large set of experiments was conducted to develop neural networks to post process and bias correct operational ensemble wave forecasts where the target variable is primarily hs followed by u10 the main goal was to build a nn model trained with altimeter data able to calculate nonlinear ensemble averages that outperform the typical arithmetic ensemble mean applied to the whole globe and covering a forecast range of 10 days simplicity of post processing algorithms has been a priority during the project an analysis of 780 nns facilitated identifying an effective architecture and complexity of the problem as well as testing the generalization and the distribution of the error with forecast lead times latitudes and longitudes a previous study by campos et al 2019b focusing on the gulf of mexico found the best nn configurations with 35 to 50 neurons in the hidden layer expanding to our global simulation it was found that 60 to 180 neurons produce the best results the complexity of the nn models described by eq 9 necessary to address global nonlinear ensemble averages involves a deeper discussion that depends on the output variable of interest forecast range and the type of error it was shown that minimizing hs errors require fewer neurons around 80 than u10 more than 100 the same is valid for shorter and longer forecast ranges simpler nn models with 60 to 80 neurons produce the smallest errors in the nowcast while 120 neurons are needed when considering the day 10 forecasts overall simple nn models are able to reduce the systematic errors of hs at short range forecasts while nn models with more neurons are necessary to minimize the scatter error of u10 at longer forecast ranges after a limit around 200 neurons increasing the complexity of nn models resulted in larger errors and loss of generalization the best nn overall configuration was found to have 140 neurons at the hidden layer taking the results from one year of simulations 2017 we found that the nns are efficient in reducing global systematic errors the average nbias was reduced from an average of 3 5 for the em to less than 1 globally which was further confirmed to be valid in all the five oceans analyzed separately scatter errors were more difficult to reduce however the nns did provide a small improvement of si especially for hs the nrmse combines the systematic and scatter components of error eq 6 and confirms the effectiveness of the nonlinear ensemble average using global nn trained with altimeter data which was able to improve the nrmse throughout the whole range of forecasts using the nn based nonlinear averaging the day 10 forecasts have the same nrmse as the day 8 forecasts for the arithmetic ensemble mean a gain of two forecast days in predictability we believe that the methodology described can be successfully extended to even longer forecast ranges which requires a new setup of the operational wave ensemble forecast of ncep noaa that nowadays is limited to 10 days further we believe that integrating the nn methods with coupled atmosphere ocean wave forecasts and coupled data assimilation penny and hamill 2017 penny et al 2017 may further extend this prediction capability as well as introducing wave parameters from spectral partitions into the nn inputs which could benefit lower latitudes with multiple distant swells in terms of future developments besides the extension of forecast horizon the construction of neural network based ensembles is a promising example of a growing trend to incorporate machine learning into weather forecasting boukabara et al 2019 the criterion of selecting the best nn among the tests led to the choice of a single nn whereas krasnopolsky and lin 2012 showed that multiple nn simulations developing an ensemble of nns produced successful results for precipitation forecasts in the united states specific nn ensembles suitable for extreme wave conditions can also be developed in the future following the track of the storms as performed by campos et al 2018a or even building nn members trained for tropical cyclones which represent a unique family of events our study focused on large basins in deep water future nn developments are needed to cover coastal areas lakes small seas and locations close to the arctic influenced by sea ice our last suggestion and plan are to include multi model ensembles in the nn post processing algorithm introducing more input variables into the nns in addition to the ncep ensemble members for example ecmwf canadian meteorological center cmc fleet numerical meteorology and oceanography center fnmoc and icosahedral nonhydrostatic model icon dwd we believe that this approach can expand the applicability of post processing algorithms using neural networks and can significantly improve wind and wave forecast with relative low computational cost credit authorship contribution statement ricardo martins campos conceptualization data curation formal analysis

23974,in this paper we explore the secondary flows in the danish straits using observations and numerical simulations performed with the unstructured grid hydrodynamic model schism covering the north sea and baltic sea the straits are resolved on scales of up to 100 m given that large scale atmospheric variability dominates the transport in these straits we focus on the processes with subtidal time scales similarities and differences between the in and outflows in the straits and flood and ebb flows in estuaries are analyzed contrary to the tidal straining in estuaries the danish straits feature substantial differences in the stratification stability during the outflow and inflow phases with a resolution of 100 m new transport and mixing pathways that were previously unresolved appear fundamental to the strait dynamics the variety of the strait morphology leads to high variability in the appearance of secondary circulation helical cells often with a horizontal extension of 1 km develop in the deep parts of the channels a comparison between the high resolution simulation and a simulation with a coarse grid of 500 m in the straits suggests that the coarser resolution overestimates the stratification and misrepresents the transport balance the axial velocities and transport through the sound are underestimated by 12 these differences are explained by the missing secondary circulation when the coarse resolution is used approximately two grid points per cell instead of ten grid points per cell in the fine resolution model along with the resulting changes in mixing along the straits in conclusion the use of ultrafine resolution grids is essential to adequately resolve secondary flow patterns and two layer exchange thus the problems caused by the failure to resolve the secondary circulation in straits appear similar to the problems caused by the failure to resolve mesoscale eddies in ocean models 1 introduction straits connecting estuarine basins with an open ocean or a more saline sea are typically characterized by a two layer exchange flow with an upper layer freshwater transport of low salinity water toward the more saline basin and a compensatory transport of saline bottom water this situation is similar to the known estuarine circulation hansen and rattray 1966 however while the alternating circulation in estuaries is largely dependent on tides the alternating inflow outflow regimes in straits are predominantly driven by changes in atmospheric forcing examples of such straits are the bosporus strait stanev et al 2017 and the north sea baltic sea transition zone nbtz fig 1 in the nbtz surface water from the baltic sea in the long term mean propagates in the northward direction overlying saline bottom water originating from the north sea jakobsen 1995 stanev et al 2015 however the direction of the along strait velocity component alters between net inflow from the saltier side towards the fresher side hereafter taken as the positive direction or net outflow negative direction depending on the wind and atmospheric pressure in tidally dominated estuaries vertical stratification typically increases during the ebb tide outflow due to a mechanism that is known as tidal straining in the estuarine literature simpson et al 1990 during flood tide inflow the process of straining acts reversely and reduces stratification given the overall similarities between estuaries and straits connecting ocean basins the expectation is that the atmospherically driven exchange flows in straits are subject to a similar straining mechanism as the exchange flows in estuaries at sub tidal time scales outflows are expected to stratify the water column with vertical shearing of the horizontal velocities while inflows are expected to destratify the water column tending towards well mixed conditions one goal of this study is to clarify the assumption of analogous along channel and secondary dynamics between estuaries and straits it is important to recognize that straits allow two way transport at both ends of the channel along channel flow is associated with flow in the perpendicular direction known as secondary circulation lerczak and geyer 2004 in bending channels given vertical density differences secondary circulation typically develops as a helical trajectory of the three dimensional flow pattern rozovskii 1957 chant 2002 2010 in estuaries the channel curvature coriolis deflection and differential advection of buoyancy drive across channel currents chant 2002 2010 secondary flows can be indirectly perceptible to the human eye such as in the case of laterally converging flows that accumulate foam along the channel axis as reported by nunes and simpson 1985 lerczak and geyer 2004 demonstrated the importance of interactions between along channel and cross channel dynamics due to the latter s influence on along channel density gradients becherer et al 2015 suggested that lateral circulation contributes substantially to estuarine exchange flows however due to missing spatial and temporal coverage in observations and a lack of focus on the lateral direction knowledge of secondary flows in the straits in particular in the danish straits is insufficient although the associated theoretical ideas are not new garrett et al 1993 garrett 2004 considering that the lateral circulation in estuaries is strongly affected by local morphology pein et al 2018 in the present study we present a numerical model study of hydrodynamics in the nbtz aiming to gain more insight into lateral processes and their appearance in realistic ocean straits as well as the feedbacks between along channel and secondary dynamics in the nbtz the flow direction alternates irregularly manifesting a principal resemblance to the tidal circulation in estuaries usually during periods dominated by strong currents the flow in the straits is unidirectional similar to two layer flow driven by gravitational convection in tidal estuaries zheng and weisberg 2004 currents in straits are also two directional given that the vertically integrated transport decreases below a critical value stanev et al 2017 2018 thus the different secondary circulation regimes in the nbtz straits are expected to be similar to those in tidal estuaries and this expectation will be scrutinized in the present study to the best of our knowledge the lateral circulation in the narrow straits connecting the baltic sea and north sea has not been reported based on observations umlauf and arneborg 2009 observed a persistent transverse circulation associated with a gravity current passing through a channel after the flow exited the straits the lateral circulation in the sound one of the straits connecting the north sea and baltic sea was documented by stanev et al 2015 using results from numerical simulations they illustrated the importance of the lateral transport of momentum to the vertical mixing of waters from different ocean basins however the horizontal resolution of the straits in their work 1 km was not sufficient to adequately resolve the lateral circulation in many estuaries the lateral flow is an order of magnitude smaller than the flow in the axial direction lerczak and geyer 2004 furthermore the helical flow which manifests as a single or double cell secondary circulation pattern rhoads and kenworthy 1998 is associated with strong vertical motion and mixing pein et al 2018 the helical flow pattern is crucial for the conservation of flow momentum as well as for tracer transport because momentum is neatly exchanged between the axial and perpendicular directions becherer et al 2015 pein et al 2018 simulations can be biased if this helical cell structure is not resolved in numerical models the consequences are expected to be similar to those in numerical simulations of ocean circulation that do not resolve baroclinic eddies we consider the model skill in representing the secondary dynamics a crucial test for the quality of models with respect to the representation of 4d strait dynamics therefore in the present study we demonstrate the appearance of secondary circulation using both observations from field data and numerical modeling a large portion of the data are derived from simulations using the semi implicit cross scale hydroscience integrated system model schism zhang et al 2016a b which is an unstructured grid model stanev et al 2018 provided an extensive review on modeling in the nbtz along with an analysis of the skill of schism in resolving the interbasin exchange in the present study we continue the analysis of stanev et al 2018 but focus on secondary circulation the structure of the paper is as follows section 2 addresses the numerical model and the basics of physical oceanography in the studied region based on the model simulations section 3 addresses the intercomparison between observations and model results section 4 presents an analysis of the secondary circulation and its main characteristics in the sound and great belt section 5 discusses the performance of the model using an ultrafine resolution in the narrow straits and the impact of this resolution on the properties of strait exchange this section is followed by the conclusions in section 6 2 the numerical model and methods 2 1 the model area and rationale an extensive review of the hydrodynamics in the nbtz and the numerical modeling of these hydrodynamics with schism can be found in zhang et al 2016a and stanev et al 2018 therefore we only briefly summarize the most relevant knowledge for the present study and refer the reader to the above cited works for further details and references one important focus of previous works was the oceanographic conditions in the interconnected basins that is the north sea and the baltic sea and the role of strait exchange in their dynamics the model area addressed here see fig 1 is the same as the model area in the above studies three straits i e the little belt the great belt and the sound connect the north sea and baltic sea the little belt with a width of 1 km is the narrowest passage the great belt is the widest strait width of 15 km and the width of the sound is 4 km these narrow passages efficiently filter the tides the major part of mechanical energy to the south of the straits in the baltic sea is provided by the wind and atmospheric pressure since these straits are shallow the dominant dynamic balance is between the pressure gradient and friction the transports in the great belt and sound correlate well with each other in a nonlinear manner stanev et al 2015 furthermore the transport rate between the great belt and the sound of 2 7 is not linearly proportional to the ratio of the cross sectional areas of the narrowest sections of the great belt and sound stanev et al 2018 overall the water transport in the sound is small compared to its cross sectional area revealing the strong frictional control in this strait the vertical mixing in the sound particularly in the area of the drogden sill section t s3 in fig 1b strongly affects the stratification and propagation of gravity currents into the baltic sea since secondary circulation is a major factor determining mixing in the straits chant 2010 the present study also addresses the capability of relatively coarse grid models to resolve this circulation adequately this is important when developing adequate physical parameterizations in the nbtz for models with suboptimal resolution in the straits 2 2 brief description of the numerical model setup and experiments in this study we use the same setup as that used by stanev et al 2018 which was a further development of the model presented by zhang et al 2016a these previous works focused on model validation the impact of resolution the role of atmospheric forcing in interbasin exchange and major inflows and the axial two layer water transport in the individual straits by using unstructured grids we avoid two fundamental problems of structured grid approaches in addressing cross scale processes from the strait to basin scale 1 one way nesting techniques as these techniques are not appropriate when simulating the dynamics of interconnected basins and 2 insufficient horizontal resolution which becomes a challenge when simulating narrow straits and connected basins in one model the hydrodynamic model schism uses a hybrid finite element and finite volume approach to solve the primitive equations and implicit techniques for terms that set stringent stability constraints e g cfl the eulerian lagrangian method is applied for momentum advection the model is hydrostatic and uses the boussinesq approximation the model domain covers the north and baltic seas with a resolution of up to 100 m in the narrow straits connecting the two basins the minimum grid side length is 80 m in the little belt this model accurately resolves the interbasin exchange this ultrafine resolution is the most important difference between the present model and other models that resolved the straits with a resolution of 600 m gräwe et al 2015 mohrholz et al 2015 in the open sea parts of the baltic sea and north sea an essentially uniform resolution of 3 km is specified the vertical grid uses a variable number of sigma layers and a shaved cell technique to eliminate staircases zhang et al 2015 see stanev et al 2018 give more details about the model grid the shaved cells also shut down diapycnal mixing and reduce the pressure gradient errors the parameterizations described in the above cited earlier publications contribute to an adequate resolution of the baroclinic instability and the frictionally dominated dynamics in the straits data from the 7 km resolution cosmo eu model of the german weather service dwd are used as atmospheric forcing these data include the hourly wind atmospheric pressure air temperature dew point temperature and cloud cover values the freshwater fluxes from 34 rivers are prescribed from the pan european hydrological predictions for the environment ehype product of the swedish meteorological and hydrological institute smhi at the open boundaries data from the copernicus product http marine copernicus eu are used these data include hourly values of elevation horizontal velocity salinity and temperature the analyzed period of integration is from march 1 2014 to november 24 2016 to study the dependence of the representation of two layer exchange in the straits on the horizontal resolution stanev et al 2018 performed an additional experiment in which the resolution in the nbtz was coarsened to the finest value of 500 m this experiment is referred to as coarse while the above described experiment with a higher resolution is referred to as fine we use results from the coarse experiment to analyze the dependence of the secondary circulation in the straits on the resolution in this context it is important to note that although the areas of the narrowest cross sections are almost the same in the two models with 100 m and 500 m resolutions the same topography is used in both models the transport rates change substantially the explanation for this result given in stanev et al 2018 is that the use of a fine resolution allows us to resolve the velocity shear along the straits coasts in section 5 we will demonstrate the impact of the different resolutions on the straits secondary circulation 2 3 the lateral momentum balance equation to understand secondary flow patterns and to assess the importance of different processes to the total momentum budget we analyze the lateral momentum equation on cross sections through the straits to provide the necessary physical background we present the fundamental equation and relevance of its different terms following nidzieko et al 2009 the lateral momentum equation in a curvilinear polar coordinate system is as follows 1 u n t u s 2 u s 2 r s u s u n s u s u n s g ρ 0 z 0 ρ z n d z z 0 ρ z n d z f u s u s τ n ρ z τ b n ρ h here u s is the streamwise velocity u n is the lateral stream normal velocity u z is the vertical velocity s denotes the along stream direction n is the stream normal direction z is the vertical direction with positive indicating upward and t is the time the parameter r s is the streamline curvature radius the coriolis parameter is f 10 4 s 1 g 9 8 m s 2 is the gravitational acceleration and h is the local water depth the water density is ρ ρ 0 ρ where ρ 0 1000 kg m 3 is a reference density and ρ indicates the time variable density perturbations furthermore the shear stress in the lateral direction is τ n and at the bottom is τ b n overbars x denote vertical means thus barotropic contributions to the lateral momentum balance are not considered in the following analysis lacy and monismith 2001 by taking a time average of eq 1 in the inflow phase and outflow phase separately we obtain 2 u n t u s 2 u s 2 r s centrifugal acceleration u s u n s u s u n s advection g ρ 0 z 0 ρ z n d z z 0 ρ z n d z baroclinic pressure gradient f u s u s coriolis u n u z z τ b n ρ h friction here the term on the left hand side indicates local acceleration on the right hand side the first term is the contribution due to inertial forces associated with the streamline curvature this term is negligible for an ideally straight channel r s becomes infinite but can strongly contribute to the lateral momentum balance for a bended channel kalkwijk and booij 1986 pein et al 2018 moreover smaller topographic obstacles in the channel and other changes in geometry cause curvature of the streamline and induce lateral momentum which becomes more important with increasing stratification geyer 1993 the second term on the right hand side of eq 2 describes the acceleration due to the streamwise advection of lateral momentum this term reflects upstream influences on the lateral momentum and how the local situation differs from them nidzieko et al 2009 found that this term can be important especially where abrupt changes in curvature occur the third term is the acceleration due to lateral density gradients because advective velocities in the center of the channel exceed those in near shore area the along stream density gradient is translated into lateral density gradients this leads to the formation of two counterrotating secondary circulation cells one on each side of the channel the fourth term is the coriolis deflection of streamwise flow this term depends directly on the flow velocity li et al 2014 found that the influence of the coriolis deflection of streamwise flow increases with the channel width leading to the formation of a single cell secondary circulation the last term is the response of the system to the driving terms via friction which assumes that the reynolds stress plays the dominant role in balancing the former driving terms 3 model performance the two layer interbasin exchange 3 1 model validation here the observational data set described by stanev et al 2018 is compared with model simulations with a focus on the lateral currents the data were collected by the danish meteorological institute dmi at two adcp stations in the danish straits these stations were o v 55 207542 n 11 086632e at vengeancegrund in the great belt and o d at drogden fyr 55 536380 n 12 711413e in the sound see fig 1 for their positions the lengths of available data series differ between the two stations the intercomparison in fig 2 is for september 2014 may 2015 which is the period of observations in the sound the data in fig 2 and in the following analyses are de tided by taking a 24 hour running average results using data which are not de tided are shown for comparison in the supplementary material the variability of the axial velocity of the observations and simulations compare reasonably well fig 2a c the velocity maxima in the sound are slightly overestimated in the model however the statistics of the model and observation data agree reasonably well table 1 for the axial velocities the root mean square rms error is relatively small 0 38 m s 1 compared to the large amplitudes of the currents typically order of 1 m s 1 the correlation between the simulated and observed velocities is good 0 90 at the three depths measured at the stations see also table 1 the simulations and observations show less agreement in the lateral velocities fig 2b d than in the axial velocities at drogden sill the maximum correlation coefficient is only 0 43 at the surface and decreases with increasing depth table 1 at station o v the correlation increases from 0 60 at the surface to 0 68 at a 5 m depth comparing the two stations figs 2b and 4d reveals that lateral flow in the shallow o d station is very weak so small discrepancies strongly affect the correlation with observations in contrast the magnitude of the lateral flow variability at station o v is much larger than that at station o d this stronger signal is resolved by the model which is a motivation to analyze the secondary flow in depth 3 2 basic characteristics of the circulation in the sound in this section we assess how the model replicates the axial flow the associated salinity distribution and the density stratification we focus primarily on the sound because it has narrower passages than the great belt and provides a greater challenge for the horizontal resolution we investigate the characteristics of the flow on transect t sa during two selected periods 1 a period of net transport into the baltic sea 25 30 october 2014 and 2 a period of net transport from the baltic sea to the north sea 12 17 november 2014 the two periods while not representative of extreme conditions were chosen because the de tided i e 24 hour mean net transport is unambiguously in one direction throughout each period and the periods fall within the time window of available observational current data furthermore transect t sa follows the thalweg of the strait blue line in fig 1b 3 2 1 inflow conditions the salinity distribution fig 3a b and baroclinic axial velocity fig 3e f show a clear two layer structure in the sound to better visualize the vertical structure of velocity the local vertical mean values fig 3c d are subtracted from the axial velocity in fig 3e f the subtracted mean velocity clearly features two maxima minima associated with the narrowest and shallowest passages of the sound to quantify the rates of the stabilizing effect of density stratification and the destabilizing effect of velocity shear the gradient richardson number 3 r i g ρ 0 ρ z u s z 2 u n z 2 is presented in fig 3g h the black isoline is r i 0 25 showing the critical value below which the flow becomes unstable during inflow most of the section and water column manifest stable conditions fig 3a g values of ri 0 25 appear only in the bottom boundary layer and in the near surface layer near helsingborg km 25 t s1 around the island of ven km 45 and over the drogden sill km 90 the ri values are relatively low because of the enhanced mixing in the narrow passages and over the sill following transect t sa from the kattegat the baroclinic flow is directed southward near the surface with a maximum velocity reaching 0 5 m s 1 at approximately km 35 while a compensating flow northward directed is observed near the bottom fig 3e further south the core of the southward flow is displaced from the surface layer into intermediate depths at km 30 and then upon approaching the drogden sill propagates upslope this upslope transport pattern is explained by the channel topography which constrains the flow at the drogden sill the core of the baroclinic southward flow occupies the upper two thirds of the water column immediately behind the sill the high salinity water from the north sea follows the bottom slope as a gravity current the highest southward velocities mean of 0 37 m s for this period are observed at 5 10 m above the bottom at km 190 the bottom slope decreases and the gravity current slows down 3 2 2 outflow conditions during the outflow phase saltier water in the kattegat is pushed northward by the brackish baltic sea water masses fig 3b building a sharp density gradient near km 25 north of km 25 salinities are greater than 25 psu everywhere while southward of km 25 the salinity does not exceed 20 psu while the inflow situation demonstrates a clear pycnocline vertical stratification the density contrast during outflow conditions is mostly horizontally oriented the salinity appears relatively well mixed over most of the considered transect especially in the top 15 m compare figs 3a and 3b one exception is the area north of the salinity front where the vertical stratification is well pronounced the velocity shear is quite different under inflow and outflow conditions compare figs 3e and 3f the highest baroclinic northward velocities during the outflow event local mean velocities as shown in fig 3d are subtracted are found at the surface just north of the salinity front fig 3f close to the narrowest section of the sound there is a clear correlation in the northernmost part of the transect between the salinity stratification and the two layer exchange low salinity and northward transport at the surface and vice versa in the bottom layer this correlation is reminiscent of the estuarine circulation it seems counterintuitive that the richardson number ri is lower during the outflow phase than during the inflow phase compare figs 3g and 3h since this contradicts the process of tidal straining in estuaries a common expectation is that surface inflow of less saline baltic sea water should increase the density stratification and consequently the buoyancy term in eq 3 obviously the effect of the reversal of the flow direction due to atmospheric variability on stratification destratification is different from the effect of tides on the straining of isopycnals in a tidal dominant estuarine environment south of the drogden sill values of ri 0 25 are typically found at depths shallower than 5 15 m and the surface waters above these depths are well mixed notice that in the outflow period values of ri 0 25 are also at the bottom one exception is in the area of narrow section furthermore upper and bottom layers with low ri numbers merge at the shallowest depth drogden sill at km 80 100 which is primarily caused by the reduced density there north of the sill the entrainment of salty north sea water from the bottom quickly re establishes stability in the water column ri in the bottom layer increases again the contradiction between the analyzed data along the sound transect and observations from estuaries where the flood destabilizes the water column can be explained as follows this strait has a shallow sill and deepens in both directions from the sill towards the two connected ocean basins the shallow sill depth of only 8 m effectively limits the through flow during outflow events and thus also features weakened stratification north of the narrow section the two layer flows resemble estuarine circulation thus the mouth of the baltic sea is north of the narrow section the area between the narrow section and the sill determines most of the specificities of sound dynamics 3 2 3 temporal variability both periods described above are part of longer periods of net inflow or outflow to gain a full picture of temporal changes two stations s2 and s4 are selected to show the variability of vertical salinity profiles fig 3i j these locations are illustrated on top of fig 3a h the evolution of the salinity at stations s2 and s4 named after their proximity to transects t s2 and t s4 see fig 1 shows increasing and decreasing salinities at both sites during the inflow and outflow periods respectively at station s2 north of the drogden sill the water column is relatively well mixed the individual inflow and outflow events can be easily identified by the high and low salinity values at the shallower station s4 south of the drogden sill the surface salinity also remains low during the inflow phases the column gradually becomes more vertically homogeneous only during the outflow phases this indicates that the vertical stratification to the south of the sill is due to gravity flow of high salinity water near the bottom under outflow conditions vertical mixing dominates thus features similar to well stratified estuarine plumes can be found only in the kattegat north of the straits the along channel profiles of sea surface height ssh and sea surface and bottom salinity sss and bs respectively averaged for the whole run reveal a situation that is typical in estuaries fig 4a b c the ssh in the arkona basin is 8 cm higher than the ssh to the north of the narrow section most of the changes occur between the sill and the narrow section an abrupt change in the variability pattern of ssh fig 4d appears at the drogden sill and is identified by a discontinuity at km 100 as shown in fig 4g in the first 100 km of this section sss and bs decrease rapidly with distance from the kattegat fig 4b c to the south of the drogden sill the along channel gradients of ssh and sss are small figs 4d f are zoomed versions of fig 10 of stanev et al 2018 in the nbtz they feature a sequence of several major baltic inflows mbi e g in december 2014 or in late 2015 notably not all anomalies of sea level are associated with mbis e g the long term positive ssh anomaly in 2016 fig 4d but only those during which the trends of sea level on both sides of the straits oppose each other this is illustrated by the mbi in october november 2014 fig 4g when the ssh from the arkona basin to the drogden sill is lower than that in the kattegat this event is followed by inflow over the entire water column as identified by the high salinity anomalies for the same period fig 4h i although the slope of the salinity anomaly contours is unidirectional in the bottom layer fig 4i this slope changes in the surface layer fig 4h in result the gravity current propagates to the south the salinity signal at the sea surface propagates in both directions the sss and bs show the largest changes between the narrow section and the sill fig 4b c the area of the strongest horizontal salinity gradient migrates between the narrow section during outflow conditions and the sill during inflow conditions the bottom pattern fig 4i shows a clear southward propagation in the direction of the arkona basin this event is very clear during the inflow period at the end of 2014 mbi the respective sss signal as well as other strong sss changes appears at the same time as the bs signals however unlike the bottom signals they do not propagate much farther beyond the sill this asymmetry between the sss and bs is fundamental for the vertical overturning south of the sill 4 the two layer exchange in the sound below we analyze the averaged simulations under inflow and outflow conditions specified in section 3 at four cross sections fig 5 the cross sections are situated at the narrow passage near helsingborg south of ven island at the drogden sill and at the southern entrance into the sound km 24 51 90 and 127 respectively along transect t sa fig 1 3 in the figures the western shore is always on the left hand side 4 1 the axial flow during the inflow period the sound experiences net southward water transport at all cross sections fig 5a at the northernmost transect t s1 the channel is narrowest with a width of only 5 2 km fig 1 but reaches a maximum depth of 32 m here the axial velocity attains its maximum value of 0 8 m s 1 at the surface near the center of the channel fig 5a upper left panel transect t s2 is wider 14 8 km than transect t s1 and has a maximum depth of 40 m the flow is much slower at t s2 than at t s1 and features three local extrema all at depths of 4 12 m fig 5a upper right panel the weakest of the extrema 0 32 m s 1 is at 4 m depth in the shallow western part of the transect km 4 7 the other two extrema are over the western and eastern slopes of the narrow deep channel of the section km 10 and 11 3 at 12 and 11 m depth reaching values of 0 44 and 0 39 m s 1 respectively in the upper eastern corner of the transect the axial velocity features a counter current minimum 0 3 m s 1 transect t s3 at the drogden sill is the shallowest transect with a maximum depth of 8 m the transect width is 14 3 km the small cross section area results in a strong and unidirectional axial flow fig 5a middle panel the flow here is split into two branches one branch is at km 1 2 at the western coast and the other branch is at km 8 these branches have maximum velocities of 0 84 m s 1 and 0 94 m s 1 respectively note that the maximum velocities in this transect are observed in the subsurface layers unlike the case of the narrow section which has approximately the same section area transect t s4 with a maximum depth of 22 m and a width of 23 5 km features the largest cross sectional area the inflow of t s4is restricted to the deeper western part of the transect and has a maximum velocity of 0 73 m s 1 at 13 m depth km 4 fig 5a bottom panel in contrast the eastern side and most of the surface area of the transect feature flow in the opposite direction with a minimum velocity of 0 2 m s 1 at the surface at km 11 5 this pattern is in good qualitative and quantitative agreement with the observations of umlauf and arneborg 2009 on the gravity current passing through a channel see their fig 8a under outflow conditions the largest axial speeds are found at the surface fig 5b the axial velocity at t s1 reaches a maximum of 1 43 m s 1 in the middle of the transect km 2 5 fig 5b upper left panel similarly at t s2 the fastest flow occurs near the center km 9 5 but due to the larger cross sectional area of t s2 than of t s1 the velocity reaches only 0 75 m s 1 fig 5b upper right panel here a southward counterflow of denser water is present in the deep channel maximum 0 1 m s 1 the flow at t s3 is split into three branches featuring local extrema of 1 14 m s 1 1 18 m s 1 and 1 03 m s 1 at km 1 9 km 8 1 and km 12 8 respectively fig 5b middle left panel at t s4 the flow features two surface intensified extrema of 0 39 m s 1 and 0 48 m s 1 at km 8 7 and km 20 6 respectively fig 5b bottom panel 4 2 the stabilizing effect of density and destabilizing effect of velocity shear under inflow conditions all four transects across the sound are dynamically stable ri 0 25 except for the shallow mixed surface layers and the well developed turbulent bottom layer fig 6a only in the eastern part of t s4 is ri 0 25 at all depths fig 6a bottom panel note that in this area salinity is very low due to outflowing baltic sea water compared to the inflow period the outflow period demonstrates reduced ri in most of the water column at all transects fig 6b however in the near bottom region of the deep channels t s2 and t s4 ri is larger in the outflow period than in the inflow period here the fresher outflow slides over more saline water that remains in the deep layers also note the countercurrents at t s2 and t s4 fig 5b such that a strong vertical density gradient dominates over the relatively weak velocity shear from the above it follows that the outflow period is characterized by a turbulent jet reaching a depth of up to 14 m at t s4 fig 6b bottom panel this jet extends along the entire strait as a surface intensified flow reaching the channel bottom in the area of ts 1 sound proper and drogden sill fig 6b middle left panel north of the sill the influence of the saline north sea water becomes stronger and the mixed surface layer shoals towards the north 1 5 m at t s2 and less than 1 m at t s1 in fig 3b h the overall weakening of the dynamic stability during the outflow phase relative to the inflow phase is in contrast to the tidal straining simpson et al 1990 observed in tidally dominated estuaries but is more similar to estuaries that are fresh water dominated cheng et al 2013 nonetheless there are four fundamental differences between the straits of the nbtz and a typical estuary a the irregularity of forcing a tidal estuary is usually characterized by fixed and perpetually altering flood and ebb periods however in a strait the outflow phase is largely independent of the previous inflow phase and vice versa the phase durations and volume fluxes are subject to the irregularities of atmospheric influences b the magnitude of the net inflow is comparable with that of the two way exchange in the case presented here the outflow phase is characterized by much larger along channel velocities than the inflow phase by approximately a factor of 2 which leads to a much stronger velocity shear quadratic dependency and associated decrease in the gradient richardson number c the geometry of the strait is different with ocean basins at both ends a simplified strait can be described as two funnels connected at their narrow ends representing the location of the sill or narrow section while a typical estuary resembles a single funnel connecting a river narrow end to the ocean thus the processes occurring on the fresher side of a sill may not have counterparts in an estuary d the time scales are longer tides usually have a semidiurnal or diurnal periodicity leaving only few hours for the change from inflow to outflow in straits the intervals of constant or predominant net transport in one direction can be much longer than a few hours e g determined by the synoptic scales in the atmosphere this allows for much farther displacements of water parcels and a stronger adjustment in the stratification in our case b and c together allow for the effective dispersion of saline water in the gravity flow south of the sill rendering most of the water column between t s4 and t s3 weakly stratified fig 3b j similarly north of the sill the long time period of net transport in one direction allows for much of the saline water to be flushed out to the north of the narrow passage at helsingborg as well as a strong reduction in the vertical density gradients south of t s1 fig 3b i 5 the secondary circulation 5 1 analysis of the lateral momentum budget in this section we examine in detail the secondary circulation first addressing the temporal means of driving terms during given inflow and outflow periods for this purpose the individual terms introduced in eq 2 are analyzed using cross section t s1 as an example we assess the structures and relative importance of the driving terms the evolution term is not shown because for the relatively long period of integration it is small compared to the other terms fig 7 shows the transverse distribution of four individual accelerating terms at t s1 under inflow conditions the difference in the aspect ratio of t s1 here compared to the previous figures is explained by the need to well illustrate the vertical patterns of driving forces while in figs 5 6 and 9 a comparable scaling of all sections is preferable the lateral acceleration due to the pressure gradient fig 7a and the advection of lateral momentum fig 7b are indicative of a quadrupole pattern in the upper 20 m of the water column these patterns suggest the convergence of lateral flows at the surface and divergence of lateral flows at mid depths resulting in two helical cells a clockwise rotating cell west of the thalweg and a counterclockwise rotating cell east of the thalweg the coriolis force fig 7c is indicative of a single cell driving the lateral flow towards the west near the surface and towards the east near the bottom with the exception of the streamline curvature effect which is the weakest effect at this cross section fig 7d the driving terms co function near the western coast while east of the thalweg the lateral acceleration due to the coriolis force counteracts the other terms the baroclinic pressure gradient force fig 7a and the advected lateral momentum fig 7b are the dominant contributors to the secondary circulation and the associated lateral acceleration ranges from 1 99 m s 2 to 1 05 m s 2 and from 1 34 m s 2 to 0 9 m s 2 respectively the similarity of the patterns in fig 7a b suggests that lateral flows relax to the lateral gradients induced by the salinity intrusion over a stretch upstream of the analyzed section the coriolis induced acceleration fig 7c is comparatively small 0 21 m s 2 to 0 73 m s 2 and scales with the deviation in the streamwise flow from its vertical average eq 2 fig 5a upper left panel the lateral acceleration due to the streamline curvature is also small compared to the first two mechanisms 0 25 m s 2 to 0 32 m s 2 fig 7d the outflow conditions result in differences in the driving terms both compared to the inflow case and among each other fig 8 the pressure gradient and coriolis force drive counterclockwise and clockwise rotating cells respectively centered 1 km west of the thalweg fig 8a c the maximum lateral pressure gradient acceleration reaches 1 83 m s 2 at the surface and 3 74 m s 2 at the bottom fig 8a the coriolis induced acceleration is weaker ranging from 1 07 m s 2 to 0 78 m s 2 fig 8c only over the very western shoal do both drivers promote a clockwise rotation additionally the advection of lateral momentum fig 8b and the curvature induced lateral acceleration drive double and quadruple rotating cells respectively note that the contribution of the streamline curvature shows a qualitatively similar pattern in the inflow fig 7d and outflow cases fig 8d because the bends of the streamline when adjusting to the topography fundamentally remain the same during the two phases the outflow values however are much higher than the inflow values this is because the curvature effect is scaled with the squared flow velocity see eq 2 thus an outflow velocity of approximately 2 3 times the speed of the inflow velocity results in a curvature acceleration that is an order of magnitude larger than the acceleration during outflow over the western shallows all driving terms enhance the clockwise rotation of the flow at km 1 5 of the section the pressure gradient acceleration switches to promote a counterclockwise flow in the remainder of the channel at km 2 5 the accelerations due to lateral advection and streamline curvature reverse the former as in the case of the pressure gradient promotes a counterclockwise circulation over the eastern part of the channel the latter features two more sign alterations at km 3 and 3 6 between km 3 and 3 6 it aligns with the coriolis force in favor of clockwise circulation while between km 2 5 and 3 and east of km 3 6 the acceleration due to the streamline curvature coacts with the effects of the pressure gradient and advected momentum the superposition of the four driving terms in fig 8 results in a rather complicated picture because the terms are comparable in magnitude but are partly aligned and partly counteracting with each other for the individual momentum budget terms for t s2 t s3 and t s4 the readers are referred to the supplementary material 5 2 different appearances of secondary circulation in the sound based on the relative contributions and spatial structure of individual forces with respect to the lateral momentum budget we discuss in this section the appearance of helical secondary circulation cells at four transects through the sound fig 9 the lateral velocity is plotted as positive when directed towards the eastern shore and negative when directed towards the western shore 5 2 1 inflow phase during the inflow phase the secondary flow at t s1 top left panel in fig 9a shows a three layer structure west of the thalweg in the upper 20 m of the water column the flow follows the baroclinic pressure gradient force and advection of lateral momentum compare with fig 7a b thus a clockwise rotation develops west of the thalweg in the upper 20 m the near bottom flow reverses towards the center in agreement with coriolis induced acceleration fig 7c east of the thalweg the flow rotates in the opposite counter clockwise direction to the upper circulation on the western side of the thalweg such that lateral flows converge near the surface and diverge at mid depths over the thalweg fig 9a top left panel these counterrotating helical cells are well illustrated by the quadrupole like pattern of lateral velocity according to the above analysis of the momentum budget the pressure gradient force and advection of lateral momentum appear to drive the convergence divergence pattern over the thalweg at t s2 fig 9a top right panel the lateral flow structure is similar to that at t s1 despite the different locations of the transects the differences between the two sections suggest that the relative importance of the four individual processes is slightly changed between t s1 and t s2 one such important difference is that the surface clockwise rotating cell has a greater extension to the west in t s2 than in t s1 because of the shape of the channel as well as the pronounced eastward bottom current over the entire western part of t s2 at the shallowest transect t s3 drogden sill an anticlockwise circulation encompasses the whole transect fig 9a middle panel the bottom water flows to the east and the near surface water flows in the opposite direction this circulation pattern is mainly generated by the combination of the coriolis force and the advection of lateral momentum over the sill the contribution of the pressure gradient driven flow is the weakest at t s4 a circulation with two vertically stacked cells is observed fig 9a bottom panel the bottom cell is limited to the deep part of the transect the flow is eastward at the surface and bottom and westward in between this three layer structure along with the slope of the zero velocity interface supports the observations of umlauf and arneborg 2009 taken in the same region along this section the two main terms explaining this circulation type are the pressure gradient and coriolis force which compete against each other 5 2 2 outflow phase t s1 is dominated by one large secondary circulation cell that covers almost the entire cross sectional plane fig 9b top left panel apparently the coriolis force and the lateral momentum advected over the western shoal explain this two layer structure which has an eastward flow of up to 0 2 m s 1 near the surface and a westward recirculation at mid depths fig 9b upper left panel only close to the eastern coast does the circulation weakly follow the aforementioned patterns of the lateral pressure gradient and advection of lateral momentum however east of km 2 5 to the thalweg the combined effects of pressure gradients and advected lateral momentum tend to slow down the clockwise circulation cell the flow field over the channel axis is dominated by flows generated over the western shoal the secondary circulation at t s2 during the outflow phase features a hexapole structure over the deep channel of the transect fig 9b top right panel this feature results from the combined effects of a classical pressure gradient induced quadrupole structure and a quadrupole structure generated by streamline curvature over the eastern slope slightly altered by the influence of the advected lateral momentum to the west and feeding into the western cells of the hexapole the flow is directed eastward at mid depths and westward at the bottom and is overlain with a shallow cell featuring surface flow to the west the dominant mechanisms underlying this circulation are similar to those of t s1 i e the pressure gradient drives a two layer flow and is further modified by the coriolis force near the bottom which results in a three layer structure because the longitudinal flow changes sign between the inflow outflow phase these two mechanisms act in the opposite direction during the outflow phase compared the inflow phase one of the most notable features of t s2 is the appearance of counterrotation helixes in the deep part of the channel these helixes are among the most important differences between the dynamics at t s2 and known theoretical cases of secondary circulation at t s3 the outflow circulation cell is similar to the inflow circulation cell compare the panels in the middle of figs 9a and 9b due to the barotropic nature of outflow and associated frictional dominance lateral flows at this section appear to be weaker than those in the other deeper sections therefore we could not identify a clear forcing mechanism at this section during the outflow phase however the lateral currents are stronger and the driving mechanism can be better exposed in the inflow case than in the outflow case here the coriolis force combined with the advected lateral momentum dominates the momentum budget westward near the surface and eastward near the bottom in contrast in the outflow case the coriolis force and streamline curvature cause the strongest contributions to the secondary circulation and the influence of the pressure gradient is much smaller than that of all other terms obviously the lateral circulation over a very shallow bottom differs greatly from the classical concepts of alternating helical flows during flood and ebb periods the lateral dynamics at t s4 during outflow almost mirror those during inflow compare the bottom panels in figs 9a and 9b in this situation the coriolis force and the pressure gradient manifest as the main mechanisms controlling the secondary flow 5 3 dynamics in the great belt transect t v which cuts through measurement station o v is selected to illustrate the hydrodynamics of the great belt see fig 1 the transect has a width of 19 km and a deep channel with a maximum depth of 35 m on its eastern side while most of the transect is 5 m to 20 m deep fig 10 the main along stream inflow with a maximum velocity of 0 6 m s 1 at km 16 8 0 44 m s 1 at 21 m depth occurs in the deepest channel of the transect and there is a secondary maximum of 0 4 m s 1 over the western edge of the channel at km 14 7 0 37 m s 1 at 5 5 m depth fig 10a as in the wider transects through the sound t s2 a weak countercurrent minimum velocity of 0 11 m s 1 at the surface is observed over the shallowest part of the transect a ridge located approximately at km 4 during the outflow phase the largest axial velocity of 0 9 m s 1 is found at the surface at km 13 6 fig 10d weak countercurrents are present in the deep channel and in the other troughs of the transect the gradient richardson numbers for the inflow and outflow cases are presented in fig 10b and e respectively as in the sound the inflow phase presents a stable water column between the mixed surface and bottom layers while the outflow phase features an increased surface layer depth and reduced ri over most of the water column especially over the eastern ridge bordering the deep channel on the western side however in the western part of the transect which is an area of generally slow axial flow the deep and bottom layers feature increased ri the stability is still reduced in the near surface area under inflow conditions the deep channel features a lateral eastward flow near the surface and westward flow at depth while the shallower areas to the west are characterized by eastward lateral flow at the bottom and westward flow at the surface fig 10c during the outflow phase the entire width of the transect features eastward flow at the surface and westward flow at depth fig 10f small and weak counterrotating cells are observed only in the deep parts of the transect the secondary circulation of this transect mainly reflects the influence of the coriolis force and in the inflow case the advected lateral momentum see supplementary material this agrees with the findings of li et al 2014 that the influence of the coriolis force increases with channel width 6 secondary circulation and the need to use ultrafine resolution grid resolution is known as a crucial aspect for numerical modeling we performed an extra case study using a coarser grid experiment coarse in which the finest grid resolution is 500 m in the ocean straits the coarse results are compared with the results of the ultrafine resolution case discussed above fine uses a resolution as fine as 100 m in the narrow channels of the nbtz the aim of the comparison is to reveal the importance of realistically resolving secondary circulation and the impact of resolution on the two way exchange 6 1 across channel features depending on the width of the channel the horizontal grid resolution of a model may be insufficient to 1 resolve the topography in detail and 2 reproduce the realistic lateral circulation and associated along channel dispersion and tracer advection stanev et al 2018 the grid spacing of 500 m in coarse fig 11a is not sufficient to resolve cells of 1 km width see fig 9 in contrast the 100 m spacing in fine fig 11b allows these cells to be resolved a comparison with the observational data see also section 3 1 shows that the correlation coefficients between simulations in coarse and observations at o v at 5 m depth are lower than those between simulations in fine and the same observations 0 83 versus 0 85 for the axial velocities and 0 58 versus 0 61 for the lateral velocities to more clearly visualize the issues associated with the choice of lateral resolution the t s2 section is stretched in fig 11 to show the deep part of the channel where multiple helical cells appear in fine see top right panels in fig 9 this deep part of the channel is resolved by only 2 3 vertical columns in coarse and approximately eight vertical columns in fine the deep part of the channel is selected for the following analysis because narrower channels are more prone than wider channels to feature counterrotating cells while wider channels tend to feature one large circulation cell see also li et al 2014 this decision is justified by the comparison between fig 11f and fig 11d in coarse the hexapole simulated in fine is not generated the differences between the two experiments are particularly large during the outflow phase the helical circulation cells support vertical and lateral mixing and as a result fig 11g j ri in coarse is much larger than that in fine the latter shows pronounced small scale structures which do not appear in coarse 6 2 along channel features in estuaries the lateral circulation affects the along channel density gradient and is of major importance for the along channel velocities lerczak and geyer 2004 scully et al 2009 becherer et al 2015 especially in meandering channels momentum is exchanged between the axial and lateral directions pein et al 2018 in the nbtz the three straits are characterized by highly variable geometric complexity therefore the secondary circulation in each strait is very diverse it is expected that resolving the helixes mesoscale elements of straits circulation would also be important for the adequate simulation of transport rates axial flows the differences between the axial flows of fine and coarse are analyzed in stanev et al 2018 therefore we will only add that the transport through the sound in coarse is 12 smaller than that in fine and the ratio between the water transports in the great belt and the sound changes from 2 7 in coarse to 3 in fine for the partition of flows between the two straits see stanev et al 2018 obviously changing the resolution in the narrow channels changes their resistance and consequently the partition of flows between the two straits fig 12 shows the transports at t s2 for a period of 50 d a period that includes a number of inflow and outflow events transports in fine are slightly larger than those in coarse fig 12a this underestimation is due to unresolved small scale processes especially secondary circulation as the secondary circulation enables the effective exchange of momentum between the axial and lateral flows pein et al 2018 enhancing the two directional exchange flow fig 12c in the long term average the net water transport through the sound in coarse is only 78 5 of that in fine 9 9 10 3 m3 s 1 at low net transports the range of the in and outflow values is larger in fine fig 12b than in coarse fig 12d thus fine shows stronger transports than coarse in both directions at these times i e fine features a stronger countercurrent structure than coarse the well resolved secondary circulation in fine yields increased vertical shears with respect to coarse fig 11d and f on the other hand the secondary circulation acts as an important driving force for the redistribution of the along channel momentum budget through differential advection and thus strongly affects the streamwise dynamics less stable stratification in the water column occurs when a finer grid resolution is used fig 11g j to illustrate the differences in the simulated salinity axial baroclinic velocity and richardson number between fine and coarse the results of coarse fig 13 are compared with those of fine fig 3 the reduced mixing in coarse leads to a stronger salinity stratification of the water column compare fig 13a b with fig 3a b and larger ri compare fig 13g h with fig 3g h especially north of the drogden sill south of the drogden sill the gravity current is larger in fine than in coarse compare fig 13e f with fig 3e f the maximum salinity and axial velocity of the gravity current at station s4 averaged for the inflow period are 24 6 psu and 0 29 m s 1 in fine versus 22 1 psu and 0 27 m s 1 in coarse figs 3e and 13e respectively the differences between the two simulations are even more pronounced during the outflow period the almost vertical salinity front in fine is replaced by two layer vertical stratification in coarse which resembles the stratification in partially mixed tidal estuaries compare fig 13b with fig 3b regarding the temporal variability of salinity profiles the model results in locations s2 and s4 are compared between fine and coarse fig 13i j with fig 3i j at location s2 the water column of fine experiences stronger mixing than that of coarse both surface and bottom salinity values feature increased temporal variation and adopt a wider range of salinity values in fine than in coarse the vertical salinity gradient in fine is much reduced compared to the well stratified salinity profiles of coarse at location s4 which is south of the drogden sill coarse features lower salinity than fine in the surface layer during most of the analyzed period more importantly as a result of the use of a fine resolution the gravity flow is more pronounced in fine than in coarse the stronger mixing allows for a higher salinity in the drogden sill during the inflow phase compare figs 3a and 13a such processes are very influential for the mbi because they maintain the water mass structure in the baltic sea 7 conclusions the semi implicit hydroscience model schism with horizontal resolutions of about 100 m in main channels is able adequately simulate not only along channel flow but also the lateral circulation in the channels of the nbtz the nbtz experiences alternating inflow and outflow events unlike the flood and ebb processes in tidal estuaries the inflow outflow events are driven by irregular atmospheric forces the longer time scales of water mass exchange are thus set by the atmosphere unlike the tidal straining in estuaries in the nbtz the isohaline is more strained during the inflow period than during the outflow period in the outflow case the more turbulent outflow tends to weaken stratification the spatial distribution of secondary circulation is rather complex due to the relative importance of individual physical processes with respect to the momentum budget and depends on the phase of inflow outflow the streamline geometry and the along axis location in the sound the canonical double helix patterns that occur due to the lateral density gradient are important only during inflow phases in the vicinity of the kattegat in the northern part of the sound 0 km 80 km lateral baroclinic forcing and advection are the main mechanisms driving the lateral circulation coriolis forcing becomes important at wide cross section locations the streamline curvature effect in all sections is relatively small during inflow but becomes significant during outflow due to the asymmetry between the axial flow intensity of the inflow and outflow moreover this effect can be dominant in the lateral momentum budget at curved sections of the along axis direction e g t s3 in the southern reaches of the sound 100 km 130 km the lateral water circulation is a result of a more complex combination of factors among which the streamline curvature effect or coriolis forcing make the main contribution to the circulation helical cells develop in deep parts of the channels both the observations and model results demonstrate that these cells are not observed over the shallow strongly friction dominated drogden sill in many cases the horizontal extension of cells is 1 km and in some deep passages counterrotating cells occur below surface cells with a resolution of about 100 m new transport and mixing pathways that were previously unresolved appear fundamental to the strait dynamics in particular a horizontal resolution of 100 m is essential to fully resolve the secondary circulation approximately ten grid elements per individual helix when the resolution coarsens approximately by a factor 5 in coarse the simulation severely underestimates the lateral circulation leading to an underestimation of the vertical and lateral turbulent mixing this results in a more stratified water mass the associated changes in temperature salinity and density feed back into the circulation these changes slow down the axial flow lead to a 12 reduction of the transport through the sound and limit the importance of the passage relative to the great belt the overall impact is notable at least at a regional scale the problems caused by the failure to resolve the secondary circulation in straits and estuaries thus appear similar to the problems caused by the failure to resolve mesoscale eddies in ocean models the numerical modeling of the baltic sea circulation based on structured grids has long history lehmann 1995 schrum 1997 schrum and backhaus 1999 janssen 2002 meier et al 1999 2003 2006 2017 she et al 2006 2007 however only recently numerical simulations with horizontal resolution better than 1000 m became available gräwe et al 2015 mohrholz et al 2015 it seems timely to address the issue of the realism of simulations which do not resolve secondary circulation in the straits the first group of cited works or only permit it the second group this can be considered as a step towards further improving the model parameterizations in the straits in the structured grid climatic models these climatic models provided present computational resources cannot ensure fine enough horizontal resolution and long term integration at the same time therefore inter comparison studies like the one of placke et al 2018 should look in more detail in the two layer strait exchange finally it is worth noting that there are some important differences between the two layer exchange flow in the nbtz and that in other straits such as the gibraltar and bosporus straits in the gibraltar strait neither the surface nor the deep currents are known to be blocked by specific atmospheric or tidal events i e no reversal of transport occurs in the bosporus strait the situation is comparable to a salt wedge estuary with a strong salinity contrast between the surface and bottom water the salinity front moves back and forth in response to meteorological conditions an interesting result here is that depending on the horizontal resolution the appearance of the interface separating the north sea and baltic sea waters can differ strongly therefore future works should perform an intercomparison study on the lateral circulation in different straits and the

23974,in this paper we explore the secondary flows in the danish straits using observations and numerical simulations performed with the unstructured grid hydrodynamic model schism covering the north sea and baltic sea the straits are resolved on scales of up to 100 m given that large scale atmospheric variability dominates the transport in these straits we focus on the processes with subtidal time scales similarities and differences between the in and outflows in the straits and flood and ebb flows in estuaries are analyzed contrary to the tidal straining in estuaries the danish straits feature substantial differences in the stratification stability during the outflow and inflow phases with a resolution of 100 m new transport and mixing pathways that were previously unresolved appear fundamental to the strait dynamics the variety of the strait morphology leads to high variability in the appearance of secondary circulation helical cells often with a horizontal extension of 1 km develop in the deep parts of the channels a comparison between the high resolution simulation and a simulation with a coarse grid of 500 m in the straits suggests that the coarser resolution overestimates the stratification and misrepresents the transport balance the axial velocities and transport through the sound are underestimated by 12 these differences are explained by the missing secondary circulation when the coarse resolution is used approximately two grid points per cell instead of ten grid points per cell in the fine resolution model along with the resulting changes in mixing along the straits in conclusion the use of ultrafine resolution grids is essential to adequately resolve secondary flow patterns and two layer exchange thus the problems caused by the failure to resolve the secondary circulation in straits appear similar to the problems caused by the failure to resolve mesoscale eddies in ocean models 1 introduction straits connecting estuarine basins with an open ocean or a more saline sea are typically characterized by a two layer exchange flow with an upper layer freshwater transport of low salinity water toward the more saline basin and a compensatory transport of saline bottom water this situation is similar to the known estuarine circulation hansen and rattray 1966 however while the alternating circulation in estuaries is largely dependent on tides the alternating inflow outflow regimes in straits are predominantly driven by changes in atmospheric forcing examples of such straits are the bosporus strait stanev et al 2017 and the north sea baltic sea transition zone nbtz fig 1 in the nbtz surface water from the baltic sea in the long term mean propagates in the northward direction overlying saline bottom water originating from the north sea jakobsen 1995 stanev et al 2015 however the direction of the along strait velocity component alters between net inflow from the saltier side towards the fresher side hereafter taken as the positive direction or net outflow negative direction depending on the wind and atmospheric pressure in tidally dominated estuaries vertical stratification typically increases during the ebb tide outflow due to a mechanism that is known as tidal straining in the estuarine literature simpson et al 1990 during flood tide inflow the process of straining acts reversely and reduces stratification given the overall similarities between estuaries and straits connecting ocean basins the expectation is that the atmospherically driven exchange flows in straits are subject to a similar straining mechanism as the exchange flows in estuaries at sub tidal time scales outflows are expected to stratify the water column with vertical shearing of the horizontal velocities while inflows are expected to destratify the water column tending towards well mixed conditions one goal of this study is to clarify the assumption of analogous along channel and secondary dynamics between estuaries and straits it is important to recognize that straits allow two way transport at both ends of the channel along channel flow is associated with flow in the perpendicular direction known as secondary circulation lerczak and geyer 2004 in bending channels given vertical density differences secondary circulation typically develops as a helical trajectory of the three dimensional flow pattern rozovskii 1957 chant 2002 2010 in estuaries the channel curvature coriolis deflection and differential advection of buoyancy drive across channel currents chant 2002 2010 secondary flows can be indirectly perceptible to the human eye such as in the case of laterally converging flows that accumulate foam along the channel axis as reported by nunes and simpson 1985 lerczak and geyer 2004 demonstrated the importance of interactions between along channel and cross channel dynamics due to the latter s influence on along channel density gradients becherer et al 2015 suggested that lateral circulation contributes substantially to estuarine exchange flows however due to missing spatial and temporal coverage in observations and a lack of focus on the lateral direction knowledge of secondary flows in the straits in particular in the danish straits is insufficient although the associated theoretical ideas are not new garrett et al 1993 garrett 2004 considering that the lateral circulation in estuaries is strongly affected by local morphology pein et al 2018 in the present study we present a numerical model study of hydrodynamics in the nbtz aiming to gain more insight into lateral processes and their appearance in realistic ocean straits as well as the feedbacks between along channel and secondary dynamics in the nbtz the flow direction alternates irregularly manifesting a principal resemblance to the tidal circulation in estuaries usually during periods dominated by strong currents the flow in the straits is unidirectional similar to two layer flow driven by gravitational convection in tidal estuaries zheng and weisberg 2004 currents in straits are also two directional given that the vertically integrated transport decreases below a critical value stanev et al 2017 2018 thus the different secondary circulation regimes in the nbtz straits are expected to be similar to those in tidal estuaries and this expectation will be scrutinized in the present study to the best of our knowledge the lateral circulation in the narrow straits connecting the baltic sea and north sea has not been reported based on observations umlauf and arneborg 2009 observed a persistent transverse circulation associated with a gravity current passing through a channel after the flow exited the straits the lateral circulation in the sound one of the straits connecting the north sea and baltic sea was documented by stanev et al 2015 using results from numerical simulations they illustrated the importance of the lateral transport of momentum to the vertical mixing of waters from different ocean basins however the horizontal resolution of the straits in their work 1 km was not sufficient to adequately resolve the lateral circulation in many estuaries the lateral flow is an order of magnitude smaller than the flow in the axial direction lerczak and geyer 2004 furthermore the helical flow which manifests as a single or double cell secondary circulation pattern rhoads and kenworthy 1998 is associated with strong vertical motion and mixing pein et al 2018 the helical flow pattern is crucial for the conservation of flow momentum as well as for tracer transport because momentum is neatly exchanged between the axial and perpendicular directions becherer et al 2015 pein et al 2018 simulations can be biased if this helical cell structure is not resolved in numerical models the consequences are expected to be similar to those in numerical simulations of ocean circulation that do not resolve baroclinic eddies we consider the model skill in representing the secondary dynamics a crucial test for the quality of models with respect to the representation of 4d strait dynamics therefore in the present study we demonstrate the appearance of secondary circulation using both observations from field data and numerical modeling a large portion of the data are derived from simulations using the semi implicit cross scale hydroscience integrated system model schism zhang et al 2016a b which is an unstructured grid model stanev et al 2018 provided an extensive review on modeling in the nbtz along with an analysis of the skill of schism in resolving the interbasin exchange in the present study we continue the analysis of stanev et al 2018 but focus on secondary circulation the structure of the paper is as follows section 2 addresses the numerical model and the basics of physical oceanography in the studied region based on the model simulations section 3 addresses the intercomparison between observations and model results section 4 presents an analysis of the secondary circulation and its main characteristics in the sound and great belt section 5 discusses the performance of the model using an ultrafine resolution in the narrow straits and the impact of this resolution on the properties of strait exchange this section is followed by the conclusions in section 6 2 the numerical model and methods 2 1 the model area and rationale an extensive review of the hydrodynamics in the nbtz and the numerical modeling of these hydrodynamics with schism can be found in zhang et al 2016a and stanev et al 2018 therefore we only briefly summarize the most relevant knowledge for the present study and refer the reader to the above cited works for further details and references one important focus of previous works was the oceanographic conditions in the interconnected basins that is the north sea and the baltic sea and the role of strait exchange in their dynamics the model area addressed here see fig 1 is the same as the model area in the above studies three straits i e the little belt the great belt and the sound connect the north sea and baltic sea the little belt with a width of 1 km is the narrowest passage the great belt is the widest strait width of 15 km and the width of the sound is 4 km these narrow passages efficiently filter the tides the major part of mechanical energy to the south of the straits in the baltic sea is provided by the wind and atmospheric pressure since these straits are shallow the dominant dynamic balance is between the pressure gradient and friction the transports in the great belt and sound correlate well with each other in a nonlinear manner stanev et al 2015 furthermore the transport rate between the great belt and the sound of 2 7 is not linearly proportional to the ratio of the cross sectional areas of the narrowest sections of the great belt and sound stanev et al 2018 overall the water transport in the sound is small compared to its cross sectional area revealing the strong frictional control in this strait the vertical mixing in the sound particularly in the area of the drogden sill section t s3 in fig 1b strongly affects the stratification and propagation of gravity currents into the baltic sea since secondary circulation is a major factor determining mixing in the straits chant 2010 the present study also addresses the capability of relatively coarse grid models to resolve this circulation adequately this is important when developing adequate physical parameterizations in the nbtz for models with suboptimal resolution in the straits 2 2 brief description of the numerical model setup and experiments in this study we use the same setup as that used by stanev et al 2018 which was a further development of the model presented by zhang et al 2016a these previous works focused on model validation the impact of resolution the role of atmospheric forcing in interbasin exchange and major inflows and the axial two layer water transport in the individual straits by using unstructured grids we avoid two fundamental problems of structured grid approaches in addressing cross scale processes from the strait to basin scale 1 one way nesting techniques as these techniques are not appropriate when simulating the dynamics of interconnected basins and 2 insufficient horizontal resolution which becomes a challenge when simulating narrow straits and connected basins in one model the hydrodynamic model schism uses a hybrid finite element and finite volume approach to solve the primitive equations and implicit techniques for terms that set stringent stability constraints e g cfl the eulerian lagrangian method is applied for momentum advection the model is hydrostatic and uses the boussinesq approximation the model domain covers the north and baltic seas with a resolution of up to 100 m in the narrow straits connecting the two basins the minimum grid side length is 80 m in the little belt this model accurately resolves the interbasin exchange this ultrafine resolution is the most important difference between the present model and other models that resolved the straits with a resolution of 600 m gräwe et al 2015 mohrholz et al 2015 in the open sea parts of the baltic sea and north sea an essentially uniform resolution of 3 km is specified the vertical grid uses a variable number of sigma layers and a shaved cell technique to eliminate staircases zhang et al 2015 see stanev et al 2018 give more details about the model grid the shaved cells also shut down diapycnal mixing and reduce the pressure gradient errors the parameterizations described in the above cited earlier publications contribute to an adequate resolution of the baroclinic instability and the frictionally dominated dynamics in the straits data from the 7 km resolution cosmo eu model of the german weather service dwd are used as atmospheric forcing these data include the hourly wind atmospheric pressure air temperature dew point temperature and cloud cover values the freshwater fluxes from 34 rivers are prescribed from the pan european hydrological predictions for the environment ehype product of the swedish meteorological and hydrological institute smhi at the open boundaries data from the copernicus product http marine copernicus eu are used these data include hourly values of elevation horizontal velocity salinity and temperature the analyzed period of integration is from march 1 2014 to november 24 2016 to study the dependence of the representation of two layer exchange in the straits on the horizontal resolution stanev et al 2018 performed an additional experiment in which the resolution in the nbtz was coarsened to the finest value of 500 m this experiment is referred to as coarse while the above described experiment with a higher resolution is referred to as fine we use results from the coarse experiment to analyze the dependence of the secondary circulation in the straits on the resolution in this context it is important to note that although the areas of the narrowest cross sections are almost the same in the two models with 100 m and 500 m resolutions the same topography is used in both models the transport rates change substantially the explanation for this result given in stanev et al 2018 is that the use of a fine resolution allows us to resolve the velocity shear along the straits coasts in section 5 we will demonstrate the impact of the different resolutions on the straits secondary circulation 2 3 the lateral momentum balance equation to understand secondary flow patterns and to assess the importance of different processes to the total momentum budget we analyze the lateral momentum equation on cross sections through the straits to provide the necessary physical background we present the fundamental equation and relevance of its different terms following nidzieko et al 2009 the lateral momentum equation in a curvilinear polar coordinate system is as follows 1 u n t u s 2 u s 2 r s u s u n s u s u n s g ρ 0 z 0 ρ z n d z z 0 ρ z n d z f u s u s τ n ρ z τ b n ρ h here u s is the streamwise velocity u n is the lateral stream normal velocity u z is the vertical velocity s denotes the along stream direction n is the stream normal direction z is the vertical direction with positive indicating upward and t is the time the parameter r s is the streamline curvature radius the coriolis parameter is f 10 4 s 1 g 9 8 m s 2 is the gravitational acceleration and h is the local water depth the water density is ρ ρ 0 ρ where ρ 0 1000 kg m 3 is a reference density and ρ indicates the time variable density perturbations furthermore the shear stress in the lateral direction is τ n and at the bottom is τ b n overbars x denote vertical means thus barotropic contributions to the lateral momentum balance are not considered in the following analysis lacy and monismith 2001 by taking a time average of eq 1 in the inflow phase and outflow phase separately we obtain 2 u n t u s 2 u s 2 r s centrifugal acceleration u s u n s u s u n s advection g ρ 0 z 0 ρ z n d z z 0 ρ z n d z baroclinic pressure gradient f u s u s coriolis u n u z z τ b n ρ h friction here the term on the left hand side indicates local acceleration on the right hand side the first term is the contribution due to inertial forces associated with the streamline curvature this term is negligible for an ideally straight channel r s becomes infinite but can strongly contribute to the lateral momentum balance for a bended channel kalkwijk and booij 1986 pein et al 2018 moreover smaller topographic obstacles in the channel and other changes in geometry cause curvature of the streamline and induce lateral momentum which becomes more important with increasing stratification geyer 1993 the second term on the right hand side of eq 2 describes the acceleration due to the streamwise advection of lateral momentum this term reflects upstream influences on the lateral momentum and how the local situation differs from them nidzieko et al 2009 found that this term can be important especially where abrupt changes in curvature occur the third term is the acceleration due to lateral density gradients because advective velocities in the center of the channel exceed those in near shore area the along stream density gradient is translated into lateral density gradients this leads to the formation of two counterrotating secondary circulation cells one on each side of the channel the fourth term is the coriolis deflection of streamwise flow this term depends directly on the flow velocity li et al 2014 found that the influence of the coriolis deflection of streamwise flow increases with the channel width leading to the formation of a single cell secondary circulation the last term is the response of the system to the driving terms via friction which assumes that the reynolds stress plays the dominant role in balancing the former driving terms 3 model performance the two layer interbasin exchange 3 1 model validation here the observational data set described by stanev et al 2018 is compared with model simulations with a focus on the lateral currents the data were collected by the danish meteorological institute dmi at two adcp stations in the danish straits these stations were o v 55 207542 n 11 086632e at vengeancegrund in the great belt and o d at drogden fyr 55 536380 n 12 711413e in the sound see fig 1 for their positions the lengths of available data series differ between the two stations the intercomparison in fig 2 is for september 2014 may 2015 which is the period of observations in the sound the data in fig 2 and in the following analyses are de tided by taking a 24 hour running average results using data which are not de tided are shown for comparison in the supplementary material the variability of the axial velocity of the observations and simulations compare reasonably well fig 2a c the velocity maxima in the sound are slightly overestimated in the model however the statistics of the model and observation data agree reasonably well table 1 for the axial velocities the root mean square rms error is relatively small 0 38 m s 1 compared to the large amplitudes of the currents typically order of 1 m s 1 the correlation between the simulated and observed velocities is good 0 90 at the three depths measured at the stations see also table 1 the simulations and observations show less agreement in the lateral velocities fig 2b d than in the axial velocities at drogden sill the maximum correlation coefficient is only 0 43 at the surface and decreases with increasing depth table 1 at station o v the correlation increases from 0 60 at the surface to 0 68 at a 5 m depth comparing the two stations figs 2b and 4d reveals that lateral flow in the shallow o d station is very weak so small discrepancies strongly affect the correlation with observations in contrast the magnitude of the lateral flow variability at station o v is much larger than that at station o d this stronger signal is resolved by the model which is a motivation to analyze the secondary flow in depth 3 2 basic characteristics of the circulation in the sound in this section we assess how the model replicates the axial flow the associated salinity distribution and the density stratification we focus primarily on the sound because it has narrower passages than the great belt and provides a greater challenge for the horizontal resolution we investigate the characteristics of the flow on transect t sa during two selected periods 1 a period of net transport into the baltic sea 25 30 october 2014 and 2 a period of net transport from the baltic sea to the north sea 12 17 november 2014 the two periods while not representative of extreme conditions were chosen because the de tided i e 24 hour mean net transport is unambiguously in one direction throughout each period and the periods fall within the time window of available observational current data furthermore transect t sa follows the thalweg of the strait blue line in fig 1b 3 2 1 inflow conditions the salinity distribution fig 3a b and baroclinic axial velocity fig 3e f show a clear two layer structure in the sound to better visualize the vertical structure of velocity the local vertical mean values fig 3c d are subtracted from the axial velocity in fig 3e f the subtracted mean velocity clearly features two maxima minima associated with the narrowest and shallowest passages of the sound to quantify the rates of the stabilizing effect of density stratification and the destabilizing effect of velocity shear the gradient richardson number 3 r i g ρ 0 ρ z u s z 2 u n z 2 is presented in fig 3g h the black isoline is r i 0 25 showing the critical value below which the flow becomes unstable during inflow most of the section and water column manifest stable conditions fig 3a g values of ri 0 25 appear only in the bottom boundary layer and in the near surface layer near helsingborg km 25 t s1 around the island of ven km 45 and over the drogden sill km 90 the ri values are relatively low because of the enhanced mixing in the narrow passages and over the sill following transect t sa from the kattegat the baroclinic flow is directed southward near the surface with a maximum velocity reaching 0 5 m s 1 at approximately km 35 while a compensating flow northward directed is observed near the bottom fig 3e further south the core of the southward flow is displaced from the surface layer into intermediate depths at km 30 and then upon approaching the drogden sill propagates upslope this upslope transport pattern is explained by the channel topography which constrains the flow at the drogden sill the core of the baroclinic southward flow occupies the upper two thirds of the water column immediately behind the sill the high salinity water from the north sea follows the bottom slope as a gravity current the highest southward velocities mean of 0 37 m s for this period are observed at 5 10 m above the bottom at km 190 the bottom slope decreases and the gravity current slows down 3 2 2 outflow conditions during the outflow phase saltier water in the kattegat is pushed northward by the brackish baltic sea water masses fig 3b building a sharp density gradient near km 25 north of km 25 salinities are greater than 25 psu everywhere while southward of km 25 the salinity does not exceed 20 psu while the inflow situation demonstrates a clear pycnocline vertical stratification the density contrast during outflow conditions is mostly horizontally oriented the salinity appears relatively well mixed over most of the considered transect especially in the top 15 m compare figs 3a and 3b one exception is the area north of the salinity front where the vertical stratification is well pronounced the velocity shear is quite different under inflow and outflow conditions compare figs 3e and 3f the highest baroclinic northward velocities during the outflow event local mean velocities as shown in fig 3d are subtracted are found at the surface just north of the salinity front fig 3f close to the narrowest section of the sound there is a clear correlation in the northernmost part of the transect between the salinity stratification and the two layer exchange low salinity and northward transport at the surface and vice versa in the bottom layer this correlation is reminiscent of the estuarine circulation it seems counterintuitive that the richardson number ri is lower during the outflow phase than during the inflow phase compare figs 3g and 3h since this contradicts the process of tidal straining in estuaries a common expectation is that surface inflow of less saline baltic sea water should increase the density stratification and consequently the buoyancy term in eq 3 obviously the effect of the reversal of the flow direction due to atmospheric variability on stratification destratification is different from the effect of tides on the straining of isopycnals in a tidal dominant estuarine environment south of the drogden sill values of ri 0 25 are typically found at depths shallower than 5 15 m and the surface waters above these depths are well mixed notice that in the outflow period values of ri 0 25 are also at the bottom one exception is in the area of narrow section furthermore upper and bottom layers with low ri numbers merge at the shallowest depth drogden sill at km 80 100 which is primarily caused by the reduced density there north of the sill the entrainment of salty north sea water from the bottom quickly re establishes stability in the water column ri in the bottom layer increases again the contradiction between the analyzed data along the sound transect and observations from estuaries where the flood destabilizes the water column can be explained as follows this strait has a shallow sill and deepens in both directions from the sill towards the two connected ocean basins the shallow sill depth of only 8 m effectively limits the through flow during outflow events and thus also features weakened stratification north of the narrow section the two layer flows resemble estuarine circulation thus the mouth of the baltic sea is north of the narrow section the area between the narrow section and the sill determines most of the specificities of sound dynamics 3 2 3 temporal variability both periods described above are part of longer periods of net inflow or outflow to gain a full picture of temporal changes two stations s2 and s4 are selected to show the variability of vertical salinity profiles fig 3i j these locations are illustrated on top of fig 3a h the evolution of the salinity at stations s2 and s4 named after their proximity to transects t s2 and t s4 see fig 1 shows increasing and decreasing salinities at both sites during the inflow and outflow periods respectively at station s2 north of the drogden sill the water column is relatively well mixed the individual inflow and outflow events can be easily identified by the high and low salinity values at the shallower station s4 south of the drogden sill the surface salinity also remains low during the inflow phases the column gradually becomes more vertically homogeneous only during the outflow phases this indicates that the vertical stratification to the south of the sill is due to gravity flow of high salinity water near the bottom under outflow conditions vertical mixing dominates thus features similar to well stratified estuarine plumes can be found only in the kattegat north of the straits the along channel profiles of sea surface height ssh and sea surface and bottom salinity sss and bs respectively averaged for the whole run reveal a situation that is typical in estuaries fig 4a b c the ssh in the arkona basin is 8 cm higher than the ssh to the north of the narrow section most of the changes occur between the sill and the narrow section an abrupt change in the variability pattern of ssh fig 4d appears at the drogden sill and is identified by a discontinuity at km 100 as shown in fig 4g in the first 100 km of this section sss and bs decrease rapidly with distance from the kattegat fig 4b c to the south of the drogden sill the along channel gradients of ssh and sss are small figs 4d f are zoomed versions of fig 10 of stanev et al 2018 in the nbtz they feature a sequence of several major baltic inflows mbi e g in december 2014 or in late 2015 notably not all anomalies of sea level are associated with mbis e g the long term positive ssh anomaly in 2016 fig 4d but only those during which the trends of sea level on both sides of the straits oppose each other this is illustrated by the mbi in october november 2014 fig 4g when the ssh from the arkona basin to the drogden sill is lower than that in the kattegat this event is followed by inflow over the entire water column as identified by the high salinity anomalies for the same period fig 4h i although the slope of the salinity anomaly contours is unidirectional in the bottom layer fig 4i this slope changes in the surface layer fig 4h in result the gravity current propagates to the south the salinity signal at the sea surface propagates in both directions the sss and bs show the largest changes between the narrow section and the sill fig 4b c the area of the strongest horizontal salinity gradient migrates between the narrow section during outflow conditions and the sill during inflow conditions the bottom pattern fig 4i shows a clear southward propagation in the direction of the arkona basin this event is very clear during the inflow period at the end of 2014 mbi the respective sss signal as well as other strong sss changes appears at the same time as the bs signals however unlike the bottom signals they do not propagate much farther beyond the sill this asymmetry between the sss and bs is fundamental for the vertical overturning south of the sill 4 the two layer exchange in the sound below we analyze the averaged simulations under inflow and outflow conditions specified in section 3 at four cross sections fig 5 the cross sections are situated at the narrow passage near helsingborg south of ven island at the drogden sill and at the southern entrance into the sound km 24 51 90 and 127 respectively along transect t sa fig 1 3 in the figures the western shore is always on the left hand side 4 1 the axial flow during the inflow period the sound experiences net southward water transport at all cross sections fig 5a at the northernmost transect t s1 the channel is narrowest with a width of only 5 2 km fig 1 but reaches a maximum depth of 32 m here the axial velocity attains its maximum value of 0 8 m s 1 at the surface near the center of the channel fig 5a upper left panel transect t s2 is wider 14 8 km than transect t s1 and has a maximum depth of 40 m the flow is much slower at t s2 than at t s1 and features three local extrema all at depths of 4 12 m fig 5a upper right panel the weakest of the extrema 0 32 m s 1 is at 4 m depth in the shallow western part of the transect km 4 7 the other two extrema are over the western and eastern slopes of the narrow deep channel of the section km 10 and 11 3 at 12 and 11 m depth reaching values of 0 44 and 0 39 m s 1 respectively in the upper eastern corner of the transect the axial velocity features a counter current minimum 0 3 m s 1 transect t s3 at the drogden sill is the shallowest transect with a maximum depth of 8 m the transect width is 14 3 km the small cross section area results in a strong and unidirectional axial flow fig 5a middle panel the flow here is split into two branches one branch is at km 1 2 at the western coast and the other branch is at km 8 these branches have maximum velocities of 0 84 m s 1 and 0 94 m s 1 respectively note that the maximum velocities in this transect are observed in the subsurface layers unlike the case of the narrow section which has approximately the same section area transect t s4 with a maximum depth of 22 m and a width of 23 5 km features the largest cross sectional area the inflow of t s4is restricted to the deeper western part of the transect and has a maximum velocity of 0 73 m s 1 at 13 m depth km 4 fig 5a bottom panel in contrast the eastern side and most of the surface area of the transect feature flow in the opposite direction with a minimum velocity of 0 2 m s 1 at the surface at km 11 5 this pattern is in good qualitative and quantitative agreement with the observations of umlauf and arneborg 2009 on the gravity current passing through a channel see their fig 8a under outflow conditions the largest axial speeds are found at the surface fig 5b the axial velocity at t s1 reaches a maximum of 1 43 m s 1 in the middle of the transect km 2 5 fig 5b upper left panel similarly at t s2 the fastest flow occurs near the center km 9 5 but due to the larger cross sectional area of t s2 than of t s1 the velocity reaches only 0 75 m s 1 fig 5b upper right panel here a southward counterflow of denser water is present in the deep channel maximum 0 1 m s 1 the flow at t s3 is split into three branches featuring local extrema of 1 14 m s 1 1 18 m s 1 and 1 03 m s 1 at km 1 9 km 8 1 and km 12 8 respectively fig 5b middle left panel at t s4 the flow features two surface intensified extrema of 0 39 m s 1 and 0 48 m s 1 at km 8 7 and km 20 6 respectively fig 5b bottom panel 4 2 the stabilizing effect of density and destabilizing effect of velocity shear under inflow conditions all four transects across the sound are dynamically stable ri 0 25 except for the shallow mixed surface layers and the well developed turbulent bottom layer fig 6a only in the eastern part of t s4 is ri 0 25 at all depths fig 6a bottom panel note that in this area salinity is very low due to outflowing baltic sea water compared to the inflow period the outflow period demonstrates reduced ri in most of the water column at all transects fig 6b however in the near bottom region of the deep channels t s2 and t s4 ri is larger in the outflow period than in the inflow period here the fresher outflow slides over more saline water that remains in the deep layers also note the countercurrents at t s2 and t s4 fig 5b such that a strong vertical density gradient dominates over the relatively weak velocity shear from the above it follows that the outflow period is characterized by a turbulent jet reaching a depth of up to 14 m at t s4 fig 6b bottom panel this jet extends along the entire strait as a surface intensified flow reaching the channel bottom in the area of ts 1 sound proper and drogden sill fig 6b middle left panel north of the sill the influence of the saline north sea water becomes stronger and the mixed surface layer shoals towards the north 1 5 m at t s2 and less than 1 m at t s1 in fig 3b h the overall weakening of the dynamic stability during the outflow phase relative to the inflow phase is in contrast to the tidal straining simpson et al 1990 observed in tidally dominated estuaries but is more similar to estuaries that are fresh water dominated cheng et al 2013 nonetheless there are four fundamental differences between the straits of the nbtz and a typical estuary a the irregularity of forcing a tidal estuary is usually characterized by fixed and perpetually altering flood and ebb periods however in a strait the outflow phase is largely independent of the previous inflow phase and vice versa the phase durations and volume fluxes are subject to the irregularities of atmospheric influences b the magnitude of the net inflow is comparable with that of the two way exchange in the case presented here the outflow phase is characterized by much larger along channel velocities than the inflow phase by approximately a factor of 2 which leads to a much stronger velocity shear quadratic dependency and associated decrease in the gradient richardson number c the geometry of the strait is different with ocean basins at both ends a simplified strait can be described as two funnels connected at their narrow ends representing the location of the sill or narrow section while a typical estuary resembles a single funnel connecting a river narrow end to the ocean thus the processes occurring on the fresher side of a sill may not have counterparts in an estuary d the time scales are longer tides usually have a semidiurnal or diurnal periodicity leaving only few hours for the change from inflow to outflow in straits the intervals of constant or predominant net transport in one direction can be much longer than a few hours e g determined by the synoptic scales in the atmosphere this allows for much farther displacements of water parcels and a stronger adjustment in the stratification in our case b and c together allow for the effective dispersion of saline water in the gravity flow south of the sill rendering most of the water column between t s4 and t s3 weakly stratified fig 3b j similarly north of the sill the long time period of net transport in one direction allows for much of the saline water to be flushed out to the north of the narrow passage at helsingborg as well as a strong reduction in the vertical density gradients south of t s1 fig 3b i 5 the secondary circulation 5 1 analysis of the lateral momentum budget in this section we examine in detail the secondary circulation first addressing the temporal means of driving terms during given inflow and outflow periods for this purpose the individual terms introduced in eq 2 are analyzed using cross section t s1 as an example we assess the structures and relative importance of the driving terms the evolution term is not shown because for the relatively long period of integration it is small compared to the other terms fig 7 shows the transverse distribution of four individual accelerating terms at t s1 under inflow conditions the difference in the aspect ratio of t s1 here compared to the previous figures is explained by the need to well illustrate the vertical patterns of driving forces while in figs 5 6 and 9 a comparable scaling of all sections is preferable the lateral acceleration due to the pressure gradient fig 7a and the advection of lateral momentum fig 7b are indicative of a quadrupole pattern in the upper 20 m of the water column these patterns suggest the convergence of lateral flows at the surface and divergence of lateral flows at mid depths resulting in two helical cells a clockwise rotating cell west of the thalweg and a counterclockwise rotating cell east of the thalweg the coriolis force fig 7c is indicative of a single cell driving the lateral flow towards the west near the surface and towards the east near the bottom with the exception of the streamline curvature effect which is the weakest effect at this cross section fig 7d the driving terms co function near the western coast while east of the thalweg the lateral acceleration due to the coriolis force counteracts the other terms the baroclinic pressure gradient force fig 7a and the advected lateral momentum fig 7b are the dominant contributors to the secondary circulation and the associated lateral acceleration ranges from 1 99 m s 2 to 1 05 m s 2 and from 1 34 m s 2 to 0 9 m s 2 respectively the similarity of the patterns in fig 7a b suggests that lateral flows relax to the lateral gradients induced by the salinity intrusion over a stretch upstream of the analyzed section the coriolis induced acceleration fig 7c is comparatively small 0 21 m s 2 to 0 73 m s 2 and scales with the deviation in the streamwise flow from its vertical average eq 2 fig 5a upper left panel the lateral acceleration due to the streamline curvature is also small compared to the first two mechanisms 0 25 m s 2 to 0 32 m s 2 fig 7d the outflow conditions result in differences in the driving terms both compared to the inflow case and among each other fig 8 the pressure gradient and coriolis force drive counterclockwise and clockwise rotating cells respectively centered 1 km west of the thalweg fig 8a c the maximum lateral pressure gradient acceleration reaches 1 83 m s 2 at the surface and 3 74 m s 2 at the bottom fig 8a the coriolis induced acceleration is weaker ranging from 1 07 m s 2 to 0 78 m s 2 fig 8c only over the very western shoal do both drivers promote a clockwise rotation additionally the advection of lateral momentum fig 8b and the curvature induced lateral acceleration drive double and quadruple rotating cells respectively note that the contribution of the streamline curvature shows a qualitatively similar pattern in the inflow fig 7d and outflow cases fig 8d because the bends of the streamline when adjusting to the topography fundamentally remain the same during the two phases the outflow values however are much higher than the inflow values this is because the curvature effect is scaled with the squared flow velocity see eq 2 thus an outflow velocity of approximately 2 3 times the speed of the inflow velocity results in a curvature acceleration that is an order of magnitude larger than the acceleration during outflow over the western shallows all driving terms enhance the clockwise rotation of the flow at km 1 5 of the section the pressure gradient acceleration switches to promote a counterclockwise flow in the remainder of the channel at km 2 5 the accelerations due to lateral advection and streamline curvature reverse the former as in the case of the pressure gradient promotes a counterclockwise circulation over the eastern part of the channel the latter features two more sign alterations at km 3 and 3 6 between km 3 and 3 6 it aligns with the coriolis force in favor of clockwise circulation while between km 2 5 and 3 and east of km 3 6 the acceleration due to the streamline curvature coacts with the effects of the pressure gradient and advected momentum the superposition of the four driving terms in fig 8 results in a rather complicated picture because the terms are comparable in magnitude but are partly aligned and partly counteracting with each other for the individual momentum budget terms for t s2 t s3 and t s4 the readers are referred to the supplementary material 5 2 different appearances of secondary circulation in the sound based on the relative contributions and spatial structure of individual forces with respect to the lateral momentum budget we discuss in this section the appearance of helical secondary circulation cells at four transects through the sound fig 9 the lateral velocity is plotted as positive when directed towards the eastern shore and negative when directed towards the western shore 5 2 1 inflow phase during the inflow phase the secondary flow at t s1 top left panel in fig 9a shows a three layer structure west of the thalweg in the upper 20 m of the water column the flow follows the baroclinic pressure gradient force and advection of lateral momentum compare with fig 7a b thus a clockwise rotation develops west of the thalweg in the upper 20 m the near bottom flow reverses towards the center in agreement with coriolis induced acceleration fig 7c east of the thalweg the flow rotates in the opposite counter clockwise direction to the upper circulation on the western side of the thalweg such that lateral flows converge near the surface and diverge at mid depths over the thalweg fig 9a top left panel these counterrotating helical cells are well illustrated by the quadrupole like pattern of lateral velocity according to the above analysis of the momentum budget the pressure gradient force and advection of lateral momentum appear to drive the convergence divergence pattern over the thalweg at t s2 fig 9a top right panel the lateral flow structure is similar to that at t s1 despite the different locations of the transects the differences between the two sections suggest that the relative importance of the four individual processes is slightly changed between t s1 and t s2 one such important difference is that the surface clockwise rotating cell has a greater extension to the west in t s2 than in t s1 because of the shape of the channel as well as the pronounced eastward bottom current over the entire western part of t s2 at the shallowest transect t s3 drogden sill an anticlockwise circulation encompasses the whole transect fig 9a middle panel the bottom water flows to the east and the near surface water flows in the opposite direction this circulation pattern is mainly generated by the combination of the coriolis force and the advection of lateral momentum over the sill the contribution of the pressure gradient driven flow is the weakest at t s4 a circulation with two vertically stacked cells is observed fig 9a bottom panel the bottom cell is limited to the deep part of the transect the flow is eastward at the surface and bottom and westward in between this three layer structure along with the slope of the zero velocity interface supports the observations of umlauf and arneborg 2009 taken in the same region along this section the two main terms explaining this circulation type are the pressure gradient and coriolis force which compete against each other 5 2 2 outflow phase t s1 is dominated by one large secondary circulation cell that covers almost the entire cross sectional plane fig 9b top left panel apparently the coriolis force and the lateral momentum advected over the western shoal explain this two layer structure which has an eastward flow of up to 0 2 m s 1 near the surface and a westward recirculation at mid depths fig 9b upper left panel only close to the eastern coast does the circulation weakly follow the aforementioned patterns of the lateral pressure gradient and advection of lateral momentum however east of km 2 5 to the thalweg the combined effects of pressure gradients and advected lateral momentum tend to slow down the clockwise circulation cell the flow field over the channel axis is dominated by flows generated over the western shoal the secondary circulation at t s2 during the outflow phase features a hexapole structure over the deep channel of the transect fig 9b top right panel this feature results from the combined effects of a classical pressure gradient induced quadrupole structure and a quadrupole structure generated by streamline curvature over the eastern slope slightly altered by the influence of the advected lateral momentum to the west and feeding into the western cells of the hexapole the flow is directed eastward at mid depths and westward at the bottom and is overlain with a shallow cell featuring surface flow to the west the dominant mechanisms underlying this circulation are similar to those of t s1 i e the pressure gradient drives a two layer flow and is further modified by the coriolis force near the bottom which results in a three layer structure because the longitudinal flow changes sign between the inflow outflow phase these two mechanisms act in the opposite direction during the outflow phase compared the inflow phase one of the most notable features of t s2 is the appearance of counterrotation helixes in the deep part of the channel these helixes are among the most important differences between the dynamics at t s2 and known theoretical cases of secondary circulation at t s3 the outflow circulation cell is similar to the inflow circulation cell compare the panels in the middle of figs 9a and 9b due to the barotropic nature of outflow and associated frictional dominance lateral flows at this section appear to be weaker than those in the other deeper sections therefore we could not identify a clear forcing mechanism at this section during the outflow phase however the lateral currents are stronger and the driving mechanism can be better exposed in the inflow case than in the outflow case here the coriolis force combined with the advected lateral momentum dominates the momentum budget westward near the surface and eastward near the bottom in contrast in the outflow case the coriolis force and streamline curvature cause the strongest contributions to the secondary circulation and the influence of the pressure gradient is much smaller than that of all other terms obviously the lateral circulation over a very shallow bottom differs greatly from the classical concepts of alternating helical flows during flood and ebb periods the lateral dynamics at t s4 during outflow almost mirror those during inflow compare the bottom panels in figs 9a and 9b in this situation the coriolis force and the pressure gradient manifest as the main mechanisms controlling the secondary flow 5 3 dynamics in the great belt transect t v which cuts through measurement station o v is selected to illustrate the hydrodynamics of the great belt see fig 1 the transect has a width of 19 km and a deep channel with a maximum depth of 35 m on its eastern side while most of the transect is 5 m to 20 m deep fig 10 the main along stream inflow with a maximum velocity of 0 6 m s 1 at km 16 8 0 44 m s 1 at 21 m depth occurs in the deepest channel of the transect and there is a secondary maximum of 0 4 m s 1 over the western edge of the channel at km 14 7 0 37 m s 1 at 5 5 m depth fig 10a as in the wider transects through the sound t s2 a weak countercurrent minimum velocity of 0 11 m s 1 at the surface is observed over the shallowest part of the transect a ridge located approximately at km 4 during the outflow phase the largest axial velocity of 0 9 m s 1 is found at the surface at km 13 6 fig 10d weak countercurrents are present in the deep channel and in the other troughs of the transect the gradient richardson numbers for the inflow and outflow cases are presented in fig 10b and e respectively as in the sound the inflow phase presents a stable water column between the mixed surface and bottom layers while the outflow phase features an increased surface layer depth and reduced ri over most of the water column especially over the eastern ridge bordering the deep channel on the western side however in the western part of the transect which is an area of generally slow axial flow the deep and bottom layers feature increased ri the stability is still reduced in the near surface area under inflow conditions the deep channel features a lateral eastward flow near the surface and westward flow at depth while the shallower areas to the west are characterized by eastward lateral flow at the bottom and westward flow at the surface fig 10c during the outflow phase the entire width of the transect features eastward flow at the surface and westward flow at depth fig 10f small and weak counterrotating cells are observed only in the deep parts of the transect the secondary circulation of this transect mainly reflects the influence of the coriolis force and in the inflow case the advected lateral momentum see supplementary material this agrees with the findings of li et al 2014 that the influence of the coriolis force increases with channel width 6 secondary circulation and the need to use ultrafine resolution grid resolution is known as a crucial aspect for numerical modeling we performed an extra case study using a coarser grid experiment coarse in which the finest grid resolution is 500 m in the ocean straits the coarse results are compared with the results of the ultrafine resolution case discussed above fine uses a resolution as fine as 100 m in the narrow channels of the nbtz the aim of the comparison is to reveal the importance of realistically resolving secondary circulation and the impact of resolution on the two way exchange 6 1 across channel features depending on the width of the channel the horizontal grid resolution of a model may be insufficient to 1 resolve the topography in detail and 2 reproduce the realistic lateral circulation and associated along channel dispersion and tracer advection stanev et al 2018 the grid spacing of 500 m in coarse fig 11a is not sufficient to resolve cells of 1 km width see fig 9 in contrast the 100 m spacing in fine fig 11b allows these cells to be resolved a comparison with the observational data see also section 3 1 shows that the correlation coefficients between simulations in coarse and observations at o v at 5 m depth are lower than those between simulations in fine and the same observations 0 83 versus 0 85 for the axial velocities and 0 58 versus 0 61 for the lateral velocities to more clearly visualize the issues associated with the choice of lateral resolution the t s2 section is stretched in fig 11 to show the deep part of the channel where multiple helical cells appear in fine see top right panels in fig 9 this deep part of the channel is resolved by only 2 3 vertical columns in coarse and approximately eight vertical columns in fine the deep part of the channel is selected for the following analysis because narrower channels are more prone than wider channels to feature counterrotating cells while wider channels tend to feature one large circulation cell see also li et al 2014 this decision is justified by the comparison between fig 11f and fig 11d in coarse the hexapole simulated in fine is not generated the differences between the two experiments are particularly large during the outflow phase the helical circulation cells support vertical and lateral mixing and as a result fig 11g j ri in coarse is much larger than that in fine the latter shows pronounced small scale structures which do not appear in coarse 6 2 along channel features in estuaries the lateral circulation affects the along channel density gradient and is of major importance for the along channel velocities lerczak and geyer 2004 scully et al 2009 becherer et al 2015 especially in meandering channels momentum is exchanged between the axial and lateral directions pein et al 2018 in the nbtz the three straits are characterized by highly variable geometric complexity therefore the secondary circulation in each strait is very diverse it is expected that resolving the helixes mesoscale elements of straits circulation would also be important for the adequate simulation of transport rates axial flows the differences between the axial flows of fine and coarse are analyzed in stanev et al 2018 therefore we will only add that the transport through the sound in coarse is 12 smaller than that in fine and the ratio between the water transports in the great belt and the sound changes from 2 7 in coarse to 3 in fine for the partition of flows between the two straits see stanev et al 2018 obviously changing the resolution in the narrow channels changes their resistance and consequently the partition of flows between the two straits fig 12 shows the transports at t s2 for a period of 50 d a period that includes a number of inflow and outflow events transports in fine are slightly larger than those in coarse fig 12a this underestimation is due to unresolved small scale processes especially secondary circulation as the secondary circulation enables the effective exchange of momentum between the axial and lateral flows pein et al 2018 enhancing the two directional exchange flow fig 12c in the long term average the net water transport through the sound in coarse is only 78 5 of that in fine 9 9 10 3 m3 s 1 at low net transports the range of the in and outflow values is larger in fine fig 12b than in coarse fig 12d thus fine shows stronger transports than coarse in both directions at these times i e fine features a stronger countercurrent structure than coarse the well resolved secondary circulation in fine yields increased vertical shears with respect to coarse fig 11d and f on the other hand the secondary circulation acts as an important driving force for the redistribution of the along channel momentum budget through differential advection and thus strongly affects the streamwise dynamics less stable stratification in the water column occurs when a finer grid resolution is used fig 11g j to illustrate the differences in the simulated salinity axial baroclinic velocity and richardson number between fine and coarse the results of coarse fig 13 are compared with those of fine fig 3 the reduced mixing in coarse leads to a stronger salinity stratification of the water column compare fig 13a b with fig 3a b and larger ri compare fig 13g h with fig 3g h especially north of the drogden sill south of the drogden sill the gravity current is larger in fine than in coarse compare fig 13e f with fig 3e f the maximum salinity and axial velocity of the gravity current at station s4 averaged for the inflow period are 24 6 psu and 0 29 m s 1 in fine versus 22 1 psu and 0 27 m s 1 in coarse figs 3e and 13e respectively the differences between the two simulations are even more pronounced during the outflow period the almost vertical salinity front in fine is replaced by two layer vertical stratification in coarse which resembles the stratification in partially mixed tidal estuaries compare fig 13b with fig 3b regarding the temporal variability of salinity profiles the model results in locations s2 and s4 are compared between fine and coarse fig 13i j with fig 3i j at location s2 the water column of fine experiences stronger mixing than that of coarse both surface and bottom salinity values feature increased temporal variation and adopt a wider range of salinity values in fine than in coarse the vertical salinity gradient in fine is much reduced compared to the well stratified salinity profiles of coarse at location s4 which is south of the drogden sill coarse features lower salinity than fine in the surface layer during most of the analyzed period more importantly as a result of the use of a fine resolution the gravity flow is more pronounced in fine than in coarse the stronger mixing allows for a higher salinity in the drogden sill during the inflow phase compare figs 3a and 13a such processes are very influential for the mbi because they maintain the water mass structure in the baltic sea 7 conclusions the semi implicit hydroscience model schism with horizontal resolutions of about 100 m in main channels is able adequately simulate not only along channel flow but also the lateral circulation in the channels of the nbtz the nbtz experiences alternating inflow and outflow events unlike the flood and ebb processes in tidal estuaries the inflow outflow events are driven by irregular atmospheric forces the longer time scales of water mass exchange are thus set by the atmosphere unlike the tidal straining in estuaries in the nbtz the isohaline is more strained during the inflow period than during the outflow period in the outflow case the more turbulent outflow tends to weaken stratification the spatial distribution of secondary circulation is rather complex due to the relative importance of individual physical processes with respect to the momentum budget and depends on the phase of inflow outflow the streamline geometry and the along axis location in the sound the canonical double helix patterns that occur due to the lateral density gradient are important only during inflow phases in the vicinity of the kattegat in the northern part of the sound 0 km 80 km lateral baroclinic forcing and advection are the main mechanisms driving the lateral circulation coriolis forcing becomes important at wide cross section locations the streamline curvature effect in all sections is relatively small during inflow but becomes significant during outflow due to the asymmetry between the axial flow intensity of the inflow and outflow moreover this effect can be dominant in the lateral momentum budget at curved sections of the along axis direction e g t s3 in the southern reaches of the sound 100 km 130 km the lateral water circulation is a result of a more complex combination of factors among which the streamline curvature effect or coriolis forcing make the main contribution to the circulation helical cells develop in deep parts of the channels both the observations and model results demonstrate that these cells are not observed over the shallow strongly friction dominated drogden sill in many cases the horizontal extension of cells is 1 km and in some deep passages counterrotating cells occur below surface cells with a resolution of about 100 m new transport and mixing pathways that were previously unresolved appear fundamental to the strait dynamics in particular a horizontal resolution of 100 m is essential to fully resolve the secondary circulation approximately ten grid elements per individual helix when the resolution coarsens approximately by a factor 5 in coarse the simulation severely underestimates the lateral circulation leading to an underestimation of the vertical and lateral turbulent mixing this results in a more stratified water mass the associated changes in temperature salinity and density feed back into the circulation these changes slow down the axial flow lead to a 12 reduction of the transport through the sound and limit the importance of the passage relative to the great belt the overall impact is notable at least at a regional scale the problems caused by the failure to resolve the secondary circulation in straits and estuaries thus appear similar to the problems caused by the failure to resolve mesoscale eddies in ocean models the numerical modeling of the baltic sea circulation based on structured grids has long history lehmann 1995 schrum 1997 schrum and backhaus 1999 janssen 2002 meier et al 1999 2003 2006 2017 she et al 2006 2007 however only recently numerical simulations with horizontal resolution better than 1000 m became available gräwe et al 2015 mohrholz et al 2015 it seems timely to address the issue of the realism of simulations which do not resolve secondary circulation in the straits the first group of cited works or only permit it the second group this can be considered as a step towards further improving the model parameterizations in the straits in the structured grid climatic models these climatic models provided present computational resources cannot ensure fine enough horizontal resolution and long term integration at the same time therefore inter comparison studies like the one of placke et al 2018 should look in more detail in the two layer strait exchange finally it is worth noting that there are some important differences between the two layer exchange flow in the nbtz and that in other straits such as the gibraltar and bosporus straits in the gibraltar strait neither the surface nor the deep currents are known to be blocked by specific atmospheric or tidal events i e no reversal of transport occurs in the bosporus strait the situation is comparable to a salt wedge estuary with a strong salinity contrast between the surface and bottom water the salinity front moves back and forth in response to meteorological conditions an interesting result here is that depending on the horizontal resolution the appearance of the interface separating the north sea and baltic sea waters can differ strongly therefore future works should perform an intercomparison study on the lateral circulation in different straits and the
