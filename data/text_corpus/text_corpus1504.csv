7520,in this research an export coefficient based inexact fuzzy bi level multi objective programming ec ifblmop model was developed through integrating export coefficient model ecm interval parameter programming ipp and fuzzy parameter programming fpp within a bi level multi objective programming framework the proposed ec ifblmop model can effectively deal with the multiple uncertainties expressed as discrete intervals and fuzzy membership functions also the complexities in agricultural systems such as the cooperation and gaming relationship between the decision makers at different levels can be fully considered in the model the developed model was then applied to identify the optimal land use patterns and bmp implementing levels for agricultural nonpoint source nps pollution management in a subcatchment in the upper stream watershed of the miyun reservoir in north china the results of the model showed that the desired optimal land use patterns and implementing levels of best management of practices bmps would be obtained it is the gaming result between the upper and lower level decision makers when the allowable discharge amounts of nps pollutants were limited moreover results corresponding to different decision scenarios could provide a set of decision alternatives for the upper and lower level decision makers to identify the most appropriate management strategy the model has a good applicability and can be effectively utilized for agricultural nps pollution management keywords agricultural nonpoint source pollution bi level multi objective programming intervals fuzzy sets export coefficient model optimization management 1 introduction water is one of the most important material resources which is indispensable to human survival and development eliasson 2015 hu et al 2010 however with the expanding of human society and economic activity continuous water quality degradation has become one of the major factors restricting human sustainable development arenas s√°nchez et al 2016 zhou et al 2014 particularly with the gradual control of point source pollution the influence of nonpoint source nps pollution on water quality has become increasingly prominent carkovic et al 2015 chen et al 2016 many research reports in different countries and regions have proved that nps pollution especially the agricultural nps pollution is the primary cause leading to water environmental deterioration carkovic et al 2015 haregeweyn and yohannes 2003 pionke et al 2000 shen et al 2012 turnbull et al 2010 volk et al 2016 improvement of surface water environment depended on the effective management and control of agricultural nps pollution which has become the important and difficult point in water environmental research evan et al 2014 geng et al 2015 tan et al 2010 2013 wu et al 2016 thus it is very urgent and important to develop some advanced methods and seek the optimal management schemes for agricultural nps pollution control in the processes of agricultural nps pollution management different groups at different decision making levels may hold distinct opinions on water quality protection liu et al 2013 for example famers at the lower decision making level may hope to maintain or even increase the area of cropland and reduce the implementing levels of different best management practices bmps to increase the agricultural benefit and cut down the bmp implementing costs such decisions might lead to increasing amounts of pollutants released and transported to the downstream water bodies on the contrary government officials at the upper decision making level may conventionally focus on the balance between increasing agricultural system benefits and mitigating nps pollution through changing a certain area of agricultural land to forests in order to satisfy certain nutrient discharge permits thus it is a great challenge to make out sound strategies which can simultaneously satisfy the demands of bi level decision makers concurrently agricultural systems are very complicated uncertainties may exist in many system components processes factors and their interrelationships cai et al 2009a b 2011 cui et al 2015 li et al 2009 luo et al 2006 rong et al 2017 parameters in agricultural system are difficult to be given as deterministic values in the process of nps pollution management consequently much information might merely be obtained as intervals and fuzzy numbers dai et al 2016 huang et al 2012 for instance some parameters such as target areas of each land use type and implementing levels of bmps can only be obtained as discrete intervals with deterministic upper and lower bounds also some obtained information e g the discharge permits of nps pollutants can only be expressed as fuzzy sets with known possibility distributions in addition for some interval parameters its upper and lower bounds are still uncertain e g the land use benefit and bmp implementing cost coefficients resulting in dual uncertainties e g fuzzy bounded intervals therefore in order to effectively address such complexities and uncertainties it is very important to develop a bi level method under multiple uncertainties when conducting research on agricultural nps pollution management in recent years there have been extensive studies on water resources management with focus on nps pollution reduction particularly various integrated optimization models were proposed to deal with multiple uncertainties in agricultural nps pollution management systems ji et al 2014 liu et al 2015 for example an inexact agricultural water quality management model was developed to identify the optimal cropping area applied manure fertilizer amount and livestock husbandry size within an agricultural system zhang et al 2009 a radial interval chance constrained programming riccp method was proposed to explore the most profit agricultural development strategies while restricting environmental impacts to an acceptable level tan et al 2011 as the research continues on more comprehensive models and supporting systems were developed to support water environmental management dong et al 2014 zhang et al 2011 in addition to the development of optimization models some researchers tried to couple the simulation and optimization framework to better describe the uncertainties in the processes of pollution generation and management zeng et al 2016 for instance a robust simulation optimization modeling system and an inexact simulation based stochastic optimization method were successively developed for supporting agricultural nonpoint source nps effluent trading planning zhang et al 2014 zhang et al 2015 thus these previous research on agricultural nps pollution management was mainly focused on dealing with the multiple uncertainties in the systems however system complexities such as the inherent structure of a real world case system were failed to be considered in the real world case studies there are often multiple objectives independently controlled by different decision makers at different decision making levels such complexities might need bi level or even multi level management methods to deal with particularly for the bi level modeling technologies water resources management was one of the hottest areas that they were applied to a number of research on model development and case studies were conducted in the past few years for example lv et al 2010 developed an interval fuzzy bi level programming approach for planning water resources management system xu et al 2013 proposed a bi level programming model with fuzzy random variables for tackling a regional water resources allocation problem on the basis of water rights distribution in a river basin li et al 2015 developed a two level linear fractional water management model based on interactive fuzzy programming which could solve multi objective problems quantitatively xu et al 2016 proposed an optimization method with an integrated bi level structure and a dynamic strategy to achieve more effective and efficient water transfers and allocations for disaster mitigation in drought emergencies in addition to the application to water resource management some researchers combined the water and energy management in their research to determine the applicability of bi level programming to water energy nexus for instance a bi level decision model was developed which improved upon the existing studies by integration of bi level programming into energy water nexus management the developed model represented a methodological contribution to the challenge of sequential decision making in energy water nexus through provision of an integrated modeling framework zhang and vesselinov 2016 through these research reports it can be observed that bi level programming model is a very effective tool to deal with the problems with a hierarchy structure of upper and lower level decision makers i e uldm and lldm respectively however applications of such an effective method to the water environmental management especially the agricultural nps pollution management have been rarely reported due to the conflicts between the objectives of the decision makers in different levels e g farmers and government officials in agricultural nps management system agricultural nps management system has a nature of two levels which is difficult for the conventional methods to address introducing a bi level programming model to the management process of agricultural nps mitigation can help make sounder decisions in watershed management moreover in the management process of agricultural nps pollution it is necessary to efficiently determine the discharge amounts of pollutions loads including total nitrogen and phosphorus tn and tp with an advantage of having fewer parameters and requiring less data export coefficient model ecm was selected in this research to estimate these two loads ding et al 2010 mattikalli and richards 1996 ming et al 2004 wu et al 2016 due to its high computational efficiency ecm can be easily embedded in an optimization framework thus the objective of this research is to develop an export coefficient based inexact fuzzy bi level multi objective programming ec ifblmop model to deal with the complexities and uncertainties in agricultural systems through incorporating export coefficient model interval parameter programming ipp and fuzzy parameter programming fpp within a bi level multi objective programming framework the proposed ec ifblmop model can effectively deal with the multiple uncertainties in agricultural systems expressed as discrete intervals and fuzzy membership functions also the cooperation and gaming relationship between bi level decision makers can be fully considered in the model as the preferences of decision makers at both levels can be embedded in the optimization framework through setting different tolerance levels then the proposed ec ifblmop model will be applied to a real world case study in a subcatchment in the upper stream watershed of the miyun reservoir in north china to demonstrate its potential applicability the solutions will generate a set of decision alternatives for both the upper and lower level decision makers to identify the optimal management strategies which is the tradeoff between the two level objectives and between system optimality and reliability also the optimal results obtained after the implementation of such strategies will satisfy the relevant stakeholders within the study system 2 methodology 2 1 formulation of an inexact fuzzy bi level multi objective programming ifblmop model assume that there are two levels in a hierarchy structure with upper and lower level decision makers let the vector of decision variables x x 1 x 2 r n be partitioned between the two planners the upper and lower level decision makers control the vectors x 1 r n 1 and x 2 r n 2 respectively where n n 1 n 2 furthermore assume that f i x 1 x 2 r n 1 r n 2 i 1 2 are the upper and the lower level vector objective functions respectively thus the bi level multi objective programming blmop problem of minimization type can be formulated as follows baky et al 2014 pramanik and dey 2011 upper level 1a min x 1 f 1 x 1 x 2 min x 1 f 11 x 1 x 2 f 12 x 1 x 2 f 1 m 1 x 1 x 2 lower level 1b min x 2 f 2 x 1 x 2 min x 2 f 21 x 1 x 2 f 22 x 1 x 2 f 2 m 2 x 1 x 2 subject to 1c a 1 x 1 a 2 x 2 b 1d x 1 0 x 2 0 where f ij x c 1 ij x 1 c 2 ij x 2 c 11 ij x 11 c 12 ij x 12 c 1 n 1 ij x 1 n 1 c 21 ij x 21 c 22 ij x 22 c 2 n 2 ij x 2 n 2 i 1 2 j 1 2 mi mi are the numbers of dm i s objective functions c k ij c k 1 ij c k 2 ij c kn k ij k 1 2 and c kn k ij are constants a i are the coefficient matrices of size m ni the control variables x 1 x 1 1 x 1 2 x 1 n 1 and x 2 x 2 1 x 2 2 x 2 n 2 and b is the n component column vector for simplicity the system constraints 1c and 1d will be denoted as s baky et al 2014 pramanik and dey 2011 in real world case studies system parameters and their interrelationships are extremely complicated as a result it is very difficult for managers to obtain precise information that can be expressed as deterministic values consequently a number of parameters can merely be described as multiple uncertain formats such as intervals with known lower and upper bounds and fuzzy sets with membership functions such uncertainties might be difficult for the conventional methods to deal with it is necessary to introduce effective uncertain optimization methods to deal with different types of uncertainties in the system thus interval parameter programming and fuzzy parameter programming are introduced to the blmop framework leading to an inexact fuzzy bi level multi objective programming ifblmop model as follows upper level 2a min x 1 f 1 x 1 x 2 min x 1 f 11 x 1 x 2 f 12 x 1 x 2 f 1 m 1 x 1 x 2 lower level 2b min x 2 f 2 x 1 x 2 min x 2 f 21 x 1 x 2 f 22 x 1 x 2 f 2 m 2 x 1 x 2 subject to 2c a 1 x 1 a 2 x 2 b 2d x 1 0 x 2 0 where f ij x c 1 ij x 1 c 2 ij x 2 c 11 ij x 11 c 12 ij x 12 c 1 n 1 ij x 1 n 1 c 21 ij x 21 c 22 ij x 22 c 2 n 2 ij x 2 n 2 i 1 2 j 1 2 m i x are interval numbers f f c and b are fuzzy bounded intervals 2 2 solution methods the solution of the proposed ifblmop model can be decomposed into three steps i e step 1 solving the interval parameter programming step 2 solving the fuzzy parameter programming and step 3 solving the bi level multi objective programming 2 2 1 solution method for interval parameter programming based on the algorithms for minimization type objective function a two step solution method is proposed for solving interval parameter programming model with the aid of an interactive algorithm huang et al 1995 accordingly the foregoing problem can be reformulated as two submodels in the first step a set of submodels corresponding to f can be formulated as follows 3a min f j 1 k 1 c j x j j k 1 1 n c j x j subject to 3b j 1 k 1 a ij sign a ij x j j k 1 1 n a ij sign a ij x j b j 3c x j x j 0 where x j j 1 2 k 1 and x j j k 1 1 k 1 1 n are the decision variables with negative and positive coefficients in the objective functions sign a ij 1 if a ij 0 1 if a ij 0 then the optimal solutions x j opt j 1 2 k 1 and x j opt j k 1 1 k 1 1 n can be obtained from the model 3 in the second step another set of submodels corresponding to f can be formulated as follows 4a min f j 1 k 1 c j x j j k 1 1 n c j x j subject to 4b j 1 k 1 a ij sign a ij x j j k 1 1 n a ij sign a ij x j b j 4c x j x j opt j 1 2 k 1 4d 0 x j x j opt j k 1 1 k 1 1 n based on the above submodel x j opt j 1 2 k 1 and x j opt j k 1 1 k 1 1 n can be obtained then the interval solution can be obtained by integrating the solutions of above two submodels 2 2 2 solution method for fuzzy parameter programming to transform the fuzzy parameters into deterministic ones a prescribed value of Œ± will be introduced to the model for the objective functions of the model the optimal solution of uldm and lldm when determined in isolation will be considered as the aspiration level of the respective fuzzy objective goal thus for a prescribed value of Œ± the problem can be transformed into the following one upper level 5a min x 1 f 1 x Œ± l min x 1 f 11 x Œ± l f 12 x Œ± l f 1 m 1 x Œ± l lower level 5b min x 2 f 2 x Œ± l min x 2

their right hand sides i m 1 m 2 denotes the inequality constraints whose left hand sides are less than or equal to their right hand sides i m 2 m denotes equality constraints 2 2 3 solution method for bi level multi objective programming according to pramanik 2012 a modified fuzzy goal programming fgp model will be utilized to solve the transformed deterministic problem the proposed fgp formulation for solving bi level multi objective programming model can be presented as 6a min œÅ j 1 m 1 w 1 j d 1 j j 1 m 2 w 2 j d 2 j subject to 6b Œº 1 j f 1 j x Œ± l d 1 j 1 j 1 2 m 2 6c Œº 2 j f

Œ≥2 j Œ¥2 j j 1 2 n 2 are the fixed lower and upper bounds of the decision variables provided by lldm and uldm with Œ≥1 j x 1 j Œ¥1 j and Œ≥2 j x 2 j Œ¥2 j Œº ij f ij x Œ± l is the membership function for uldm and lldm the numerical weights i e w ij corresponding to negative deviational variables can be calculated as follows w ij 1 f ij w Œ± u f ij b Œ± l i 1 2 j 1 2 m i pramanik and dey 2011 pramanik and roy 2006 by solving model 6 the solution satisficing both the uldm and lldm is then obtained the detailed solving process and transforming steps are shown in the supplementary materials the scheme of the modeling methodology is shown in fig 1 3 application of the proposed ifblmop model to a real world agricultural nps pollution management system 3 1 overview of the study area the miyun reservoir is the largest reservoir in north china it is the only surface water source of the beijing city the maximum storage capacity annual mean runoff and water supply amounts of the reservoir are 4375 9844 and 7725 million m3 respectively the mean depth of the reservoir is approximately 30 m in recent decades the water environment of the miyun reservoir has been destroyed in a certain extent liang et al 2016 ou et al 2016 particularly frequent agricultural activities have been taken on the sloping fields leading to increasing amounts of nitrogen n and phosphorus p released from agricultural areas to the miyun reservoir and resulting in the water eutrophication wang et al 2008 thus the reduction of agricultural nps n and p in this watershed is of great significance for water resource protection the upstream watershed area of the miyun reservoir is approximately 15 788 km2 a representative subcatchment the qingshui river watershed n40 23 40 33 e117 02 e117 23 was selected in this research as the case study area to determine the applicability of the proposed model this area is located in the warm temperate zone with a semi humid continental monsoon climate the long term meteorological records show that the mean annual temperature is 10 5 c and the mean values of the minimum and maximum temperatures are 18 and 38 c respectively the annual precipitation varies significantly with a mean value of 669 mm also the precipitation distributes unevenly during the year approximately 80 85 of the total annual precipitation falls between june and september on the contrary the average annual evaporation e g 1800 630 and 1200 mm for water surface cropland and vegetable fields is much larger than the annual precipitation only the rainfall in july and august can meet the evaporation of cropland liang et al 2016 ma et al 2010 wang et al 2012 xu et al 2010 the annual average frost free period and sunshine hours are 187 days and 2800 h respectively the topography of this area is moderate and low mountains hills and valleys according to chinese soil taxonomy the soil type of this area contains meadow brown cinnamon and calcareous soils group 1995 the main land use types are forest grassland and cropland accounting for 70 81 18 69 and 8 94 of the total area respectively to mitigate the agricultural nps pollution proper land use adjustment and several best management practices bmps are proposed in this research because the forest grassland and cropland are the main land use types in the qingshui river watershed these three types of land use are considered in this research also based on the characteristics of the study area three types of bmps are proposed which are 1 contour farming with conservation tillage e g zero tillage and cover crop 2 filtration strip construction with a width of 5 15 m and 3 sloping grassland protection e g herbage regeneration and forbid shrub cutting in addition only the tn and tp loads are taken into consideration in this research with an area of approximately 562 7 km2 the study area was divided into 4 zones based on the dem fig 2 the data were collected from related research statistical yearbook historical records and field investigations table 1 lists the current areas and the export coefficients of different land use types and the river length in each agricultural zone of qingshui river subcatchment table 2 lists the unit net benefits of different land use types table 3 lists the agricultural nps pollution reduction efficiency and the conducting costs of bmps according to the general plans for the land use of miyun county 2006 2020 forest should account for more than 80 of the total area of the mountainous region in the upstream the miyun reservoir consequently part of cropland and grassland should be converted to forestland in this research three scenarios were set to determine the influence of different land use adjustment schemes 1 80 and 20 2 50 and 50 and 3 20 and 80 of the reforesting area would be contributed by cropland and grassland respectively also considering that individual farmers may have different opinions on the bmp implementation three scenarios were set to analyze the influence of different implementing levels of bmps 1 20 of the current cropland and grassland and 10 of the current river length 2 50 of the current cropland and grassland and 15 of the current river length and 3 80 of the current cropland and grassland and 20 of the current river length would be used to implement the bmps the upper and lower level decision makers preference for the target areas of different land use types and the implementing levels of bmps in each agricultural zone of qingshui river watershed are shown in table 4 the total annual discharge permits of tn and tp were set as 20 768 26 432 30 208 and 276 351 401 kg respectively based on the current discharge amounts of agricultural nps n and p and the suggested reduction targets 3 2 modeling formulation the problem under consideration is how to adjust the land use patterns and implement the bmps to achieve a balance between maximizing the net system benefit of the entire system and minimizing the bmp implementation costs of each subarea in the decision process the upper level decision maker i e government sector at watershed level would control the adjustment schemes of land use patterns on the contrary the implementing levels of bmps would be controlled by the lower level one i e farmers at subarea levels both the target areas of different land use types and the implementing levels of bmps should be determined through setting limits of tn and tp discharged from the entire agricultural system concurrently in the management process of agricultural nps pollution management in a watershed it is necessary to efficiently determine the discharge amounts of tn and tp thus through introducing export coefficient model ecm a highly effective agricultural nps pollution estimation tool to the above optimization framework an export coefficient based inexact fuzzy bi level multi objective programming ec ifblmop model for agricultural nonpoint source pollution management can be formulated as

discussion the results of the model showed that if the lower level decision makers follow scenario 1 no feasible solutions would be obtained feasible solutions could be obtained when the decision makers followed scenarios 2 and 3 such results means that when the lower level decision makers have a weak propensity for water environmental protection there would be not any optimized land use patterns and bmp implementing levels that could simultaneously satisfy the objectives of the upper and lower level decision makers with the enhancement of the low level decision makers propensity for water environmental protection e g making their decisions following scenarios 2 and 3 the objectives of the decision makers in both decision making levels could be simultaneously achieved detailed results obtained from the model when the low level decision makers follow scenarios 2 and 3 are analyzed below 4 1 land use patterns the upper level decision maker s preference would have great influence on the optimized target areas of cropland forestland and grassland in the qingshui river watershed on the contrary the lower level decision maker s preference would not have any influence on the optimized target areas of each land use types which means that the lower level decision maker s propensity for bmp implementation would not significantly affect the optimized land use patterns in the study area currently different Œ± cuts would not have influence on the optimized land use patterns either fig 3 shows the optimized land use patterns under different upper level decision scenarios for example when the upper level policy makers decide that the reforesting area should be equally contributed by cropland and grassland the final areas of cropland forestland and grassland after the optimization of land use patterns would be 211 12 332 and 943 ha in zone 1 214 9432 and 1546 ha in zone 2 1151 18 523 and 5064 ha in zone 3 and 1267 4755 and 867 ha in zone 4 respectively to satisfy the forest area requirements in the general plans for the land use of miyun county partial cropland and grassland areas would be reforested in each zones such transformation would help decision maker get a balance between maximizing the net system benefits and reducing the agricultural nps n and p loadings 4 2 bmp implementing levels both the upper and lower level decision makers preferences would have great influence on the optimized bmp implementing levels specifically when the lower level decision makers have a medium propensity for water environmental protection i e making their decisions following scenario 2 the different preference of the upper level policy makers would result in significantly different bmp implementing levels table 5 for example if the upper level policy makers prefer to reforest on cropland i e make decisions following scenario 1 the areas of contour farming with conservation tillage would be 123 93 143 126 53 146 165 53 191 and 856 ha in zones 1 2 3 and 4 respectively such areas would be 162 163 5 1375 5 and 856 ha if the upper level decision makers decide to mainly reforest on grassland with the upper level policy maker s preference changing from reforesting on cropland to grassland the implementing levels of contour farming with conservation tillage would gradually increase on the contrary an opposite trend was observed for the implementing level of sloping pasture protection for instance if the upper level policy makers prefer to transform cropland to forest the areas of sloping pasture that need to be protected would be 528 829 5 3332 and 656 ha in zones 1 2 3 and 4 respectively such areas would be 528 829 5 3224 57 3332 and 471 43 600 ha if the upper level policy makers prefer to transform grassland to forest particularly the implementing levels of filtration strips construction in zone 1 would be 0 in the three scenarios which reveals that compared with the other two bmps filtration strips construction is not cost effective for nps mitigation in this zone moreover different Œ± cuts would not have significant influences on the implementing levels of contour farming with conservation tillage and sloping pasture protection it could merely affect the constructing lengths of filtration strips along the river in zone 2 for example when the upper level policy maker decides that the main reforested area should be contributed by cropland the constructing lengths of filtration strips along the river in zone 2 would be 174 57 1305 43 234 10 1374 87 and 293 62 1444 32 m when the Œ± cuts are 0 25 0 5 and 0 75 respectively those would be 376 45 1667 65 435 98 1747 10 and 495 5 1816 54 m when the upper level policy maker prefers that the main reforested area should be contributed by grassland such varying pattern can reflect that compared with the other three zones zone 2 is the most cost effective one for constructing filtration strips when the allowable total discharge amounts of nps pollutants are relatively low when the lower level decision makers have a strong propensity for water environmental protection i e making their decisions following scenario 3 the preference of upper level policy maker would have a similar influence of on the bmp implementing levels table 6 for example the areas of contour farming with conservation tillage would be increased from 123 93 143 126 53 146 165 53 191 and 866 67 1000 ha to 241 80 259 20 244 40 261 60 1829 53 2111 and 1329 47 1369 60 ha in the zones 1 2 3 and 4 respectively if the preference of upper level policy makers changes from reforesting on cropland to grassland also the areas of sloping pasture that need to be protected would be decreased from 1268 14 1327 20 4733 14 5331 20 and 891 1049 60 ha to 1161 29 1327 20 3224 57 4104 and 471 43 600 ha in the zones 2 3 and 4 respectively concurrently the influences of different Œ± cuts would be relatively greater in this scenario although different Œ± cuts would not significantly affect the implementing levels of contour farming with conservation tillage they would have significant influences on both the protection areas of sloping pasture in zone 1 and the constructing lengths of filtration strips along the river in zone 2 for instance when the upper level policy maker prefers to reforest on cropland the protection areas of sloping pasture in zone 1 would be 351 21 844 80 440 50 844 80 and 529 79 844 80 ha when the Œ± cuts are 0 25 0 5 and 0 75 respectively those would be 244 36 844 80 333 64 844 80 and 422 93 844 80 ha when the upper level policy maker prefers to reforest on grassland thus the implementing levels of these two bmps in zones 1 and 2 would increase with the increasing Œ± cut value this trend revealed that when the allowable total discharge amounts of nps pollutants decreased constructing filtration strips in the zone 2 and protecting the sloping pasture in the zone 1 would be first selected to mitigate the excessive discharge pollution loads which meant that the two bmps implemented in these two zones would be relatively more cost effective 4 3 net benefits of the entire system different land use patterns and bmp implementing levels under various scenarios would lead to varying net system benefits the net benefit of the entire system would be simultaneously affected by the upper and lower level decision makers preferences fig 4 specifically when the lower level decision makers follow scenario 2 the net system benefit would gradually decrease with the changes of upper level decision maker s preference from reforesting on cropland to grassland for example if the upper level decision makers follow scenario 1 the net system benefits would be 4 88 5 72 107 when the Œ± cuts are 0 25 that would be reduced to 4 75 5 68 107 if the upper level decision makers follow scenario 3 at the same time different Œ± cuts would also have influence on the net system benefit with the increase of Œ± cut the net system benefit would show a decreasing trend for instance it would reduce from 4 86 5 72 to 4 80 5 65 107 when the Œ± cut increases from 0 25 to 0 75 if the upper level decision makers think the reforesting area should be equally contributed by cropland and grassland concurrently when the lower level decision makers follow scenario 3 the influence of different Œ± cuts on the net system benefits would be similar for each scenario the net system benefit would decrease with the increase of Œ± cut such variations of net system benefit with different Œ± cuts can reflect that when the allowable discharge amounts of nps pollutants are reduced more bmps should be conducted to mitigate the excess nps pollution leading to the decrease in net system benefits at the same time the influence of different land use adjustment patterns i e different upper level decision scenarios would be different specifically the upper bound of the net system benefits would slightly increase with the changes of upper level decision maker s preference from reforesting on cropland to grassland however the lower bound of the net system benefits would show a trend of first increasing and then decreasing for example the net system benefits would be 4 98 5 756 4 99 5 760 and 4 95 5 764 107 for the three upper level decision scenarios when the Œ± cut is 0 25 compared with the net system benefit when the lower level decision makers following scenario 2 it would be higher if the lower decision makers follow this scenario thus the net benefit of the entire system is the consequence of joint influences of the upper and lower level decision makers in general the preferences of the lower level decision makers would have more significant influence a stronger propensity of the lower level decision makers to protect water environment would lead to a higher net system benefit 4 4 implementing costs of each subarea the bmp implementing cost of zone 3 would be highest in the four zones while that of zone 1 would be the lowest the bmp implementing costs of different zones would show different variation trends when the upper and lower level decision makers follow different scenarios fig 5 specifically when the lower level decision makers follow scenario 2 the implementing costs of zones 1 2 and 4 would show an increasing trend when the reforesting area on cropland decreases i e the upper level decision maker s preference changes from scenario 1 to 3 for example if the upper level policy makers prefer to transform cropland to forest the total costs of the bmp implementation in the zones 1 2 and 4 would be 1 26 1 81 2 67 11 44 and 6 07 15 31 105 respectively when the Œ± cut is 0 25 the costs would gradually increase to 1 37 1 88 3 78 14 05 and 9 91 21 52 105 when the upper level policy makers change their preference to reforest on grassland however the implementing cost of zone 3 would show a first decreasing and then increasing trend with the change of the upper level decision maker s preference for instance when the Œ± cut is 0 50 the total implementing cost would decrease from 1 78 3 998 106 to 1 76 3 994 106 and then increase to 2 12 4 84 106 when the preference of upper level policy maker changes from scenario 1 to scenarios 2 and 3 at the same time different Œ± cuts would significantly affect the total implementing cost of each zone with the increase of Œ± cut both the upper and lower bounds of the costs would show an increasing trend taking zone 4 as an example if the upper and lower level decision makers follow scenarios 1 and 2 respectively the total implementing costs would be increased from 6 07 15 31 105 to 6 16 15 49 and 6 26 15 66 105 when the Œ± cut increases from 0 25 to 0 5 and 0 75 such variation trends indicate that the lower level decision makers need to pay more for the water protection with the improvement of the surrounding water environment requirement when the lower level decision makers follow scenario 3 there would be some difference for the implementing costs of the four zones fig 5 to be specific for the zones 1 and 4 the similar increasing trends would be observed for the implementing cost when the reforesting area of cropland decreases however for the zones 2 and 3 the variation trends would be changed in terms of the implementing cost of zone 2 it would show a first decreasing and then increasing trend that of zone 3 would show an increasing trend similarly both the upper and lower bounds of the total costs in the four zones would show an increasing trend with the increase of Œ± cut through comparing the total costs of the four zones under different lower level decision scenarios it can be found that except for the zone 1 the total costs of the zones 2 3 and 4 would be much lower when the lower level decision makers have strong propensity for water environment protection thus a wide range of allowable bmp implementing levels provided by the lower level decision makers would not necessarily lead to a high cost because different bmps might not be equally cost effective and the total cost of each zone mainly depends on the implementing levels of multiple bmps the increase of the high cost effective bmp implementing level might result in a decrease in the total cost in this research when the propensity of the lower level decision makers to protect the water environment becomes stronger i e following scenario 3 to provide a wider range of allowable bmp implementing levels the implementing levels of contour farming with conservation tillage in the four zones would increase and those of sloping pasture protection in zones 2 3 and 4 would also increase conversely the implementing levels of filtration strips construction in zones 2 3 and 4 would decrease such variations indicate that contour farming with conservation tillage and sloping pasture protection would be more cost effective than filtration strips construction for the zone 1 the upper bound of the cost would be much higher and the lower bound would be a little lower such different variation trend mainly due to the special bmp implementing scheme i e no filtration strips would be constructed in this area only the area of sloping pasture protection changed with the lower level decision maker s preference however it can also indicate that contour farming with conservation tillage and sloping pasture protection would be more cost effective than filtration strips construction because the model results show the former two types of bmps would be first selected when the allowable discharge amounts of nps pollutants are limited 5 conclusion agricultural nonpoint source nps pollution has become the primary cause leading to water environmental deterioration due to the multiple uncertainties and complexities in the system it is quite important to develop an advanced integrated management model for supporting agricultural nps pollution control in this research an export coefficient based inexact fuzzy bi level multi objective programming ec ifblmop model was developed through integrating export coefficient model ecm interval parameter programming ipp and fuzzy parameter programming fpp within a bi level multi objective programming framework the model has the following advantages and improvements a uncertainties expressed as discrete intervals and fuzzy membership functions can be effectively addressed through coupling the ipp and fpp methods b system inherent structure can be reflected through introducing a bi level model framework c the cooperation and gaming relationship of the decision makers at different levels can be fully considered and d bi level multi objective problem in the agricultural system can be solved the proposed model was then applied to a real world case study in the upper stream watershed of the miyun reservoir in north china to demonstrate its potential applicability the results of the case study showed that land use patterns and bmp implementing levels would be significantly optimized to achieve a balance between the objectives of the upper and lower level decision makers when the allowable discharge amounts of nps pollutants were limited also results corresponding to different decision scenarios could provide the upper and lower level decision makers with a set of decision alternatives to help identify the most appropriate management strategy the model has a good applicability and can be effectively utilized for agricultural nps pollution management the proposed ec ifblmop model is an attempt to handle the multiple complexities and uncertainties in agricultural systems although the two level structure of the system was considered it is still unable to fully reflect the structure of a real case system also the model has some limitations to deal with the uncertainties expressed as probability density function thus in the future research stochastic mathematical programming methods will be introduced to the bi level or even multi level optimization framework to better reflect the uncertainties and complexities in real world cases acknowledgements this work was financially supported by the national

has a good applicability and can be effectively utilized for agricultural nps pollution management keywords agricultural nonpoint source pollution bi level multi objective programming intervals fuzzy sets export coefficient model optimization management 1 introduction water is one of the most important material resources which is indispensable to human survival and development eliasson 2015 hu et al 2010 however with the expanding of human society and economic activity continuous water quality degradation has become one of the major factors restricting human sustainable development arenas s√°nchez et al 2016 zhou et al 2014 particularly with the gradual control of point source pollution the influence of nonpoint source nps pollution on water quality has become increasingly prominent carkovic et al 2015 chen et al 2016 many research reports in different countries and regions have proved that nps pollution especially the agricultural nps pollution is the primary cause leading to water environmental deterioration carkovic et al 2015 haregeweyn and yohannes 2003 pionke et al 2000 shen et al 2012 turnbull et al 2010 volk et al 2016 improvement of surface water environment depended on the effective management and control of agricultural nps pollution which has become the important and difficult point in water environmental research evan et al 2014 geng et al 2015 tan et al 2010 2013 wu et al 2016 thus it is very urgent and important to develop some advanced methods and seek the optimal management schemes for agricultural nps pollution control in the processes of agricultural nps pollution management different groups at different decision making levels may hold distinct opinions on water quality protection liu et al 2013 for example famers at the lower decision making level may hope to maintain or even increase the area of cropland and reduce the implementing levels of different best management practices bmps to increase the agricultural benefit and cut down the bmp implementing costs such decisions might lead to increasing amounts of pollutants released and transported to the downstream water bodies on the contrary government officials at the upper decision making level may conventionally focus on the balance between increasing agricultural system benefits and mitigating nps pollution through changing a certain area of agricultural land to forests in order to satisfy certain nutrient discharge permits thus it is a great challenge to make out sound strategies which can simultaneously satisfy the demands of bi level decision makers concurrently agricultural systems are very complicated uncertainties may exist in many system components processes factors and their interrelationships cai et al 2009a b 2011 cui et al 2015 li et al 2009 luo et al 2006 rong et al 2017 parameters in agricultural system are difficult to be given as deterministic values in the process of nps pollution management consequently much information might merely be obtained as intervals and fuzzy numbers dai et al 2016 huang et al 2012 for instance some parameters such as target areas of each land use type and implementing levels of bmps can only be obtained as discrete intervals with deterministic upper and lower bounds also some obtained information e g the discharge permits of nps pollutants can only be expressed as fuzzy sets with known possibility distributions in addition for some interval parameters its upper and lower bounds are still uncertain e g the land use benefit and bmp implementing cost coefficients resulting in dual uncertainties e g fuzzy bounded intervals therefore in order to effectively address such complexities and uncertainties it is very important to develop a bi level method under multiple uncertainties when conducting research on agricultural nps pollution management in recent years there have been extensive studies on water resources management with focus on nps pollution reduction particularly various integrated optimization models were proposed to deal with multiple uncertainties in agricultural nps pollution management systems ji et al 2014 liu et al 2015 for example an inexact agricultural water quality management model was developed to identify the optimal cropping area applied manure fertilizer amount and livestock husbandry size within an agricultural system zhang et al 2009 a radial interval chance constrained programming riccp method was proposed to explore the most profit agricultural development strategies while restricting environmental impacts to an acceptable level tan et al 2011 as the research continues on more comprehensive models and supporting systems were developed to support water environmental management dong et al 2014 zhang et al 2011 in addition to the development of optimization models some researchers tried to couple the simulation and optimization framework to better describe the uncertainties in the processes of pollution generation and management zeng et al 2016 for instance a robust simulation optimization modeling system and an inexact simulation based stochastic optimization method were successively developed for supporting agricultural nonpoint source nps effluent trading planning zhang et al 2014 zhang et al 2015 thus these previous research on agricultural nps pollution management was mainly focused on dealing with the multiple uncertainties in the systems however system complexities such as the inherent structure of a real world case system were failed to be considered in the real world case studies there are often multiple objectives independently controlled by different decision makers at different decision making levels such complexities might need bi level or even multi level management methods to deal with particularly for the bi level modeling technologies water resources management was one of the hottest areas that they were applied to a number of research on model development and case studies were conducted in the past few years for example lv et al 2010 developed an interval fuzzy bi level programming approach for planning water resources management system xu et al 2013 proposed a bi level programming model with fuzzy random variables for tackling a regional water resources allocation problem on the basis of water rights distribution in a river basin li et al 2015 developed a two level linear fractional water management model based on interactive fuzzy programming which could solve multi objective problems quantitatively xu et al 2016 proposed an optimization method with an integrated bi level structure and a dynamic strategy to achieve more effective and efficient water transfers and allocations for disaster mitigation in drought emergencies in addition to the application to water resource management some researchers combined the water and energy management in their research to determine the applicability of bi level programming to water energy nexus for instance a bi level decision model was developed which improved upon the existing studies by integration of bi level programming into energy water nexus management the developed model represented a methodological contribution to the challenge of sequential decision making in energy water nexus through provision of an integrated modeling framework zhang and vesselinov 2016 through these research reports it can be observed that bi level programming model is a very effective tool to deal with the problems with a hierarchy structure of upper and lower level decision makers i e uldm and lldm respectively however applications of such an effective method to the water environmental management especially the agricultural nps pollution management have been rarely reported due to the conflicts between the objectives of the decision makers in different levels e g farmers and government officials in agricultural nps management system agricultural nps management system has a nature of two levels which is difficult for the conventional methods to address introducing a bi level programming model to the management process of agricultural nps mitigation can help make sounder decisions in watershed management moreover in the management process of agricultural nps pollution it is necessary to efficiently determine the discharge amounts of pollutions loads including total nitrogen and phosphorus tn and tp with an advantage of having fewer parameters and requiring less data export coefficient model ecm was selected in this research to estimate these two loads ding et al 2010 mattikalli and richards 1996 ming et al 2004 wu et al 2016 due to its high computational efficiency ecm can be easily embedded in an optimization framework thus the objective of this research is to develop an export coefficient based inexact fuzzy bi level multi objective programming ec ifblmop model to deal with the complexities and uncertainties in agricultural systems through incorporating export coefficient model interval parameter programming ipp and fuzzy parameter programming fpp within a bi level multi objective programming framework the proposed ec ifblmop model can effectively deal with the multiple uncertainties in agricultural systems expressed as discrete intervals and fuzzy membership functions also the cooperation and gaming relationship between bi level decision makers can be fully considered in the model as the preferences of decision makers at both levels can be embedded in the optimization framework through setting different tolerance levels then the proposed ec ifblmop model will be applied to a real world case study in a subcatchment in the upper stream watershed of the miyun reservoir in north china to demonstrate its potential applicability the solutions will generate a set of decision alternatives for both the upper and lower level decision makers to identify the optimal management strategies which is the tradeoff between the two level objectives and between system optimality and reliability also the optimal results obtained after the implementation of such strategies will satisfy the relevant stakeholders within the study system 2 methodology 2 1 formulation of an inexact fuzzy bi level multi objective programming ifblmop model assume that there are two levels in a hierarchy structure with upper and lower level decision makers let the vector of decision variables x x 1 x 2 r n be partitioned between the two planners the upper and lower level decision makers control the vectors x 1 r n 1 and x 2 r n 2 respectively where n n 1 n 2 furthermore assume that f i x 1 x 2 r n 1 r n 2 i 1 2 are the upper and the lower level vector objective functions respectively thus the bi level multi objective programming blmop problem of minimization type can be formulated as follows baky et al 2014 pramanik and dey 2011 upper level 1a min x 1 f 1 x 1 x 2 min x 1 f 11 x 1 x 2 f 12 x 1 x 2 f 1 m 1 x 1 x 2 lower level 1b min x 2 f 2 x 1 x 2 min x 2 f 21 x 1 x 2 f 22 x 1 x 2 f 2 m 2 x 1 x 2 subject to 1c a 1 x 1 a 2 x 2 b 1d x 1 0 x 2 0 where f ij x c 1 ij x 1 c 2 ij x 2 c 11 ij x 11 c 12 ij x 12 c 1 n 1 ij x 1 n 1 c 21 ij x 21 c 22 ij x 22 c 2 n 2 ij x 2 n 2 i 1 2 j 1 2 mi mi are the numbers of dm i s objective functions c k ij c k 1 ij c k 2 ij c kn k ij k 1 2 and c kn k ij are constants a i are the coefficient matrices of size m ni the control variables x 1 x 1 1 x 1 2 x 1 n 1 and x 2 x 2 1 x 2 2 x 2 n 2 and b is the n component column vector for simplicity the system constraints 1c and 1d will be denoted as s baky et al 2014 pramanik and dey 2011 in real world case studies system parameters and their interrelationships are extremely complicated as a result it is very difficult for managers to obtain precise information that can be expressed as deterministic values consequently a number of parameters can merely be described as multiple uncertain formats such as intervals with known lower and upper bounds and fuzzy sets with membership functions such uncertainties might be difficult for the conventional methods to deal with it is necessary to introduce effective uncertain optimization methods to deal with different types of uncertainties in the system thus interval parameter programming and fuzzy parameter programming are introduced to the blmop framework leading to an inexact fuzzy bi level multi objective programming ifblmop model as follows upper level 2a min x 1 f 1 x 1 x 2 min x 1 f 11 x 1 x 2 f 12 x 1 x 2 f 1 m 1 x 1 x 2 lower level 2b min x 2 f 2 x 1 x 2 min x 2 f 21 x 1 x 2 f 22 x 1 x 2 f 2 m 2 x 1 x 2 subject to 2c a 1 x 1 a 2 x 2 b 2d x 1 0 x 2 0 where f ij x c 1 ij x 1 c 2 ij x 2 c 11 ij x 11 c 12 ij x 12 c 1 n 1 ij x 1 n 1 c 21 ij x 21 c 22 ij x 22 c 2 n 2 ij x 2 n 2 i 1 2 j 1 2 m i x are interval numbers f f c and b are fuzzy bounded intervals 2 2 solution methods the solution of the proposed ifblmop model can be decomposed into three steps i e step 1 solving the interval parameter programming step 2 solving the fuzzy parameter programming and step 3 solving the bi level multi objective programming 2 2 1 solution method for interval parameter programming based on the algorithms for minimization type objective function a two step solution method is proposed for solving interval parameter programming model with the aid of an interactive algorithm huang et al 1995 accordingly the foregoing problem can be reformulated as two submodels in the first step a set of submodels corresponding to f can be formulated as follows 3a min f j 1 k 1 c j x j j k 1 1 n c j x j subject to 3b j 1 k 1 a ij sign a ij x j j k 1 1 n a ij sign a ij x j b j 3c x j x j 0 where x j j 1 2 k 1 and x j j k 1 1 k 1 1 n are the decision variables with negative and positive coefficients in the objective functions sign a ij 1 if a ij 0 1 if a ij 0 then the optimal solutions x j opt j 1 2 k 1 and x j opt j k 1 1 k 1 1 n can be obtained from the model 3 in the second step another set of submodels corresponding to f can be formulated as follows 4a min f j 1 k 1 c j x j j k 1 1 n c j x j subject to 4b j 1 k 1 a ij sign a ij x j j k 1 1 n a ij sign a ij x j b j 4c x j x j opt j 1 2 k 1 4d 0 x j x j opt j k 1 1 k 1 1 n based on the above submodel x j opt j 1 2 k 1 and x j opt j k 1 1 k 1 1 n can be obtained then the interval solution can be obtained by integrating the solutions of above two submodels 2 2 2 solution method for fuzzy parameter programming to transform the fuzzy parameters into deterministic ones a prescribed value of Œ± will be introduced to the model for the objective functions of the model the optimal solution of uldm and lldm when determined in isolation will be considered as the aspiration level of the respective fuzzy objective goal thus for a prescribed value of Œ± the problem can be transformed into the following one upper level 5a min x 1 f 1 x Œ± l min x 1 f 11 x Œ± l f 12 x Œ± l f 1 m 1 x Œ± l lower level 5b min x 2 f 2 x Œ± l min x 2

for bi level multi objective programming according to pramanik 2012 a modified fuzzy goal programming fgp model will be utilized to solve the transformed deterministic problem the proposed fgp formulation for solving bi level multi objective programming model can be presented as 6a min œÅ j 1 m 1 w 1 j d 1 j j 1 m 2 w 2 j d 2 j subject to 6b Œº 1 j f 1 j x Œ± l d 1 j 1 j 1 2 m 2 6c Œº 2 j f

pramanik and roy 2006 by solving model 6 the solution satisficing both the uldm and lldm is then obtained the detailed solving process and transforming steps are shown in the supplementary materials the scheme of the modeling methodology is shown in fig 1 3 application of the proposed ifblmop model to a real world agricultural nps pollution management system 3 1 overview of the study area the miyun reservoir is the largest reservoir in north china it is the only surface water source of the beijing city the maximum storage capacity annual mean runoff and water supply amounts of the reservoir are 4375 9844 and 7725 million m3 respectively the mean depth of the reservoir is approximately 30 m in recent decades the water environment of the miyun reservoir has been destroyed in a certain extent liang et al 2016 ou et al 2016 particularly frequent agricultural activities have been taken on the sloping fields leading to increasing amounts of nitrogen n and phosphorus p released from agricultural areas to the miyun reservoir and resulting in the water eutrophication wang et al 2008 thus the reduction of agricultural nps n and p in this watershed is of great significance for water resource protection the upstream watershed area of the miyun reservoir is approximately 15 788 km2 a representative subcatchment the qingshui river watershed n40 23 40 33 e117 02 e117 23 was selected in this research as the case study area to determine the applicability of the proposed model this area is located in the warm temperate zone with a semi humid continental monsoon climate the long term meteorological records show that the mean annual temperature is 10 5 c and the mean values of the minimum and maximum temperatures are 18 and 38 c respectively the annual precipitation varies significantly with a mean value of 669 mm also the precipitation distributes unevenly during the year approximately 80 85 of the total annual precipitation falls between june and september on the contrary the average annual evaporation e g 1800 630 and 1200 mm for water surface cropland and vegetable fields is much larger than the annual precipitation only the rainfall in july and august can meet the evaporation of cropland liang et al 2016 ma et al 2010 wang et al 2012 xu et al 2010 the annual average frost free period and sunshine hours are 187 days and 2800 h respectively the topography of this area is moderate and low mountains hills and valleys according to chinese soil taxonomy the soil type of this area contains meadow brown cinnamon and calcareous soils group 1995 the main land use types are forest grassland and cropland accounting for 70 81 18 69 and 8 94 of the total area respectively to mitigate the agricultural nps pollution proper land use adjustment and several best management practices bmps are proposed in this research because the forest grassland and cropland are the main land use types in the qingshui river watershed these three types of land use are considered in this research also based on the characteristics of the study area three types of bmps are proposed which are 1 contour farming with conservation tillage e g zero tillage and cover crop 2 filtration strip construction with a width of 5 15 m and 3 sloping grassland protection e g herbage regeneration and forbid shrub cutting in addition only the tn and tp loads are taken into consideration in this research with an area of approximately 562 7 km2 the study area was divided into 4 zones based on the dem fig 2 the data were collected from related research statistical yearbook historical records and field investigations table 1 lists the current areas and the export coefficients of different land use types and the river length in each agricultural zone of qingshui river subcatchment table 2 lists the unit net benefits of different land use types table 3 lists the agricultural nps pollution reduction efficiency and the conducting costs of bmps according to the general plans for the land use of miyun county 2006 2020 forest should account for more than 80 of the total area of the mountainous region in the upstream the miyun reservoir consequently part of cropland and grassland should be converted to forestland in this research three scenarios were set to determine the influence of different land use adjustment schemes 1 80 and 20 2 50 and 50 and 3 20 and 80 of the reforesting area would be contributed by cropland and grassland respectively also considering that individual farmers may have different opinions on the bmp implementation three scenarios were set to analyze the influence of different implementing levels of bmps 1 20 of the current cropland and grassland and 10 of the current river length 2 50 of the current cropland and grassland and 15 of the current river length and 3 80 of the current cropland and grassland and 20 of the current river length would be used to implement the bmps the upper and lower level decision makers preference for the target areas of different land use types and the implementing levels of bmps in each agricultural zone of qingshui river watershed are shown in table 4 the total annual discharge permits of tn and tp were set as 20 768 26 432 30 208 and 276 351 401 kg respectively based on the current discharge amounts of agricultural nps n and p and the suggested reduction targets 3 2 modeling formulation the problem under consideration is how to adjust the land use patterns and implement the bmps to achieve a balance between maximizing the net system benefit of the entire system and minimizing the bmp implementation costs of each subarea in the decision process the upper level decision maker i e government sector at watershed level would control the adjustment schemes of land use patterns on the contrary the implementing levels of bmps would be controlled by the lower level one i e farmers at subarea levels both the target areas of different land use types and the implementing levels of bmps should be determined through setting limits of tn and tp discharged from the entire agricultural system concurrently in the management process of agricultural nps pollution management in a watershed it is necessary to efficiently determine the discharge amounts of tn and tp thus through introducing export coefficient model ecm a highly effective agricultural nps pollution estimation tool to the above optimization framework an export coefficient based inexact fuzzy bi level multi objective programming ec ifblmop model for agricultural nonpoint source pollution management can be formulated as

discussion the results of the model showed that if the lower level decision makers follow scenario 1 no feasible solutions would be obtained feasible solutions could be obtained when the decision makers followed scenarios 2 and 3 such results means that when the lower level decision makers have a weak propensity for water environmental protection there would be not any optimized land use patterns and bmp implementing levels that could simultaneously satisfy the objectives of the upper and lower level decision makers with the enhancement of the low level decision makers propensity for water environmental protection e g making their decisions following scenarios 2 and 3 the objectives of the decision makers in both decision making levels could be simultaneously achieved detailed results obtained from the model when the low level decision makers follow scenarios 2 and 3 are analyzed below 4 1 land use patterns the upper level decision maker s preference would have great influence on the optimized target areas of cropland forestland and grassland in the qingshui river watershed on the contrary the lower level decision maker s preference would not have any influence on the optimized target areas of each land use types which means that the lower level decision maker s propensity for bmp implementation would not significantly affect the optimized land use patterns in the study area currently different Œ± cuts would not have influence on the optimized land use patterns either fig 3 shows the optimized land use patterns under different upper level decision scenarios for example when the upper level policy makers decide that the reforesting area should be equally contributed by cropland and grassland the final areas of cropland forestland and grassland after the optimization of land use patterns would be 211 12 332 and 943 ha in zone 1 214 9432 and 1546 ha in zone 2 1151 18 523 and 5064 ha in zone 3 and 1267 4755 and 867 ha in zone 4 respectively to satisfy the forest area requirements in the general plans for the land use of miyun county partial cropland and grassland areas would be reforested in each zones such transformation would help decision maker get a balance between maximizing the net system benefits and reducing the agricultural nps n and p loadings 4 2 bmp implementing levels both the upper and lower level decision makers preferences would have great influence on the optimized bmp implementing levels specifically when the lower level decision makers have a medium propensity for water environmental protection i e making their decisions following scenario 2 the different preference of the upper level policy makers would result in significantly different bmp implementing levels table 5 for example if the upper level policy makers prefer to reforest on cropland i e make decisions following scenario 1 the areas of contour farming with conservation tillage would be 123 93 143 126 53 146 165 53 191 and 856 ha in zones 1 2 3 and 4 respectively such areas would be 162 163 5 1375 5 and 856 ha if the upper level decision makers decide to mainly reforest on grassland with the upper level policy maker s preference changing from reforesting on cropland to grassland the implementing levels of contour farming with conservation tillage would gradually increase on the contrary an opposite trend was observed for the implementing level of sloping pasture protection for instance if the upper level policy makers prefer to transform cropland to forest the areas of sloping pasture that need to be protected would be 528 829 5 3332 and 656 ha in zones 1 2 3 and 4 respectively such areas would be 528 829 5 3224 57 3332 and 471 43 600 ha if the upper level policy makers prefer to transform grassland to forest particularly the implementing levels of filtration strips construction in zone 1 would be 0 in the three scenarios which reveals that compared with the other two bmps filtration strips construction is not cost effective for nps mitigation in this zone moreover different Œ± cuts would not have significant influences on the implementing levels of contour farming with conservation tillage and sloping pasture protection it could merely affect the constructing lengths of filtration strips along the river in zone 2 for example when the upper level policy maker decides that the main reforested area should be contributed by cropland the constructing lengths of filtration strips along the river in zone 2 would be 174 57 1305 43 234 10 1374 87 and 293 62 1444 32 m when the Œ± cuts are 0 25 0 5 and 0 75 respectively those would be 376 45 1667 65 435 98 1747 10 and 495 5 1816 54 m when the upper level policy maker prefers that the main reforested area should be contributed by grassland such varying pattern can reflect that compared with the other three zones zone 2 is the most cost effective one for constructing filtration strips when the allowable total discharge amounts of nps pollutants are relatively low when the lower level decision makers have a strong propensity for water environmental protection i e making their decisions following scenario 3 the preference of upper level policy maker would have a similar influence of on the bmp implementing levels table 6 for example the areas of contour farming with conservation tillage would be increased from 123 93 143 126 53 146 165 53 191 and 866 67 1000 ha to 241 80 259 20 244 40 261 60 1829 53 2111 and 1329 47 1369 60 ha in the zones 1 2 3 and 4 respectively if the preference of upper level policy makers changes from reforesting on cropland to grassland also the areas of sloping pasture that need to be protected would be decreased from 1268 14 1327 20 4733 14 5331 20 and 891 1049 60 ha to 1161 29 1327 20 3224 57 4104 and 471 43 600 ha in the zones 2 3 and 4 respectively concurrently the influences of different Œ± cuts would be relatively greater in this scenario although different Œ± cuts would not significantly affect the implementing levels of contour farming with conservation tillage they would have significant influences on both the protection areas of sloping pasture in zone 1 and the constructing lengths of filtration strips along the river in zone 2 for instance when the upper level policy maker prefers to reforest on cropland the protection areas of sloping pasture in zone 1 would be 351 21 844 80 440 50 844 80 and 529 79 844 80 ha when the Œ± cuts are 0 25 0 5 and 0 75 respectively those would be 244 36 844 80 333 64 844 80 and 422 93 844 80 ha when the upper level policy maker prefers to reforest on grassland thus the implementing levels of these two bmps in zones 1 and 2 would increase with the increasing Œ± cut value this trend revealed that when the allowable total discharge amounts of nps pollutants decreased constructing filtration strips in the zone 2 and protecting the sloping pasture in the zone 1 would be first selected to mitigate the excessive discharge pollution loads which meant that the two bmps implemented in these two zones would be relatively more cost effective 4 3 net benefits of the entire system different land use patterns and bmp implementing levels under various scenarios would lead to varying net system benefits the net benefit of the entire system would be simultaneously affected by the upper and lower level decision makers preferences fig 4 specifically when the lower level decision makers follow scenario 2 the net system benefit would gradually decrease with the changes of upper level decision maker s preference from reforesting on cropland to grassland for example if the upper level decision makers follow scenario 1 the net system benefits would be 4 88 5 72 107 when the Œ± cuts are 0 25 that would be reduced to 4 75 5 68 107 if the upper level decision makers follow scenario 3 at the same time different Œ± cuts would also have influence on the net system benefit with the increase of Œ± cut the net system benefit would show a decreasing trend for instance it would reduce from 4 86 5 72 to 4 80 5 65 107 when the Œ± cut increases from 0 25 to 0 75 if the upper level decision makers think the reforesting area should be equally contributed by cropland and grassland concurrently when the lower level decision makers follow scenario 3 the influence of different Œ± cuts on the net system benefits would be similar for each scenario the net system benefit would decrease with the increase of Œ± cut such variations of net system benefit with different Œ± cuts can reflect that when the allowable discharge amounts of nps pollutants are reduced more bmps should be conducted to mitigate the excess nps pollution leading to the decrease in net system benefits at the same time the influence of different land use adjustment patterns i e different upper level decision scenarios would be different specifically the upper bound of the net system benefits would slightly increase with the changes of upper level decision maker s preference from reforesting on cropland to grassland however the lower bound of the net system benefits would show a trend of first increasing and then decreasing for example the net system benefits would be 4 98 5 756 4 99 5 760 and 4 95 5 764 107 for the three upper level decision scenarios when the Œ± cut is 0 25 compared with the net system benefit when the lower level decision makers following scenario 2 it would be higher if the lower decision makers follow this scenario thus the net benefit of the entire system is the consequence of joint influences of the upper and lower level decision makers in general the preferences of the lower level decision makers would have more significant influence a stronger propensity of the lower level decision makers to protect water environment would lead to a higher net system benefit 4 4 implementing costs of each subarea the bmp implementing cost of zone 3 would be highest in the four zones while that of zone 1 would be the lowest the bmp implementing costs of different zones would show different variation trends when the upper and lower level decision makers follow different scenarios fig 5 specifically when the lower level decision makers follow scenario 2 the implementing costs of zones 1 2 and 4 would show an increasing trend when the reforesting area on cropland decreases i e the upper level decision maker s preference changes from scenario 1 to 3 for example if the upper level policy makers prefer to transform cropland to forest the total costs of the bmp implementation in the zones 1 2 and 4 would be 1 26 1 81 2 67 11 44 and 6 07 15 31 105 respectively when the Œ± cut is 0 25 the costs would gradually increase to 1 37 1 88 3 78 14 05 and 9 91 21 52 105 when the upper level policy makers change their preference to reforest on grassland however the implementing cost of zone 3 would show a first decreasing and then increasing trend with the change of the upper level decision maker s preference for instance when the Œ± cut is 0 50 the total implementing cost would decrease from 1 78 3 998 106 to 1 76 3 994 106 and then increase to 2 12 4 84 106 when the preference of upper level policy maker changes from scenario 1 to scenarios 2 and 3 at the same time different Œ± cuts would significantly affect the total implementing cost of each zone with the increase of Œ± cut both the upper and lower bounds of the costs would show an increasing trend taking zone 4 as an example if the upper and lower level decision makers follow scenarios 1 and 2 respectively the total implementing costs would be increased from 6 07 15 31 105 to 6 16 15 49 and 6 26 15 66 105 when the Œ± cut increases from 0 25 to 0 5 and 0 75 such variation trends indicate that the lower level decision makers need to pay more for the water protection with the improvement of the surrounding water environment requirement when the lower level decision makers follow scenario 3 there would be some difference for the implementing costs of the four zones fig 5 to be specific for the zones 1 and 4 the similar increasing trends would be observed for the implementing cost when the reforesting area of cropland decreases however for the zones 2 and 3 the variation trends would be changed in terms of the implementing cost of zone 2 it would show a first decreasing and then increasing trend that of zone 3 would show an increasing trend similarly both the upper and lower bounds of the total costs in the four zones would show an increasing trend with the increase of Œ± cut through comparing the total costs of the four zones under different lower level decision scenarios it can be found that except for the zone 1 the total costs of the zones 2 3 and 4 would be much lower when the lower level decision makers have strong propensity for water environment protection thus a wide range of allowable bmp implementing levels provided by the lower level decision makers would not necessarily lead to a high cost because different bmps might not be equally cost effective and the total cost of each zone mainly depends on the implementing levels of multiple bmps the increase of the high cost effective bmp implementing level might result in a decrease in the total cost in this research when the propensity of the lower level decision makers to protect the water environment becomes stronger i e following scenario 3 to provide a wider range of allowable bmp implementing levels the implementing levels of contour farming with conservation tillage in the four zones would increase and those of sloping pasture protection in zones 2 3 and 4 would also increase conversely the implementing levels of filtration strips construction in zones 2 3 and 4 would decrease such variations indicate that contour farming with conservation tillage and sloping pasture protection would be more cost effective than filtration strips construction for the zone 1 the upper bound of the cost would be much higher and the lower bound would be a little lower such different variation trend mainly due to the special bmp implementing scheme i e no filtration strips would be constructed in this area only the area of sloping pasture protection changed with the lower level decision maker s preference however it can also indicate that contour farming with conservation tillage and sloping pasture protection would be more cost effective than filtration strips construction because the model results show the former two types of bmps would be first selected when the allowable discharge amounts of nps pollutants are limited 5 conclusion agricultural nonpoint source nps pollution has become the primary cause leading to water environmental deterioration due to the multiple uncertainties and complexities in the system it is quite important to develop an advanced integrated management model for supporting agricultural nps pollution control in this research an export coefficient based inexact fuzzy bi level multi objective programming ec ifblmop model was developed through integrating export coefficient model ecm interval parameter programming ipp and fuzzy parameter programming fpp within a bi level multi objective programming framework the model has the following advantages and improvements a uncertainties expressed as discrete intervals and fuzzy membership functions can be effectively addressed through coupling the ipp and fpp methods b system inherent structure can be reflected through introducing a bi level model framework c the cooperation and gaming relationship of the decision makers at different levels can be fully considered and d bi level multi objective problem in the agricultural system can be solved the proposed model was then applied to a real world case study in the upper stream watershed of the miyun reservoir in north china to demonstrate its potential applicability the results of the case study showed that land use patterns and bmp implementing levels would be significantly optimized to achieve a balance between the objectives of the upper and lower level decision makers when the allowable discharge amounts of nps pollutants were limited also results corresponding to different decision scenarios could provide the upper and lower level decision makers with a set of decision alternatives to help identify the most appropriate management strategy the model has a good applicability and can be effectively utilized for agricultural nps pollution management the proposed ec ifblmop model is an attempt to handle the multiple complexities and uncertainties in agricultural systems although the two level structure of the system was considered it is still unable to fully reflect the structure of a real case system also the model has some limitations to deal with the uncertainties expressed as probability density function thus in the future research stochastic mathematical programming methods will be introduced to the bi level or even multi level optimization framework to better reflect the uncertainties and complexities in real world cases acknowledgements this work was financially supported by the national

7521,climate indices characterize climate systems and may identify important indicators for long term precipitation which are driven by climate interactions in atmosphere ocean circulation in this study we investigated the climate indices that are effective indicators of long term precipitation in south korea and examined their relationships based on statistical methods monthly total precipitation was collected from a total of 60 meteorological stations and they were decomposed by ensemble empirical mode decomposition eemd to identify the inherent oscillating patterns or cycles cross correlation analysis and stepwise variable selection were employed to select the significant climate indices at each station the climate indices that affect the monthly precipitation in south

of monthly precipitation in south korea moreover they indicate meaningful physical information e g periodic oscillations and long term trend inherent in the monthly precipitation the nino12 indices with four and ten month lags was a strong indicator representing periodic oscillations in monthly precipitation in addition the long term trend of the monthly precipitation could be explained by the amo index a multiple linear regression model was constructed to investigate the influences of the identified climate indices on the prediction of monthly precipitation three identified climate indices successfully explained the monthly precipitation in the winter dry season compared to the monthly precipitation in coastal areas the monthly precipitation in inland areas showed stronger correlation

regression 1 introduction precipitation is a major hydroclimatic variable and a representative phenomenon of complex climate systems long term precipitation measured on a monthly basis plays an important role in understanding the global hydrological cycle and long term water resources management thus it provides fundamental information for designing infrastructure and water management systems shuttleworth 2012 climate interactions e g atmosphere ocean circulation are closely associated with long term precipitation and climate indices are widely used for indicating the climate variability as a simple diagnostic quantity in order to characterize an aspect of a geophysical system ncar 2015 therefore climate indices which combine information relevant to the ocean and atmosphere may give critical information about long term precipitation many studies have attempted to examine the significant relationships between hydroclimatic variables and climate indices barnston 1994 colman and davey 1999 araghinejad et al 2006 brandimarte et al 2011 schepen et al 2012 deo and ≈üahin 2015 in particular they focused on the influence of the el nino southern oscillation enso phenomenon onto hydroclimatic variables lloyd hughes and saunders 2002 beebee and manga 2004 singhrattna et al 2005 power et al 2006 chandimala and zubair 2007 cai et al 2012 zhou and tung 2013 yoon and lee 2016 cai et al 2001 explored fluctuations of the enso australian rainfall relationship they analyzed this relationship by creating illustrations of correlation coefficients and examined multiple anomalous circulation features in the reversal period which provided a global context kirono et al 2010 used 12 atmosphere ocean predictors which were highly correlated to runoff and rainfall to determine relationships between these variables for australia they found a number of global climate indices for deriving the relationships of local precipitation patterns mekanik et al 2013 applied multiple regression analysis and artificial neural networks to forecast long term spring rainfall in australia using lagged enso and indian ocean dipole iod as potential indicators signal analyses e g fourier transform and wavelet transform analyses have been frequently employed to extract meaningful information on hydroclimatic variables that can represent a variety of physical mechanisms in the field wang and ding 2003 ancil and coulibaly 2004 rivera et al 2012 he et al 2014 empirical mode decomposition emd empirically developed by huang et al 1998 has been used in recent studies this method can extract intrinsic mode functions imfs that are simple oscillatory modes from a given time series a finite number of decomposed components as hidden signals within original data series can be found by emd wu and huang 2004 huang and wu 2008 it has the advantage of being a totally adaptive and data driven approach without the need for a priori basis function in contrast to other methods maheshwari and kumar 2014 singh et al 2017 wu et al 2007 demonstrated that physically meaningful signals and various trends e g linear overall adaptive and multidecadal trend in the oscillating original data can be extracted by emd they also reported that these components are pure oscillatory modes which bear an amplitude and a frequency modulation lee and ouarda 2010 predicted long term oscillation patterns in climate indices for future evolutions of precipitation and extreme hydrological variables using a nonstationary oscillation process modeling with the emd process to improve the drawbacks of emd caused by the mode mixing problem wu and huang 2009 proposed ensemble empirical mode decomposition eemd recently many studies in the hydroclimatic field have adopted eemd because of the advantages offered by the decomposition properties lee and ouarda 2011 2012 lee et al 2013 kim and cho 2016 some studies have been conducted to investigate the relationships between hydroclimatic variables and climate indices in south korea jin et al 2005 revealed a correlation between the southern oscillation index soi and monthly precipitation at five meteorological stations in south korea it was found that monthly precipitation in south korea is influenced by la nina events with lag times of four months for southern coastal areas and five months for central and northern areas however they only used the soi index to reflect the impact of the enso phenomenon kim et al 2007 performed seasonal prediction of monthly precipitation and temperature using 18 climate indices to overcome the limitation of only using enso related indices they investigated the predictors that are related to the target month of october for 12 korean weather stations and the range of correlation coefficients was 0 35 0 63 for precipitation in their conclusion a physical understanding of the climate system remained as an open question lee and julien 2016 identified a relationship between the enso index and monthly precipitation patterns in south korea based on composite and harmonic analyses they concluded that the teleconnections between the tropical southern oscillation phenomenon and precipitation over south korea have a lag time of four seasons on the other hand ho et al 2016 argued that the effect of enso on seasonal precipitation does not appear to be systematic they concluded that the seasonal precipitation variability in south korea cannot be explained in terms of enso activities and that the major factors in modulating the seasonal precipitation in south korea remain unknown they also stated the necessity of long range precipitation forecasts as compared to short term forecasts due to the chaotic nature of the climate system although previous studies attempted to identify the relationships between climate indices and long term precipitation in south korea these studies did not take into account the inherent cycles in the long term precipitation to enhance our understanding of the behavior of long term precipitation in south korea there is a need to consider the inherent cycles in investigating the relationship between climate indices and long term precipitation in south korea therefore the hidden components within the long term precipitation were identified by eemd and various climate indices were used in the present study subsequently the relationships between the hidden components and climate indices were examined the objectives of this study were to 1 identify the climate indices which can be indicators of a long term trend and periodic oscillations that affect the long term precipitation using data from 60 meteorological stations in south korea via statistical methods such as eemd cross correlation analysis and stepwise variable selection and 2 investigate the statistical relationship between the identified climate indices and monthly precipitation by multiple linear regression analysis correlation coefficients corr and root mean square errors rmse were used to measure the performances of the multiple linear regression models and standardized correlation coefficients were employed to examine the relative importance of the identified climate indices on prediction of monthly precipitation the rest of this paper is organized as follows section 2 describes the methodology of the statistical methods used in this study namely eemd cross correlation analysis stepwise variable selection multiple linear regression model section 3 presents the study area and data set for this study such as monthly total precipitation in south korea and climate indices section 4 presents the results and discussions of the current study finally section 5 presents our conclusions 2 methodology to identify the climate indices that affect long term precipitation in south korea several statistical analyses were carried out and the procedure to identify the climate indices is illustrated in fig 1 eemd was applied to extract the inherent oscillatory components namely the imfs in the monthly total precipitation cross correlation analysis was conducted to find correlations between the decomposed components and 25 global climate indices considering time lags up to 12 months the three most highly correlated top3 climate indices were selected for the decomposed components in other words each decomposed component had the top 3 climate indices stepwise variable selection was performed based on multiple regressions to find the significant climate indices among those selected from cross correlation analysis the climate indices that affect the long term precipitation were identified based on selection frequencies from the results of stepwise variable selection finally multiple linear regression analysis was carried out to investigate the influences of the identified climate indices on the prediction of monthly precipitation the detailed methodologies and theoretical background of the used methods are described in the following subsections 2 1 ensemble empirical mode decomposition eemd emd decomposes nonlinear and nonstationary data series for extracting a finite number of decomposed components termed as imfs each imf shows an oscillatory pattern which may represent physically meaningful information hidden in the original data series the imfs should satisfy two conditions 1 the number of extrema and zero crossings must either be equal to each other or differ at most by one in the whole data series and 2 the mean value of the upper envelope defined by connecting all the local maxima and the lower envelope defined by connecting all the local minima should be zero at any point huang et al 1998 emd is performed by an iterative process called a sifting algorithm as follows 1 find the upper and lower envelopes by connecting the local maxima x u t and local minima x l t using the cubic spline method for a given time series x t t 1 2 3 t t is data length 2 calculate the mean value between the local maxima and local minima that is x mean t x u t x l t 2 3 obtain h t by extracting the x mean t from the original time series x t that is h t x t x mean t 4 check whether h t satisfies the two conditions of imfs or not if h t is an imf h t is the first imf of the given time series else treat x t as h t and iterate steps 1 to 3 until h t satisfies the two conditions of imfs 5 define a new time series n t by extracting imf t from the original time series x t that is n t x t imf t and the original time series x t is replaced by n t 6 repeat steps 1 to 5 until no more imfs can be extracted and the last imf becomes the residue r t 7 finally the original time series x t can be written as eq 1 1 x t i 1 m imf i t r t where m is the number of imfs emd suffers the drawbacks caused by the appearance of mode mixing which is a specific signal retained in different imf components to ameliorate the drawbacks caused by the mode mixing problem wu and huang 2009 proposed eemd eemd is a noise assisted analysis method that sifts data with an added ensemble of white noise signals and treats the mean as the final result wu and huang 2009 a white noise signal is added to a given time series and it is decomposed by the sifting algorithm as described above different white noise signals are added to each repetition the ensemble means of the decomposed components can be obtained as the final result this additional step improves the results over the emd process by eliminating the chance of mode mixing and extracting improved physical meaning from the decomposed components lei et al 2009 zhang et al 2010 2 2 cross correlation analysis cross correlation analysis is a signal processing method that measures the similarity between two different time series considering a range of time lags the cross correlation coefficient r k demonstrates the strength of a linear relationship between the two time series which has a range from 1 0 to 1 0 if the value of r k is close to 1 0 or 1 0 there is a strong negative or positive relationship between the two time series respectively the correlation coefficient between the two time series x 1 and x 2 with a time lag k is defined by eq 2 box et al 1994 2 r k t 1 t k x 1 t x 1 t x 2 t k x 2 t t 1 t x 1 t x 1 t 2 t 1 t x 2 t x 2 t 2 where x 1 t and x 2 t are the sample means for each series k is allowed to be either positive or negative 2 3 stepwise variable selection stepwise variable selection is a method of selecting variables to build a regression model by adding or subtracting a variable from the set of explanatory variables draper and smith 1998 it can provide statistically significant variables for a regression model there are three main approaches for stepwise variable selection forward selection backward elimination and bidirectional elimination forward selection starts with no variables a null model and adds the variable that gives the most statistically significant improvement to the model fit backward elimination starts with all the predictive variables a full model and removes the variable that gives the most statistically insignificant reduction in the model fit bidirectional elimination is a combination of these two methods in that it uses a forward selection procedure with the possibility of removing a selected variable at each stage through backward elimination in the present study the bidirectional elimination method was used to determine a regression model since it takes advantage offered by both forward selection and backward elimination wang et al 2016 for implementing the bidirectional elimination we used the leaps package in r software lumley 2017 2 4 multiple linear regression model multiple linear regression is used to explain the relationship between a response variable and a number of explanatory variables the general form of a multiple linear regression model is the following equation with a response variable predicted data y t and explanatory variables x p t 3 y t Œ≤ 0 p 1 n Œ≤ p x p t Œµ where n is the number of explanatory variables Œ≤ 0 is a constant term intercept Œ≤ p are the regression coefficients for explanatory variables and Œµ is a noise term the method of least squares estimation is used to estimate parameters corr and rmse are used to measure the performance of the multiple linear regression models corr is obtained by eq 2 when the k 0 rmse represents the magnitudes of the errors in prediction between the two time series as defined by eq 4 4 rmse 1 t t 1 t y t x t 2 where y t and x t are the predicted and observed monthly precipitation in the context of analyzing the multiple linear regression model application of standardized regression coefficients allows us to measure the relative importance of the explanatory nathans et al 2012 since the coefficients of the multiple linear regression model are standardized to have zero mean and standard deviation as one the importance of explanatory variables can be compared to each other without considering their scales as a result an explanatory variable with larger absolute standardized regression coefficient has a greater influence on a response variable than other variables with smaller absolute standardized regression coefficients 3 data and study region 3 1 monthly total precipitation in south korea south korea is located in northeast asia and has a geographical characteristic that the three sides east west and south are surrounded by the sea korean meteorological administration kma operates the meteorological stations and controls the quality of data in south korea in this study we used monthly total precipitation from a total of 60 meteorological stations of the kma with more than 40 years records geographical locations of the meteorological stations are presented in fig 2 and the information of the stations is given in table 1 long term precipitation measured on a monthly basis in south korea demonstrates cyclic patterns including climatic characteristics for example heavy rainfall concentrated in the summer rainy season to summarize the seasonal variation in monthly precipitation for all stations a box and whisker plot was illustrated in fig 3 there was an apparent seasonal variation in the monthly precipitation the largest amount of precipitation including extremes occurred in the summer rainy season june to september a relatively small amount of precipitation was also recorded in the spring and autumn seasons april may october and november the lowest amount of precipitation was recorded in the winter dry season december to march 3 2 climate indices monthly atmosphere and ocean time series each climate index is a quantity used to characterize one aspect of the geophysical system ncar 2015 there are many climate indices to measure and monitor the geophysical system as any one climate index cannot measure the entire geophysical system perfectly to characterize aspects of the specific climate modes different climate indices were derived by different measurements from the original monthly records in this study a total of 25 climate indices were employed to determine the most statistically related indices as predictors for monthly precipitation in south korea the climate indices were grouped into four types sea surface temperature multiple index atmospheric circulation and others to represent the influence on atmospheric and oceanic circulation patterns based on the climatic modes table 2 shows a list and brief description of the climate indices used in this study 4 results and discussion 4 1 decomposition results in this study the monthly precipitation was decomposed into a finite number of decomposed components with added white noise with an amplitude of 0 2 times the standard deviation of the original data and the ensemble size set to 250 since the total number of imfs of a data series is roughly close to log 2 t where t is the data length a total of seven or eight imfs were extracted from each meteorological station wu et al 2007 fig 4 shows an example of the decomposed components by eemd at mungyeong station no 273 located near the center of south korea as the decomposition proceeded upper order imfs showed a lower frequency level and vice versa the residue has a monotonic function representing the long term trend of the monthly precipitation the decomposed components have mean periods obtained by dividing the total number of data by the number of extrema fig 5 presents the box and whisker plots of the mean periods of the decomposed components for all stations the mean periods represent different levels of climatic variability from interannual to multidecadal time scales and their ranges become widely dispersed depending on the order the imf1 to imf3 contained about 3 6 12 month cycles respectively that indicate the presence of seasonality the imf4 to imf6 represented cycles that correspond to approximately 2 6 years the imf7 and imf8 indicated the cycles were longer than a 10 year timescale oscillation 4 2 cross correlation analysis between climate indices and decomposed components cross correlation analysis considering time lags from 0 to 12 months were conducted between the decomposed components of the monthly precipitation series and twenty five climate indices if a climate index had different time lags it was treated as an independent climate index therefore a total of 325 13 time lags 25 climate indices cross correlation coefficients r k were calculated for each station and the top3 climate indices corresponding to the decomposed components were selected based on the absolute value of r k table 3 presents the top 3 climate indices for the decomposed components based on the value of r k at mungyeong station no 273 high values of r k are detected in the imf3 and residue the nino12 index 4 month lag r k 0 81 in the imf3 provides the highest value of r k the top 3 indices at the imf3 are mainly related to enso indices the globalt index no lag r k 0 80 in the residue provides the second highest r k of the top 3 climate indices and the amo index no lag r k 0 70 provides the third highest value of r k 4 3 multiple linear regression analysis 4 3 1 identification of the climate indices that affect long term precipitation in south korea the stepwise variable selection method was performed using the climate indices leading to three highest linear correlations for each decomposed component and station in the results of cross correlation analysis in this study we used a bidirectional elimination approach with aic criteria significant climate indices were selected for each station the number of selected variables ranged from three to eleven averaging at seven table 4 shows the most frequently selected climate indices up to the third rank in column order for the decomposed components and their mean values of r k the climate indices with relatively high value of r k appear in the imf2 imf3 and residue the climate indices selected in the imf2 and imf3 are all classified as enso sst pacific which is the enso related indices among these nino indices the nino12 index shows a higher correlation coefficient than the other nino indices such as nino34 and nino3 on the other hand the climate indices selected in the residue are mainly classified as sst atlantic the climate indices that affect the long term precipitation in south korea were identified based on the selection frequencies of the selected climate indices from the results of stepwise variable selection for all stations table 5 presents a list of the identified climate indices and their selection frequencies the climate index with the highest value of r k is nino12 with a 4 month lag and it is selected as a significant index for 43 out of a total of 60 stations 71 67 the climate index with second highest value of r k was nino12 with a 10 month lag and it is selected for 39 stations 65 therefore the nino12 index was finally selected as a significant indicator with the highest correlation coefficient and the highest selection frequencies across south korea in addition the climate index with the third highest value of r k was the amo no lag index which mostly demonstrates significance at the imf7 imf8 or residue that have cycles longer than a decade oscillations consequently the nino12 4 month lag index is the primary climate index for monthly precipitation the past patterns of nino12 indices give important predictive information for periodic oscillations of monthly precipitation the behavior of amo index also provides information for the long term trend of monthly precipitation to examine the relationships between the identified climate indices and decomposed components imf2 imf3 and the residue of mungyoung station no 273 and their identified climate indices are plotted as an example in fig 6 the y axes on the left hand side are the scales for imf2 imf3 and residue and those on the right hand side are the scales of the three identified climate indices note that the imf2 and nino12 4 month lag index have similar fluctuation in their oscillatory patterns in fig 6 a although there are slight differences in amplitude and frequency we confirm that there is a positive correlation between the imf2 and nino12 4 month lag index the imf3 and nino12 10 month lag index show a completely opposite fluctuation in their oscillatory patterns as in fig 6 b there is a strong negative correlation between the imf3 and nino12 10 month lag index in fig 6 c the residue which represents the long term trend appears to be a slightly upward nonlinear trend over the entire period and its behavior is similar to the general tendency of amo no lag index notably the detection of the nino12 4 and 10 month lag indices supported the results of previous studies based on the statistically significant correlations between the precipitation patterns in south korea and the enso cycle jin et al 2005 suggested that the stronger the la nina event the less precipitation there is to be expected four or five months later lee and julien 2016 found that the stronger intensity of the el nino la nina forcing the larger smaller the precipitation overall in south korea with a lag time of four seasons furthermore we found detailed information about the predictive time lags of climate indices with six month intervals since the imf2 and imf3 have seasonality with the mean periods of 6 and 12 months respectively we confirmed that the nino12 4 and 10 month lags indices can explain the periodic oscillations in the monthly precipitation series it means that the seasonality of long term precipitation in south korea is the most consistent with the nino12 index which tends to have the largest variance than other nino indices trenberth 2016 previous studies have demonstrated that the amo index which indicates long time scale oceanic phenomena in the north atlantic ocean has influenced hydroclimatic variables for many regions of the continent enfield et al 2001 mccabe et al 2004 sutton and hodson 2005 zhang and delworth 2006 for the northeast asia region a physical mechanism was identified for the teleconnections for the asian summer monsoon that influence the climate of south korea a warm amo phase is associated with a large scale positive tropospheric temperature anomaly over eurasia therefore it increases the meridional gradient of tropospheric temperature delays monsoon withdrawal and enhances monsoon rainfall goswami et al 2006 li and bates 2007 found the physical mechanism that winters in east china tend to be warmer and wetter than normal in the wide northern area when the warm amo phase occurs by inducing negative surface air pressure anomalies in the hemispheric wide domain extending from the midlatitude north atlantic to midlatitude eurasia they suggested that the influence is physically reasonable and realistic interactions within large scale atmospheric circulation wang et al 2011 provided that the amo is possibly related to hydroclimatic variables in east asia by presenting a new tree ring reconstruction although it is a feature of the sea surface temperature in the north atlantic ocean basin in addition to these results based on physical mechanisms we found a significant positive correlation between the amo index and monthly precipitation in the long term phase therefore it was evident that the behavior of the amo index indicates a long term trend in monthly precipitation series of south korea located in northeast asia 4 3 2 investigation statistical relationship using a multiple linear regression model to understand the relationships between the identified climate indices and monthly precipitation and to assess the predictability of the identified climate indices in south korea multiple linear regression was conducted for all stations the calibration period was set until 2014 and the validation period was set to the two most recent years 2015 2016 the three identified climate indices in table 5 were used to predict the monthly precipitation as explanatory variables the multiple linear regression model used in this study is defined by eq 5 5 y t Œ≤ 0 Œ≤ 1 x 1 t k 1 Œ≤ 2 x 2 t k 2 Œ≤ 3 x 3 t k 3 where x 1 x 2 x 3 are the nino12 k 1 4 nino12 k 2 10 amo k 3 0 respectively t is time and k i is the time lag the regression coefficients Œ≤ 0 Œ≤ 1 Œ≤ 2 and Œ≤ 3 are determined by a least squares method in the calibration the corr of the 60 stations range from 0 281 to 0 673 with a mean of 0 601 mungyeong station no 273 records the highest corr among the regression models in the validation the corr range from 0 230 to 0 613 with a mean of 0 469 at the mungyeong station no 273 the corr of the validation period was 0 4685 very similar to the mean value fig 7 presents the observed precipitation and estimated precipitation by the multiple linear regression model at mungyeong station no 273 in the calibration period it is observed that monthly precipitation estimates from the regression model adequately reproduce the oscillatory patterns of observed monthly precipitation however underestimation is shown in predicting precipitation in the summer rainy season particularly for the large peaks this result was consistently observed at all employed stations in the validation period the predicted precipitation is overestimated in 2015 and underestimated in 2016 while maintaining the oscillation patterns the reason for the overestimation in 2015 is the occurrence of severe drought in the central region of south korea the precipitation characteristics in 2015 showed extreme weather conditions in that the amount of precipitation was only 35 that of a normal year high pressure in the northeast region caused severe drought in the central region and heavy precipitation in the south region of south korea the general pattern was restored in 2016 although the performance in the validation period was worse than in the calibration period due to these precipitation characteristics the overfitting problem did not occur in the multiple linear regression model because there was not a large discrepancy between the calibration and validation periods these critical behaviors of the regression models are consistent with those in other stations not shown here to evaluate the performance of the regression models the rmse of the calibration and validation periods for each month and all stations are presented in fig 8 in the calibration period the median rmses for each month are highest in the summer rainy season jun to sep with large variation and lowest in the winter dry season dec to mar with small variation in the validation period the median rmses for each month are equal to or smaller than in calibration period and the variation in rmse is much larger than in the calibration period due to the extreme weather conditions that occurred in 2015 throughout south korea although the performance by corr in the validation period was worse than in the calibration period median rmses for each month in the validation period are equal to or smaller than those in calibration period in addition the multiple linear regression models show better predictability in the winter dry season for both two periods the results indicate that the identified climate indices consistently provide a better understanding of monthly precipitation in the winter dry season than the summer rainy season by the multiple linear regression model this is due to the precipitation characteristics of south korea in which temporal and spatial variability of precipitation is very high seo et al 2015 heavy precipitation more than 70 of annual precipitation concentrates in the summer rainy season and predicting precipitation in the summer rainy season is more difficult than the east asian summer monsoon due to a variety of air masses such as tropical monsoon air cold dry air from the continent of asia north pacific subtropical high air cold moist air over the okhotsk sea and polar air that are not represented explicitly seo et al 2011 seo et al 2015 kim et al 2017 in addition the large peaks in summer precipitation in south korea are mainly driven by typhoons predicting the effects of typhoons on monthly precipitation is very difficult because of the complexities of typhoon influences such as pathway intensity and life span in addition the amount of precipitation by typhoons varies greatly depending on the rate of movement development conditions and the terrain it passes through the complex natural phenomena in precipitation characteristics of the summer rainy season make a limitation in precipitation prediction by the multiple linear regression model because it has to be parameterized by physical processes such as the occurrence of extreme precipitation and it is difficult to detect by large scale atmosphere ocean circulation patterns on the other hand the winter dry season shows more stable predictability than the summer rainy season due to lower variation additionally the multiple linear regression models were separately constructed with the identified climate indices for the summer rainy season jun jul aug sep jjas and the winter dry season nov dec jan feb ndjf at mungyeong station no 273 to compare the effects of identified climate indices on seasonal and long term precipitation the result showed that the ndjf season has a lower rmse 24 06 than the jjas season 125 06 because the amount of precipitation is small and the variability of the precipitation is also small however the corr in jjas and ndjf seasons 0 385 and 0 338 respectively are similar and both are lower than the original long term precipitation all monthly data this is because the identified climate indices were selected by considering climate variability in the long term precipitation data more than 40 years thus the identified climate indices are suited for predicting monthly precipitation rather than predicting specific seasons therefore this result shows that the identified climate indices related to the periodic oscillations and a long term trend can provide better predictive information for long term prediction than for predicting specific seasons maps of corr in the calibration and validation periods of the multiple linear regression models are shown in fig 9 for investigating spatial patterns kriging interpolation technique was applied to describe spatial distributions of corr in the calibration period the corr is highest in the central area and lowest in the northeast area fig 9 a this means that the performance of multiple linear regression models in inland areas is better than in coastal areas in the validation period the corr is higher in the slightly upper and lower inland areas then the coastal area especially the southeastern area fig 9 b although the corr values in the validation period are smaller than those in the calibration period the spatial distributions of corr values for the two periods seem similar except for the south area where heavy precipitation caused by extreme weather conditions occurred in the southeastern area in 2015 this can be explained by the geographical characteristics of south korea south korea is a relatively small region in which to consider the similar impacts of global climate indices however the three sides surrounding by the sea and mountainous terrain make a large variability in monthly precipitation the coastal areas are particularly vulnerable to the impact of tropical cyclones such as clouds convection and typhoons the primary energy source for these storms is warm ocean water therefore these storms are typically stronger when over or near water and weaken quite rapidly when over land in addition the effect of typhoons on south korea is very strong as described above especially the typhoons in the summer rainy season of south korea that mainly pass between the east sea and japan therefore the east coastal area in south korea is significantly affected by typhoons and has a large variability in monthly precipitation this suggests that the multiple linear regression model has a limitation in adequately representing the geographical climate characteristics in coastal areas such as moisture convection topography and typhoons these geographical climate characteristics are essential to make accurate precipitation predictions however it is difficult to consider the geographical characteristics because the identified climate indices represent large scale atmospheric ocean circulation patterns on the other hand the geographical characteristics in inland areas are relatively stable as compared to in coastal or island areas consequently the multiple linear regression model with the identified climate indices provided better performance in predicting monthly precipitation in inland areas than in coastal or island areas in both two periods to investigate the relative importance of the identified climate indices in monthly precipitation prediction the standardized regression coefficients are spatially described in fig 10 the nino12 4 month lag index shows the positive standardized regression coefficients for all stations as shown in fig 10 a overall absolute values of the standardized regression coefficients range from 0 4 to 0 6 the nino12 4 month lag index is the most important variable to predict the monthly precipitation in the multiple regression models the nino12 10 month lag index shows the negative standardized regression coefficients in a range of 0 4 to 0 2 for the most stations as shown in fig 10 b nino12 10 month lag index is the second most important variable in the multiple regression models these results support that these two indices nino12 with 4 10 month lags have large influences on the multiple linear regression models as explanatory variables the amo index has the lowest standardized regression coefficients in the range of 0 2 to 0 2 as shown in fig 10 c it has relatively lesser influence on the monthly precipitation prediction than the two indices described above particularly in the southern coastal areas the relative importance of the amo index is not significant overall spatial results of the standardized regression coefficients are similar with the results of the corr presented in fig 9 finally p values of the identified climate indices used in multiple linear regression models for all stations are illustrated to validate their statistical significance in fig 11 the p values of nino12 4 and 10 month lags indices are statistically significant at 5 significant level in all stations as shown in fig 11 a and b it is confirmed that the use of the nino12 4 and 10 month lags indices is essential to predict oscillatory patterns of monthly precipitation as evident by their significance at all stations on the other hand the p values of the regression coefficients for the amo index are not significant for all stations unlike the results of nino12 the p values of the regression coefficients are presented in fig 11 c the coefficients of the amo index are statistically significant in most of the central and northern inland areas at 5 significant level while the coefficients of the amo index in southeast of the coastal areas are insignificant the importance of amo index is lower than the nino12 4 and 10 month lags indices in the islands and coastal areas additionally the amo index can explain long term trend in the monthly precipitation of inland areas from the results it may be inferred that the long term trend of monthly precipitation in south korea are disturbed by the typhoons since occurrences and magnitudes of the typhoons may not show long term trend the prediction of monthly precipitation in coastal areas may be disturbed by the typhoons 5 conclusions in this study we identified the climate indices that are effective indicators for monthly precipitation in south korea by using linear relationships between the climate indices and long term precipitation for this purpose statistical methods such as eemd cross correlation analysis and stepwise variable selection were applied the multiple linear regression model was constructed to assess predictability with the three identified climate indices nino12 indices with four and ten month lags and amo index with no lag as explanatory variables and the relationships between monthly precipitation and identified climate indices were examined although the multiple linear regression model can only express linear relationships it was confirmed that the identified climate indices can interpret well the periodic oscillations and the long term trend in monthly precipitation therefore the prediction of long term precipitation using the identified climate indices makes it possible to understand intuitively the periodicity and trend that represent long term precipitation in south korea from the results of this study we drew several conclusions as follows 1 a finite number of decomposed components were found in monthly precipitation using eemd it was possible to identify periodic oscillations and long term trend in monthly precipitation through the cycles inherent in the decomposed components the climate indices with relatively high values of correlation coefficients r k mainly appeared in the imf2 imf3 and residue 2 more detailed information about the predictive time lags of climate indices was found depending on the nature of the decomposed components the nino12 index generally predicted the monthly precipitation that emerged four months later and again six months after that time these findings possibly support the detection of seasonality showing the positive and negative correlations in imf2 and imf3 which have 6 and 12 month cycles respectively based on a strong positive correlation between the amo index and residue we found that the amo index also affects the long term trend of monthly precipitation in south korea located in northeast asia 3 the identified climate indices in multiple linear regression models played the role of explanatory variables although the fitted model underestimated the large peaks in the rainy season we found that the identified climate indices were suitable for predicting the overall oscillatory patterns of the monthly precipitation and long term trend the corr in the center of inland area showed the highest values while the corr in island and the eastern coastal areas showed low values therefore it was confirmed that that the identified climate indices provide better information toward predicting monthly precipitation of the inland areas rather than that of the coastal or island areas 4 the nino12 4 month lag index showed the most influential index followed by the nino12 10 month lag index the coefficients of these two indices in multiple linear regression models were significant at 5 significance level for all stations the amo no lag index showed a relatively lower influence than these two indices our study may help to understand the inherent cycles of long term precipitation influenced by climate indices and to confirm the existence of periodic oscillations and long term trend for clarifying meaningful physical information with regard to long term precipitation precipitation prediction is necessary in south korea because streamflow is difficult to predict due to the presence of many hydraulic structures predicted precipitation can be used for long term water resources planning and management based on monthly precipitation such as dam and reservoir operation for hydropower and flood control water supply for agriculture industry domestic and integrated hydrological management for intake water water filtration drainage and water supply facilities this is very important because it directly affects water resource systems for the effective water resources system the decision should be determined and balanced based on quick and reliable predictions the multiple linear regression model used in this study has the advantage that it can predict monthly precipitation easily and quickly with the identified climate indices using fixed parameters for each station also it can provide more reliable precipitation estimates potentially taking into account large atmospheric ocean circulation patterns therefore the multiple linear regression model can be used for long term water resources management and planning in addition this study suggests the essential climate indices that should be preferentially considered as predictive indicators of a large atmospheric ocean circulation pattern to predict monthly precipitation in south korea however there is a limit to reveal the dynamical reason why the nino12 index is related to long term precipitation in south korea although there is a significant statistical relationship this dynamical reason should be deeply investigated in further study based on the atmospheric dynamics or physical phenomenon if so the statistical model will provide a consistent performance regardless of decades in addition to this further study is also needed to apply a model that focuses on predictability such as by using machine learning technology to overcome the limitations of the multiple linear regression model acknowledgement this research was supported by a grant 2017 mpss31 001 from supporting technology development program for disaster management funded by the ministry of the interior

7521,climate indices characterize climate systems and may identify important indicators for long term precipitation which are driven by climate interactions in atmosphere ocean circulation in this study we investigated the climate indices that are effective indicators of long term precipitation in south korea and examined their relationships based on statistical methods monthly total precipitation was collected from a total of 60 meteorological stations and they were decomposed by ensemble empirical mode decomposition eemd to identify the inherent oscillating patterns or cycles cross correlation analysis and stepwise variable selection were employed to select the significant climate indices at each station the climate indices that affect the monthly precipitation in south korea were identified based on the selection frequencies of the selected indices at all stations the nino12 indices with four and ten month lags and amo index with no lag were identified as indicators of monthly precipitation in south korea moreover they indicate meaningful physical information e g periodic oscillations and long term trend inherent in the monthly precipitation the nino12 indices with four and ten month lags was a strong indicator representing periodic oscillations in monthly precipitation in addition the long term trend of the monthly precipitation could be explained by the amo index a multiple linear regression model was constructed to investigate the influences of the identified climate indices on the prediction of monthly precipitation three identified climate indices successfully explained the monthly precipitation in the winter dry season compared to the monthly precipitation in coastal areas the monthly precipitation in inland areas showed stronger correlation to the identified climate indices keywords climate index ensemble empirical mode decomposition eemd monthly total precipitation nino1 2 nino12 atlantic multidecadal oscillation amo multiple linear regression 1 introduction precipitation is a major hydroclimatic variable and a representative phenomenon of complex climate systems long term precipitation measured on a monthly basis plays an important role in understanding the global hydrological cycle and long term water resources management thus it provides fundamental information for designing infrastructure and water management systems shuttleworth 2012 climate interactions e g atmosphere ocean circulation are closely associated with long term precipitation and climate indices are widely used for indicating the climate variability as a simple diagnostic quantity in order to characterize an aspect of a geophysical system ncar 2015 therefore climate indices which combine information relevant to the ocean and atmosphere may give critical information about long term precipitation many studies have attempted to examine the significant relationships between hydroclimatic variables and climate indices barnston 1994 colman and davey 1999 araghinejad et al 2006 brandimarte et al 2011 schepen et al 2012 deo and ≈üahin 2015 in particular they focused on the influence of the el nino southern oscillation enso phenomenon onto hydroclimatic variables lloyd hughes and saunders 2002 beebee and manga 2004 singhrattna et al 2005 power et al 2006 chandimala and zubair 2007 cai et al 2012 zhou and tung 2013 yoon and lee 2016 cai et al 2001 explored fluctuations of the enso australian rainfall relationship they analyzed this relationship by creating illustrations of correlation coefficients and examined multiple anomalous circulation features in the reversal period which provided a global context kirono et al 2010 used 12 atmosphere ocean predictors which were highly correlated to runoff and rainfall to determine relationships between these variables for australia they found a number of global climate indices for deriving the relationships of local precipitation patterns mekanik et al 2013 applied multiple regression analysis and artificial neural networks to forecast long term spring rainfall in australia using lagged enso and indian ocean dipole iod as potential indicators signal analyses e g fourier transform and wavelet transform analyses have been frequently employed to extract meaningful information on hydroclimatic variables that can represent a variety of physical mechanisms in the field wang and ding 2003 ancil and coulibaly 2004 rivera et al 2012 he et al 2014 empirical mode decomposition emd empirically developed by huang et al 1998 has been used in recent studies this method can extract intrinsic mode functions imfs that are simple oscillatory modes from a given time series a finite number of decomposed components as hidden signals within original data series can be found by emd wu and huang 2004 huang and wu 2008 it has the advantage of being a totally adaptive and data driven approach without the need for a priori basis function in contrast to other methods maheshwari and kumar 2014 singh et al 2017 wu et al 2007 demonstrated that physically meaningful signals and various trends e g linear overall adaptive and multidecadal trend in the oscillating original data can be extracted by emd they also reported that these components are pure oscillatory modes which bear an amplitude and a frequency modulation lee and ouarda 2010 predicted long term oscillation patterns in climate indices for future evolutions of precipitation and extreme hydrological variables using a nonstationary oscillation process modeling with the emd process to improve the drawbacks of emd caused by the mode mixing problem wu and huang 2009 proposed ensemble empirical mode decomposition eemd recently many studies in the hydroclimatic field have adopted eemd because of the advantages offered by the decomposition properties lee and ouarda 2011 2012 lee et al 2013 kim and cho 2016 some studies have been conducted to investigate the relationships between hydroclimatic variables and climate indices in south korea jin et al 2005 revealed a correlation between the southern oscillation index soi and monthly precipitation at five meteorological stations in south korea it was found that monthly precipitation in south korea is influenced by la nina events with lag times of four months for southern coastal areas and five months for central and northern areas however they only used the soi index to reflect the impact of the enso phenomenon kim et al 2007 performed seasonal prediction of monthly precipitation and temperature using 18 climate indices to overcome the limitation of only using enso related indices they investigated the predictors that are related to the target month of october for 12 korean weather stations and the range of correlation coefficients was 0 35 0 63 for precipitation in their conclusion a physical understanding of the climate system remained as an open question lee and julien 2016 identified a relationship between the enso index and monthly precipitation patterns in south korea based on composite and harmonic analyses they concluded that the teleconnections between the tropical southern oscillation phenomenon and precipitation over south korea have a lag time of four seasons on the other hand ho et al 2016 argued that the effect of enso on seasonal precipitation does not appear to be systematic they concluded that the seasonal precipitation variability in south korea cannot be explained in terms of enso activities and that the major factors in modulating the seasonal precipitation in south korea remain unknown they also stated the necessity of long range precipitation forecasts as compared to short term forecasts due to the chaotic nature of the climate system although previous studies attempted to identify the relationships between climate indices and long term precipitation in south korea these studies did not take into account the inherent cycles in the long term precipitation to enhance our understanding of the behavior of long term precipitation in south korea there is a need to consider the inherent cycles in investigating the relationship between climate indices and long term precipitation in south korea therefore the hidden components within the long term precipitation were identified by eemd and various climate indices were used in the present study subsequently the relationships between the hidden components and climate indices were examined the objectives of this study were to 1 identify the climate indices which can be indicators of a long term trend and periodic oscillations that affect the long term precipitation using data from 60 meteorological stations in south korea via statistical methods such as eemd cross correlation analysis and stepwise variable selection and 2 investigate the statistical relationship between the identified climate indices and monthly precipitation by multiple linear regression analysis correlation coefficients corr and root mean square errors rmse were used to measure the performances of the multiple linear regression models and standardized correlation coefficients were employed to examine the relative importance of the identified climate indices on prediction of monthly precipitation the rest of this paper is organized as follows section 2 describes the methodology of the statistical methods used in this study namely eemd

precipitation in south korea several statistical analyses were carried out and the procedure to identify the climate indices is illustrated in fig 1 eemd was applied to extract the inherent oscillatory components namely the imfs in the monthly total precipitation cross correlation analysis was conducted to find correlations between the decomposed components and 25 global climate indices considering time lags up to 12 months the three most highly correlated top3 climate indices were selected for the decomposed components in other words each decomposed component had the top 3 climate indices stepwise variable selection was performed based on multiple regressions to find the significant climate indices among those selected from cross correlation analysis the climate indices that affect the long term precipitation were identified based on selection frequencies from the results of stepwise variable selection finally multiple linear regression analysis was carried out to investigate the influences of the identified climate indices on the prediction of monthly precipitation the detailed methodologies and theoretical background of the used methods are described in the following subsections 2 1 ensemble empirical mode decomposition eemd emd decomposes nonlinear and nonstationary data series for extracting a finite number of decomposed components termed as imfs each imf shows an oscillatory pattern which may represent physically meaningful information hidden in the original data series the imfs should satisfy two conditions 1 the number of extrema and zero crossings must either be equal to each other or differ at most by one in the whole data series and 2 the mean value of the upper envelope defined by connecting all the local maxima and the lower envelope defined by connecting all the local minima should be zero at any point huang et al 1998 emd is performed by an iterative process called a sifting algorithm as follows 1 find the upper and lower envelopes by connecting the local maxima x u t and local minima x l t using the cubic spline method for a given time series x t t 1 2 3 t t is data length 2 calculate the mean value between the local maxima and local minima that is x mean t x u t x l t 2 3 obtain h t by extracting the x mean t from the original time series x t that is h t x t x mean t 4 check whether h t satisfies the two conditions of imfs or not if h t is an imf h t is the first imf of the given time series else treat x t as h t and iterate steps 1 to 3 until h t satisfies the two conditions of imfs 5 define a new time series n t by extracting imf t from the original time series x t that is n t x t imf t and the original time series x t is replaced by n t 6 repeat steps 1 to 5 until no more imfs can be extracted and the last imf becomes the residue r t 7 finally the original time series x t can be written as eq 1 1 x t i 1 m imf i t r t where m is the number of imfs emd suffers the drawbacks caused by the appearance of mode mixing which is a specific signal retained in different imf components to ameliorate the drawbacks caused by the mode mixing problem wu and huang 2009 proposed eemd eemd is a noise assisted analysis method that sifts data with an added ensemble of white noise signals and treats the mean as the final result wu and huang 2009 a white noise signal is added to a given time series and it is decomposed by the sifting algorithm as described above different white noise signals are added to each repetition the ensemble means of the decomposed components can be obtained as the final result this additional step improves the results over the emd process by eliminating the chance of mode mixing and extracting improved physical meaning from the decomposed components lei et al 2009 zhang et al 2010 2 2 cross correlation analysis cross correlation analysis is a signal processing method that measures the similarity between two different time series considering a range of time lags the cross correlation coefficient r k demonstrates the strength of a linear relationship between the two time series which has a range from 1 0 to 1 0 if the value of r k is close to 1 0 or 1 0 there is a strong negative or positive relationship between the two time series respectively the correlation coefficient between the two time series x 1 and x 2 with a time lag k is defined by eq 2 box et al 1994 2 r k t 1 t k x 1 t x 1 t x 2 t k x 2 t t 1 t x 1 t x 1 t 2 t 1 t x 2 t x 2 t 2 where x 1 t and x 2 t are the sample means for each series k is allowed to be either positive or negative 2 3 stepwise variable selection stepwise variable selection is a method of selecting variables to build a regression model by adding or subtracting a variable from the set of explanatory variables draper and smith 1998 it can provide statistically significant variables for a regression model there are three main approaches for stepwise variable selection forward selection backward elimination and bidirectional elimination forward selection starts with no variables a null model and adds the variable that gives the most statistically significant improvement to the model fit backward elimination starts with all the predictive variables a full model and removes the variable that gives the most statistically insignificant reduction in the model fit bidirectional elimination is a combination of these two methods in that it uses a forward selection procedure with the possibility of removing a selected variable at each stage through backward elimination in the present study the bidirectional elimination method was used to determine a regression model since it takes advantage offered by both forward selection and backward elimination wang et al 2016 for implementing the bidirectional elimination we used the leaps package in r software lumley 2017 2 4 multiple linear regression model multiple linear regression is used to explain the relationship between a response variable and a number of explanatory variables the general form of a multiple linear regression model is the following equation with a response variable predicted data y t and explanatory variables x p t 3 y t Œ≤ 0 p 1 n Œ≤ p x p t Œµ where n is the number of explanatory variables Œ≤ 0 is a constant term intercept Œ≤ p are the regression coefficients for explanatory variables and Œµ is a noise term the method of least squares estimation is used to estimate parameters corr and rmse are used to measure the performance of the multiple linear regression models corr is obtained by eq 2 when the k 0 rmse represents the magnitudes of the errors in prediction between the two time series as defined by eq 4 4 rmse 1 t t 1 t y t x t 2 where y t and x t are the predicted and observed monthly precipitation in the context of analyzing the multiple linear regression model application of standardized regression coefficients allows us to measure the relative importance of the explanatory nathans et al 2012 since the coefficients of the multiple linear regression model are standardized to have zero mean and standard deviation as one the importance of explanatory variables can be compared to each other without considering their scales as a result an explanatory variable with larger absolute standardized regression coefficient has a greater influence on a response variable than other variables with smaller absolute standardized regression coefficients 3 data and study region 3 1 monthly total precipitation in south korea south korea is located in northeast asia and has a geographical characteristic that the three sides east west and south are surrounded by the sea korean meteorological administration kma operates the meteorological stations and controls the quality of data in south korea in this study we used monthly total precipitation from a total of 60 meteorological stations of the kma with more than 40 years records geographical locations of the meteorological stations are presented in fig 2 and the information of the stations is given in table 1 long term precipitation measured on a monthly basis in south korea demonstrates cyclic patterns including climatic characteristics for example heavy rainfall concentrated in the summer rainy season to summarize the seasonal variation in monthly precipitation for all stations a box and whisker plot was illustrated in fig 3 there was an apparent seasonal variation in the monthly precipitation the largest amount of precipitation including extremes occurred in the summer rainy season june to september a relatively small amount of precipitation was also recorded in the spring and autumn seasons april may october and november the lowest amount of precipitation was recorded in the winter dry season december to march 3 2 climate indices monthly atmosphere and ocean time series each climate index is a quantity used to characterize one aspect of the geophysical system ncar 2015 there are many climate indices to measure and monitor the geophysical system as any one climate index cannot measure the entire geophysical system perfectly to characterize aspects of the specific climate modes different climate indices were derived by different measurements from the original monthly records in this study a total of 25 climate indices were employed to determine the most statistically related indices as predictors for monthly precipitation in south korea the climate indices were grouped into four types sea surface temperature multiple index atmospheric circulation and others to represent the influence on atmospheric and oceanic circulation patterns based on the climatic modes table 2 shows a list and brief description of the climate indices used in this study 4 results and discussion 4 1 decomposition results in this study the monthly precipitation was decomposed into a finite number of decomposed components with added white noise with an amplitude of 0 2 times the standard deviation of the original data and the ensemble size set to 250 since the total number of imfs of a data series is roughly close to log 2 t where t is the data length a total of seven or eight imfs were extracted from each meteorological station wu et al 2007 fig 4 shows an example of the decomposed components by eemd at mungyeong station no 273 located near the center of south korea as the decomposition proceeded upper order imfs showed a lower frequency level and vice versa the residue has a monotonic function representing the long term trend of the monthly precipitation the decomposed components have mean periods obtained by dividing the total number of data by the number of extrema fig 5 presents the box and whisker plots of the mean periods of the decomposed components for all stations the mean periods represent different levels of climatic variability from interannual to multidecadal time scales and their ranges become widely dispersed depending on the order the imf1 to imf3 contained about 3 6 12 month cycles respectively that indicate the presence of seasonality the imf4 to imf6 represented cycles that correspond to approximately 2 6 years the imf7 and imf8 indicated the cycles were longer than a 10 year timescale oscillation 4 2 cross correlation analysis between climate indices and decomposed components cross correlation analysis considering time lags from 0 to 12 months were conducted between the decomposed components of the monthly precipitation series and twenty five climate indices if a climate index had different time lags it was treated as an independent climate index therefore a total of 325 13 time lags 25 climate indices cross correlation coefficients r k were calculated for each station and the top3 climate indices corresponding to the decomposed components were selected based on the absolute value of r k table 3 presents the top 3 climate indices for the decomposed components based on the value of r k at mungyeong station no 273 high values of r k are detected in the imf3 and residue the nino12 index 4 month lag r k 0 81 in the imf3 provides the highest value of r k the top 3 indices at the imf3 are mainly related to enso indices the globalt index no lag r k 0 80 in the residue provides the second highest r k of the top 3 climate indices and the amo index no lag r k 0 70 provides the third highest value of r k 4 3 multiple linear regression analysis 4 3 1 identification of the climate indices that affect long term precipitation in south korea the stepwise variable selection method was performed using the climate indices leading to three highest linear correlations for each decomposed component and station in the results of cross correlation analysis in this study we used a bidirectional elimination approach with aic criteria significant climate indices were selected for each station the number of selected variables ranged from three to eleven averaging at seven table 4 shows the most frequently selected climate indices up to the third rank in column order for the decomposed components and their mean values of r k the climate indices with relatively high value of r k appear in the imf2 imf3 and residue the climate indices selected in the imf2 and imf3 are all classified as enso sst pacific which is the enso related indices among these nino indices the nino12 index shows a higher correlation coefficient than the other nino indices such as nino34 and nino3 on the other hand the climate indices selected in the residue are mainly classified as sst atlantic the climate indices that affect the long term precipitation in south korea were identified based on the selection frequencies of the selected climate indices from the results of stepwise variable selection for all stations table 5 presents a list of the identified climate indices and their selection frequencies the climate index with the highest value of r k is nino12 with a 4 month lag and it is selected as a significant index for 43 out of a total of 60 stations 71 67 the climate index with second highest value of r k was nino12 with a 10 month lag and it is selected for 39 stations 65 therefore the nino12 index was finally selected as a significant indicator with the highest correlation coefficient and the highest selection frequencies across south korea in addition the climate index with the third highest value of r k was the amo no lag index which mostly demonstrates significance at the imf7 imf8 or residue that have cycles longer than a decade oscillations consequently the nino12 4 month lag index is the primary climate index for monthly precipitation the past patterns of nino12 indices give important predictive information for periodic oscillations of monthly precipitation the behavior of amo index also provides information for the long term trend of monthly precipitation to examine the relationships between the identified climate indices and decomposed components imf2 imf3 and the residue of mungyoung station no 273 and their identified climate indices are plotted as an example in fig 6 the y axes on the left hand side are the scales for imf2 imf3 and residue and those on the right hand side are the scales of the three identified climate indices note that the imf2 and nino12 4 month lag index have similar fluctuation in their oscillatory patterns in fig 6 a although there are slight differences in amplitude and frequency we confirm that there is a positive correlation between the imf2 and nino12 4 month lag index the imf3 and nino12 10 month lag index show a completely opposite fluctuation in their oscillatory patterns as in fig 6 b there is a strong negative correlation between the imf3 and nino12 10 month lag index in fig 6 c the residue which represents the long term trend appears to be a slightly upward nonlinear trend over the entire period and its behavior is similar to the general tendency of amo no lag index notably the detection of the nino12 4 and 10 month lag indices supported the results of previous studies based on the statistically significant correlations between the precipitation patterns in south korea and the enso cycle jin et al 2005 suggested that the stronger the la nina event the less precipitation there is to be expected four or five months later lee and julien 2016 found that the stronger intensity of the el nino la nina forcing the larger smaller the precipitation overall in south korea with a lag time of four seasons furthermore we found detailed information about the predictive time lags of climate indices with six month intervals since the imf2 and imf3 have seasonality with the mean periods of 6 and 12 months respectively we confirmed that the nino12 4 and 10 month lags indices can explain the periodic oscillations in the monthly precipitation series it means that the seasonality of long term precipitation in south korea is the most consistent with the nino12 index which tends to have the largest variance than other nino indices trenberth 2016 previous studies have demonstrated that the amo index which indicates long time scale oceanic phenomena in the north atlantic ocean has influenced hydroclimatic variables for many regions of the continent enfield et al 2001 mccabe et al 2004 sutton and hodson 2005 zhang and delworth 2006 for the northeast asia region a physical mechanism was identified for the teleconnections for the asian summer monsoon that influence the climate of south korea a warm amo phase is associated with a large scale positive tropospheric temperature anomaly over eurasia therefore it increases the meridional gradient of tropospheric temperature delays monsoon withdrawal and enhances monsoon rainfall goswami et al 2006 li and bates 2007 found the physical mechanism that winters in east china tend to be warmer and wetter than normal in the wide northern area when the warm amo phase occurs by inducing negative surface air pressure anomalies in the hemispheric wide domain extending from the midlatitude north atlantic to midlatitude eurasia they suggested that the influence is physically reasonable and realistic interactions within large scale atmospheric circulation wang et al 2011 provided that the amo is possibly related to hydroclimatic variables in east asia by presenting a new tree ring reconstruction although it is a feature of the sea surface temperature in the north atlantic ocean basin in addition to these results based on physical mechanisms we found a significant positive correlation between the amo index and monthly precipitation in the long term phase therefore it was evident that the behavior of the amo index indicates a long term trend in monthly precipitation series of south korea located in northeast asia 4 3 2 investigation statistical relationship using a multiple linear regression model to understand the relationships between the identified climate indices and monthly precipitation and to assess the predictability of the identified climate indices in south korea multiple linear regression was conducted for all stations the calibration period was set until 2014 and the validation period was set to the two most recent years 2015 2016 the three identified climate indices in table 5 were used to predict the monthly precipitation as explanatory variables the multiple linear regression model used in this study is defined by eq 5 5 y t Œ≤ 0 Œ≤ 1 x 1 t k 1 Œ≤ 2 x 2 t k 2 Œ≤ 3 x 3 t k 3 where x 1 x 2 x 3 are the nino12 k 1 4 nino12 k 2 10 amo k 3 0 respectively t is time and k i is the time lag the regression coefficients Œ≤ 0 Œ≤ 1 Œ≤ 2 and Œ≤ 3 are determined by a least squares method in the calibration the corr of the 60 stations range from 0 281 to 0 673 with a mean of 0 601 mungyeong station no 273 records the highest corr among the regression models in the validation the corr range from 0 230 to 0 613 with a mean of 0 469 at the mungyeong station no 273 the corr of the validation period was 0 4685 very similar to the mean value fig 7 presents the observed precipitation and estimated precipitation by the multiple linear regression model at mungyeong station no 273 in the calibration period it is observed that monthly precipitation estimates from the regression model adequately reproduce the oscillatory patterns of observed monthly precipitation however underestimation is shown in predicting precipitation in the summer rainy season particularly for the large peaks this result was consistently observed at all employed stations in the validation period the predicted precipitation is overestimated in 2015 and underestimated in 2016 while maintaining the oscillation patterns the reason for the overestimation in 2015 is the occurrence of severe drought in the central region of south korea the precipitation characteristics in 2015 showed extreme weather conditions in that the amount of precipitation was only 35 that of a normal year high pressure in the northeast region caused severe drought in the central region and heavy precipitation in the south region of south korea the general pattern was restored in 2016 although the performance in the validation period was worse than in the calibration period due to these precipitation characteristics the overfitting problem did not occur in the multiple linear regression model because there was not a large discrepancy between the calibration and validation periods these critical behaviors of the regression models are consistent with those in other stations not shown here to evaluate the performance of the regression models the rmse of the calibration and validation periods for each month and all stations are presented in fig 8 in the calibration period the median rmses for each month are highest in the summer rainy season jun to sep with large variation and lowest in the winter dry season dec to mar with small variation in the validation period the median rmses for each month are equal to or smaller than in calibration period and the variation in rmse is much larger than in the calibration period due to the extreme weather conditions that occurred in 2015 throughout south korea although the performance by corr in the validation period was worse than in the calibration period median rmses for each month in the validation period are equal to or smaller than those in calibration period in addition the multiple linear regression models show better predictability in the winter dry season for both two periods the results indicate that the identified climate indices consistently provide a better understanding of monthly precipitation in the winter dry season than the summer rainy season by the multiple linear regression model this is due to the precipitation characteristics of south korea in which temporal and spatial variability of precipitation is very high seo et al 2015 heavy precipitation more than 70 of annual precipitation concentrates in the summer rainy season and predicting precipitation in the summer rainy season is more difficult than the east asian summer monsoon due to a variety of air masses such as tropical monsoon air cold dry air from the continent of asia north pacific subtropical high air cold moist air over the okhotsk sea and polar air that are not represented explicitly seo et al 2011 seo et al 2015 kim et al 2017 in addition the large peaks in summer precipitation in south korea are mainly driven by typhoons predicting the effects of typhoons on monthly precipitation is very difficult because of the complexities of typhoon influences such as pathway intensity and life span in addition the amount of precipitation by typhoons varies greatly depending on the rate of movement development conditions and the terrain it passes through the complex natural phenomena in precipitation characteristics of the summer rainy season make a limitation in precipitation prediction by the multiple linear regression model because it has to be parameterized by physical processes such as the occurrence of extreme precipitation and it is difficult to detect by large scale atmosphere ocean circulation patterns on the other hand the winter dry season shows more stable predictability than the summer rainy season due to lower variation additionally the multiple linear regression models were separately constructed with the identified climate indices for the summer rainy season jun jul aug sep jjas and the winter dry season nov dec jan feb ndjf at mungyeong station no 273 to compare the effects of identified climate indices on seasonal and long term precipitation the result showed that the ndjf season has a lower rmse 24 06 than the jjas season 125 06 because the amount of precipitation is small and the variability of the precipitation is also small however the corr in jjas and ndjf seasons 0 385 and 0 338 respectively are similar and both are lower than the original long term precipitation all monthly data this is because the identified climate indices were selected by considering climate variability in the long term precipitation data more than 40 years thus the identified climate indices are suited for predicting monthly precipitation rather than predicting specific seasons therefore this result shows that the identified climate indices related to the periodic oscillations and a long term trend can provide better predictive information for long term prediction than for predicting specific seasons maps of corr in the calibration and validation periods of the multiple linear regression models are shown in fig 9 for investigating spatial patterns kriging interpolation technique was applied to describe spatial distributions of corr in the calibration period the corr is highest in the central area and lowest in the northeast area fig 9 a this means that the performance of multiple linear regression models in inland areas is better than in coastal areas in the validation period the corr is higher in the slightly upper and lower inland areas then the coastal area especially the southeastern area fig 9 b although the corr values in the validation period are smaller than those in the calibration period the spatial distributions of corr values for the two periods seem similar except for the south area where heavy precipitation caused by extreme weather conditions occurred in the southeastern area in 2015 this can be explained by the geographical characteristics of south korea south korea is a relatively small region in which to consider the similar impacts of global climate indices however the three sides surrounding by the sea and mountainous terrain make a large variability in monthly precipitation the coastal areas are particularly vulnerable to the impact of tropical cyclones such as clouds convection and typhoons the primary energy source for these storms is warm ocean water therefore these storms are typically stronger when over or near water and weaken quite rapidly when over land in addition the effect of typhoons on south korea is very strong as described above especially the typhoons in the summer rainy season of south korea that mainly pass between the east sea and japan therefore the east coastal area in south korea is significantly affected by typhoons and has a large variability in monthly precipitation this suggests that the multiple linear regression model has a limitation in adequately representing the geographical climate characteristics in coastal areas such as moisture convection topography and typhoons these geographical climate characteristics are essential to make accurate precipitation predictions however it is difficult to consider the geographical characteristics because the identified climate indices represent large scale atmospheric ocean circulation patterns on the other hand the geographical characteristics in inland areas are relatively stable as compared to in coastal or island areas consequently the multiple linear regression model with the identified climate indices provided better performance in predicting monthly precipitation in inland areas than in coastal or island areas in both two periods to investigate the relative importance of the identified climate indices in monthly precipitation prediction the standardized regression coefficients are spatially described in fig 10 the nino12 4 month lag index shows the positive standardized regression coefficients for all stations as shown in fig 10 a overall absolute values of the standardized regression coefficients range from 0 4 to 0 6 the nino12 4 month lag index is the most important variable to predict the monthly precipitation in the multiple regression models the nino12 10 month lag index shows the negative standardized regression coefficients in a range of 0 4 to 0 2 for the most stations as shown in fig 10 b nino12 10 month lag index is the second most important variable in the multiple regression models these results support that these two indices nino12 with 4 10 month lags have large influences on the multiple linear regression models as explanatory variables the amo index has the lowest standardized regression coefficients in the range of 0 2 to 0 2 as shown in fig 10 c it has relatively lesser influence on the monthly precipitation prediction than the two indices described above particularly in the southern coastal areas the relative importance of the amo index is not significant overall spatial results of the standardized regression coefficients are similar with the results of the corr presented in fig 9 finally p values of the identified climate indices used in multiple linear regression models for all stations are illustrated to validate their statistical significance in fig 11 the p values of nino12 4 and 10 month lags indices are statistically significant at 5 significant level in all stations as shown in fig 11 a and b it is confirmed that the use of the nino12 4 and 10 month lags indices is essential to predict oscillatory patterns of monthly precipitation as evident by their significance at all stations on the other hand the p values of the regression coefficients for the amo index are not significant for all stations unlike the results of nino12 the p values of the regression coefficients are presented in fig 11 c the coefficients of the amo index are statistically significant in most of the central and northern inland areas at 5 significant level while the coefficients of the amo index in southeast of the coastal areas are insignificant the importance of amo index is lower than the nino12 4 and 10 month lags indices in the islands and coastal areas additionally the amo index can explain long term trend in the monthly precipitation of inland areas from the results it may be inferred that the long term trend of monthly precipitation in south korea are disturbed by the typhoons since occurrences and magnitudes of the typhoons may not show long term trend the prediction of monthly precipitation in coastal areas may be disturbed by the typhoons 5 conclusions in this study we identified the climate indices that are effective indicators for monthly precipitation in south korea by using linear relationships between the climate indices and long term precipitation for this purpose statistical methods such as eemd cross correlation analysis and stepwise variable selection were applied the multiple linear regression model was constructed to assess predictability with the three identified climate indices nino12 indices with four and ten month lags and amo index with no lag as explanatory variables and the relationships between monthly precipitation and identified climate indices were examined although the multiple linear regression model can only express linear relationships it was confirmed that the identified climate indices can interpret well the periodic oscillations and the long term trend in monthly precipitation therefore the prediction of long term precipitation using the identified climate indices makes it possible to understand intuitively the periodicity and trend that represent long term precipitation in south korea from the results of this study we drew several conclusions as follows 1 a finite number of decomposed components were found in monthly precipitation using eemd it was possible to identify periodic oscillations and long term trend in monthly precipitation through the cycles inherent in the decomposed components the climate indices with relatively high values of correlation coefficients r k mainly appeared in the imf2 imf3 and residue 2 more detailed information about the predictive time lags of climate indices was found depending on the nature of the decomposed components the nino12 index generally predicted the monthly precipitation that emerged four months later and again six months after that time these findings possibly support the detection of seasonality showing the positive and negative correlations in imf2 and imf3 which have 6 and 12 month cycles respectively based on a strong positive correlation between the amo index and residue we found that the amo index also affects the long term trend of monthly precipitation in south korea located in northeast asia 3 the identified climate indices in multiple linear regression models played the role of explanatory variables although the fitted model underestimated the large peaks in the rainy season we found that the identified climate indices were suitable for predicting the overall oscillatory patterns of the monthly precipitation and long term trend the corr in the center of inland area showed the highest values while the corr in island and the eastern coastal areas showed low values therefore it was confirmed that that the identified climate indices provide better information toward predicting monthly precipitation of the inland areas rather than that of the coastal or island areas 4 the nino12 4 month lag index showed the most influential index followed by the nino12 10 month lag index the coefficients of these two indices in multiple linear regression models were significant at 5 significance level for all stations the amo no lag index showed a relatively lower influence than these two indices our study may help to understand the inherent cycles of long term precipitation influenced by climate indices and to confirm the existence of periodic oscillations and long term trend for clarifying meaningful physical information with regard to long term precipitation precipitation prediction is necessary in south korea because streamflow is difficult to predict due to the presence of many hydraulic structures predicted precipitation can be used for long term water resources planning and management based on monthly precipitation such as dam and reservoir operation for hydropower and flood control water supply for agriculture industry domestic and integrated hydrological management for intake water water filtration drainage and water supply facilities this is very important because it directly affects water resource systems for the effective water resources system the decision should be determined and balanced based on quick and reliable predictions the multiple linear regression model used in this study has the advantage that it can predict monthly precipitation easily and quickly with the identified climate indices using fixed parameters for each station also it can provide more reliable precipitation estimates potentially taking into account large atmospheric ocean circulation patterns therefore the multiple linear regression model can be used for long term water resources management and planning in addition this study suggests the essential climate indices that should be preferentially considered as predictive indicators of a large atmospheric ocean circulation pattern to predict monthly precipitation in south korea however there is a limit to reveal the dynamical reason why the nino12 index is related to long term precipitation in south korea although there is a significant statistical relationship this dynamical reason should be deeply investigated in further study based on the atmospheric dynamics or physical phenomenon if so the statistical model will provide a consistent performance regardless of decades in addition to this further study is also needed to apply a model that focuses on predictability such as by using machine learning technology to overcome the limitations of the multiple linear regression model acknowledgement this research was supported by a grant 2017 mpss31 001 from supporting technology development program for disaster management funded by the ministry of the interior

7522,the objective of this study was to exploit the synergy between smos and smap based on vegetation optical depth vod to improve brightness temperature tb simulations and land surface soil moisture sm retrievals in arid regions of the world in the current operational algorithm of smap level 2 vegetation water content vwc is considered as a proxy to compute vod which is calculated by an empirical conversion function of ndvi avoiding the empirical estimation of vod the smos algorithm is used to retrieve simultaneously sm and vod from tb observations the present study attempted to improve smap tb simulations and sm retrievals by benefiting from the advantages of the smos l meb algorithm this was achieved by using a synergy method based on replacing the default value of smap vod with the retrieved value of vod from the smos multi angular and bi polarization observations of tb the insitu sm measurements used as reference sm in this study were obtained from the international soil moisture network ismn over 180 stations located in arid regions of the world furthermore four stations were randomly selected to analyze the temporal variations in vod and sm results of the synergy

unbiased root mean squared error ubrmse analyzing the temporal variations in vod showed that the smos vod conversely to the smap vod can better illustrate the presence of herbaceous plants and may be a better indicator of the seasonal changes in the vegetation density and biomass over the year keywords smap smos synergy vegetation optical depth œÑ œâ l meb 1 introduction the surface soil moisture

passive observations are sensitive to soil moisture and to vegetation optical depth vod a parameter used to estimate the extinction effect of the microwave radiations within the canopy wigneron et al 2017 therefore estimating vod is of great importance in order to accurately retrieve soil moisture konings et al 2016 several approaches exist for the estimation of vod as a necessary input into the l band algorithms for sm retrievals the approach used in the smap level 2 algorithm is based upon the work described by hunt et al 1996 in this approach vod is considered to be proportional to the total vegetation water content vwc and stem factor vwc as the total water weight in vegetation per unit area expressed in units of kg m2 is not a routinely measured quantity and indirect measurement methods have been used for its large scale mapping the most common method is to use normalized difference vegetation index ndvi as a proxy of vwc in this method vwc is considered as the sum of foliage water content which is estimated using ndvi and stem water content which is estimated using past field observations and leaf area index lai chan et al 2013 hunt et al 1996 however this method is not without challenges and there are several well known limitations of ndvi to estimate vwc the stem factor is an input parameter into the conversion function of ndvi into vwc this parameter is estimated empirically and relies on field observations over specific regions as a result there may be large uncertainty associated with extending the calculations globally also ndvi is reported to be prone to saturation effects due to the strong absorption in the red wavelength sellers 1985 as a result its sensitivity to vwc is decreased as the water content reaches a threshold jackson et al 1999 especially over dense vegetation coverage and high lai chen and brutsaert 1998 gamon et al 1995 furthermore ndvi represents chlorophyll rather than water content gamon et al 1995 gao 1996 because it is calculated by using the red and near infrared bands which is based on the strong absorption and high reflectance of vegetation canopies respectively moreover there are also issues associated with the land cover the international geosphere biosphere program igbp global land cover is used by the smap algorithm to derive the stem factor which is required to compute vwc the global land cover maps are always subject to some level of uncertainty and inconsistency due to using different remote sensing sensors and a variety of employed methods for creating the maps congalton et al 2014 in addition a land cover dependent method for deriving vwc is sensitive to errors in the land cover classifications as well as to variations in albedo within a certain land cover type konings et al 2016 finally although vod is dependent on vwc vegetation structure incidence angle frequency and polarization wigneron et al 2007 the baseline approach of the smap does not take into account the effect of polarization on vod an alternative approach exists and consists in simultaneous retrievals of vod and sm by using information from observations at both horizontal h and vertical v polarizations jackson et al 2002 meesters et al 2005 however this retrieval approach is sensitive to noise due to the high correlation of the observations made at the two h and v polarizations konings et al 2016 if multi angular data are available such as in the case of smos this type of noise can be reduced wigneron et al 1998 the smos algorithm uses the inversion of the l band microwave emission of the biosphere l meb model to retrieve simultaneously sm and vod from multi angular and bi polarization of tb observations wigneron et al 2007 direct vod retrievals from inversion of the l meb model are interesting because this approach avoids the empirical estimation of vod which is made in the smap algorithm and takes into account the effects of some important factors such as polarization standing vegetation litter and rainfall wigneron et al 2007 also this model is independent of land cover and therefore does not suffer from the limitations related to the land cover as mentioned earlier furthermore the accuracy and robustness of the l meb model has been proved theoretically wigneron et al 2000 and has been validated over many sites with a variety of soil and vegetation conditions against in situ measurements cano et al 2010 panciera et al 2009 pard√© et al 2004 wigneron et al 1995 wigneron et al 2007 the present paper aims to exploit a possible synergy approach between the smos and smap algorithms with the emphasis on vod and to find whether the smap algorithm level 2 can benefit from the smos vod product in order to improve the accuracy of tb simulations and sm retrievals in arid regions of the globe the paper is organized as follows section 2 describes the study area used data sets algorithms and methodology of this paper obtained results are shown and discussed in section 3 and concluded in section 4 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area arid regions of the world were selected as the study area in an attempt to address an additional crucial limitation to estimate ndvi in these regions the ndvi is very sensitive to the soil background reflectance in sparse vegetated areas elvidge and lyon 1985 huete et al 1985 and the error in estimating ndvi is increased in these regions because of the strong effect of the reflectance from the background soil ishiyama et al 1997 in regions where there are considerable soil brightness variations the soil effect on the vegetation index values is considerable huete 1988 in this study the arid regions were selected as the study area according to the updated world climate map of koppen geiger climate classification kottek et al 2006 four selected climate classes for this study are i arid desert hot bwh ii arid desert cold bwk iii arid steppe hot bsh and iv arid steppe cold bsk fig 1 2 2 data sets 2 2 1 smos level 3 products multi angular and dual polarization tb observations are acquired by the smos satellite launched in november 2009 to retrieve sm and vod simultaneously the smos satellite orbits the earth at a local overpass time of 06 00 am pm for ascending descending passes with temporal resolution of 3 days the smos mission aims to monitor sm at a depth of about 3 5 cm and an accuracy of 0 04 cm3 cm3 kerr et al 2012 the global smos level 3 daily products smos l3 are provided by the centre aval de traitement des donn√©es catds in the netcdf format projected on a global ease equal area scalable earth grid version 2 25 km in this study we used the sm products retrieved vod œÑ nadir radio frequency interferences rfi and data quality index dqx flags which are associated with this level of smos products the smos tb observations were not used in this study 2 2 2 smap level 3 radiometer products the nasa smap satellite launched in january 2015 is the most recent satellite for sm monitoring the passive sensor of smap is dedicated to estimate sm in the top 0 5 cm layer with an average ubrmse of no more than 0 04 cm3 cm3 over areas where vwc 5 kg m2 at the footprint measurement scale of 36 km entekhabi et al 2010 in this study the passive global level 3 daily products of smap smap l3 were obtained from nasa reverb metadata and service discovery tool in the netcdf format all required input parameters for sm retrievals including vod single scattering albedo œâ vwc land cover roughness parameters surface temperature freeze thaw fraction vertical and horizontal polarization of tb observations were obtained from the ancillary information associated with this level of smap products the spatial resolution of all mentioned parameters is 36 km projected on the ease v2 grid the main input to the smap level 2 algorithm is the level 1c tb product that contains the time ordered geolocated calibrated level 1b tb observations which have been corrected for atmospheric effects faraday rotation and low level rfi and then resampled to the fixed 36 km ease2 grid if the rfi encountered is too large to be corrected the tb data are flagged accordingly and no soil moisture retrieval is attempted smap algorithm development team 2016 the associated tb observations with the smap l3 are an average of all tb observations fore and aft look falling in each 36 km grid cell which are different from the raw tb data we used the smap tb observations associated with smap l3 as the input parameters of the radiative transfer model used in this study 2 2 3 in situ soil moisture measurements in situ measurements are required to evaluate any remotely sensed products the international soil moisture network ismn as a data center has provided a global source of in situ sm freely available through the internet where sm measurements are collected in a harmonized format dorigo et al 2011 the ismn contains the data of more than 55 networks which together contain more than 2000 stations the in situ sm observations were obtained from the ismn website https ismn geo tuwien ac at out of more than 1060 ismn stations which measure soil moisture in the top soil layer 0 5 cm 180 stations located in the arid regions of the globe were selected in north america and south africa fig 1 for this study stations over other arid regions of the world were not available note that the surface soil moisture content has a high spatial variation and in situ probes may not fully capture soil moisture heterogeneity within the satellite footprint however good correlations between point scale sm measurements and satellite products can be found in the literature albergel et al 2012 albergel et al 2009 brocca et al 2012 escorihuela and quintana segu√≠ 2016 fernandez moran et al 2017a b louvet et al 2015 parrens et al 2017 in addition since we used a large number of stations and also various statistics that focus on temporal variations the use of in situ measurements can be convincing 2 2 4 harmonized world soil database the harmonized world soil database hwsd is a worldwide available soil database in digital format it is a composite of regional and global soil databases which provides some useful information of soil mapping units such as sand fraction clay fraction and bulk density fao and isric 2012 these attributes are necessary to compute the soil dielectric constant which is required in the passive microwave sm retrieval algorithms the spatial resolution of hwsd ranges from 10 km to 50 km in different parts of the world depending on the reference database used in this study this database was obtained from the food and agriculture organization fao website http www fao org soils portal en 2 3 data preprocessing to ensure the quality of the data the smos data were filtered based on the quality flags associated with smos l3 the dqx and rfi are the flags used in our data selection kerr et al 2012 the data with a value of dqx 0 06 and rfi 30 were selected in this study these ratios were considered so that to keep sufficient data and to ensure the data quality al yaari et al 2014 also the following criteria were used to select the smap data 1 the rfi check was done based on the following conditions smap algorithm development team 2016 i 0 tb 320 and ii tbh tbv 2 freeze thaw fraction 0 and 3 surface temperature 273 k the latest two criteria were used to remove the data with frozen conditions the tb observations were rejected if one of the mentioned conditions was not fulfilled the time period used for this study was chosen so that both smap and smos data were available from april 2015 the start of smap operational acquisitions to november 2016 2 4 sm retrievals theoretical basis the overall sm retrieval process in the microwave mw region of the electromagnetic spectrum consists of two parts in the first part the thermal radiation from the earth surface is modeled and in the second part a dielectric mixing model is applied to obtain sm the fresnel reflectivity model is used to relate the output of these two parts dielectric constant and smooth soil reflectivity as follows ulaby and wilson 1985 1 r h smooth cos Œ∏ Œµ sin 2 Œ∏ 0 5 cos Œ∏ Œµ sin 2 Œ∏ 0 5 2 2 r v smooth Œµ cos Œ∏ Œµ sin 2 Œ∏ 0 5 Œµ cos Œ∏ Œµ sin 2 Œ∏ 0 5 2 where r p smooth is the smooth soil reflectivity p h or v Œ∏ is the incidence angle and Œµ is the complex dielectric constant of the soil water mixture the imaginary part of the dielectric constant is relatively small compared to the real part at the low frequency dobson et al 1985 hallikainen et al 1985 wang and schmugge 1980 the h q equation introduced by wang et al 1983 is used to convert the smooth surface reflectivity to the rough surface reflectivity as shown in the eq 3 3 r p rough 1 q r r p smooth q r r q smooth e h r cos nr p Œ∏ where hr and qr are roughness surface parameters p and q correspond to the h and v or v and h polarizations and nrp is dependent on the incidence angle Œ∏ to better account for multi angular and dual polarization measurements qr is often assumed to be zero at l band choudhury et al 1979 the rough surface reflectivity at microwave frequency is related to the emissivity by 4 r p rough 1 e p rough atmosphere is a layer between the land and remotely sensed sensor so the total tb tb p t measured by the sensor is the sum of land radiated tb tb p l and atmospheric emission the smap l1b tb data have been corrected for atmospheric effects faraday rotation and low level rfi effects prior to regridding to the fixed 36 km ease2 grid o neill et al 2015 tb p l is dependent on the frequency and polarization and was formulated by mo et al 1982 this formulation is known as the œÑ œâ model 5 tb p l t s e p rough e œÑ t c 1 œâ 1 e œÑ e œÑ t c 1 œâ 1 e œÑ 1 e p rough where œÑ is the vod œâ is the effective scattering albedo tc and ts are the physical temperatures of the vegetation and soil layers respectively the two œâ and œÑ parameters are used to represent the vegetation scattering and extinction effects caused by the canopy layer above the soil which are dependent on polarization frequency incidence angle and vwc van de griend and wigneron 2004 œâ can be computed through calibration using experimental or numerical data or based on physical considerations wigneron et al 2017 the second part of the sm retrieval process is to relate sm and the soil dielectric constant in the past few decades a number of soil dielectric mixing models have been developed to relate these two parameters dobson et al 1985 mironov et al 2009 wang and schmugge 1980 the main input parameters of these models are sm the effective soil temperature tg sand fraction clay fraction and bulk density of soil the mironov model as the dielectric model used in the current retrieval algorithms of the smos and smap was used in this study this model requires sm tg and clay fraction wigneron et al 2017 3 methods 3 1 tb simulations fig 2 illustrates schematically the methodology of this study the forward model of œÑ œâ was applied to simulate tb using in situ sm measured at the ismn stations in order to evaluate the impact of polarization on the obtained results single channel algorithm sca based on i v polarized tb data sca v and ii h polarized tb data sca h was used to simulate tb from a broad perspective there are four steps involved in the forward model as follows 1 relating sm to the soil dielectric properties by the mironov model 2 relating the soil dielectric properties to the smooth soil reflectivity by the fresnel equations 3 accounting for the effects of soil surface roughness by the h q model and finally 4 considering the effects of vegetation and simulating tb by using the œÑ œâ model in this study we used the default values of smap vod smos vod and averaging of the smos vod values using different moving windows 5 15 and 35 days the use of moving average windows as the most common technique for filtering time series data draper et al 2011 helped removing noises and possibly artificial high frequency variations in the vod time series smos vod is retrieved simultaneously with the sm from the smos multi angular and bi polarization observations of tb smap vod is estimated from the vwc as 6 œÑ nad b vwc where b is the stem factor and is obtained by means of a land cover lookup table the vod products used in this study were obtained from the associated ancillary information with the level 3 products of smap and smos a summary of the input parameters used for the simulation process and sm retrievals is given in table 1 3 2 sm retrievals since the sca v is the current operational algorithm of smap l2 we used this algorithm to retrieve sm over all 180 stations the inversion of the œÑ œâ model was carried out by minimizing a cost function using a generalized least squares iterative algorithm fernandez moran et al 2017b pard√© et al 2004 7 cf tb o tb s 2 œÉ tb 2 sm sm ini 2 œÉ sm 2 tbo

set equal to 2 in this study sm and smini was set equal to 0 01 in this study are the retrieved and initial values of sm respectively 3 3 the synergy method the new approach used in the present study hereafter is referred to as the synergy method is based on replacing the default value of the smap vod with the value of the smos vod œÑ nadir in the forward model four various options of smos vod smos vod 5 15 and 35 day moving average of smos vod were tested according to the obtained results of the forward model only 15 day moving average of smos vod was used in the inverse synergy method for sm retrievals 3 4 metrics used for comparisons to compare the measured values of tb sm and the simulated retrieved values of tb sm four statistical criteria including coefficient of determination r2 the mean difference bias the root mean squared error rmse and the unbiased root mean squared error ubrmse were computed as follows 8 bias 1 n i 1 n s i m i r m s e 1 n i 1 n s i m i 2 u b r m s e r m s e 2 b i a s 2 r 2 1 n 1 i 1 n s i s œÉ s m i m œÉ m 2 where si is the ith simulated retrieved value mi is the ith measured value n is the total number of observations œÉs and œÉm are the standard deviations and overbar of m and s are the mean of measured and simulated retrieved values respectively it should be noted that all the statistics metrics were computed on dates available in all the three data sets smap smos and in situ sm therefore the number of the data for these three datasets are identical the minimum and maximum number of days in which all three data sets were available are respectively 66 for pbo h2o buckleyflt station and 238 days for uscrn wolf point 29 ene station in the time period of this study from april 2015 to november 2016 3 5 time series analysis of smap smos vod the time series analysis over some selected sites have been used in a number of previous studies as an evaluation method albergel et al 2012 escorihuela and quintana segu√≠ 2016 konings et al 2016 in order to get a better understanding of the results we analyzed the time series of vod and insitu soil moisture over a few stations to do so we randomly selected four stations out of 180 stations table 2 4 results and discussion in the following sections the obtained results are presented in section 3 1 the results of tb simulations and in section 3 2 the results of sm retrievals are presented in section 3 3 the results of temporal variations in vod as well as insitu sm over the four selected stations are explained 4 1 tb simulations 4 1 1 simulated tbv vs tbh fig 3 shows the value of r2 and ubrmse between the simulated tb by using in situ sm and measured smap tb all required parameters for the simulation process excluding sm which was obtained from ismn were considered the same as those used in the current operational smap level 2 algorithm horizontally polarized tb data are traditionally used due to their sensitivity to soil moisture o neill et al 2015 however it is worth noting that in comparison to tbh observations simulated tbv showed higher r2 and lower ubrmse in this study to compare tbv and tbh the following conditions were considered r2 greater than 0 5 and ubrmse 10 k the results showed that out of 180 stations 81 stations showed ubrmse 10 k and 93 stations showed r2 greater than 0 5 at v polarization while 26 stations showed ubrmse 10 k and 58 stations showed r2 greater than 0 5 at h polarization it should be noted that the lower values of ubrmse may be due to lower range of tbv values compared to the range of tbh values however we found better results for tbv in terms of both r2 and ubrmse this finding is in good agreement with those found in the literature miernecki et al 2014 o neill et al 2015 note that the large ubrmse values are not only related to the errors associated with the tb observations but also due to non representativity of point in situ sm input inaccurate vod input and other input parameters into the radiative transfer model wigneron et al 2017 4 1 2 results of tb simulations in the results given above the smap tb simulations were made using the vod values given in the smap algorithm and estimated from ndvi in this section we investigated whether the smap tb simulations could be improved using the synergy method i e using vod values retrieved from smos tb observations table 3 compares the number of stations where the synergy method improved the results in terms of r2 and ubrmse according to table 3 the use of 15 day moving average of smos vod in the forward model showed the better results in most stations improved results were generally obtained at the v polarization therefore hereafter we focus on this configuration sca v based on 15 day moving average of smos vod for further analysis of the results fig 4 shows the values of r2 and ubrmse between the measured tbv by smap and the simulated tbv by the synergy method over 180 stations the maximum and minimum values are respectively 0 92 0 06 for r2 and 20 29 k 2 62 k for ubrmse the improvements in terms of r2 and ubrmse due to employing the synergy method are presented in fig 5 out of 180 stations located in arid regions of the world both r2 and ubrmse values increased in 144 stations 0 01 r2 improvement 0 33 and 0 01 ubrmse improvement 12 kelvin while no improvement was observed in 9 stations furthermore 171 stations showed improvement in at least one of the two metrics of r2 or ubrmse fig 5 the maximum and minimum values of improvement in terms of ubrmse were respectively found in snotel and pbo h2o networks table 4 compares the predominant land cover classes of the improved and unimproved stations this comparison shows that the synergy method gives the better results over grasslands improvement in 85 percent of the grassland stations compared to the other land covers the l band emission of grasslands is complex as it is a combination of the emitted radiation of soil litter and the grass itself saleh et al 2007 the l meb model takes into account numerous effects such as standing vegetation litter and intercepted water by the vegetation canopy wigneron et al 2007 therefore these different effects may explain why the use of smos vod in the synergy method leads to improved results in grasslands 4 2 results of sm retrievals results of the inverse synergy method over all 180 stations showed that by using the sca v based on 15 day moving average of smos vod the accuracy of sm retrievals was improved in terms of r2 ubrmse and both metrics over 141 139 and 124 stations out of a total of 180 stations respectively fig 6 shows the amount of accuracy improvement in terms of r2 and ubrmse due to using the synergy method fig 7 presents the comparison of the retrieved sm products by using the synergy method smap sm products and smos sm products the median and mean value of statistical metrics over a large number of sites has been used in the literature to compare the various products albergel et al 2012 fernandez moran et al 2017b in this study the mentioned tree products were evaluated against in situ measurements over 180 stations in terms of median and mean r2 rmse absolute bias and ubrmse the results indicated that the synergy products led to higher median and mean value for r2 and lower median and mean values for rmse absolute bias and ubrmse in comparison with the other products the poorest results were obtained for the smos sm products probably due to the rfi contamination of smos products or to issues linked to the modeling of heterogeneous pixels in the smos l3 algorithm fernandez moran et al 2017a 4 3 time series analysis of vods the comparison between the temporal variations in insitu soil moisture and smos smap vod is presented in fig 8 over the four randomly selected sites presented in section 3 5 generally the trend of the smap vod is in good agreement with the seasonal behavior of vegetation the smap vod is linked to biomass and increases in summer as the biomass increases as can be seen in fig 8 the smap vod shows an increase from spring until summer during the crop growth phase and a decrease in fall and winter the maximum values can be seen from june to september which corresponds to the growing season of vegetation and the maximum amount of water per unit of ground area is contained within the vegetation however the smap vod time series are very smooth and do not show weekly or monthly variations in the vegetation biomass especially over panther station fig 8d fig 8 shows that the smos vod is a more dynamic parameter than the smap vod and that it is more consistent with the in situ sm temporal variations since the predominant land cover of three of the stations is grassland table 4 it is expected that temporal variations in soil moisture rapidly affect the grasslands and herbaceous plants this effect can be seen in the smos vod time series while the smap vod time series are relatievly smooth and only show the general seasonal pattern of vegetation in addition there is one smos vod peak over the three stations where the predominant landcover is grassland from march to june which can not be seen in the smap vod star signs in fig 8 a b c also there is a high peak in sm due to precipitation in winter plus signs in fig 8 the lag time between this peak value in winter and the high values of smos vod in spring is a result of the delay time in the begining of the growing season therefore we may assume that the smos vod can better show the variations in the biomass of grasses and herbaceous plants and their behavior during the growing season however the variability of the smos vod appears very high with several peaks throughout the year compared to what can be expected from typical vegetation phenology one possible interpretation of the low sensivity of the smap vod to the starting season of grasses is that smap vod is a function of vwc calculated from ndvi as discussed in the introduction section ndvi is not a good indicator of the vegetation status in arid regions due to the strong effects of the reflectance from the background soil it is worth noting that there is a good agreement between the in situ sm and smos vod over the panther station fig 8 d where the predominant landcover is open shrubland while smap vod does not show any considerable agreement in addition a 1 3 days lag time can be seen between high recorded values of insitu sm vertical lines in fig 8 d and smos vod this lag time may be due to the delay in water absorbed by the shrubs therefore we may assume that smos vod is also a good indicator of the impact of sm variations on the vegetation water content over shrublands for more accurate and precise conclusion future work will investigte this research topic based on ground biomass observations the results of the tb simulations as well as the temporal variations in sm vod emphasized that smos vod may be a better indicator of the vegetation status in comparison to the smap vod therefore the synergy method can be considered as a potential method for sm retrievals table 5 shows the values of r2 rmse bias and ubrmse between the in situ and retrieved sm and also between the measured and simulated tb over the 4 selected sites note that all the comparisons yielded p values 0 indicating the high statistical significance of the results given in terms of correlation to make the results of the inverse and forward model comparable the results of sca v are shown in table 5 these results showed that the synergy method could improve the sm retrievals as well 0 01 r2 improvement 0 035 and 0 ubrmse improvement 0 002 k however the results of the sm retrievals over three stations wagonmound cper and disaster peak did not fulfill the typical target accuracy of the smap and smos missions 0 04 m3 m3 5 conclusion a possible synergy approach based on vod between the smos and smap algorithms was exploited here to improve the smap tb simulations and sm retrievals the results indicated that the synergy method improved the results of smap tb simulations and sm retrievals respectively over 144 and 124 stations out of a total of 180 stations in terms of r2 and ubrmse values this improvement can be related to the advantages of the l meb inversion method this method avoids the empirical estimation of vod from ndvi and takes into account the effects of standing vegetation polarization incidence angle litter and rainfall and it is not dependent on the land cover in addition the comparison of the retrieved sm products by using the synergy method smap sm products and smos sm products indicated that the synergy products led to higher median and mean value for r2 and lower values for rmse and ubrmse in comparison with the other products furthermore the analysis of the temporal variations in vod suggested that the smos vod conversely to the smap vod may better capture the time variations in the cover fraction of the herbaceous plants the smap vod is a function of vwc which is estimated by using ndvi as discussed in the introduction section ndvi is not a good indicator of the vegetation biomass especially in the arid regions consequently smap vod did not seem to be a reliable source of information about the biomass of herbaceous plants and could not well discern its time variations we also found a good agreement between the time variations in the in situ sm and smos vod especially over a station with shrubland vegetation fig 8 d however the high variability of the smos vod showed that it is relatively noisy and it should be averaged using a sliding window method optimal time period 15 days these findings lead us to the overall conclusion that the synergy method is interesting for smap tb simulations and sm retrievals however there remains much room for improvement and several issues are still to be addressed these preliminary results were obtained over arid sites and a larger extent evaluation is required before any decisive conclusion could be drawn the mismatch between the footprint of smap smos and other input parameters to the model is an important issue that ought to be considered in future analyses furthermore it should be noted that comparing point scale ismn soil moisture measurements with large footprint of satellite products propagate uncertainty into the retrieval algorithm future researches should extend this work to global scale by using more sites across the world and using the improved smos ic vod data set fernandez moran et al 2017a in the latter data set issues associated with the modeling of heterogeneous pixels in the smos l3 algorithm have been solved the proposed synergy method of this paper should be tested in the most representative core validation

7522,the objective of this study was to exploit the synergy between smos and smap based on vegetation optical depth vod to improve brightness temperature tb simulations and land surface soil moisture sm retrievals in arid regions of the world in the current operational algorithm of smap level 2 vegetation water content vwc is considered as a proxy to compute vod which is calculated by an empirical conversion function of ndvi avoiding the empirical estimation of vod the smos algorithm is used to retrieve simultaneously sm and vod from tb observations the present study attempted to improve smap tb simulations and sm retrievals by benefiting from the advantages of the smos l meb algorithm this was achieved by using a synergy method based on replacing the default value of smap vod with the retrieved value of vod from the smos multi angular and bi polarization observations of tb the insitu sm measurements used as reference sm in this study were obtained from the international soil moisture network ismn over 180 stations located in arid regions of the world furthermore four stations were randomly selected to analyze the temporal variations in vod and sm results of the synergy method showed that the accuracy of the tb simulations and sm retrievals was respectively improved at 144 and 124 stations out of a total of 180 stations in terms of coefficient of determination r2 and unbiased root mean squared error ubrmse analyzing the temporal variations in vod showed that the smos vod conversely to the smap vod can better illustrate the presence of herbaceous plants and may be a better indicator of the seasonal changes in the vegetation density and biomass over the year keywords smap smos synergy vegetation optical depth œÑ œâ l meb 1 introduction the surface soil moisture sm governs the partitioning of the energy fluxes between the land and the atmosphere brocca et al 2017 thus is of great importance in the hydrological cycle brocca et al 2007 corradini 2014 wagner et al 2007 sm is an important variable for many applications such as flood modeling brocca et al 2010 landslide prediction brocca et al 2012 drought assessment rahmani et al 2016 agriculture korres et al 2013 rodr√≠guez iturbe and porporato 2007 hydrology vereecken et al 2014 land atmosphere interaction and climate studies entekhabi et al 1996 it plays a critical role in many hydrological processes such as precipitation runoff infiltration and evaporation puri et al 2011 l band passive microwave has received much attention over the last two decades to monitor sm from space due to its advantages such as transparent atmosphere transmission of signals from the underlying soil semi transparent vegetation strong dependency on the soil dielectric properties which are a function of sm and being independent of solar illumination in comparison with other remote sensing techniques hong and shin 2011 jackson 1993 njoku and entekhabi 1996 schmugge 1998 the nasa soil moisture active passive smap entekhabi et al 2010 and the european space agency esa soil moisture and ocean salinity smos kerr et al 2012 are two recent l band satellites that measure sm in the top layer of soil the l band passive observations are sensitive to soil moisture and to vegetation optical depth vod a parameter used to estimate the extinction effect of the microwave radiations within the canopy wigneron et al 2017 therefore estimating vod is of great importance in order to accurately retrieve soil moisture konings et al 2016 several approaches exist for the estimation of vod as a necessary input into the l band algorithms for sm retrievals the approach used in the smap level 2 algorithm is based upon the work described by hunt et al 1996 in this approach vod is considered to be proportional to the total vegetation water content vwc and stem factor vwc as the total water weight in vegetation per unit area expressed in units of kg m2 is not a routinely measured quantity and indirect measurement methods have been used for its large scale mapping the most common method is to use normalized difference vegetation index ndvi as a proxy of vwc in this method vwc is considered as the sum of foliage water content which is estimated using ndvi and stem water content which is estimated using past field observations and leaf area index lai chan et al 2013 hunt et al 1996 however this method is not without challenges and there are several well known limitations of ndvi to estimate vwc the stem factor is an input parameter into the conversion function of ndvi into vwc this parameter is estimated empirically and relies on field observations over specific regions as a result there may be large uncertainty associated with extending the calculations globally also ndvi is reported to be prone to saturation effects due to the strong absorption in the red wavelength sellers 1985 as a result its sensitivity to vwc is decreased as the water content reaches a threshold jackson et al 1999 especially over dense vegetation coverage and high lai chen and brutsaert 1998 gamon et al 1995 furthermore ndvi represents chlorophyll rather than water content gamon et al 1995 gao 1996 because it is calculated by using the red and near infrared bands which is based on the strong absorption and high reflectance of vegetation canopies respectively moreover there are also issues associated with the land cover the international geosphere biosphere program igbp global land cover is used by the smap algorithm to derive the stem factor which is required to compute vwc the global land cover maps are always subject to some level of uncertainty and inconsistency due to using different remote sensing sensors and a variety of employed methods for creating the maps congalton et al 2014 in addition a land cover dependent method for deriving vwc is sensitive to errors in the land cover classifications as well as to variations in albedo within a certain land cover type konings et al 2016 finally although vod is dependent on vwc vegetation structure incidence angle frequency and polarization wigneron et al 2007 the baseline approach of the smap does not take into account the effect of polarization on vod an alternative approach exists and consists in simultaneous retrievals of vod and sm by using information from observations at both horizontal h and vertical v polarizations jackson et al 2002 meesters et al 2005 however this retrieval approach is sensitive to noise due to the high correlation of the observations made at the two h and v polarizations konings et al 2016 if multi angular data are available such as in the case of smos this type of noise can be reduced wigneron et al 1998 the smos algorithm uses the inversion of the l band microwave emission of the biosphere l meb model to retrieve simultaneously sm and vod from multi angular and bi polarization of tb observations wigneron et al 2007 direct vod retrievals from inversion of the l meb model are interesting because this approach avoids the empirical estimation of vod which is made in the smap algorithm and takes into account the effects of some important factors such as polarization standing vegetation litter and rainfall wigneron et al 2007 also this model is independent of land cover and therefore does not suffer from the limitations related to the land cover as mentioned earlier furthermore the accuracy and robustness of the l meb model has been proved theoretically wigneron et al 2000 and has been validated over many sites with a variety of soil and vegetation conditions against in situ measurements cano et al 2010 panciera et al 2009 pard√© et al 2004 wigneron et al 1995 wigneron et al 2007 the present paper aims to exploit a possible synergy approach between the smos and smap algorithms with the emphasis on vod and to find whether the smap algorithm level 2 can benefit from the smos vod product in order to improve the accuracy of tb simulations and sm retrievals in arid regions of the globe the paper is organized as follows section 2 describes the study area used data sets algorithms and methodology of this paper obtained results are shown and discussed in section 3 and concluded in section 4 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area arid regions of the world were selected as the study area in an attempt to address an additional crucial limitation to estimate ndvi in these regions the ndvi is very sensitive to the soil background reflectance in sparse vegetated areas elvidge and lyon 1985 huete et al 1985 and the error in estimating ndvi is increased in these regions because of the strong effect of the reflectance from the background soil ishiyama et al 1997 in regions where there are considerable soil brightness variations the soil effect on the vegetation index values is considerable huete 1988 in this study the arid regions were selected as the study area according to the updated world climate map of koppen geiger climate classification kottek et al 2006 four selected climate classes for this study are i arid desert hot bwh ii arid desert cold bwk iii arid steppe hot bsh and iv arid steppe cold bsk fig 1 2 2 data sets 2 2 1 smos level 3 products multi angular and dual polarization tb observations are acquired by the smos satellite launched in november 2009 to retrieve sm and vod simultaneously the smos satellite orbits the earth at a local overpass time of 06 00 am pm for ascending descending passes with temporal resolution of 3 days the smos mission aims to monitor sm at a depth of about 3 5 cm and an accuracy of 0 04 cm3 cm3 kerr et al 2012 the global smos level 3 daily products smos l3 are provided by the centre aval de traitement des donn√©es catds in the netcdf format projected on a global ease equal area scalable earth grid version 2 25 km in this study we used the sm products retrieved vod œÑ nadir radio frequency interferences rfi and data quality index dqx flags which are associated with this level of smos products the smos tb observations were not used in this study 2 2 2 smap level 3 radiometer products the nasa smap satellite launched in january 2015 is the most recent satellite for sm monitoring the passive sensor of smap is dedicated to estimate sm in the top 0 5 cm layer with an average ubrmse of no more than 0 04 cm3 cm3 over areas where vwc 5 kg m2 at the footprint measurement scale of 36 km entekhabi et al 2010 in this study the passive global level 3 daily products of smap smap l3 were obtained from nasa reverb metadata and service discovery tool in the netcdf format all required input parameters for sm retrievals including vod single scattering albedo œâ vwc land cover roughness parameters surface temperature freeze thaw fraction vertical and horizontal polarization of tb observations were obtained from the ancillary information associated with this level of smap products the spatial resolution of all mentioned parameters is 36 km projected on the ease v2 grid the main input to the smap level 2 algorithm is the level 1c tb product that contains the time ordered geolocated calibrated level 1b tb observations which have been corrected for atmospheric effects faraday rotation and low level rfi and then resampled to the fixed 36 km ease2 grid if the rfi encountered is too large to be corrected the tb data are flagged accordingly and no soil moisture retrieval is attempted smap algorithm development team 2016 the associated tb observations with the smap l3 are an average of all tb observations fore and aft look falling in each 36 km grid cell which are different from the raw tb data we used the smap tb observations associated with smap l3 as the input parameters of the radiative transfer model used in this study 2 2 3 in situ soil moisture measurements in situ measurements are required to evaluate any remotely sensed products the international soil moisture network ismn as a data center has provided a global source of in situ sm freely available through the internet where sm measurements are collected in a harmonized format dorigo et al 2011 the ismn contains the data of more than 55 networks which together contain more than 2000 stations the in situ sm observations were obtained from the ismn website https ismn geo tuwien ac at out of more than 1060 ismn stations which measure soil moisture in the top soil layer 0 5 cm 180 stations located in the arid regions of the globe were selected in north america and south africa fig 1 for this study stations over other arid regions of the world were not available note that the surface soil moisture content has a high spatial variation and in situ probes may not fully capture soil moisture heterogeneity within the satellite footprint however good correlations between point scale sm measurements and satellite products can be found in the literature albergel et al 2012 albergel et al 2009 brocca et al 2012 escorihuela and quintana segu√≠ 2016 fernandez moran et al 2017a b louvet et al 2015 parrens et al 2017 in addition since we used a large number of stations and also various statistics that focus on temporal variations the use of in situ measurements can be convincing 2 2 4 harmonized world soil database the harmonized world soil database hwsd is a worldwide available soil database in digital format it is a composite of regional and global soil databases which provides some useful information of soil mapping units such as sand fraction clay fraction and bulk density fao and isric 2012 these attributes are necessary to compute the soil dielectric constant which is required in the passive microwave sm retrieval algorithms the spatial resolution of hwsd ranges from 10 km to 50 km in different parts of the world depending on the reference database used in this study this database was obtained from the food and agriculture organization fao website http www fao org soils portal en 2 3 data preprocessing to ensure the quality of the data the smos data were filtered based on the quality flags associated with smos l3 the dqx and rfi are the flags used in our data selection kerr et al 2012 the data with a value of dqx 0 06 and rfi 30 were selected in this study these ratios were considered so that to keep sufficient data and to ensure the data quality al yaari et al 2014 also the following criteria were used to select the smap data 1 the rfi check was done based on the following conditions smap algorithm development team 2016 i 0 tb 320 and ii tbh tbv 2 freeze thaw fraction 0 and 3 surface temperature 273 k the latest two criteria were used to remove the data with frozen conditions the tb observations were rejected if one of the mentioned conditions was not fulfilled the time period used for this study was chosen so that both smap and smos data were available from april 2015 the start of smap operational acquisitions to november 2016 2 4 sm retrievals theoretical basis the overall sm retrieval process in the microwave mw region of the electromagnetic spectrum consists of two parts in the first part the thermal radiation from the earth surface is modeled and in the second part a dielectric mixing model is applied to obtain sm the fresnel reflectivity model is used to relate the output of these two parts dielectric constant and smooth soil reflectivity as follows ulaby and wilson 1985 1 r h smooth cos Œ∏ Œµ sin 2 Œ∏ 0 5 cos Œ∏ Œµ sin 2 Œ∏ 0 5 2 2 r v smooth Œµ cos Œ∏ Œµ sin 2 Œ∏ 0 5 Œµ cos Œ∏ Œµ sin 2 Œ∏ 0 5 2 where r p smooth is the smooth soil reflectivity p h or v Œ∏ is the incidence angle and Œµ is the complex dielectric constant of the soil water mixture the imaginary part of the dielectric constant is relatively small compared to the real part at the low frequency dobson et al 1985 hallikainen et al 1985 wang and schmugge 1980 the h q equation introduced by wang et al 1983 is used to convert the smooth surface reflectivity to the rough surface reflectivity as shown in the eq 3 3 r p rough 1 q r r p smooth q r r q smooth e h r cos nr p Œ∏ where hr and qr are roughness surface parameters p and q correspond to the h and v or v and h polarizations and nrp is dependent on the incidence angle Œ∏ to better account for multi angular and dual polarization measurements qr is often assumed to be zero at l band choudhury et al 1979 the rough surface reflectivity at microwave frequency is related to the emissivity by 4 r p rough 1 e p rough atmosphere is a layer between the land and remotely sensed sensor so the total tb tb p t measured by the sensor is the sum of land radiated tb tb p l and atmospheric emission the smap l1b tb data have been corrected for atmospheric effects faraday rotation and low level rfi effects prior to regridding to the fixed 36 km ease2 grid o neill et al 2015 tb p l is dependent on the frequency and polarization and was formulated by mo et al 1982 this formulation is known as the œÑ œâ model 5 tb p l t s e p rough e œÑ t c 1 œâ 1 e œÑ e œÑ t c 1 œâ 1 e œÑ 1 e p rough where œÑ is the vod œâ is the effective scattering albedo tc and ts are the physical temperatures of the vegetation and soil layers respectively the two œâ and œÑ parameters are used to represent the vegetation scattering and extinction effects caused by the canopy layer above the soil which are dependent on polarization frequency incidence angle and vwc van de griend and wigneron 2004 œâ can be computed through calibration using experimental or numerical data or based on physical considerations wigneron et al 2017 the second part of the sm retrieval process is to relate sm and the soil dielectric constant in the past few decades a number of soil dielectric mixing models have been developed to relate these two parameters dobson et al 1985 mironov et al 2009 wang and schmugge 1980 the main input parameters of these models are sm the effective soil temperature tg sand fraction clay fraction and bulk density of soil the mironov model as the dielectric model used in the current retrieval algorithms of the smos and smap was used in this study this model requires sm tg and clay fraction wigneron et al 2017 3 methods 3 1 tb simulations fig 2 illustrates schematically the methodology of this study the forward model of œÑ œâ was applied to simulate tb using in situ sm measured at the ismn stations in order to evaluate the impact of polarization on the obtained results single channel algorithm sca based on i v polarized tb data sca v and ii h polarized tb data sca h was used to simulate tb from a broad perspective there are four steps involved in the forward model as follows 1 relating sm to the soil dielectric properties by the mironov model 2 relating the soil dielectric properties to the smooth soil reflectivity by the fresnel equations 3 accounting for the effects of soil surface roughness by the h q model and finally 4 considering the effects of vegetation and simulating tb by using the œÑ œâ model in this study we used the default values of smap vod smos vod and averaging of the smos vod values using different moving windows 5 15 and 35 days the use of moving average windows as the most common technique for filtering time series data draper et al 2011 helped removing noises and possibly artificial high frequency variations in the vod time series smos vod is retrieved simultaneously with the sm from the smos multi angular and bi polarization observations of tb smap vod is estimated from the vwc as 6 œÑ nad b vwc where b is the stem factor and is obtained by means of a land cover lookup table the vod products used in this study were obtained from the associated ancillary information with the level 3 products of smap and smos a summary of the input parameters used for the simulation process and sm retrievals is given in table 1 3 2 sm retrievals since the sca v is the current operational algorithm of smap l2 we used this algorithm to retrieve sm over all 180 stations the inversion of the œÑ œâ model was carried out by minimizing a cost function using a generalized least squares iterative algorithm fernandez moran et al 2017b pard√© et al 2004 7 cf tb o tb s 2 œÉ tb 2 sm sm ini 2 œÉ sm 2 tbo and tbs are the observed and simulated tb at Œ∏ 40 œÉtb is the standard deviation of the simulated tb was set equal to 2 k in this study œÉsm is the standard deviation of the initial value of sm was set equal to 2 in this study sm and smini was set equal to 0 01 in this study are the retrieved and initial values of sm respectively 3 3 the synergy method the new approach used in the present study hereafter is referred to as the synergy method is based on replacing the default value of the smap vod with the value of the smos vod œÑ nadir in the forward model four various options of smos vod smos vod 5 15 and 35 day moving average of smos vod were tested according to the obtained results of the forward model only 15 day moving average of smos vod was used in the inverse synergy method for sm retrievals 3 4 metrics used for comparisons to compare the measured values of tb sm and the simulated retrieved values of tb sm four statistical criteria including coefficient of determination r2 the mean difference bias the root mean squared error rmse and the unbiased root mean squared error ubrmse were computed as follows 8 bias 1 n i 1 n s i m i r m s e 1 n i 1 n s i m i 2 u b r m s e r m s e 2 b i a s 2 r 2 1 n 1 i 1 n s i s œÉ s m i m œÉ m 2 where si is the ith simulated retrieved value mi is the ith measured value n is the total number of observations œÉs and œÉm are the standard deviations and overbar of m and s are the mean of measured and simulated retrieved values respectively it should be noted that all the statistics metrics were computed on dates available in all the three data sets smap smos and in situ sm therefore the number of the data for these three datasets are identical the minimum and maximum number of days in which all three data sets were available are respectively 66 for pbo h2o buckleyflt station and 238 days for uscrn wolf point 29 ene station in the time period of this study from april 2015 to november 2016 3 5 time series analysis of smap smos vod the time series analysis over some selected sites have been used in a number of previous studies as an evaluation method albergel et al 2012 escorihuela and quintana segu√≠ 2016 konings et al 2016 in order to get a better understanding of the results we analyzed the time series of vod and insitu soil moisture over a few stations to do so we randomly selected four stations out of 180 stations table 2 4 results and discussion in the following sections the obtained results are presented in section 3 1 the results of tb simulations and in section 3 2 the results of sm retrievals are presented in section 3 3 the results of temporal variations in vod as well as insitu sm over the four selected stations are explained 4 1 tb simulations 4 1 1 simulated tbv vs tbh fig 3 shows the value of r2 and ubrmse between the simulated tb by using in situ sm and measured smap tb all required parameters for the simulation process excluding sm which was obtained from ismn were considered the same as those used in the current operational smap level 2 algorithm horizontally polarized tb data are traditionally used due to their sensitivity to soil moisture o neill et al 2015 however it is worth noting that in comparison to tbh observations simulated tbv showed higher r2 and lower ubrmse in this study to compare tbv and tbh the following conditions were considered r2 greater than 0 5 and ubrmse 10 k the results showed that out of 180 stations 81 stations showed ubrmse 10 k and 93 stations showed r2 greater than 0 5 at v polarization while 26 stations showed ubrmse 10 k and 58 stations showed r2 greater than 0 5 at h polarization it should be noted that the lower values of ubrmse may be due to lower range of tbv values compared to the range of tbh values however we found better results for tbv in terms of both r2 and ubrmse this finding is in good agreement with those found in the literature miernecki et al 2014 o neill et al 2015 note that the large ubrmse values are not only related to the errors associated with the tb observations but also due to non representativity of point in situ sm input inaccurate vod input and other input parameters into the radiative transfer model wigneron et al 2017 4 1 2 results of tb simulations in the results given above the smap tb simulations were made using the vod values given in the smap algorithm and estimated from ndvi in this section we investigated whether the smap tb simulations could be improved using the synergy method i e using vod values retrieved from smos tb observations table 3 compares the number of stations where the synergy method improved the results in terms of r2 and ubrmse according to table 3 the use of 15 day moving average of smos vod in the forward model showed the better results in most stations improved results were generally obtained at the v polarization therefore hereafter we focus on this configuration sca v based on 15 day moving average of smos vod for further analysis of the results fig 4 shows the values of r2 and ubrmse between the measured tbv by smap and the simulated tbv by the synergy method over 180 stations the maximum and minimum values are respectively 0 92 0 06 for r2 and 20 29 k 2 62 k for ubrmse the improvements in terms of r2 and ubrmse due to employing the synergy method are presented in fig 5 out of 180 stations located in arid regions of the world both r2 and ubrmse values increased in 144 stations 0 01 r2 improvement 0 33 and 0 01 ubrmse improvement 12 kelvin while no improvement was observed in 9 stations furthermore 171 stations showed improvement in at least one of the two metrics of r2 or ubrmse fig 5 the maximum and minimum values of improvement in terms of ubrmse were respectively found in snotel and pbo h2o networks table 4 compares the predominant land cover classes of the improved and unimproved stations this comparison shows that the synergy method gives the better results over grasslands improvement in 85 percent of the grassland stations compared to the other land covers the l band emission of grasslands is complex as it is a combination of the emitted radiation of soil litter and the grass itself saleh et al 2007 the l meb model takes into account numerous effects such as standing vegetation litter and intercepted water by the vegetation canopy wigneron et al 2007 therefore these different effects may explain why the use of smos vod in the synergy method leads to improved results in grasslands 4 2 results of sm retrievals results of the inverse synergy method over all 180 stations showed that by using the sca v based on 15 day moving average of smos vod the accuracy of sm retrievals was improved in terms of r2 ubrmse and both metrics over 141 139 and 124 stations out of a total of 180 stations respectively fig 6 shows the amount of accuracy improvement in terms of r2 and ubrmse due to using the synergy method fig 7 presents the comparison of the retrieved sm products by using the synergy method smap sm products and smos sm products the median and mean value of statistical metrics over a large number of sites has been used in the literature to compare the various products albergel et al 2012 fernandez moran et al 2017b in this study the mentioned tree products were evaluated against in situ measurements over 180 stations in terms of median and mean r2 rmse absolute bias and ubrmse the results indicated that the synergy products led to higher median and mean value for r2 and lower median and mean values for rmse absolute bias and ubrmse in comparison with the other products the poorest results were obtained for the smos sm products probably due to the rfi contamination of smos products or to issues linked to the modeling of heterogeneous pixels in the smos l3 algorithm fernandez moran et al 2017a 4 3 time series analysis of vods the comparison between the temporal variations in insitu soil moisture and smos smap vod is presented in fig 8 over the four randomly selected sites presented in section 3 5 generally the trend of the smap vod is in good agreement with the seasonal behavior of vegetation the smap vod is linked to biomass and increases in summer as the biomass increases as can be seen in fig 8 the smap vod shows an increase from spring until summer during the crop growth phase and a decrease in fall and winter the maximum values can be seen from june to september which corresponds to the growing season of vegetation and the maximum amount of water per unit of ground area is contained within the vegetation however the smap vod time series are very smooth and do not show weekly or monthly variations in the vegetation biomass especially over panther station fig 8d fig 8 shows that the smos vod is a more dynamic parameter than the smap vod and that it is more consistent with the in situ sm temporal variations since the predominant land cover of three of the stations is grassland table 4 it is expected that temporal variations in soil moisture rapidly affect the grasslands and herbaceous plants this effect can be seen in the smos vod time series while the smap vod time series are relatievly smooth and only show the general seasonal pattern of vegetation in addition there is one smos vod peak over the three stations where the predominant landcover is grassland from march to june which can not be seen in the smap vod star signs in fig 8 a b c also there is a high peak in sm due to precipitation in winter plus signs in fig 8 the lag time between this peak value in winter and the high values of smos vod in spring is a result of the delay time in the begining of the growing season therefore we may assume that the smos vod can better show the variations in the biomass of grasses and herbaceous plants and their behavior during the growing season however the variability of the smos vod appears very high with several peaks throughout the year compared to what can be expected from typical vegetation phenology one possible interpretation of the low sensivity of the smap vod to the starting season of grasses is that smap vod is a function of vwc calculated from ndvi as discussed in the introduction section ndvi is not a good indicator of the vegetation status in arid regions due to the strong effects of the reflectance from the background soil it is worth noting that there is a good agreement between the in situ sm and smos vod over the panther station fig 8 d where the predominant landcover is open shrubland while smap vod does not show any considerable agreement in addition a 1 3 days lag time can be seen between high recorded values of insitu sm vertical lines in fig 8 d and smos vod this lag time may be due to the delay in water absorbed by the shrubs therefore we may assume that smos vod is also a good indicator of the impact of sm variations on the vegetation water content over shrublands for more accurate and precise conclusion future work will investigte this research topic based on ground biomass observations the results of the tb simulations as well as the temporal variations in sm vod emphasized that smos vod may be a better indicator of the vegetation status in comparison to the smap vod therefore the synergy method can be considered as a potential method for sm retrievals table 5 shows the values of r2 rmse bias and ubrmse between the in situ and retrieved sm and also between the measured and simulated tb over the 4 selected sites note that all the comparisons yielded p values 0 indicating the high statistical significance of the results given in terms of correlation to make the results of the inverse and forward model comparable the results of sca v are shown in table 5 these results showed that the synergy method could improve the sm retrievals as well 0 01 r2 improvement 0 035 and 0 ubrmse improvement 0 002 k however the results of the sm retrievals over three stations wagonmound cper and disaster peak did not fulfill the typical target accuracy of the smap and smos missions 0 04 m3 m3 5 conclusion a possible synergy approach based on vod between the smos and smap algorithms was exploited here to improve the smap tb simulations and sm retrievals the results indicated that the synergy method improved the results of smap tb simulations and sm retrievals respectively over 144 and 124 stations out of a total of 180 stations in terms of r2 and ubrmse values this improvement can be related to the advantages of the l meb inversion method this method avoids the empirical estimation of vod from ndvi and takes into account the effects of standing vegetation polarization incidence angle litter and rainfall and it is not dependent on the land cover in addition the comparison of the retrieved sm products by using the synergy method smap sm products and smos sm products indicated that the synergy products led to higher median and mean value for r2 and lower values for rmse and ubrmse in comparison with the other products furthermore the analysis of the temporal variations in vod suggested that the smos vod conversely to the smap vod may better capture the time variations in the cover fraction of the herbaceous plants the smap vod is a function of vwc which is estimated by using ndvi as discussed in the introduction section ndvi is not a good indicator of the vegetation biomass especially in the arid regions consequently smap vod did not seem to be a reliable source of information about the biomass of herbaceous plants and could not well discern its time variations we also found a good agreement between the time variations in the in situ sm and smos vod especially over a station with shrubland vegetation fig 8 d however the high variability of the smos vod showed that it is relatively noisy and it should be averaged using a sliding window method optimal time period 15 days these findings lead us to the overall conclusion that the synergy method is interesting for smap tb simulations and sm retrievals however there remains much room for improvement and several issues are still to be addressed these preliminary results were obtained over arid sites and a larger extent evaluation is required before any decisive conclusion could be drawn the mismatch between the footprint of smap smos and other input parameters to the model is an important issue that ought to be considered in future analyses furthermore it should be noted that comparing point scale ismn soil moisture measurements with large footprint of satellite products propagate uncertainty into the retrieval algorithm future researches should extend this work to global scale by using more sites across the world and using the improved smos ic vod data set fernandez moran et al 2017a in the latter data set issues associated with the modeling of heterogeneous pixels in the smos l3 algorithm have been solved the proposed synergy method of this paper should be tested in the most representative core validation

7523,aquifer salinization has recently increased significantly due to human activity and has caused irreparable environmental and economic effects in this research a new method is proposed for modeling the vulnerability to salinity for the ghaemshahr juybar aquifer specifically the galdit sea water intrusion and tawlbic saltwater up coning indices were combined to produce a map of vulnerability comprehensive salinity index or csi to seawater intrusion of a region near the coast and saltwater up coning away from the coast respectively single parameter and removal layer sensitivity analysis were performed in order to identify the sensitive parameters and achieve optimal weights through the single parameter method of contributing factors in all three methods the three optimized methods produced were galdit opt tawlbic opt and csi opt to assess the accuracy of the original maps and optimal ones the pearson correlation was used results indicated that the pearson correlation of the optimized galdit tawlbic and csi model was better than galdit tawlbic and csi the results show that the increase in correlation between ec electrical conductivity tds total dissolved solids and sar sodium adsorption ratio from the galdit model to the csi opt model from values of 0 64 0 56 and 0 68 has improved to values of 0 81 0 88 and 0 91 respectively the highest concentration of ec with a value of 7050 ¬µs cm is sampled in the areas of the east and northwest of the ghaemshahr juybar aquifer which are classified in the csi opt model as high and very high vulnerability levels the highest concentration of tds and sar has been found in the east northwest and northeast of the ghaemshahr juybar aquifer with a value of 4724 ppm for tds and 14 mg l for sar that have been modeled in the csi opt index as highly vulnerable areas eventually csi mapping can be used as an efficient tool in prioritizing in terms of the vulnerability to aquifer salinity

complicated and may be ignored for parameterization and laboratory simulation of groundwater salinity bear and dagan 1964 diersch and prochnow 1984 bower et al 1999 paster and dagan 2008 werner 2010 werner et al 2012 jakovovic et al 2012 morgan and werner 2015 shen et al 2015 however the laboratory approaches are very useful for a basic understanding and conceptualization of the salinity process including seawater intrusion and saltwater up coning e g werner 2010 werner et al 2012 morgan and werner 2015 jakovovic et al 2016 2012 2011 although the monitoring and evaluation of the intrinsic properties of the aquifer on a laboratory scale do not cover all of the conditions of aquifer salinity mechanism and generally require huge budgets werner 2010 jakovovic et al 2016 as a result this issue has led to the development of index based methods in plain scale werner et al 2009 werner 2010 in fact combined laboratory and indicator based methods can be used in order to manage groundwater resources and prioritize areas where vulnerability to salinity is high groundwater quality assessment is important for the planning and sustainable utilization of groundwater resources at aquifer scale kim et al 2014 tziritis et al 2014 brindha and elango 2015 field and gis based approaches were widely implemented after the concept of laboratory methods e g chachadi and lobo ferreira 2001

vulnerability of intrusion of seawater most of the research has been done using the field and indicator based approach chachadi et al 2001 chachadi and lobo ferreira 2001 paulo et al 2007 gholami et al 2010 tomaszkiewicz et al 2014 pedreira et al 2015 suhartono et al 2015 baalousha 2016 allouche et al 2017 however in the field of spatial modeling the vulnerability to saltwater up coning no research has been provided in aquifer scale the main aim of this study is the investigation of these processes for a comprehensive approach of aquifer vulnerability due to salinity performed in plain scale 2 materials and methods 2 1 the study area the qaemshahr juybar plain aquifer is located between east longitude 52 39 49 to 52 57 47 and north latitude 36 26 34 to 36 44 15 with an area of 787 km2 in the mazandaran province of iran fig 2 the average annual rainfall is 713 mm mrwa 2012 the geology of the study area is known as babol and ghaemshahr sheet at 1 100 000 based on a gsi 1997 95 of the study area is located in qcp rock unit including coastal plain deposits consisting of well sorted gravel and sand containing shell fragments the number of wells in this region is 27 485 84 and 14 of which relate to agriculture and drinking respectively the remaining 2 belongs to industry and fish farming fig 3 a in fig 3b 50 of the wells have been drilled between the years 1980 1990 in addition nearly 30 of them have been dug between the years 1990 2000 2 2 methodology a flowchart of the procedure is given in fig 4 which includes 5 sections fig 5 1 collecting information and data

analyzing the spatial distribution of the well s quality 5 accuracy assessment of tawlbic galdit and csi model with ec tds sar 2 3 data source information and dataset as input for modeling of vulnerability to salinity were collected from observation wells pumping wells and general wells of the mazandaran regional water company and were used to develop maps to evaluate the aquifer salinity mrwa 2012 piezometers tests located within the aquifer water table and qualitative statistics piezometer wells were provided by the mazandaran regional water authority mrwa 2012 the results of geophysical studies and electrical sounding to determine the thickness of aquifer in various parts of the aquifer and hydrodynamic coefficients including coefficient storage pumping test and transmissivity were collected by the exploration and exploitation of the wells of the mazandaran regional water company mrwa 2012 data source of the ghaemshahr juybar plain are shown in table 1 2 4 saltwater up coning vulnerability mapping tawlbic the tawlbic saltwater up coning vulnerability mapping model is used in order to provide a method for mapping saltwater up coning over the aquifer aquifer vulnerability assessment using tawlbic to get complex information of hydrogeological groundwater saltwater up coning is in the form of practical maps in order to make decisions and policies of water resources management vives et al 2005 bobba 2012 chandio and lee 2012 werner et al 2013 morgan and werner 2015 klassen and allen 2017 the tawlbic like the other indicator based methods of aquifer vulnerability uses multiple layers for tawlbic mapping eq 1 the tawlbic is derived from the seven initials based on hydrogeological factors that determine the physical and chemical properties referring to the vulnerability of groundwater aquifers these properties are type of aquifer t aquifer hydraulic conductivity a well density w groundwater levels decline l bedrock topography b impact

changed in the range of 1 10 and the subscript w indicates the weight of each factor quantifying their importance to the other factors which can be changed from 1 to 5 table 2 each aquifer property involved in eq 1 is described in the following 2 5 type of aquifer aquifers can be divided into three categories confined unconfined and leaky confined table 2 as confined aquifers have a bigger cone of depression than unconfined aquifers during pumping they are more vulnerable to salt water up coning werner et al 2009 information relating to the type of aquifer was obtained from geophysical studies marwa 2012 fig 7a 2 6 aquifer hydraulic conductivity the high hydraulic conductivity of aquifer caused a wider cone of depression level during the procedure of pumping and as a result it increases the potential for the mechanism of saltwater up coning scibek et al 2007 petalas et al 2009 chandio and lee 2012 jakovovic et al 2016 further restrictions on aquifer hydraulic conductivity are due to the decrease of vulnerability to saltwater up coning bobba 2012 jakovovic et al 2012 hydraulic conductivity is achieved by geoelectrical studies and pumping tests and it can also be obtained by dividing transmissivity per aquifer thickness fig 7b 2 7 well density for agricultural watershed one of the most important factors of saltwater up coning are the indiscriminate exploitation of wells zhou et al 2005 klassen and allen 2017 in fact the main source in the mechanism of aquifer salinity are the spatial distribution of wells and the consequent overuse of them klassen and allen 2017 thus the higher density of wells indicates the greater use of these wells resources and thus shows the higher likelihood of the saltwater up coning process the well density map was calculated using wells distribution operation and gis tools point density fig 7c 2 8 groundwater levels decline the overexploitation of groundwater resources has led to a decrease in the level of groundwater when the groundwater level drops water quality will also decrease allen and suchy 2001 in alluvial and coastal aquifers the saltwater can penetrate into fresh water in this case the saltwater may rise and enter the pumping well based on eq 1 this phenomenon is called up coning diersch and prochnow 1984 paster and dagan 2008 werner et al 2012 which is calculated according to the ghyben 1888 and herzberg 1901 equation 1 h s œÅ f œÅ s œÅ f h f h s œÅ f Œ¥ œÅ 1000 1025 1000 h s 40 h f where œÅs is the density of saltwater œÅf the density of fresh water hf the height of the fresh water and hs the height of the saltwater considering that the saltwater density is 1025 gr per cubic centimeter and the fresh water density is 1000 gr per cubic centimeter overexploitation leads to a cone of depression and drives 40 m above the saltwater for a 1 m drop in the pumping well fig 6 shows groundwater fluctuations in the ghaemshahr juybar aquifers it also shows a negative trend in the groundwater level reduction in this aquifer according to the groundwater hydrograph the groundwater level decline layer can be obtained by the differentiation of the groundwater level in the aquifer rest period december 2004 and maximum exploitation of the aquifer august 2011 fig 6 this map can provide useful information on maximum water level drops in the ghaemshahr juybar aquifer for the preparation of this factor data from 26 piezometer wells of the mazandaran regional water company mrwa 2012 in the statistical period of 2004 2012 was used fig 7d 2 9 bedrock topography the problem of up coning of saltwater in a bedrock brine aquifer to the overlying in alluvial and coastal aquifer and salinity source of up coning is supplied from bed rock formation mixed with salt water ma et al 1997 zhou et al 2005 in fact the distance between the bedrock to the surface land is low which will make it more vulnerable due to saltwater up coning this map is the result of differentiation between the digital elevation model and the thickness of the aquifer chachadi and lobo ferreira 2001 misut and voss 2007 fig 7e 2 10 impact of the existing status of saltwater up coning this map is linked to chemical interactions and ion exchange as a result of the saltwater up coning which occurs throughout the aquifer the na cl ionic ratio was used in order to determine the impact of the existing status of saltwater up coning which has been mentioned in various studies of up coning joseph and perret 1967 maliva and missimer 2012 werner et al 2012 klassen and allen 2017 this map provides information relating to the qualitative network of 179 sampling well s locations mrwa 2012 which were used fig 7f 2 11 cross resistance a hybrid map is obtained by multiplying the thickness of the aquifer and specific resistivity the cross resistance is important in terms of hydrogeological items ponzini et al 1984 frohlich and kelly 1985 whenever cross resistance becomes higher it will increase the potential of fresh water aquifers knowing the amount of cross resistance in an aquifer can result in the proper assessment of the chemical quality of groundwater in cross resistance of less than 10 ohm2 saltwater and fine materials are available fig 7 g the specific resistance map was prepared through geoelectric studies mrwa 2012 2 12 sea water intrusion vulnerability mapping galdit sea water intrusion vulnerability mapping has been used in many countries around the world chachadi et al 2001 chachadi and lobo ferreira 2001 weitz and demlie 2014 pedreira et al 2015 recinos et al 2015 askri 2015 singaraja et al 2015 suhartono et al 2015 baalousha 2016 bouderbala et al 2016 kardan moghaddam et al 2017 allouche et al 2017 the galdit abbreviation of six hydrogeological factors determines the aquifer vulnerability to seawater intrusion chachadi and lobo ferreira 2001 these factors include groundwater occurrence aquifer hydraulic conductivity depth to groundwater level distance from the shore impact of the existing status of seawater intrusion and thickness of the aquifer table 2 2 galdit index g r g w a r a w l r l w d r d w i r i w t r t w where r refers to the rating curve value which can be changed in the range of 1 10 w is the weight of each factor which indicates their importance to the other factors which can be changed from 1 to 5 table 2 2 13 preparing a comprehensive index of salinity human intervention such as agricultural and industrial activities in the coastal hydrological systems leads to the contamination of groundwater aquifers with salt javadi et al 2011 werner et al 2013 zghibi et al 2016 jafari et al 2016 therefore a comprehensive assessment of aquifer vulnerability to salinity is essential to implement programs to protect the quality of groundwater resources throughout the aquifers chenini et al 2015 werner 2010 for the purpose of this study galdit and tawlbic indicators will be integrated to provide a comprehensive index of salinity assessment allouche et al 2017 eq 3 3 csi t r t w a r a w w r w w l r l w b r b w i r i w c r c w l r l w d r d w i r i w where csi is the comprehensive salinity index 2 14 sensitivity analysis groundwater vulnerability may be obtained without using all parameters barber et al 1993 also the weights and rates given are not sufficiently accurate due to the uncertainties associated with each factor and the specific conditions of each aquifer in groundwater vulnerability analysis napolitano and fabbri 1996 sensitivity analysis can be implemented in order to understand better the effective factors in aquifer vulnerability and identify the effect of each factors on aquifer vulnerability brindha and elango 2015 it is also possible to determine the optimization of weights of effective factors according to the unique conditions of each aquifer in order to improve the accuracy of the vulnerability map two methods of sensitivity analysis of vulnerability to salinity have been investigated and implemented 2 15 simple parameter sensitivity analysis in this method the effective weight of each parameter is compared with its theoretical weight according to the following equation napolitano and fabbri 1996 kazakis and voudouris 2015 4 w p r p w v 100 in this equation w is the effective weight of each parameters pr and pw are the weight and the rate associated with each parameter respectively and v is the overall vulnerability index 2 16 layer removal sensitivity analysis in this method the variation of the vulnerability index is determined by the elimination of one or more participants according to the following equation lodwick et al 1990 brindha and elango 2015 5 s v n v n v 100 in this equation is the sensitivity rate v and v are modified and initial vulnerability indexes n and n are the number of layers used to calculate v and v initial vulnerability index is determined using all parameters and the modified vulnerability index is determined by a smaller number of parameters 3 results and discussion in this section the results of modeling to salinity mechanisms are analyzed and evaluated 3 1 tawlbic model the tawlbic model was applied for producing up coning saltwater mapping in the ghaemshahr juybar plain the classification tawlbic parameters are shown in table 2 factors related to the tawlbic method can be seen in fig 7 the results of this method are provided in fig 9 the type of groundwater indicated that the ghaemshahr juybar aquifer is known by three types of aquifer an unconfined one with an area of 459 7 km2 57 8 a confined one with areas of 277 3 km2 34 5 and a leaky confined aquifer with an area of 65 42 km2 8 2 which are in the range of 8 9 and 7 respectively table 2 most of the ghaemshahr juybar plain is related to unconfined aquifer which contains sand and gravel the confined aquifer is located between the unconfined aquifer region and includes clay and sandy clay with fine gravel the leaky confined aquifer is located in the north of the plain and in the vicinity of the sea that consists of clay sand and sandy clay the maximum and minimum values of hydraulic conductivity obtained in parts of the southwestern and eastern plain were 0 6 43 m d respectively also the weighted average hydraulic conductivity of the ghaemshahr juybar plain is 7 5 m d the density of wells drilled in the ghaemshahr juybar plain increases in locations farther from the shore the density of the wells within 15 25 km of the coast are maximized in this mentioned plain fig 8 a the density of the wells was divided into 5 classes and rated as 1 9 table 2 the maximum and minimum groundwater level decline fluctuated between 2004 and 2011 from 0 5 m to 6 3 m the groundwater level decline map was divided into 5 classes and rated as 1 9 table 2 the highest rate 9 has been allocated to the highest groundwater level decline 4 5 6 3 m the value of bedrock topography was categorized into 5 classes with a rating of 1 9 the minimum value of bedrock level is located in the east and southeast areas of the plain also most of the bedrock wells are between 30 and 100 m fig 8b the highest rate of bedrock level is between 23 and 40 because whenever the distance within the bedrock level is lesser increase in the vulnerability of saltwater up coning becomes greater zhou et al 2005 the ratio of ionic na cl is considered in order to determine the impact of the existing status of saltwater up coning jakovovic et al 2012 saltwater up coning occurs when indiscriminate harvesting causes the reduction of fresh water pressure ahead of saltwater bower et al 1999 this leads to ion exchange and handling of chlorine with sodium and calcium werner et al 2009 jakovovic et al 2011 due to the high chloride participation in the salinity process a low ratio of na cl is indicative of higher influences of saltwater up coning cross resistance values of the plain were divided into 5 classes with a rating of 1 9 low values of cross resistance indicate the high mineral and saltwater in groundwater reservoir and the highest values represent a high potential of water quality the maximum and minimum values of cross resistance obtained in parts of the south and east of the plain were 9500 and 8 1 ohm2 respectively also from the center of the plain towards the northeast of it the value of cross resistance reduces the map produced using the tawlbic model is shown in fig 9 the scope of a tawlbic vulnerability index number is between 53 and 154 table 3 provides a classification of the tawlbic vulnerability index based on the results most of the investigated area was assigned to a low class with 47 3 in addition only a small area of classes corresponded to a very high vulnerability class being an area of 4052 ha 5 06 additionally very low moderate and high classes covered 3848 6 ha 4 8 22940 5 ha 28 6 and 11364 1 ha 14 2 of the ghaemshahr juybar plain respectively fig 9 results showed that vulnerable areas to saltwater up coning are located in the east southeast and northwest of the plain respectively according to the tawlbic model 3194 and 6303 wells 11 6 and 22 9 of the total wells in the ghaemshahr juybar plain are in danger of saltwater up coning the 7516 wells located in the moderate class of up coning possibly vulnerable to exploitation may therefore increase the number of wells at risk of saltwater up coning in the future 3 2 galdit model maps of the required galdit method are shown in fig 10 two factors including the type of aquifer g or t and hydraulic conductivity a are similar in both the galdit and tawlbic methods the depth of the groundwater level map was divided into 5 classes and the weighted average water table depth of groundwater level over the entire plain was calculated to be 4 6 m the values of distance from the coast according to recinos et al 2015 are classified into 4 classes with a rate of 3 9 the highest rate described areas have less than 2500 m distance from the coast and the lowest rate are related to areas located at a distance of 10 000 m from the coast the hco3 cl ionic ratio was investigated in order to survey the influence of seawater intrusion bouderbala et al 2016 recinos et al 2015 singaraja et al 2015 during the up coning process chloride has high effects on the process of salinity interaction and a low ratio of hco3 cl indicates more impact of seawater intrusion kura et al 2014a the highest and lowest rates are found in the northern and southwestern plains with values of 0 15 and 9 65 respectively aquifer thickness values were divided into two categories allouche et al 2017 the first class of acquifer thickness is 7 25 m and rated at 2 and the second class having an aquifer thickness of 25 m and a rate of 1 the lowest thickness of the aquifer is in the center towards the north of the areas in this way the galdit index shows that the classification of the ghaemshahr juybar aquifer vulnerability to seawater intrusion changed from very low to very high with values between 36 and 78 fig 11 in the north of the plains and near the coast 12 9700 ha of the selected area was classified in the very high range of sea water intrusion vulnerability also 1487 wells 5 5 of the total wells are very vulnerable to seawater intrusion based on the result of the galdit model very low low moderate high classes covers 18 14 348 ha 38 7 30 940 ha 12 5 10 049 ha and 18 7 9726 ha percent of the whole plain respectively low vulnerability is located in parts of the west and especially the south and southwest of the study area the range of medium and high vulnerability is determined from the central part of this area towards the north plains this region including 4063 high and 2363 very high wells should be protected in order to prevent seawater intrusion and be under more control in the future 3 3 comprehensive salinity index mapping in the ghaemshahr juybar plain the density of the wells at 15 25 km distance away from the coast is much more than that of the wells located near the coast as a result salinity consequences associated with indiscriminate exploitation in the whole plain are wider than areas placed near the coast in this study the main goal was to describe a new method for the modeling of vulnerability to saltwater up coning areas located away from the coast and at overall level plains in addition galdit is a suitable method for assessing salinity in areas near to the coast chachadi et al 2001 chachadi and lobo ferreira 2001 therefore the combination of two methods similar factors have been used once can provide a comprehensive salinity index csi in agricultural watershed fig 12 csi map as galdit and tawlbic methods were classified into 5 classes fig 12 in the case of csi model 7 6 6077 6 ha of the selected area was classified in the very high vulnerability class also high moderate low and very low vulnerability classes covered almost 26 4 21110 1 ha 25 3 20277 9 ha 27 3 21829 7 ha and 13 5 10802 1 ha of the study area respectively fig 12 additionally according to the combined map 4328 and 6720 15 7 and 24 5 of all wells in plain wells are classified in very high and high vulnerability classes vulnerable areas due to salinity have been designated to areas of the east north and northwest of the plains fig 12 the continuing exploitation causes salinization of 40 of the wells making them unusable for agricultural and drinking purposes it also jeopardizes the rice and citrus farming and in the future will cause water stress and water crisis in these areas chandio and lee 2012 qiu et al 2012 therefore it is necessary to implement protective balanced and harmonious policies in these areas table 4 provides a classification of the csi vulnerability index 4 results of sensitivity analysis 4 1 single parameter sensitivity analysis the results of this method are presented in table 5 according to table 5 in the galdit model depth to groundwater level factor with the average effective weight of 27 93 was determined as the most sensitive factor in sea water intrusion also the type of aquifer and distance from the coast were also determined by the mean effective weight of 23 13 and 17 64 as other sensitive parameters of the galdit model in the tawlbic method the most sensitive parameters were determined including cross resistance groundwater level decline and bedrock topography with mean effective weights of 20 72 19 24 and 18 22 respectively mean effective weights of three mentioned parameters are almost consistent with the theoretical weights associated with these factors the range of effective weight of the cross resistance groundwater level decline with values 45 35 and 45 11 is more than the other parameters in the csi method cross resistance groundwater level decline bedrock topography and wells density with mean effective weights of 16 38 15 57 14 45 and 11 75 were identified as the most sensitive parameters respectively 4 2 parameter removal method the results of this method are shown in table 6 in the galdit method the impact of the existing status of seawater intrusion hco3 cl was determined with an average of 6 83 percent as the most sensitive parameter the groundwater occurrence and depth of groundwater level were identified as other sensitive parameters of this model in the tawlbic model the cross resistance groundwater levels decline and well density were determined with mean weights of 1 59 1 45 and 1 28 as sensitive parameters in the csi model cross resistance groundwater levels decline and well density with average weights of 0 72 0 7 and 0 49 were considered as the most sensitive parameters in the csi method 4 3 prepare optimized vulnerability maps optimal vulnerability maps were prepared due to the optimal weights obtained by the single parameter sensitivity analysis table 5 fig 13 a c the results of the vulnerability classes to salinity are presented table 7 also the classes of initial maps are shown to compare two approaches table 7 the results of the comparison of the two approaches show that the percentage of high and very high levels of salinity in the optimized galdit model has increased by 4 5 and 3 respectively in the case of tawlbic increasing the area in high and very high salinity levels has risen to 3 4 and 1 8 respectively and in the case of csi this increase in high and very high salinity class has increased to 4 4 and 3 2 4 4 accuracy assessment in terms of index based approaches since the modeling of vulnerability is used from various factors with different dimensions it is necessary to compare and verify the composition of the proposed criteria chachadi et al 2001 javadi et al 2017 2011 one of the accuracy assessments of indicators of vulnerability is the pearson correlation between the concentration of water quality parameters and calculating the indices allouche et al 2017 kura et al 2014a tramontana et al 2015 reaching an accurate assessment of the galdit tawlbic csi and optimized maps of these models the pearson correlation of vulnerability indices and concentration on network quality of well s samples were used including electrical conductivity ec total dissolved solids tds and sodium adsorption ratio sar these three criteria are related to salinity of aquifers and have been used in different studies fig 14 a f ketata et al 2012 kim et al 2014 tomaszkiewicz et al 2014 turnadge and smerdon 2014 machiwal and jha 2015 mehdizadeh et al 2015 singaraja et al 2015 docheshmeh and asghari moghaddam 2016 bouderbala et al 2016 jahanshahi and zare 2016 najib et al 2016 zaidi et al 2016 the results obtained are presented in fig 14a f these results show that optimized approaches have more pearson correlation than the initial approaches of vulnerability to salinity the highest pearson correlations are obtained between ec tds and sar by a csi opt model with values of 0 81 0 88 and 0 91 respectively fig 14f and table 8 the pearson correlation of ec tds and sar with tawlbic opt and galdit opt obtained were 0 72 and 0 83 0 74 and 0 68 0 64 and 0 72 respectively table 8 also in theoretical approaches of vulnerability to salinity the highest pearson correlations are obtained between ec tds and sar by a csi model with values of 0 76 0 73 and 0 77 respectively overall it can be said that the pearson correlation of the optimized galdit tawlbic and csi model is better than the galdit tawlbic and csi original model the results show that the increase in correlation between tds ec and sar from the galdit model to the csi opt model from values of 0 64 0 56 and 0 68 has been improved to values of 0 81 0 88 and 0 91 respectively fig 15 another analysis was performed to investigate the relationship between the percentage of ec tds and sar and salinity levels of vulnerability indices fig 16 a c results showed that the csi opt tawlbic opt and galdit opt model identified more areas with high and very high vulnerability to salinity in comparison with csi tawlbic and galdit respectively it can be said that initial methods of aquifer vulnerability to salinity were underestimated this means that very low and low vulnerable classes in the initial methods would have had a larger share of the aquifer area kazakis and voudouris 2015 by optimizing the initial maps and comparing them with initial methods the accuracy of vulnerability maps to salinity has improved according to fig 17 a the highest concentration of ec with a value of 7050 ¬µs cm is sampled in the east and northwest areas having aquifers which are classified in the csi opt model as high and very high vulnerability levels the highest concentration of tds and sar has been found in the east and northwest of aquifers with a value of 4724 ppm for tds and 14 mg l for sar that have been modeled in the csi opt index as the very high vulnerable areas fig 17b and c the correlation between the samples was then established and the classes were derived from the csi opt vulnerability model according to fig 17 a c the results indicate the positive correlation between the concentration of ec tds and sar with optimized comprehensive vulnerability index classes 5 discussion coastal aquifer vulnerability assessment is one of the practical methods for preventing groundwater salinization and prioritizing areas of aquifer where the potential for contamination to salinity is high in this research a common method of galdit was used for the purpose of vulnerability of sea water intrusion the results of this method showed that this model can only simulate the vulnerability of the seawater intrusion in the coastline according to luoma et al 2017 the galdit method can be used on the coastline for vulnerability to sea water intrusion also gornitz et al 1994 used the cvi method to assess the vulnerability of sea level rising using geomorphologic features on the coastline hence this research has proposed a new approach called tawlbic by using the effective factors in increasing salt water up coning in coastal aquifers throughout the aquifer in fact vulnerability maps to salinity were developed in areas that are far from the coast not only the coastline and exposed to salinity to follow by using non similar parameters in galdit and tawlbic a comprehensive salinity index csi was prepared other different researches such as klassen and allen 2017 developed a map of saltwater intrusion swi using climate change related hazards sea levels rise storm surge and exploitation wells density on the island of british columbia canada the results showed that risk assessment maps are potentially useful tools for identifying areas vulnerable to swi also garc√≠a men√©ndez et al 2016 used historical and current records of piezometric levels and chloride concentrations to trace the development of the salinization of the aquifer and analyzed the spatial characterization of the seawater upconing process in a coastal mediterranean aquifer then the results of the sensitivity analysis napolitano and fabbri 1996 brindha and elango 2015 in the csi method showed that cross resistance groundwater level decline bedrock topography and wells density were determined as sensitive factors it can be stated that the salinity mechanism is an outcome of the inherent susceptibility gurdak 2008 and anthropogenic overpumping klassen and allen 2017 vulnerability to salinity therefore by considering both approaches a comprehensive assessment can be presented of the vulnerability of salinity in coastal aquifers finally it is recommended to use the csi opt model and compare it with the swi model klassen and allen 2017 for vulnerability assessment of coastal aquifer to salinity in order to the validate this method it is also suggested that the effects of climate change luoma et al 2017 be integrated with a csi opt in a coastal aquifer it should be noted that there is no general vulnerability model to assess the vulnerability of all coastal or alluvial aquifers as the conditions of each aquifer are unique by analyzing the sensitivity of the effective parameters in the vulnerability there can be a better understanding of the aquifer behavior on the salinity process 6 conclusion identifying and determining aquifer salinization and vulnerability to salinity is one of the most important steps towards making appropriate decisions and prioritizing policies on groundwater resource management the aims of the present study are achieving a comprehensive map of vulnerability due to salinity to achieve this purpose the modeling of vulnerability to saltwater up coning was performed with the developement of a new tawlbic method the modeling of vulnerability to seawater intrusion was prepared by the galdit method after which by combining two indicators of seawater intrusion and saltwater up coning a comprehensive salinity index can be achieved single parameter and removal layer sensitivity analysis were performed in order to identify sensitive parameters and achieve optimal weights through the single parameter method of contributing factors in all three methods three optimized methods with the names galdit opt tawlbic opt and csi opt were produced to assess the accuracy of the original maps and optimal ones the pearson correlation was used result indicated that the pearson correlation of the optimized galdit tawlbic and csi model were better than the galdit tawlbic and csi the results show that the increase in correlation between tds ec and sar from the galdit model to the csi opt model from values of 0 64 0 56 and 0 68 has been improved to values of 0 81 0 88 and 0 91 respectively the highest concentration of ec with a value of 7050 ¬µs cm is sampled in the areas of the east and northwest aquifer which are classified in the csi opt model as high and very high vulnerability levels the highest concentration of tds and sar have been found in the east northwest and northeast aquifer with a value of 4724 ppm for tds and 14 mg

7523,aquifer salinization has recently increased significantly due to human activity and has caused irreparable environmental and economic effects in this research a new method is proposed for modeling the vulnerability to salinity for the ghaemshahr juybar aquifer specifically the galdit sea water intrusion and tawlbic saltwater up coning indices were combined to produce a map of vulnerability comprehensive salinity index or csi to seawater intrusion of a region near the coast and saltwater up coning away from the coast respectively single parameter and removal layer sensitivity analysis were performed in order to identify the sensitive parameters and achieve optimal weights through the single parameter method of contributing factors in all three methods the three optimized methods produced were galdit opt tawlbic opt and csi opt to assess the accuracy of the original maps and optimal ones the pearson correlation was used results indicated that the pearson correlation of the optimized galdit tawlbic and csi model was better than galdit tawlbic and csi the results show that the increase in correlation between ec electrical conductivity tds total dissolved solids and sar sodium adsorption ratio from the galdit model to the csi opt model from values of 0 64 0 56 and 0 68 has improved to values of 0 81 0 88 and 0 91 respectively the highest concentration of ec with a value of 7050 ¬µs cm is sampled in the areas of the east and northwest of the ghaemshahr juybar aquifer which are classified in the csi opt model as high and very high vulnerability levels the highest concentration of tds and sar has been found in the east northwest and northeast of the ghaemshahr juybar aquifer with a value of 4724 ppm for tds and 14 mg l for sar that have been modeled in the csi opt index as highly vulnerable areas eventually csi mapping can be used as an efficient tool in prioritizing in terms of the vulnerability to aquifer salinity carrying out adjustments recharge and adaptation policies for this issue keywords saltwater up coning seawater intrusion aquifer salinization groundwater management vulnerability optimization 1 introduction groundwater is considered as one of the most important water resources in the world gholami et al 2010 sherif et al 2012 neshat et al 2015 javadi et al 2017 in northern iran some of the well s consumption for agricultural industrial and drinking purposes are supplied from groundwater sources aquifer salinity has been identified as a major constraint for the use of water resources kura et al 2014a b gautam et al 2015 gholami et al 2016 gholami et al 2015a mastrocicco et al 2012 unauthorized and uncontrolled exploitation of groundwater resources and climate change sherif and singh 1996 sherif and singh 1999 von gunten et al 2015 luoma et al 2017 moller et al 2008 zhang et al 2012 has thereby reduced the amount of groundwater flow and has led to contaminated transports from sea to groundwater resources werner 2010 yu et al 2010 sefelnasr and sherif 2014 kura et al 2014b gholami et al 2015b arezoomand et al 2016 michael et al 2017 in addition solute transport and aquifer salinity is not limited to areas near the coast werner et al 2013 jakovovic et al 2016 the saltwater up coning process unlike seawater intrusion is not limited to the shores and occurs as a result of indiscriminate exploitation in all of the plains diersch and prochnow 1984 bower et al 1999 see fig 1 presumably the saltwater up coning process is much broader than the seawater intrusion understanding salinity mechanisms is extremely difficult and there are various scientific challenges to understanding the mechanisms of aquifer salinity werner et al 2009 2012 2013 in general laboratory and field work are two approaches that have been used for groundwater salinization modeling zhou et al 2005 bower et al 1999 bobba 2012 werner et al 2013 2012 jakovovic et al 2016 in some of the laboratory approaches analytical empirical and numerical solution some terms such as fluids immiscible vertical hydraulic conductivity porosity diffusion and transverse dispersivity are complicated and may be ignored for parameterization and laboratory simulation of groundwater salinity bear and dagan 1964 diersch and prochnow 1984 bower et al 1999 paster and dagan 2008 werner 2010 werner et al 2012 jakovovic et al 2012 morgan and werner 2015 shen et al 2015 however the laboratory approaches are very useful for a basic understanding and conceptualization of the salinity process including seawater intrusion and saltwater up coning e g werner 2010 werner et al 2012 morgan and werner 2015 jakovovic et al 2016 2012 2011 although the monitoring and evaluation of the intrinsic properties of the aquifer on a laboratory scale do not cover all of the conditions of aquifer salinity mechanism and generally require huge budgets werner 2010 jakovovic et al 2016 as a result this issue has led to the development of index based methods in plain scale werner et al 2009 werner 2010 in fact combined laboratory and indicator based methods can be used in order to manage groundwater resources and prioritize areas where vulnerability to salinity is high groundwater quality assessment is important for the planning and sustainable utilization of groundwater resources at aquifer scale kim et al 2014 tziritis et al 2014 brindha and elango 2015 field and gis based approaches were widely implemented after the concept of laboratory methods e g chachadi and lobo ferreira 2001

vulnerability of intrusion of seawater most of the research has been done using the field and indicator based approach chachadi et al 2001 chachadi and lobo ferreira 2001 paulo et al 2007 gholami et al 2010 tomaszkiewicz et al 2014 pedreira et al 2015 suhartono et al 2015 baalousha 2016 allouche et al 2017 however in the field of spatial modeling the vulnerability to saltwater up coning no research has been provided in aquifer scale the main aim of this study is the investigation of these processes for a comprehensive approach of aquifer vulnerability due to salinity performed in plain scale 2 materials and methods 2 1 the study area the qaemshahr juybar plain aquifer is located between east longitude 52 39 49 to 52 57 47 and north latitude 36 26 34 to 36 44 15 with an area of 787 km2 in the mazandaran province of iran fig 2 the average annual rainfall is 713 mm mrwa 2012 the geology of the study area is known as babol and ghaemshahr sheet at 1 100 000 based on a gsi 1997 95 of the study area is located in qcp rock unit including coastal plain deposits consisting of well sorted gravel and sand containing shell fragments the number of wells in this region is 27 485 84 and 14 of which relate to agriculture and drinking respectively the remaining 2 belongs to industry and fish farming fig 3 a in fig 3b 50 of the wells have been drilled between the years 1980 1990 in addition nearly 30 of them have been dug between the years 1990 2000 2 2 methodology a flowchart of the procedure is given in fig 4 which includes 5 sections fig 5 1 collecting information and data

vulnerability to salinity were collected from observation wells pumping wells and general wells of the mazandaran regional water company and were used to develop maps to evaluate the aquifer salinity mrwa 2012 piezometers tests located within the aquifer water table and qualitative statistics piezometer wells were provided by the mazandaran regional water authority mrwa 2012 the results of geophysical studies and electrical sounding to determine the thickness of aquifer in various parts of the aquifer and hydrodynamic coefficients including coefficient storage pumping test and transmissivity were collected by the exploration and exploitation of the wells of the mazandaran regional water company mrwa 2012 data source of the ghaemshahr juybar plain are shown in table 1 2 4 saltwater up coning vulnerability mapping tawlbic the tawlbic saltwater up coning vulnerability mapping model is used in order to provide a method for mapping saltwater up coning over the aquifer aquifer vulnerability assessment using tawlbic to get complex information of hydrogeological groundwater saltwater up coning is in the form of practical maps in order to make decisions and policies of water resources management vives et al 2005 bobba 2012 chandio and lee 2012 werner et al 2013 morgan and werner 2015 klassen and allen 2017 the tawlbic like the other indicator based methods of aquifer vulnerability uses multiple layers for tawlbic mapping eq 1 the tawlbic is derived from the seven initials based on hydrogeological factors that determine the physical and chemical properties referring to the vulnerability of groundwater aquifers these properties are type of aquifer t aquifer hydraulic conductivity a well density w groundwater levels decline l bedrock topography b impact of the existing status of salt water up coning i and cross resistance c 1 tawlbic index t r t w a r a w w r w w l r l w b r b w i r i w c r c w the subscript r identifies the rating value which can be changed in the range of 1 10 and the subscript w indicates the weight of each factor quantifying their importance to the other factors which can be changed from 1 to 5 table 2 each aquifer property involved in eq 1 is described in the following 2 5 type of aquifer aquifers can be divided into three categories confined unconfined and leaky confined table 2 as confined aquifers have a bigger cone of depression than unconfined aquifers during pumping they are more vulnerable to salt water up coning werner et al 2009 information relating to the type of aquifer was obtained from geophysical studies marwa 2012 fig 7a 2 6 aquifer hydraulic conductivity the high hydraulic conductivity of aquifer caused a wider cone of depression level during the procedure of pumping and as a result it increases the potential for the mechanism of saltwater up coning scibek et al 2007 petalas et al 2009 chandio and lee 2012 jakovovic et al 2016 further restrictions on aquifer hydraulic conductivity are due to the decrease of vulnerability to saltwater up coning bobba 2012 jakovovic et al 2012 hydraulic conductivity is achieved by geoelectrical studies and pumping tests and it can also be obtained by dividing transmissivity per aquifer thickness fig 7b 2 7 well density for agricultural watershed one of the most important factors of saltwater up coning are the indiscriminate exploitation of wells zhou et al 2005 klassen and allen 2017 in fact the main source in the mechanism of aquifer salinity are the spatial distribution of wells and the consequent overuse of them klassen and allen 2017 thus the higher density of wells indicates the greater use of these wells resources and thus shows the higher likelihood of the saltwater up coning process the well density map was calculated using wells distribution operation and gis tools point density fig 7c 2 8 groundwater levels decline the overexploitation of groundwater resources has led to a decrease in the level of groundwater when the groundwater level drops water quality will also decrease allen and suchy 2001 in alluvial and coastal aquifers the saltwater can penetrate into fresh water in this case the saltwater may rise and enter the pumping well based on eq 1 this phenomenon is called up coning diersch and prochnow 1984 paster and dagan 2008 werner et al 2012 which is calculated according to the ghyben 1888 and herzberg 1901 equation 1 h s œÅ f œÅ s œÅ f h f h s œÅ f Œ¥ œÅ 1000 1025 1000 h s 40 h f where œÅs is the density of saltwater œÅf the density of fresh water hf the height of the fresh water and hs the height of the saltwater considering that the saltwater density is 1025 gr per cubic centimeter and the fresh water density is 1000 gr per cubic centimeter overexploitation leads to a cone of depression and drives 40 m above the saltwater for a 1 m drop in the pumping well fig 6 shows groundwater fluctuations in the ghaemshahr juybar aquifers it also shows a negative trend in the groundwater level reduction in this aquifer according to the groundwater hydrograph the groundwater level decline layer can be obtained by the differentiation of the groundwater level in the aquifer rest period december 2004 and maximum exploitation of the aquifer august 2011 fig 6 this map can provide useful information on maximum water level drops in the ghaemshahr juybar aquifer for the preparation of this factor data from 26 piezometer wells of the mazandaran regional water company mrwa 2012 in the statistical period of 2004 2012 was used fig 7d 2 9 bedrock topography the problem of up coning of saltwater in a bedrock brine aquifer to the overlying in alluvial and coastal aquifer and salinity source of up coning is supplied from bed rock formation mixed with salt water ma et al 1997 zhou et al 2005 in fact the distance between the bedrock to the surface land is low which will make it more vulnerable due to saltwater up coning this map is the result of differentiation between the digital elevation model and the thickness of the aquifer chachadi and lobo ferreira 2001 misut and voss 2007 fig 7e 2 10 impact of the existing status of saltwater up coning this map is linked to chemical interactions and ion exchange as a result of the saltwater up coning which occurs throughout the aquifer the na cl ionic ratio was used in order to determine the impact of the existing status of saltwater up coning which has been mentioned in various studies of up coning joseph and perret 1967 maliva and missimer 2012 werner et al 2012 klassen and allen 2017 this map provides information relating to the qualitative network of 179 sampling well s locations mrwa 2012 which were used fig 7f 2 11 cross resistance a hybrid map is obtained by multiplying the thickness of the aquifer and specific resistivity the cross resistance is important in terms of hydrogeological items ponzini et al 1984 frohlich and kelly 1985 whenever cross resistance becomes higher it will increase the potential of fresh water aquifers knowing the amount of cross resistance in an aquifer can result in the proper assessment of the chemical quality of groundwater in cross resistance of less than 10 ohm2 saltwater and fine materials are available fig 7 g the specific resistance map was prepared through geoelectric studies mrwa 2012 2 12 sea water intrusion vulnerability mapping galdit sea water intrusion vulnerability mapping has been used in many countries around the world chachadi et al 2001 chachadi and lobo ferreira 2001 weitz and demlie 2014 pedreira et al 2015 recinos et al 2015 askri 2015 singaraja et al 2015 suhartono et al 2015 baalousha 2016 bouderbala et al 2016 kardan moghaddam et al 2017 allouche et al 2017 the galdit abbreviation of six hydrogeological factors determines the aquifer vulnerability to seawater intrusion chachadi and lobo ferreira 2001 these factors include groundwater occurrence aquifer hydraulic conductivity depth to groundwater level distance from the shore impact of the existing status of seawater intrusion and thickness of the aquifer table 2 2 galdit index g r g w a r a w l r l w d r d w i r i w t r t w where r refers to the rating curve value which can be changed in the range of 1 10 w is the weight of each factor which indicates their importance to the other factors which can be changed from 1 to 5 table 2 2 13 preparing a comprehensive index of salinity human intervention such as agricultural and industrial activities in the coastal hydrological systems leads to the contamination of groundwater aquifers with salt javadi et al 2011 werner et al 2013 zghibi et al 2016 jafari et al 2016 therefore a comprehensive assessment of aquifer vulnerability to salinity is essential to implement programs to protect the quality of groundwater resources throughout the aquifers chenini et al 2015 werner 2010 for the purpose of this study galdit and tawlbic indicators will be integrated to provide a comprehensive index of salinity assessment allouche et al 2017 eq 3 3 csi t r t w a r a w w r w w l r l w b r b w i r i w c r c w l r l w d r d w i r i w where csi is the comprehensive salinity index 2 14 sensitivity analysis groundwater vulnerability may be obtained without using all parameters barber et al 1993 also the weights and rates given are not sufficiently accurate due to the uncertainties associated with each factor and the specific conditions of each aquifer in groundwater vulnerability analysis napolitano and fabbri 1996 sensitivity analysis can be implemented in order to understand better the effective factors in aquifer vulnerability and identify the effect of each factors on aquifer vulnerability brindha and elango 2015 it is also possible to determine the optimization of weights of effective factors according to the unique conditions of each aquifer in order to improve the accuracy of the vulnerability map two methods of sensitivity analysis of vulnerability to salinity have been investigated and implemented 2 15 simple parameter sensitivity analysis in this method the effective weight of each parameter is compared with its theoretical weight according to the following equation napolitano and fabbri 1996 kazakis and voudouris 2015 4 w p r p w v 100 in this equation w is the effective weight of each parameters pr and pw are the weight and the rate associated with each parameter respectively and v is the overall vulnerability index 2 16 layer removal sensitivity analysis in this method the variation of the vulnerability index is determined by the elimination of one or more participants according to the following equation lodwick et al 1990 brindha and elango 2015 5 s v n v n v 100 in this equation is the sensitivity rate v and v are modified and initial vulnerability indexes n and n are the number of layers used to calculate v and v initial vulnerability index is determined using all parameters and the modified vulnerability index is determined by a smaller number of parameters 3 results and discussion in this section the results of modeling to salinity mechanisms are analyzed and evaluated 3 1 tawlbic model the tawlbic model was applied for producing up coning saltwater mapping in the ghaemshahr juybar plain the classification tawlbic parameters are shown in table 2 factors related to the tawlbic method can be seen in fig 7 the results of this method are provided in fig 9 the type of groundwater indicated that the ghaemshahr juybar aquifer is known by three types of aquifer an unconfined one with an area of 459 7 km2 57 8 a confined one with areas of 277 3 km2 34 5 and a leaky confined aquifer with an area of 65 42 km2 8 2 which are in the range of 8 9 and 7 respectively table 2 most of the ghaemshahr juybar plain is related to unconfined aquifer which contains sand and gravel the confined aquifer is located between the unconfined aquifer region and includes clay and sandy clay with fine gravel the leaky confined aquifer is located in the north of the plain and in the vicinity of the sea that consists of clay sand and sandy clay the maximum and minimum values of hydraulic conductivity obtained in parts of the southwestern and eastern plain were 0 6 43 m d respectively also the weighted average hydraulic conductivity of the ghaemshahr juybar plain is 7 5 m d the density of wells drilled in the ghaemshahr juybar plain increases in locations farther from the shore the density of the wells within 15 25 km of the coast are maximized in this mentioned plain fig 8 a the density of the wells was divided into 5 classes and rated as 1 9 table 2 the maximum and minimum groundwater level decline fluctuated between 2004 and 2011 from 0 5 m to 6 3 m the groundwater level decline map was divided into 5 classes and rated as 1 9 table 2 the highest rate 9 has been allocated to the highest groundwater level decline 4 5 6 3 m the value of bedrock topography was categorized into 5 classes with a rating of 1 9 the minimum value of bedrock level is located in the east and southeast areas of the plain also most of the bedrock wells are between 30 and 100 m fig 8b the highest rate of bedrock level is between 23 and 40 because whenever the distance within the bedrock level is lesser increase in the vulnerability of saltwater up coning becomes greater zhou et al 2005 the ratio of ionic na cl is considered in order to determine the impact of the existing status of saltwater up coning jakovovic et al 2012 saltwater up coning occurs when indiscriminate harvesting causes the reduction of fresh water pressure ahead of saltwater bower et al 1999 this leads to ion exchange and handling of chlorine with sodium and calcium werner et al 2009 jakovovic et al 2011 due to the high chloride participation in the salinity process a low ratio of na cl is indicative of higher influences of saltwater up coning cross resistance values of the plain were divided into 5 classes with a rating of 1 9 low values of cross resistance indicate the high mineral and saltwater in groundwater reservoir and the highest values represent a high potential of water quality the maximum and minimum values of cross resistance obtained in parts of the south and east of the plain were 9500 and 8 1 ohm2 respectively also from the center of the plain towards the northeast of it the value of cross resistance reduces the map produced using the tawlbic model is shown in fig 9 the scope of a tawlbic vulnerability index number is between 53 and 154 table 3 provides a classification of the tawlbic vulnerability index based on the results most of the investigated area was assigned to a low class with 47 3 in addition only a small area of classes corresponded to a very high vulnerability class being an area of 4052 ha 5 06 additionally very low moderate and high classes covered 3848 6 ha 4 8 22940 5 ha 28 6 and 11364 1 ha 14 2 of the ghaemshahr juybar plain respectively fig 9 results showed that vulnerable areas to saltwater up coning are located in the east southeast and northwest of the plain respectively according to the tawlbic model 3194 and 6303 wells 11 6 and 22 9 of the total wells in the ghaemshahr juybar plain are in danger of saltwater up coning the 7516 wells located in the moderate class of up coning possibly vulnerable to exploitation may therefore increase the number of wells at risk of saltwater up coning in the future 3 2 galdit model maps of the required galdit method are shown in fig 10 two factors including the type of aquifer g or t and hydraulic conductivity a are similar in both the galdit and tawlbic methods the depth of the groundwater level map was divided into 5 classes and the weighted average water table depth of groundwater level over the entire plain was calculated to be 4 6 m the values of distance from the coast according to recinos et al 2015 are classified into 4 classes with a rate of 3 9 the highest rate described areas have less than 2500 m distance from the coast and the lowest rate are related to areas located at a distance of 10 000 m from the coast the hco3 cl ionic ratio was investigated in order to survey the influence of seawater intrusion bouderbala et al 2016 recinos et al 2015 singaraja et al 2015 during the up coning process chloride has high effects on the process of salinity interaction and a low ratio of hco3 cl indicates more impact of seawater intrusion kura et al 2014a the highest and lowest rates are found in the northern and southwestern plains with values of 0 15 and 9 65 respectively aquifer thickness values were divided into two categories allouche et al 2017 the first class of acquifer thickness is 7 25 m and rated at 2 and the second class having an aquifer thickness of 25 m and a rate of 1 the lowest thickness of the aquifer is in the center towards the north of the areas in this way the galdit index shows that the classification of the ghaemshahr juybar aquifer vulnerability to seawater intrusion changed from very low to very high with values between 36 and 78 fig 11 in the north of the plains and near the coast 12 9700 ha of the selected area was classified in the very high range of sea water intrusion vulnerability also 1487 wells 5 5 of the total wells are very vulnerable to seawater intrusion based on the result of the galdit model very low low moderate high classes covers 18 14 348 ha 38 7 30 940 ha 12 5 10 049 ha and 18 7 9726 ha percent of the whole plain respectively low vulnerability is located in parts of the west and especially the south and southwest of the study area the range of medium and high vulnerability is determined from the central part of this area towards the north plains this region including 4063 high and 2363 very high wells should be protected in order to prevent seawater intrusion and be under more control in the future 3 3 comprehensive salinity index mapping in the ghaemshahr juybar plain the density of the wells at 15 25 km distance away from the coast is much more than that of the wells located near the coast as a result salinity consequences associated with indiscriminate exploitation in the whole plain are wider than areas placed near the coast in this study the main goal was to describe a new method for the modeling of vulnerability to saltwater up coning areas located away from the coast and at overall level plains in addition galdit is a suitable method for assessing salinity in areas near to the coast chachadi et al 2001 chachadi and lobo ferreira 2001 therefore the combination of two methods similar factors have been used once can provide a comprehensive salinity index csi in agricultural watershed fig 12 csi map as galdit and tawlbic methods were classified into 5 classes fig 12 in the case of csi model 7 6 6077 6 ha of the selected area was classified in the very high vulnerability class also high moderate low and very low vulnerability classes covered almost 26 4 21110 1 ha 25 3 20277 9 ha 27 3 21829 7 ha and 13 5 10802 1 ha of the study area respectively fig 12 additionally according to the combined map 4328 and 6720 15 7 and 24 5 of all wells in plain wells are classified in very high and high vulnerability classes vulnerable areas due to salinity have been designated to areas of the east north and northwest of the plains fig 12 the continuing exploitation causes salinization of 40 of the wells making them unusable for agricultural and drinking purposes it also jeopardizes the rice and citrus farming and in the future will cause water stress and water crisis in these areas chandio and lee 2012 qiu et al 2012 therefore it is necessary to implement protective balanced and harmonious policies in these areas table 4 provides a classification of the csi vulnerability index 4 results of sensitivity analysis 4 1 single parameter sensitivity analysis the results of this method are presented in table 5 according to table 5 in the galdit model depth to groundwater level factor with the average effective weight of 27 93 was determined as the most sensitive factor in sea water intrusion also the type of aquifer and distance from the coast were also determined by the mean effective weight of 23 13 and 17 64 as other sensitive parameters of the galdit model in the tawlbic method the most sensitive parameters were determined including cross resistance groundwater level decline and bedrock topography with mean effective weights of 20 72 19 24 and 18 22 respectively mean effective weights of three mentioned parameters are almost consistent with the theoretical weights associated with these factors the range of effective weight of the cross resistance groundwater level decline with values 45 35 and 45 11 is more than the other parameters in the csi method cross resistance groundwater level decline bedrock topography and wells density with mean effective weights of 16 38 15 57 14 45 and 11 75 were identified as the most sensitive parameters respectively 4 2 parameter removal method the results of this method are shown in table 6 in the galdit method the impact of the existing status of seawater intrusion hco3 cl was determined with an average of 6 83 percent as the most sensitive parameter the groundwater occurrence and depth of groundwater level were identified as other sensitive parameters of this model in the tawlbic model the cross resistance groundwater levels decline and well density were determined with mean weights of 1 59 1 45 and 1 28 as sensitive parameters in the csi model cross resistance groundwater levels decline and well density with average weights of 0 72 0 7 and 0 49 were considered as the most sensitive parameters in the csi method 4 3 prepare optimized vulnerability maps optimal vulnerability maps were prepared due to the optimal weights obtained by the single parameter sensitivity analysis table 5 fig 13 a c the results of the vulnerability classes to salinity are presented table 7 also the classes of initial maps are shown to compare two approaches table 7 the results of the comparison of the two approaches show that the percentage of high and very high levels of salinity in the optimized galdit model has increased by 4 5 and 3 respectively in the case of tawlbic increasing the area in high and very high salinity levels has risen to 3 4 and 1 8 respectively and in the case of csi this increase in high and very high salinity class has increased to 4 4 and 3 2 4 4 accuracy assessment in terms of index based approaches since the modeling of vulnerability is used from various factors with different dimensions it is necessary to compare and verify the composition of the proposed criteria chachadi et al 2001 javadi et al 2017 2011 one of the accuracy assessments of indicators of vulnerability is the pearson correlation between the concentration of water quality parameters and calculating the indices allouche et al 2017 kura et al 2014a tramontana et al 2015 reaching an accurate assessment of the galdit tawlbic csi and optimized maps of these models the pearson correlation of vulnerability indices and concentration on network quality of well s samples were used including electrical conductivity ec total dissolved solids tds and sodium adsorption ratio sar these three criteria are related to salinity of aquifers and have been used in different studies fig 14 a f ketata et al 2012 kim et al 2014 tomaszkiewicz et al 2014 turnadge and smerdon 2014 machiwal and jha 2015 mehdizadeh et al 2015 singaraja et al 2015 docheshmeh and asghari moghaddam 2016 bouderbala et al 2016 jahanshahi and zare 2016 najib et al 2016 zaidi et al 2016 the results obtained are presented in fig 14a f these results show that optimized approaches have more pearson correlation than the initial approaches of vulnerability to salinity the highest pearson correlations are obtained between ec tds and sar by a csi opt model with values of 0 81 0 88 and 0 91 respectively fig 14f and table 8 the pearson correlation of ec tds and sar with tawlbic opt and galdit opt obtained were 0 72 and 0 83 0 74 and 0 68 0 64 and 0 72 respectively table 8 also in theoretical approaches of vulnerability to salinity the highest pearson correlations are obtained between ec tds and sar by a csi model with values of 0 76 0 73 and 0 77 respectively overall it can be said that the pearson correlation of the optimized galdit tawlbic and csi model is better than the galdit tawlbic and csi original model the results show that the increase in correlation between tds ec and sar from the galdit model to the csi opt model from values of 0 64 0 56 and 0 68 has been improved to values of 0 81 0 88 and 0 91 respectively fig 15 another analysis was performed to investigate the relationship between the percentage of ec tds and sar and salinity levels of vulnerability indices fig 16 a c results showed that the csi opt tawlbic opt and galdit opt model identified more areas with high and very high vulnerability to salinity in comparison with csi tawlbic and galdit respectively it can be said that initial methods of aquifer vulnerability to salinity were underestimated this means that very low and low vulnerable classes in the initial methods would have had a larger share of the aquifer area kazakis and voudouris 2015 by optimizing the initial maps and comparing them with initial methods the accuracy of vulnerability maps to salinity has improved according to fig 17 a the highest concentration of ec with a value of 7050 ¬µs cm is sampled in the east and northwest areas having aquifers which are classified in the csi opt model as high and very high vulnerability levels the highest concentration of tds and sar has been found in the east and northwest of aquifers with a value of 4724 ppm for tds and 14 mg l for sar that have been modeled in the csi opt index as the very high vulnerable areas fig 17b and c the correlation between the samples was then established and the classes were derived from the csi opt vulnerability model according to fig 17 a c the results indicate the positive correlation between the concentration of ec tds and sar with optimized comprehensive vulnerability index classes 5 discussion coastal aquifer vulnerability assessment is one of the practical methods for preventing groundwater salinization and prioritizing areas of aquifer where the potential for contamination to salinity is high in this research a common method of galdit was used for the purpose of vulnerability of sea water intrusion the results of this method showed that this model can only simulate the vulnerability of the seawater intrusion in the coastline according to luoma et al 2017 the galdit method can be used on the coastline for vulnerability to sea water intrusion also gornitz et al 1994 used the cvi method to assess the vulnerability of sea level rising using geomorphologic features on the coastline hence this research has proposed a new approach called tawlbic by using the effective factors in increasing salt water up coning in coastal aquifers throughout the aquifer in fact vulnerability maps to salinity were developed in areas that are far from the coast not only the coastline and exposed to salinity to follow by using non similar parameters in galdit and tawlbic a comprehensive salinity index csi was prepared other different researches such as klassen and allen 2017 developed a map of saltwater intrusion swi using climate change related hazards sea levels rise storm surge and exploitation wells density on the island of british columbia canada the results showed that risk assessment maps are potentially useful tools for identifying areas vulnerable to swi also garc√≠a men√©ndez et al 2016 used historical and current records of piezometric levels and chloride concentrations to trace the development of the salinization of the aquifer and analyzed the spatial characterization of the seawater upconing process in a coastal mediterranean aquifer then the results of the sensitivity analysis napolitano and fabbri 1996 brindha and elango 2015 in the csi method showed that cross resistance groundwater level decline bedrock topography and wells density were determined as sensitive factors it can be stated that the salinity mechanism is an outcome of the inherent susceptibility gurdak 2008 and anthropogenic overpumping klassen and allen 2017 vulnerability to salinity therefore by considering both approaches a comprehensive assessment can be presented of the vulnerability of salinity in coastal aquifers finally it is recommended to use the csi opt model and compare it with the swi model klassen and allen 2017 for vulnerability assessment of coastal aquifer to salinity in order to the validate this method it is also suggested that the effects of climate change luoma et al 2017 be integrated with a csi opt in a coastal aquifer it should be noted that there is no general vulnerability model to assess the vulnerability of all coastal or alluvial aquifers as the conditions of each aquifer are unique by analyzing the sensitivity of the effective parameters in the vulnerability there can be a better understanding of the aquifer behavior on the salinity process 6 conclusion identifying and determining aquifer salinization and vulnerability to salinity is one of the most important steps towards making appropriate decisions and prioritizing policies on groundwater resource management the aims of the present study are achieving a comprehensive map of vulnerability due to salinity to achieve this purpose the modeling of vulnerability to saltwater up coning was performed with the developement of a new tawlbic method the modeling of vulnerability to seawater intrusion was prepared by the galdit method after which by combining two indicators of seawater intrusion and saltwater up coning a comprehensive salinity index can be achieved single parameter and removal layer sensitivity analysis were performed in order to identify sensitive parameters and achieve optimal weights through the single parameter method of contributing factors in all three methods three optimized methods with the names galdit opt tawlbic opt and csi opt were produced to assess the accuracy of the original maps and optimal ones the pearson correlation was used result indicated that the pearson correlation of the optimized galdit tawlbic and csi model were better than the galdit tawlbic and csi the results show that the increase in correlation between tds ec and sar from the galdit model to the csi opt model from values of 0 64 0 56 and 0 68 has been improved to values of 0 81 0 88 and 0 91 respectively the highest concentration of ec with a value of 7050 ¬µs cm is sampled in the areas of the east and northwest aquifer which are classified in the csi opt model as high and very high vulnerability levels the highest concentration of tds and sar have been found in the east northwest and northeast aquifer with a value of 4724 ppm for tds and 14 mg l for sar that have been modeled in the csi opt index as the very high vulnerable areas this research creates an increase in accuracy by using a csi opt in the case of coastal aquifers vulnerability the csi opt method can be used as an efficient tool in harvest management and the prohibition of developing wells in vulnerable regions and can also prioritize items of the vulnerability of the coastal aquifer salinity carrying out adjustment recharge and adaptation policies regarding this issue acknowledgments the authors would like to thank dr vahid gholami for providing useful information regarding the study area finally the authors would like to show their appreciation to the unknown reviewer for their useful comments on this work 
7524,paleoclimate reconstructions are increasingly used to characterize annual climate variability prior to the instrumental record to improve estimates of climate extremes and to provide a baseline for climate change projections to date paleoclimate records have seen limited engineering use to estimate hydrologic risks because water systems models and managers usually require streamflow input at the monthly scale this study explores the hypothesis that monthly streamflows can be adequately modeled by statistically decomposing annual flow reconstructions to test this hypothesis a multiple linear regression model for monthly streamflow reconstruction is presented that expands the set of predictors to include annual streamflow reconstructions reconstructions of global circulation and potential differences among regional tree ring chronologies related to tree species and geographic location this approach is used to reconstruct 600 years of monthly streamflows at two sites on the bear and logan rivers in northern utah nash sutcliffe efficiencies remain above zero 0 26 0 60 for all months except april and pearson s correlation coefficients r are 0 94 and 0 88 for the bear and logan rivers respectively confirming that the model can adequately reproduce monthly flows during the reference period 10 1942 to 9 2015 incorporating a flexible transition between the previous and concurrent annual reconstructed flows was the most important factor for model skill expanding the model to include global climate indices and regional tree ring chronologies produced smaller but still significant improvements in model fit the model presented here is the only approach currently available to reconstruct monthly streamflows directly from tree ring chronologies and climate reconstructions rather than using resampling of the observed record with reasonable estimates of monthly flow that extend back in time many centuries water managers can challenge systems models with a larger range of natural variability in drought and pluvial events and better evaluate extreme events with recurrence intervals longer than the observed record establishing this natural baseline is critical when estimating future hydrologic risks under conditions of a non stationary climate keywords paleoclimate streamflow reconstruction tree ring global circulation dendrochronology 1 introduction while grappling with the question of how future climate changes will affect the likelihood and severity of hydrological extremes floods and droughts hydrologists engineers and water resources planners have noted the potential for streamflow reconstructions to characterize pre industrial hydrologic variability over multiple centuries bonin and burn 2005 by combining reconstructions of the past with climate change projections it may be possible to place the signal of climate change induced streamflow trends in the context of long term natural variability in addition streamflow reconstructions can significantly increase the number of scenarios used for drought vulnerability studies or water resources systems optimization despite these potential benefits streamflow reconstructions have not gained widespread use in water systems analysis in part because flow has typically been reconstructed at an annual resolution which is generally too coarse for analysis of drought vulnerability and decision making this study explores whether monthly streamflows can be adequately predicted from annual tree ring chronologies and other reconstructed data to confirm this we outline and test a novel statistical method to reconstruct monthly flow series existing techniques for annual streamflow reconstruction primarily rely on linear regression to relate carefully chosen tree ring chronologies to mean annual flow maf during the available instrumental record this relationship is then applied to the full tree ring record to reconstruct flows outside the observed period loaiciga et al 1993 cook and kairiukstis 2013 tree ring chronologies are carefully developed by selecting sites and species in which the reconstruction variable is the limiting factor for tree growth multiple replication samples are often taken for each tree and these measurements across many trees at a given site are combined to generate a master site ring width through a process called crossdating whereby common features in the chronology are matched fritts 2012 douglass 1941 the resulting chronologies can be linked to climate variables either through simple linear regression duvick and blasing 1981 multiple linear regression meko et al 1980 or more complex approaches more complex reconstruction approaches often rely on principal component analysis pca to extract differences commonalities across multiple site chronologies and tree species to better capture regional variations cook et al 1994 hidalgo et al 2000 maxwell et al 2011 or seasonal effects brubaker 1980 meko et al 2015 showed that flow reconstruction accuracy can be improved by using pca and regression to combine chronologies from traditional reconstruction species and less traditional species which capture unique climate signals reconstruction approaches assume that processes relating climate to tree ring growth during the instrumental record are identical to the reconstructed period fritts 2012 this principle of uniformatism has been slightly modified in modern dendrochronology to separate the important climate signal from underlying factors affecting tree growth cook 1987 uniformitism is particularly important for flow reconstructions where river reaches should be selected to avoid significant man made effects alternatively the effects of impoundments or land use change can be removed from the time series to approximate a near natural flow record annual streamflow recontructions have been produced for regions with adequate tree ring chronologies meko et al 2001 woodhouse et al 2006 and have been used for water resources planning e g woodhouse and lukas 2006 and axelson et al 2009 despite the availability of annual streamflow reconstructions few methodologies currently exist to reconstruct sub annual flow from annual resolved tree ring chronologies gangopadhyay et al 2015 sauchyn and ilich 2017 the sauchyn and ilich 2017 approach uses stochastic hydrology techniques to generate many feasible sequences of weekly flows that sum to the annual reconstruction while maintaining statistical properties of the observed record the gangopadhyay et al 2015 approach instead resamples annual subsets of temperature and precipitation from the instrumental records and matches them to tree ring widths in the paleo record using a k nearest neighbor approach repeated many times to develop an ensemble of temperature and precipitation timeseries gangopadhyay et al 2009 temperature and precipitation are then used as inputs for a water balance model wolock and mccabe 1999 this method has been used to generate seasonal streamflow in nevada solander et al 2010 and monthly streamflow along the colorado river gangopadhyay et al 2015 while useful for generating runoff in well studied watersheds this approach requires a calibrated watershed model that is not always available additionally by resampling from the observed record the potential monthly time series of temperature and precipitation are limited to re ordering 60 100 observed annual subsets from the instrumental record while this may be an effective approach for some locations it is highly desirable to develop methods to reconstruct monthly streamflow directly without the need for watershed models and the limitations of repeated resampling to test the hypothesis that monthly streamflow can be reconstructed from annual tree ring chronologies this study introduces a novel approach for reconstructing monthly streamflow that extends fundamental principles of flow reconstruction and then demonstrates these models by reconstructing flow and evaluating goodness of fit for two sites in northern utah the candidate models include a simple monthly fraction mf model an annual percentile ap model that directly links annual flow percentile with monthly percentile and an annual percentile with regression apr model that uses multiple annual reconstructions to predict the monthly percentile several versions of the apr model are considered each adding increasing predictors which include 1 the original annual streamflow reconstructions 2 climate reconstructions of the el ni√±o southern oscillation enso and 3 regionally available tree ring chronologies regional tree ring chronologies were included as predictors based on the hypothesis that different species elevations and site locations might capture different parts of the seasonal hydrologic signal whereas enso was considered because it has shown coherence with streamflow and precipitation in the western u s and utah cayan et al 1999 schoennagel et al 2005 wang et al 2012 deflorio et al 2013 zhou et al 2014 the paper further evaluates and discusses model results in the context of individual predictors their physical basis and implications for water management 2 models three model frameworks are introduced in this study as potential candidates for the reconstruction of mean monthly streamflow the mf model uses simplistic assumptions to reconstruct monthly streamflows and is included as a null model against which the other models can be compared the remaining two models constitute the primary approach proposed herein and are presented in order of increasing complexity each applying the same basic framework but with increasing numbers of predictors first the ap model directly links the reconstructed annual streamflow percentiles to monthly percentiles using the assumption that the monthly percentile is constant and identical to the reconstructed annual percentile throughout each water year second the apr model estimates monthly percentiles using regression first considering only lagged annual streamflow percentiles and ultimately incorporating additional predictors such as global climate indices enso or spatial species patterns in regional tree ring chronologies extracted by pca the models and fitting procedures are available as an r package paleoapr stagge 2017 while the code and data for the specific analyses performed in this paper are available in an online repository athttps doi org 10 5281 zenodo 1029739 2 1 monthly fraction mf model the mf model assumes that the monthly proportion of total annual streamflow taf is identical across all years based on this assumption the monthly fraction f m y is determined for each month by dividing the monthly flow volume q m a by annual volume taf y in this notation m and a subscripts correspond to monthly and annual steps respectively taf is equivalent to 12 maf monthly streamflow is then reconstructed by multiplying the appropriate mean monthly fraction f m for each of the 12 months by reconstructed taf 1 q m f m taf a where f m a 1 n f m y n and f m a q m a taf a where q m represents estimated monthly streamflow monthly flows reconstructed by the mf model retain the same seasonal shape but are scaled linearly for example if an average of 30 of each year s historical flow volume occurred during june this proportion is maintained in the reconstruction prior to performing reconstruction the 12 f m values were re scaled to sum to 1 to ensure monthly flows would recreate the original maf reconstruction the mean f m was used to represent the monthly fraction rather than the median which made little difference in the case study results 2 2 annual percentile ap model the ap model forms the base for all subsequent reconstruction models it assumes that the streamflow percentile for each month is equivalent to the maf percentile for the particular water year that is if a given year s maf is in the 20th percentile then the mean flow for each month of that water year was also the 20th percentile determined by the cumulative probability distribution of flow for each month because subsequent models depend on a gaussian distribution we transformed the percentile 0 100 to a standard normal value to represented by the variable n 2 n m n a where n m is the estimated monthly standard normal and the subscripts m and a again represent monthly and annual values of the normalized streamflow percentile for use in the ap model a univariate probability distribution was fit to the maf and each of the monthly mean flows to permit transformation to and from the standard normal distribution non parametric alternatives such as empirical cumulative distributions were not considered because they limit the ability to extrapolate beyond the original data annual and monthly cumulative distributions were fit based on maximum likelihood estimation mle using the fitdistrplus package in r delignette muller and dutang 2015 candidate distributions were visually compared using skewness kurtosis plots cullen and frey 1999 evaluated with 500 nonparametric bootstrap realizations final selection of candidate distributions was further validated based on akaike information criterion aic quantile plots and results of kolmogorov smirnov and anderson darling tests statistical distribution tests were based on 5000 bootstrap simulations thereby avoiding the issue of applying tests where parameters are estimated from the data crutcher 1975 2 3 annual percentile with regression apr model the apr model has the same fundamental structure as the ap model without enforcing a 1 1 relationship between the annual and monthly standard normal values instead a unique regression model for each month was fit which estimated that month s streamflow percentile based on a number of potential predictors this regression approaches uses similar principles as other multiple linear regression reconstructions meko et al 1980 cook et al 1994 hidalgo et al 2000 it is designed to be flexible so that in future studies any variable with a demonstrated climate effect could be considered as a predictor three apr models of increasing complexity are considered in this study the first uses only the standard normal of the lagged percentiles from the annual streamflow reconstruction 3 n m 0 Œ≤ 1 n a 1 Œ≤ 0 n a 0 Œ≤ 1 n 1 where n m 0 represents monthly standard normal as in eq 2 and n a 1 n a 0 and n a 1 are annual normalized percentiles for the previous concurrent and future water years respectively the associated Œ≤ values are model coefficients fit using the regression approach described below transformation to standard normal values rather than percentiles was done to permit regression with standard normal residuals the model described in eq 3 is referred to as the apr model with lagged predictors it can be viewed as a temporal disaggregation of the original annual reconstruction using no additional data the lagged regression approach alleviates the need to explicitly define the most appropriate water year bounds as it is naturally derived based on predictive power the second and third variants of the apr model incorporate predictors outside the original annual reconstruction the second model adds two reconstructions of the enso climate index while the third model adds regional tree ring principal components these are referred to as apr with climate indices and apr with all predictors respectively with the full apr with all predictors model taking the form 4 n m 0 Œ≤ 1 n a 1 Œ≤ 0 n a 0 Œ≤ 1 n 1 Œ≤ enso enso j 1 8 Œ≤ j pc j where additional predictors for enso and regional tree ring principal components are included as Œ≤ enso and Œ≤ j respectively 3 methods 3 1 mean annual reconstructions the candidate monthly reconstruction approaches were applied at two sites with previously published annual streamflow reconstructions in the bear river watershed of northern utah flows in this region are snowmelt dominated with the majority of annual precipitation falling in the form of winter snow the two sites were located on the logan river and in the upper bear river both reconstructions allen et al 2013 derose et al 2015 used similar methods to reconstruct the maf based on the usgs water year of oct sep the bear river is located in the intermountain u s and is the single largest river in the eastern great basin it drains portions of northeastern utah southwestern wyoming and southeastern idaho with its headwaters located in the uinta mountains the bear river is the largest tributary to the great salt lake providing approximately 60 of its annual inflow the annual flow reconstruction for the upper bear river is based on the instrumental flow record from usgs gauge 1011500 1942 ce present this gauge is located near the furthest upstream utah wyoming border and includes flow contribution from a 445 km2 watershed along the north slope of the uinta mountains flow at this site contributes approximately 8 of the total bear river flow flow at this site is considered near natural as it is upstream of major diversions with only a single small storage reservoir located upstream the tree ring predictor data used to reconstruct maf was based on a nearby utah juniper juniperus osteosperma chronology the reconstruction derose et al 2015 covered the period 800 2010 ce and explained 67 of annual variation r2 0 672 the logan river is the largest tributary to the bear river and drains 1389 km2 of the bear river range in northeastern utah and southeastern idaho the maf reconstruction allen et al 2013 is based on usgs gauge 10109001 1922 ce present which captures the near natural upper portion 554 km2 of the logan river watershed prior to impoundments and diversions near the city of logan utah the reconstruction covers the period from 1605 to 2010 ce two reconstruction models were used one termed the local model that relied on two rocky mountain juniper juniperus scopulorum chronologies located within the logan river watershed and another termed the regional model that also incorporated a two needle pinyon pinus edulis chronology from north central utah and a limber pine pinus flexilis chronology from western wyoming the regional model showed better skill r2 0 581 than the local model r2 0 482 but both reconstructions were considered for this study 3 2 global circulation index predictors global circulation indices are one of the variables which could be included in the apr model framework for these sites two reconstructions of the el ni√±o southern oscillation enso trenberth 1997 were considered as potential predictors enso is the dominant mode of interannual climate variability on earth and has a documented effect on the climate of north america deflorio et al 2013 zhou et al 2014 and utah in particular cayan et al 1999 schoennagel et al 2005 these reconstructions do not directly measure enso defined by sea surface temperature in the southern pacific ocean but rather capture its signature on tree ring growth over large regions known to be affected by enso in this way including reconstructions of enso provides a broader sample of tree ring chronologies to help characterize the spatial variability of interannual water balance the first enso reconstruction described in detail by li et al 2011 is based on the leading principal component pc of the north american drought atlas a reconstruction of annually resolved summer jja palmer drought severity index cook et al 1999 the leading pc of this reconstruction is most correlated with the january march jfm enso nino3 index r 0 51 and uses this relationship to extend the enso record back to 900 ce loading for the li et al 2011 reconstruction is centered on the american southwest with northern utah at the extreme northern range of strong loading values by comparison the li et al 2013 enso reconstruction uses tree ring chronologies from seven broad climate regions surrounding the pacific ocean including three in north america two in south america two in asia and one in new zealand this reconstruction captures a different portion of the enso signal and is best correlated with a region further west in the southern pacific ocean enso nino3 4 index during the previous november january ndj the larger archive of tree ring chronologies used by li et al 2013 produces a better estimate during the observed period r 0 80 but only extends back to 1300 ce because their different underlying tree ring chronologies capture different parts of the enso signal geographic extent and season these reconstructions are considered complementary to one another they are included here to demonstrate the flexibility and potential for including large scale climate index reconstructions particularly in regions with known teleconnections 3 3 tree ring chronology analysis the final set of potential reconstruction predictor variables are based on regional tree ring chronologies 49 chronologies located within a maximum 450 km radius of the reconstruction gauges all tree ring sites had limited soil development and occurred on southerly or westerly aspects occupying open canopy positions chronologies included seven different species douglas fir pseudotsuga menziesii two needle pinyon pinus edulis singleleaf pinyon pinus monophylla limber pine pinus flexilis ponderosa pine pinus ponderosa utah juniper juniperus osteosperma and rocky mountain juniper juniperus scopulorum tree ring indices ie chronologies were developed using the same approach for each site using the dplr package bunn 2008 individual tree ring series were detrended using a cubic smoothing spline with a frequency cut off of 50 at a wavelength of 2 3 of the length of the time series to remove variability potentially associated with stand dynamics or biological growth trends tree ring series were then averaged using a robust biweight mean autocorrelation was retained in the resultant tree ring chronologies preliminary analysis not presented showed that correlation between monthly flow percentiles differed across selected tree ring chronologies suggesting that different chronologies could be used to highlight unique portions of the seasonal hydroclimatic signal such findings have been noted in previous studies such as brubaker 1980 which showed that the first two principal components of regional tree ring chronologies explained different summer and winter precipitation responses and were related to varying species douglas fir and ponderosa pine regional tree ring chronologies were selected to include a range of species elevations and locations in an effort to highlight the most important factors for predicting seasonal flow because tree ring chronologies can be highly correlated principal component analysis pca was used to isolate unique differences in response reducing the chronologies to a smaller set of orthogonal principal components pcs that explain a majority of the original tree ring variance the number of retained pcs was based on the kaiser guttman criterion kaiser 1960 guttman 1954 defined as pcs with eigenvalues greater than 1 and by identifying a significant change in variance explained through a scree plot these stopping criteria are thought to slightly overestimate the number of retained components jackson 1993 which is desirable in the context of maximizing seasonal variability across multiple chronologies the regional tree ring chronologies have varying lengths primarily due to differences in their earliest measurements 800 1763 ce fig 1 traditional pca requires a fully defined data matrix and therefore would require a trade off either removing short chronologies to lengthen the time series or producing pcs beginning in 1763 ce based on the common period to avoid this limitation and to capture potentially valuable information in the shorter chronologies missing values were imputed using the missmda package josse et al 2016 in r prior to pca analysis the number of components was determined by 10 fold cross validation minimizing mean squared error mse across 100 simulations josse and husson 2012 missing values were imputed using an iterative algorithm which cycles between estimating missing values and recalculating pcs until the observed and fitted values converge pc scores were calculated in this way for a 600 year duration and compared to loadings derived from traditional pca using approximately 400 1610 ce 36 chronologies and 600 year 1390 ce 19 chronologies subsets selected based on inflection points in chronology availability fig 1 a third cut off point at 900 years was initially considered but dismissed because the number of available time series 4 was less than the optimal number of pcs to retain the imputed pca results did not significantly change results and was therefore used for all subsequent analysis the logan and bear river sites were located close enough to each other that the same pca scores were used for both locations 3 4 model fitting each of the model variants were fit based on usgs stream gauge data calculated by accumulating daily flows to determine mean monthly flow models were fit using the paleoapr package in r stagge 2017 the entire observed period 7 1942 to 9 2016 for bear river and 10 1921 to 9 2015 for logan river was used as the dependent variable for fitting the models for each site two reconstruction models were generated the first using the true observed maf as training data and the second using the reconstructed maf the model using observed maf provides an upper envelope for model performance given perfect input data while the model using reconstructed maf provides an estimate of model fit that can be expected for the full reconstruction the apr models were the only reconstruction models in this study that rely on regression regression fitting was performed using elastic nets zou and hastie 2005 chosen as an alternative to traditional step wise ordinary least squares regression used in previous reconstructions cook et al 1994 hidalgo et al 2000 elastic nets are designed to solve issues with stepwise regression reducing overfitting while also handling high dimensional data with multi collinearity this is accomplished by blending ridge regression hoerl and kennard 1970 and lasso least absolute shrinkage and selection operator regression tibshirani 1997 tibshirani 1996 using a term Œ± that can range from 0 ridge regression to 1 lasso regression blending these models combines the benefits of each ridge regression is effective at reducing overfitting and handling highly related predictors while the lasso approach can perform variable selection by shrinking non significant coefficients to zero ridge and lasso regression use similar approaches that seek to minimize the sum of mean squared error along with a penalty term the penalty terms are the primary difference between the approaches using either the square of model coefficients Œ≤ 2 in ridge regression or the absolute value of the model coefficients Œ≤ in lasso regression the penalty is then multiplied by a shrinkage parameter Œª calibration and validation of the apr models was performed by tuning the blending Œ± and shrinkage Œª terms in the elastic net regression the best parameter set was chosen from a grid search of a 10 100 Œ± Œª grid using 10 fold cross validation repeated 8 times with random selections with rmse as the selection criterion this produces effective validation and variable selection simultaneously because as the Œ± approaches 1 lasso regression and the Œª penalty increases non significant variables are removed from the regression by setting them to zero the apr model assumes that reconstructed flow percentiles should approximate the standard normal distribution with a mean of 0 and variance of 1 during the reference period this assumption follows from the univariate probability distributions which were defined using flows during the reference period and are ultimately used to convert monthly flows into the standard normal and vice versa to guarantee that reconstructed flow normals during the reference period approximate the standard normal a post processing step was added to the apr model to correct the mean and variance for each month extending this correction across the full reconstruction 3 5 model goodness of fit goodness of fit was evaluated using a suite of tests and measures during the common reference period of 10 1942 to 9 2015 to allow for equal comparisons across the two sites these goodness of fit measures included mean error me to estimate systematic model bias mean absolute error mae and root mean squared error rmse to estimate the residual magnitudes measures of parametric pearson r and non parametric spearman rspearman correlation and nash sutcliffe efficiency nse to estimate overall model predictive power in addition residual and time series plots were generated to allow for visual inspection of residual patterns or timing issues that might not be captured by these metrics mccuen et al 2006 criss and winston 2008 finally model fit was evaluated for each month separately using the same goodness of fit metrics and residual plots this allowed for a more detailed review of model performance particularly in months with low flow which could otherwise be obscured by high flow periods in the full time series 4 results 4 1 monthly fraction mf model fitting estimation of the mf model required only the calculation of the mean monthly proportion of flow the logan and bear river sites showed similar seasonal patterns with strong seasonality and flow peaks in the summer caused by delayed melting of the winter snowpack fig 2 fig 2 presents all available years with the mean monthly fraction used for reconstruction shown as a dark line logan river fig 2a had a higher proportion as baseflow and more gradual rising and falling limbs around a peak which occurred in may or june the bear river fig 2b had a more drastic seasonal peak flow that predominantly occurred in june and occasionally may 4 2 annual percentile ap model fitting the primary model fitting task for the ap model was to determine the best cumulative probability distribution for the maf and each of the monthly flows for both sites skewness kurtosis plots recommended the use of a gamma distribution for monthly flows and a logistic distribution for maf choice of these distributions was further supported by low aic values and non significant tests for violations of the candidate empirical cumulative distributions the logistic distribution used for annual flows was nearly gaussian but with slightly thicker tails while the gamma distribution used for monthly flows accounted for the positively skewed nature of monthly flows combined with a lower bound at zero 4 3 apr model with lagged annual reconstructions the apr model with lagged annual flows reconstruction was equivalent to a temporal disaggregation of the original reconstruction and required model coefficients for the effect of the lagged 1 0 1 annual standard normal values on each of the monthly normalized percentiles the resulting fit fig 3 showed that the importance of the reconstructed annual flow quantified by the coefficient transitions between the reconstructed flow from the previous year 1 to the concurrent year 0 for both locations for the logan river fig 3a this transition was gradual the crossover point occurred in march while the highest model coefficients occurred during the peak and falling limb of the seasonal hydrograph june through september before being carried over into the next water year the bear river had a much more abrupt transition fig 3b between the previous water year which explained october through march and the concurrent water year which explained monthly flow from june through the end of the water year as expected the future 1 water year reconstruction had little to no predictive power for monthly flows 4 4 tree ring chronology analysis from the imputed regional tree ring dataset which included all 49 chronologies fig 1 8 pcs were retained based on minimizing mse from repeated 10 fold cross validation this result was similar to the result from a traditional pca and a smaller 36 chronologies dataset which recommended retaining 8 pcs based on the kaiser guttman criterion as expected the smaller 600 year 19 chronology dataset had a smaller range of species and sites which resulted in the retention of only 5 pcs retaining 8 pcs with imputation was therefore deemed reasonable in all tests the first pc pc1 explained a large proportion of the total variance from 38 4 in the imputed dataset to 33 9 and 35 7 in the 400 and 600 year datasets respectively the proportion of variance explained by subsequent pcs fell after pc1 from 7 8 to 2 7 between pcs 2 and 8 and ultimately explained 73 1 of the total variance loadings for the imputed dataset were nearly identical to loadings from the traditional pca based on spatial and species patterns which further validated the imputation scheme while a total of eight pcs were considered as predictors focus was given to the first five as these represented a majority of the explained variance pc1 was the only pc where all chronologies loaded in the same direction fig 4 because of this common pattern and the relatively large variance explained pc1 appeared to characterize the general dry or wet state of the entire region loading for pc1 was dominated by douglas fir from low elevation sites fig 4 however this does not mean that douglas fir was necessarily best at capturing the region s hydroclimatology for example both annual reconstructions allen et al 2013 derose et al 2015 originally considered douglas fir chronologies but instead relied on other species that better explained maf instead douglas fir likely dominated pc1 because they have good predictive skill and were the best represented species 43 among the available chronologies covering the largest spatial extent while pc1 explained regional hydroclimatology and a major portion of the variability among all chronologies subsequent pcs captured smaller spatial and species specific patterns and deviations from the larger climate signal fig 4 pc loadings are shown spatially and by species in fig 4 and were summarized as pc1 general hydroclimatology as captured by douglas fir at lower elevations pc2 dipole between bear river douglas fir and southern utah pinyon ponderosa pine pc3 high elevation sites dominated by two limber pine and two douglas fir chronologies pc4 east west dipole between utah juniper species and wyoming douglas fir limber pines pc5 dipole between juniper sites near the logan river and a singleleaf pinyon site in the great basin subsequent pcs supplemental figures become more site specific and explained less variance 4 5 apr model with additional reconstructions more complex apr models were fitted first adding enso indices to the lagged annual flow reconstructions and then adding regional tree ring pcs termed all predictors model coefficients for the lagged annual flow reconstruction had nearly identical shapes as those presented in section 4 3 and fig 3 with a transition from the prior year s reconstruction to the current year crossing in spring march may this transition was more gradual for the logan river and more dramatic for bear river the logan and bear river sites had broadly similar responses to the two enso reconstructions at both locations enso 3 4 reconstructed using pacific ocean proxies li et al 2013 produced a negative response beginning in january fig 5 this effect continued throughout the winter spring and summer for the logan river fig 5a while its effect was absent during the spring for the bear river reconstruction fig 5c the negative sign of this coefficient suggests that estimated flows at both sites should be decreased when november through january enso 3 4 reconstructed by pacific proxies is strongly positive and vice versa enso3 as quantified by tree rings from the north american drought atlas nada li et al 2011 amplified the effect of the pacific proxies during march and april but contributed an opposite effect during the summer june through august fig 5a and c see section 5 2 for a more detailed discussion of these model predictors for both sites pc1 had an insignificant effect as a predictor within the apr model the only significant regional tree ring predictor during the fall october december was pc3 fig 5b and d during the winter pcs 6 and 7 provided additional information for both sites pc4 was the most important component during the winter for the bear river site fig 5b but does not appear in the logan model fig 5d spring showed little consistency among pc coefficients at both sites several regional tree ring signals were important during the summer with components 2 5 and 7 providing the largest and most consistent effects at both sites fig 5b and d pc8 displayed a unique effect during the summer with a strongly negative coefficient for the logan river site and a weakly positive coefficient for the bear river site lagged pc effects were initially considered using lags of 2 to 2 years but were ultimately removed due to weak explanatory skill and concerns about over fitting 4 6 goodness of fit the apr model with all predictors produced the best fit across all goodness of fit measures which included analyses of the full time series monthly fit residual patterns and visual inspection considering the full time series goodness of fit improved for nearly all measures mae rmse nse r with increasing numbers of parameters except for mean error table 1 correlations r for the apr model with all predictors and the observed maf was 0 97 for the logan river and 0 96 for the bear river this represents an assumed best possible fit given that observed annual flows were exactly known in all cases using annual flows reconstructed from tree rings lowered the goodness of fit decreasing r to 0 93 and 0 94 for the logan and bear rivers respectively for many fit measures as additional parameters were added to the model not only did the overall fit improve but the gap between observed annual flows and reconstructed annual flows decreased the mf model is unique in that it excelled at minimizing me i e systematic bias but tended to perform only moderate well to poorly for other measures goodness of fit at the monthly scale provided more detailed information about model performance using the nse as a goodness of fit measure it was clear that the mf and ap models have little predictive power nse 0 for much of the early water year from october until late winter or spring fig 6 the mf model performed particularly poorly during this period there was a rapid increase in model skill during may and june when the majority of annual flow volume occurred fig 2 the mf and ap models performed similarly during this period with the mf model performing slightly better for reconstructed annual flows fig 6b and d nse remained high for the remainder of the water year removing the pre defined water year in the apr model with lagged annual reconstruction predictors represented the largest structural improvement among the models fig 7 improvement by the apr model occurred primarily during the early part of the water year from october until march or april fig 7 april was unique in its consistently poor reconstruction skill across all models expanding the apr model to include global climate indices and regional tree rings produced smaller but still significant improvements in model fit the largest improvements occurred in the bear river where inclusion of these additional predictors improved fits for all months though still showing relatively poor fits during the spring season fig 6d fit for the logan river was quite good without these additional predictors with the most noticeable improvement occurring during the difficult spring months and the summer fig 6b fit during october through january on the logan river site remained relatively low in quality though still much improved over the ap or mf models when the model predictors were added successively fig 7 the enso reconstructions provide a smaller incremental improvement than the regional tree rings a sample of the historical reconstruction for both sites is presented in fig 8 highlighting a period of severe regional drought during the 1730s ce woodhouse and brown 2001 the entire reconstructed timeseries is available online athttp www paleoflow org by instead focusing on the observed period and visually comparing reconstructed to observed flows fig 8b it was possible to confirm the good fit of the apr model and to identify structural errors in the mf and ap models in the mf and ap models the transition between water years was not smooth and sometimes produced drastic jumps in flow particularly between years with very different annual reconstructed flow such as between 1961 and 1962 ce on the logan river fig 8b this shift from a dry to wet year produced a sudden increase in flow at the water year transition prior to the high flow period recorded in the observations this type of error was not present in the apr models due to the smooth transition between annual reconstructions including all predictors in the apr model smoothed annual transitions and improved the fit and shape of the rising and falling hydrograph limbs fig 8b and d despite only producing a modest improvement in monthly and annual fit metrics this finding was further supported by reduced residuals for medium and low flows in the non peak season when using regional tree rings and global climate indices without post processing the regression equations often reduced the variance of the estimated monthly flow normalized anomalies the resulting variance ranged from 0 24 to 0 91 across all months with median values of 0 71 and 0 66 for the logan and bear river sites respectively this resulted in underestimation of extreme high flows and overestimation of extreme low flows increasing variance to 1 through post processing greatly improved the fit for extreme flows and the resulting flow distribution while slightly decreasing overall goodness of fit 5 discussion 5 1 reconstruction model comparison of the models proposed in this study the apr model provides the most favorable measures of goodness of fit this model produces nse greater than zero 0 26 0 60 for all months except april and pearson s correlation coefficients r are 0 94 and 0 88 for the bear and logan rivers respectively confirming that the model can adequately reproduce monthly reference period flows goodness of fit decreases slightly when using reconstructed maf rather than observed maf but this decrease is minor and reasonable given the challenge and potential benefit of reconstructing centuries of streamflow at a monthly scale the mf model is the simplest approach but it makes a strong assumption about seasonal flows namely that the hydrograph shape is constant and thus independent of annual flow because of this assumption the mf model accurately captures flows during the peak but tends to produce errors in timing and magnitude for all other parts of the year this is particularly an issue for low flows which are scaled linearly with annual flow this assumption is not reasonable because groundwater sources typically provide a buffer to extreme low flows additionally the mf model produces artifacts at the transitions between water years the only metric for which the mf model excels is mean error a measure of consistent model bias this is because the mf model relies on the seasonal mean proportion which in turn ensures that reconstructed flows are evenly distributed around mean flows even if accuracy is poor the ap model addresses the issue of hydrograph shape allowing the shape to change with annual flow percentile but it retains the limitation of applying the same percentile across the entire water year this also produces calculation artifacts at the water year transitions and scaling errors that propagate backwards in time from the peak season this results in little or no predictive power prior to the peak flow season another potential limitation of the ap approach is the potential for generating negative flows if the univariate distribution used to transform flows does not have a lower bound here we have prevented this by selecting a distribution that is strictly positive the introduction of regression in the apr model provides the most significant improvement in reconstruction quality with this improvement the gap in nse decreased between models using reconstructed maf and models using observed maf models using observed maf have perfect flow estimates at the annual scale and were therefore considered the likely maximum goodness of fit for the sites examined here using a flexible regression approach allowed fall and winter low flows to retain information from the prior flow peak rather than depending on the peak flow yet to occur adding additional predictors such as global climate indices and regional tree ring signals provides further model improvement particularly in difficult to reconstruct months regional tree rings were the second most important set of predictors followed by global climate indices defined here by two enso reconstructions when considering the use of these models for other sites the modeler must consider the potential trade off between improved model fit and reconstruction length because the reconstruction will be limited by the length of the shortest reconstruction the approach provided here attempted to minimize this limitation for the set of regional tree rings through a process of pca imputation it should be noted that correlation r values shown here for the full time series are not directly comparable to r values from annual reconstructions because some of the variance explained is due to capturing the seasonal pattern of flows still the r values are exceptionally good and further supported by excellent model skill measured for individual months the apr model had difficulty modeling flows at both sites during the months of april and may during these months all coefficients for external predictors were either set to zero or the coefficients became large and opposed these are the two opposed behaviors of lasso and ridge regression respectively within the elastic net framework as one or the other attempts to handle poor predictive skill for the bear river in particular none of the reconstructed climate indices or regional tree ring chronologies showed any predictive capabilities in april including the lagged annual reconstruction this is likely because april and may occur at the beginning of the snowmelt season when minor changes in temperature near 0 c and solar radiation can produce large changes in snowmelt runoff and flow rapid changes in temperature that likely drive snowmelt timing and amount are unlikely to be directly captured in growing season ring width indices such as those used in this study for future implementations of the apr model it will be important to consider additional climatic predictors to help improve the explanation of spring snowmelt timing 5 2 interpretation of model predictors in addition to providing the best model fit the inclusion of external predictors in the apr model provides an opportunity to explore the effect of global teleconnections and regional hydroclimatology on local streamflow as a form of validation however it is important to note this study was not designed to test these links or to isolate their effects all predictors were considered simultaneously in the apr model and therefore if the effect of a given driver is accounted for by another measure it would not appear to be significant for instance if the effect of enso is already accounted for in the annual maf reconstruction or modeled better by the regional patterns of tree rings it would not appear in the final model the canonical understanding of enso effects on western u s climate is that positive enso index values are associated with a warmer drier winter in northern states and a wetter cooler winter in the south cayan et al 1999 redmond and koch 1991 the logan and bear river sites are situated near the geographic transition between the drier north and wetter south impacts of positive enso deflorio et al 2013 zhou et al 2014 however this traditional understanding of the teleconnection does not always hold because it can be modified by other more local effects additionally recent studies have questioned enso s effect across large portions of the western u s malevich and woodhouse 2017 for all of these reasons enso was screened as a potential predictor alongside regional and local tree rings using multiple regression the apr model results associated with the li et al 2013 reconstruction using pacific ocean proxies were consistent with prior studies allen et al 2013 cayan et al 1999 redmond and koch 1991 kurtzman and scanlon 2007 the logan river exhibited a negative relationship to enso due to its northern location which began in the winter and continued throughout the year the bear river site s more southern location exhibited only a minor winter response while the lack of strong enso relationship in the bear river reconstruction can partially be attributed to its latitude its unique orientation in the watershed may also play a role the bear river site is located along the north slope of the uinta mountains the most prominent east west oriented mountain in the united states and which exceeds elevations of 4 000 m this large mountain range receives substantial winter snow due to orographic effects on pacific westerlies and can block or redirect southern storm tracks both sites showed a consistent and opposite response during summer to the enso3 reconstruction based on the nada summer palmer drought severity index pdsi reconstruction li et al 2011 based on the summer effect which coincides with the underlying nada summer jja reconstruction we hypothesize that the contribution of the li et al 2011 reconstruction is more strongly related to capturing some of the nada tree ring signal than truly measuring an enso3 teleconnection on summer flows it should be noted that enso winter effects for both reconstructions are slightly delayed from their enso definition li et al 2013 reconstructs enso3 4 during november through january and this reconstruction enters the flow model in january while li et al 2011 reconstructs enso3 for january through march and enters the flow model in march and april this provides greater confidence that there is a true influence rather than modeling noise the pacific decadal oscillation pdo mantua and hare 2002 was initially considered as a third predictor because it has a demonstrated link to northern utah climate over the recent observed climate record particularly when considered in conjunction with enso wang et al 2009b wang et al 2009a inclusion of a pdo reconstruction predictor biondi et al 2001 increased model fit significantly during the fall however this teleconnection was ultimately excluded from this study because other pdo reconstructions show little agreement and thus high uncertainty outside the observed period newman et al 2016 further macdonald and case 2005 concluded that while enso reconstructions showed a persistent effect on northern utah climate the multidecadal variability of the pdo for the past two hundred years has not been stable therefore while future studies could examine the link between logan and bear river flow during fall and tree rings along the west coast of the united states and mexico it was deemed too uncertain for consideration here regional tree ring predictors were also useful for validating model results pc1 was likely not important for explaining regional wet dry variability because this measure of overall wetness is already captured by the annual flow reconstructions in the model pc2 was an important predictor for monthly summer flow at both sites the spatial pattern of pc2 mirrors the enso dipole where northerly sites predominantly douglas fir responded in an opposite manner to more southerly species which were primarily two needle pinyon but also ponderosa pine and douglas fir this counterintuitive result is best explained by considering that the annual streamflow reconstruction already explains much of the variability associated with tree ring sites located near the gauges leaving the north south chronology dichotomy to mediate baseflow recession and prevent flows from decreasing excessively during dry years pc3 directly captured variability in ring width at high elevation sites and should therefore reflect variation in monthly streamflow not predicted by the more prevalent low elevation sites pc3 was most important in late fall and winter october through january and again during april and may this likely represents a rough measure of temperature signifying the transition to snow in the fall and melt in the spring pc4 though only a factor in the bear river winter indicated an east west dipole identified in previous studies wang et al 2009b the other important winter predictors pcs 6 and 7 relied on a few important tree rings along the wyoming border which appear to be related to snow or winter flow summer predictors are more varied spatially but it is important to note that pc8 which is significant for the logan reconstruction relies on several tree ring chronologies near the logan site that behave slightly differently from the surrounding area this can be seen as a fine tuning predictor 5 3 sources of uncertainty as with all climate reconstructions the underlying climate proxies represent a source of uncertainty in this case uncertainty regarding the tree ring chronologies was minimized by carefully selecting chronology sites using multiple samples per tree and ensuring sufficient replication sample depth for each chronology other sources of uncertainty include the univariate probability distributions used to normalize flows it is assumed that reference period flows used to fit these distributions are representative we have carefully chosen the logan and bear river sites to minimize upstream watershed changes that produce discontinuities or non climate related trends in the observed flow record 5 4 implications for water management the model presented here is the first approach to reconstruct monthly streamflows directly from tree ring chronologies and climate reconstructions without routing climate reconstructions through a hydrologic model with reasonable estimates of monthly flow extending many centuries back in time water managers can challenge systems models with a larger range of natural variability in the duration and severity of drought and pluvial events this could significantly increase the potential for the use of streamflow reconstructions in water management applications permitting better drought vulnerability simulations and more robust optimization of reservoir operations for example engineers are often asked to design systems to address drought events with 100 year return periods in watersheds where the observed flow record is shorter than 100 years extrapolation using extreme value analysis can estimate the magnitude of a hypothetical event but multi century flow reconstructions likely include more useful and realistic scenarios multi year or decadal periods of drought and successive small drought events can challenge water management operations and reservoir recovery in ways that a single severe drought event does not establishing a long catalog of near natural flow is also critical when estimating future hydrologic risks under conditions of a non stationary climate other available methodologies used to reconstruct sub annual streamflows gangopadhyay et al 2015 sauchyn and ilich 2017 do not use tree rings to directly estimate monthly flows instead they generate many feasible sub annual scenarios either by stochastic hydrology sauchyn and ilich 2017 or resampling temperature and precipitation as inputs to a water balance model gangopadhyay et al 2015 these approaches have benefits producing many ensembles to be used for water systems model simulations and ensuring water balance within large watersheds gangopadhyay et al 2015 however they also have several limitations not present in the apr model first by resampling complete water years the number of potential temperature and precipitation time series are limited to the years in the observed record gangopadhyay et al 2015 if this method were applied to the logan and bear rivers there would be 88 and 68 potential annual segments respectively using k 10 nearest neighbor resampling the same years would be repeated across many realizations this ensures realistic years but severely limits variation within the range of observed conditions and prevents reasonable extrapolation slightly outside this range second by requiring a fully developed water balance model this approach limits its applicability to regions that have adequate gauge data and modeling the apr model proposed here has both greater flexibility and lower data requirements avoiding the need for developing a full hydrologic model while also allowing a freer range of flows still constrained by the historical flow distribution the apr model also provides a direct statistical link between tree ring proxies and global circulation drivers that can be used for model validation we assert that the approach outlined here provides several important improvements over the method of gangopadhyay et al 2015 at the same time we note that these two methods are fundamentally different and designed to address different research questions the gangopadhyay et al 2015 method focuses on capturing uncertainty and ranges of potential flow while the apr method proposed here focuses on a single best estimate given the value of monthly streamflow reconstructions for water managers and the potential growth in this new field of research it is important for future studies to test the global applicability of both methods by evaluating their use outside the western u s this study as well as the prior efforts to reconstruct monthly flows has focused on a relatively narrow geographical area of the western u s given the potential value for monthly reconstructions in water resources and the availability of climate sensitive tree ring chronologies elsewhere in the world there is an important opportunity to test whether these approaches can be applied globally 6 conclusions a new framework for generating monthly streamflows directly from annual reconstructions was introduced and demonstrated using two sites in northern utah several potential models were evaluated beginning with a simple monthly flow ratio mf model introducing a link between annual and monthly percentiles ap model allowing lagged annual flows to predict monthly percentiles apr model and ultimately including regional and global indices as regressors apr model with predictors of the different models tested the apr model was shown to successfully reproduce flows across nearly all months and across the entire range of flows this model can be applied using only data from annual flow reconstructions or can incorporate regional tree ring chronologies and global climate index reconstructions adding these additional predictors was shown to improve predictive skill while also providing insight with regard to streamflow drivers more simple model variants were presented as a comparison and to highlight potential modeling challenges such as sudden flow jumps at water year transitions while annual paleostreamflow reconstructions have great potential for use in water resources planning tingstad et al 2014 rice et al 2009 woodhouse and lukas 2006 axelson et al 2009 their annual resolution is a potential limitation monthly reconstructions rather than annual are therefore extremely valuable for drought vulnerability planning this study shows that monthly flow reconstructions are feasible and presents a new model that makes monthly paleostreamflow reconstruction more tractable this will hopefully

7524,paleoclimate reconstructions are increasingly used to characterize annual climate variability prior to the instrumental record to improve estimates of climate extremes and to provide a baseline for climate change projections to date paleoclimate records have seen limited engineering use to estimate hydrologic risks because water systems models and managers usually require streamflow input at the monthly scale this study explores the hypothesis that monthly streamflows can be adequately modeled by statistically decomposing annual flow reconstructions to test this hypothesis a multiple linear regression model for monthly streamflow reconstruction is presented that expands the set of predictors to include annual streamflow reconstructions reconstructions of global circulation and potential differences among regional tree ring chronologies related to tree species and geographic location this approach is used to reconstruct 600 years of monthly streamflows at two sites on the bear and logan rivers in northern utah nash sutcliffe efficiencies remain above zero 0 26 0 60 for all months except april and pearson s correlation coefficients r are 0 94 and 0 88 for the bear and logan rivers respectively confirming that the model can adequately reproduce monthly flows during the reference period 10 1942 to 9 2015 incorporating a flexible transition between the previous and concurrent annual reconstructed flows was the most important factor for model skill expanding the model to include global climate indices and regional tree ring chronologies produced smaller but still significant improvements in model fit the model presented here is the only approach currently available to reconstruct monthly streamflows directly from tree ring chronologies and climate reconstructions rather than using resampling of the observed record with reasonable estimates of monthly flow that extend back in time many centuries water managers can challenge systems models with a larger range of natural variability in drought and pluvial events and better evaluate extreme events with recurrence intervals longer than the observed record establishing this natural baseline is critical when estimating future hydrologic risks under conditions of a non stationary climate keywords paleoclimate streamflow reconstruction tree ring global circulation dendrochronology 1 introduction while grappling with the question of how future climate changes will affect the likelihood and severity of hydrological extremes floods and droughts hydrologists engineers and water resources planners have noted the potential for streamflow reconstructions to characterize pre industrial hydrologic variability over multiple centuries bonin and burn 2005 by combining reconstructions of the past with climate change projections it may be possible to place the signal of climate change induced streamflow trends in the context of long term natural variability in addition streamflow reconstructions can significantly increase the number of scenarios used for drought vulnerability studies or water resources systems optimization despite these potential benefits streamflow reconstructions have not gained widespread use in water systems analysis in part because flow has typically been reconstructed at an annual resolution which is generally too coarse for analysis of drought vulnerability and decision making this study explores whether monthly streamflows can be adequately predicted from annual tree ring chronologies and other reconstructed data to confirm this we outline and test a novel statistical method to reconstruct monthly flow series existing techniques for annual streamflow reconstruction primarily rely on linear regression to relate carefully chosen tree ring chronologies to mean annual flow maf during the available instrumental record this relationship is then applied to the full tree ring record to reconstruct flows outside the observed period loaiciga et al 1993 cook and kairiukstis 2013 tree ring chronologies are carefully developed by selecting sites and species in which the reconstruction variable is the limiting factor for tree growth multiple replication samples are often taken for each tree and these measurements across many trees at a given site are combined to generate a master site ring width through a process called crossdating whereby common features in the chronology are matched fritts 2012 douglass 1941 the resulting chronologies can be linked to climate variables either through simple linear regression duvick and blasing 1981 multiple linear regression meko et al 1980 or more complex approaches more complex reconstruction approaches often rely on principal component analysis pca to extract differences commonalities across multiple site chronologies and tree species to better capture regional variations cook et al 1994 hidalgo et al 2000 maxwell et al 2011 or seasonal effects brubaker 1980 meko et al 2015 showed that flow reconstruction accuracy can be improved by using pca and regression to combine chronologies from traditional reconstruction species and less traditional species which capture unique climate signals reconstruction approaches assume that processes relating climate to tree ring growth during the instrumental record are identical to the reconstructed period fritts 2012 this principle of uniformatism has been slightly modified in modern dendrochronology to separate the important climate signal from underlying factors affecting tree growth cook 1987 uniformitism is particularly important for flow reconstructions where river reaches should be selected to avoid significant man made effects alternatively the effects of impoundments or land use change can be removed from the time series to approximate a near natural flow record annual streamflow recontructions have been produced for regions with adequate tree ring chronologies meko et al 2001 woodhouse et al 2006 and have been used for water resources planning e g woodhouse and lukas 2006 and axelson et al 2009 despite the availability of annual streamflow reconstructions few methodologies currently exist to reconstruct sub annual flow from annual resolved tree ring chronologies gangopadhyay et al 2015 sauchyn and ilich 2017 the sauchyn and ilich 2017 approach uses stochastic hydrology techniques to generate many feasible sequences of weekly flows that sum to the annual reconstruction while maintaining statistical properties of the observed record the gangopadhyay et al 2015 approach instead resamples annual subsets of temperature and precipitation from the instrumental records and matches them to tree ring widths in the paleo record using a k nearest neighbor approach repeated many times to develop an ensemble of temperature and precipitation timeseries gangopadhyay et al 2009 temperature and precipitation are then used as inputs for a water balance model wolock and mccabe 1999 this method has been used to generate seasonal streamflow in nevada solander et al 2010 and monthly streamflow along the colorado river gangopadhyay et al 2015 while useful for generating runoff in well studied watersheds this approach requires a calibrated watershed model that is not always available additionally by resampling from the observed record the potential monthly time series of temperature and precipitation are limited to re ordering 60 100 observed annual subsets from the instrumental record while this may be an effective approach for some locations it is highly desirable to develop methods to reconstruct monthly streamflow directly without the need for watershed models and the limitations of repeated resampling to test the hypothesis that monthly streamflow can be reconstructed from annual tree ring chronologies this study introduces a novel approach for reconstructing monthly streamflow that extends fundamental principles of flow reconstruction and then demonstrates these models by reconstructing flow and evaluating goodness of fit for two sites in northern utah the candidate models include a simple monthly fraction mf model an annual percentile ap model that directly links annual flow percentile with monthly percentile and an annual percentile with regression apr model that uses multiple annual reconstructions to predict the monthly percentile several versions of the apr model are considered each adding increasing predictors which include 1 the original annual streamflow reconstructions 2 climate reconstructions of the el ni√±o southern oscillation enso and 3 regionally available tree ring chronologies regional tree ring chronologies were included as predictors based on the hypothesis that different species elevations and site locations might capture different parts of the seasonal hydrologic signal whereas enso was considered because it has shown coherence with streamflow and precipitation in the western u s and utah cayan et al 1999 schoennagel et al 2005 wang et al 2012 deflorio et al 2013 zhou et al 2014 the paper further evaluates and discusses model results in the context of individual predictors their physical basis and implications for water management 2 models three model frameworks are introduced in this study as potential candidates for the reconstruction of mean monthly streamflow the mf model uses simplistic assumptions to reconstruct monthly streamflows and is included as a null model against which the other models can be compared the remaining two models constitute the primary approach proposed herein and are presented in order of increasing complexity each applying the same basic framework but with increasing numbers of predictors first the ap model directly links the reconstructed annual streamflow percentiles to monthly percentiles using the assumption that the monthly percentile is constant and identical to the reconstructed annual percentile throughout each water year second the apr model estimates monthly percentiles using regression first considering only lagged annual streamflow percentiles and ultimately incorporating additional predictors such as global climate indices enso or spatial species patterns in regional tree ring chronologies extracted by pca the models and fitting procedures are available as an r package paleoapr stagge 2017 while the code and data for the specific analyses performed in this paper are available in an online repository athttps doi org 10 5281 zenodo 1029739 2 1 monthly fraction mf model the mf model assumes that the monthly proportion of total annual streamflow taf is identical across all years based on this assumption the monthly fraction f m y is determined for each month by dividing the monthly flow volume q m a by annual volume taf y in this notation m and a subscripts correspond to monthly and annual steps respectively taf is equivalent to 12 maf monthly streamflow is then reconstructed by multiplying the appropriate mean monthly fraction f m for each of the 12 months by reconstructed taf 1 q m f m taf a where f m a 1 n f m y n and f m a q m a taf a where q m represents estimated monthly streamflow monthly flows reconstructed by the mf model retain the same seasonal shape but are scaled linearly for example if an average of 30 of each year s historical flow volume occurred during june this proportion is maintained in the reconstruction prior to performing reconstruction the 12 f m values were re scaled to sum to 1 to ensure monthly flows would recreate the original maf reconstruction the mean f m was used to represent the monthly fraction rather than the median which made little difference in the case study results 2 2 annual percentile ap model the ap model forms the base for all subsequent reconstruction models it assumes that the streamflow percentile for each month is equivalent to the maf percentile for the particular water year that is if a given year s maf is in the 20th percentile then the mean flow for each month of that water year was also the 20th percentile determined by the cumulative probability distribution of flow for each month because subsequent models depend on a gaussian distribution we transformed the percentile 0 100 to a standard normal value to represented by the variable n 2 n m n a where n m is the estimated monthly standard normal and the subscripts m and a again represent monthly and annual values of the normalized streamflow percentile for use in the ap model a univariate probability distribution was fit to the maf and each of the monthly mean flows to permit transformation to and from the standard normal distribution non parametric alternatives such as empirical cumulative distributions were not considered because they limit the ability to extrapolate beyond the original data annual and monthly cumulative distributions were fit based on maximum likelihood estimation mle using the fitdistrplus package in r delignette muller and dutang 2015 candidate distributions were visually compared using skewness kurtosis plots cullen and frey 1999 evaluated with 500 nonparametric bootstrap realizations final selection of candidate distributions was further validated based on akaike information criterion aic quantile plots and results of kolmogorov smirnov and anderson darling tests statistical distribution tests were based on 5000 bootstrap simulations thereby avoiding the issue of applying tests where parameters are estimated from the data crutcher 1975 2 3 annual percentile with regression apr model the apr model has the same fundamental structure as the ap model without enforcing a 1 1 relationship between the annual and monthly standard normal values instead a unique regression model for each month was fit which estimated that month s streamflow percentile based on a number of potential predictors this regression approaches uses similar principles as other multiple linear regression reconstructions meko et al 1980 cook et al 1994 hidalgo et al 2000 it is designed to be flexible so that in future studies any variable with a demonstrated climate effect could be considered as a predictor three apr models of increasing complexity are considered in this study the first uses only the standard normal of the lagged percentiles from the annual streamflow reconstruction 3 n m 0 Œ≤ 1 n a 1 Œ≤ 0 n a 0 Œ≤ 1 n 1 where n m 0 represents monthly standard normal as in eq 2 and n a 1 n a 0 and n a 1 are annual normalized percentiles for the previous concurrent and future water years respectively the associated Œ≤ values are model coefficients fit using the regression approach described below transformation to standard normal values rather than percentiles was done to permit regression with standard normal residuals the model described in eq 3 is referred to as the apr model with lagged predictors it can be viewed as a temporal disaggregation of the original annual reconstruction using no additional data the lagged regression approach alleviates the need to explicitly define the most appropriate water year bounds as it is naturally derived based on predictive power the second and third variants of the apr model incorporate predictors outside the original annual reconstruction the second model adds two reconstructions of the enso climate index while the third model adds regional tree ring principal components these are referred to as apr with climate indices and apr with all predictors respectively with the full apr with all predictors model taking the form 4 n m 0 Œ≤ 1 n a 1 Œ≤ 0 n a 0 Œ≤ 1 n 1 Œ≤ enso enso j 1 8 Œ≤ j pc j where additional predictors for enso and regional tree ring principal components are included as Œ≤ enso and Œ≤ j respectively 3 methods 3 1 mean annual reconstructions the candidate monthly reconstruction approaches were applied at two sites with previously published annual streamflow reconstructions in the bear river watershed of northern utah flows in this region are snowmelt dominated with the majority of annual precipitation falling in the form of winter snow the two sites were located on the logan river and in the upper bear river both reconstructions allen et al 2013 derose et al 2015 used similar methods to reconstruct the maf based on the usgs water year of oct sep the bear river is located in the intermountain u s and is the single largest river in the eastern great basin it drains portions of northeastern utah southwestern wyoming and southeastern idaho with its headwaters located in the uinta mountains the bear river is the largest tributary to the great salt lake providing approximately 60 of its annual inflow the annual flow reconstruction for the upper bear river is based on the instrumental flow record from usgs gauge 1011500 1942 ce present this gauge is located near the furthest upstream utah wyoming border and includes flow contribution from a 445 km2 watershed along the north slope of the uinta mountains flow at this site contributes approximately 8 of the total bear river flow flow at this site is considered near natural as it is upstream of major diversions with only a single small storage reservoir located upstream the tree ring predictor data used to reconstruct maf was based on a nearby utah juniper juniperus osteosperma chronology the reconstruction derose et al 2015 covered the period 800 2010 ce and explained 67 of annual variation r2 0 672 the logan river is the largest tributary to the bear river and drains 1389 km2 of the bear river range in northeastern utah and southeastern idaho the maf reconstruction allen et al 2013 is based on usgs gauge 10109001 1922 ce present which captures the near natural upper portion 554 km2 of the logan river watershed prior to impoundments and diversions near the city of logan utah the reconstruction covers the period from 1605 to 2010 ce two reconstruction models were used one termed the local model that relied on two rocky mountain juniper juniperus scopulorum chronologies located within the logan river watershed and another termed the regional model that also incorporated a two needle pinyon pinus edulis chronology from north central utah and a limber pine pinus flexilis chronology from western wyoming the regional model showed better skill r2 0 581 than the local model r2 0 482 but both reconstructions were considered for this study 3 2 global circulation index predictors global circulation indices are one of the variables which could be included in the apr model framework for these sites two reconstructions of the el ni√±o southern oscillation enso trenberth 1997 were considered as potential predictors enso is the dominant mode of interannual climate variability on earth and has a documented effect on the climate of north america deflorio et al 2013 zhou et al 2014 and utah in particular cayan et al 1999 schoennagel et al 2005 these reconstructions do not directly measure enso defined by sea surface temperature in the southern pacific ocean but rather capture its signature on tree ring growth over large regions known to be affected by enso in this way including reconstructions of enso provides a broader sample of tree ring chronologies to help characterize the spatial variability of interannual water balance the first enso reconstruction described in detail by li et al 2011 is based on the leading principal component pc of the north american drought atlas a reconstruction of annually resolved summer jja palmer drought severity index cook et al 1999 the leading pc of this reconstruction is most correlated with the january march jfm enso nino3 index r 0 51 and uses this relationship to extend the enso record back to 900 ce loading for the li et al 2011 reconstruction is centered on the american southwest with northern utah at the extreme northern range of strong loading values by comparison the li et al 2013 enso reconstruction uses tree ring chronologies from seven broad climate regions surrounding the pacific ocean including three in north america two in south america two in asia and one in new zealand this reconstruction captures a different portion of the enso signal and is best correlated with a region further west in the southern pacific ocean enso nino3 4 index during the previous november january ndj the larger archive of tree ring chronologies used by li et al 2013 produces a better estimate during the observed period r 0 80 but only extends back to 1300 ce because their different underlying tree ring chronologies capture different parts of the enso signal geographic extent and season these reconstructions are considered complementary to one another they are included here to demonstrate the flexibility and potential for including large scale climate index reconstructions particularly in regions with known teleconnections 3 3 tree ring chronology analysis the final set of potential reconstruction predictor variables are based on regional tree ring chronologies 49 chronologies located within a maximum 450 km radius of the reconstruction gauges all tree ring sites had limited soil development and occurred on southerly or westerly aspects occupying open canopy positions chronologies included seven different species douglas fir pseudotsuga menziesii two needle pinyon pinus edulis singleleaf pinyon pinus monophylla limber pine pinus flexilis ponderosa pine pinus ponderosa utah juniper juniperus osteosperma and rocky mountain juniper juniperus scopulorum tree ring indices ie chronologies were developed using the same approach for each site using the dplr package bunn 2008 individual tree ring series were detrended using a cubic smoothing spline with a frequency cut off of 50 at a wavelength of 2 3 of the length of the time series to remove variability potentially associated with stand dynamics or biological growth trends tree ring series were then averaged using a robust biweight mean autocorrelation was retained in the resultant tree ring chronologies preliminary analysis not presented showed that correlation between monthly flow percentiles differed across selected tree ring chronologies suggesting that different chronologies could be used to highlight unique portions of the seasonal hydroclimatic signal such findings have been noted in previous studies such as brubaker 1980 which showed that the first two principal components of regional tree ring chronologies explained different summer and winter precipitation responses and were related to varying species douglas fir and ponderosa pine regional tree ring chronologies were selected to include a range of species elevations and locations in an effort to highlight the most important factors for predicting seasonal flow because tree ring chronologies can be highly correlated principal component analysis pca was used to isolate unique differences in response reducing the chronologies to a smaller set of orthogonal principal components pcs that explain a majority of the original tree ring variance the number of retained pcs was based on the kaiser guttman criterion kaiser 1960 guttman 1954 defined as pcs with eigenvalues greater than 1 and by identifying a significant change in variance explained through a scree plot these stopping criteria are thought to slightly overestimate the number of retained components jackson 1993 which is desirable in the context of maximizing seasonal variability across multiple chronologies the regional tree ring chronologies have varying lengths primarily due to differences in their earliest measurements 800 1763 ce fig 1 traditional pca requires a fully defined data matrix and therefore would require a trade off either removing short chronologies to lengthen the time series or producing pcs beginning in 1763 ce based on the common period to avoid this limitation and to capture potentially valuable information in the shorter chronologies missing values were imputed using the missmda package josse et al 2016 in r prior to pca analysis the number of components was determined by 10 fold cross validation minimizing mean squared error mse across 100 simulations josse and husson 2012 missing values were imputed using an iterative algorithm which cycles between estimating missing values and recalculating pcs until the observed and fitted values converge pc scores were calculated in this way for a 600 year duration and compared to loadings derived from traditional pca using approximately 400 1610 ce 36 chronologies and 600 year 1390 ce 19 chronologies subsets selected based on inflection points in chronology availability fig 1 a third cut off point at 900 years was initially considered but dismissed because the number of available time series 4 was less than the optimal number of pcs to retain the imputed pca results did not significantly change results and was therefore used for all subsequent analysis the logan and bear river sites were located close enough to each other that the same pca scores were used for both locations 3 4 model fitting each of the model variants were fit based on usgs stream gauge data calculated by accumulating daily flows to determine mean monthly flow models were fit using the paleoapr package in r stagge 2017 the entire observed period 7 1942 to 9 2016 for bear river and 10 1921 to 9 2015 for logan river was used as the dependent variable for fitting the models for each site two reconstruction models were generated the first using the true observed maf as training data and the second using the reconstructed maf the model using observed maf provides an upper envelope for model performance given perfect input data while the model using reconstructed maf provides an estimate of model fit that can be expected for the full reconstruction the apr models were the only reconstruction models in this study that rely on regression regression fitting was performed using elastic nets zou and hastie 2005 chosen as an alternative to traditional step wise ordinary least squares regression used in previous reconstructions cook et al 1994 hidalgo et al 2000 elastic nets are designed to solve issues with stepwise regression reducing overfitting while also handling high dimensional data with multi collinearity this is accomplished by blending ridge regression hoerl and kennard 1970 and lasso least absolute shrinkage and selection operator regression tibshirani 1997 tibshirani 1996 using a term Œ± that can range from 0 ridge regression to 1 lasso regression blending these models combines the benefits of each ridge regression is effective at reducing overfitting and handling highly related predictors while the lasso approach can perform variable selection by shrinking non significant coefficients to zero ridge and lasso regression use similar approaches that seek to minimize the sum of mean squared error along with a penalty term the penalty terms are the primary difference between the approaches using either the square of model coefficients Œ≤ 2 in ridge regression or the absolute value of the model coefficients Œ≤ in lasso regression the penalty is then multiplied by a shrinkage parameter Œª calibration and validation of the apr models was performed by tuning the blending Œ± and shrinkage Œª terms in the elastic net regression the best parameter set was chosen from a grid search of a 10 100 Œ± Œª grid using 10 fold cross validation repeated 8 times with random selections with rmse as the selection criterion this produces effective validation and variable selection simultaneously because as the Œ± approaches 1 lasso regression and the Œª penalty increases non significant variables are removed from the regression by setting them to zero the apr model assumes that reconstructed flow percentiles should approximate the standard normal distribution with a mean of 0 and variance of 1 during the reference period this assumption follows from the univariate probability distributions which were defined using flows during the reference period and are ultimately used to convert monthly flows into the standard normal and vice versa to guarantee that reconstructed flow normals during the reference period approximate the standard normal a post processing step was added to the apr model to correct the mean and variance for each month extending this correction across the full reconstruction 3 5 model goodness of fit goodness of fit was evaluated using a suite of tests and measures during the common reference period of 10 1942 to 9 2015 to allow for equal comparisons across the two sites these goodness of fit measures included mean error me to estimate systematic model bias mean absolute error mae and root mean squared error rmse to estimate the residual magnitudes measures of parametric pearson r and non parametric spearman rspearman correlation and nash sutcliffe efficiency nse to estimate overall model predictive power in addition residual and time series plots were generated to allow for visual inspection of residual patterns or timing issues that might not be captured by these metrics mccuen et al 2006 criss and winston 2008 finally model fit was evaluated for each month separately using the same goodness of fit metrics and residual plots this allowed for a more detailed review of model performance particularly in months with low flow which could otherwise be obscured by high flow periods in the full time series 4 results 4 1 monthly fraction mf model fitting estimation of the mf model required only the calculation of the mean monthly proportion of flow the logan and bear river sites showed similar seasonal patterns with strong seasonality and flow peaks in the summer caused by delayed melting of the winter snowpack fig 2 fig 2 presents all available years with the mean monthly fraction used for reconstruction shown as a dark line logan river fig 2a had a higher proportion as baseflow and more gradual rising and falling limbs around a peak which occurred in may or june the bear river fig 2b had a more drastic seasonal peak flow that predominantly occurred in june and occasionally may 4 2 annual percentile ap model fitting the primary model fitting task for the ap model was to determine the best cumulative probability distribution for the maf and each of the monthly flows for both sites skewness kurtosis plots recommended the use of a gamma distribution for monthly flows and a logistic distribution for maf choice of these distributions was further supported by low aic values and non significant tests for violations of the candidate empirical cumulative distributions the logistic distribution used for annual flows was nearly gaussian but with slightly thicker tails while the gamma distribution used for monthly flows accounted for the positively skewed nature of monthly flows combined with a lower bound at zero 4 3 apr model with lagged annual reconstructions the apr model with lagged annual flows reconstruction was equivalent to a temporal disaggregation of the original reconstruction and required model coefficients for the effect of the lagged 1 0 1 annual standard normal values on each of the monthly normalized percentiles the resulting fit fig 3 showed that the importance of the reconstructed annual flow quantified by the coefficient transitions between the reconstructed flow from the previous year 1 to the concurrent year 0 for both locations for the logan river fig 3a this transition was gradual the crossover point occurred in march while the highest model coefficients occurred during the peak and falling limb of the seasonal hydrograph june through september before being carried over into the next water year the bear river had a much more abrupt transition fig 3b between the previous water year which explained october through march and the concurrent water year which explained monthly flow from june through the end of the water year as expected the future 1 water year reconstruction had little to no predictive power for monthly flows 4 4 tree ring chronology analysis from the imputed regional tree ring dataset which included all 49 chronologies fig 1 8 pcs were retained based on minimizing mse from repeated 10 fold cross validation this result was similar to the result from a traditional pca and a smaller 36 chronologies dataset which recommended retaining 8 pcs based on the kaiser guttman criterion as expected the smaller 600 year 19 chronology dataset had a smaller range of species and sites which resulted in the retention of only 5 pcs retaining 8 pcs with imputation was therefore deemed reasonable in all tests the first pc pc1 explained a large proportion of the total variance from 38 4 in the imputed dataset to 33 9 and 35 7 in the 400 and 600 year datasets respectively the proportion of variance explained by subsequent pcs fell after pc1 from 7 8 to 2 7 between pcs 2 and 8 and ultimately explained 73 1 of the total variance loadings for the imputed dataset were nearly identical to loadings from the traditional pca based on spatial and species patterns which further validated the imputation scheme while a total of eight pcs were considered as predictors focus was given to the first five as these represented a majority of the explained variance pc1 was the only pc where all chronologies loaded in the same direction fig 4 because of this common pattern and the relatively large variance explained pc1 appeared to characterize the general dry or wet state of the entire region loading for pc1 was dominated by douglas fir from low elevation sites fig 4 however this does not mean that douglas fir was necessarily best at capturing the region s hydroclimatology for example both annual reconstructions allen et al 2013 derose et al 2015 originally considered douglas fir chronologies but instead relied on other species that better explained maf instead douglas fir likely dominated pc1 because they have good predictive skill and were the best represented species 43 among the available chronologies covering the largest spatial extent while pc1 explained regional hydroclimatology and a major portion of the variability among all chronologies subsequent pcs captured smaller spatial and species specific patterns and deviations from the larger climate signal fig 4 pc loadings are shown spatially and by species in fig 4 and were summarized as pc1 general hydroclimatology as captured by douglas fir at lower elevations pc2 dipole between bear river douglas fir and southern utah pinyon ponderosa pine pc3 high elevation sites dominated by two limber pine and two douglas fir chronologies pc4 east west dipole between utah juniper species and wyoming douglas fir limber pines pc5 dipole between juniper sites near the logan river and a singleleaf pinyon site in the great basin subsequent pcs supplemental figures become more site specific and explained less variance 4 5 apr model with additional reconstructions more complex apr models were fitted first adding enso indices to the lagged annual flow reconstructions and then adding regional tree ring pcs termed all predictors model coefficients for the lagged annual flow reconstruction had nearly identical shapes as those presented in section 4 3 and fig 3 with a transition from the prior year s reconstruction to the current year crossing in spring march may this transition was more gradual for the logan river and more dramatic for bear river the logan and bear river sites had broadly similar responses to the two enso reconstructions at both locations enso 3 4 reconstructed using pacific ocean proxies li et al 2013 produced a negative response beginning in january fig 5 this effect continued throughout the winter spring and summer for the logan river fig 5a while its effect was absent during the spring for the bear river reconstruction fig 5c the negative sign of this coefficient suggests that estimated flows at both sites should be decreased when november through january enso 3 4 reconstructed by pacific proxies is strongly positive and vice versa enso3 as quantified by tree rings from the north american drought atlas nada li et al 2011 amplified the effect of the pacific proxies during march and april but contributed an opposite effect during the summer june through august fig 5a and c see section 5 2 for a more detailed discussion of these model predictors for both sites pc1 had an insignificant effect as a predictor within the apr model the only significant regional tree ring predictor during the fall october december was pc3 fig 5b and d during the winter pcs 6 and 7 provided additional information for both sites pc4 was the most important component during the winter for the bear river site fig 5b but does not appear in the logan model fig 5d spring showed little consistency among pc coefficients at both sites several regional tree ring signals were important during the summer with components 2 5 and 7 providing the largest and most consistent effects at both sites fig 5b and d pc8 displayed a unique effect during the summer with a strongly negative coefficient for the logan river site and a weakly positive coefficient for the bear river site lagged pc effects were initially considered using lags of 2 to 2 years but were ultimately removed due to weak explanatory skill and concerns about over fitting 4 6 goodness of fit the apr model with all predictors produced the best fit across all goodness of fit measures which included analyses of the full time series monthly fit residual patterns and visual inspection considering the full time series goodness of fit improved for nearly all measures mae rmse nse r with increasing numbers of parameters except for mean error table 1 correlations r for the apr model with all predictors and the observed maf was 0 97 for the logan river and 0 96 for the bear river this represents an assumed best possible fit given that observed annual flows were exactly known in all cases using annual flows reconstructed from tree rings lowered the goodness of fit decreasing r to 0 93 and 0 94 for the logan and bear rivers respectively for many fit measures as additional parameters were added to the model not only did the overall fit improve but the gap between observed annual flows and reconstructed annual flows decreased the mf model is unique in that it excelled at minimizing me i e systematic bias but tended to perform only moderate well to poorly for other measures goodness of fit at the monthly scale provided more detailed information about model performance using the nse as a goodness of fit measure it was clear that the mf and ap models have little predictive power nse 0 for much of the early water year from october until late winter or spring fig 6 the mf model performed particularly poorly during this period there was a rapid increase in model skill during may and june when the majority of annual flow volume occurred fig 2 the mf and ap models performed similarly during this period with the mf model performing slightly better for reconstructed annual flows fig 6b and d nse remained high for the remainder of the water year removing the pre defined water year in the apr model with lagged annual reconstruction predictors represented the largest structural improvement among the models fig 7 improvement by the apr model occurred primarily during the early part of the water year from october until march or april fig 7 april was unique in its consistently poor reconstruction skill across all models expanding the apr model to include global climate indices and regional tree rings produced smaller but still significant improvements in model fit the largest improvements occurred in the bear river where inclusion of these additional predictors improved fits for all months though still showing relatively poor fits during the spring season fig 6d fit for the logan river was quite good without these additional predictors with the most noticeable improvement occurring during the difficult spring months and the summer fig 6b fit during october through january on the logan river site remained relatively low in quality though still much improved over the ap or mf models when the model predictors were added successively fig 7 the enso reconstructions provide a smaller incremental improvement than the regional tree rings a sample of the historical reconstruction for both sites is presented in fig 8 highlighting a period of severe regional drought during the 1730s ce woodhouse and brown 2001 the entire reconstructed timeseries is available online athttp www paleoflow org by instead focusing on the observed period and visually comparing reconstructed to observed flows fig 8b it was possible to confirm the good fit of the apr model and to identify structural errors in the mf and ap models in the mf and ap models the transition between water years was not smooth and sometimes produced drastic jumps in flow particularly between years with very different annual reconstructed flow such as between 1961 and 1962 ce on the logan river fig 8b this shift from a dry to wet year produced a sudden increase in flow at the water year transition prior to the high flow period recorded in the observations this type of error was not present in the apr models due to the smooth transition between annual reconstructions including all predictors in the apr model smoothed annual transitions and improved the fit and shape of the rising and falling hydrograph limbs fig 8b and d despite only producing a modest improvement in monthly and annual fit metrics this finding was further supported by reduced residuals for medium and low flows in the non peak season when using regional tree rings and global climate indices without post processing the regression equations often reduced the variance of the estimated monthly flow normalized anomalies the resulting variance ranged from 0 24 to 0 91 across all months with median values of 0 71 and 0 66 for the logan and bear river sites respectively this resulted in underestimation of extreme high flows and overestimation of extreme low flows increasing variance to 1 through post processing greatly improved the fit for extreme flows and the resulting flow distribution while slightly decreasing overall goodness of fit 5 discussion 5 1 reconstruction model comparison of the models proposed in this study the apr model provides the most favorable measures of goodness of fit this model produces nse greater than zero 0 26 0 60 for all months except april and pearson s correlation coefficients r are 0 94 and 0 88 for the bear and logan rivers respectively confirming that the model can adequately reproduce monthly reference period flows goodness of fit decreases slightly when using reconstructed maf rather than observed maf but this decrease is minor and reasonable given the challenge and potential benefit of reconstructing centuries of streamflow at a monthly scale the mf model is the simplest approach but it makes a strong assumption about seasonal flows namely that the hydrograph shape is constant and thus independent of annual flow because of this assumption the mf model accurately captures flows during the peak but tends to produce errors in timing and magnitude for all other parts of the year this is particularly an issue for low flows which are scaled linearly with annual flow this assumption is not reasonable because groundwater sources typically provide a buffer to extreme low flows additionally the mf model produces artifacts at the transitions between water years the only metric for which the mf model excels is mean error a measure of consistent model bias this is because the mf model relies on the seasonal mean proportion which in turn ensures that reconstructed flows are evenly distributed around mean flows even if accuracy is poor the ap model addresses the issue of hydrograph shape allowing the shape to change with annual flow percentile but it retains the limitation of applying the same percentile across the entire water year this also produces calculation artifacts at the water year transitions and scaling errors that propagate backwards in time from the peak season this results in little or no predictive power prior to the peak flow season another potential limitation of the ap approach is the potential for generating negative flows if the univariate distribution used to transform flows does not have a lower bound here we have prevented this by selecting a distribution that is strictly positive the introduction of regression in the apr model provides the most significant improvement in reconstruction quality with this improvement the gap in nse decreased between models using reconstructed maf and models using observed maf models using observed maf have perfect flow estimates at the annual scale and were therefore considered the likely maximum goodness of fit for the sites examined here using a flexible regression approach allowed fall and winter low flows to retain information from the prior flow peak rather than depending on the peak flow yet to occur adding additional predictors such as global climate indices and regional tree ring signals provides further model improvement particularly in difficult to reconstruct months regional tree rings were the second most important set of predictors followed by global climate indices defined here by two enso reconstructions when considering the use of these models for other sites the modeler must consider the potential trade off between improved model fit and reconstruction length because the reconstruction will be limited by the length of the shortest reconstruction the approach provided here attempted to minimize this limitation for the set of regional tree rings through a process of pca imputation it should be noted that correlation r values shown here for the full time series are not directly comparable to r values from annual reconstructions because some of the variance explained is due to capturing the seasonal pattern of flows still the r values are exceptionally good and further supported by excellent model skill measured for individual months the apr model had difficulty modeling flows at both sites during the months of april and may during these months all coefficients for external predictors were either set to zero or the coefficients became large and opposed these are the two opposed behaviors of lasso and ridge regression respectively within the elastic net framework as one or the other attempts to handle poor predictive skill for the bear river in particular none of the reconstructed climate indices or regional tree ring chronologies showed any predictive capabilities in april including the lagged annual reconstruction this is likely because april and may occur at the beginning of the snowmelt season when minor changes in temperature near 0 c and solar radiation can produce large changes in snowmelt runoff and flow rapid changes in temperature that likely drive snowmelt timing and amount are unlikely to be directly captured in growing season ring width indices such as those used in this study for future implementations of the apr model it will be important to consider additional climatic predictors to help improve the explanation of spring snowmelt timing 5 2 interpretation of model predictors in addition to providing the best model fit the inclusion of external predictors in the apr model provides an opportunity to explore the effect of global teleconnections and regional hydroclimatology on local streamflow as a form of validation however it is important to note this study was not designed to test these links or to isolate their effects all predictors were considered simultaneously in the apr model and therefore if the effect of a given driver is accounted for by another measure it would not appear to be significant for instance if the effect of enso is already accounted for in the annual maf reconstruction or modeled better by the regional patterns of tree rings it would not appear in the final model the canonical understanding of enso effects on western u s climate is that positive enso index values are associated with a warmer drier winter in northern states and a wetter cooler winter in the south cayan et al 1999 redmond and koch 1991 the logan and bear river sites are situated near the geographic transition between the drier north and wetter south impacts of positive enso deflorio et al 2013 zhou et al 2014 however this traditional understanding of the teleconnection does not always hold because it can be modified by other more local effects additionally recent studies have questioned enso s effect across large portions of the western u s malevich and woodhouse 2017 for all of these reasons enso was screened as a potential predictor alongside regional and local tree rings using multiple regression the apr model results associated with the li et al 2013 reconstruction using pacific ocean proxies were consistent with prior studies allen et al 2013 cayan et al 1999 redmond and koch 1991 kurtzman and scanlon 2007 the logan river exhibited a negative relationship to enso due to its northern location which began in the winter and continued throughout the year the bear river site s more southern location exhibited only a minor winter response while the lack of strong enso relationship in the bear river reconstruction can partially be attributed to its latitude its unique orientation in the watershed may also play a role the bear river site is located along the north slope of the uinta mountains the most prominent east west oriented mountain in the united states and which exceeds elevations of 4 000 m this large mountain range receives substantial winter snow due to orographic effects on pacific westerlies and can block or redirect southern storm tracks both sites showed a consistent and opposite response during summer to the enso3 reconstruction based on the nada summer palmer drought severity index pdsi reconstruction li et al 2011 based on the summer effect which coincides with the underlying nada summer jja reconstruction we hypothesize that the contribution of the li et al 2011 reconstruction is more strongly related to capturing some of the nada tree ring signal than truly measuring an enso3 teleconnection on summer flows it should be noted that enso winter effects for both reconstructions are slightly delayed from their enso definition li et al 2013 reconstructs enso3 4 during november through january and this reconstruction enters the flow model in january while li et al 2011 reconstructs enso3 for january through march and enters the flow model in march and april this provides greater confidence that there is a true influence rather than modeling noise the pacific decadal oscillation pdo mantua and hare 2002 was initially considered as a third predictor because it has a demonstrated link to northern utah climate over the recent observed climate record particularly when considered in conjunction with enso wang et al 2009b wang et al 2009a inclusion of a pdo reconstruction predictor biondi et al 2001 increased model fit significantly during the fall however this teleconnection was ultimately excluded from this study because other pdo reconstructions show little agreement and thus high uncertainty outside the observed period newman et al 2016 further macdonald and case 2005 concluded that while enso reconstructions showed a persistent effect on northern utah climate the multidecadal variability of the pdo for the past two hundred years has not been stable therefore while future studies could examine the link between logan and bear river flow during fall and tree rings along the west coast of the united states and mexico it was deemed too uncertain for consideration here regional tree ring predictors were also useful for validating model results pc1 was likely not important for explaining regional wet dry variability because this measure of overall wetness is already captured by the annual flow reconstructions in the model pc2 was an important predictor for monthly summer flow at both sites the spatial pattern of pc2 mirrors the enso dipole where northerly sites predominantly douglas fir responded in an opposite manner to more southerly species which were primarily two needle pinyon but also ponderosa pine and douglas fir this counterintuitive result is best explained by considering that the annual streamflow reconstruction already explains much of the variability associated with tree ring sites located near the gauges leaving the north south chronology dichotomy to mediate baseflow recession and prevent flows from decreasing excessively during dry years pc3 directly captured variability in ring width at high elevation sites and should therefore reflect variation in monthly streamflow not predicted by the more prevalent low elevation sites pc3 was most important in late fall and winter october through january and again during april and may this likely represents a rough measure of temperature signifying the transition to snow in the fall and melt in the spring pc4 though only a factor in the bear river winter indicated an east west dipole identified in previous studies wang et al 2009b the other important winter predictors pcs 6 and 7 relied on a few important tree rings along the wyoming border which appear to be related to snow or winter flow summer predictors are more varied spatially but it is important to note that pc8 which is significant for the logan reconstruction relies on several tree ring chronologies near the logan site that behave slightly differently from the surrounding area this can be seen as a fine tuning predictor 5 3 sources of uncertainty as with all climate reconstructions the underlying climate proxies represent a source of uncertainty in this case uncertainty regarding the tree ring chronologies was minimized by carefully selecting chronology sites using multiple samples per tree and ensuring sufficient replication sample depth for each chronology other sources of uncertainty include the univariate probability distributions used to normalize flows it is assumed that reference period flows used to fit these distributions are representative we have carefully chosen the logan and bear river sites to minimize upstream watershed changes that produce discontinuities or non climate related trends in the observed flow record 5 4 implications for water management the model presented here is the first approach to reconstruct monthly streamflows directly from tree ring chronologies and climate reconstructions without routing climate reconstructions through a hydrologic model with reasonable estimates of monthly flow extending many centuries back in time water managers can challenge systems models with a larger range of natural variability in the duration and severity of drought and pluvial events this could significantly increase the potential for the use of streamflow reconstructions in water management applications permitting better drought vulnerability simulations and more robust optimization of reservoir operations for example engineers are often asked to design systems to address drought events with 100 year return periods in watersheds where the observed flow record is shorter than 100 years extrapolation using extreme value analysis can estimate the magnitude of a hypothetical event but multi century flow reconstructions likely include more useful and realistic scenarios multi year or decadal periods of drought and successive small drought events can challenge water management operations and reservoir recovery in ways that a single severe drought event does not establishing a long catalog of near natural flow is also critical when estimating future hydrologic risks under conditions of a non stationary climate other available methodologies used to reconstruct sub annual streamflows gangopadhyay et al 2015 sauchyn and ilich 2017 do not use tree rings to directly estimate monthly flows instead they generate many feasible sub annual scenarios either by stochastic hydrology sauchyn and ilich 2017 or resampling temperature and precipitation as inputs to a water balance model gangopadhyay et al 2015 these approaches have benefits producing many ensembles to be used for water systems model simulations and ensuring water balance within large watersheds gangopadhyay et al 2015 however they also have several limitations not present in the apr model first by resampling complete water years the number of potential temperature and precipitation time series are limited to the years in the observed record gangopadhyay et al 2015 if this method were applied to the logan and bear rivers there would be 88 and 68 potential annual segments respectively using k 10 nearest neighbor resampling the same years would be repeated across many realizations this ensures realistic years but severely limits variation within the range of observed conditions and prevents reasonable extrapolation slightly outside this range second by requiring a fully developed water balance model this approach limits its applicability to regions that have adequate gauge data and modeling the apr model proposed here has both greater flexibility and lower data requirements avoiding the need for developing a full hydrologic model while also allowing a freer range of flows still constrained by the historical flow distribution the apr model also provides a direct statistical link between tree ring proxies and global circulation drivers that can be used for model validation we assert that the approach outlined here provides several important improvements over the method of gangopadhyay et al 2015 at the same time we note that these two methods are fundamentally different and designed to address different research questions the gangopadhyay et al 2015 method focuses on capturing uncertainty and ranges of potential flow while the apr method proposed here focuses on a single best estimate given the value of monthly streamflow reconstructions for water managers and the potential growth in this new field of research it is important for future studies to test the global applicability of both methods by evaluating their use outside the western u s this study as well as the prior efforts to reconstruct monthly flows has focused on a relatively narrow geographical area of the western u s given the potential value for monthly reconstructions in water resources and the availability of climate sensitive tree ring chronologies elsewhere in the world there is an important opportunity to test whether these approaches can be applied globally 6 conclusions a new framework for generating monthly streamflows directly from annual reconstructions was introduced and demonstrated using two sites in northern utah several potential models were evaluated beginning with a simple monthly flow ratio mf model introducing a link between annual and monthly percentiles ap model allowing lagged annual flows to predict monthly percentiles apr model and ultimately including regional and global indices as regressors apr model with predictors of the different models tested the apr model was shown to successfully reproduce flows across nearly all months and across the entire range of flows this model can be applied using only data from annual flow reconstructions or can incorporate regional tree ring chronologies and global climate index reconstructions adding these additional predictors was shown to improve predictive skill while also providing insight with regard to streamflow drivers more simple model variants were presented as a comparison and to highlight potential modeling challenges such as sudden flow jumps at water year transitions while annual paleostreamflow reconstructions have great potential for use in water resources planning tingstad et al 2014 rice et al 2009 woodhouse and lukas 2006 axelson et al 2009 their annual resolution is a potential limitation monthly reconstructions rather than annual are therefore extremely valuable for drought vulnerability planning this study shows that monthly flow reconstructions are feasible and presents a new model that makes monthly paleostreamflow reconstruction more tractable this will hopefully improve the utility and accessibility of these reconstructions for water managers systems analysts and decision makers acknowledgements this work was funded by utah mineral lease funds this article
