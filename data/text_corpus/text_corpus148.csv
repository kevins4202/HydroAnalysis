740,the accurate modeling of flow and transport in the vadose zone for agricultural and environmental applications requires knowledge about soil parameters soil parameters vary in space depending on soil texture and structure in the present synthetic study we considered spatial variation of permeability k inverse of capillary entry pressure head α vg and exponent n of the mualem van genuchten model the iterative ensemble kalman filter ienkf can estimate the spatially variable soil parameters if measurements of water saturation at different locations and times are available we used as input daily precipitation data from the berambadi catchment southern india we first considered that the parameters vary horizontally but are constant in the vertical direction in this case log k and log α vg can be estimated satisfactorily with 30 40 reduction of rmse compared to open loop runs if the initial guess of the spatial correlation lengths of the heterogeneous fields is equal to or larger than the unknown true values the estimation of exponent n is poorer as the reduction of rmse is just 20 if vertical heterogeneity of the parameters is considered the estimation of log k and log α vg is only improved for the upper 1 5 m and estimation of n is not improved we also demonstrate that the estimation problem can be simplified when flow in the unsaturated zone is predominantly vertical if in this case soil hydraulic parameters are estimated with ienkf at measurement locations and afterwards interpolated with kriging results are produced with a similar quality as with 3d ienkf keywords data assimilation iterative enkf soil hydraulic parameters soil moisture kriging 1 introduction modelling of flow and transport processes in unsaturated porous media is affected by the uncertainty of soil hydraulic parameters like saturated hydraulic conductivity and the mualem van genuchten parameters in order to improve the prediction of fluxes like groundwater recharge and evapotranspiration and the characterization of states like soil moisture content it is important to estimate these unknown parameters including their uncertainty in soil hydrology traditionally inverse modelling techniques are used to estimate unknown parameters overviews can for example be found in vrugt et al 2008 and vereecken et al 2016 if a limited number of soil hydraulic parameters has to be estimated for example for 1d layered models or distributed models with a limited number of soil types markov chain monte carlo mcmc methods are an option e g vrugt et al 2003 and vrugt et al 2009 if a large number of soil hydraulic parameters has to be estimated on a distributed grid sequential data assimilation methods and in particular the ensemble kalman filter burgers et al 1998 are faster alternatives to mcmc a long tradition of the application of data assimilation methods for the estimation of states of the unsaturated zone exists especially in the context of land surface modelling e g reichle et al 2002 in those works only states were updated but not soil hydraulic parameters the earliest works on joint state parameter updating in soil hydrology focused on 1d problems wu and margulis 2011 2013 tested the ensemble kalman filter and montzka et al 2011 2013 the particle filter these studies were oriented towards the real time control of irrigation with treated waste water and the assimilation of remotely sensed soil moisture information respectively and showed promising results other 1d studies were carried out for less favorable conditions like the presence of a structural model error and strongly non gaussian distribution of model states erdal et al 2014 found that in case of an incorrect incorporation of the position of the soil horizons in the model the estimation of the soil hydraulic parameters becomes also biased if together with the model states also a bias term is estimated this can improve the modelling results erdal et al 2015 pointed to the worse performance of the enkf under very dry conditions this bad performance is related to strongly skewed probability density functions for the upper soil layers as pressure can become very negative for some ensemble members whereas for other ensemble members this is much less the case erdal et al 2015 proposed a normal score transformation to alleviate problems with strongly skewed pressure distributions further works that addressed aspects of data assimilation including parameter estimation for 1d layered soil hydrological or land surface models include bauser et al 2016 brandhorst et al 2017 man et al 2017 zheng et al 2017 and zhang et al 2017 2018 the estimation of 2d or 3d distributed fields of soil hydraulic properties with help of sequential data assimilation has also been addressed in some works song et al 2014 estimated saturated hydraulic conductivity with an iterative enkf and considered other soil hydraulic parameters deterministic pasetto et al 2015 restricted their soil hydraulic parameter estimation for an artificial hillslope to saturated hydraulic conductivity and showed that a large number of measurements is needed to estimate the spatially distributed field kurtz et al 2016 also restricted the parameter estimation to saturated hydraulic conductivity and introduced a data assimilation framework that allows to estimate parameters for a large number of grid cells in a very efficient manner shi et al 2014 2015 estimated different parameters of an integrated land surface subsurface model including multiple soil parameters for a synthetic case and the shale hills critical zone observatory they considered spatially homogeneous parameters and did not estimate spatially heterogeneous parameter fields zheng et al 2017 man et al 2017 and ju et al 2018 also assumed given known mualem van genuchten parameters in their 2d unsaturated flow problems botto et al 2018 estimated for an experimental hillslope spatially constant values of not only saturated hydraulic conductivity but also mualem van genuchten parameters they showed that a good performance could be achieved but the estimation of residual soil moisture content and the van genuchten parameter α was more difficult all these papers did not estimate distributed fields of mualem van genuchten parameters and limited the estimation to spatially heterogeneous saturated hydraulic conductivity the novel contribution of this work is the estimation of 3d spatially distributed fields of multiple soil hydraulic parameters in other studies 3d spatially distributed fields of saturated hydraulic conductivity were estimated but not together with other soil hydraulic parameters therefore to the best of our knowledge there was no study to estimate spatial distributions of multiple soil hydraulic parameters for 2d or 3d problems in particular in this work it is tested whether 3d fully distributed fields of saturated hydraulic conductivity and mualem van genuchten parameters can be jointly estimated with the iterative ensemble kalman filter for non linear problems the ensemble kalman filter is affected by inconsistency between updated states and parameters and therefore the iterative ensemble kalman filter was proposed e g gu and oliver 2007 so that updated states and parameters are consistent it is expected that the iterative ensemble kalman filter performs better than the classical ensemble kalman filter the synthetic simulation experiments in this study can be divided into experiments which consider vertically homogeneous media and more challenging cases with vertically heterogeneous media the robustness of the results for the wrong specification of variogram parameters will also be analyzed as in practice variogram parameters are uncertain related to limited information we considered smaller and larger correlation lengths than the true values for generating the initial heterogeneous parameters fields as the 3d estimation problem is very compute intensive it will also be analyzed how well an alternative less compute intensive approach performs in this alternative approach the soil hydraulic parameters are estimated at the measurement locations with 1d iterative enkf and in addition interpolated by kriging 2 ensemble kalman filter the classical kalman filter provides an analytical solution of bayes law under the assumption of linear model dynamics and gaussian distributions of model states the classical kalman filter allows calculating the posterior model covariance matrix directly for the state and possibly parameter estimation of nonlinear model systems the classical kalman filter does not provide an optimal solution the ensemble kalman filter evensen 1994 burgers et al 1998 was developed to achieve a better performance for non linear models and handle large problems with many unknowns enkf estimates the model covariance matrix from a large number of stochastic realizations the stochastic realizations should be generated in such a way that the main sources of uncertainty which affect the model prediction are covered well by the ensemble in subsurface hydrology the uncertainty of hydraulic properties is in general considered to be a dominant source of uncertainty in this work the iterative ensemble kalman filter ienkf was used in order to avoid inconsistencies between updated states and parameters the procedure to perform the iterative restart enkf described below is similar to that discussed by gu and oliver 2007 and hendricks franssen and kinzelbach 2008 in iterative restart enkf the models are evaluated from time t 0 to the current time step t tm using the model parameters as updated in the previous assimilation step t t m 1 hendricks franssen and kinzelbach 2008 song et al 2014 we considered estimation of log k log α vg and nas heterogeneous random fields from vertical soil saturation profiles measured at different locations and time steps these heterogeneous fields were discretized over a computational mesh and stored in the vector p this vector only contains model parameters and not model states the objective is to estimate the vector pfrom dynamically available measurements of soil saturation stored in the vector d the steps in the iterative restart ensemble kalman filter ienkf are 1 to initialize the data assimilation nr stochastic realizations of log k log α vg and nare generated using the k l expansion method the three soil hydraulic parameters are generated in the form of spatially heterogeneous fields and the initial random realizations of the discretized random fields for all parameters are stored in p j 0 y t log k j y t log α v g j y t n j t where j 1 2 3 nr supercript t corresponds to transpose of matrix or vector the method for the

measurement error covariance matrix r m can have differing values but if the same type of measurements with the same measurement technique is used the values are often similar for all diagonal

the localized auto and cross covariance matrices were used to determine the kalman gain in eq 5 3 description of the 3d test case 3 1 numerical set up we considered a synthetic problem to study the ability of ienkf to estimate 3d spatially distributed fields of permeability and mualem van genuchten parameters by assimilating water saturation data measured at various depths the schematic diagram of the computational domain of the synthetic problem is shown in fig 2 the domain is 200 m long in both x and y directions and 7 m deep in the z direction we imposed zero flow at the lateral and bottom boundaries for the top boundary a time varying but spatially uniform recharge was set as boundary condition we assumed that the initial water table depth was 4 m below the ground surface near the ground surface the water saturation was equal to residual saturation but above the groundwater table the saturation due to capillary action was modeled the time varying recharge resulted in dynamic variation of water saturation in the vadose zone for modeling unsaturated flow in the vadose zone the richard s equation is solved 10 ϕ s t q 0 and q k k r w μ p ρ g here s p q ρ and μ are saturation pressure pa the darcy seepage flux m s density kg m3 and viscosity pa s of water respectively the porosity and intrinsic permeability m2 of the porous medium are denoted by ϕ and k respectively t is the time s g is gravitational acceleration m s2 and is the divergence operator the relative permeability krw is a function of water saturation unsaturated flow in the heterogeneous medium was modelled by the fehm code zyvoloski 2007 fehm is a general purpose cvfe control volume finite element simulator for non isothermal single and multi phase flow in porous media the 3d domain was discretized into 26 26 40 grid cells with 27 27 41 nodes we took δx δy 8 m and for vertical directions node spacing was varying near the ground surface δz 0 025 m and gradually increases to δz 0

s r 1 s r the exponents m and n are related according m 1 1 n here α vg is related to the inverse of the air entry pressure head m 1 and sr is residual water saturation it was assumed that the permeability k van genuchten parameters α vg and n vary along horizontal and vertical directions porosity and residual water saturation were considered deterministic and spatially homogeneous with values of 0 3 and 0 05 respectively the simulations were forced by a precipitation time series from the berambadi watershed near gundlupet town in the chamarajanagar district of karnataka state in india 11 45 40 09 n 76 35 16 71 e and 870 m above sea level the watershed area is approximately 100 km2 the watershed is situated in a semi arid climate zone with a mean annual dominant south west monsoon rainfall of 800 mm the precipitation for the period from may to december 2014 is shown in fig 3 for modeling unsaturated flow we specified the vertical flux qz t as shown in red colour in fig 3 3 2 set up of data assimilation experiments in this work it is assumed that both k andα vg follow a lognormal distribution while n follows a normal distribution the spatial correlation of all these parameters is modelled with squared exponential functions see eq a2 the horizontal correlation length λ h of the reference field is 30 m the vertical correlation length λ v is either extremely large resulting in a vertically homogeneous medium effectively a 2d estimation problem or 0 5 m 3d estimation problem in the present set upλ h of the reference parameter fields is approximately four times the grid cell size and for the vertically heterogeneous medium λ v is twice the largest grid cell size in the vertical direction the water saturation values measured at different depths are assimilated weekly in the data assimilation experiments the horizontal locations are shown in fig 4 measurements are taken at a regular grid with xm 80 40 0 40 80 m andym 80 40 0 40 80 m and at different depthszm 0 05 0 1 0 2 0 5 1 0 1 5 2 0 m the measurement error was for all measurements 0 02 cm3 cm3 in the horizontal direction each five grid cells a measurement location is situated in the vertical direction the grid cell sizes and measurement spacing are nonuniform the spacing of measurement points in the vertical direction is at least twice of the grid cell size 3 3 model simulation and method of estimation when the lateral pressure gradient is small in the vadose zone the flow is driven by gravity and the vertical water flux is significantly larger than the horizontal flux especially for models applied at larger scales and without steep slopes water flow is predominantly vertical also a 1d variable saturated flow model may be adequate for determining the time varying water saturation this is further investigated in this work in the first data assimilation approach the 3d unsaturated flow problem is solved for each stochastic realization to predict soil saturation at different observation points before the data assimilation step in the 3d ienkf step the soil hydraulic parameters are updated the second data assimilation approach for estimating the heterogeneous fields consists of two steps i the soil hydraulic parameter values log k log α vg and possibly also n are estimated with ienkf for a soil column based on the soil saturation measured at various depths and times in this case the 1d variably saturated flow problem is solved to determine the water saturation variation with depth and time this has to be repeated for each location where measurements are available the horizontal locations in the present study are shown in fig 4 ii kriging is performed for interpolating the soil hydraulic parameters to the rest of the grid cells to construct a smooth 2d heterogeneous field for this interpolation the same variogram is used as for the equivalent 3d case we denominate this method 1d ienkf kriging for stochastic interpolation we used k l expansion based kriging which was formulated by roy and grilli 1997 the method of k l expansion based kriging is detailed in appendix b 3 4 data assimilation scenarios data assimilation studies for the following set ups were performed the overview of the simulation experiments is given in table 1 i log k and log α vg are spatially heterogeneous in the horizontal directions but homogeneous in the vertical direction in this case the exponent n is constant and known scenarios 2d lxx ndet ol and 2d lxx ndet ienkf where xx is the correlation length see later and ol is open loop and ienkf is data assimilation with iterative ensemble kalman filter ii log k log α vg andnare varying in the horizontal directions but are uniform in the vertical direction in this case spatial variability of nwas also considered the experiment investigates whether the exponent n can be successfully estimated together with log k andlog α vg scenarios 2d l30 ol and 2d l30 ienkf iii log k log α vg andnare varying in horizontal as well as vertical directions this is the most challenging data assimilation parameter estimation problem scenarios 3d lxx lvyy ol and 3d lxx lvyy ienkf where yy is the vertical correlation length the heterogeneous soil hydraulic parameter fields were estimated with ienkf assuming different spatial correlation lengths for the soil hydraulic parameter fields in the horizontal and vertical direction in addition results for the 3d ienkf and 1d ienkf kriging methods were compared simulation scenarios ienkf and ienkf i before carrying out the data assimilation experiments simulations were performed using different values for the covariance localization length c for estimating 2d log k and log α vg fields the data assimilation was done for 800 stochastic realizations these 800 stochastic realizations were generated using different correlation lengths for the soil hydraulic parameters in order to consider uncertainty in the semivariogram parameters 3 5 evaluation performance measures the quality of parameter estimation was analyzed according two different criteria root mean square error rmse and spread the formulae for calculating rmse and spread are 12 rms e y 1 n p i 1 n p y t r u e i y i 2 and sprea d y 1 n p i 1 n p σ y i 2 where np is the length of the array according the discretization of the random parameter fieldy for 2d random fields np 729 and for 3d random fields np 29889 hereycan be log k or log α vg or n the symbols y true i y i and σ y i denote respectively the true value of y the ensemble mean value and the standard deviation of y at the ith node the rmse and spread values for the state variable saturation are calculated according 13 rms e s 1 n n i 1 n n s t r u e i s i s t r u e i 2 and sprea d s 1 n n i 1 n n σ s i s i 2 where nn 29889 the length of the array after discretization of the water saturation field s saturation changes with time and varies strongly as a function of depth therefore a normalization with respect to the true value s true i respectively the ensemble mean s i was made 4 results 4 1 case a estimation of 2d heterogeneous log k log α vg and n fields in this section the results are analyzed for the scenario where log k log α vg and nare spatially heterogeneous but uniform in the vertical direction the reference log k log α vg and nfields are shown in fig 5 these true heterogeneous fields were generated using the k l expansion method see appendix a the statistical parameters of the reference permeability and van genuchten parameter fields are given in table 2 in the experiments soil saturation values were assimilated weekly by ienkf for 25 locations 7 depths the ensemble mean fields of the estimated parameters are calculated over the 800 stochastic realizations we discuss first results for data assimilation experiments with heterogeneous and unknown log k and log α vg fields and known n with value 2 5 the experiments to estimate log k and log α vg fields by 3d ienkf and 1d ienkf kriging methods considering different initial correlation length λ h were repeated for two different sets of reference fields 4 1 1 estimation by 3d ienkf method the estimations were performed for damping factor ε 0 1 in eq 4 first tests were made for different values of the localization length scale c rmse and spread after 20 data assimilation steps for the 2d log k and log α vg fields for different covariance localization length scales c are given in table 3 a value of c 50 m was selected for the rest of the experiments given a good performance fig 6 shows the estimated ensemble mean 2d heterogeneous log k and log α vg fields for the first reference field after 20 weeks of data assimilation and for λ h 30 m 15 m and 50 m to generate initial heterogeneous fields the estimated log k and log α vg fields are quite close to the true reference fields see fig 5 when λ h 30 m or 50 m scenarios 2d l30 ndet ienkf and 2d l50 ndet ienkf fig 6 shows that estimation is poorer when the small correlation length 15 m is used the rmse and spread of log k and log α vg after the 20th data assimilation step are given in table 4 the simulations were continued for 3 more weeks after completing data assimilation steps the values of rmse and spread of saturation after 23 weeks are given in table 4 it was done to asses the accuracy of future state estimation with the prior estimated parameters tables 4 shows that rmse and spread have similar values which illustrates that the ensemble calculations are not affected by filter inbreeding the underestimation of variance hendricks franssen and kinzelbach 2008 a too strong decrease of the spread associated with an underestimation of the model error variance is a common problem in data assimilation for λ h 30m the rmse for the soil hydraulic parameters decreased by 36 log k and 31 log α vg compared to the open loop run the rmse and spread stopped to decrease after the 20th data assimilation step the rmse of saturation calculated over the entire domain after 23 weeks of simulation decreased by 32 related to data assimilation also for saturation the spread decreased in the same amount as the rmse the rmse and spread of saturation calculated at the measurement points decreased to 21 and 31 respectively of the original values in case of smaller initial correlation length λ h 15 m scenario 2d l15 ndet ienkf rmse and spread for both log k and log α vg decreased by only 19 and 18 respectively this illustrates that related to the too small correlation length of the soil hydraulic parameters the information content of the observations could not be used completely so that the characterization of the parameter fields improved less than for the correct correlation length λ h 30 m for λ h 50 m scenario 2d l50 ndet ienkf both rmse and spread of the soil hydraulic parameters were lower than for λ h 30 m although the correlation length is overestimated now the reason could be that updating the parameter fields with a too long correlation length results in a more smoothed field as the rmse penalizes larger deviations much stronger squared deviations than smaller deviations a smoother field has the advantage that compared to the true reference field large outliers resulting in large contributions to rmse are avoided in addition in the case of too long correlation lengths it is also possible that updates which would potentially go in the wrong direction are corrected by other measurement points which are located closer to the grid cell to be updated it can also be observed that for λ h 50 m the spread decreases more than the rmse especially for soil saturation which is indicative of model variance underestimation and filter inbreeding therefore although the rmse s are slightly smaller for λ h 50 m than for λ h 30 m the spread values indicate that the quality of the updated ensemble of soil hydraulic parameter fields is not necessarily better now if the correlation length is further increased λ h 80 m scenario 2d l80 ndet ienkf and deviates more from the true value the rmse s of the soil hydraulic parameter fields do not decrease further but are still slightly smaller than for λ h 30 m the spread further decreases and is now indicative of a strong underestimation of the model error variance we repeated the same set of experiments for a 2nd reference field as shown in fig 5 the values of rmse and spread are given in table 5 the decrease of rmse and spread for log k log α vg and s are of the same order of magnitude as for the 1st set of reference fields for the true correlation length λ h 30m and also correlation lengths of 15 m and 50 m this implies that rmse s are also for the 2nd set of reference fields slightly lower for λ h 50 m than for λ h 30 m the underestimation of spread can again be observed for λ h 50 m for the 2nd reference field results for λ h 80 m are much worse than for the 1st reference field the overestimation of the correlation length not only results in too narrow spread now but also in a strong rmse increase of the soil hydraulic parameter fields from these results it can be concluded that the characterization of parameters and states is impacted in a different way if λ h is too small or too large a too small λ h results in larger rmse than for the correct λ h whereas a too large λ h causes an underestimation of the model error variance but did not result in larger rmse and even slightly smaller rmse than for the true correlation length 4 1 2 estimation by 1dienkf kriging method we also used 1d ienkf kriging to estimate 2d log k and log α vg fields for different spatial correlation length parameters scenarios 2d lxx ndet ienkf i fig 7 shows the estimated 2d log k andlog α vg fields using this alternative and fast approach it shows that the estimates for λ h 30 m scenario 2d l30 ndet ienkf i are as good as the ones by 3d ienkf the rmse and spread for log k and log α vg are even slightly smaller than those for 3d ienkf see table 4 for λ h 15 m scenario 2d l15 ndet ienkf i the estimated log k and log α vg fields are shown in fig 7 the influence of singular measurements can be easily detected from the figure in the form of circular patches low and high parameter values around the measurement location the estimated fields by 3d ienkf shown in fig 6 for λ h 15 m also show small circular patches with high and low parameter values but the results show spatial patterns more in correspondence with the reference field nevertheless the 1d ienkf kriging approach results in slightly smaller rmse and spread for λ h 15 m than 3d ienkf see table 4 in spite of the fact that it produces more artificial maps less in correspondence with the spatial patterns of the reference parameter fields than 3d ienkf the estimated ensemble fields for λ h 50 m by 1d ienkf kriging scenario 2d l50 ndet ienkf i are very close to those estimated by 3d ienkf for λ h 50 m the rmse values for the 1d ienkf kriging are smaller than the ones for 3d ienkf for λ h 50 m but for λ h 80 m scenario 2d l80 ndet ienkf i 3d ienkf clearly outperforms 1d ienkf kriging for the 2nd set of reference fields see fig 5 the rmse and spread values for the 1d ienkf kriging method are smaller than the ones for 3d ienkf for λ h 30 15 and 50 m see table 5 also for the 2nd set of reference fields results are very bad for λ h 80 m and even clearly worse than for 3d ienkf apparently 1d ienkf kriging is a fast and accurate alternative to 3d ienkf but is more affected by errors in the spatial correlation length of soil hydraulic parameters 4 1 3 estimation of 2d heterogeneous log k log α vg and n fields in the previous section the results for constant and known n were discussed in this section the results are presented for the case that all three parameters k α vg and n are spatially heterogeneous these experiments were only performed for 3d ienkf and not for 1d ienkf kriging we assumed a normal distribution for n with mean standard deviation and correlation length equal to μ n 2 5 σ n 0 2 and λ h 30 m for the purpose of a better comparison the true log k and log α vg fields were the same ones as used in the data assimilation experiments with constant and known n the estimated log k log α vg and nfields by the 3d ienkf method are shown in fig 8 the values of rmse and spread are given in table 6 in this case the correlation lengths of the soil hydraulic parameters were equal to the reference ones λ h 30 m scenario 2d l30 ienkf the results illustrate that the estimates of log k and log α vg are not affected by the uncertainty and spatial variability of n the n field is estimated with a decrease of the rmse by 20 after 20 data assimilation steps the additional uncertainty of ndoes not worsen the estimation of the model states the estimation of the model states is very similar for the cases with a deterministic homogeneousn and a stochastic heterogeneous n in summary the information content of the observations is large enough to improve the characterization of the three soil hydraulic parameters jointly 4 2 case b estimation of 3d heterogeneous log k log α vg and n fields in a next step the synthetic estimation problem was made more realistic by imposing a vertical correlation length λ v for the 3d heterogeneous reference fields of log k log α vg andnof 0 5 m so that vertical heterogeneity was introduced the horizontal correlation length λ h was 30 m the spatial distribution of the reference parameter fields at the land surface and at 1 5 m depth are shown in fig 9 similar to the results in section 4 1 we have compared the estimation of 3d parameter fields considering different guesses of the initial horizontal correlations lengths 4 2 1 estimation by 3d ienkf first results are discussed for the case that the correlation lengths used to generate the initial parameter fields are equal to the values for the reference fields λ h 30m scenario 3d l30 lv0 5 ienkf the estimated heterogeneous parameter fields at the land surface and at 1 5 m depth are shown in fig 10 the most important observation is that the estimated log k and log α vg fields at the land surface and at 1 5 m depth are closer to the reference while the estimated nfields differ strongly from the true n field for the 3d ensemble mean fields the rmse and spread at each depth below the ground surface were calculated fig 11 shows the variation of rmse and spread as function of depth in the soil profile z the decrease of rmse and spread values related to data assimilation is obvious however the rmse fluctuations in the vertical direction are significantly larger than the fluctuations in spread these fluctuations are not an artifact of the data assimilation as the rmse fluctuations in the vertical direction are also found for the open loop run the reason behind it may be that for the 3d true parameters fields the spatial horizontal average of parameters is not uniform but varies as a function of depth on the other hand the uniform profiles of spread for the open loop simulation confirm that the number of realizations 800 in the present study is sufficient the average values of rmse and spread from the land surface to 1 5 m depth are given in table 7 for both soil hydraulic parameters and saturation the rmse of log k and log α vg for the top 1 5 m reduced by 19 compared to the open loop run while the rmse of the n field was the same as for the open loop run fig 11 shows that the rmse values for log k and log α vg are close to 0 6 and 0 8 respectively near the ground surface and especially log α vg increases for depths below 1 5 m which is related to the more limited impact of the measurement data at this depth the spread shows a similar trend this can be explained by the slower changes of water saturation at deeper layers so that less information gain from measurements can be expected in addition water saturation in the deeper layers is also less sensitive to the measured saturation values because the measurements are situated further away and are less dense here the plots illustrate that the estimation of n does not improve the rmse for n is close to its prior standard deviation σ n 0 2 apparently the measurements do not contain enough information now to improve the characterization of all three soil hydraulic parameters as the smaller vertical correlation length limits the influence of the measurements the performance of 3d ienkf was also tested for λ h which differed from the true values we simulated the following four cases including smaller and larger correlation lengths than the reference along both horizontal and vertical directions i λ h 15 m λ v 0 5 m scenario 3d l15 lv0 5 ienkf ii λ h 50 m λ v 0 5 m scenario 3d l50 lv0 5 ienkf iii λ h 30 m λ v 1 0 m scenario 3d l30 lv1 0 ienkf and iv λ h 30 m λ v 0 3 m scenario 3d l15 lv0 3 ienkf the rmse and spread of the soil hydraulic parameters for these cases are also shown in fig 11 in all cases log k and log α vg are estimated better than n in terms of a relative improvement compared to the open loop run between the ground surface and z 1 5 m the rmse of log k and log α vg is close to 0 8 but log α vg increases below 1 5 m the estimated fields using a wrong correlation length give similar rmse and spread values as simulations with the correct correlation length except for the smaller horizontal correlation length λ h 15 m for λ h 15 m rmse and spread were larger again indicating that a too small correlation length compared to the true value results in a worse characterization of soil hydraulic parameters and states a misspecification of the vertical correlation length resulted in larger rmse for log α vg both in case of an underestimation as well as overestimation while the rmse for the other soil hydraulic parameters was similar and the rmse for soil saturation was only slightly higher these results point in general to a certain robustness of the method for errors in the correlation length of the parameters although errors in the specification of these correlation lengths have a certain negative impact 4 2 2 estimation by 1d ienkf kriging method we also estimated 3d fields of the three parameters using 1d ienkf kriging in this case λ h 30 m λ v 0 5 m was used same as true fields for interpolation by kriging scenario 3d l30 lv0 5 ienkf i estimated parameter fields are shown in fig 12 the rmse and spread as function of depth for each of the three parameters are shown in fig 11 for comparison with the 3d ienkf method the estimated ensemble mean fields displayed in fig 12 have slightly larger rmse values than the ones estimated by 3d ienkf in case of 3d heterogeneous parameter fields 1d ienkf kriging performs slightly worse than 3d ienkf to estimate parameters and states a plausible explanation is that in case of spatially varying permeability and other soil hydraulic parameters the vertical flux varies as function of x and y this may create pressure gradients in the horizontal direction and induce horizontal water flow as argued before the vertical water flow is dominant in this problem and in reality also at larger spatial scales and in the absence of steep slopes but for the 3d setup and the additional heterogeneity it is expected that horizontal flow plays a larger role 5 discussion the synthetic simulation experiments show that it is possible to jointly estimate spatially heterogeneous fields of permeability and mualem van genuchten parameters and improve the characterization of each of the three parameters this was achieved with an iterative ensemble kalman filter approach which guarantees a consistency between estimated states and parameters during the complete simulation period although the rmse of the ensemble mean parameter fields did not decrease so much compared to the open loop run in the simulation experiments often between 30 and 40 the spatial distributions of the estimated parameter fields show a high correspondence with the reference fields this points to the fact that the main structure of the parameter fields could be identified but small scale variations were not captured very well the success of the approach depends strongly on the horizontal correlation length of the soil hydraulic parameters versus the spacing between the measurement points a further complication is that little is known about the horizontal correlation structure of the van genuchten parameters as this has not been widely studied in the literature yet in this work a similar geostatistical model for the spatial variability of the van genuchten parameters has been adopted as for permeability which seems a reasonable assumption but which is less pinned by observational evidence if the distance between the measurement points is much larger than the correlation length the characterization of the soil hydraulic parameters for large parts of the simulation domain will not improve as the flow is normally vertically oriented so that the horizontal correlations of saturation content and pressure are also limited as dense networks of soil moisture sensors are only available in rare cases the 3d characterization of soil hydraulic parameters will only be meaningful for relatively small sites which have such dense observation networks this is typically the case at the field scale also the vertical correlation length plays an important role according the simulation experiments for a successful 3d characterization of soil hydraulic parameters it is important to have good prior information on the presence of soil horizons and sufficient dense observations of soil moisture with measurement data for each soil horizon as a consequence in practice the 3d characterization of spatially variable soil hydraulic parameters with data assimilation will remain very challenging in this work uncertainty of meteorological forcings was neglected which is another factor which will have contributed to more positive results in this study than can be expected under real world conditions the uncertainty of meteorological conditions was neglected as we wanted to focus on the feasibility to estimate 3d spatially distributed fields of multiple soil hydraulic parameters we therefore assumed that there was a meteorological station at site so that uncertainty is small however this is not always the case and typically for larger scale studies the uncertainty of meteorological forcings might play an important role and impede the reliable estimation of soil hydraulic parameters from soil saturation or soil moisture measurements the spatial variability of infiltration rate was not considered in this study the infiltration rate may vary spatially due to permeability and soil moisture variability of the top soil layer however we expect that at larger scales as imposed in this study horizontal redistribution of water is limited as the flow is predominantly gravity dominated we believe that this is a realistic condition as redistribution of infiltrating water related to ponding and surface runoff often plays a limited role in areas without steeper slopes especially at larger scales at the field scale spatially variable infiltration rates play an important role but we believe that the results of our study are not much affected by neglecting this process and expect that after infiltration the water flux in the unsaturated zone is also in this case predominantly vertical and gravity driven in this work it was assumed that permeability and the mualem van genuchten parameters were not correlated in practice however the parameters are correlated this correlation could for example be taken into account by the values provided by carsel and parish 1988 including information on the correlation between parameters will improve the characterization of the soil hydraulic parameters as the number of independent parameters to be estimated will be smaller therefore our simulation experiments present a pessimistic lower bound case of the expected improvement in the characterization of spatially variable fields of soil hydraulic parameters by data assimilation if the rest of the settings would be the same as in this study the data assimilation approach which was followed in this work guarantees a consistency between soil hydraulic parameters and states during the complete data assimilation process but is associated with additional computational costs compared to the classical ensemble kalman filter approach we assume that also in real world cases the values for the estimated soil hydraulic parameters stabilize over time so that after a number of updates the parameter updating can be stopped in this work 20 parameter updates were sufficient in practice for real time applications from that point onwards simulations could be continued with the estimated parameter values and data assimilation could be applied to only update states although the methodology followed here guarantees consistency between states and parameters the updating step itself is affected by linearizing over the ensemble the relation between measurements and model parameters therefore data assimilation approaches which can deal better with these non linearities are expected to give better results but currently particle filter approaches are not very efficient for 3d parameter estimation the particle filter can however be used for 1d parameter estimation and our simulations show that the subsequent interpolation of the estimated parameters by kriging can yield results which are close to a full 3d inversion however if horizontal flow plays a more important role it is expected that these two approaches 3d estimation versus 1d estimation plus kriging will show larger differences this could for example be the case for steeper slopes we are currently investigating under which conditions the 1d estimation plus kriging still provides good results for example as function of the steepness of slope 6 conclusions in this study different soil hydraulic parameters such as log transformed permeability log k the logarithm of the inverse capillary entry pressure log α vg and the exponent n of the mualem van genuchten model were estimated by assimilating time series of soil saturation data with the iterative ensemble kalman filter approach in a synthetic experiment the parameter estimation was tested for both 2d and 3d heterogeneous soil hydraulic parameter fields and for different initial guesses of the correlation length parameter of the semivariogram results for the 2d case showed that the characterization of the ensemble mean log k and log α vg fields improved considerably with 30 40 rmse reduction compared to the open loop run if also n is uncertain we found that the estimation of the n field did not improve as much 20 as the log k and log α vg fields it was also observed that considering n as unknown and variable does not affect the quality of the estimation of log k and log α vg this result shows that for the 2d case the three spatially heterogeneous fields of soil hydraulic parameters could be estimated successfully together if the estimation is based on a too small correlation length the characterization of the spatially variable soil hydraulic parameter fields is clearly worse compared to the case where the true correlation length is used but if the estimation is based on a too large correlation length the characterization of the soil hydraulic parameter fields is in general not worse but the model variance is underestimated in those cases we considered also fully 3d heterogeneous cases with a vertical correlation length of 0 5 m the improvement in the characterization of log k and log α vg expressed in terms of rmse reduction compared with the open loop for the case with vertical heterogeneity was around 20 now and the rmse for the estimation of the n field was the same as for the open loop run this shows that for the fully 3d heterogeneous case the estimation of spatially variable parameter fields is more challenging given the reduced information content of the measurements but still some improvement in the characterization of the ensemble mean soil hydraulic parameter fields is possible we evaluated also an alternative method 1d ienkf kriging for estimating soil hydraulic parameters from soil saturation time series recorded during infiltration experiments since the water flow in the vadose zone is predominantly vertical the vertical profiles of the three parameters log k log α vg and n were estimated for the different soil columns corresponding to the different measurement locations kriging was used to construct a 3d field of the estimated parameters this method is very efficient as only 1d model simulations need to be performed the results were very close to the ones obtained for 3d simulations without significant lateral water flow 1d ienkf kriging can be used as an efficient alternative approach for estimation of soil hydraulic parameter fields however the approach is more sensitive to misspecification of the parameter correlation lengths these results show the feasibility of estimating 3d spatially distributed fields of soil hydraulic parameters but results are strongly affected by the horizontal correlation of the soil hydraulic parameters in comparison to the distance between monitoring locations in many real world cases few monitoring locations are available and the correlation distance of soil hydraulic parameters is relatively small therefore improved characterization of 3d fields of soil hydraulic parameters by assimilating soil moisture data is likely limited to intensively monitored field sites acknowledgements the first author is grateful to

generation using k l expansion to generate the ensemble of heterogeneous fields we adopted the karhunen loeve k l expansion method ghanem and spanos 1991 li and zhang 2007 a brief description of the k

correspond to the ith eigenvalue and eigenfunction of the spatial correlation function of r x x here xand x denote the coordinate vectors of two arbitrary points in space in this study we have considered that the heterogeneous parameter field follows a squared exponential correlation function a2 r x x exp x x 2 2 λ 2 x y y 2 2 λ 2 y z z 2 2 λ 2 z where λ x λ y and λ z are respectively the spatial correlation length in x y and z directions most often the eigenvalues and eigenfunctions cannot be derived analytically for the given spatial correlation function but it is very easy to find these in discrete form as the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the correlation matrix for a given computational domain if r is the correlation matrix obtained from eq a2 for the discretized random field and f i is the eigenvector they satisfy the following equation a3 r λ i i f i 0 the number of eigenvalues and eigenvectors obtained from eq a3 is the same as the size of the square and symmetric correlation matrix np however the number of eigenmodes n used to generate the random field is much smaller than the size of the matrix as the eigenvalues associated with the higher eigenmodes are very small in general the value of n should be large if λ l is small where λ is the correlation length and l is size of the domain in the same direction the accuracy of the series expansion in eq a1 can be

740,the accurate modeling of flow and transport in the vadose zone for agricultural and environmental applications requires knowledge about soil parameters soil parameters vary in space depending on soil texture and structure in the present synthetic study we considered spatial variation of permeability k inverse of capillary entry pressure head α vg and exponent n of the mualem van genuchten model the iterative ensemble kalman filter ienkf can estimate the spatially variable soil parameters if measurements of water saturation at different locations and times are available we used as input daily precipitation data from the berambadi catchment southern india we first considered that the parameters vary horizontally but are constant in the vertical direction in this case log k and log α vg can be estimated satisfactorily with 30 40 reduction of rmse compared to open loop runs if the initial guess of the spatial correlation lengths of the heterogeneous fields is equal to or larger than the unknown true values the estimation of exponent n is poorer as the reduction of rmse is just 20 if vertical heterogeneity of the parameters is considered the estimation of log k and log α vg is only improved for the upper 1 5 m and estimation of n is not improved we also demonstrate that the estimation problem can be simplified when flow in the unsaturated zone is predominantly vertical if in this case soil hydraulic parameters are estimated with ienkf at measurement locations and afterwards interpolated with kriging results are produced with a similar quality as with 3d ienkf keywords data assimilation iterative enkf soil hydraulic parameters soil moisture kriging 1 introduction modelling of flow and transport processes in unsaturated porous media is affected by the uncertainty of soil hydraulic parameters like saturated hydraulic conductivity and the mualem van genuchten parameters in order to improve the prediction of fluxes like groundwater recharge and evapotranspiration and the characterization of states like soil moisture content it is important to estimate these unknown parameters including their uncertainty in soil hydrology traditionally inverse modelling techniques are used to estimate unknown parameters overviews can for example be found in vrugt et al 2008 and vereecken et al 2016 if a limited number of soil hydraulic parameters has to be estimated for example for 1d layered models or distributed models with a limited number of soil types markov chain monte carlo mcmc methods are an option e g vrugt et al 2003 and vrugt et al 2009 if a large number of soil hydraulic parameters has to be estimated on a distributed grid sequential data assimilation methods and in particular the ensemble kalman filter burgers et al 1998 are faster alternatives to mcmc a long tradition of the application of data assimilation methods for the estimation of states of the unsaturated zone exists especially in the context of land surface modelling e g reichle et al 2002 in those works only states were updated but not soil hydraulic parameters the earliest works on joint state parameter updating in soil hydrology focused on 1d problems wu and margulis 2011 2013 tested the ensemble kalman filter and montzka et al 2011 2013 the particle filter these studies were oriented towards the real time control of irrigation with treated waste water and the assimilation of remotely sensed soil moisture information respectively and showed promising results other 1d studies were carried out for less favorable conditions like the presence of a structural model error and strongly non gaussian distribution of model states erdal et al 2014 found that in case of an incorrect incorporation of the position of the soil horizons in the model the estimation of the soil hydraulic parameters becomes also biased if together with the model states also a bias term is estimated this can improve the modelling results erdal et al 2015 pointed to the worse performance of the enkf under very dry conditions this bad performance is related to strongly skewed probability density functions for the upper soil layers as pressure can become very negative for some ensemble members whereas for other ensemble members this is much less the case erdal et al 2015 proposed a normal score transformation to alleviate problems with strongly skewed pressure distributions further works that addressed aspects of data assimilation including parameter estimation for 1d layered soil hydrological or land surface models include bauser et al 2016 brandhorst et al 2017 man et al 2017 zheng et al 2017 and zhang et al 2017 2018 the estimation of 2d or 3d distributed fields of soil hydraulic properties with help of sequential data assimilation has also been addressed in some works song et al 2014 estimated saturated hydraulic conductivity with an iterative enkf and considered other soil hydraulic parameters deterministic pasetto et al 2015 restricted their soil hydraulic parameter estimation for an artificial hillslope to saturated hydraulic conductivity and showed that a large number of measurements is needed to estimate the spatially distributed field kurtz et al 2016 also restricted the parameter estimation to saturated hydraulic conductivity and introduced a data assimilation framework that allows to estimate parameters for a large number of grid cells in a very efficient manner shi et al 2014 2015 estimated different parameters of an integrated land surface subsurface model including multiple soil parameters for a synthetic case and the shale hills critical zone observatory they considered spatially homogeneous parameters and did not estimate spatially heterogeneous parameter fields zheng et al 2017 man et al 2017 and ju et al 2018 also assumed given known mualem van genuchten parameters in their 2d unsaturated flow problems botto et al 2018 estimated for an experimental hillslope spatially constant values of not only saturated hydraulic conductivity but also mualem van genuchten parameters they showed that a good performance could be achieved but the estimation of residual soil moisture content and the van genuchten parameter α was more difficult all these papers did not estimate distributed fields of mualem van genuchten parameters and limited the estimation to spatially heterogeneous saturated hydraulic conductivity the novel contribution of this work is the estimation of 3d spatially distributed fields of multiple soil hydraulic parameters in other studies 3d spatially distributed fields of saturated hydraulic conductivity were estimated but not together with other soil hydraulic parameters therefore to the best of our knowledge there was no study to estimate spatial distributions of multiple soil hydraulic parameters for 2d or 3d problems in particular in this work it is tested whether 3d fully distributed fields of saturated hydraulic conductivity and mualem van genuchten parameters can be jointly estimated with the iterative ensemble kalman filter for non linear problems the ensemble kalman filter is affected by inconsistency between updated states and parameters and therefore the iterative ensemble kalman filter was proposed e g gu and oliver 2007 so that updated states and parameters are consistent it is expected that the iterative ensemble kalman filter performs better than the classical ensemble kalman filter the synthetic simulation experiments in this study can be divided into experiments which consider vertically homogeneous media and more challenging cases with vertically heterogeneous media the robustness of the results for the wrong specification of variogram parameters will also be analyzed as in practice variogram parameters are uncertain related to limited information we considered smaller and larger correlation lengths than the true values for generating the initial heterogeneous parameters fields as the 3d estimation problem is very compute intensive it will also be analyzed how well an alternative less compute intensive approach performs in this alternative approach the soil hydraulic parameters are estimated at the measurement locations with 1d iterative enkf and in addition interpolated by kriging 2 ensemble kalman filter the classical kalman filter provides an analytical solution of bayes law under the assumption of linear model dynamics and gaussian distributions of model states the classical kalman filter allows calculating the posterior model covariance matrix directly for the state and possibly parameter estimation of nonlinear model systems the classical kalman filter does not provide an optimal solution the ensemble kalman filter evensen 1994 burgers et al 1998 was developed to achieve a better performance for non linear models and handle large problems with many unknowns enkf estimates the model covariance matrix from a large number of stochastic realizations the stochastic realizations should be generated in such a way that the main sources of uncertainty which affect the model prediction are covered well by the ensemble in subsurface hydrology the uncertainty of hydraulic properties is in general considered to be a dominant source of uncertainty in this work the iterative ensemble kalman filter ienkf was used in order to avoid inconsistencies between updated states and parameters the procedure to perform the iterative restart enkf described below is similar to that discussed by gu and oliver 2007 and hendricks franssen and kinzelbach 2008 in iterative restart enkf the models are evaluated from time t 0 to the current time step t tm using the model parameters as updated in the previous assimilation step t t m 1 hendricks franssen and kinzelbach 2008 song et al 2014 we considered estimation of log k log α vg and nas heterogeneous random fields from vertical soil saturation profiles measured at different locations and time steps these heterogeneous fields were discretized over a computational mesh and stored in the vector p this vector only contains model parameters and not model states the objective is to estimate the vector pfrom dynamically

the localized auto and cross covariance matrices were used to determine the kalman gain in eq 5 3 description of the 3d test case 3 1 numerical set up we considered a synthetic problem to study the ability of ienkf to estimate 3d spatially distributed fields of permeability and mualem van genuchten parameters by assimilating water saturation data measured at various depths the schematic diagram of the computational domain of the synthetic problem is shown in fig 2 the domain is 200 m long in both x and y directions and 7 m deep in the z direction we imposed zero flow at the lateral and bottom boundaries for the top boundary a time varying but spatially uniform recharge was set as boundary condition we assumed that the initial water table depth was 4 m below the ground surface near the ground surface the water saturation was equal to residual saturation but above the groundwater table the saturation due to capillary action was modeled the time varying recharge resulted in

medium was modelled by the fehm code zyvoloski 2007 fehm is a general purpose cvfe control volume finite element simulator for non isothermal single and multi phase flow in porous media the 3d domain was discretized into 26 26 40 grid cells with 27 27 41 nodes we took δx δy 8 m and for vertical directions node spacing was varying near the ground surface δz 0 025 m and gradually increases to δz 0

permeability k van genuchten parameters α vg and n vary along horizontal and vertical directions porosity and residual water saturation were considered deterministic and spatially homogeneous with values of 0 3 and 0 05 respectively the simulations were forced by a precipitation time series from the berambadi watershed near gundlupet town in the chamarajanagar district of karnataka state in india 11 45 40 09 n 76 35 16 71 e and 870 m above sea level the watershed area is approximately 100 km2 the watershed is situated in a semi arid climate zone with a mean annual dominant south west monsoon rainfall of 800 mm the precipitation for the period from may to december 2014 is shown in fig 3 for modeling unsaturated flow we specified the vertical flux qz t as shown in red colour in fig 3 3 2 set up of data assimilation experiments in this work it is assumed that both k andα vg follow a lognormal distribution while n follows a normal distribution the spatial correlation of all these parameters is modelled with squared exponential functions see eq a2 the horizontal correlation length λ h of the reference field is 30 m the vertical correlation length λ v is either extremely large resulting in a vertically homogeneous medium effectively a 2d estimation problem or 0 5 m 3d estimation problem in the present set upλ h of the reference parameter fields is approximately four times the grid cell size and for the vertically heterogeneous medium λ v is twice the largest grid cell size in the vertical direction the water saturation values measured at different depths are assimilated weekly in the data assimilation experiments the horizontal locations are shown in fig 4 measurements are taken at a regular grid with xm 80 40 0 40 80 m andym 80 40 0 40 80 m and at

vertical direction the grid cell sizes and measurement spacing are nonuniform the spacing of measurement points in the vertical direction is at least twice of the grid cell size 3 3 model simulation and method of estimation when the lateral pressure gradient is small in the vadose zone the flow is driven by gravity and the vertical water flux is significantly larger than the horizontal flux especially for models applied at larger scales and without steep slopes water flow is predominantly vertical also a 1d variable saturated flow model may be adequate for determining the time varying water saturation this is further investigated in this work in the first data assimilation approach the 3d unsaturated flow problem is solved for each stochastic realization to predict soil saturation at different observation points before the data assimilation step in the 3d ienkf step the soil hydraulic parameters are updated the second data assimilation approach for estimating the heterogeneous fields consists of two steps i the soil hydraulic parameter values log k log α vg and possibly also n are estimated with ienkf for a soil column based on the soil saturation measured at various depths and times in this case the 1d variably saturated flow problem is solved to determine the water saturation variation with depth and time this has to be repeated for each location where measurements are available the horizontal locations in the present study are shown in fig 4 ii kriging is performed for interpolating the soil hydraulic parameters to the rest of the grid cells to construct a smooth 2d heterogeneous field for this interpolation the same variogram is used as for the equivalent 3d case we denominate this method 1d ienkf kriging for stochastic interpolation we used k l expansion based kriging which was formulated by roy and grilli 1997 the method of k l expansion based kriging is detailed in appendix b 3 4 data assimilation scenarios data assimilation studies for the following set ups were performed the overview of the simulation experiments is given in table 1 i log k and log α vg are spatially heterogeneous in the horizontal directions but homogeneous in the vertical direction in this case the exponent n is constant and known scenarios 2d lxx ndet ol and 2d lxx ndet ienkf where xx is the correlation length see later and ol is open loop and ienkf is data assimilation with iterative ensemble kalman filter ii log k log α vg andnare varying in the horizontal directions but are uniform in the vertical direction in this case spatial variability of nwas also considered the experiment investigates whether the exponent n can be successfully estimated together with log k andlog α vg scenarios 2d l30 ol and 2d l30 ienkf iii log k log α vg andnare varying in horizontal as well as vertical directions this is the most challenging data assimilation parameter estimation problem scenarios 3d lxx lvyy ol and 3d lxx lvyy ienkf where yy is the vertical correlation length the heterogeneous soil hydraulic parameter fields were estimated with ienkf assuming different spatial correlation lengths for the soil hydraulic parameter fields in the horizontal and vertical direction in addition results for the 3d ienkf and 1d ienkf kriging methods were compared simulation scenarios ienkf and ienkf i before carrying out the data assimilation experiments simulations were performed using different values for the covariance localization length c for estimating 2d log k and log α vg fields the data assimilation was done for 800 stochastic realizations these 800 stochastic realizations were generated using different correlation lengths for the soil hydraulic parameters in order to consider uncertainty in the semivariogram parameters 3 5 evaluation

scenario where log k log α vg and nare spatially heterogeneous but uniform in the vertical direction the reference log k log α vg and nfields are shown in fig 5 these true heterogeneous fields were generated using the k l expansion method see appendix a the statistical parameters of the reference permeability and van genuchten parameter fields are given in table 2 in the experiments soil saturation values were assimilated weekly by ienkf for 25 locations 7 depths the ensemble mean fields of the estimated parameters are calculated over the 800 stochastic realizations we discuss first results for data assimilation experiments with heterogeneous and unknown log k and log α vg fields and known n with value 2 5 the experiments to estimate log k and log α vg fields by 3d ienkf and 1d ienkf kriging methods considering different initial correlation length λ h were repeated for two different sets of reference fields 4 1 1 estimation by 3d ienkf method the estimations were performed for damping factor ε 0 1 in eq 4 first tests were made for different values of the localization length scale c rmse and spread after 20 data assimilation steps for the 2d log k and log α vg fields for different covariance localization length scales c are given in table 3 a value of c 50 m was selected for the rest of the experiments given a good performance fig 6 shows the estimated ensemble mean 2d heterogeneous log k and log α vg fields for the first reference field after 20 weeks of data assimilation and for λ h 30 m 15 m and 50 m to generate initial heterogeneous fields the estimated log k and log α vg fields are quite close to the true reference fields see fig 5 when λ h 30 m or 50 m scenarios 2d l30 ndet ienkf and 2d l50 ndet ienkf fig 6 shows that estimation is poorer when the small correlation length 15 m is used the rmse and spread of log k and log α vg after the 20th data assimilation step are given in table 4 the simulations were continued for 3 more weeks after completing data assimilation steps the values of rmse and spread of saturation after 23 weeks are given in table 4 it was done to asses the accuracy of future state estimation with the prior estimated parameters tables 4 shows that rmse and spread have similar values which illustrates that the ensemble calculations are not affected by filter inbreeding the underestimation of variance hendricks franssen and kinzelbach 2008 a too strong decrease of the spread associated with an underestimation of the model error variance is a common problem in data assimilation for λ h 30m the rmse for the soil hydraulic parameters decreased by 36 log k and 31 log α vg compared to the open loop run the rmse and spread stopped to decrease after the 20th data assimilation step the rmse of saturation calculated over the entire domain after 23 weeks of simulation decreased by 32 related to data assimilation also for saturation the spread decreased in the same amount as the rmse the rmse and spread of saturation calculated at the measurement points decreased to 21 and 31 respectively of the original values in case of smaller initial correlation length λ h 15 m scenario 2d l15 ndet ienkf rmse and spread for both log k and log α vg decreased by only 19 and 18 respectively this illustrates that related to the too small correlation length of the soil hydraulic parameters the information content of the observations could not be used completely so that the characterization of the parameter fields improved less than for the correct correlation length λ h 30 m for λ h 50 m scenario 2d l50 ndet ienkf both rmse and spread of the soil hydraulic parameters were lower than for λ h 30 m although the correlation length is overestimated now the reason could be that updating the parameter fields with a too long correlation length results in a more smoothed field as the rmse penalizes larger deviations much stronger squared deviations than smaller deviations a smoother field has the advantage that compared to the true reference field large outliers resulting in large contributions to rmse are avoided in addition in the case of too long correlation lengths it is also possible that updates which would potentially go in the wrong direction are corrected by other measurement points which are located closer to the grid cell to be updated it can also be observed that for λ h 50 m the spread decreases more than the rmse especially for soil saturation which is indicative of model variance underestimation and filter inbreeding therefore although the rmse s are slightly smaller for λ h 50 m than for λ h 30 m the spread values indicate that the quality of the updated ensemble of soil hydraulic parameter fields is not necessarily better now if the correlation length is further increased λ h 80 m scenario 2d l80 ndet ienkf and deviates more from the true value the rmse s of the soil hydraulic parameter fields do not decrease further but are still slightly smaller than for λ h 30 m the spread further decreases and is now indicative of a strong underestimation of the model error variance we repeated the same set of experiments for a 2nd reference field as shown in fig 5 the values of rmse and spread are given in table 5 the decrease of rmse and spread for log k log α vg and s are of the same order of magnitude as for the 1st set of reference fields for the true correlation length λ h 30m and also correlation lengths of 15 m and 50 m this implies that rmse s are also for the 2nd set of reference fields slightly lower for λ h 50 m than for λ h 30 m the underestimation of spread can again be observed for λ h 50 m for the 2nd reference field results for λ h 80 m are much worse than for the 1st reference field the overestimation of the correlation length not only results in too narrow spread now but also in a strong rmse increase of the soil hydraulic parameter fields from these results it can be concluded that the characterization of parameters and states is impacted in a different way if λ h is too small or too large a too small λ h results in larger rmse than for the correct λ h whereas a too large λ h causes an underestimation of the model error variance but did not result in larger rmse and even slightly smaller rmse than for the true correlation length 4 1 2 estimation by 1dienkf kriging method we also used 1d ienkf kriging to estimate 2d log k and log α vg fields for different spatial correlation length parameters scenarios 2d lxx ndet ienkf i fig 7 shows the estimated 2d log k andlog α vg fields using this alternative and fast approach it shows that the estimates for λ h 30 m scenario 2d l30 ndet ienkf i are as good as the ones by 3d ienkf the rmse and spread for log k and log α vg are even slightly smaller than those for 3d ienkf see table 4 for λ h 15 m scenario 2d l15 ndet ienkf i the estimated log k and log α vg fields are shown in fig 7 the influence of singular measurements can be easily detected from the figure in the form of circular patches low and high parameter values around the measurement location the estimated fields by 3d ienkf shown in fig 6 for λ h 15 m also show small circular patches with high and low parameter values but the results show spatial patterns more in correspondence with the reference field nevertheless the 1d ienkf kriging approach results in slightly smaller rmse and spread for λ h 15 m than 3d ienkf see table 4 in spite of the fact that it produces more artificial maps less in correspondence with the spatial patterns of the reference parameter fields than 3d ienkf the estimated ensemble fields for λ h 50 m by 1d ienkf kriging scenario 2d l50 ndet ienkf i are very close to those estimated by 3d ienkf for λ h 50 m the rmse values for the 1d ienkf kriging are smaller than the ones for 3d ienkf for λ h 50 m but for λ h 80 m scenario 2d l80 ndet ienkf i 3d ienkf clearly outperforms 1d ienkf kriging for the 2nd set of reference fields see fig 5 the rmse and spread values for the 1d ienkf kriging method are smaller than the ones for 3d ienkf for λ h 30 15 and 50 m see table 5 also for the 2nd set of reference fields results are very bad for λ h 80 m and even clearly worse than for 3d ienkf apparently 1d ienkf kriging is a fast and accurate alternative to 3d ienkf but is more affected by errors in the spatial correlation length of soil hydraulic parameters 4 1 3 estimation of 2d heterogeneous log k log α vg and n fields in the previous section the results for constant and known n were discussed in this section the results are presented for the case that all three parameters k α vg and n are spatially heterogeneous these experiments were only performed for 3d ienkf and not for 1d ienkf kriging we assumed a normal distribution for n with mean standard deviation and correlation length equal to μ n 2 5 σ n 0 2 and λ h 30 m for the purpose of a better comparison the true log k and log α vg fields were the same ones as used in the data assimilation experiments with constant and known n the estimated log k log α vg and nfields by the 3d ienkf method are shown in fig 8 the values of rmse and spread are given in table 6 in this case the correlation lengths of the soil hydraulic parameters were equal to the reference ones λ h 30 m scenario 2d l30 ienkf the results illustrate that the estimates of log k and log α vg are not affected by the uncertainty and spatial variability of n the n field is estimated with a decrease of the rmse by 20 after 20 data assimilation steps the additional uncertainty of ndoes not worsen the estimation of the model states the estimation of the model states is very similar for the cases with a deterministic homogeneousn and a stochastic heterogeneous n in summary the information content of the observations is large enough to improve the characterization of the three soil hydraulic parameters jointly 4 2 case b estimation of 3d heterogeneous log k log α vg and n fields in a next step the synthetic estimation problem was made more realistic by imposing a vertical correlation length λ v for the 3d heterogeneous reference fields of log k log α vg andnof 0 5 m so that vertical heterogeneity was introduced the horizontal correlation length λ h was 30 m the spatial distribution of the reference parameter fields at the land surface and at 1 5 m depth are shown in fig 9 similar to the results in section 4 1 we have compared the estimation of 3d parameter fields considering different guesses of the initial horizontal correlations lengths 4 2 1 estimation by 3d ienkf first results are discussed for the case that the correlation lengths used to generate the initial parameter fields are equal to the values for the reference fields λ h 30m scenario 3d l30 lv0 5 ienkf the estimated heterogeneous parameter fields at the land surface and at 1 5 m depth are shown in fig 10 the most important observation is that the estimated log k and log α vg fields at the land surface and at 1 5 m depth are closer to the reference while the estimated nfields differ strongly from the true n field for the 3d ensemble mean fields the rmse and spread at each depth below the ground surface were calculated fig 11 shows the variation of rmse and spread as function of depth in the soil profile z the decrease of rmse and spread values related to data assimilation is obvious however the rmse fluctuations in the vertical direction are significantly larger than the fluctuations in spread these fluctuations are not an artifact of the data assimilation as the rmse fluctuations in the vertical direction are also found for the open loop run the reason behind it may be that for the 3d true parameters fields the spatial horizontal average of parameters is not uniform but varies as a function of depth on the other hand the uniform profiles of spread for the open loop simulation confirm that the number of realizations 800 in the present study is sufficient the average values of rmse and spread from the land surface to 1 5 m depth are given in table 7 for both soil hydraulic parameters and saturation the rmse of log k and log α vg for the top 1 5 m reduced by 19 compared to the open loop run while the rmse of the n field was the same as for the open loop run fig 11 shows that the rmse values for log k and log α vg are close to 0 6 and 0 8 respectively near the ground surface and especially log α vg increases for depths below 1 5 m which is related to the more limited impact of the measurement data at this depth the spread shows a similar trend this can be explained by the slower changes of water saturation at deeper layers so that less information gain from measurements can be expected in addition water saturation in the deeper layers is also less sensitive to the measured saturation values because the measurements are situated further away and are less dense here the plots illustrate that the estimation of n does not improve the rmse for n is close to its prior standard deviation σ n 0 2 apparently the measurements do not contain enough information now to improve the characterization of all three soil hydraulic parameters as the smaller vertical correlation length limits the influence of the measurements the performance of 3d ienkf was also tested for λ h which differed from the true values we simulated the following four cases including smaller and larger correlation lengths than the reference along both horizontal and vertical directions i λ h 15 m λ v 0 5 m scenario 3d l15 lv0 5 ienkf ii λ h 50 m λ v 0 5 m scenario 3d l50 lv0 5 ienkf iii λ h 30 m λ v 1 0 m scenario 3d l30 lv1 0 ienkf and iv λ h 30 m λ v 0 3 m scenario 3d l15 lv0 3 ienkf the rmse and spread of the soil hydraulic parameters for these cases are also shown in fig 11 in all cases log k and log α vg are estimated better than n in terms of a relative improvement compared to the open loop run between the ground surface and z 1 5 m the rmse of log k and log α vg is close to 0 8 but log α vg increases below 1 5 m the estimated fields using a wrong correlation length give similar rmse and spread values as simulations with the correct correlation length except for the smaller horizontal correlation length λ h 15 m for λ h 15 m rmse and spread were larger again indicating that a too small correlation length compared to the true value results in a worse characterization of soil hydraulic parameters and states a misspecification of the vertical correlation length resulted in larger rmse for log α vg both in case of an underestimation as well as overestimation while the rmse for the other soil hydraulic parameters was similar and the rmse for soil saturation was only slightly higher these results point in general to a certain robustness of the method for errors in the correlation length of the parameters although errors in the specification of these correlation lengths have a certain negative impact 4 2 2 estimation by 1d ienkf kriging method we also estimated 3d fields of the three parameters using 1d ienkf kriging in this case λ h 30 m λ v 0 5 m was used same as true fields for interpolation by kriging scenario 3d l30 lv0 5 ienkf i estimated parameter fields are shown in fig 12 the rmse and spread as function of depth for each of the three parameters are shown in fig 11 for comparison with the 3d ienkf method the estimated ensemble mean fields displayed in fig 12 have slightly larger rmse values than the ones estimated by 3d ienkf in case of 3d heterogeneous parameter fields 1d ienkf kriging performs slightly worse than 3d ienkf to estimate parameters and states a plausible explanation is that in case of spatially varying permeability and other soil hydraulic parameters the vertical flux varies as function of x and y this may create pressure gradients in the horizontal direction and induce horizontal water flow as argued before the vertical water flow is dominant in this problem and in reality also at larger spatial scales and in the absence of steep slopes but for the 3d setup and the additional heterogeneity it is expected that horizontal flow plays a larger role 5 discussion the synthetic simulation experiments show that it is possible to jointly estimate spatially heterogeneous fields of permeability and mualem van genuchten parameters and improve the characterization of each of the three parameters this was achieved with an iterative ensemble kalman filter approach which guarantees a consistency between estimated states and parameters during the complete simulation period although the rmse of the ensemble mean parameter fields did not decrease so much compared to the open loop run in the simulation experiments often between 30 and 40 the spatial distributions of the estimated parameter fields show a high correspondence with the reference fields this points to the fact that the main structure of the parameter fields could be identified but small scale variations were not captured very well the success of the approach depends strongly on the horizontal correlation length of the soil hydraulic parameters versus the spacing between the measurement points a further complication is that little is known about the horizontal correlation structure of the van genuchten parameters as this has not been widely studied in the literature yet in this work a similar geostatistical model for the spatial variability of the van genuchten parameters has been adopted as for permeability which seems a reasonable assumption but which is less pinned by observational evidence if the distance between the measurement points is much larger than the correlation length the characterization of the soil hydraulic parameters for large parts of the simulation domain will not improve as the flow is normally vertically oriented so that the horizontal correlations of saturation content and pressure are also limited as dense networks of soil moisture sensors are only available in rare cases the 3d characterization of soil hydraulic parameters will only be meaningful for relatively small sites which have such dense observation networks this is typically the case at the field scale also the vertical correlation length plays an important role according the simulation experiments for a successful 3d characterization of soil hydraulic parameters it is important to have good prior information on the presence of soil horizons and sufficient dense observations of soil moisture with measurement data for each soil horizon as a consequence in practice the 3d characterization of spatially variable soil hydraulic parameters with data assimilation will remain very challenging in this work uncertainty of meteorological forcings was neglected which is another factor which will have contributed to more positive results in this study than can be expected under real world conditions the uncertainty of meteorological conditions was neglected as we wanted to focus on the feasibility to estimate 3d spatially distributed fields of multiple soil hydraulic parameters we therefore assumed that there was a meteorological station at site so that uncertainty is small however this is not always the case and typically for larger scale studies the uncertainty of meteorological forcings might play an important role and impede the reliable estimation of soil hydraulic parameters from soil saturation or soil moisture measurements the spatial variability of infiltration rate was not considered in this study the infiltration rate may vary spatially due to permeability and soil moisture variability of the top soil layer however we expect that at larger scales as imposed in this study horizontal redistribution of water is limited as the flow is predominantly gravity dominated we believe that this is a realistic condition as redistribution of infiltrating water related to ponding and surface runoff often plays a limited role in areas without steeper slopes especially at larger scales at the field scale spatially variable infiltration rates play an important role but we believe that the results of our study are not much affected by neglecting this process and expect that after infiltration the water flux in the unsaturated zone is also in this case predominantly vertical and gravity driven in this work it was assumed that permeability and the mualem van genuchten parameters were not correlated in practice however the parameters are correlated this correlation could for example be taken into account by the values provided by carsel and parish 1988 including information on the correlation between parameters will improve the characterization of the soil hydraulic parameters as the number of independent parameters to be estimated will be smaller therefore our simulation experiments present a pessimistic lower bound case of the expected improvement in the characterization of spatially variable fields of soil hydraulic parameters by data assimilation if the rest of the settings would be the same as in this study the data assimilation approach which was followed in this work guarantees a consistency between soil hydraulic parameters and states during the complete data assimilation process but is associated with additional computational costs compared to the classical ensemble kalman filter approach we assume that also in real world cases the values for the estimated soil hydraulic parameters stabilize over time so that after a number of updates the parameter updating can be stopped in this work 20 parameter updates were sufficient in practice for real time applications from that point onwards simulations could be continued with the estimated parameter values and data assimilation could be applied to only update states although the methodology followed here guarantees consistency between states and parameters the updating step itself is affected by linearizing over the ensemble the relation between measurements and model parameters therefore data assimilation approaches which can deal better with these non linearities are expected to give better results but currently particle filter approaches are not very efficient for 3d parameter estimation the particle filter can however be used for 1d parameter estimation and our simulations show that the subsequent interpolation of the estimated parameters by kriging can yield results which are close to a full 3d inversion however if horizontal flow plays a more important role it is expected that these two approaches 3d estimation versus 1d estimation plus kriging will show larger differences this could for example be the case for steeper slopes we are currently investigating under which conditions the 1d estimation plus kriging still provides good results for example as function of the steepness of slope 6 conclusions in this study different soil hydraulic parameters such as log transformed permeability log k the logarithm of the inverse capillary entry pressure log α vg and the exponent n of the mualem van genuchten model were estimated by assimilating time series of soil saturation data with the iterative ensemble kalman filter approach in a synthetic experiment the parameter estimation was tested for both 2d and 3d heterogeneous soil hydraulic parameter fields and for different initial guesses of the correlation length parameter of the semivariogram results for the 2d case showed that the characterization of the ensemble mean log k and log α vg fields improved considerably with 30 40 rmse reduction compared to the open loop run if also n is uncertain we found that the estimation of the n field did not improve as much 20 as the log k and log α vg fields it was also observed that considering n as unknown and variable does not affect the quality of the estimation of log k and log α vg this result shows that for the 2d case the three spatially heterogeneous fields of soil hydraulic parameters could be estimated successfully together if the estimation is based on a too small correlation length the characterization of the spatially variable soil hydraulic parameter fields is clearly worse compared to the case where the true correlation length is used but if the estimation is based on a too large correlation length the characterization of the soil hydraulic parameter fields is in general not worse but the model variance is underestimated in those cases we considered also fully 3d heterogeneous cases with a vertical correlation length of 0 5 m the improvement in the characterization of log k and log α vg expressed in terms of rmse reduction compared with the open loop for the case with vertical heterogeneity was around 20 now and the rmse for the estimation of the n field was the same as for the open loop run this shows that for the fully 3d heterogeneous case the estimation of spatially variable parameter fields is more challenging given the reduced information content of the measurements but still some improvement in the characterization of the ensemble mean soil hydraulic parameter fields is possible we evaluated also an alternative method 1d ienkf kriging for estimating soil hydraulic parameters from soil saturation time series recorded during infiltration experiments since the water flow in the vadose zone is predominantly vertical the vertical profiles of the three parameters log k log α vg and n were estimated for the different soil columns corresponding to the different measurement locations kriging was used to construct a 3d field of the estimated parameters this method is very efficient as only 1d model simulations need to be performed the results were very close to the ones obtained for 3d simulations without significant lateral water flow 1d ienkf kriging can be used as an efficient alternative approach for estimation of soil hydraulic parameter fields however the approach is more sensitive to misspecification of the parameter correlation lengths these results show the feasibility of estimating 3d spatially distributed fields of soil hydraulic parameters but results are strongly affected by the horizontal correlation of the soil hydraulic parameters in comparison to the distance between monitoring locations in many real world cases few monitoring locations are available and the correlation distance of soil hydraulic parameters is relatively small therefore improved characterization of 3d fields of soil hydraulic parameters by assimilating soil moisture data is likely limited to intensively monitored field sites acknowledgements the first author is grateful to

generation using k l expansion to generate the ensemble of heterogeneous fields we adopted the karhunen loeve k l expansion method ghanem and spanos 1991 li and zhang 2007 a brief description of the k

correspond to the ith eigenvalue and eigenfunction of the spatial correlation function of r x x here xand x denote the coordinate vectors of two arbitrary points in space in this study we have considered that the heterogeneous parameter field follows a squared exponential correlation function a2 r x x exp x x 2 2 λ 2 x y y 2 2 λ 2 y z z 2 2 λ 2 z where λ x λ y and λ z are respectively the spatial correlation length in x y and z directions most often the eigenvalues and eigenfunctions cannot be derived analytically for the given spatial correlation function but it is very easy to find these in discrete form as the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the correlation matrix for a given computational domain if r is the correlation matrix obtained from eq a2 for the discretized random field and f i is the eigenvector they satisfy the following equation a3 r λ i i f i 0 the number of eigenvalues and eigenvectors obtained from eq a3 is the same as the size of the square and symmetric correlation matrix np however the number of eigenmodes n used to generate the random field is much smaller than the size of the matrix as the eigenvalues associated with the higher eigenmodes are very small in general the value of n should be large if λ l is small where λ is the correlation length and l is size of the domain in the same direction the accuracy of the series expansion in eq a1 can be

741,most reactive transport codes and algorithms decouple the flow from the reactive transport calculations in some cases geochemical reactions lead to significant modifications of porosity or water content which can have an impact on the flow the flow problem is based on the continuity equation and is described in terms of pressure however most reactive transport codes do not model the pressure evolution through mineral reactions the aim of this study is to recouple the reactive transport and the flow by providing an accurate description of the evolution of both the porosity and the water in the reactive system we discuss a formulation of the geochemical solver based on a mole conservation which allows an accurate computation of the volume and masses of all phases this allows for a water and pore volume computation at the scale of the rev which can impact the fluid pressure hence the flow additionally solving the geochemical equilibrium in terms of moles instead of concentrations is more accurate for problems involving important mineral reactions finally this method is suited to saturated unsaturated and two phase flow this method is easy to implement and can be used in different reactive transport simulators regardless of their numerical approaches we also test the numerical efficiency of this approach and apply it to fully coupled problems involving variable porosity

decades reactive transport modeling has become more and more common in the scientific community as shown by its recent application in the framework of gas storage li et al 2014 and mining activities avasarala et al 2017 pabst et al 2017 its range of applications has steadily increased given the different environmental issues and the different physical processes targeted by the field of reactive transport this growth is likely to continue for many decades most reactive transport simulators solve the flow and the reactive transport problem separately steefel et al 2014 saturated and unsaturated flow are usually simulated in 1 to 3 dimensions in codes such as orchestra meeussen 2003 min3p mayer et al 2002 in recent years other codes have also developed a multiphase multicomponent flow such as hytec van der lee et al 2003 sin et al 2017 toughreact xu et al 2006 and pflotran mills et al 2007 due to the highly nonlinear nature of the geochemical equations the reactive transport problem can be solved in different ways three main approaches are used the global implicit algorithm gia such as crunchflow steefel 2009 the sequential non iterative algorithm snia and the sequential iterative algorithm sia some of which were compared in carrayrou et al 2010 the different capabilities of the reactive transport codes regarding geochemical reactions are summed up in steefel et al 2014 most reactive transport codes are able to deal with the local evolutions of porosity when considering mineral dissolution and precipitation reactions for the gia approaches like min3p mayer et al 2002 the porosity is updated at the end of the reactive transport procedure this constitutes an explicit treatment of the porosity additionally when the water balance is not performed which is the case for most reactive transport codes the evolution of porosity corresponds to the evolution of water content for saturated cases therefore the evolution of porosity modifies the concentrations of the different species in solution hence the global equilibrium even though this effect is small it cannot be represented by an explicit update of the porosity an accurate treatment of the porosity therefore requires an implicit calculation of the porosity for the sia approach such as hytec porosity evolution is solved implicitly during the iterative procedure these approaches compute the porosity based on the conservation of the total concentration this is not accurate either as this does not model the dilution effect of evolving porosity therefore when a mineral dissolves increasing porosity and creating empty volumes the reactive transport codes face two choices either create mass water and solutes to fill this empty volume or ignore it neither cases are accurate nor satisfactory furthermore reactive transport is generally decoupled from flow meaning that flow produced by the dis appearance of a solid volume is not taken into account to overcome this limitation and provide a strong and accurate coupling between flow and the reactive transport a volume balance of the different phases including water has to be assessed to this end it is thus necessary to take into account the production and consumption of water through chemical reactions the chemical role of water is important in some applications like cement hydration or unsaturated cases examples are given in senger et al 2008 and croisé et al 2011 most reactive transport code treat water as the solvent whose amount is not subject to modifications therefore the evolution of the concentration of one species is directly proportional to the evolution of its mass however when considering the aforementioned cases where water plays a chemical role as a reactant the consumption movement of water can impact the equilibrium of different species e g water being consumed increases the concentrations of the other species which can trigger mineral reactions for that reason if water has to become a primary species it has to be incorporated in the geochemical system as the molality of water is constant reasoning in terms of mass instead of concentrations makes more sense in this paper we present a numerically efficient and accurate method for assessing the production consumption of water in variable porosity cases it consists in writing the conservation equations in terms of mass mol not only this method provides an easy and accurate computation of the equilibrium taking water into account it also allows to accurately compute the volume of the different phases hence if the overall volume increases precipitation of a certain amount of mineral volume this can be linked to a pressure evolution and to the flow problem this method thus allows a volume balance and a coupling with un saturated and multiphase flow and erases the aforementioned problems inherent to variable porosity the work of gamazo et al 2012 improved the description of water within reactive transport simulations by addressing the water as a chemical reactant however it does not address the variable porosity issue or how a production consumption of water and solid species have an impact on the flow while these functionalities are developed for the purpose of gas storage or atmospheric carbonation of concrete they are also applicable to a wide range of applications dealing with variable porosities and saturations the main strengths of this approach are its accuracy numerical efficiency robustness and the fact that its application is valid for different flow problems whether saturated unsaturated or multiphase this constitutes a more accurate approach on variable porosity issues in reactive transport modeling at the rev scale note however that this paper does not address the microstructure evolutions which control the effective transport properties these effects are taken into account using empirical relationships even if their use does not accurately represent the physical behavior of real materials with complex microstructures seigneur et al 2017 this paper is organized as follows section 2 presents the mathematical formulation of the addressed problems section 3 addresses the numerical approaches dedicated to solve them section 4 presents model verifications for different flow regimes they aim at emphasizing different physical behaviors and the numerical robustness of strongly coupled simulations finally section 5 summarizes the main conclusions and perspectives of this work some emphasis will be given to the reactive transport code hytec van der lee et al 2002 2003 which was used to test the approach and applications this code is based on an sia approach it has been used and validated in a wide variety of applications benchmark studies lagneau and van der lee 2010 cement degradation de windt and devillers 2010 and geological storage of gases corvisier et al 2013 sin 2015 2 mathematical formulation 2 1 geochemical system 2 1 1 primary and secondary species the formalism of the primary and secondary species was extensively described in lichtner 1996 in the following we use similar notations i will be used as a subscript for basis species while j will be used as a subscript for secondary species the chemical system contains ns species nsolid solid naq aqueous and ng gaseous species n s n s o l i d n a q n g these species are linked through nr independent equilibrium reactions meaning that n b n s n r species can be arbitrarily chosen as basis species morel and hering 1993 while n d n s n b are the derived secondary species therefore any one of the nd derived species denoted sj can be written in terms of the nb primary species and the set of nr chemical reactions can be written in terms of the same basis species denoted ci so that 1 i 1 n b α i j c i s j such as oh h2o h when equilibrium is considered the molalities of secondary species denoted sj can be expressed from the basis species activities ai and the mass action law 2 s j k j γ j i 1 n b a i α i j where the γi coefficients are the activity coefficients of species i and kj is the thermodynamic equilibrium constant producing sj for aqueous species the activity coefficients relates their concentrations to their activities these coefficients can be computed from different empirical models debye huckel pitzer 1991 b dot helgeson 1969 helgeson s model helgeson et al 1981 can be used to compute the water activity the use of mass action law also is valid for minerals their activities can be chosen as one for pure phase or can be computed using mixing rules for solid solutions mineral reactions can also be kinetically controlled in this case some variations of transition state theory rate law lasaga 1981 are usually chosen to compute the reaction rate of any mineral the latter is written in terms of moles as 3 d n j d t m h 2 o n h 2 o k s 1 q j k j where qj represents the ion activity product k the rate constant of the reaction mol m2 s s is the specific surface m2 g and m h 2 o and n h 2 o respectively refer to the molar mass and the number of moles of water additional factors can be taken into account catalysts or inhibitors monod type relations and others for the liquid gas equilibrium 4 s j g s j a q henry s law relates the activity aj to the fugacity fj at equilibrium through henry s constant hj 5 f s j g h j a s j a q in ideal cases the gas fugacity corresponds to its partial pressure pi henry s law can be written in terms of the basis species formalism so that a similar mass action law can be used for gaseous species the concentration gj of the gaseous species can be computed 6 g j n j ω s g v tot with ω sg and vtot respectively represent the porosity the gas saturation and the local volume meaning that ωsgv tot represents the gas volume using ideal gas law r t g j f s j g this leads to 7 g j h j a s j a q r t while a s j a q is expressed with the mass action law 2 2 1 2 mass formalism for a fully coupled problem with an accurate volume balance a formulation in terms of moles is powerful as it allows a proper mass and volume calculation the total molar amount of each basis species is obtained by multiplying the total concentration by the mass of water we define the total amount in moles of each basis species as ni while the amount in moles of any species is written ni 8 n i n i j 1 n d α j i n j which can be written as 9 n i n i j 1 n d α j i m h 2 o s j let us define the following notation where x can refer to gas solid mineral min aqueous aq immobile or water h2o 10 δ i x 1 if species i of type x 0 otherwise using this notation the mass action law can be written in terms of moles as well 11 s j k j γ j i 1 n b γ i n i m h 2 o α i j δ i a q a i α i j δ i m i n a h 2 o α h 2 o j δ i h 2 o in the latter equation two of the factors in the product always equal one for kinetic minerals which are not part of the basis species eq 3 is solved implicitly 12 n j t δ t n j t δ t m h 2 o n h 2 o t δ t k s 1 q j t δ t k j 2 1 3 resulting system the resulting system of equations consists of nb nonlinear equations for each basis species 13 i n b n i n i j 1 n d α j i n j using eqs 11 and 12 to compute nj this set of equations is solved for the unknowns ni 2 2 reactive transport 2 2 1 general equations when considering transport a distinction has to be made between the mobile hence transportable and immobile species the total mobile and immobile concentrations are respectively denoted ti and t i in mol l of water usually for the un saturated case the aqueous transport equation is written 14 ω s l t i t d ω s l t i t i u l ω s l t i t where ω s l t i t is the reaction rate corresponding to the im mobilization of the primary species i the divergence term corresponds to the diffusive dispersive flux where u l represents the darcy velocity of the fluid phase see section 2 3 d ω sl is the porosity saturation dependent effective diffusion coefficient 2 2 2 mass formalism in the temporal derivatives of eq 14 ω s l c i represents the mobile amount of species i per volume of rock mol lrock to switch towards a mass formulation one needs to replace this term as mi v tot with v tot being the local volume and mi being the total mobile amount of species i 15 m i n i j 1 n d δ j mobile α i j n j now the reactive transport equation can be written in terms of mass 16 1 v tot m i t d ω s l x i x i u l r i s v tot where 17 x i m i n h 2 o v h 2 o let us have a closer look at the latter equation this indicates that if m h 2 o n h 2 o chemically bound water is small compared to the free water and if water density is assumed constant no diffusive transport of water is obtained however for highly saline solutions the solution volume might significantly differ from the water volume the developed method has no limitations regarding these effects the evolution of the density and the shift between solution and water volume could be modeled through the water molar volume v h 2 o taking into account temperature composition or pressure effects to accurately compute water density let us emphasize that n h 2 o represents the actual free water in the system and not the chemically bound water this amount can be modified by the flow and by the geochemical reactions for other species ni incorporates the mobile derived species the chemical mobile water associated with solutes is neglected in that equation for clarity purposes in eq 16 the reaction rate corresponds to 18 r i s j 1 n s δ j immobile α i j n j t writing the two phase reactive transport equations in terms of moles is rather straightforward a gaseous source term is added for the liquid gas equilibrium 19 r i g j 1 n s δ j g a s α i j n j t 20 1 v tot m i l t d l ω s l x i x i u l r i s r i g v tot aqueous 1 v

d t 24 r v s d ω d t 1 v tot j 1 n s δ j solid d n j d t v j 2 3 flow problem in the reactive transport community three main flow regimes are considered first the saturated flow considers a fully saturated porous medium the pore space is filled with water second the unsaturated flow considers the movement of water in an unsaturated medium by taking into account the effects of the gas phase only through the values of the relative permeabilities and capillary pressures while the gas pressure is considered uniform and constant the unsaturated flow simplification does not model the gas phase on its own however in recent years the need for complete simulation of this gas phase has arisen and led to two phase flow simulations hytec treats those different flow regimes whose mathematical formulations are reviewed here the flow problem aims at computing the darcy muskat velocity muskat et al 1937 u α for the different fluid phases α 25 u α k r α κ μ α p α ρ α g in this equation μα is the fluid viscosity kg m s κ is the intrinsic permeability m 2 pα is the fluid pressure pa g is the gravity vector k r α is the relative permeability of the medium to the fluid phase α which expresses the deviation from saturated cases 2 3 1 saturated flow in general the considered saturated flow equation is the diffusivity equation marsily 1981 the latter is based on the continuity equation for the fluid and solid phase 26 ρ l u l ρ l ω t ρ l q v l ρ l r v l ρ s u s ρ s 1 ω t ρ s r v s coupled to the darcy equation 25 for the velocity in the continuity equation q v l represents an external volumetric flux of water which we neglect in the following developments in addition two source terms are added r v s and r v l corresponding to chemical appearance of water or solid defined by eqs 23 and 24 coupling these equations both for the fluid and solid phase leads to the diffusivity equation see marsily 1981 we first obtain 27 ρ l κ μ l p l ρ l g z ρ l 1 ω ω t ρ l ω ρ s ρ s t ω ρ l t ρ l r v l ρ l ω 1 ω r v s from there constitutive equations are used to link the different variables with the liquid pressure introducing the liquid and solid compressibilities βl and βs and an elasticity coefficients αl and αs one can write 28 ρ l t ρ l β l p l t ρ s t ρ s α s β l p l t ω t 1 ω α l α s p l t r v s the only difference with marsily 1981 lies in the solid source term developing further leads to 29 ρ l κ μ l p l ρ l g z ρ l α l α s ρ l ω α s ω β l ρ l p l t ρ l r v s ρ l r v l combining the latter equation β s α s 1 1 ω dividing by ρl and considering ρ l 0 using h z p ρ l g defining the hydraulic conductivity k κ ρ l g μ and considering slow displacements of the solid interfaces we obtain the usual diffusivity equation with two additional source terms 30 s s h t k h r v l r v s with the usual specific storage coefficient 31 s s ρ l ω g β l β s α l ω the source terms were defined in eqs 23 and 24 these correspond to the solid and water sources from the geochemical reactions in the initial version of the diffusivity equation the evolution of porosity was only caused by the evolution of the fluid pressure through the specific storage coefficient now the diffusivity equation incorporates the geochemical reaction terms which can modify the volume of both the water and solid phases let us interpret these chemical source terms if the two source terms compensate each other perfectly i e r v l r v s 0 no impact is observed apart from permeability updates if at one point r v l r v s 0 this leads to an increase of pressure which will impact the flow indeed if a mineral starts precipitating this will push water away this corresponds to a local increase in pressure more generally for hydrated minerals the importance of this coupling will depend on the relative molar volumes of these minerals and the amount of released water this term defines the mineral net volume balance 2 3 2 unsaturated flow the unsaturated flow equation is the richards equation richards 1931 32 θ h t k θ h r v l which has to be coupled with an unsaturated law such as the van genuchten relationship 33 θ h θ r θ s θ r 1 α h n 1 1 n where θ is the volumetric water content representing the volume fraction of water inside a rock its value ranges from 0 and the porosity ω of the rock the water saturation sl is given by 34 s l θ ω when porosity evolves without any production or consumption of water the saturation hence the pressure evolves as well however adding a solid source term in richard s law is not accurate therefore another equation is added for the solid phase and richard s and van genuchten equations are written in terms of saturation instead of water content 35 ω t r v s ω s l t k s l h r v l 2 3 3 two phase flow the two phase flow equations are based on the continuity equations for the two fluid phases 36 ω s α ρ α t ρ α u α ρ α r v α the reaction term ρ α r v α describes the mass of water and gas produced by chemical reactions sin et al 2017 described in details the formulation of the two phase flow to close the system the capillary pressure pc linking the pressures of the two fluids and closure equations between the saturations sα of the two phases are added 37 s l s g 1 38 p g p l p c s the capillary pressure and relative permeability models can be chosen from different models e q van genuchten and nielsen 1985 brooks corey the full system can be written on the basis of two primary variables chosen to be the liquid pressure pl and the gas saturation sg 39 ω t r v s ω 1 s g ρ l t ρ l k r l κ μ l p l ρ l g ρ l r v l ω s g ρ g t ρ g k r g κ μ g p l p c ρ g g ρ g r v g note that similar equations would be obtained for other formulations liquid pressure gas pressure 3 numerical solution the different numerical methods used to tackle the presented problems are here presented with emphasis on the main modifications which have been developed in order to couple the variable porosity with the water balance and the flow 3 1 geochemical system let us focus on how the geochemical equilibrium is solved if it is written in terms of moles instead of molalities in general and in hytec in particular a newton raphson nr procedure is used to solve the nonlinear geochemical system in eq 13 the set of basis species always includes water minerals at equilibrium and aqueous species therefore kinetic minerals gaseous species and other aqueous species are part of the secondary species at each iteration of the newton raphson procedure the amount in moles of each basis species is computed as well as the amount of water allowing the computation of the concentrations this means that for the sia approach the geochemical structure can be maintained allowing a rather simple implementation of this method only the jacobian structure needs to be modified for the nr procedure the derivatives of the different equations need to be taken into account the amount of a derived species is obtained by the mass action law eq 11 for aqueous and gaseous species and eq 12 for kinetic mineral species therefore one can write the required derivatives of the nr procedure 40 n j n i α i j n j n i α i j s j c i δ i a q 1 also for the minerals at equilibrium which are part of the basis species 41 n j n i 0 δ i m i n 1 and δ j a q 1 as the mass action law depends on the activities of the mineral species and not their concentrations the derivatives of the kinetic minerals can be computed from eq 3 this means that for all aqueous species the jacobian structure remains the same thus the modifications of the geochemical solving procedure are limited one only needs to add the water derivatives the dependence of the aqueous concentration of one derived species j on the amount of water is denoted λj 42 λ j i 1 n b α i j δ i a q leading to 43 n j n h 2 o λ j n j n h 2 o 3 2 reactive transport for sia approach the mass formalism does not modify significantly the reactive transport algorithm the only difference lies in the fact that the chemistry has to be provided with the amount of water present in each cell which is computationally free fig 1 describes the temporal evolution of the key variables and introduce some notation which will be used in the following for clarity purposes 3 2 1 computing the source terms for flow the most important step is to compute the different source terms for the flow coupling reactive transport is now able to modify the water mass and the porosity let us denote by fl and rt the values of before and after the reactive transport procedure the source terms will be written as 44 q v s ω f l ω r t 45 q v l m h 2 o r t m h 2 o f l ρ h 2 o v tot 3 2 2 convergence for the sia approach the convergence of the reactive transport iterative loop is obtained when the following conditions are satisfied 46 n i t δ t m 1 n i t δ t m ϵ r t s n i t δ t m 1 n i g t δ t m 1 n i g t δ t m ϵ r t g n i g t δ t m 1 indicating that the immobile and gas masses reach a fixed point between two successive iterations m 1 and m 3 3 flow problem 3 3 1 saturated and unsaturated flow the linear saturated flow eq 30 with the two volumetric source terms is solved straightforwardly 47 s s h t δ t h t δ t k h r v l r v s these source terms which take the same form for the different regimes are 48 r v s q v s δ t 49 r v l q v l δ t in hytec the resolution of the unsaturated flow eqs 35 relies on celia s method celia et al 1990 the porosity is first updated to modify the saturation with the same initial water content and we add the water source term to the richard s equation and follow celia s procedure 3 3 2 two phase flow problem the first equation for the solid phase guarantees that the porosity used for the 2 phase flow calculation matches the porosity computed by the reactive transport indeed the flow does not impact the porosity 50 ω f l t δ t ω r t t δ t q v s δ t which guarantees that the porosity computed by the flow matches the porosity computed by the geochemical solver at the previous timestep the resolution scheme of the two other equations is extensively described in sin et al 2017 and sin 2015 3 4 general algorithm to summarize the previous sections the global algorithm is schematically depicted in fig 2 for an sia approach such as in hytec it starts with the computation of the flow the flow solver requires the solid and liquid reaction rates r v s and r v l as well as the porosity to take into account permeability updates these quantities are used to assess the fluid pressure profiles to compute the darcy velocities u l which are used for the transport calculations the evolution of saturation due to the flow solver unsaturated two phase is translated into a modification of the water mass note that even though the mass of solids is unaffected by flow their concentrations might evolve due to the movement of water the transport is computed based on the diffusive and computed adective fluxes the chemistry yields the liquid solid gas equilibrium in particular it provides at each iteration the evolution of the mass of water hence saturation porosity and concentrations of solid species this iterative procedure is performed until convergence defined by eq 46 4 numerical simulations and results 4 1 introduction to the simulations in this section two one dimensional verification cases for hytec are presented the parameters were chosen in order to obtain a strong coupling between the flow and reactive transport though the choice of parameters was not motivated by modeling a real experiment the different simulations loosely represent some actual reactive transport problems the saturated flow simulation models the precipitation and dissolution of different minerals these reactions consume and release water to create flow in an initially diffusive problem the two phase flow simulation represents a coupled drying and clogging phenomenon of a partially saturated material the aim of these simulations is to demonstrate the accuracy of the method 4 1 1 reactive system the following simulations will be based upon the same model geochemical system the set of aqueous chemical species are given in table 1 three different minerals were chosen in this simulation their characteristics are summed up in table 2 let us define their water balance as the volume of water released by the dissolution of one mole of the mineral and their net volume change ν tot as the difference in volume generated by the dissolution of one mole of the mineral 51 ν j tot α j h 2 o v h 2 o v j one can also write 52 r v s r v l 1 v tot j 1 n s δ j solid ν j tot d n j d t which emphasizes the fact that this net volume change of a mineral leads to the volumic source terms in the following cases even though the net volume changes are always negative the sign of r v s r v l will be modified when considering dissolution or precipitation through the simulations the minerals will be controlled by the thermodynamic equilibrium 4 2 additional parameters 4 2 1 simplifying assumptions for the solid liquid gas equilibrium the activity and fugacity coefficients are equal to unity ideal solution and gas assumptions while the activity of minerals at equilibrium is 1 furthermore an isothermal flow is considered with a constant water density for the two phase flow problem the liquid and gas viscosities are assumed constant 4 2 2 evolution of transport properties the effective diffusion coefficient d e f f α is subject to modifications during the dissolution precipitation reactions this dependence is taken from empirical relationships archie s law eq 53 from archie 1942 is taken for saturated cases for unsaturated and two phase cases millington quirk eq 54 from millington and quirk 1961 is used for the impact on permeability kozeny carman relation eq 55 is used 53 d eff ω d eff ω 0 ω ω c ω 0 ω c n 54 d eff α ω s α d α ω 4 3 s α 10 3 55 k k 0 1 ω 0 1 ω 2 ω ω 0 3 4 3 precipitation and dissolution reactions in a saturated system 4 3 1 description the first simulation considers a saturated flow and is depicted in fig 3 three different zones are considered left center and right for a total of 60 nodes the different geometrical and hydrodynamic parameters used are summed up in table 3 while initial chemistry is given in table 4 this simulation involves three main mineral reactions mineral amin is going to dissolve from the central reservoir while producing water two aqueous species baq and caq counter diffuse towards each other to form a mineral bcmin whose precipitation consumes water also the diffusion of d allows for the precipitation of admin using aaq released from the dissolution of amin the boundary conditions consider a constant concentration of species through time corresponding to the initial reservoir chemistries the initial pressure and boundary conditions are uniform hence an initial diffusive regime the simulation is performed over 10 years the goal of this simulation is to illustrate how the geochemical reactions are inducing a flow in an initially purely diffusive problem the choice of parameters was influenced by a desire to produce strong effects and is likely not representative of any experimental results 4 3 2 results fig 4 shows the evolution of porosity and minerals volume fractions over time one can observe the progressive dissolution from both ends of mineral amin this dissolution increases the porosity and has a negative volume balance i e r v l r v s 0 decreasing the pressure this generates a flowrate water is drawn in from both constant head boundaries as shown in fig 5 a positive water flow indicates water going towards the positive value of x the movement of water generated by the dissolution of mineral amin is represented after 146 days in red in fig 5 meanwhile on the left side of the domain the precipitation of mineral admin occurs which induces an asymmetric behavior for the flowrate as this mineral is present aaq remains on the left end of the dissolving rock this reduces the concentration gradient of aaq slowing down the dissolution of amin on the left compared to its dissolution on the right at later times as baq and caq diffuse towards each other mineral bcmin starts precipitating this precipitation consumes water but has a positive volume balance r v l r v s 0 which leads to a pressure increase this pushes water away as is represented by the blue curve after 2 years in fig 5 as water is consumed during the precipitation of bcmin the concentration of aaq increases and the solution becomes supersaturated with regards to mineral amin the precipitation of bcmin leads to the further precipitation of amin however this impact remains limited because the amount of aaq is limited and that the induced flow pushes water away let us note that transport remain dominated by diffusion advective flux less than two orders of magnitude than diffusive flux this is confirmed by the symmetric concentration profile of the tracer after 2 years as can be seen in fig 6 this precipitation of bcmin which has a large molar volume sharply decreases the porosity at larger timescales the porosity and the transport properties have dropped significantly after ten years the porosity is so low that no further diffusion occurs beyond the precipitation front mineral bcmin starts dissolving on both sides of the front to provide baq resp caq on right resp left side of the system very low diffusion at the peak prevents dissolution in this thin zone sharpening the front this phenomenon decreases the pressure and water is again sucked in the material as can be seen after 8 years in fig 5 the simulation is very effective and no numerical instabilities happen even at very low porosities 4 4 two phase flow 4 4 1 description this simulation couples a two phase flow with a gaseous component dg which when dissolved in water will react with mineral amin to form admin 56 d g d h h 2 o with logk 5 the geometry is simple and consists of one rock filled with mineral amin in contact with a constant low saturation area on the left representing an infinite atmosphere the material consists of mineral amin the geochemical system is the same than for the previous simulation with the addition of one gaseous species the atmospheric zone has a constant saturation through time and a constant partial pressure of gaseous component dg these conditions correspond to the left boundary condition the material zone is initially partially saturated and is modeled through 50 nodes flow gas diffusion and dissolution and mineral reactions are studied over one year only the left end of the material is in contact with this atmosphere this drying problem coupled with dissolution precipitation of minerals can be linked to a process such as the atmospheric carbonation of partially saturated concrete the hydrodynamic parameters and the initial chemical conditions are respectively given in tables 5 and 6 the simulation and its geometry is depicted in fig 7 for this simulation capillary pressure and relative permeability laws are required van genuchten relations were chosen using parameters given in table 7 57 p c s l p e 1 s l s r l 1 s r l s r g 1 n 1 n 58 k r g s g s g s r g 1 s r l s r g 1 s g s r g 1 s r l s r g 1 n 2 n 59 k r l s l s

days the drying is almost complete before the complete drying advection is the main transport process after which transport is dominated by gas diffusion on the other hand the dissolution of mineral amin increases the porosity and releases water as can be seen in figs 9 as porosity and water mass increase the effect on saturation is limited one can see a small discontinuity on the saturation curves located at the dissolution front at early times in this simulation water flows out of the system and some water is produced by the dissolution of mineral amin fig 10 shows the evolution of the different minerals one can observe the dissolution of mineral amin as well as the precipitation of mineral admin after one year this precipitation has occurred within the 10 first centimeters of the material 5 conclusion and perspectives in this paper we proposed a new approach to compute the geochemical equilibrium based on a conservation of moles instead of concentration this approach exhibits several advantages 1 its implementation into an existing reactive transport code is rather easy it only requires slightly changing the numerical approach within the core of the jacobian structure of the geochemical calculation so that the system is expressed in terms of mass rather than concentrations in hytec for instance these modifications are almost transparent 2 it allows for a correct assessment of the water mass evolution through chemical reactions and flow 3 as the amounts in moles of both water and solids are obtained this allows an easy computation of the different volumes 4 this volume assessment can be easily coupled to flow as simple source term 5 this is an implicit and accurate treatment of the mass balance problem furthermore the numerical efficiency seems to have been improved the average amount of required iterations for the geochemical and reactive transport solvers have decreased additionally no unstable behavior was witnessed even at very low porosities the different simulations performed are running faster than similar simulations without porosity update however let us indicate that this numerical improvement was not extensively verified the fact that the role of water has now be reconciled between the reactive transport and flow problems new developments are available for example the physical and chemical activity of water can be properly estimated the latter can have a significant impact in some cases for instance when dealing with hydration of minerals with limited amounts of water available cement and concrete hydration or very low saturation the kinetics of the dissolution and precipitation reaction can be strongly influenced by the amount of water present the main limitation regarding the proposed approach is the fact that the water density was assumed to be independent from pressure while this assumption might not be suited in certain cases the developped approach does not prevent from addressing an equation of state for the water to link its volume to the pressure in that case the water density could be modeled to be dependent of temperature chemical composition and pressure for reactive transport modellng implicating density dependent flow this would have to be implemented the only modifications in the proposed equations would appear while dealing with the source terms for the flow coupling and to modify the water molar volume for the reactive transport problem these implementations would probably take place within an additional more detailed coupling with temperature and heat transfers finally this method allows to consider an impact of geochemical reactions on matrix properties consequently it implicitly reflects a feedback on the pressure field this feature can be used when modeling effective and shear stresses so that a role of precipitated dissolved minerals will implicitly be taken into account this evolution will be related to the ability of a rock to release the water through its permeability and its ability to accommodate the pressure through its specific storage coefficient if the geochemical source term in the flow equations are too important for the material to handle this might be used to assess when or whether a material could be mechanically damaged this method could therefore help improve the chemistry transport mechanical coupling acknowledgments the

741,most reactive transport codes and algorithms decouple the flow from the reactive transport calculations in some cases geochemical reactions lead to significant modifications of porosity or water content which can have an impact on the flow the flow problem is based on the continuity equation and is described in terms of pressure however most reactive transport codes do not model the pressure evolution through mineral reactions the aim of this study is to recouple the reactive transport and the flow by providing an accurate description of the evolution of both the porosity and the water in the reactive system we discuss a formulation of the geochemical solver based on a mole conservation which allows an accurate computation of the volume and masses of all phases this allows for a water and pore volume computation at the scale of the rev which can impact the fluid pressure hence the flow additionally solving the geochemical equilibrium in terms of moles instead of concentrations is more accurate for problems involving important mineral reactions finally this method is suited to saturated unsaturated and two phase flow this method is easy to implement and can be used in different reactive transport simulators regardless of their numerical approaches we also test the numerical efficiency of this approach and apply it to fully coupled problems involving variable porosity

decades reactive transport modeling has become more and more common in the scientific community as shown by its recent application in the framework of gas storage li et al 2014 and mining activities avasarala et al 2017 pabst et al 2017 its range of applications has steadily increased given the different environmental issues and the different physical processes targeted by the field of reactive transport this growth is likely to continue for many decades most reactive transport simulators solve the flow and the reactive transport problem separately steefel et al 2014 saturated and unsaturated flow are usually simulated in 1 to 3 dimensions in codes such as orchestra meeussen 2003 min3p mayer et al 2002 in recent years other codes have also developed a multiphase multicomponent flow such as hytec van der lee et al 2003 sin et al 2017 toughreact xu et al 2006 and pflotran mills et al 2007 due to the highly nonlinear nature of the geochemical equations the reactive transport problem can be solved in different ways three main approaches are used the global implicit algorithm gia such as crunchflow steefel 2009 the sequential non iterative algorithm snia and the sequential iterative algorithm sia some of which were compared in carrayrou et al 2010 the different capabilities of the reactive transport codes regarding geochemical reactions are summed up in steefel et al 2014 most reactive transport codes are able to deal with the local evolutions of porosity when considering mineral dissolution and precipitation reactions for the gia approaches like min3p mayer et al 2002 the porosity is updated at the end of the reactive transport procedure this constitutes an explicit treatment of the porosity additionally when the water balance is not performed which is the case for most reactive transport codes the evolution of porosity corresponds to the evolution of water content for saturated cases therefore the evolution of porosity modifies the concentrations of the different species in solution hence the global equilibrium even though this effect is small it cannot be represented by an explicit update of the porosity an accurate treatment of the porosity therefore requires an implicit calculation of the porosity for the sia approach such as hytec porosity evolution is solved implicitly during the iterative procedure these approaches compute the porosity based on the conservation of the total concentration this is not accurate either as this does not model the dilution effect of evolving porosity therefore when a mineral dissolves increasing porosity and creating empty volumes the reactive transport codes face two choices either create mass water and solutes to fill this empty volume or ignore it neither cases are accurate nor satisfactory furthermore reactive transport is generally decoupled from flow meaning that flow produced by the dis appearance of a solid volume is not taken into account to overcome this limitation and provide a strong and accurate coupling between flow and the reactive transport a volume balance of the different phases including water has to be assessed to this end it is thus necessary to take into account the production and consumption of water through chemical reactions the chemical role of water is important in some applications like cement hydration or unsaturated cases examples are given in senger et al 2008 and croisé et al 2011 most reactive transport code treat water as the solvent whose amount is not subject to modifications therefore the evolution of the concentration of one species is directly proportional to the evolution of its mass however when considering the aforementioned cases where water plays a chemical role as a reactant the consumption movement of water can impact the equilibrium of different species e g water being consumed increases the concentrations of the other species which can trigger mineral reactions for that reason if water has to become a primary species it has to be incorporated in the geochemical system as the molality of water is constant reasoning in terms of mass instead of concentrations makes more sense in this paper we present a numerically efficient and accurate method for assessing the production consumption of water in variable porosity cases it consists in writing the conservation equations in terms of mass mol not only this method provides an easy and accurate computation of the equilibrium taking water into account it also allows to accurately compute the volume of the different phases hence if the overall volume increases precipitation of a certain amount of mineral volume this can be linked to a pressure evolution and to the flow problem this method thus allows a volume balance and a coupling with un saturated and multiphase flow and erases the aforementioned problems inherent to variable porosity the work of gamazo et al 2012 improved the description of water within reactive transport simulations by addressing the water as a chemical reactant however it does not address the variable porosity issue or how a production consumption of water and solid species have an impact on the flow while these functionalities are developed for the purpose of gas storage or atmospheric carbonation of concrete they are also applicable to a wide range of applications dealing with variable porosities and saturations the main strengths of this approach are its accuracy numerical efficiency robustness and the fact that its application is valid for different flow problems whether saturated unsaturated or multiphase this constitutes a more accurate approach on variable porosity issues in reactive transport modeling at the rev scale note however that this paper does not address the microstructure evolutions which control the effective transport properties these effects are taken into account using empirical relationships even if their use does not accurately represent the physical behavior of real materials with complex microstructures seigneur et al 2017 this paper is organized as follows section 2 presents the mathematical formulation of the addressed problems section 3 addresses the numerical approaches dedicated to solve them section 4 presents model verifications for different flow regimes they aim at emphasizing different physical behaviors and the numerical robustness of strongly coupled simulations finally section 5 summarizes the main conclusions and perspectives of this work some emphasis will be given to the reactive transport code hytec van der lee et al 2002 2003 which was used to test the approach and applications this code is based on an sia approach it has been used and validated in a wide variety of applications benchmark studies lagneau and van der lee 2010 cement degradation de windt and devillers 2010 and geological storage of gases corvisier et al 2013 sin 2015 2 mathematical formulation 2 1 geochemical system 2 1 1 primary and secondary species the formalism of the primary and secondary species was extensively described in lichtner 1996 in the following we use similar notations i will be used as a subscript for basis species while j will be used as a subscript for secondary species the chemical system contains ns species nsolid solid naq aqueous and ng gaseous species n s n s o l i d n a q n g these species are linked through nr independent equilibrium reactions meaning that n b n s n r species can be arbitrarily chosen as basis species morel and hering 1993 while n d n s n b are the derived secondary species therefore any one of the nd derived species denoted sj can be written in terms of the nb primary species and the set of nr chemical reactions can be written in terms of the same basis species denoted ci so that 1 i 1 n b α i j c i s j such as oh h2o h when equilibrium is considered the molalities of secondary species denoted sj can be expressed from the basis species activities ai and the mass action law 2 s j k j γ j i 1 n b a i α i j where the γi coefficients are the activity coefficients of species i and kj is the thermodynamic equilibrium constant producing sj for aqueous species the activity coefficients relates their concentrations to their activities these coefficients can be computed from different empirical models debye huckel pitzer 1991 b dot helgeson 1969 helgeson s model helgeson et al 1981 can be used to compute the water activity the use of mass action law also is valid for minerals their activities can be chosen as one for pure phase or can be computed using mixing rules for solid solutions mineral reactions can also be kinetically controlled in this case some variations of transition state theory rate law lasaga 1981 are usually chosen to compute the reaction rate of any mineral the latter is written in terms of moles as 3 d n j d t m h 2 o n h 2 o k s 1 q j k j where qj represents the ion activity product k the rate constant of the reaction mol m2 s s is the specific surface m2 g and m h 2 o and n h 2 o respectively refer to the molar mass and the number of moles of water additional factors can be taken into account catalysts or inhibitors monod type relations and others for the liquid gas equilibrium 4 s j g s j a q henry s law relates the activity aj to the fugacity fj at equilibrium through henry s constant hj 5 f s j g h j a s j a q in ideal cases the gas fugacity corresponds to its partial pressure pi henry s law can be written in terms of the basis species formalism so that a similar mass action law can be used for gaseous species the concentration gj of the gaseous species can be computed 6 g j n j ω s g v tot with ω sg and vtot respectively represent the porosity the gas saturation and the local volume meaning that ωsgv tot represents the gas volume using ideal gas law r t g j f s j g this leads to 7 g j h j a s j a q r t while a s j a q is expressed with the mass action law 2 2 1 2 mass formalism for a fully coupled problem with an accurate volume balance a formulation in terms of moles is powerful as it allows a proper mass and volume calculation the total molar amount of each basis species is obtained by multiplying the total concentration by the mass of water we define the total amount in moles of each basis species as ni while the amount in moles of any species is written ni 8 n i n i j 1 n d α j i n j which can be written as 9 n i n i j 1 n d α j i m h 2 o s j let us define the following notation where x can refer to gas solid mineral min aqueous aq immobile or water h2o 10 δ i x 1 if species i of type x 0 otherwise using this notation the mass action law can be written in terms of moles as well 11 s j k j γ j i 1 n b γ i n i m h 2 o α i j δ i a q a i α i j δ i m i n a h 2 o α h 2 o j δ i h 2 o in the latter equation two of the factors in the product always equal one for kinetic minerals which are not part of the basis species eq 3 is solved implicitly 12 n j t δ t n j t δ t m h 2 o n h 2 o t δ t k s 1 q j t δ t k j 2 1 3 resulting system the resulting system of equations consists of nb nonlinear equations for each basis species 13 i n b n i n i j 1 n d α j i n j using eqs 11 and 12 to compute nj this set of equations is solved for the unknowns ni 2 2 reactive transport 2 2 1 general equations when considering transport a distinction has to be made between the mobile hence transportable and immobile species the total mobile and immobile concentrations are respectively denoted ti and t i in mol l of water usually for the un saturated case the aqueous transport equation is written 14 ω s l t i t d ω s l t i t i u l ω s l t i t where ω s l t i t is the reaction rate corresponding to the im mobilization of the primary species i the divergence term corresponds to the diffusive dispersive flux where u l represents the darcy velocity of the fluid phase see section 2 3 d ω sl is the porosity saturation dependent effective diffusion coefficient 2 2 2 mass formalism in the temporal derivatives of eq 14 ω s l c i represents the mobile amount of species i per volume of rock mol lrock to switch towards a mass formulation one needs to replace this term as mi v tot with v tot being the local volume and mi being the total mobile amount of species i 15 m i n i j 1 n d δ j mobile α i j n j now the reactive transport equation can be written in terms of mass 16 1 v tot m i t d ω s l x i x i u l r i s v tot where 17 x i m i n h 2 o v h 2 o let us have a closer look at the latter equation this indicates that if m h 2 o n h 2 o chemically bound water is small compared to the free water and if water density is assumed constant no diffusive transport of water is obtained however for highly saline solutions the solution volume might significantly differ from the water volume the developed method has no limitations regarding these effects the evolution of the density and the shift between solution and water volume could be modeled through the water molar volume v h 2 o taking into account temperature composition or pressure effects to accurately compute water density let us emphasize that n h 2 o represents the actual free water in the system and not the chemically bound water this amount can be modified by the flow and by the geochemical reactions for other species ni incorporates the mobile derived species the chemical mobile water associated with solutes is neglected in that equation for clarity purposes in eq 16 the reaction rate corresponds to 18 r i s j 1 n s δ j immobile α i j n j t writing the two phase reactive transport equations in terms of moles is rather straightforward a gaseous source term is added for the liquid gas equilibrium 19 r i g j 1 n s δ j g a s α i j n j t 20 1 v tot m i l t d l ω s l x i x i u l r i s r i g v tot aqueous 1 v

d t 24 r v s d ω d t 1 v tot j 1 n s δ j solid d n j d t v j 2 3 flow problem in the reactive transport community three main flow regimes are considered first the saturated flow considers a fully saturated porous medium the pore space is filled with water second the unsaturated flow considers the movement of water in an unsaturated medium by taking into account the effects of the gas phase only through the values of the relative permeabilities and capillary pressures while the gas pressure is considered uniform and constant the unsaturated flow simplification does not model the gas phase on its own however in recent years the need for complete simulation of this gas phase has arisen and led to two phase flow simulations hytec treats those different flow regimes whose mathematical formulations are reviewed here the flow problem aims at computing the darcy muskat velocity muskat et al 1937 u α for the different fluid phases α 25 u α k r α κ μ α p α ρ α g in this equation μα is the fluid viscosity kg m s κ is the intrinsic permeability m 2 pα is the fluid pressure pa g is the gravity vector k r α is the relative permeability of the medium to the fluid phase α which expresses the deviation from saturated cases 2 3 1 saturated flow in general the considered saturated flow equation is the diffusivity equation marsily 1981 the latter is based on the continuity equation for the fluid and solid phase 26 ρ l u l ρ l ω t ρ l q v l ρ l r v l ρ s u s ρ s 1 ω t ρ s r v s coupled to the darcy equation 25 for the velocity in the continuity equation q v l represents an external volumetric flux of water which we neglect in the following developments in addition two source terms are added r v s and r v l corresponding to chemical appearance of water or solid defined by eqs 23 and 24 coupling these equations both for the fluid and solid phase leads to the diffusivity equation see marsily 1981 we first obtain 27 ρ l κ μ l p l ρ l g z ρ l 1 ω ω t ρ l ω ρ s ρ s t ω ρ l t ρ l r v l ρ l ω 1 ω r v s from there constitutive equations are used to link the different variables with the liquid pressure introducing the liquid and solid compressibilities βl and βs and an elasticity coefficients αl and αs one can write 28 ρ l t ρ l β l p l t ρ s t ρ s α s β l p l t ω t 1 ω α l α s p l t r v s the only difference with marsily 1981 lies in the solid source term developing further leads to 29 ρ l κ μ l p l ρ l g z ρ l α l α s ρ l ω α s ω β l ρ l p l t ρ l r v s ρ l r v l combining the latter equation β s α s 1 1 ω dividing by ρl and considering ρ l 0 using h z p ρ l g defining the hydraulic conductivity k κ ρ l g μ and considering slow displacements of the solid interfaces we obtain the usual diffusivity equation with two additional source terms 30 s s h t k h r v l r v s with the usual specific storage coefficient 31 s s ρ l ω g β l β s α l ω the source terms were defined in eqs 23 and 24 these correspond to the solid and water sources from the geochemical reactions in the initial version of the diffusivity equation the evolution of porosity was only caused by the evolution of the fluid pressure through the specific storage coefficient now the diffusivity equation incorporates the geochemical reaction terms which can modify the volume of both the water and solid phases let us interpret these chemical source terms if the two source terms compensate each other perfectly i e r v l r v s 0 no impact is observed apart from permeability updates if at one point r v l r v s 0 this leads to an increase of pressure which will impact the flow indeed if a mineral starts precipitating this will push water away this corresponds to a local increase in pressure more generally for hydrated minerals the importance of this coupling will depend on the relative molar volumes of these minerals and the amount of released water this term defines the mineral net volume balance 2 3 2 unsaturated flow the unsaturated flow equation is the richards equation richards 1931 32 θ h t k θ h r v l which has to be coupled with an unsaturated law such as the van genuchten relationship 33 θ h θ r θ s θ r 1 α h n 1 1 n where θ is the volumetric water content representing the volume fraction of water inside a rock its value ranges from 0 and the porosity ω of the rock the water saturation sl is given by 34 s l θ ω when porosity evolves without any production or consumption of water the saturation hence the pressure evolves as well however adding a solid source term in richard s law is not accurate therefore another equation is added for the solid phase and richard s and van genuchten equations are written in terms of saturation instead of water content 35 ω t r v s ω s l t k s l h r v l 2 3 3 two phase flow the two phase flow equations are based on the continuity equations for the two fluid phases 36 ω s α ρ α t ρ α u α ρ α r v α the reaction term ρ α r v α describes the mass of water and gas produced by chemical reactions sin et al 2017 described in details the formulation of the two phase flow to close the system the capillary pressure pc linking the pressures of the two fluids and closure equations between the saturations sα of the two phases are added 37 s l s g 1 38 p g p l p c s the capillary pressure and relative permeability models can be chosen from different models e q van genuchten and nielsen 1985 brooks corey the full system can be written on the basis of two primary variables chosen to be the liquid pressure pl and the gas saturation sg 39 ω t r v s ω 1 s g ρ l t ρ l k r l κ μ l p l ρ l g ρ l r v l ω s g ρ g t ρ g k r g κ μ g p l p c ρ g g ρ g r v g note that similar equations would be obtained for other formulations liquid pressure gas pressure 3 numerical solution the different numerical methods used to tackle the presented problems are here presented with emphasis on the main modifications which have been developed in order to couple the variable porosity with the water balance and the flow 3 1 geochemical system let us focus on how the geochemical equilibrium is solved if it is written in terms of moles instead of molalities in general and in hytec in particular a newton raphson nr procedure is used to solve the nonlinear geochemical system in eq 13 the set of basis species always includes water minerals at equilibrium and aqueous species therefore kinetic minerals gaseous species and other aqueous species are part of the secondary species at each iteration of the newton raphson procedure the amount in moles of each basis species is computed as well as the amount of water allowing the computation of the concentrations this means that for the sia approach the geochemical structure can be maintained allowing a rather simple implementation of this method only the jacobian structure needs to be modified for the nr procedure the derivatives of the different equations need to be taken into account the amount of a derived species is obtained by the mass action law eq 11 for aqueous and gaseous species and eq 12 for kinetic mineral species therefore one can write the required derivatives of the nr procedure 40 n j n i α i j n j n i α i j s j c i δ i a q 1 also for the minerals at equilibrium which are part of the basis species 41 n j n i 0 δ i m i n 1 and δ j a q 1 as the mass action law depends on the activities of the mineral species and not their concentrations the derivatives of the kinetic minerals can be computed from eq 3 this means that for all aqueous species the jacobian structure remains the same thus the modifications of the geochemical solving procedure are limited one only needs to add the water derivatives the dependence of the aqueous concentration of one derived species j on the amount of water is denoted λj 42 λ j i 1 n b α i j δ i a q leading to 43 n j n h 2 o λ j n j n h 2 o 3 2 reactive transport for sia approach the mass formalism does not modify significantly the reactive transport algorithm the only difference lies in the fact that the chemistry has to be provided with the amount of water present in each cell which is computationally free fig 1 describes the temporal evolution of the key variables and introduce some notation which will be used in the following for clarity purposes 3 2 1 computing the source terms for flow the most important step is to compute the different source terms for the flow coupling reactive transport is now able to modify the water mass and the porosity let us denote by fl and rt the values of before and after the reactive transport procedure the source terms will be written as 44 q v s ω f l ω r t 45 q v l m h 2 o r t m h 2 o f l ρ h 2 o v tot 3 2 2 convergence for the sia approach the convergence of the reactive transport iterative loop is obtained when the following conditions are satisfied 46 n i t δ t m 1 n i t δ t m ϵ r t s n i t δ t m 1 n i g t δ t m 1 n i g t δ t m ϵ r t g n i g t δ t m 1 indicating that the immobile and gas masses reach a fixed point between two successive iterations m 1 and m 3 3 flow problem 3 3 1 saturated and unsaturated flow the linear saturated flow eq 30 with the two volumetric source terms is solved straightforwardly 47 s s h t δ t h t δ t k h r v l r v s these source terms which take the same form for the different regimes are 48 r v s q v s δ t 49 r v l q v l δ t in hytec the resolution of the unsaturated flow eqs 35 relies on celia s method celia et al 1990 the porosity is first updated to modify the saturation with the same initial water content and we add the water source term to the richard s equation and follow celia s procedure 3 3 2 two phase flow problem the first equation for the solid phase guarantees that the porosity used for the 2 phase flow calculation matches the porosity computed by the reactive transport indeed the flow does not impact the porosity 50 ω f l t δ t ω r t t δ t q v s δ t which guarantees that the porosity computed by the flow matches the porosity computed by the geochemical solver at the previous timestep the resolution scheme of the two other equations is extensively described in sin et al 2017 and sin 2015 3 4 general algorithm to summarize the previous sections the global algorithm is schematically depicted in fig 2 for an sia approach such as in hytec it starts with the computation of the flow the flow solver requires the solid and liquid reaction rates r v s and r v l as well as the porosity to take into account permeability updates these quantities are used to assess the fluid pressure profiles to compute the darcy velocities u l which are used for the transport calculations the evolution of saturation due to the flow solver unsaturated two phase is translated into a modification of the water mass note that even though the mass of solids is unaffected by flow their concentrations might evolve due to the movement of water the transport is computed based on the diffusive and computed adective fluxes the chemistry yields the liquid solid gas equilibrium in particular it provides at each iteration the evolution of the mass of water hence saturation porosity and concentrations of solid species this iterative procedure is performed until convergence defined by eq 46 4 numerical simulations and results 4 1 introduction to the simulations in this section two one dimensional verification cases for hytec are presented the parameters were chosen in order to obtain a strong coupling between the flow and reactive transport though the choice of parameters was not motivated by modeling a real experiment the different simulations loosely represent some actual reactive transport problems the saturated flow simulation models the precipitation and dissolution of different minerals these reactions consume and release water to create flow in an initially diffusive problem the two phase flow simulation represents a coupled drying and clogging phenomenon of a partially saturated material the aim of these simulations is to demonstrate the accuracy of the method 4 1 1 reactive system the following simulations will be based upon the same model geochemical system the set of aqueous chemical species are given in table 1 three different minerals were chosen in this simulation their characteristics are summed up in table 2 let us define their water balance as the volume of water released by the dissolution of one mole of the mineral and their net volume change ν tot as the difference in volume generated by the dissolution of one mole of the mineral 51 ν j tot α j h 2 o v h 2 o v j one can also write 52 r v s r v l 1 v tot j 1 n s δ j solid ν j tot d n j d t which emphasizes the fact that this net volume change of a mineral leads to the volumic source terms in the following cases even though the net volume changes are always negative the sign of r v s r v l will be modified when considering dissolution or precipitation through the simulations the minerals will be controlled by the thermodynamic equilibrium 4 2 additional parameters 4 2 1 simplifying assumptions for the solid liquid gas equilibrium the activity and fugacity coefficients are equal to unity ideal solution and gas assumptions while the activity of minerals at equilibrium is 1 furthermore an isothermal flow is considered with a constant water density for the two phase flow problem the liquid and gas viscosities are assumed constant 4 2 2 evolution of transport properties the effective diffusion coefficient d e f f α is subject to modifications during the dissolution precipitation reactions this dependence is taken from empirical relationships archie s law eq 53 from archie 1942 is taken for saturated cases for unsaturated and two phase cases millington quirk eq 54 from millington and quirk 1961 is used for the impact on permeability kozeny carman relation eq 55 is used 53 d eff ω d eff ω 0 ω ω c ω 0 ω c n 54 d eff α ω s α d α ω 4 3 s α 10 3 55 k k 0 1 ω 0 1 ω 2 ω ω 0 3 4 3 precipitation and dissolution reactions in a saturated system 4 3 1 description the first simulation considers a saturated flow and is depicted in fig 3 three different zones are considered left center and right for a total of 60 nodes the different geometrical and hydrodynamic parameters used are summed up in table 3 while initial chemistry is given in table 4 this simulation involves three main mineral reactions mineral amin is going to dissolve from the central reservoir while producing water two aqueous species baq and caq counter diffuse towards each other to form a mineral bcmin whose precipitation consumes water also the diffusion of d allows for the precipitation of admin using aaq released from the dissolution of amin the boundary conditions consider a constant concentration of species through time corresponding to the initial reservoir chemistries the initial pressure and boundary conditions are uniform hence an initial diffusive regime the simulation is performed over 10 years the goal of this simulation is to illustrate how the geochemical reactions are inducing a flow in an initially purely diffusive problem the choice of parameters was influenced by a desire to produce strong effects and is likely not representative of any experimental results 4 3 2 results fig 4 shows the evolution of porosity and minerals volume fractions over time one can observe the progressive dissolution from both ends of mineral amin this dissolution increases the porosity and has a negative volume balance i e r v l r v s 0 decreasing the pressure this generates a flowrate water is drawn in from both constant head boundaries as shown in fig 5 a positive water flow indicates water going towards the positive value of x the movement of water generated by the dissolution of mineral amin is represented after 146 days in red in fig 5 meanwhile on the left side of the domain the precipitation of mineral admin occurs which induces an asymmetric behavior for the flowrate as this mineral is present aaq remains on the left end of the dissolving rock this reduces the concentration gradient of aaq slowing down the dissolution of amin on the left compared to its dissolution on the right at later times as baq and caq diffuse towards each other mineral bcmin starts precipitating this precipitation consumes water but has a positive volume balance r v l r v s 0 which leads to a pressure increase this pushes water away as is represented by the blue curve after 2 years in fig 5 as water is consumed during the precipitation of bcmin the concentration of aaq increases and the solution becomes supersaturated with regards to mineral amin the precipitation of bcmin leads to the further precipitation of amin however this impact remains limited because the amount of aaq is limited and that the induced flow pushes water away let us note that transport remain dominated by diffusion advective flux less than two orders of magnitude than diffusive flux this is confirmed by the symmetric concentration profile of the tracer after 2 years as can be seen in fig 6 this precipitation of bcmin which has a large molar volume sharply decreases the porosity at larger timescales the porosity and the transport properties have dropped significantly after ten years the porosity is so low that no further diffusion occurs beyond the precipitation front mineral bcmin starts dissolving on both sides of the front to provide baq resp caq on right resp left side of the system very low diffusion at the peak prevents dissolution in this thin zone sharpening the front this phenomenon decreases the pressure and water is again sucked in the material as can be seen after 8 years in fig 5 the simulation is very effective and no numerical instabilities happen even at very low porosities 4 4 two phase flow 4 4 1 description this simulation couples a two phase flow with a gaseous component dg which when dissolved in water will react with mineral amin to form admin 56 d g d h h 2 o with logk 5 the geometry is simple and consists of one rock filled with mineral amin in contact with a constant low saturation area on the left representing an infinite atmosphere the material consists of mineral amin the geochemical system is the same than for the previous simulation with the addition of one gaseous species the atmospheric zone has a constant saturation through time and a constant partial pressure of gaseous component dg these conditions correspond to the left boundary condition the material zone is initially partially saturated and is modeled through 50 nodes flow gas diffusion and dissolution and mineral reactions are studied over one year only the left end of the material is in contact with this atmosphere this drying problem coupled with dissolution precipitation of minerals can be linked to a process such as the atmospheric carbonation of partially saturated concrete the hydrodynamic parameters and the initial chemical conditions are respectively given in tables 5 and 6 the simulation and its geometry is depicted in fig 7 for this simulation capillary pressure and relative permeability laws are required van genuchten relations were chosen using parameters given in table 7 57 p c s l p e 1 s l s r l 1 s r l s r g 1 n 1 n 58 k r g s g s g s r g 1 s r l s r g 1 s g s r g 1 s r l s r g 1 n 2 n 59 k r l s l s

days the drying is almost complete before the complete drying advection is the main transport process after which transport is dominated by gas diffusion on the other hand the dissolution of mineral amin increases the porosity and releases water as can be seen in figs 9 as porosity and water mass increase the effect on saturation is limited one can see a small discontinuity on the saturation curves located at the dissolution front at early times in this simulation water flows out of the system and some water is produced by the dissolution of mineral amin fig 10 shows the evolution of the different minerals one can observe the dissolution of mineral amin as well as the precipitation of mineral admin after one year this precipitation has occurred within the 10 first centimeters of the material 5 conclusion and perspectives in this paper we proposed a new approach to compute the geochemical equilibrium based on a conservation of moles instead of concentration this approach exhibits several advantages 1 its implementation into an existing reactive transport code is rather easy it only requires slightly changing the numerical approach within the core of the jacobian structure of the geochemical calculation so that the system is expressed in terms of mass rather than concentrations in hytec for instance these modifications are almost transparent 2 it allows for a correct assessment of the water mass evolution through chemical reactions and flow 3 as the amounts in moles of both water and solids are obtained this allows an easy computation of the different volumes 4 this volume assessment can be easily coupled to flow as simple source term 5 this is an implicit and accurate treatment of the mass balance problem furthermore the numerical efficiency seems to have been improved the average amount of required iterations for the geochemical and reactive transport solvers have decreased additionally no unstable behavior was witnessed even at very low porosities the different simulations performed are running faster than similar simulations without porosity update however let us indicate that this numerical improvement was not extensively verified the fact that the role of water has now be reconciled between the reactive transport and flow problems new developments are available for example the physical and chemical activity of water can be properly estimated the latter can have a significant impact in some cases for instance when dealing with hydration of minerals with limited amounts of water available cement and concrete hydration or very low saturation the kinetics of the dissolution and precipitation reaction can be strongly influenced by the amount of water present the main limitation regarding the proposed approach is the fact that the water density was assumed to be independent from pressure while this assumption might not be suited in certain cases the developped approach does not prevent from addressing an equation of state for the water to link its volume to the pressure in that case the water density could be modeled to be dependent of temperature chemical composition and pressure for reactive transport modellng implicating density dependent flow this would have to be implemented the only modifications in the proposed equations would appear while dealing with the source terms for the flow coupling and to modify the water molar volume for the reactive transport problem these implementations would probably take place within an additional more detailed coupling with temperature and heat transfers finally this method allows to consider an impact of geochemical reactions on matrix properties consequently it implicitly reflects a feedback on the pressure field this feature can be used when modeling effective and shear stresses so that a role of precipitated dissolved minerals will implicitly be taken into account this evolution will be related to the ability of a rock to release the water through its permeability and its ability to accommodate the pressure through its specific storage coefficient if the geochemical source term in the flow equations are too important for the material to handle this might be used to assess when or whether a material could be mechanically damaged this method could therefore help improve the chemistry transport mechanical coupling acknowledgments the

742,tidal asymmetry in estuaries and lagoons tidal basins controls residual sediment transport and quantifying tidal asymmetry is important for understanding the factors contributing to long term morphological changes asymmetry in peak flood and ebb currents peak current asymmetry pca controls residual transport of coarse sediment and asymmetry in slack water duration preceding flood and ebb currents slack water asymmetry swa controls residual transport of fine sediment pca and swa are analyzed herein for newport bay a tidal embayment in southern california based on the skewness of tidal currents predicted for several stations by a hydrodynamic model use of skewness for tidal asymmetry is relatively new and offers several advantages over a traditional harmonic method including the ability to resolve variability over a wide range of time scales newport bay is externally forced by mixed oceanic tides that are shown to be ebb dominant because of shorter falling tide than rising tide both pca and swa indicate ebb dominance that favors export of coarse and fine sediments respectively to the coastal ocean however we show that the ebb dominance of swa is derived from the basin geometry and not the external forcing while ebb dominance of pca is linked to the external forcing and the basin geometry we also show that tidal flats in newport bay play an important role in maintaining ebb dominated transport of both coarse and fine sediments loss of tidal flats could weaken pca and reverse swa to become flood dominant specifically we show that sea level rise 0 8 m that inundates tidal flats will begin to weaken ebb dominant pca and swa and that sea level rise 1 0 m will reverse swa to become flood dominant this feedback mechanism is likely to be important for predicting long term evolution of tidal basins under accelerating sea level rise keywords tidal basin tidal asymmetry sediment transport sea level rise morphodynamics 1 introduction tidal estuaries and lagoons around the world have been altered by human activities including coastal development disruption of sediment supplies and armoring of shorelines un 2017 impacts include loss of 65 of sea grass and wetland habitat and depletion of 90 of formerly important species lotze et al 2006 in southern california for instance over 48 of coastal wetlands have been lost since the middle 19th century and the remaining systems are actively managed at a substantial cost for multiple objectives including flood defense navigation recreation and water quality stein et al 2014 furthermore accelerating rates of sea level rise are coming into focus as a major consideration for future planning globally averaged sea levels could rise 0 3 1 2 m by 2100 depending on emission scenarios kopp et al 2014 as a result tidal basins can anticipate a shift towards deeper water with less inter tidal and upper marsh habitat particularly in developed coasts where inland migration of marshlands is constrained thorne et al 2016 2018 however this trend may be offset through changes to sediment management practices including source control and enhanced marsh accretion doing so calls for an understanding of the natural processes at work especially the processes that control long term morphological changes residual transport of sediment from the cycling of flood and ebb tides serves as an important control on medium to long term morphological changes within tidal basins dronkers 1986 sediment transport rates generally scale with a third power of tidal currents so small differences between flood and ebb currents can cause large differences in residual transport postma 1961 dronkers 1986 de swart and zimmerman 2009 the transport behavior of coarse e g sand and fine e g silt and clay sediment is markedly different because the former is predominantly transported as bed load where the transport rate is a power function of current velocities with negligible time lag effects while the latter is mixed throughout water column where it is predominantly transported as suspended load and strongly affected by time lag effects on initial motion and settling postma 1954 groen 1967 van rijn 1993 distinct indicators of residual sediment transport have been developed based on tidal asymmetry differences between maximum tidal currents during flood and ebb peak current asymmetry pca serve as an indicator of residual flux of coarse sediment and differences in slack water duration preceding flood and ebb slack water asymmetry swa serve to indicate residual flux of fine sediment dronkers 1986 similarly net sediment transport in near shore is linked to asymmetry in currents from short waves ruessink et al 2009 chen et al 2018 in practice pca and swa are not easily computed because long records of tidal currents are not readily available and thus an alternative indicator is tidal duration asymmetry tda characterizing inequality between rising and falling tidal periods in tidal water levels a water level record showing a shorter rising tide than falling tide will lead to stronger flood currents than ebb currents flood asymmetry conversely ebb dominance is featured by a shorter falling tide than rising tide that produces stronger ebb currents than flood currents tda is much more widely discussed because of availability of tidal water level data however tda is not a substitute for pca tidal currents are far more sensitive to basin geometry e g channels shoals and tide flats and external forcing e g river discharge than surface water heights thus pca is still preferred in indicating residual sediment transport there have been numerous studies of tidal asymmetry based on time series of water level and currents with the goal of deepening understanding of residual sediment transport and long term morphological change postma 1961 dronkers 1986 de swart and zimmerman 2009 leonardi and plater 2017 previous research indicates that tidal basins with limited tidal flats and insignificant river discharges are flood dominated speer and aubrey 1985 lanzoni and seminara 2002 guo et al 2016a inter tidal flats tend to promote stronger ebb currents and may result in ebb dominance in short tidal basins fitzgerald and nummedal 1983 friedrichs and aubrey 1988 and freshwater discharge intuitively strengthens ebb currents and elongates falling tides godin 1985 guo et al 2014 side channels developed for marinas and harbors can also impact tidal asymmetry alebregtse and de swart 2014 roos and schuttelaars 2015 stark et al 2017 oceanic tidal forcing is also an important consideration as it can impart tidal asymmetry on tidal basins based on its astronomical constituents woodworth et al 2005 nidzieko 2010 jewell et al 2012 in particular mixed tidal regimes an amplitude ratio ao1 ak1 as2 am2 in the range of 0 25 1 5 found along the west coast of the u s are characterized by ebb dominance nidzieko 2010 however flood dominance within west coast basins remains possible for example in the tijuana river estuary in california an elevated sill at the mouth severely restricts ebb flows and thus promotes flood dominance nidzieko 2010 clearly asymmetry in currents within tidal basins depends on numerous factors related to basin geometry and external tidal forcing we can therefore expect that residual sediment transport processes regulating long term morphological change will be sensitive to human interventions that alter basin geometry e g dredging development and habitat restoration and sea level rise which deepens basins moreover site specific assessment of residual sediment transport can help to inform coastal management activities such as channel dredging sediment placement and wetland restoration in this study we use a hydrodynamic model of an important tidal basin in southern california newport bay to simulate tidal currents and enable analysis of pca and swa following calibration of the model the pca and swa are quantified and then additional scenarios are modeled to examine how pca and swa respond to a changes to basin geometry tidal flats and side channels influenced by human activity and b sea level rise tidal asymmetry is computed using a skewness method as recommended by nidzieko 2010 for mixed tidal regimes traditional methods to quantify tidal asymmetry include harmonic indicators such as phase differences and amplitude ratios of the interacting tidal constituents e g 2θm2 θm4 and θo1 θk1 θm2 θ indicates the phase e g speer and aubrey 1985 friedrichs and aubrey 1988 van de kreeke and robaczewska 1993 hoitink et al 2003 one advantage of the skewness method lies in its ability to cope with mixed tidal regime see more discussions in section 4 1 variants of the skewness method have been developed to distinguish the contribution of different tidal interactions song et al 2011 to explore fortnightly variations of tidal duration asymmetry guo et al 2016b and tidal current asymmetry gong et al 2016 combining a hydrodynamic model to simulate tidal currents with the skewness method to compute asymmetry offers a practical approach to anticipate the effects of proposed basin alterations and sea level rise on residual transport of coarse and fine sediment this article is organized as follows section 2 will introduce the study area the modeling setup and the skewness method used to quantify tidal asymmetry section 3 presents modeling results including impacts of basin geometry and sea level rise on tidal asymmetry discussion of the advantages and shortcomings of the skewness method and the implication of the model results are in section 4 section 5 provides a brief summary of the findings in this work 2 method and materials 2 1 site description newport bay located 60 km south of los angeles in california is a short 10 km micro tidal mean tidal range of 1 2 m basin with broad inter tidal flats in the upper bay landward of pacific coast highway pch and ample side channels in the lower bay seaward of pch fig 1 the upper bay is a wildlife refuge dominated by tidal marsh habitat and its subtidal channels are periodically dredged as part of active sediment management programs to restore channel volume the lower bay is a pleasure craft harbor with extensive shoreline development that is vulnerable to coastal flooding without major interventions future sea level rise will result in chronic flooding of the developed areas of the lower bay floodrise project 2017 and a transformation of upper bay to a system dominated by subtidal habitat loss of inter tidal marshes thorne et al 2016 2018 hence there is interest in coordinating sediment management programs e g reducing the frequency of dredging with natural processes i e tide and or river induced residual sediment transport and consequent morphological changes to cost effectively adapt to higher sea levels while balancing multiple management objectives because of its historical development newport bay departs from the archetypal funnel geometry of tidal estuaries the bay mouth is fixed by two jetties built in the 1930 s the inter tidal flats in the upper bay account for nearly 70 of the wet surface area at high tide the side channels in the lower bay provide extra space for tidal prism the subtidal channel depth averages 5 m within newport bay with limited changes along the basin axially because of dredging activities newport bay is externally forced by mixed tides where the ratio of diurnal and semi diurnal tidal amplitudes ao1 ak1 am2 as2 is 0 76 the mean tidal range is about 1 2 m at the mouth the m2 is the most important astronomical constituent followed by k1 o1 s2 n2 and p1 the other constituents are of secondary importance given amplitudes less than 0 05 m the overtide e g m4 and compound tides e g ms4 and mn4 have insignificant amplitudes 0 01 m in adjacent coastal waters limited tidal deformation because of open coasts and narrow shelf and inside newport bay mainly due to small basin length thus their impacts in causing tidal asymmetry are negligible due to a small basin length the tides in newport bay have a standing wave form with only small amplification several cm in the far western and northern reaches the phase changes of the astronomical constituents are small e g the high water time lag is 25 min at the northern head compared to the bay mouth hence the rise and fall of water levels is fairly uniform throughout the basin freshwater input from san diego creek is small 1 m3 s in the dry season late spring through early fall leading to well mixed and highly saline conditions but episodic storms lasting hours to few days can occur from late fall through early spring and cause river discharge of 100 1000 m3 s and pulses of sediment supply and partial stratification in the upper bay trimble 2003 2 2 model setup the delft3d model lesser et al 2004 is applied to produce time series of tidal currents for analysis of pca and swa in newport bay the model domain encompasses all subtidal and inter tidal topography bathymetry and extends several km offshore of the mouth the model uses a curvilinear grid with a variable resolution as fine as 5 m within the bay and up to 500 m offshore ground elevations are specified using a digital elevation model that combines sonar measurements of bathymetry with lidar measurements of subaerial topography gallien et al 2011 tidal dynamics are resolved using depth integrated shallow water equations that assume a hydrostatic pressure distribution a uniform vertical distribution of horizontal velocity and a constant fluid density tidal forcing of the model is achieved by specifying water level at the offshore boundary and river forcing from san diego creek is achieved by specifying streamflow at the northern head of the basin the model is calibrated against water levels and tidal currents measured during dry weather periods by adjusting resistance parameters as described in the supplementary material see figs s6 and s7 in the digital supplementary material model scenarios considered in this study are defined by tidal and riverine forcing and basin geometry a baseline scenario representative of present day dry weather dynamics is configured assuming a small freshwater inflow 1 m3 s and mixed oceanic tides using six tidal constituents m2 s2 n2 o1 k1 and p1 with amplitudes and phases taken from noaa https co ops nos noaa gov gauge 9 410 660 additional scenarios are considered to examine the role of basin geometry and sea level rise on tidal asymmetry scenarios to address the impacts of basin geometry are defined by excluding the inter tidal flats in the upper bay the tidal flats with an elevation above the mean low water are removed and only the subtidal channel remains and excluding the side channels in the lower bay impose thin dams at the connections of the side channels see fig 1 the impacts of sea level rise are examined by scenarios considering sea level rise in the range of 0 1 5 m 15 scenarios with an increments of 0 1 m on the present day morphology moreover an additional simulation is run by imposing a symmetric sinusoidal m2 component only at the seaward boundary all model scenarios are run for a three month period between may and august which captures perigean spring tides at the summer solstice 2 3 skewness approach pca and swa are estimated using a skewness measure computed as follows 1 γ x 1 n 1 i 1 n x i x 3 1 n 1 i 1 n x i x 2 3 2 where γ is skewness xi is the time series of sample signals x is the mean value expected value of the samples and n is the number of equal distanced hourly time series data numerical models of tidal basins are generally configured to output time series of tidal water level η or tidal currents u which provides a basis for several alternative measures of tidal asymmetry table 1 in particular pca is estimated using eq 1 assuming x u swa is computed assuming x du dt which corresponds to velocity acceleration gong et al 2016 in addition tda is also computed from time derivatives of tidal water levels i e x dη dt see table 1 and the supplementary material the skewness method eq 1 has been widely used in earth sciences such as in detecting asymmetry in turbulence velocity fluctuations basu et al 2007 and wave generated currents ruessink et al 2009 although with small modifications of the input signals for different purposes one assumption of the skewness method is that the input signal is stationary which is satisfied in tide dominated environments with insignificant or constant river discharges as indicated in table 1 skewness calculations for pca and swa are made using a velocity threshold to minimize noise in results the threshold is a lower limit for pca and an upper limit for swa and it is not necessarily the same as the critical velocity for initial sediment motion preliminary analysis suggests that the absolute value of the skewness indicators of pca and swa will slightly increase and decrease respectively with an increasing velocity threshold in the range of 0 1 0 3 m s but not change sign using the same velocity threshold enables consistent comparison of the results between different scenarios furthermore skewness is computed using a moving window 25 h to capture subtidal variations additional information is provided in the supplementary material 3 results 3 1 baseline tidal currents and asymmetry tidal currents are maximum in the middle segment of newport bay between big canyon and pch and exhibit strong spring neap variations and daily inequality as shown in fig 2 for a 24 h period in june under spring fig 2a and neap fig 2b conditions the magnitude of peak ebb velocities tend to be larger than flood peak velocities at spring tides and the opposite is true at neap tide fig 2 note that the changes in tidal heights across newport bay are relatively uniform because of short basin length pca and swa computed using a velocity threshold of 0 15 m s fry and aubrey 1990 for the entire three month record indicates ebb dominance throughout the system tidal asymmetry values for all scenarios are presented in table 2 pca indicates ebb dominated transport of coarse sediment cross the basin with values of 0 36 0 41 0 30 and 0 70 at bay mouth pch big canyon and salt bridge respectively it is consistent with negative skewness derived from tidal water level data which indicates overall shorter falling tide than rising tide see the supplement similarly swa values of 0 29 1 72 1 79 and 1 05 at the bay mouth pch big canyon and salt bridge respectively indicate ebb dominated transport of fine sediment throughout the system spatially swa is the strongest in the middle segment of the bay between pch and big canyon where tidal currents are highest fig 3 presents temporal variability in pca and swa at three stations for the three month model simulation period based on a 25 h skewness calculation window both signals exhibit fortnightly variability but differ in shape and phase pca is similar across these stations with mostly negative values that typically reach a maximum absolute value sometime between spring and neap tides furthermore positive values occur for a relatively short periods near the occurrence of neap tides when peak flood velocities are larger than peak ebb currents fig 3 negative peaks in swa generally occur with the largest spring tide and positive swa are rare fig 3 also shows that spatially the swa values are clearly greater in magnitude in the middle reaches of newport bay than at the mouth note that the subtidal swa and pca are not in phase the preceding analysis is repeated with external forcing by a symmetric m2 tide this produces nearly equal peak ebb and flood velocities and it results in relatively small and negligible pca compared to the baseline scenario but measurable swa that is comparable to the baseline scenario table 2 and fig s8 it suggests that tidal asymmetry embedded in the external mixed tides is the main control on pca inside the basin whereas swa is internally generated inside the basin 3 2 impact of basin geometry model scenarios reveal the impacts of side channels and tidal flats on tidal current magnitude and on pca and swa fig 4 shows that excluding the inter tidal flats in the upper bay results in slightly smaller currents and the ebb currents decrease at a larger rate than flood currents especially in the upper bay as shown at big canyon and pch it is because the inter tidal storage volume and tidal prism decrease in the absence of tidal flats thus tidal currents decrease moreover fig 4 also shows that excluding the side channels in the lower bay will reduce current magnitude at bay mouth specifically tidal currents at the mouth are reduced by about 50 compared to the baseline scenario whereas the changes at pch and big canyon are negligible it is because the tidal prism at the bay mouth is significantly reduced by excluding the side channels because a smaller surface area and volume has to be drained excluding tidal flats and side channels will increase the ebb dominance at spring tides and increase the flood dominance at neap tides particularly at the bay mouth see fig s9 in the supplement the net pca for 3 month data under scenarios representing major perturbations of system geometry shows that the system will remain ebb dominant with respect to residual coarse sediment transport since pca remains negative under all scenarios as shown in fig 5 and table 2 however the ebb dominance is weakened in the lower bay pch to mouth from loss of tidal flats which points to the potential for increasing accumulation of coarse sediment in lower bay calculation of swa table 2 and fig 5 shows that major changes in system geometry have the potential to reverse the residual transport of fine sediment in particular fig 5 shows that swa is positive flood dominance without tidal flats and increases with distance from the mouth to big canyon it subsequently decreases with further distance towards the head of the system these changes suggest that loss of tidal flats in the upper bay will enhance accumulation of fine sediment therein especially north of big canyon which will potentially stimulate formation of tidal flats as a negative feedback swa would remain negative ebb dominance with the loss of side channels in the lower bay and this condition would continue to favor export of fine sediment to the coastal ocean tidal current strength reduces remarkably as well as current asymmetry in the scenario n4 excluding tidal flats and forced by an m2 tide only compared to the scenario n2 including tidal flats see fig s8 in the supplement pca in scenario n4 is small as that in the scenario n2 forced by m2 tide and with tidal flats while its swa is similar to that in the scenario n3 forced by six tidal constituents but without tidal flats table 2 these sensitivity model results show that the inter tidal flats exert a primary control on swa 3 3 impact of sea level rise on pca and swa tidal surface amplitude changes are negligible with sea level rise 1 5 m because of a short basin length and synchronous tides whereas both ebb and flood currents increase from a proportional increase in tidal prism relative to channel cross sectional area fig 4 shows that the sensitivity of currents to 1 5 m of sea level rise is larger in the upper bay pch and big canyon than the mouth this effect is due to sea level rise causing a more significant increase of tidal prism owing to the presence extensive inter tidal flats in the upper bay than the increase of cross sectional area at pch and big canyon due to confined section profile see fig s10 in the supplement therefore current velocities increase under sea level rise compared to the baseline scenario fig 6 shows the impacts of 0 1 5 m of sea level rise on pca and swa and the response is nonlinear sea level rise by 1 5 m reduces pca and its impacts tend to be much stronger at spring tides in the upper bay see fig s9 at the bay mouth pca is slightly enlarged by sea level rise 0 6 m and but it is weakened with larger sea level rise fig 6a inside the bay ebb pca is non uniformly weakened with increasing sea level rise up to 1 5 m regarding swa fig 6b shows that sea level rise 0 8 m results in increasing ebb dominance in the lower bay pch to bay mouth but decreasing ebb asymmetry in the upper bay big canyon to salt bridge more importantly a major change in swa is predicted for sea level rise 0 8 m swa nearly vanishes in the lower bay and switches to flood asymmetry in the upper bay under a high sea level rise i e low water slack becomes shorter than high water slack table 2 and fig 6b this results from low water slack periods becoming shorter than high water slack periods these variations suggest that swa is more sensitive to sea level rise than pca and the upper bay is more sensitive to sea level rise more than the lower bay it is because the mean sea level will change the water depth over tidal flats in the upper bay thus altering the slack water asymmetry the inflection point of 0 6 0 8 m corresponds to a change in the hypsometry of upper bay whereby topography is relatively flat at lower elevations and relatively steep at higher elevations hence the transition to flood dominance occurs as tidal flats are inundated by high sea levels and surface area increases with increasing water level at a slower rate see fig s11 in the supplement 4 discussion 4 1 advantage and shortcoming of the skewness method we see that tidal asymmetry in newport bay exhibits strong subtidal variability with respect to its nature and magnitude see figs 3 and s6 similar subtidal variations of tidal asymmetry are also reported in previous studies for instance fortnightly variations of tidal asymmetry occur in both diurnal and mixed tidal regimes ranasinghe and pattiaratchi 2000 guo et al 2016b gong et al 2016 stronger tidal asymmetry is generally expected at spring tide compared to neap tides wang et al 1999 these facts indicate that strong subtidal variations of tidal asymmetry are not unique in newport bay but can be a universal phenomenon the skewness method can be also used to quantify the contribution of different tidal interactions e g m2 o1 k1 and s2 k1 p1 when combined with tidal harmonic data song et al 2011 overall the skewness method has several strengths in characterizing tidal asymmetry regarding 1 its ability to resolve subtidal variations of tidal asymmetry and 2 its ability to measure the net effects of multiple tidal interactions which possibly augment or reduce each other in creating net tidal asymmetry the harmonic method is also able to reveal fortnightly variations of tidal asymmetry when considering the modulation effect of s2 wang et al 1999 the shortcoming of the skewness proxy lies in its lack of a strong physical background the skewness method provides a complementary option for tidal asymmetry characterization in mixed tidal regime except the harmonic method 4 2 controls on tidal asymmetry in newport bay the sensitivity simulations results confirm that the oceanic tides control the ebb dominance of pca inside newport bay the oceanic tides off the southern californian coasts are characterized by ebb dominance of tda nidzieko 2010 in tidal surface waves it is featured by higher high water preceding lower low water see figure s6 leading to stronger ebb currents than flood currents and consequent ebb pca in harmonic the ebb dominance is mainly controlled by the m2 o1 k1 triad interactions with a phase difference of θo1 θk1 θm2 in the range of 180 360 such phase differences may vary spatially in long basins such as san francisco bay and chesapeake bay where loss of inter tidal flats to reclamation and sea level rise have modification effects on tidal wave propagation and deformation godin and martinez 1994 holleman and stacey 2014 lee et al 2017 in short basins such as newport bay however changes to basin topography have limited effects on tidal wave propagation except for prominent features such as sills at the outlet capable of restricting tide propagation nidzieko 2010 inter tidal flats are the secondary factor in inducing slightly stronger ebb currents and ebb pca the impacts of inter tidal flats on pca are much more apparent at pch because of the presence of broad inter tidal flats inland of pch the tidal amplitude to water depth ratio in newport bay is 0 12 and the mean ratio of inter tidal flat storage volume to channel volume is 1 0 in the upper bay and 0 3 for newport bay as a whole suggesting a hypsometry favoring ebb dominance according to friedrichs and aubrey 1988 moreover we find that the inter tidal flats are the prime control of ebb swa in newport bay sea level rise can have significant impacts on tidal asymmetry because mean water depth increases with sea level rise while tidal wave amplitude changes little thus the tidal amplitude to water depth ratio decreases as well as the ratio of inter tidal flat storage volume to channel volume this effect is similar to that of decreasing tidal flat storage which decreases ebb dominance friedrichs and aubrey 1988 fortunato and oliveira 2005 the tidal flats in the upper bay have an elevation in the range of 0 5 1 5 m and the upper bay is surrounded by steep bluffs therefore high sea level rise will convert nearly all the inter tidal flats into subtidal flats see fig s11 in the supplement thus substantially eliminating inter tidal flat storage volume and its impacts on swa this feedback can explain the swa switch from ebb to flood by high sea level rise see table 2 and fig 6 4 3 implications on residual sediment transports the ebb dominance of both pca and swa in the present day newport bay favors seaward export of both coarse and fine sediments this is beneficial for maintaining channel depth for navigation and channel volume for reducing flood risk but it is to the disadvantage of tidal flat accretion and salt marsh conservation under rising sea levels sea level rise points to an overall decrease of ebb pca and swa inside the bay suggesting that seaward sediment export will become smaller the higher sea level rises this represents a potentially important feedback mechanism that could reduce tidal flats and salt marsh loss in response to sea level rise another significant factor controlling tidal flats accretion in newport bay is deposition of river supplied sediment sediment is supplied to the system mainly by episodic storm flows that occur primarily in winter and spring it leaves deposits in upper bay which are later transported seaward by tides the relatively weak but persisting flushing by tides likely explains the historical infilling of the upper bay and tidal flat formation therein moreover these dynamics suggest that long term morphological change in newport bay is characterized by episodic filling from storm events human intervention e g dredging and regarding for marsh restoration and long term redistribution by tidal currents models that couple natural hydro morphodynamic and biological processes e g kirwan and murray 2007 with human processes di baldassarre et al 2015 and sea level rise are needed to improve future predictions of coastal changes in newport bay and other coastal basins several other factors besides pca and swa measured along the main basin axis contribute to residual sediment transport and subsequent morphodynamic changes in tidal basins for example residual circulations between meandering channels and tidal flats can induce suspended sediment transport toward flats in the presence of settling and scour lag effects de swart and zimmerman 2009 both temporal spatial lag groen 1967 and spatial settling lag effects postma 1954 can cause significant net transport of fine sediments toward tidal flats gravitational circulation generated by interactions between freshwater and intruded salt water will trap sediment in the lower bay by reducing seaward sediment flushing tidal asymmetry differs from these processes of local importance because its impacts on residual sediment transport are evaluated at large space and long time scales 5 conclusions tidal asymmetry can be expressed in several ways useful for analysis of residual transport of coarse and fine sediments and here two measures of tidal asymmetry i e pca and swa based on a statistical skewness method are developed to better understand how basin geometry and sea level rise change tidal asymmetry model result shows that newport bay is overall ebb dominant regarding both pca and swa with stronger peak ebb velocities than peak flood and shorter high water slack than low water slack a moving window analysis also reveals stronger ebb dominance at spring tides than neap tides sensitivity scenarios suggest that the oceanic tides are the major contributor of ebb dominated pca and inter tidal flats are a major contributor to ebb dominated swa in the absence of tidal flats ebb dominant transport of coarse sediment is weakened in the lower bay and ebb dominant transport of fine sediment is reversed throughout the bay to become flood dominant the side channels in the lower bay enlarge tidal currents at the mouth and increase both pca and swa small changes in sea levels can slightly increase pca and swa at the bay mouth while high sea level rise will cause overall decrease of pca and swa throughout the basin and eventually a switch from ebb to flood swa in the upper bay these findings imply net seaward transport of both coarse and fine sediments in newport bay the fact that newport bay s capacity to export sediment is reduced with increasing sea level rise points to a potentially important feedback mechanism to slow or possibly stop the transformation of inter tidal wetland habitat to subtidal wetland habitat which has been predicted for numerous tidal basins in california by 2100 thorne et al 2016 2018 this highlights the need for coupling of

742,tidal asymmetry in estuaries and lagoons tidal basins controls residual sediment transport and quantifying tidal asymmetry is important for understanding the factors contributing to long term morphological changes asymmetry in peak flood and ebb currents peak current asymmetry pca controls residual transport of coarse sediment and asymmetry in slack water duration preceding flood and ebb currents slack water asymmetry swa controls residual transport of fine sediment pca and swa are analyzed herein for newport bay a tidal embayment in southern california based on the skewness of tidal currents predicted for several stations by a hydrodynamic model use of skewness for tidal asymmetry is relatively new and offers several advantages over a traditional harmonic method including the ability to resolve variability over a wide range of time scales newport bay is externally forced by mixed oceanic tides that are shown to be ebb dominant because of shorter falling tide than rising tide both pca and swa indicate ebb dominance that favors export of coarse and fine sediments respectively to the coastal ocean however we show that the ebb dominance of swa is derived from the basin geometry and not the external forcing while ebb dominance of pca is linked to the external forcing and the basin geometry we also show that tidal flats in newport bay play an important role in maintaining ebb dominated transport of both coarse and fine sediments loss of tidal flats could weaken pca and reverse swa to become flood dominant specifically we show that sea level rise 0 8 m that inundates tidal flats will begin to weaken ebb dominant pca and swa and that sea level rise 1 0 m will reverse swa to become flood dominant this feedback mechanism is likely to be important for predicting long term evolution of tidal basins under accelerating sea level rise keywords tidal basin tidal asymmetry sediment transport sea level rise morphodynamics 1 introduction tidal estuaries and lagoons around the world have been altered by human activities including coastal development disruption of sediment supplies and armoring of shorelines un 2017 impacts include loss of 65 of sea grass and wetland habitat and depletion of 90 of formerly important species lotze et al 2006 in southern california for instance over 48 of coastal wetlands have been lost since the middle 19th century and the remaining systems are actively managed at a substantial cost for multiple objectives including flood defense navigation recreation and water quality stein et al 2014 furthermore accelerating rates of sea level rise are coming into focus as a major consideration for future planning globally averaged sea levels could rise 0 3 1 2 m by 2100 depending on emission scenarios kopp et al 2014 as a result tidal basins can anticipate a shift towards deeper water with less inter tidal and upper marsh habitat particularly in developed coasts where inland migration of marshlands is constrained thorne et al 2016 2018 however this trend may be offset through changes to sediment management practices including source control and enhanced marsh accretion doing so calls for an understanding of the natural processes at work especially the processes that control long term morphological changes residual transport of sediment from the cycling of flood and ebb tides serves as an important control on medium to long term morphological changes within tidal basins dronkers 1986 sediment transport rates generally scale with a third power of tidal currents so small differences between flood and ebb currents can cause large differences in residual transport postma 1961 dronkers 1986 de swart and zimmerman 2009 the transport behavior of coarse e g sand and fine e g silt and clay sediment is markedly different because the former is predominantly transported as bed load where the transport rate is a power function of current velocities with negligible time lag effects while the latter is mixed throughout water column where it is predominantly transported as suspended load and strongly affected by time lag effects on initial motion and settling postma 1954 groen 1967 van rijn 1993 distinct indicators of residual sediment transport have been developed based on tidal asymmetry differences between maximum tidal currents during flood and ebb peak current asymmetry pca serve as an indicator of residual flux of coarse sediment and differences in slack water duration preceding flood and ebb slack water asymmetry swa serve to indicate residual flux of fine sediment dronkers 1986 similarly net sediment transport in near shore is linked to asymmetry in currents from short waves ruessink et al 2009 chen et al 2018 in practice pca and swa are not easily computed because long records of tidal currents are not readily available and thus an alternative indicator is tidal duration asymmetry tda characterizing inequality between rising and falling tidal periods in tidal water levels a water level record showing a shorter rising tide than falling tide will lead to stronger flood currents than ebb currents flood asymmetry conversely ebb dominance is featured by a shorter falling tide than rising tide that produces stronger ebb currents than flood currents tda is much more widely discussed because of availability of tidal water level data however tda is not a substitute for pca tidal currents are far more sensitive to basin geometry e g channels shoals and tide flats and external forcing e g river discharge than surface water heights thus pca is still preferred in indicating residual sediment transport there have been numerous studies of tidal asymmetry based on time series of water level and currents with the goal of deepening understanding of residual sediment transport and long term morphological change postma 1961 dronkers 1986 de swart and zimmerman 2009 leonardi and plater 2017 previous research indicates that tidal basins with limited tidal flats and insignificant river discharges are flood dominated speer and aubrey 1985 lanzoni and seminara 2002 guo et al 2016a inter tidal flats tend to promote stronger ebb currents and may result in ebb dominance in short tidal basins fitzgerald and nummedal 1983 friedrichs and aubrey 1988 and freshwater discharge intuitively strengthens ebb currents and elongates falling tides godin 1985 guo et al 2014 side channels developed for marinas and harbors can also impact tidal asymmetry alebregtse and de swart 2014 roos and schuttelaars 2015 stark et al 2017 oceanic tidal forcing is also an important consideration as it can impart tidal asymmetry on tidal basins based on its astronomical constituents woodworth et al 2005 nidzieko 2010 jewell et al 2012 in particular mixed tidal regimes an amplitude ratio ao1 ak1 as2 am2 in the range of 0 25 1 5 found along the west coast of the u s are characterized by ebb dominance nidzieko 2010 however flood dominance within west coast basins remains possible for example in the tijuana river estuary in california an elevated sill at the mouth severely restricts ebb flows and thus promotes flood dominance nidzieko 2010 clearly asymmetry in currents within tidal basins depends on numerous factors related to basin geometry and external tidal forcing we can therefore expect that residual sediment transport processes regulating long term morphological change will be sensitive to human interventions that alter basin geometry e g dredging development and habitat restoration and sea level rise which deepens basins moreover site specific assessment of residual sediment transport can help to inform coastal management activities such as channel dredging sediment placement and wetland restoration in this study we use a hydrodynamic model of an important tidal basin in southern california newport bay to simulate tidal currents and enable analysis of pca and swa following calibration of the model the pca and swa are quantified and then additional scenarios are modeled to examine how pca and swa respond to a changes to basin geometry tidal flats and side channels influenced by human activity and b sea level rise tidal asymmetry is computed using a skewness method as recommended by nidzieko 2010 for mixed tidal regimes traditional methods to quantify tidal asymmetry include harmonic indicators such as phase differences and amplitude ratios of the interacting tidal constituents e g 2θm2 θm4 and θo1 θk1 θm2 θ indicates the phase e g speer and aubrey 1985 friedrichs and aubrey 1988 van de kreeke and robaczewska 1993 hoitink et al 2003 one advantage of the skewness method lies in its ability to cope with mixed tidal regime see more discussions in section 4 1 variants of the skewness method have been developed to distinguish the contribution of different tidal interactions song et al 2011 to explore fortnightly variations of tidal duration asymmetry guo et al 2016b and tidal current asymmetry gong et al 2016 combining a hydrodynamic model to simulate tidal currents with the skewness method to compute asymmetry offers a practical approach to anticipate the effects of proposed basin alterations and sea level rise on residual transport of coarse and fine sediment this article is organized as follows section 2 will introduce the study area the modeling setup and the skewness method used to quantify tidal asymmetry section 3 presents modeling results including impacts of basin geometry and sea level rise on tidal asymmetry discussion of the advantages and shortcomings of the skewness method and the implication of the model results are in section 4 section 5 provides a brief summary of the findings in this work 2 method and materials 2 1 site description newport bay located 60 km south of los angeles in california is a short 10 km micro tidal mean tidal range of 1 2 m basin with broad inter tidal flats in the upper bay landward of pacific coast highway pch and ample side channels in the lower bay seaward of pch fig 1 the upper bay is a wildlife refuge dominated by tidal marsh habitat and its subtidal channels are periodically dredged as part of active sediment management programs to restore channel volume the lower bay is a pleasure craft harbor with extensive shoreline development that is vulnerable to coastal flooding without major interventions future sea level rise will result in chronic flooding of the developed areas of the lower bay floodrise project 2017 and a transformation of upper bay to a system dominated by subtidal habitat loss of inter tidal marshes thorne et al 2016 2018 hence there is interest in coordinating sediment management programs e g reducing the frequency of dredging with natural processes i e tide and or river induced residual sediment transport and consequent morphological changes to cost effectively adapt to higher sea levels while balancing multiple management objectives because of its historical development newport bay departs from the archetypal funnel geometry of tidal estuaries the bay mouth is fixed by two jetties built in the 1930 s the inter tidal flats in the upper bay account for nearly 70 of the wet surface area at high tide the side channels in the lower bay provide extra space for tidal prism the subtidal channel depth averages 5 m within newport bay with limited changes along the basin axially because of dredging activities newport bay is externally forced by mixed tides where the ratio of diurnal and semi diurnal tidal amplitudes ao1 ak1 am2 as2 is 0 76 the mean tidal range is about 1 2 m at the mouth the m2 is the most important astronomical constituent followed by k1 o1 s2 n2 and p1 the other constituents are of secondary importance given amplitudes less than 0 05 m the overtide e g m4 and compound tides e g ms4 and mn4 have insignificant amplitudes 0 01 m in adjacent coastal waters limited tidal deformation because of open coasts and narrow shelf and inside newport bay mainly due to small basin length thus their impacts in causing tidal asymmetry are negligible due to a small basin length the tides in newport bay have a standing wave form with only small amplification several cm in the far western and northern reaches the phase changes of the astronomical constituents are small e g the high water time lag is 25 min at the northern head compared to the bay mouth hence the rise and fall of water levels is fairly uniform throughout the basin freshwater input from san diego creek is small 1 m3 s in the dry season late spring through early fall leading to well mixed and highly saline conditions but episodic storms lasting hours to few days can occur from late fall through early spring and cause river discharge of 100 1000 m3 s and pulses of sediment supply and partial stratification in the upper bay trimble 2003 2 2 model setup the delft3d model lesser et al 2004 is applied to produce time series of tidal currents for analysis of pca and swa in newport bay the model domain encompasses all subtidal and inter tidal topography bathymetry and extends several km offshore of the mouth the model uses a curvilinear grid with a variable resolution as fine as 5 m within the bay and up to 500 m offshore ground elevations are specified using a digital elevation model that combines sonar measurements of bathymetry with lidar measurements of subaerial topography gallien et al 2011 tidal dynamics are resolved using depth integrated shallow water equations that assume a hydrostatic pressure distribution a uniform vertical distribution of horizontal velocity and a constant fluid density tidal forcing of the model is achieved by specifying water level at the offshore boundary and river forcing from san diego creek is achieved by specifying streamflow at the northern head of the basin the model is calibrated against water levels and tidal currents measured during dry weather periods by adjusting resistance parameters as described in the supplementary material see figs s6 and s7 in the digital supplementary material model scenarios considered in this study are defined by tidal and riverine forcing and basin geometry a baseline scenario representative of present day dry weather dynamics is configured assuming a small freshwater inflow 1 m3 s and mixed oceanic tides using six tidal constituents m2 s2 n2 o1 k1 and p1 with amplitudes and phases taken from noaa https co ops nos noaa gov gauge 9 410 660 additional scenarios are considered to examine the role of basin geometry and sea level rise on tidal asymmetry scenarios to address the impacts of basin geometry are defined by excluding the inter tidal flats in the upper bay the tidal flats with an elevation above the mean low water are removed and only the subtidal channel remains and excluding the side channels in the lower bay impose thin dams at the connections of the side channels see fig 1 the impacts of sea level rise are examined by scenarios considering sea level rise in the range of 0 1 5 m 15 scenarios with an increments of 0 1 m on the present day morphology moreover an additional simulation is run by imposing a symmetric sinusoidal m2 component only at the seaward boundary all model scenarios are run for a three month period between may and august which captures perigean spring tides at the summer solstice 2 3 skewness approach pca and swa are estimated using a skewness measure computed as follows 1 γ x 1 n 1 i 1 n x i x 3 1 n 1 i 1 n x i x 2 3 2 where γ is skewness xi is the time series of sample signals x is the mean value expected value of the samples and n is the number of equal distanced hourly time series data numerical models of tidal basins are generally configured to output time series of tidal water level η or tidal currents u which provides a basis for several alternative measures of tidal asymmetry table 1 in particular pca is estimated using eq 1 assuming x u swa is computed assuming x du dt which corresponds to velocity acceleration gong et al 2016 in addition tda is also computed from time derivatives of tidal water levels i e x dη dt see table 1 and the supplementary material the skewness method eq 1 has been widely used in earth sciences such as in detecting asymmetry in turbulence velocity fluctuations basu et al 2007 and wave generated currents ruessink et al 2009 although with small modifications of the input signals for different purposes one assumption of the skewness method is that the input signal is stationary which is satisfied in tide dominated environments with insignificant or constant river discharges as indicated in table 1 skewness calculations for pca and swa are made using a velocity threshold to minimize noise in results the threshold is a lower limit for pca and an upper limit for swa and it is not necessarily the same as the critical velocity for initial sediment motion preliminary analysis suggests that the absolute value of the skewness indicators of pca and swa will slightly increase and decrease respectively with an increasing velocity threshold in the range of 0 1 0 3 m s but not change sign using the same velocity threshold enables consistent comparison of the results between different scenarios furthermore skewness is computed using a moving window 25 h to capture subtidal variations additional information is provided in the supplementary material 3 results 3 1 baseline tidal currents and asymmetry tidal currents are maximum in the middle segment of newport bay between big canyon and pch and exhibit strong spring neap variations and daily inequality as shown in fig 2 for a 24 h period in june under spring fig 2a and neap fig 2b conditions the magnitude of peak ebb velocities tend to be larger than flood peak velocities at spring tides and the opposite is true at neap tide fig 2 note that the changes in tidal heights across newport bay are relatively uniform because of short basin length pca and swa computed using a velocity threshold of 0 15 m s fry and aubrey 1990 for the entire three month record indicates ebb dominance throughout the system tidal asymmetry values for all scenarios are presented in table 2 pca indicates ebb dominated transport of coarse sediment cross the basin with values of 0 36 0 41 0 30 and 0 70 at bay mouth pch big canyon and salt bridge respectively it is consistent with negative skewness derived from tidal water level data which indicates overall shorter falling tide than rising tide see the supplement similarly swa values of 0 29 1 72 1 79 and 1 05 at the bay mouth pch big canyon and salt bridge respectively indicate ebb dominated transport of fine sediment throughout the system spatially swa is the strongest in the middle segment of the bay between pch and big canyon where tidal currents are highest fig 3 presents temporal variability in pca and swa at three stations for the three month model simulation period based on a 25 h skewness calculation window both signals exhibit fortnightly variability but differ in shape and phase pca is similar across these stations with mostly negative values that typically reach a maximum absolute value sometime between spring and neap tides furthermore positive values occur for a relatively short periods near the occurrence of neap tides when peak flood velocities are larger than peak ebb currents fig 3 negative peaks in swa generally occur with the largest spring tide and positive swa are rare fig 3 also shows that spatially the swa values are clearly greater in magnitude in the middle reaches of newport bay than at the mouth note that the subtidal swa and pca are not in phase the preceding analysis is repeated with external forcing by a symmetric m2 tide this produces nearly equal peak ebb and flood velocities and it results in relatively small and negligible pca compared to the baseline scenario but measurable swa that is comparable to the baseline scenario table 2 and fig s8 it suggests that tidal asymmetry embedded in the external mixed tides is the main control on pca inside the basin whereas swa is internally generated inside the basin 3 2 impact of basin geometry model scenarios reveal the impacts of side channels and tidal flats on tidal current magnitude and on pca and swa fig 4 shows that excluding the inter tidal flats in the upper bay results in slightly smaller currents and the ebb currents decrease at a larger rate than flood currents especially in the upper bay as shown at big canyon and pch it is because the inter tidal storage volume and tidal prism decrease in the absence of tidal flats thus tidal currents decrease moreover fig 4 also shows that excluding the side channels in the lower bay will reduce current magnitude at bay mouth specifically tidal currents at the mouth are reduced by about 50 compared to the baseline scenario whereas the changes at pch and big canyon are negligible it is because the tidal prism at the bay mouth is significantly reduced by excluding the side channels because a smaller surface area and volume has to be drained excluding tidal flats and side channels will increase the ebb dominance at spring tides and increase the flood dominance at neap tides particularly at the bay mouth see fig s9 in the supplement the net pca for 3 month data under scenarios representing major perturbations of system geometry shows that the system will remain ebb dominant with respect to residual coarse sediment transport since pca remains negative under all scenarios as shown in fig 5 and table 2 however the ebb dominance is weakened in the lower bay pch to mouth from loss of tidal flats which points to the potential for increasing accumulation of coarse sediment in lower bay calculation of swa table 2 and fig 5 shows that major changes in system geometry have the potential to reverse the residual transport of fine sediment in particular fig 5 shows that swa is positive flood dominance without tidal flats and increases with distance from the mouth to big canyon it subsequently decreases with further distance towards the head of the system these changes suggest that loss of tidal flats in the upper bay will enhance accumulation of fine sediment therein especially north of big canyon which will potentially stimulate formation of tidal flats as a negative feedback swa would remain negative ebb dominance with the loss of side channels in the lower bay and this condition would continue to favor export of fine sediment to the coastal ocean tidal current strength reduces remarkably as well as current asymmetry in the scenario n4 excluding tidal flats and forced by an m2 tide only compared to the scenario n2 including tidal flats see fig s8 in the supplement pca in scenario n4 is small as that in the scenario n2 forced by m2 tide and with tidal flats while its swa is similar to that in the scenario n3 forced by six tidal constituents but without tidal flats table 2 these sensitivity model results show that the inter tidal flats exert a primary control on swa 3 3 impact of sea level rise on pca and swa tidal surface amplitude changes are negligible with sea level rise 1 5 m because of a short basin length and synchronous tides whereas both ebb and flood currents increase from a proportional increase in tidal prism relative to channel cross sectional area fig 4 shows that the sensitivity of currents to 1 5 m of sea level rise is larger in the upper bay pch and big canyon than the mouth this effect is due to sea level rise causing a more significant increase of tidal prism owing to the presence extensive inter tidal flats in the upper bay than the increase of cross sectional area at pch and big canyon due to confined section profile see fig s10 in the supplement therefore current velocities increase under sea level rise compared to the baseline scenario fig 6 shows the impacts of 0 1 5 m of sea level rise on pca and swa and the response is nonlinear sea level rise by 1 5 m reduces pca and its impacts tend to be much stronger at spring tides in the upper bay see fig s9 at the bay mouth pca is slightly enlarged by sea level rise 0 6 m and but it is weakened with larger sea level rise fig 6a inside the bay ebb pca is non uniformly weakened with increasing sea level rise up to 1 5 m regarding swa fig 6b shows that sea level rise 0 8 m results in increasing ebb dominance in the lower bay pch to bay mouth but decreasing ebb asymmetry in the upper bay big canyon to salt bridge more importantly a major change in swa is predicted for sea level rise 0 8 m swa nearly vanishes in the lower bay and switches to flood asymmetry in the upper bay under a high sea level rise i e low water slack becomes shorter than high water slack table 2 and fig 6b this results from low water slack periods becoming shorter than high water slack periods these variations suggest that swa is more sensitive to sea level rise than pca and the upper bay is more sensitive to sea level rise more than the lower bay it is because the mean sea level will change the water depth over tidal flats in the upper bay thus altering the slack water asymmetry the inflection point of 0 6 0 8 m corresponds to a change in the hypsometry of upper bay whereby topography is relatively flat at lower elevations and relatively steep at higher elevations hence the transition to flood dominance occurs as tidal flats are inundated by high sea levels and surface area increases with increasing water level at a slower rate see fig s11 in the supplement 4 discussion 4 1 advantage and shortcoming of the skewness method we see that tidal asymmetry in newport bay exhibits strong subtidal variability with respect to its nature and magnitude see figs 3 and s6 similar subtidal variations of tidal asymmetry are also reported in previous studies for instance fortnightly variations of tidal asymmetry occur in both diurnal and mixed tidal regimes ranasinghe and pattiaratchi 2000 guo et al 2016b gong et al 2016 stronger tidal asymmetry is generally expected at spring tide compared to neap tides wang et al 1999 these facts indicate that strong subtidal variations of tidal asymmetry are not unique in newport bay but can be a universal phenomenon the skewness method can be also used to quantify the contribution of different tidal interactions e g m2 o1 k1 and s2 k1 p1 when combined with tidal harmonic data song et al 2011 overall the skewness method has several strengths in characterizing tidal asymmetry regarding 1 its ability to resolve subtidal variations of tidal asymmetry and 2 its ability to measure the net effects of multiple tidal interactions which possibly augment or reduce each other in creating net tidal asymmetry the harmonic method is also able to reveal fortnightly variations of tidal asymmetry when considering the modulation effect of s2 wang et al 1999 the shortcoming of the skewness proxy lies in its lack of a strong physical background the skewness method provides a complementary option for tidal asymmetry characterization in mixed tidal regime except the harmonic method 4 2 controls on tidal asymmetry in newport bay the sensitivity simulations results confirm that the oceanic tides control the ebb dominance of pca inside newport bay the oceanic tides off the southern californian coasts are characterized by ebb dominance of tda nidzieko 2010 in tidal surface waves it is featured by higher high water preceding lower low water see figure s6 leading to stronger ebb currents than flood currents and consequent ebb pca in harmonic the ebb dominance is mainly controlled by the m2 o1 k1 triad interactions with a phase difference of θo1 θk1 θm2 in the range of 180 360 such phase differences may vary spatially in long basins such as san francisco bay and chesapeake bay where loss of inter tidal flats to reclamation and sea level rise have modification effects on tidal wave propagation and deformation godin and martinez 1994 holleman and stacey 2014 lee et al 2017 in short basins such as newport bay however changes to basin topography have limited effects on tidal wave propagation except for prominent features such as sills at the outlet capable of restricting tide propagation nidzieko 2010 inter tidal flats are the secondary factor in inducing slightly stronger ebb currents and ebb pca the impacts of inter tidal flats on pca are much more apparent at pch because of the presence of broad inter tidal flats inland of pch the tidal amplitude to water depth ratio in newport bay is 0 12 and the mean ratio of inter tidal flat storage volume to channel volume is 1 0 in the upper bay and 0 3 for newport bay as a whole suggesting a hypsometry favoring ebb dominance according to friedrichs and aubrey 1988 moreover we find that the inter tidal flats are the prime control of ebb swa in newport bay sea level rise can have significant impacts on tidal asymmetry because mean water depth increases with sea level rise while tidal wave amplitude changes little thus the tidal amplitude to water depth ratio decreases as well as the ratio of inter tidal flat storage volume to channel volume this effect is similar to that of decreasing tidal flat storage which decreases ebb dominance friedrichs and aubrey 1988 fortunato and oliveira 2005 the tidal flats in the upper bay have an elevation in the range of 0 5 1 5 m and the upper bay is surrounded by steep bluffs therefore high sea level rise will convert nearly all the inter tidal flats into subtidal flats see fig s11 in the supplement thus substantially eliminating inter tidal flat storage volume and its impacts on swa this feedback can explain the swa switch from ebb to flood by high sea level rise see table 2 and fig 6 4 3 implications on residual sediment transports the ebb dominance of both pca and swa in the present day newport bay favors seaward export of both coarse and fine sediments this is beneficial for maintaining channel depth for navigation and channel volume for reducing flood risk but it is to the disadvantage of tidal flat accretion and salt marsh conservation under rising sea levels sea level rise points to an overall decrease of ebb pca and swa inside the bay suggesting that seaward sediment export will become smaller the higher sea level rises this represents a potentially important feedback mechanism that could reduce tidal flats and salt marsh loss in response to sea level rise another significant factor controlling tidal flats accretion in newport bay is deposition of river supplied sediment sediment is supplied to the system mainly by episodic storm flows that occur primarily in winter and spring it leaves deposits in upper bay which are later transported seaward by tides the relatively weak but persisting flushing by tides likely explains the historical infilling of the upper bay and tidal flat formation therein moreover these dynamics suggest that long term morphological change in newport bay is characterized by episodic filling from storm events human intervention e g dredging and regarding for marsh restoration and long term redistribution by tidal currents models that couple natural hydro morphodynamic and biological processes e g kirwan and murray 2007 with human processes di baldassarre et al 2015 and sea level rise are needed to improve future predictions of coastal changes in newport bay and other coastal basins several other factors besides pca and swa measured along the main basin axis contribute to residual sediment transport and subsequent morphodynamic changes in tidal basins for example residual circulations between meandering channels and tidal flats can induce suspended sediment transport toward flats in the presence of settling and scour lag effects de swart and zimmerman 2009 both temporal spatial lag groen 1967 and spatial settling lag effects postma 1954 can cause significant net transport of fine sediments toward tidal flats gravitational circulation generated by interactions between freshwater and intruded salt water will trap sediment in the lower bay by reducing seaward sediment flushing tidal asymmetry differs from these processes of local importance because its impacts on residual sediment transport are evaluated at large space and long time scales 5 conclusions tidal asymmetry can be expressed in several ways useful for analysis of residual transport of coarse and fine sediments and here two measures of tidal asymmetry i e pca and swa based on a statistical skewness method are developed to better understand how basin geometry and sea level rise change tidal asymmetry model result shows that newport bay is overall ebb dominant regarding both pca and swa with stronger peak ebb velocities than peak flood and shorter high water slack than low water slack a moving window analysis also reveals stronger ebb dominance at spring tides than neap tides sensitivity scenarios suggest that the oceanic tides are the major contributor of ebb dominated pca and inter tidal flats are a major contributor to ebb dominated swa in the absence of tidal flats ebb dominant transport of coarse sediment is weakened in the lower bay and ebb dominant transport of fine sediment is reversed throughout the bay to become flood dominant the side channels in the lower bay enlarge tidal currents at the mouth and increase both pca and swa small changes in sea levels can slightly increase pca and swa at the bay mouth while high sea level rise will cause overall decrease of pca and swa throughout the basin and eventually a switch from ebb to flood swa in the upper bay these findings imply net seaward transport of both coarse and fine sediments in newport bay the fact that newport bay s capacity to export sediment is reduced with increasing sea level rise points to a potentially important feedback mechanism to slow or possibly stop the transformation of inter tidal wetland habitat to subtidal wetland habitat which has been predicted for numerous tidal basins in california by 2100 thorne et al 2016 2018 this highlights the need for coupling of

743,we derive an idealized model of a gravel sand river bifurcation and analyze its stability properties the model requires nodal point relations that describe the ratio of the supply of gravel and sand to the two downstream branches the model predicts changes in bed elevation and bed surface gravel content in the two bifurcates under conditions of a constant water discharge sediment supply base level and channel width and under the assumption of a branch averaged approach of the bifurcates the stability analysis reveals more complex behavior than for unisize sediment three to five equilibrium solutions exist rather than three in addition we find that under specific parameter settings the initial conditions in the bifurcates determine to which of the equilibrium states the system evolves our approach has limited predictive value for real bifurcations due to neglecting several effects e g transverse bed slope alternate bars upstream flow asymmetry and bend sorting yet it provides a first step in addressing mixed size sediment mechanisms in modeling the dynamics of river bifurcations keywords river bifurcation mixed size sediment idealized model equilibrium stability analysis 1 introduction river bifurcations or diffluences are found in alluvial fans braided rivers anabranching rivers deltas cut off channels diversions for flood control or water intakes and in constructed side channels that are part of river restoration schemes once a bifurcation is initiated a downstream channel or bifurcate or distributary continues to deepen as long as the sediment transport capacity exceeds the sediment supply to the channel sediment transport in a channel consists of bed material load i e bed load and suspended bed material load and wash load church 2006 paola 2001 as wash load is typically assumed to be distributed uniformly over the water column it is assumed to be partitioned over the bifurcates according to the ratio of the water discharge bed material load however partitions over the bifurcates in a less straightforward manner the partitioning of sediment in streams dominated by suspended bed material load depends on the initial flow depth and

sediment and bank erosion miori et al 2006 zolezzi et al 2006 the conditions in the area just upstream of the bifurcation the transverse distribution of water and sediment over the upstream channel

fraction content of the flow and the other one with a larger fraction content of the sediment load federici and paola 2003 hardy et al 2011 kleinhans et al 2008 van dijk et al 2014 and transverse sediment sorting due to bend flow frings and kleinhans 2008 sloff et al 2003 sloff and mosselman 2012 the partitioning of the sediment load over the bifurcates determines whether the bifurcation develops towards a stable state with two open downstream branches or a state in which the water discharge in one of the branches continues to increase at the expense of the other branch the latter case may lead to the silting up of one of the downstream channels under such conditions a one channel configuration is a stable equilibrium solution of the bifurcation system wang et al 1995 yet in literature this situation is often termed an unstable bifurcation burge 2006 federici and paola 2003 as the two channel system ceases to exist early one dimensional reduced complexity models describing the development towards the equilibrium states of two bifurcates have been developed for bed load transport in sand bed rivers wang et al 1995 bed load transport in gravel bed rivers bolla pittaluga et al 2003 and suspended bed material load slingerland and smith 1998 such reduced complexity models allow for the computation of the partitioning of the water discharge as the water surface elevation at the bifurcation point must be equal between the three reaches the sediment partitioning however depends on the geometry of the bifurcation and the three dimensional flow structure which obviously cannot be reproduced by a one dimensional model a one dimensional model therefore requires a nodal point relation that describes the partitioning of the sediment load over the bifurcates wang et al 1995 were the first to introduce a nodal point relation describing the partitioning of the sediment supplied from upstream over the bifurcates they then apply a simpler form of their nodal point relation s 1 s 2 q 1 q 2 k where s 1 2 is the rate of sediment supply per unit width to branches 1 and 2 and q 1 2 is the water supply per unit width to branches 1 and 2 to analyse the stability of the solutions to the equilibrium morphodynamic state of the bifurcates studying avulsion development slingerland and smith 1998 introduce a nodal point relation that originates from integration of the vertical concentration profile of the suspended sediment alternative nodal point relations have been developed by bolla pittaluga et al 2003 who account for the effects of a transverse bed slope that induces lateral sediment transport to the deeper bifurcate and kleinhans et al 2008 who account for the effects of an upstream bend both of which will be addressed in further detail below pioneering work on bifurcation dynamics using a nodal point relation was conducted by wang et al 1995 they assume a constant water discharge and sediment supply rate in the upstream channel a constant and equal base level in the two bifurcating branches and unisize sediment conditions they apply the engelund and hansen 1967 sediment transport relation without a threshold for significant transport s un where s denotes the sediment transport capacity per unit width u the depth averaged flow velocity and n is the exponent in the power law load relation n 5 they find that for k n 3 the equilibrium solution where one of the bifurcates closes is stable whereas for k n 3 the equilibrium solution with two open branches is stable despite these early results a model for k is still lacking also slingerland and smith 1998 reveal that a bifurcation or avulsion develops towards a stable state with two open downstream branches or a state in which one channel becomes the dominant channel at the expense of the other branch in such strongly idealized one dimensional analyses two dimensional and three dimensional effects near the bifurcation point are not readily accounted for one of these effects is the bulle effect bulle 1926 dutta et al 2017 van der mark and mosselman 2013 which indicates a situation where the sediment supply to a diversion channel i e a channel that branches off the main channel under a certain angle is significantly larger than the diversion channel s fraction content of the water discharge this effect is associated with secondary flow e g thomas et al 2011 another effect is the difference in bed elevation that is associated with a difference in flow depth between the two bifurcates e g bolla pittaluga et al 2003 kleinhans et al 2013 this bed elevation difference also denoted using the term inlet step tends to increase the sediment supply to the deeper bifurcate e g slingerland and smith 1998 which acts as a stabilizing mechanism although mixed size sediment systems may reveal behavior that is essentially different from unisize sediment systems blom et al 2017a 2017b 2016 mosselman and sloff 2008 sinha and parker 1996 so far the influence of noncohesive mixed size sediment on bifurcation dynamics has not been studied explicitly wash load suspended bed material load and bed load church 2006 paola 2001 are expected to respond differently to the above mentioned mechanisms hackney et al 2017 mixed size sediment effects are the following 1 as the vertical profile of sediment concentration is less uniform over depth for coarse sediment i e coarse sediment tends to concentrate more strongly near the bed coarse sediment tends to be affected more by an inlet step than fine sediment slingerland and smith 1998 2 the effect of the transverse bed slope on lateral transport upstream of the bifurcation depends on grain size where coarse sediment is affected by the transverse bed slope more strongly than fines parker and andrews 1985 3 the presence of a bend upstream of the bifurcation typically leads to bend sorting and a coarser sediment supply to the distributary in the outer bend than to the one in the inner bend frings and kleinhans 2008 sloff et al 2003 sloff and mosselman 2012 4 alternate bar formation and geometry appear to be affected by the grain size distribution of the sediment mixture bertoldi and tubino 2005 lanzoni 2000 our objective is to assess the elementary consequences of the introduction of mixed size sediment mechanisms in the modelling of the dynamics of a river bifurcation to this end we follow wang et al 1995 s approach and its simple nodal point relation with associated limitations and simplifications we neglect the effects of vegetation cohesive sediment bank erosion alternate bars or a bend in the upstream channel as well as the bulle effect and the transverse slope effect we extend their model to conditions with bed material load of a two fraction sediment mixture consisting of gravel and sand this implies the need for two nodal point relations describing the ratio of respectively the gravel and sand supply to the two bifurcates we study the stability of the equilibrium states of the bifurcates in an engineered river characterized by a fixed channel width the proposed analysis and model are applicable to both cases shown in fig 1 a bifurcation system with two bifurcates that are characterized by the same base level and a side channel system we set up a model describing the equilibrium solutions of the mixed sediment bifurcation system section 2 we determine its equilibrium solutions section 3 we derive a system of ordinary differential equations for the flow depth and bed surface texture in the bifurcates section 4 and perform a stability analysis of the equilibrium solutions section 5 the analysis also provides insight on the time scale of the evolution towards the stable equilibrium solutions section 6 2 model of the equilibrium state in this section we strongly simplify the situation of a gravel sand river bifurcation describe the problem from a mathematical point of view and list the governing equations to this end we consider an engineered river with a fixed channel width that may vary between the branches a temporally constant water discharge in the upstream branch i e branch 0 in fig 1 and a temporally constant gravel supply rate and constant sand supply rate to the upstream branch under equilibrium conditions t 0 without subsidence uplift and particle abrasion the equation describing conservation of sediment mass i e the exner equation reduces to the stationary exner equation s i x 0 where si denotes the sediment transport capacity in branch i the subscript i indicates branch i and x is the streamwise coordinate in other words by definition the sediment transport capacity si equals the sediment supply to branch i s i where the bar indicates the sediment supply for simplicity we apply the engelund and hansen power law load relation engelund and hansen 1967 1 s i b i m i u i n in which m i g i d with d denoting a characteristic grain size g i 0 05 c i 3 r 2 g 1 2 ui the depth averaged flow velocity bi the channel width ci the chézy friction coefficient g denotes the gravitational acceleration and r the submerged density r ρ s ρ ρ where ρs and ρ are the mass density of respectively sediment and water for simplicity we assume that mi does not vary between the branches m i m which implies that also the friction coefficient and the coefficient g do not vary between the branches c i c g i g combination of eq 1 with the stationary exner equation illustrates that under equilibrium conditions where the channel width and friction do not vary spatially besides the sediment transport rate also the flow velocity is uniform the flow is described using the one dimensional conservation equations for water mass and streamwise momentum i e the saint venant equations saint venant 1871 under equilibrium conditions the conservation equation for water mass is simplified to q i x 0 where qi denotes the water discharge in branch i see fig 1 which implies 2 q i b i u i h i const where hi denotes the flow depth fig 2 as the flow velocity is uniform over the branch eq 2 implies that also the flow depth does not vary over the branch under equilibrium conditions the conservation equation for streamwise momentum of the flow reduces to the backwater equation for a uniform flow depth the backwater equation reduces to the normal flow equation 3 h i q i 2 i i c 2 b i 2 1 3 where ii denotes the channel slope for simplicity the chézy friction coefficient c is assumed independent of the bed surface texture and flow conditions and hence constant under mixed size sediment conditions the exner equation is replaced by the equations for the conservation of gravel and sand mass at the bed surface i e the hirano equations hirano 1971 parker 1991 ribberink 1987 under equilibrium conditions the hirano equations reduce to s i g x s i s x 0 where the subscripts g and s indicate gravel and sand respectively and sig and sis denote respectively the gravel and sand transport capacities in branch i this implies that in an equilibrium state without particle abrasion the gravel and sand load do not vary within a branch e g blom et al 2016 for simplicity we apply the engelund and hansen power law load relation in a fractional manner blom et al 2017a 2016 and replace eq 1 by 4 s i s i g s i s 5 s i g f i g b i m g u i n 6 s i s 1 f i g b i m s u i n where fig denotes the volumetric fraction content of gravel at the bed surface in branch i or briefly the surface gravel content fig 2 and m g g d g and m s g d s with dg and ds the grain sizes of respectively gravel and sand obviously the coefficients mg and ms have different values similarly to the unisize case we assume mg not to vary between the branches the same holds for ms combination of eqs 5 and 6 with the stationary hirano and saint venant equations shows analogous to the unisize sediment case that under equilibrium conditions without uplift subsidence and particle abrasion the flow velocity flow depth and surface gravel content do not vary within a branch the model requires a nodal point relation that relates the ratio of the sediment supply to the downstream branches to the ratio of the water discharge the nodal point relation introduced by wang et al 1995 is applicable to unisize sediment conditions 7 s α q k or s 1 s 2 α q 1 q 2 k where s i denotes the rate of sediment supply per unit width to branch i the superscript indicates the ratio of the values of the specific variable for branches 1 and 2 e g s s 1 s 2 α is the nodal point prefactor and qi is the water discharge per unit width in branch i eq 7 can also be written as 8 s α q k b 1 k or s 1 s 2 α q 1 q 2 k b 1 b 2 1 k for conditions dominated by two grain size modes gravel and sand we introduce two nodal point relations one describing the partitioning of the gravel load over the bifurcates and one the sand load 9 s g α g q k g b 1 k g or s 1 g s 2 g α g q 1 q 2 k g b 1 b 2 1 k g 10 s s α s q k s b 1 k s or s 1 s s 2 s α s q 1 q 2 k s b 1 b 2 1 k s where kg and ks denote the nodal point coefficients and αg and αs are the nodal point prefactors both for gravel and sand respectively we realize that the above form of the nodal point relations is too simple to cover the physics of the problem of river bifurcations adequately in addition to the strongly simplified form of the nodal point relations for gravel and sand the values for the nodal point coefficients kg ks αg and αs likely are not constants and models for these coefficients are needed to properly analyze the physics of the bifurcation problem yet despite these strong simplifications we believe that the current analysis provides useful insight on elementary bifurcation behavior we will address this aspect in further detail in the discussion section the fact that both downstream branches are governed by the same base level fig 1 and also the upstream water surface elevation of the two branches is equal creates the following geometrical constraint in an equilibrium state wang et al 1995 11 i 1 l or i 1 i 2 l 2 l 1 where li is the length of branch i fig 1 we now have a set of equations that can be solved to determine the equilibrium states of the two downstream branches 3 the equilibrium state we manipulate the set of equations listed in section 2 to find the equilibrium solutions of the bifurcation cases shown in fig 1 under equilibrium conditions the sediment supply rate must be equal to the sediment transport capacity and we therefore set s i g s i g and s i s s i s in addition we substitute eqs 2 6 and 11 into 9 and 10 this yields an implicit solution to the ratio of the water discharge in the two downstream branches q 12 q l b 1 3 n m g s s 0 m s s g 0 m g s s 0 α s q k s b 1 k s 1 1 m s s g 0 α g q k g b 1 k g 1 1

discharge in branch 0 q 0 the gravel and sand supply rates to branch 0 s 0g and s 0s and the variables mg ms l b ks and kg are known we compute the flow depth hi using eq 3 as well as the surface gravel content fig using eq 5 or 6 eq 12 has at least three solutions two solutions that are associated with the closure of one of the branches q 0 q and one solution in which both downstream branches remain open generically the flow depth differs between the downstream branches but under conditions in which l 1 the flow depth in the downstream branches is equal even if the width varies between the branches we define a base case that except for the bifurcate length is loosely based on the bifurcation of the bovenrijn into the pannerdensch kanaal and the waal branch the bifurcation is located in the netherlands and about 10 km downstream from where the rhine river crosses the german dutch border the water discharge is set equal to the one characterized by a one year recurrence period 4000 m3 s we simply assume the bifurcates to have the same channel length here l 1 l 2 10 km this yields the following parameter values for the base case α g α s 1 b 0 315 m b 1 b 2 250 m c 1 c 2 50 m1 2 s s 0 g 0 001 m3 s s 0 s 0 007 m3 s and q 0 4000 m3 s for a detailed analysis of eq 12 we refer to appendix a 1 it illustrates that we can distinguish between three sections in the kg ks parameter space i ii and iii each with a different number of solutions to eq 12 and hence of the flow depth in the downstream branches fig 3 i and iii there are three equilibrium solutions two solutions correspond with one of the downstream branches closed the other solution corresponds with both branches open ii a and ii b there are five equilibrium solutions two solutions correspond with one of the downstream branches closed the remaining three solutions correspond with both branches open the differences between sections i and iii and between ii a and ii b will be addressed in the next section the boundaries of the sections i ii a ii b and iii in fig 3 depend on the ratio of the sand load to the gravel load in the upstream branch branch 0 which is denoted by s 0 the ratio of the length of the bifurcates l and the ratio of the channel width of the bifurcates b fig 4 an increase of the sand load in the upstream channel at the expense of its gravel load leads to a decrease of section ii b and an increase of section ii a an increase of the difference in channel length between the two bifurcates significantly decreases section ii and an increase of section i section ii tends to become negligible for values of l even mildly larger than 1 the effects of s 0 and l are significant whereas the effect of a difference in channel width between the two bifurcates b appears to be limited the current analysis is limited to engineered rivers where the channel width cannot adjust to changes in the controls i e statistics of the water discharge sediment supply and base level the analysis illustrates that a mixed size sediment two channel system consists of three to five solutions to the morphodynamic equilibrium state this differs from a unisize sediment two channel system for which three equilibrium solutions exist wang et al 1995 the existence of three to five solutions also contrasts with the single solution to the morphodynamic equilibrium state of a one channel system under unisize as well as mixed size sediment conditions blom et al 2017a 2016 howard 1980 natural rivers where besides the channel slope and bed surface texture also the channel width responds to changes in the controls allow for more equilibrium states than engineered rivers with a fixed channel width blom et al 2017a in natural rivers there exists a range of equilibrium states for which the channel is able to transport the load supplied from above blom et al 2017a in the current analysis we have not considered the effect of erodable banks yet one may expect that just as in the single channel case the presence of erodable banks allows for a range of equilibrium states 4 model of the stability of the equilibrium state we set up a system of differential equations for the flow depth and the surface gravel content in the bifurcates to study the temporal changes in the bifurcation system for simplicity we assume that perturbations in bed elevation i e aggradational and degradational waves which arise from a difference between the sediment supply to a downstream branch and its sediment transport capacity move so fast along the downstream branches that we can assume a branch averaged response of bed elevation this implies that we consider branch averaged values for bed elevation ηi flow depth hi and surface texture represented by the surface gravel content fig fig 2 another consequence of this branch averaged approach is the fact that the channel slope in each bifurcate cannot adjust with time as the aggradation or degradation rate does not vary within a bifurcate the constant channel slope and base level imply that although the bed elevation changes with time the water surface elevation in the bifurcates remains constant with time such a reach averaged approach is valid provided that the perturbation in bed elevation migrates relatively fast down in the channel or if the channel is relatively short i e a small value of li the exner equation describing conservation of bed sediment is 13 c b b i η i t s i x where t denotes time cb the sediment concentration within the bed c b 1 p with p denoting bed porosity and η is bed elevation with respect to a fixed reference level as h η w η fig 2 and the water surface elevation ηw is constant due to our branch averaged approach we find that η i t h i t this implies that eq 13 can be written as wang et al 1995 14 c b b i h i t s i x as we assume that gradients in the sediment transport rate result in a branch averaged degradation or aggradation rate we write si x as 15 s i x s i s i l i combination of eqs 14 and 15 then yields 16 d h i d t 1 c b b i l i s i s i we apply a simplified form of the hirano active layer model hirano 1971 to describe the temporal change of the surface gravel content in the topmost part of the bed that interacts with the flow i e in the active layer to arrive at a simplified version of the hirano equation we apply a similar branch averaged approach to the migration of perturbations in the bed surface texture as to perturbations in bed elevation worded differently we assume surface texture perturbations which arise from a difference between the grain size distribution of the sediment supply to a downstream branch and the grain size distribution of the transported sediment to move so fast along a bifurcate that we can consider a branch averaged response of the bed surface gravel content in the bifurcate fig the reach averaged approach is valid provided that the perturbation in the bed surface texture migrates downstream fast along the channel e g a small depth of reworking or a small active layer thickness or if the channel is relatively short i e a small value of li in addition we assume that the vertical sediment flux between the active layer and the substrate that is associated with a change in elevation of the interface between the active layer and the substrate has the same grain size distribution as the one of the active layer sediment even under conditions of degradation under these simplifying assumptions the hirano active layer equation reduces to 17 d f i g d t 1 c b b i l i 1 l a f i g s i s i s i g s i g where la denotes the thickness of the active layer or the surface layer that is reworked by the flow the adjustment of the bed surface texture is characterized by an exponential growth of which the time scale i e the e folding time or the time interval in which the exponentially growing quantity increases by a factor of e equals 18 t c b b i l i l a we have derived the following system of differential equations for the flow depth hi and surface gravel content fig by manipulating eqs 16 17 using eqs 9 10 for simplicity setting α g α s 1 and introducing time t where t t c b 19 d h 1 d t q 0 n b 1 l 1 g 1 h 1 h 2 f 1 g g 1 h 1 h 2 20 d h 2 d t q 0 n b 2 l 2 g 2 h 1 h 2 f 2 g g 2 h 1 h 2 21 d f 1 g d t q 0 n b 1 l 1 1 l a f 1 g g 1 h 1 h 2 f 1 g g 1 h 1 h 2 g 1 g h 1 h 2 g 1 g h 1 h 2 f 1 g 22 d f 2 g d t q 0 n b 2 l 2 1 l a f 2 g g 2 h 1 h 2 f 2 g g 2 h 1 h 2 g 2 g h 1 h 2 g 2 g h 1 h 2 f 2 g where the functions gi g i gig and g i g i 1 2 are defined in appendix b we abbreviate eqs 19 22 by h i f i g ψ h i f i g where the dot indicates the derivative with respect to time naturally the equilibrium solutions of section 3 are solutions of ψ h i f i g 0 5 stability of the equilibrium state equilibrium solutions only emerge if they are stable the stability properties of the solutions of ψ h i f i g 0 are determined by the eigenvalues of the jacobian j of ψ which is defined as 23 j ψ 1 h 1 ψ 1 h 2 ψ 1 f 1 g ψ 1 f 2 g ψ 2 h 1 ψ 2 h 2 ψ 2 f 1 g ψ 2 f 2 g ψ 3 h 1 ψ 3 h 2 ψ 3 f 1 g ψ 3 f 2 g ψ 4 h 1 ψ 4 h 2 ψ 4 f 1 g ψ 4 f 2 g if all eigenvalues at an equilibrium solution have negative positive real parts the equilibrium solutions are linearly and nonlinearly stable unstable and are nodal points in the 4 dimensional phase space if there are positive and negative eigenvalues the solution is unstable and a saddle point in the phase space e g wiggins 1990 purely imaginary eigenvalues would give rise to periodic solutions in the phase space yet this does not occur for this particular set of equations as the system of eqs 19 22 and the associated jacobian j in eq 23 are too complex to be analyzed analytically we analyze the system numerically for the details of the analysis we refer to appendix a 2 in summary the following holds for the sections i iii in fig 3 i the two equilibrium solutions that correspond with one branch closed are stable the other solution where both branches are open is unstable the initial conditions determine to which stable state the system evolves ii a and ii b the two equilibrium solutions that correspond with one branch closed are stable the other three solutions correspond with both branches open the two new solutions compared to section i are created in a blue sky bifurcation appendix a 2 only one of them is stable the initial conditions determine to which of the three stable equilibrium states the system evolves iii the two equilibrium solutions that correspond with one branch closed are unstable the solution with both branches open is the only stable solution this implies that for every initial condition both branches remain open for a two channel system under unisize sediment conditions there exists one critical value of the nodal point coefficient k k n 3 below which the equilibrium solution with one closed bifurcation is stable wang et al 1995 for values of k larger than n 3 the equilibrium solution with two open bifurcates is stable a case in which k n 3 is similar to the current section i and the latter case is similar to the current section iii under unisize sediment conditions section ii does not exist for a single channel system with fixed banks the single solution to the equilibrium state is stable blom et al 2017a 2016 howard 1980 6 evolution towards the stable equilibrium state we numerically simulate the system of eqs 19 22 to assess 1 the effects of the initial flow depth h 1 and h 2 and the initial surface gravel content f 1g and f 2g in the bifurcating branches 2 the mechanism that results in closure of one of the branches and 3 the effects of the nodal point coefficients in combination with the sediment supply we analyze these three aspects below 6 1 effect of the initial conditions in the bifurcating branches in section ii the initial conditions determine to which of the three stable equilibrium states the system evolves fig 5 shows the results of two numerical runs of the system of eqs 19 22 in which we assess the effects of the initial flow depth in the bifurcating branches h 1 and h 2 the only difference between the two runs are the initial values of the flow depth h 1 and h 2 for equal length of the bifurcates l 1 and arbitrary value of the ratio of the bifurcate width b the flow depth and surface gravel content in the two bifurcates evolve toward the same value h 1 and f g 1 it appears that a difference in the initial flow depth results in different behavior in one case both branches stay open while in the other case one branch closes in the case where both branches remain open the surface gravel content in the two branches f 1g and f 2g evolves towards the same value the surface gravel content f 1g in the closing branch evolves to 0 which means that eventually the bed surface in this closing branch consists of sand only fig 6 shows the results of two runs where only the initial surface gravel content in the bifurcating channels f 1g and f 2g varies between the runs again we observe the effect of the initial conditions they determine whether the situation evolves towards a state with either both branches open or one branch closed 6 2 mechanism of closure of one of the branches we consider the case where one of the branches closes in fig 5 solid lines to study the mechanism of branch closure to this end we analyze the difference between the load and supply of gravel and sand for respectively branches 1 and 2 fig 7 a and b as the sediment supply in branch 2 exceeds the sediment transport capacity s 2 s 2 0 aggradation will occur and branch 2 slowly closes the sediment supply in branch 1 approaches the sediment transport capacity s 1 s 1 0 which implies that the flow depth in branch 1 approaches an equilibrium nonzero value in branch 2 the sand supply exceeds the sand transport capacity s 2 s s 2 s 0 and the gravel supply is smaller than the gravel transport capacity s 2 g s 2 g 0 which implies that the bed surface of the branch becomes increasingly sandy this is reflected by the fact that bed surface gravel content approaches zero f 2g 0 solid line in fig 5b the bed surface of branch 1 continues to consist of a mixture of gravel and sand i e f 1g approaches an equilibrium nonzero value this is understandable as in the final state the gravel and sand supply from the upstream branch is transported by branch 1 which requires both gravel and sand to be represented at the bed surface see eqs 5 and 6 6 3 effects of nodal point coefficients and sediment supply finally we study the dependence of bifurcation dynamics on the nodal point coefficients kg and ks and the gravel and sand supply to the upstream branch 0 we consider two situations k g 5 k s 1 section ii a fig 8 and k g 1 k s 5 section ii b fig 9 we study two cases with respect to the ratio s 0 s 0 s s 0 g either s 0 2 i e a relatively coarse supply upper plots or s 0 7 i e a relatively fine supply lower plots if kg ks fig 8 a case governed by a relatively coarse sediment supply to the upstream branch tends towards a system with two stable open branches and this change happens relatively fast a case with a much larger sand content in the sediment supply tends to develop towards a system with one closed channel if the initial surface gravel content in branch 1 is in the range 0 1 0 4 fig 8c d yet if ks kg fig 9 a case with a relatively coarse upstream supply tends towards a system with one closed channel provided that the initial gravel content in branch 1 is in the range 0 2 0 9 fig 9a b for a relatively fine sediment supply to the upstream branch the situation with two open branches is always stable fig 9c d finally we stress the long time scale associated with the temporal change of the bifurcation system in our numerical runs this seems to be due to our assumption of branch averaged change in the two bifurcates which slows down bifurcation adjustment this is because in the branch averaged model the result of a mismatch between the sediment supply to a bifurcate and its sediment transport capacity is distributed over the entire branch rather than the effect initially being limited to the upstream end of the bifurcate in reality such a mismatch leads to an aggradational or degradational wave that starts at the upstream end of the bifurcate and then migrates downstream this feeds back to the mismatch more strongly than in our branch averaged approach and therefore in reality the expected change likely occurs much faster than in our idealized model nevertheless there is evidence from field data that bifurcation change can be slow a change to a new dominant channel may require significant time slingerland and smith 2004 and often require several centuries in the rhine meuse delta and durations of up to 1250 years have been estimated by stouthamer and berendsen 2001 7 discussion 7 1 the load relation in our analysis we have applied the engelund and hansen load relation in a fractional manner blom et al 2017a 2016 this fractional form of the load relation has never been properly validated and this approach likely is more valid in lowland rivers where partial mobility is less relevant the analysis can be repeated for more complicated load relations e g those including a threshold for significant transport or hiding effects we do not expect however that application of a more complicated and realistic load relation affects our analysis of the equilibrium states and the associated conclusions as another load relation does not change the analysis in a fundamental manner the analysis would still yield four coupled differential equations similar to eqs 19 22 in which the coefficients are different from the ones based on the original load relation this also holds for the jacobian in eq 23 the results would differ somewhat from the ones based on the original load relation but we do not expect new phenomena 7 2 the nodal point relation a crucial point in the presented analysis is the fact that we assume that there exists a nodal point relation of the form of eq 8 for the unisize sediment case or eqs 9 and 10 for the mixed size sediment case this form of the nodal point relation is too simple to describe the partitioning of sediment at river bifurcations e g van der mark and mosselman 2013 wang et al 1995 already suggested a nodal point relation of a more extensive form s f b q c h it is however difficult to constrain the various parameters in the nodal point relation although an attempt may lead to a more realistic relation even in the simple form of the nodal point relation used here the values of its coefficients kg ks αg and αs are not likely constant and models describing their temporal behavior are needed to properly analyze river bifurcation problems the simplicity of our nodal point relation however does enable us to assess a range of reasonable values for k in the unisize sediment case let us consider the general nodal point relation in eq 8 and assume that the bed material load is primarily transported as bed load if we consider a bifurcation point with a flat bed just upstream of the bifurcation point the sediment supply to the downstream branches is likely distributed over the downstream branches according to their values of the channel width and so it may be argued that s b and so k 0 and α 1 bolla pittaluga et al 2003 at the other side of the spectrum we consider a case where sediment is primarily transported as wash load and well distributed over the water column in such a case the sediment supply to the downstream branches is likely partitioned over the downstream branches according to the ratio of the water discharge s q which implies that k α 1 de heer and mosselman 2004 dutta et al 2017 thus we expect that the finer the sediment supply to branch 0 the larger is the value of k within the range of 0 to 1 in reality however conditions are more complex due to the presence of a lateral bed slope a bend bars or structures we discuss the latter effects below first for the unisize sediment case and subsequently for the mixed size sediment case typically the difference in bed elevation between the two bifurcates induces a lateral slope just upstream of the bifurcation this slope effect increases the sediment supply to the deeper bifurcate and therefore acts as a stabilizing mechanism as it counteracts further deepening of the deeper bifurcate this effect needs to be accounted for when setting up a model for the nodal point coefficient bends and bars affect the flow just upstream of the bifurcation and as such may affect the sediment partitioning over the downstream branches of the bifurcation for instance the sediment partitioning at a bifurcation that is located just downstream of a pointbar in an inner bend is affected by the associated secondary flow and the transverse gradient in bed elevation just upstream of the bifurcation the presence of a sill in the downstream branch 1 likely reduces the sediment supply to that branch fig 10 a considering the nodal point relation in eq 7 and assuming that the sill s effect on the sediment supply is larger than on the water discharge k must be larger than 1 and for a relatively high sill with barely sediment supply to the specific channel k should approach a similar line of reasoning holds under mixed size sediment conditions recall that the nodal point relations eqs 9 and 10 read s g α g q k g and s s α s q k s the above lateral slope effect induced by the inlet step varies with grain size coarse sediment is affected more strongly than fine sediment parker and andrews 1985 and the same holds for the lateral slope effect introduced by bends and bars this also applies to the presence of a sill in one of the bifurcates coarse sediment is affected more strongly than fine sediment as the transport of coarse sediment concentrates more strongly near the bed an additional effect of a river bend is bend sorting a pointbar typically consists of relatively fine sediment whereas the bed surface and transported load in the outer bend are coarser fig 10b hence the sediment supply to the bifurcate located in the outer bend is coarser than the supply to the other bifurcate these effects will need to be accounted for in relations for the nodal point coefficients αg αs kg and ks the associated consequences for river bifurcation dynamics will need to be studied 7 3 the stability criterion based on their mathematical stability analysis for the case of unisize sediment conditions wang et al 1995 found that the stability criterion for two open branches is given by k n 3 this can also be found through reasoning kleinhans et al 2008 which is summarized here to subsequently extend this reasoning to the case of mixed size sediment eq 8 illustrates that the sediment supply to branch i s i is proportional to q i k and eqs 1 3 show that the sediment transport capacity of a branch is proportional to q i n 3 now suppose that k n 3 in that case the sediment supply per unit width to branch i increases more strongly with increasing water discharge per unit width in branch i than the sediment transport capacity which leads to aggradation as a result the water discharge per unit width qi decreases which means that the situation stabilizes on the other hand if k n 3 the sediment supply to branch i increases less strongly with increasing qi than the sediment transport capacity this implies that the channel degrades which increases qi even further so the situation further destabilizes at the expense of the other downstream branch which closes for the case of mixed size sediment we reason in a similar manner the supply of gravel and sand to branch i s i g and s i s are proportional to q i k g and q i k s respectively the transport capacities of gravel and sand in branch i sig and sis now also depend on the surface gravel content in branch i fig and are proportional to f i g m g q i n 3 and 1 f i g m s q i n 3 respectively we now suppose that the water discharge per unit width in branch i qi increases this implies that the gravel and sand supply to branch i increase the manner of which depend on the values of kg and ks as kg and ks are expected to have different values the gravel and sand supply to branch i respond differently to the increase in the water discharge also the gravel and sand transport capacities sig and sis respond differently to the increase in the water discharge due to the mobility difference between coarse and fine sediment i e grain size selective transport depending on the resulting change of the gravel and sand supply to branch i s i g and s i s and the change in the gravel and sand transport capacities sig and sis the increase in water discharge qi affects the surface gravel content in branch i fig which is expressed by a coarsening or fining of the bed surface thus based on physical reasoning it is much less straightforward to draw conclusions concerning the expected temporal change and a stability criterion of a river bifurcation dominated by mixed size sediment as a next step we recommend the formulation of submodels for the nodal point coefficients kg and ks which among other parameters likely depend on the transverse bed slope just upstream of the bifurcation bolla pittaluga et al 2003 and hence likely are a function of the ratio of the flow depth in the bifurcates h where h h 1 h 2 in such a case the formulation of the jacobian in eq 23 becomes more complicated because of the derivatives with respect to h 1 and h 2 analysis of the jacobian and the numerical results would provide insight on the expected temporal change and the stability criterion of a river bifurcation dominated by mixed size sediment 7 4 symmetrical bifurcations it has been found that symmetrical bifurcations i e bifurcates with equal properties such as water discharge channel width and flow depth tend to be unstable more often than asymmetrical bifurcations i e one of the bifurcates is significantly smaller than the other one bertoldi and tubino 2007 bolla pittaluga et al 2015 edmonds and slingerland 2008 kleinhans et al 2013 2008 miori et al 2006 in our base case which is characterized by equal channel width friction and length of the bifurcates we find that in sections ii and iii symmetrical solutions are stable which may contradict the above findings our results are similar to those of wang et al 1995 who find that a symmetrical solution is stable for k n 3 this similarity between the results may not be surprising as our model is an extension of the highly idealized model of wang et al 1995 to mixed size sediment conditions whereas other models account for the effects of a transverse bed slope bolla pittaluga et al 2015 2003 edmonds and slingerland 2008 kleinhans et al 2013 2008 alternate bars bertoldi et al 2009 redolfi et al 2016 curvature induced flow asymmetry upstream of the bifurcation kleinhans et al 2008 van denderen et al 2017 suspended bed material load slingerland and smith 1998 cohesive sediment edmonds and slingerland 2008 hajek and edmonds 2014 bend sorting sloff et al 2003 sloff and mosselman 2012 and bank erosion miori et al 2006 van denderen et al 2017 these effects are not taken into account in our analysis but may be represented by appropriate future models for kg and ks 8 conclusions we extend a highly idealized model of the dynamics of a river bifurcation to mixed size sediment conditions the model is based on nodal point relations for gravel and sand that set the partitioning of gravel and sand over the downstream branches or bifurcates the model describes the equilibrium solutions and based on a branch averaged approximation of aggradation and degradation describes the temporal change of bed elevation and bed surface texture in the bifurcates of a mixed size sediment river bifurcation the introduction of mixed size sediment mechanisms to the river bifurcation problem introduces an additional degree of freedom the temporal adjustment of the bed surface texture in each of the bifurcates the dynamics of the downstream branches concerning their flow depth and bed surface texture and the resulting stable configuration of the downstream branches result from differences between a the gravel and sand supply in each branch and b its gravel and sand transport capacity we set up a mathematical model of the equilibrium states and dynamics of a mixed size sediment river bifurcation in our analysis we have neglected the effects of a transverse bed slope alternate bars curvature induced flow asymmetry upstream of the bifurcation suspended bed material load cohesive sediment bend sorting and bank erosion the proposed model therefore has limited predictive value regarding real river bifurcations yet provides insight on the elementary effects of mixed size sediment mechanisms on the river bifurcation problem subsequent analyses may combine the analysis of mixed size sediment mechanisms with the above mentioned effects howard 1980 and blom et al 2017a 2016 have shown that there exists one solution to the morphodynamic equilibrium state in a one channel system with nonerodible banks in a unisize sediment two channel system with fixed banks three equilibrium solutions exist whereas three to five solutions exist in a mixed size sediment bifurcation system in the mixed size sediment two channel system we distinguish three sections i ii and iii in the parameter space related to the nodal point coefficients the specific layout of the three sections depends on the ratio of the bifurcate length and the ratio of the upstream gravel supply to the sand supply in section i the only stable solutions are the ones with one branch closed and in section iii the only stable solution is the one with both branches open in section ii there are three stable solutions two with one branch closed and one with two open branches to which of these three stable equilibrium solutions the system evolves depends on the initial conditions i e the initial flow depth and bed surface texture in the bifurcates appendix a details of the equilibrium solutions and their stability a1 equilibrium solutions in this appendix we analyze eq 12 and explain fig 3 in more detail the three solutions for q of eq 12 give rise to three solutions for the combination of flow depths in the downstream branches hi two with one branch closed one with both branches open we now consider a fixed value of ks and increase the value of kg i e we make a horizontal transect in fig 3 for relatively small values of ks and kg three equilibrium solutions exist fig 11 a for such small values of ks there exists a threshold value for kg k g k g a for which there is a q such that q φ q 0 and d q φ q d q q q 0 this implies that for kg kga two new solutions of q φ q 0 emerge and we then find five equilibrium solutions fig 11b two with one branch closed and three with both branches open the threshold value kga depends on ks and defines the boundary between sections i and ii a b in fig 3 for larger values of ks we find another threshold value for kg which we call kgb at that value the new solutions of q φ q 0 that emerge at kga annilihate with q 0 and q which correspond with one branch closed so for larger values of ks and for kg kgb there are again only 3 solutions fig 11c two solutions correspond with the situation with a closed branch and the other solutions with a situation with both branches open a2 stability properties this appendix explores the ks kg parameter space and the stability properties of the equilibrium solutions in the sections i ii a ii b and iii we use the same approach as in appendix a we fix ks at a certain value and vary kg i e we again make a horizontal transect through fig 3 for each combination of ks and kg we determine where q φ q 0 compute the associated flow depth in the two bifurcates hi and compute the other variables e g sis sig fs fg etc and the eigenvalues of the jacobian j in eq 23 fig 12 a shows the result for q for k s 1 and 0 kg 4 for three values of l for simplicity we do not indicate the stable solutions q 0 and q for each value of l one mathematical bifurcation occurs at a specific value of kg blue sky bifurcation corresponding with the occurrence of the solid lines in fig 12a for l 1 33 the bifurcation into a stable solution occurs for kg 4 in fig 12a and is therefore not visible the values of kg for which the bifurcations occur correspond with the transitions from section i to ii a in fig 3 fig 12b shows a similar plot for k s 2 5 now we observe two bifurcations one where the stable solution for q emerges in a blue sky bifurcation occurrence of the solid lines in fig 12b and one where the unstable solutions of q are annihilated in a collision with the stable solutions q 0 and q saddle node bifurcation vanishing of the dashes lines at q 0 leaving only one single stable solution in section iii we summarize the consequences of these results in section 5 appendix b functions in the system of equations this appendix provides the functions for g 1 g 1g g 2 g 2g g

743,we derive an idealized model of a gravel sand river bifurcation and analyze its stability properties the model requires nodal point relations that describe the ratio of the supply of gravel and sand to the two downstream branches the model predicts changes in bed elevation and bed surface gravel content in the two bifurcates under conditions of a constant water discharge sediment supply base level and channel width and under the assumption of a branch averaged approach of the bifurcates the stability analysis reveals more complex behavior than for unisize sediment three to five equilibrium solutions exist rather than three in addition we find that under specific parameter settings the initial conditions in the bifurcates determine to which of the equilibrium states the system evolves our approach has limited predictive value for real bifurcations due to neglecting several effects e g transverse bed slope alternate bars upstream flow asymmetry and bend sorting yet it provides a first step in addressing mixed size sediment mechanisms in modeling the dynamics of river bifurcations keywords river bifurcation mixed size sediment idealized model equilibrium stability analysis 1 introduction river bifurcations or diffluences are found in alluvial fans braided rivers anabranching rivers deltas cut off channels diversions for flood control or water intakes and in constructed side channels that are part of river restoration schemes once a bifurcation is initiated a downstream channel or bifurcate or distributary continues to deepen as long as the sediment transport capacity exceeds the sediment supply to the channel sediment transport in a channel consists of bed material load i e bed load and suspended bed material load and wash load church 2006 paola 2001 as wash load is typically assumed to be distributed uniformly over the water column it is assumed to be partitioned over the bifurcates according to the ratio of the water discharge bed material load however partitions over the bifurcates in a less straightforward manner the partitioning of sediment in streams dominated by suspended bed material load depends on the initial flow depth and channel slope in the bifurcates slingerland and smith 1998 the grain size of the bed sediment slingerland and smith 1998 and curvature induced effects in the upstream channel hackney et al 2017 the partitioning of sediment in bed load dominated streams depends on the conditions in the bifurcates base level channel width friction bifurcation angle bulle 1926 van der mark and mosselman 2013 tarekul islam et al 2006 and the zones of flow recirculation close to the bifurcation bulle 1926 de heer and mosselman 2004 marra et al 2014 thomas et al 2011 vegetation burge 2006 and cohesive sediment and bank erosion miori et al 2006 zolezzi et al 2006 the conditions in the area just upstream of the bifurcation the transverse distribution of water and sediment over the upstream channel which is affected by secondary flow van der mark and mosselman 2013 a transverse bed slope induced by an inlet step bolla pittaluga et al 2003 alternate bars bertoldi and tubino 2007 bertoldi et al 2009 redolfi et al 2016 and sediment mobility frings and kleinhans 2008 conditions extending further upstream flow asymmetry induced by a bend which tends to provide one bifurcate with a larger fraction content of the flow and the other one with a larger fraction content of the sediment load federici and paola 2003 hardy et al 2011 kleinhans et al 2008 van dijk et al 2014 and transverse sediment sorting due to bend flow frings and kleinhans 2008 sloff et al 2003 sloff and mosselman 2012 the partitioning of the sediment load over the bifurcates determines whether the bifurcation develops towards a stable state with two open downstream branches or a state in which the water discharge in one of the branches continues to increase at the expense of the other branch the latter case may lead to the silting up of one of the downstream channels under such conditions a one channel configuration is a stable equilibrium solution of the bifurcation system wang et al 1995 yet in literature this situation is often termed an unstable bifurcation burge 2006 federici and paola 2003 as the two channel system ceases to exist early one dimensional reduced complexity models describing the development towards the equilibrium states of two bifurcates have been developed for bed load transport in sand bed rivers wang et al 1995 bed load transport in gravel bed rivers bolla pittaluga et al 2003 and suspended bed material load slingerland and smith 1998 such reduced complexity models allow for the computation of the partitioning of the water discharge as the water surface elevation at the bifurcation point must be equal between the three reaches the sediment partitioning however depends on the geometry of the bifurcation and the three dimensional flow structure which obviously cannot be reproduced by a one dimensional model a one dimensional model therefore requires a nodal point relation that describes the partitioning of the sediment load over the bifurcates wang et al 1995 were the first to introduce a nodal point relation describing the partitioning of the sediment supplied from upstream over the bifurcates they then apply a simpler form of their nodal point relation s 1 s 2 q 1 q 2 k where s 1 2 is the rate of sediment supply per unit width to branches 1 and 2 and q 1 2 is the water supply per unit width to branches 1 and 2 to analyse the stability of the solutions to the equilibrium morphodynamic state of the bifurcates studying avulsion development slingerland and smith 1998 introduce a nodal point relation that originates from integration of the vertical concentration profile of the suspended sediment alternative nodal point relations have been developed by bolla pittaluga et al 2003 who account for the effects of a transverse bed slope that induces lateral sediment transport to the deeper bifurcate and kleinhans et al 2008 who account for the effects of an upstream bend both of which will be addressed in further detail below pioneering work on bifurcation dynamics using a nodal point relation was conducted by wang et al 1995 they assume a constant water discharge and sediment supply rate in the upstream channel a constant and equal base level in the two bifurcating branches and unisize sediment conditions they apply the engelund and hansen 1967 sediment transport relation without a threshold for significant transport s un where s denotes the sediment transport capacity per unit width u the depth averaged flow velocity and n is the exponent in the power law load relation n 5 they find that for k n 3 the equilibrium solution where one of the bifurcates closes is stable whereas for k n 3 the equilibrium solution with two open branches is stable despite these early results a model for k is still lacking also slingerland and smith 1998 reveal that a bifurcation or avulsion develops towards a stable state with two open downstream branches or a state in which one channel becomes the dominant channel at the expense of the other branch in such strongly idealized one dimensional analyses two dimensional and three dimensional effects near the bifurcation point are not readily accounted for one of these effects is the bulle effect bulle 1926 dutta et al 2017 van der mark and mosselman 2013 which indicates a situation where the sediment supply to a diversion channel i e a channel that branches off the main channel under a certain angle is significantly larger than the diversion channel s fraction content of the water discharge this effect is associated with secondary flow e g thomas et al 2011 another effect is the difference in bed elevation that is associated with a difference in flow depth between the two bifurcates e g bolla pittaluga et al 2003 kleinhans et al 2013 this bed elevation difference also denoted using the term inlet step tends to increase the sediment supply to the deeper bifurcate e g slingerland and smith 1998 which acts as a stabilizing mechanism although mixed size sediment systems may reveal behavior that is essentially different from unisize sediment systems blom et al 2017a 2017b 2016 mosselman and sloff 2008 sinha and parker 1996 so far the influence of noncohesive mixed size sediment on bifurcation dynamics has not been studied explicitly wash load suspended bed material load and bed load church 2006 paola 2001 are expected to respond differently to the above mentioned mechanisms hackney et al 2017 mixed size sediment effects are the following 1 as the vertical profile of sediment concentration is less uniform over depth for coarse sediment i e coarse sediment tends to concentrate more strongly near the bed coarse sediment tends to be affected more by an inlet step than fine sediment slingerland and smith 1998 2 the effect of the transverse bed slope on lateral transport upstream of the bifurcation depends on grain size where coarse sediment is affected by the transverse bed slope more strongly than fines parker and andrews 1985 3 the presence of a bend upstream of the bifurcation typically leads to bend sorting and a coarser sediment supply to the distributary in the outer bend than to the one in the inner bend frings and kleinhans 2008 sloff et al 2003 sloff and mosselman 2012 4 alternate bar formation and geometry appear to be affected by the grain size distribution of the sediment mixture bertoldi and tubino 2005 lanzoni 2000 our objective is to assess the elementary consequences of the introduction of mixed size sediment mechanisms in the modelling of the dynamics of a river bifurcation to this end we follow wang et al 1995 s approach and its simple nodal point relation with associated limitations and simplifications we neglect the effects of vegetation cohesive sediment bank erosion alternate bars or a bend in the upstream channel as well as the bulle effect and the transverse slope effect we extend their model to conditions with bed material load of a two fraction sediment mixture consisting of gravel and sand this implies the need for two nodal point relations describing the ratio of respectively the gravel and sand supply to the two bifurcates we study the stability of the equilibrium states of the bifurcates in an engineered river characterized by a fixed channel width the proposed analysis and model are applicable to both cases shown in fig 1 a bifurcation system with two bifurcates that are characterized by the same base level and a side channel system we set up a model describing the equilibrium solutions of the mixed sediment bifurcation system section 2 we determine its equilibrium solutions section 3 we derive a system of ordinary differential equations for the flow depth and bed surface texture in the bifurcates section 4 and perform a stability analysis of the equilibrium solutions section 5 the analysis also provides insight on the time scale of the evolution towards the stable equilibrium solutions section 6 2 model of the equilibrium state in this section we strongly simplify the situation of a gravel sand river bifurcation describe the problem from a mathematical point of view and list the governing equations to this end we consider an engineered river with a fixed channel width that may vary between the branches a temporally constant water discharge in the upstream branch i e branch 0 in fig 1 and a temporally constant gravel supply rate and constant sand supply rate to the upstream branch under equilibrium conditions t 0 without subsidence uplift and particle abrasion the equation describing conservation of sediment mass i e the exner equation reduces to the stationary exner equation s i x 0 where si denotes the sediment transport capacity in branch i the subscript i indicates branch i and x is the streamwise coordinate in other words by definition the sediment transport capacity si equals the sediment supply to branch i s i where the bar indicates the sediment supply for simplicity we apply the engelund and hansen power law load relation engelund and hansen 1967 1 s i b i m i u i n in which m i g i d with d denoting a characteristic grain size g i 0 05 c i 3 r 2 g 1 2 ui the depth averaged flow velocity bi the channel width ci the chézy friction coefficient g denotes the gravitational acceleration and r the submerged density r ρ s ρ ρ where ρs and ρ are the mass density of respectively sediment and water for simplicity we assume that mi does not vary between the branches m i m which implies that also the friction coefficient and the coefficient g do not vary between the branches c i c g i g combination of eq 1 with the stationary exner equation illustrates that under equilibrium conditions where the channel width and friction do not vary spatially besides the sediment transport rate also the flow velocity is uniform the flow is described using the one dimensional conservation equations for water mass and streamwise momentum i e the saint venant equations saint venant 1871 under equilibrium conditions the conservation equation for water mass is simplified to q i x 0 where qi denotes the water discharge in branch i see fig 1 which implies 2 q i b i u i h i const where hi denotes the flow depth fig 2 as the flow velocity is uniform over the branch eq 2 implies that also the flow depth does not vary over the branch under equilibrium conditions the conservation equation for streamwise momentum of the flow reduces to the backwater equation for a uniform flow depth the backwater equation reduces to the normal flow equation 3 h i q i 2 i i c 2 b i 2 1 3 where ii denotes the channel slope for simplicity the chézy friction coefficient c is assumed independent of the bed surface texture and flow conditions and hence constant under mixed size sediment conditions the exner equation is replaced by the equations for the conservation of gravel and sand mass at the bed surface i e the hirano equations hirano 1971 parker 1991 ribberink 1987 under equilibrium conditions the hirano equations reduce to s i g x s i s x 0 where the subscripts g and s indicate gravel and sand respectively and sig and sis denote respectively the gravel and sand transport capacities in branch i this implies that in an equilibrium state without particle abrasion the gravel and sand load do not vary within a branch e g blom et al 2016 for simplicity we apply the engelund and hansen power law load relation in a fractional manner blom et al 2017a 2016 and replace eq 1 by 4 s i s i g s i s 5 s i g f i g b i m g u i n 6 s i s 1 f i g b i m s u i n where fig denotes the volumetric fraction content of gravel at the bed surface in branch i or briefly the surface gravel content fig 2 and m g g d g and m s g d s with dg and ds the grain sizes of respectively gravel and sand obviously the coefficients mg and ms have different values similarly to the unisize case we assume mg not to vary between the branches the same holds for ms combination of eqs 5 and 6 with the stationary hirano and saint venant equations shows analogous to the unisize sediment case that under equilibrium conditions without uplift subsidence and particle abrasion the flow velocity flow depth and surface gravel content do not vary within a branch the model requires a nodal point relation that relates the ratio of the sediment supply to the downstream branches to the ratio of the water discharge the nodal point relation introduced by wang et al 1995 is applicable to unisize sediment conditions 7 s α q k or s 1 s 2 α q 1 q 2 k where s i denotes the rate of sediment supply per unit width to branch i the superscript indicates the ratio of the values of the specific variable for branches 1 and 2 e g s s 1 s 2 α is the nodal point prefactor and qi is the water discharge per unit width in branch i eq 7 can also be written as 8 s α q k b 1 k or s 1 s 2 α q 1 q 2 k b 1 b 2 1 k for conditions dominated by two grain size modes gravel and sand we introduce two nodal point relations one describing the partitioning of the gravel load over the bifurcates and one the sand load 9 s g α g q k g b 1 k g or s 1 g s 2 g α g q 1 q 2 k g b 1 b 2 1 k g 10 s s α s q k s b 1 k s or s 1 s s 2 s α s q 1 q 2 k s b 1 b 2 1 k s where kg and ks denote the nodal point coefficients and αg and αs are the nodal point prefactors both for gravel and sand respectively we realize that the above form of the nodal point relations is too simple to cover the physics of the problem of river bifurcations adequately in addition to the strongly simplified form of the nodal point relations for gravel and sand the values for the nodal point coefficients kg ks αg and αs likely are not constants and models for these coefficients are needed to properly analyze the physics of the bifurcation problem yet despite these strong simplifications we believe that the current analysis provides useful insight on elementary bifurcation behavior we will address this aspect in further detail in the discussion section the fact that both downstream branches are governed by the same base level fig 1 and also the upstream water surface elevation of the two branches is equal creates the following geometrical constraint in an equilibrium state wang et al 1995 11 i 1 l or i 1 i 2 l 2 l 1 where li is the length of branch i fig 1 we now have a set of equations that can be solved to determine the equilibrium states of the two downstream branches 3 the equilibrium state we manipulate the set of equations listed in section 2 to find the equilibrium solutions of the bifurcation cases shown in fig 1 under equilibrium conditions the sediment supply rate must be equal to the sediment transport capacity and we therefore set s i g s i g and s i s s i s in addition we substitute eqs 2 6 and 11 into 9 and 10 this yields an implicit solution to the ratio of the water discharge in the two downstream branches q 12 q l b 1 3 n m g s s 0 m s s g 0 m g s s 0 α s q k s b 1 k s 1 1 m s s g 0 α g q k g b 1 k g 1 1

gravel content fig using eq 5 or 6 eq 12 has at least three solutions two solutions that are associated with the closure of one of the branches q 0 q and one solution in which both downstream branches remain open generically the flow depth differs between the downstream branches but under conditions in which l 1 the flow depth in the downstream branches is equal even if the width varies between the branches we define a base case that except for the bifurcate length is loosely based on the bifurcation of the bovenrijn into the pannerdensch kanaal and the waal branch the bifurcation is located in the netherlands and about 10 km downstream from where the rhine river crosses the german dutch border the water discharge is set equal to the one characterized by a one year recurrence period 4000 m3 s we simply assume the bifurcates to have the same channel length here l 1 l 2 10 km this yields the following parameter values for the base case α g α s 1 b 0 315 m b 1 b 2 250 m c 1 c 2 50 m1 2 s s

ii and iii each with a different number of solutions to eq 12 and hence of the flow depth in the downstream branches fig 3 i and iii there are three equilibrium solutions two solutions correspond with one of the downstream branches closed the other solution corresponds with both branches open ii a and ii b there are five equilibrium solutions two solutions correspond with one of the downstream branches closed the remaining three solutions correspond with both branches open the differences between sections i and iii and between ii a and ii b will be addressed in the next section the boundaries of the sections i ii a ii b and iii in fig 3 depend on the ratio of the sand load to the gravel load in the upstream branch branch 0 which is denoted by s 0 the ratio of the length of the bifurcates l and the ratio of the channel width of the bifurcates b fig 4 an increase of the sand load in the upstream channel at the expense of its gravel load leads to a decrease of section ii b and an increase of section ii a an increase of the difference in channel length between the two bifurcates significantly decreases section ii and an increase of section i section ii tends to become negligible for values of l even mildly larger than 1 the effects of s 0 and l are significant whereas the effect of a difference in channel width between the two bifurcates b appears to be limited the current analysis is limited to engineered rivers where the channel width cannot adjust to changes in the controls i e statistics of the water discharge sediment supply and base level the analysis illustrates that a mixed size sediment two channel system consists of three to five solutions to the morphodynamic equilibrium state this differs from a unisize sediment two channel system for which three equilibrium solutions exist wang et al 1995 the existence of three to five solutions also contrasts with the single solution to the morphodynamic equilibrium state of a one channel system under unisize as well as mixed size sediment conditions blom et al 2017a 2016 howard 1980 natural rivers where besides the channel slope and bed surface texture also the channel width responds to changes in the controls allow for more equilibrium states than engineered rivers with a fixed channel width blom et al 2017a in natural rivers there exists a range of equilibrium states for which the channel is able to transport the load supplied from above blom et al 2017a in the current analysis we have not considered the effect of erodable banks yet one may expect that just as in the single channel case the presence of erodable banks allows for a range of equilibrium states 4 model of the stability of the equilibrium state we set up a system of differential equations for the flow depth and the surface gravel content in the bifurcates to study the temporal changes in the bifurcation system for simplicity we assume that perturbations in bed elevation i e aggradational and degradational waves which arise from a difference between the sediment supply to a downstream branch and its sediment transport capacity move so fast along the downstream branches that we can assume a branch averaged response of bed elevation this implies that we consider branch averaged values for bed elevation ηi flow depth hi and surface texture represented by the surface gravel content fig fig 2 another consequence of this branch averaged approach is the fact that the channel slope in each bifurcate cannot adjust with time as the aggradation or degradation rate does not vary within a bifurcate the constant channel slope and base level imply that although the bed elevation changes with time the water surface elevation in the bifurcates remains constant with time such a reach averaged approach is valid provided that the perturbation in bed elevation migrates relatively fast down in the channel or if the channel is relatively short i e a small value of li the exner equation describing conservation of bed sediment is 13 c b b i η i t s i x where t denotes time cb the sediment concentration within the bed c b 1 p with p denoting bed porosity and η is bed elevation with respect to a fixed reference level as h η w η fig 2 and the water surface elevation ηw is constant due to our branch averaged approach we find that η i t h i t this implies that eq 13 can be written as wang et al 1995 14 c b b i h i t s i x as we assume that gradients in the sediment transport rate result in a branch averaged degradation or aggradation rate we write si x as 15 s i x s i s i l i combination of eqs 14 and 15 then yields 16 d h i d t 1 c b b i l i s i s i we apply a simplified form of the hirano active layer model hirano 1971 to describe the temporal change of the surface gravel content in the topmost part of the bed that interacts with the flow i e in the active layer to arrive at a simplified version of the hirano equation we apply a similar branch averaged approach to the migration of perturbations in the bed surface texture as to perturbations in bed elevation worded differently we assume surface texture perturbations which arise from a difference between the grain size distribution of the sediment supply to a downstream branch and the grain size distribution of the transported sediment to move so fast along a bifurcate that we can consider a branch averaged response of the bed surface gravel content in the bifurcate fig the reach averaged approach is valid provided that the perturbation in the bed surface texture migrates downstream fast along the channel e g a small depth of reworking or a small active layer thickness or if the channel is relatively short i e a small value of li in addition we assume that the vertical sediment flux between the active layer and the substrate that is associated with a change in elevation of the interface between the active layer and the substrate has the same grain size distribution as the one of the active layer sediment even under conditions of degradation under these simplifying assumptions the hirano active layer equation reduces to 17 d f i g d t 1 c b b i l i 1 l a f i g s i s i s i g s i g where la denotes the thickness of the active layer or the surface layer that is reworked by the flow the adjustment of the bed surface texture is characterized by an exponential growth of which the time scale i e the e folding time or the time interval in which the exponentially growing quantity increases by a factor of e equals 18 t c b b i l i l a we have derived the following system of differential equations for the flow depth hi and surface gravel content fig by manipulating eqs 16 17 using eqs 9 10 for simplicity setting α g α s 1 and introducing time t where t t c b 19 d h 1 d t q 0 n b 1 l 1 g 1 h 1 h 2 f

2 l 2 1 l a f 2 g g 2 h 1 h 2 f 2 g g 2 h 1 h 2 g 2 g h 1 h 2 g 2 g h 1 h 2 f 2 g where the functions gi g i gig and g i g i 1 2 are defined in appendix b we abbreviate eqs 19 22 by h i f i g ψ h i f i g where the dot indicates the derivative with respect to time naturally the equilibrium solutions of section 3 are solutions of ψ h i f i g 0 5 stability of the equilibrium state equilibrium solutions only emerge if they are stable the stability properties of the solutions of ψ h i f i g 0 are determined by the eigenvalues of the jacobian j of ψ which is defined as 23 j ψ 1 h 1 ψ 1 h 2 ψ

parts the equilibrium solutions are linearly and nonlinearly stable unstable and are nodal points in the 4 dimensional phase space if there are positive and negative eigenvalues the solution is unstable and a saddle point in the phase space e g wiggins 1990 purely imaginary eigenvalues would give rise to periodic solutions in the phase space yet this does not occur for this particular set of equations as the system of eqs 19 22 and the associated jacobian j in eq 23 are too complex to be analyzed analytically we analyze the system numerically for the details of the analysis we refer to appendix a 2 in summary the following holds for the sections i iii in fig 3 i the two equilibrium solutions that correspond with one branch closed are stable the other solution where both branches are open is unstable the initial conditions determine to which stable state the system evolves ii a and ii b the two equilibrium solutions that correspond with one branch closed are stable the other three solutions correspond with both branches open the two new solutions compared to section i are created in a blue sky bifurcation appendix a 2 only one of them is stable the initial conditions determine to which of the three stable equilibrium states the system evolves iii the two equilibrium solutions that correspond with one branch closed are unstable the solution with both branches open is the only stable solution this implies that for every initial condition both branches remain open for a two channel system under unisize sediment conditions there exists one critical value of the nodal point coefficient k k n 3 below which the equilibrium solution with one closed bifurcation is stable wang et al 1995 for values of k larger than n 3 the equilibrium solution with two open bifurcates is stable a case in which k n 3 is similar to the current section i and the latter case is similar to the current section iii under unisize sediment conditions section ii does not exist for a single channel system with fixed banks the single solution to the equilibrium state is stable blom et al 2017a 2016 howard 1980 6 evolution towards the stable equilibrium state we numerically simulate the system of eqs 19 22 to assess 1 the effects of the initial flow depth h 1 and h 2 and the initial surface gravel content f 1g and f 2g in the bifurcating branches 2 the mechanism that results in closure of one of the branches and 3 the effects of the nodal point coefficients in combination with the sediment supply we analyze these three aspects below 6 1 effect of the initial conditions in the bifurcating branches in section ii the initial conditions determine to which of the three stable equilibrium states the system evolves fig 5 shows the results of two numerical runs of the system of eqs 19 22 in which we assess the effects of the initial flow depth in the bifurcating branches h 1 and h 2 the only difference between the two runs are the initial values of the flow depth h 1 and h 2 for equal length of the bifurcates l 1 and arbitrary value of the ratio of the bifurcate width b the flow depth and surface gravel content in the two bifurcates evolve toward the same value h 1 and f g 1 it appears that a difference in the initial flow depth results in different behavior in one case both branches stay open while in the other case one branch closes in the case where both branches remain open the surface gravel content in the two branches f 1g and f 2g evolves towards the same value the surface gravel content f 1g in the closing branch evolves to 0 which means that eventually the bed surface in this closing branch consists of sand only fig 6 shows the results of two runs where only the initial surface gravel content in the bifurcating channels f 1g and f 2g varies between the runs again we observe the effect of the initial conditions they determine whether the situation evolves towards a state with either both branches open or one branch closed 6 2 mechanism of closure of one of the branches we consider the case where one of the branches closes in fig 5 solid lines to study the mechanism of branch closure to this end we analyze the difference between the load and supply of gravel and sand for respectively branches 1 and 2 fig 7 a and b as the sediment supply in branch 2 exceeds the sediment transport capacity s 2 s 2 0 aggradation will occur and branch 2 slowly closes the sediment supply in branch 1 approaches the sediment transport capacity s 1 s 1 0 which implies that the flow depth in branch 1 approaches an equilibrium nonzero value in branch 2 the sand supply exceeds the sand transport capacity s 2 s s 2 s 0 and the gravel supply is smaller than the gravel transport capacity s 2 g s 2 g 0 which implies that the bed surface of the branch becomes increasingly sandy this is reflected by the fact that bed surface gravel content approaches zero f 2g 0 solid line in fig 5b the bed surface of branch 1 continues to consist of a mixture of gravel and sand i e f 1g approaches an equilibrium nonzero value this is understandable as in the final state the gravel and sand supply from the upstream branch is transported by branch 1 which requires both gravel and sand to be represented at the bed surface see eqs 5 and 6 6 3 effects of nodal point coefficients and sediment supply finally we study the dependence of bifurcation dynamics on the nodal point coefficients kg and ks and the gravel and sand supply to the upstream branch 0 we consider two situations k g 5 k s 1 section ii a fig 8 and k g 1 k s 5 section ii b fig 9 we study two cases with respect to the ratio s 0 s 0 s s 0 g either s 0 2 i e a relatively coarse supply upper plots or s 0 7 i e a relatively fine supply lower plots if kg ks fig 8 a case governed by a relatively coarse sediment supply to the upstream branch tends towards a system with two stable open branches and this change happens relatively fast a case with a much larger sand content in the sediment supply tends to develop towards a system with one closed channel if the initial surface gravel content in branch 1 is in the range 0 1 0 4 fig 8c d yet if ks kg fig 9 a case with a relatively coarse upstream supply tends towards a system with one closed channel provided that the initial gravel content in branch 1 is in the range 0 2 0 9 fig 9a b for a relatively fine sediment supply to the upstream branch the situation with two open branches is always stable fig 9c d finally we stress the long time scale associated with the temporal change of the bifurcation system in our numerical runs this seems to be due to our assumption of branch averaged change in the two bifurcates which slows down bifurcation adjustment this is because in the branch averaged model the result of a mismatch between the sediment supply to a bifurcate and its sediment transport capacity is distributed over the entire branch rather than the effect initially being limited to the upstream end of the bifurcate in reality such a mismatch leads to an aggradational or degradational wave that starts at the upstream end of the bifurcate and then migrates downstream this feeds back to the mismatch more strongly than in our branch averaged approach and therefore in reality the expected change likely occurs much faster than in our idealized model nevertheless there is evidence from field data that bifurcation change can be slow a change to a new dominant channel may require significant time slingerland and smith 2004 and often require several centuries in the rhine meuse delta and durations of up to 1250 years have been estimated by stouthamer and berendsen 2001 7 discussion 7 1 the load relation in our analysis we have applied the engelund and hansen load relation in a fractional manner blom et al 2017a 2016 this fractional form of the load relation has never been properly validated and this approach likely is more valid in lowland rivers where partial mobility is less relevant the analysis can be repeated for more complicated load relations e g those including a threshold for significant transport or hiding effects we do not expect however that application of a more complicated and realistic load relation affects our analysis of the equilibrium states and the associated conclusions as another load relation does not change the analysis in a fundamental manner the analysis would still yield four coupled differential equations similar to eqs 19 22 in which the coefficients are different from the ones based on the original load relation this also holds for the jacobian in eq 23 the results would differ somewhat from the ones based on the original load relation but we do not expect new phenomena 7 2 the nodal point relation a crucial point in the presented analysis is the fact that we assume that there exists a nodal point relation of the form of eq 8 for the unisize sediment case or eqs 9 and 10 for the mixed size sediment case this form of the nodal point relation is too simple to describe the partitioning of sediment at river bifurcations e g van der mark and mosselman 2013 wang et al 1995 already suggested a nodal point relation of a more extensive form s f b q c h it is however difficult to constrain the various parameters in the nodal point relation although an attempt may lead to a more realistic relation even in the simple form of the nodal point relation used here the values of its coefficients kg ks αg and αs are not likely constant and models describing their temporal behavior are needed to properly analyze river bifurcation problems the simplicity of our nodal point relation however does enable us to assess a range of reasonable values for k in the unisize sediment case let us consider the general nodal point relation in eq 8 and assume that the bed material load is primarily transported as bed load if we consider a bifurcation point with a flat bed just upstream of the bifurcation point the sediment supply to the downstream branches is likely distributed over the downstream branches according to their values of the channel width and so it may be argued that s b and so k 0 and α 1 bolla pittaluga et al 2003 at the other side of the spectrum we consider a case where sediment is primarily transported as wash load and well distributed over the water column in such a case the sediment supply to the downstream branches is likely partitioned over the downstream branches according to the ratio of the water discharge s q which implies that k α 1 de heer and mosselman 2004 dutta et al 2017 thus we expect that the finer the sediment supply to branch 0 the larger is the value of k within the range of 0 to 1 in reality however conditions are more complex due to the presence of a lateral bed slope a bend bars or structures we discuss the latter effects below first for the unisize sediment case and subsequently for the mixed size sediment case typically the difference in bed elevation between the two bifurcates induces a lateral slope just upstream of the bifurcation this slope effect increases the sediment supply to the deeper bifurcate and therefore acts as a stabilizing mechanism as it counteracts further deepening of the deeper bifurcate this effect needs to be accounted for when setting up a model for the nodal point coefficient bends and bars affect the flow just upstream of the bifurcation and as such may affect the sediment partitioning over the downstream branches of the bifurcation for instance the sediment partitioning at a bifurcation that is located just downstream of a pointbar in an inner bend is affected by the associated secondary flow and the transverse gradient in bed elevation just upstream of the bifurcation the presence of a sill in the downstream branch 1 likely reduces the sediment supply to that branch fig 10 a considering the nodal point relation in eq 7 and assuming that the sill s effect on the sediment supply is larger than on the water discharge k must be larger than 1 and for a relatively high sill with barely sediment supply to the specific channel k should approach a similar line of reasoning holds under mixed size sediment conditions recall that the nodal point relations eqs 9 and 10 read s g α g q k g and s s α s q k s the above lateral slope effect induced by the inlet step varies with grain size coarse sediment is affected more strongly than fine sediment parker and andrews 1985 and the same holds for the lateral slope effect introduced by bends and bars this also applies to the presence of a sill in one of the bifurcates coarse sediment is affected more strongly than fine sediment as the transport of coarse sediment concentrates more strongly near the bed an additional effect of a river bend is bend sorting a pointbar typically consists of relatively fine sediment whereas the bed surface and transported load in the outer bend are coarser fig 10b hence the sediment supply to the bifurcate located in the outer bend is coarser than the supply to the other bifurcate these effects will need to be accounted for in relations for the nodal point coefficients αg αs kg and ks the associated consequences for river bifurcation dynamics will need to be studied 7 3 the stability criterion based on their mathematical stability analysis for the case of unisize sediment conditions wang et al 1995 found that the stability criterion for two open branches is given by k n 3 this can also be found through reasoning kleinhans et al 2008 which is summarized here to subsequently extend this reasoning to the case of mixed size sediment eq 8 illustrates that the sediment supply to branch i s i is proportional to q i k and eqs 1 3 show that the sediment transport capacity of a branch is proportional to q i n 3 now suppose that k n 3 in that case the sediment supply per unit width to branch i increases more strongly with increasing water discharge per unit width in branch i than the sediment transport capacity which leads to aggradation as a result the water discharge per unit width qi decreases which means that the situation stabilizes on the other hand if k n 3 the sediment supply to branch i increases less strongly with increasing qi than the sediment transport capacity this implies that the channel degrades which increases qi even further so the situation further destabilizes at the expense of the other downstream branch which closes for the case of mixed size sediment we reason in a similar manner the supply of gravel and sand to branch i s i g and s i s are proportional to q i k g and q i k s respectively the transport capacities of gravel and sand in branch i sig and sis now also depend on the surface gravel content in branch i fig and are proportional to f i g m g q i n 3 and 1 f i g m s q i n 3 respectively we now suppose that the water discharge per unit width in branch i qi increases this implies that the gravel and sand supply to branch i increase the manner of which depend on the values of kg and ks as kg and ks are expected to have different values the gravel and sand supply to branch i respond differently to the increase in the water discharge also the gravel and sand transport capacities sig and sis respond differently to the increase in the water discharge due to the mobility difference between coarse and fine sediment i e grain size selective transport depending on the resulting change of the gravel and sand supply to branch i s i g and s i s and the change in the gravel and sand transport capacities sig and sis the increase in water discharge qi affects the surface gravel content in branch i fig which is expressed by a coarsening or fining of the bed surface thus based on physical reasoning it is much less straightforward to draw conclusions concerning the expected temporal change and a stability criterion of a river bifurcation dominated by mixed size sediment as a next step we recommend the formulation of submodels for the nodal point coefficients kg and ks which among other parameters likely depend on the transverse bed slope just upstream of the bifurcation bolla pittaluga et al 2003 and hence likely are a function of the ratio of the flow depth in the bifurcates h where h h 1 h 2 in such a case the formulation of the jacobian in eq 23 becomes more complicated because of the derivatives with respect to h 1 and h 2 analysis of the jacobian and the numerical results would provide insight on the expected temporal change and the stability criterion of a river bifurcation dominated by mixed size sediment 7 4 symmetrical bifurcations it has been found that symmetrical bifurcations i e bifurcates with equal properties such as water discharge channel width and flow depth tend to be unstable more often than asymmetrical bifurcations i e one of the bifurcates is significantly smaller than the other one bertoldi and tubino 2007 bolla pittaluga et al 2015 edmonds and slingerland 2008 kleinhans et al 2013 2008 miori et al 2006 in our base case which is characterized by equal channel width friction and length of the bifurcates we find that in sections ii and iii symmetrical solutions are stable which may contradict the above findings our results are similar to those of wang et al 1995 who find that a symmetrical solution is stable for k n 3 this similarity between the results may not be surprising as our model is an extension of the highly idealized model of wang et al 1995 to mixed size sediment conditions whereas other models account for the effects of a transverse bed slope bolla pittaluga et al 2015 2003 edmonds and slingerland 2008 kleinhans et al 2013 2008 alternate bars bertoldi et al 2009 redolfi et al 2016 curvature induced flow asymmetry upstream of the bifurcation kleinhans et al 2008 van denderen et al 2017 suspended bed material load slingerland and smith 1998 cohesive sediment edmonds and slingerland 2008 hajek and edmonds 2014 bend sorting sloff et al 2003 sloff and mosselman 2012 and bank erosion miori et al 2006 van denderen et al 2017 these effects are not taken into account in our analysis but may be represented by appropriate future models for kg and ks 8 conclusions we extend a highly idealized model of the dynamics of a river bifurcation to mixed size sediment conditions the model is based on nodal point relations for gravel and sand that set the partitioning of gravel and sand over the downstream branches or bifurcates the model describes the equilibrium solutions and based on a branch averaged approximation of aggradation and degradation describes the temporal change of bed elevation and bed surface texture in the bifurcates of a mixed size sediment river bifurcation the introduction of mixed size sediment mechanisms to the river bifurcation problem introduces an additional degree of freedom the temporal adjustment of the bed surface texture in each of the bifurcates the dynamics of the downstream branches concerning their flow depth and bed surface texture and the resulting stable configuration of the downstream branches result from differences between a the gravel and sand supply in each branch and b its gravel and sand transport capacity we set up a mathematical model of the equilibrium states and dynamics of a mixed size sediment river bifurcation in our analysis we have neglected the effects of a transverse bed slope alternate bars curvature induced flow asymmetry upstream of the bifurcation suspended bed material load cohesive sediment bend sorting and bank erosion the proposed model therefore has limited predictive value regarding real river bifurcations yet provides insight on the elementary effects of mixed size sediment mechanisms on the river bifurcation problem subsequent analyses may combine the analysis of mixed size sediment mechanisms with the above mentioned effects howard 1980 and blom et al 2017a 2016 have shown that there exists one solution to the morphodynamic equilibrium state in a one channel system with nonerodible banks in a unisize sediment two channel system with fixed banks three equilibrium solutions exist whereas three to five solutions exist in a mixed size sediment bifurcation system in the mixed size sediment two channel system we distinguish three sections i ii and iii in the parameter space related to the nodal point coefficients the specific layout of the three sections depends on the ratio of the bifurcate length and the ratio of the upstream gravel supply to the sand supply in section i the only stable solutions are the ones with one branch closed and in section iii the only stable solution is the one with both branches open in section ii there are three stable solutions two with one branch closed and one with two open branches to which of these three stable equilibrium solutions the system evolves depends on the initial conditions i e the initial flow depth and bed surface texture in the bifurcates appendix a details of the equilibrium solutions and their stability a1 equilibrium solutions in this appendix we analyze eq 12 and explain fig 3 in more detail the three solutions for q of eq 12 give rise to three solutions for the combination of flow depths in the downstream branches hi two with one branch closed one with both branches open we now consider a fixed value of ks and increase the value of kg i e we make a horizontal transect in fig 3 for relatively small values of ks and kg three equilibrium solutions exist fig 11 a for such small values of ks there exists a threshold value for kg k g k g a for which there is a q such that q φ q 0 and d q φ q d q q q 0 this implies that for kg kga two new solutions of q φ q 0 emerge and we then find five equilibrium solutions fig 11b two with one branch closed and three with both branches open the threshold value kga depends on ks and defines the boundary between sections i and ii a b in fig 3 for larger values of ks we find another threshold value for kg which we call kgb at that value the new solutions of q φ q 0 that emerge at kga annilihate with q 0 and q which correspond with one branch closed so for larger values of ks and for kg kgb there are again only 3 solutions fig 11c two solutions correspond with the situation with a closed branch and the other solutions with a situation with both branches open a2 stability properties this appendix explores the ks kg parameter space and the stability properties of the equilibrium solutions in the sections i ii a ii b and iii we use the same approach as in appendix a we fix ks at a certain value and vary kg i e we again make a horizontal transect through fig 3 for each combination of ks and kg we determine where q φ q 0 compute the associated flow depth in the two bifurcates hi and compute the other variables e g sis sig fs fg etc and the eigenvalues of the jacobian j in eq 23 fig 12 a shows the result for q for k s 1 and 0 kg 4 for three values of l for simplicity we do not indicate the stable solutions q 0 and q for each value of l one mathematical bifurcation occurs at a specific value of kg blue sky bifurcation corresponding with the occurrence of the solid lines in fig 12a for l 1 33 the bifurcation into a stable solution occurs for kg 4 in fig 12a and is therefore not visible the values of kg for which the bifurcations occur correspond with the transitions from section i to ii a in fig 3 fig 12b shows a similar plot for k s 2 5 now we observe two bifurcations one where the stable solution for q emerges in a blue sky bifurcation occurrence of the solid lines in fig 12b and one where the unstable solutions of q are annihilated in a collision with the stable solutions q 0 and q saddle node bifurcation vanishing of the dashes lines at q 0 leaving only one single stable solution in section iii we summarize the consequences of these results in section 5 appendix b functions in the system of equations this appendix provides the functions for g 1 g 1g g 2 g 2g g

744,this paper assesses the sustainability of bioenergy production under a nexus perspective through a new efficiency type index the index describes 1st generation biofuel production under the perspective of the implied consumption of natural resources we consider the sustainability of energy production as a sequence of steps each characterised by its efficiency and propose an index which returns an overall efficiency value describing the adequacy or inadequacy of the considered processes under a nexus perspective the direct application of the nexus index entails an indication of the possible improvements needed to move production towards most sustainable processes or places moreover it allows evaluating the efficiency of the main crops currently used in biofuel production with respect to the water food energy nexus the results depict countries presently capable of performing sustainable production of 1st generation biofuel from particular crops furthermore the analysis of

dornburg et al 2010 at the same time they can increase the quote of self produced energy for many countries amineh and crijns graus 2014 thöne et al 2009 favero and pettenella 2014 nevertheless the use of edible crops as feedstock for energy conversion is in direct competition with food production harvey and pilgrim 2011 affecting water and land management this is due to the higher request of crops caused by the simultaneous demand for food and feedstock for energy production gude 2015 moreover the crop yield is often increased by massive irrigation giving a higher food production but accompanied by a low efficiency in the use of water resources the design of energy production systems carried out taking into account all these aspects is a challenging duty a specific design method is far from being completely defined howells 2013 the current energy food and freshwater supply systems are optimised to give the maximum possible output in terms of the commodity or and source they are designed to produce or deliver cosgrove and louck 2015 hejazi et al 2015 this leads to the creation of systems which are efficient in their own scope but which are far away from the absolute optimal point in terms of sustainable use of water and energy resources under a food energy water hereafter few nexus perspective many authors have analysed the single subcomponents of water food energy nexus and many indicators exist to analyse the effect of 1st generation biofuel as a definition 1st generation biofuels are liquid fuels produced directly from crops otherwise used for food production this distinguishes these products from the fuels obtained from conversion of waste 2nd generation or non food crops production in terms of water use and depletion competition with food and land consumption for example indicators of water and land use for biofuel production already assess the impact of bioenergy production of any single natural resource they are dealing with rulli et al 2016 however just few attempts of analysing the interlinks between food energy and water in biofuel production have been done d odorico et al 2018 and at our knowledge no indicator does exist to take in bioenergy production under few nexus perspective historically two different works set the basis to define and analyse the concept of water food energy nexus in the limits to growth meadows et al 1972 important insights in the problem were given but these hints did not form a single tool suitable for policy makers this study placed the first milestone for the sustainability assessment but it did not address the wef nexus as a whole few years later the method welmm grenon and lapillonne 1976 was developed directly focusing on five connected resources water energy land materials and manpower this methodology provided the first example of dataset used for sustainability assessment but it did not involve an integrated analysis useful under a wef perspective nowadays the way is still open for the development of integrated assessment models tol 2006 this study proposes a new methodology for the few description considering all the aspects of this concept and summarising them in a single simple indicator most of the existing models consider the single relationships energy land and energy water use however most of the available tools do not address the problem as a whole the commonly used methods for energy system analysis include message messner and strubegger 1995 markal zonooz et al 2009 leap heaps 2012 models on the other side the weap stockholm environment institute 2011 model is often used for water system planning these models while providing useful information in their application field lack the data and methodological components required to conduct an integrated policy assessment bazilian 2011 a tool which should be simple enough to be useful for policy makers but precise enough to well describe the current energy production under a nexus perspective is still missing here we propose a new index which resumes in one single output the effect of 1st generation biofuel energy production on sustainability under a few nexus perspective the index is aimed to analyse the interrelationship among water food and energy in 1st generation biofuel production at the global scale and to assess the sustainability of biofuel production from a specific crop in a single country for this purpose the various components of the few nexus are studied in detail for biofuel production from any specific crop and in order to define an efficiency type index the use of the resources water food and land is compared to a reference value i e the least impacting use of the specific resource this new index does not substitute the existing tools used for the analysis of the single aspects of the few nexus but it integrates and complements them giving a preliminary assessment of the complex interrelations between the components of the few nexus 2 methodological framework the design of an index assessing the few nexus should follow the deep understanding of the punctual indicators characterising the single aspects of the nexus itself for this reason we recall here some literature resources useful to address the single facets of the problem 2 1 water since this paper is focused on biofuel production it is necessary to have tools for analysing the water required to produce a reference quantity of energy from biofuels water is not only used in energy conversion but it is virtually contained in crops used as feedstock because they require large amounts of water to grow finley and seiber 2014 a concept of principal importance in this field is virtual water antonelli and sartori 2015 virtual water is an indicator used to describe the quantity of water required to produce a specific industrial output allan 1993 this indicator is widely used to describe the embedded water in traded goods as shown in the example of virtual water trade antonelli and sartori 2015 however the virtual water concept is designed to assess the water embedded only in physical goods when a commodity is used to produce other goods derived goods in further processes the virtual water concept results not sufficient antonelli and sartori 2015 to extend the concept to derived goods the water footprint indicator was developed water footprint changes the perspective with reference to virtual water the former indicator allows the determination of the quantity of water used in production of goods and services while the latter allows the quantification of the amount of water used during the process of consuming the same goods and services chapagain and hoeksrta et al 2003 water footprint is a fundamental concept since it allows defining in a precise way the amount of water required to produce bioenergy many studies are devoted to this topic grebens leenes et al 2009 velazquez et al 2011 the results of these studies will be used as a starting point in defining our water efficiency index see section 3 but they describe only a single aspect of a complex problem they allow determining the quantity of water needed throughout the production chain of biofuels but they allow neither to understand the renewability of the water used nor to relate it to the resources effectively used during production the sustainability of the water use has been related to a sort of hierarchy in the typology of water sources with some sources more valuable than others also from an economic point of view chapagain and hoekstra 2004 to address this problem the concepts of green and blue water were defined blue water refers to the liquid water above and below the ground rivers lakes and groundwater green water is the soil water in the unsaturated zone derived from precipitations gerbens leenes et al 2009 only green water is usually considered a renewable resource in the strict sense mekonnen and hoekstra 2010 both green and blue water are intensively used in agriculture but blue water is used in direct competition with other human uses e g industries municipalities rulli and d odorico 2013 we do not consider grey water in this analysis because of the scarce accuracy and spatial homogeneity of the available grey water footprint estimators novo et al 2009 falkenmark 1986 mancosu et al 2015 the separation of blue and green water is therefore useful to understand the overall sustainability of the process under a water perspective in particular because analysing the blue water footprint allows one to quantify the impact of biofuel production on renewable resources the share of renewable resources used for biofuel production is therefore used as the main component of our water quality indicator also considering the separation between the blue and green water footprint one is left with a water efficiency indicator which lacks information about the abundance or scarcity of water in the production place water availability is accounted for by considering the world data bank water withdrawal index as a further determinant of the index see section 3 2 2 food the second element to be discussed in a water food energy nexus analysis is the possible interaction of biofuel production with food production including both commodities used for human and animal nutrition we do not aim to consider separately for each crop the amount of food which is subtracted to human consumption by biofuel production because this kind of analysis would involve dietary and nutritional facets which are beyond the scope of the paper in contrast we want to include in our index the simple concept that at the country scale human crop consumption should be favoured with respect to the crop use for energy production when malnutrition affects a non negligible portion of the country s population the reference concept in this field is thus food security food security is defined as a situation that exists when all people at all times have physical social and economic access to sufficient safe and nutritious food that meets their dietary needs and food preferences for an active and healthy life fao 2003 while this definition is rather simple it is difficult to turn this expression into a quantitative index which states the effects of food insecurity worldwide we therefore refer in the definition of our food efficiency index in section 3 to a very simple and well agreed concept to at least roughly characterise food security in a country the prevalence of malnutrition as defined by fao in each country 2 3 land the third element to be investigated in the analysis is land land is the basic resource needed in agriculture and the quantification of land required to produce a defined amount of crop is a point of capital importance models are required to have a good understanding of the efficiency in exploiting this resource for any purpose the key parameter in agriculture is crop yield defined as the quantity of crop produced for ha of land used gebbers and adamchuk 2010 crops yield depends on crop type climate cultivar soil and terrain conditions level of inputs water and fertilizers and management yield data suffer similar problems as data of food security because they are mainly the results of statistical measurements only punctual data are precise but the recovery of such data is hard and they are not always suitable for further studies the use of average or country based data gives less precise indications on land yield but in many cases these are the only data available or usable barret et al 2002 another important feature to be considered in a sustainability assessment of land use is the quantity of land available and suitable for agriculture together with agricultural intensification and increased application of fertilisers and pesticides the expansion in cultivated area is the key factor for the increase in food production observed over the last 50 years khan and hanjra 2008 the total global agricultural area has expanded by 11 to 5 billion ha and the arable land area has expanded from 1 27 to 1 4 billion ha faostat 2014 more land has been converted to cropping in the 30 years after 1960 than in the 150 years between 1700 and 1850 faostat 2014 these data are fundamental to understand the possible further increase in agricultural production and if the use of land is compatible to a sustainable development and changing climate regimes 3 materials and methods in order to assess the effects of biofuel production on global sustainability under a water food energy nexus perspective the current production of biofuels is evaluated by means of a new index which we call the nexus index ni we calculate the nexus index for the most important crops used in biofuel production the list of considered crops is reported in table 1 the index is designed to evaluate the resources required in terms of water food and land to produce one unit of energy fig 1 the formula of the nexus index is 1 n i η w a t e r η f o o d η l a n d which is the mathematical description of a system similar to the one shown in fig 1 where the use of three resources water food and land is necessary to get the final output energy ni is the nexus index η water is the efficiency in water use η food the efficiency with respect to food production and η land is the efficiency in the use of land the first term η water is linked to the water used for crop production stating an efficiency with respect to the lowest quantity of water that is possible to use in a specific process the second term η food is country related and describes the effects of the competition between biofuel and food production the third term η land takes into account the quantity of land required to produce one unit of product again referring to the best attainable performance this method allows comparing different systems providing a result in the range between 0 and 1 in order to get a good score a process must work with the best available technology preventing the resources from being depleted and guarantee the water and food security and a rigorous use of land the three parts have the same weight in the index so that the inefficiency in a single step is directly translated into the result the multiplication of 3 different factors is chosen in order to increase the influence the inefficiency of any single aspect of the index in fact thanks to the theory of limiting effects if only one factor is not efficiently managed the value of the index results strongly penalised this form is preferred to other possible mathematical formulations e g additive form to avoid the need of weighting factors which would include more arbitrary choices in the index definition the number of factors is limited to three to have a compromise between complexity in the data mining phase and precision of the index the three factors determine the influence of biofuel production on the three most important elements that affects the water food energy nexus water use land consumption and food availability giving a simple but precise indicator of efficiency in the following each component of the nexus index is described in detail 3 1 water efficiency the water efficiency index is introduced for assessing the use of water related to biofuel production to this aim this index considers both the amount of water and the source of water used for crop production i e soil moisture due to precipitation that is the so called green water or irrigation water the so called blue water required to produce a pre defined amount of energy via biofuels the water efficiency is here expressed as the product of two terms 2 η w a t e r η w a t e r q u a n t η w a t e r s o u r c e the two terms are equally important and determine the efficiency of water use in biofuel production both for the quantity of water used and for the quality of this water the first part of this index refers to the quantity of water used in the steps required to produce the crop adopted for energetic purposes and to convert it into liquid fuel in order to assess this quantity the water footprint of energy from a selected crop has been calculated following the approach introduced by gerben lenens et al 2009 we then divide the bioenergy water footprint in m3 mj by the lowest global value of the bioenergy water footprint which corresponds to the highest efficiency the reverse of this ratio is an efficiency lying in the desired range of values 0 1 the resulting formula is 3 η w a t e r q u a n t w f m i n w f i where η water quant is the quantitative part of water efficiency wfi is the water footprint of bioenergy from selected crop of the country i wfmin is the minimum water footprint of bioenergy for the selected crop at the global scale the hyperbolic form is chosen after a sensitivity analysis which showed that this form provides the most realistic results other functional forms e g exponential would make the index more complicated with an increased computational complexity not compensated by a higher accuracy this part of the index needs being complemented with some additional information on the water used for this purpose it is important to consider the effect of water footprint according to the availability of freshwater resources in a region moreover there is a great difference if the water used in biofuel production comes from irrigation blue water footprint or from soil water green water footprint to quantify these aspects a specific index is defined the starting point to calculate this effect is the ratio between green water footprint of biofuel production according to gerben lenens et al 2009 and the total water footprint the maximum value equal to 1 is reached if only green water i e only a renewable resource is used to produce biofuel to penalise countries where water is less abundant we consider the following definition 4 η w a t e r s o u r c e w f g r e e n w f t o t w w i where η water source is the source related part of water efficiency wfgreen is the green water footprint of biofuel production wftot is the total water footprint of biofuel production and wwi is the calculated water withdrawals index this exponent is calculated according to data on water withdrawals coming from the world bank data world bank 2014 this index assumes increasing values according to the water withdrawal rate of a specific country the water withdrawal index used here is defined as 5 w w i w a t e r w i t h d r a w a l s 3 2 food efficiency the food efficiency component of the nexus index aims to account for the potential competition for flexible crops crops usable both for nutrition and energy purposes between food and biofuel sectors in food insecure countries the data from faostat describing the prevalence of undernourishment faostat 2014 are used to assess food efficiency this indicator m i assumes values between 0 and 1 and expresses the percentage of population within a country that does not consume a sufficient amount of food this value is then adjusted with an exponent α that aims at penalising the countries more affected by this phenomenon this parameter α is set at 5 a value chosen after a sensitivity analysis showing that larger α values produce more sensible results and for values of α greater then 5 η food is stable the resulting formula is 6 η f o o d 1 m i α where η food is the food efficiency and m i is the prevalence of malnutrition according to faostat 2014 food efficiency as defined here is not crop based but it considers the food security condition of a country because we do not aim to consider the energy food competition for each crop but the overall nutritional picture for each country 3 3 land efficiency the main aim of the land efficiency index is the evaluation of the impact of biofuel production on the availability of cultivable land in a specific country to do so similarly to the case of water efficiency it is necessary to consider both the use of the resource land and its availability the efficiency in using land for growing a certain crop is defined as the crop yield registered in the specific country divided by the maximum value of the crop yield reachable with the current technology i e the maximum yield registered worldwide faostat 2014 these data are provided by fao faostat in order to account for the country available land suitable for agriculture not already used a country specific land used index lu is developed this index is the ratio between the land already used for agriculture the arable land in faostat and the total area suitable for agriculture in a specific country we selected the extent of very suitable suitable or moderately suitable land for mixed input under rain fed and or irrigation conditions for all crops as reported by gaez 2014 finally the land component of the ni is 7 η l a n d y i e l d i y i e l d m a x l u where η land is the land efficiency yieldi is the yield for the considered crop in the country i yieldmax is the maximum possible yield for the specific crop and lu is the land used index similarly to the case of source water efficiency the hyperbolic form is chosen to have a right balance between the two contributions use and availability of the resource 4 results and discussion for applying the proposed methodology the nexus index for various crops used in 1st generation biofuel production was calculated in order to have a homogeneous and complete framework avoiding the problems due to the differences in the used databases the calculation was limited to 191 countries eliminating incongruent data coming from countries with incomplete or unreliable statistical data the number of available countries depends on the distribution of the crop in the world the total number of countries with a calculated nexus index for each crop is shown in table 2 the study is performed with the data referred to year 2014 largely diffused crops like maize rice wheat and soybean have a large quantity of available data because they are cultivated and used as feedstock for biofuels in most part of the considered countries on the other hand for less diffused cultivations like sorghum and oil palm the number of countries in which the nexus index can be calculated is quite low table 2 also reports the localisation of the highest score for each considered crop this depends on the area where the climate is most suitable for cultivation but also on the efficiency of cultivation techniques the maximum values attainable have a great variability fig 2 with crops characterised by high maximum efficiency especially wheat and crops with low maximum efficiency e g sorghum the method is designed to give excellent results when one country is highly efficient in all of the steps composing nexus index this means that crops cultivated with minimum water requirement maximum agricultural yield and without competing with food production will give high scores mismanagement of only one of these steps strongly decreases the overall performance the most produced crops have in general the highest maximal efficiency this is a natural consequence of the intensive research performed in the past to improve agricultural yield for these species fisher et al 2002 on the other hand some crops with low diffusion e g palm oil also score good results this is mainly due to the high specialisation in these cultivations that some countries were able to establish in some cases due to the high profitability of such cash crops the maxima are only representative of the global capability to reach good scores in the nexus index to have a complete understanding of the world performance it is necessary to discuss the results in detail for the selected crop as an example results for maize are discussed in the following section the results for the other crops limited to the cases with more than 50 countries available are reported as maps in the supplementary material the results of the single elements of the proposed index can be compared with the indicators representing the components of the few nexus available in literature to verify the consistency of the results 4 1 nexus index for maize maize is one of the most produced commodities in the world and it is widely used as a feedstock for biofuel production rulli et al 2016 this makes maize an interesting crop to be analysed as mentioned the maximum value for the nexus index for maize is 0 611 and it is reached in belgium the maximum value is not high stating the existence of inefficiencies in bioethanol production the general analysis of the nexus index is displayed in fig 3 as a map and the values for top 10 countries are reported in table 3 the number of countries with scores close to the highest values is not large this means that despite the large diffusion of maize at the global scale inefficiencies are widely present and in many cases the current bioethanol production does not fulfil the requirements of sustainability under a wfe nexus perspective the geographical distribution of scores does not show specific areas where bioethanol production is particularly favourable or penalised in all continents there are countries with nexus index values close to the maximum in general the largest values are found in industrialised countries most of the countries with low scores are in the sub saharan africa other inefficient countries are placed in the area comprised between the middle east and the indian subcontinent the discussion of the single components of the nexus index will disentangle the problems that make some countries not efficient 4 1 1 water efficiency quantitative water efficiency strongly influences the index because it directly states the quantity of water needed to produce bioethanol in a specific country results are shown in fig 4 maize is suitable to be grown in many climates so that its cultivation is diffused in many areas of the world the cultivation techniques have been refined in all the industrialised countries since long time ago for this reason in these places it is not possible to determine areas where the cultivation is particular efficient this relative homogeneity of the results is because the quantity of water required for growing maize is quite similar in almost all the industrialised countries specific country water and soil management does not significantly change the crop water footprint conversely other countries such as most of the sub saharan african and south east asian countries are penalised in this index because of the large quantity of water required to cultivate maize both in term of crop water requirement and as crop water footprint this large need of water can derive both from climate conditions that determine higher crop water requirement and from production inefficiency low yield that results in low production per unit of water used we will distinguish between the two phenomena while discussing the quality based water efficiency the source water green vs blue water efficiency completes the information on sustainable use of water in biofuel production the situation described by the source water efficiency is largely different from the previous part of the index fig 5 we notice that the scale of the results is extremely narrow the lowest value is 0 77 this means that maize is produced in the great majority of countries using mainly green water resources interestingly some of the countries with high level of source water efficiency have at the same time a low score in quantitative water efficiency this is the case of brazil of many sub saharan african countries and of some countries of the asian southeast this is a clear clue of the high crop water requirement of maize in these countries other countries have high quantitative water efficiency and relatively low source water efficiency these countries e g the usa western europe and china produce maize using low quantities of water green blue but with a considerable contribution coming from irrigation 4 1 2 food efficiency the second component of the nexus index is food efficiency this index is by definition independent of the biomass considered the results are displayed in fig 6 most of the world s countries have the maximum score but in africa south america and southeastern asia some countries are not efficient in providing food to their population 4 1 3 land efficiency land use efficiency characterises the last part of water food energy nexus assessing the appropriate use of land in crop production the results for maize are displayed in fig 7 this index is linked to quantitative water efficiency but with some exceptions in fact agricultural yield crop water requirements and irrigation are strictly connected usually large use of irrigation can guarantee high agricultural yield but this is not necessarily the case furthermore agricultural yield is part of the definition of water footprint so that a high yield can decrease the water footprint these complex relationships highlight the need of a punctual analysis of the situation for every single crop in the specific case of maize we can notice that the distribution of scores for land efficiency is sensibly different from the quantitative water efficiency most of the industrialised countries have low values of land efficiency opposite to the high values of water efficiency this is due to the focus in the rationalisation of use of water in cultivation the use of water is adjusted to the optimal point but this does not correspond to the highest level of crop yield furthermore in these countries most of the suitable land is already dedicated to intensive cultivation preventing the possibility of increasing the production a case of particular interest is belgium leading country in nexus index ranking in belgium water and food efficiency have the maximum value while land efficiency results the bottleneck of the biofuel production process in this country land suitable to be cropped does exist but the ratio between the maize crop yield in belgium and the maximum yield in the world is low 0 5 some other nations are characterised by low scores in water efficiency but also by high crop yield this is the case of some small countries e g israel where the little land available for cultivation is exploited in a highly efficient way the analysis of sub saharan countries gives some other interesting hints most of the countries penalised in quantitative water efficiency have high land efficiency scores this is due to the large quantity of land available for cultivation in these countries maize production can be increased without decreasing the nexus index measures to make these countries more efficient should first focus on the reduction of the water footprint the good management of water is in general a key point to generate a sustainable biofuel production system 5 conclusions the sustainability of 1st generation biofuel production at the global scale is assessed through the definition of a new index called the nexus index the output of the method is a score which defines the efficiency of the production of biofuels the index is the product of three intermediate indexes that quantify all the key parameters in biofuel production the nexus index determines if a country is efficiently managing biofuel production from a specific crop defining the lowest attainable consumption of resources in this process the results of the analysis provide the starting point for considerations concerning geographic differences in biofuel production even if we acknowledge the sub country spatial variability of resources availability and demand the country scale of analysis is chosen in order to have homogenous and reliable results because often only at country level all the required information for water food and land is available efficiency in production of biofuels from the same crop can be very different from one country to another this is due to differences in agricultural yield but also to differences in resources deployment due to farming in the case of maize whose cultivation is optimised in most part of the world the effect of farming techniques on global process sustainability is particularly evident some countries could be able to increase yield to optimal values but only while increasing blue water consumption on the other hand also land is sometimes mismanaged nevertheless in many situations water management is the key parameter to design a sustainable energetic system the analysis of the nexus index makes it evident what the best cultivable crops in the country are giving to decision makers an instrument to understand how to define an energy policy in biofuel production to exploit in the best way the country s resources furthermore the inefficiencies present in the country become evident thanks to the nexus index allowing one to design the best solutions to increase efficiency one of the main potentiality of the nexus index is the possibility to analyse in a simple and direct way the effects of corrective measures used to improve process efficiency and decrease the impact of biofuel production to do so the nexus index can be used in a dynamic way considering the variability of the same over time and comparing the expected effects of new technologies on the results of past changes in this way it is possible also to analyse the effects of climate change on the wef nexus in addition to this the nexus index is capable to determine the possible impact in terms of increased or decreased water and land consumption of important innovations in the field of bioenergy production like a switch to 2nd generation biofuels this is possible because these changes are only modifying some parameters used to generate the nexus index but not the general assumptions the method is relying on moreover it is important to highlight that the nexus index returns the sustainability of 1st generation biofuel in the current scenarios of soil and water technology management climate and soil use and at country scale future improvements translating both in crop s yield increase and or in more efficient water use can be taken into account by the nexus index so describing the effects of agriculture intensification on 1st generation biofuel production acknowledgements this research has been conducted within the master degree program alta scuola

744,this paper assesses the sustainability of bioenergy production under a nexus perspective through a new efficiency type index the index describes 1st generation biofuel production under the perspective of the implied consumption of natural resources we consider the sustainability of energy production as a sequence of steps each characterised by its efficiency and propose an index which returns an overall efficiency value describing the adequacy or inadequacy of the considered processes under a nexus perspective the direct application of the nexus index entails an indication of the possible improvements needed to move production towards most sustainable processes or places moreover it allows evaluating the efficiency of the main crops currently used in biofuel production with respect to the water food energy nexus the results depict countries presently capable of performing sustainable production of 1st generation biofuel from particular crops furthermore the analysis of the single components of the nexus index allows understanding the effects of possible improvements e g soil and water management new generation biofuels on the overall production efficiency under a nexus perspective keywords food energy water nexus bioenergy 1st generation biofuels energy efficiency 1 introduction some of the most debated topics for science in the 21st century are related to energy availability and production iea 2014 johansson 2013 the need for more energy due to population increase and global economic growth is conflicting with the request of lower co2 emissions and decrease our reliance on fossil fuels edenhofer et al 2011 the concern for food security water scarcity and land consumption are becoming day by day more important and these aspects are far from being independent from energy production and use the strict link among energy food and water is generally referred to as the water food energy nexus sanders 2015 it is impossible to bound the analysis of energy production to a single limited sector because actions aimed to locally optimise the efficiency can at the end cause the settling of the global system to a condition worse than the initial one dubreuil et al 2013 in this context the production of biofuels is a point of great debate amongst scholars recently decision makers have given many incentives to the production of energy from renewable resources finding in biofuels a good opportunity to decrease co2 emissions eu parliament 2009 eu commission 2010 us congress 2005 us congress 2007 iea 2012 in fact biofuels can decrease co2 emissions in energy production with respect to fossil fuels since they produce energy from a feedstock with lower life cycle time bentsen and felby 2012 da costa et al 2010 campbell et al 2008 dornburg et al 2010 at the same time they can increase the quote of self produced energy for many countries amineh and crijns graus 2014 thöne et al 2009 favero and pettenella 2014 nevertheless the use of edible crops as feedstock for energy conversion is in direct competition with food production harvey and pilgrim 2011 affecting water and land management this is due to the higher request of crops caused by the simultaneous demand for food and feedstock for energy production gude 2015 moreover the crop yield is often increased by massive irrigation giving a higher food production but accompanied by a low efficiency in the use of water resources the design of energy production systems carried out taking into account all these aspects is a challenging duty a specific design method is far from being completely defined howells 2013 the current energy food and freshwater supply systems are optimised to give the maximum possible output in terms of the commodity or and source they are designed to produce or deliver cosgrove and louck 2015 hejazi et al 2015 this leads to the creation of systems which are efficient in their own scope but which are far away from the absolute optimal point in terms of sustainable use of water and energy resources under a food energy water hereafter few nexus perspective many authors have analysed the single subcomponents of water food energy nexus and many indicators exist to analyse the effect of 1st generation biofuel as a definition 1st generation biofuels are liquid fuels produced directly from crops otherwise used for food production this distinguishes these products from the fuels obtained from conversion of waste 2nd generation or non food crops production in terms of water use and depletion competition with food and land consumption for example indicators of water and land use for biofuel production already assess the impact of bioenergy production of any single natural resource they are dealing with rulli et al 2016 however just few attempts of analysing the interlinks between food energy and water in biofuel production have been done d odorico et al 2018 and at our knowledge no indicator does exist to take in bioenergy production under few nexus perspective historically two different works set the basis to define and analyse the concept of water food energy nexus in the limits to growth meadows et al 1972 important insights in the problem were given but these hints did not form a single tool suitable for policy makers this study placed the first milestone for the sustainability assessment but it did not address the wef nexus as a whole few years later the method welmm grenon and lapillonne 1976 was developed directly focusing on five connected resources water energy land materials and manpower this methodology provided the first example of dataset used for sustainability assessment but it did not involve an integrated analysis useful under a wef perspective nowadays the way is still open for the development of integrated assessment models tol 2006 this study proposes a new methodology for the few description considering all the aspects of this concept and summarising them in a single simple indicator most of the existing models consider the single relationships energy land and energy water use however most of the available tools do not address the problem as a whole the commonly used methods for energy system analysis include message messner and strubegger 1995 markal zonooz et al 2009 leap heaps 2012 models on the other side the weap stockholm environment institute 2011 model is often used for water system planning these models while providing useful information in their application field lack the data and methodological components required to conduct an integrated policy assessment bazilian 2011 a tool which should be simple enough to be useful for policy makers but precise enough to well describe the current energy production under a nexus perspective is still missing here we propose a new index which resumes in one single output the effect of 1st generation biofuel energy production on sustainability under a few nexus perspective the index is aimed to analyse the interrelationship among water food and energy in 1st generation biofuel production at the global scale and to assess the sustainability of biofuel production from a specific crop in a single country for this purpose the various components of the few nexus are studied in detail for biofuel production from any specific crop and in order to define an efficiency type index the use of the resources water food and land is compared to a reference value i e the least impacting use of the specific resource this new index does not substitute the existing tools used for the analysis of the single aspects of the few nexus but it integrates and complements them giving a preliminary assessment of the complex interrelations between the components of the few nexus 2 methodological framework the design of an index assessing the few nexus should follow the deep understanding of the punctual indicators characterising the single aspects of the nexus itself for this reason we recall here some literature resources useful to address the single facets of the problem 2 1 water since this paper is focused on biofuel production it is necessary to have tools for analysing the water required to produce a reference quantity of energy from biofuels water is not only used in energy conversion but it is virtually contained in crops used as feedstock because they require large amounts of water to grow finley and seiber 2014 a concept of principal importance in this field is virtual water antonelli and sartori 2015 virtual water is an indicator used to describe the quantity of water required to produce a specific industrial output allan 1993 this indicator is widely used to describe the embedded water in traded goods as shown in the example of virtual water trade antonelli and sartori 2015 however the virtual water concept is designed to assess the water embedded only in physical goods when a commodity is used to produce other goods derived goods in further processes the virtual water concept results not sufficient antonelli and sartori 2015 to extend the concept to derived goods the water footprint indicator was developed water footprint changes the perspective with reference to virtual water the former indicator allows the determination of the quantity of water used in production of goods and services while the latter allows the quantification of the amount of water used during the process of consuming the same goods and services chapagain and hoeksrta et al 2003 water footprint is a fundamental concept since it allows defining in a precise way the amount of water required to produce bioenergy many studies are devoted to this topic grebens leenes et al 2009 velazquez et al 2011 the results of these studies will be used as a starting point in defining our water efficiency index see section 3 but they describe only a single aspect of a complex problem they allow determining the quantity of water needed throughout the production chain of biofuels but they allow neither to understand the renewability of the water used nor to relate it to the resources effectively used during production the sustainability of the water use has been related to a sort of hierarchy in the typology of water sources with some sources more valuable than others also from an economic point of view chapagain and hoekstra 2004 to address this problem the concepts of green and blue water were defined blue water refers to the liquid water above and below the ground rivers lakes and groundwater green water is the soil water in the unsaturated zone derived from precipitations gerbens leenes et al 2009 only green water is usually considered a renewable resource in the strict sense mekonnen and hoekstra 2010 both green and blue water are intensively used in agriculture but blue water is used in direct competition with other human uses e g industries municipalities rulli and d odorico 2013 we do not consider grey water in this analysis because of the scarce accuracy and spatial homogeneity of the available grey water footprint estimators novo et al 2009 falkenmark 1986 mancosu et al 2015 the separation of blue and green water is therefore useful to understand the overall sustainability of the process under a water perspective in particular because analysing the blue water footprint allows one to quantify the impact of biofuel production on renewable resources the share of renewable resources used for biofuel production is therefore used as the main component of our water quality indicator also considering the separation between the blue and green water footprint one is left with a water efficiency indicator which lacks information about the abundance or scarcity of water in the production place water availability is accounted for by considering the world data bank water withdrawal index as a further determinant of the index see section 3 2 2 food the second element to be discussed in a water food energy nexus analysis is the possible interaction of biofuel production with food production including both commodities used for human and animal nutrition we do not aim to consider separately for each crop the amount of food which is subtracted to human consumption by biofuel production because this kind of analysis would involve dietary and nutritional facets which are beyond the scope of the paper in contrast we want to include in our index the simple concept that at the country scale human crop consumption should be favoured with respect to the crop use for energy production when malnutrition affects a non negligible portion of the country s population the reference concept in this field is thus food security food security is defined as a situation that exists when all people at all times have physical social and economic access to sufficient safe and nutritious food that meets their dietary needs and food preferences for an active and healthy life fao 2003 while this definition is rather simple it is difficult to turn this expression into a quantitative index which states the effects of food insecurity worldwide we therefore refer in the definition of our food efficiency index in section 3 to a very simple and well agreed concept to at least roughly characterise food security in a country the prevalence of malnutrition as defined by fao in each country 2 3 land the third element to be investigated in the analysis is land land is the basic resource needed in agriculture and the quantification of land required to produce a defined amount of crop is a point of capital importance models are required to have a good understanding of the efficiency in exploiting this resource for any purpose the key parameter in agriculture is crop yield defined as the quantity of crop produced for ha of land used gebbers and adamchuk 2010 crops yield depends on crop type climate cultivar soil and terrain conditions level of inputs water and fertilizers and management yield data suffer similar problems as data of food security because they are mainly the results of statistical measurements only punctual data are precise but the recovery of such data is hard and they are not always suitable for further studies the use of average or country based data gives less precise indications on land yield but in many cases these are the only data available or usable barret et al 2002 another important feature to be considered in a sustainability assessment of land use is the quantity of land available and suitable for agriculture together with agricultural intensification and increased application of fertilisers and pesticides the expansion in cultivated area is the key factor for the increase in food production observed over the last 50 years khan and hanjra 2008 the total global agricultural area has expanded by 11 to 5 billion ha and the arable land area has expanded from 1 27 to 1 4 billion ha faostat 2014 more land has been converted to cropping in the 30 years after 1960 than in the 150 years between 1700 and 1850 faostat 2014 these data are fundamental to understand the possible further increase in agricultural production and if the use of land is compatible to a sustainable development and changing climate regimes 3 materials and methods in order to assess the effects of biofuel production on global sustainability under a water food energy nexus perspective the current production of biofuels is evaluated by means of a new index which we call the nexus index ni we calculate the nexus index for the most important crops used in biofuel production the list of considered crops is reported in table 1 the index is designed to evaluate the resources required in terms of water food and land to produce one unit of energy fig 1 the formula of the nexus index is 1 n i η w a t e r η f o o d η l a n d which is the mathematical description of a system similar to the one shown in fig 1 where the use of three resources water food and land is necessary to get the final output energy ni is the nexus index η water is the efficiency in water use η food the efficiency with respect to food production and η land is the efficiency in the use of land the first term η water is linked to the water used for crop production stating an efficiency with respect to the lowest quantity of water that is possible to use in a specific process the second term η food is country related and describes the effects of the competition between biofuel and food production the third term η land takes into account the quantity of land required to produce one unit of product again referring to the best attainable performance this method allows comparing different systems providing a result in the range between 0 and 1 in order to get a good score a process must work with the best available technology preventing the resources from being depleted and guarantee the water and food security and a rigorous use of land the three parts have the same weight in the index so that the inefficiency in a single step is directly translated into the result the multiplication of 3 different factors is chosen in order to increase the influence the inefficiency of any single aspect of the index in fact thanks to the theory of limiting effects if only one factor is not efficiently managed the value of the index results strongly penalised this form is preferred to other possible mathematical formulations e g additive form to avoid the need of weighting factors which would include more arbitrary choices in the index definition the number of factors is limited to three to have a compromise between complexity in the data mining phase and precision of the index the three factors determine the influence of biofuel production on the three most important elements that affects the water food energy nexus water use land consumption and food availability giving a simple but precise indicator of efficiency in the following each component of the nexus index is described in detail 3 1 water efficiency the water efficiency index is introduced for assessing the use of water related to biofuel production to this aim this index considers both the amount of water and the source of water used for crop production i e soil moisture due to precipitation that is the so called green water or irrigation water the so called blue water required to produce a pre defined amount of energy via biofuels the water efficiency is here expressed as the product of two terms 2 η w a t e r η w a t e r q u a n t η w a t e r s o u r c e the two terms are equally important and determine the efficiency of water use in biofuel production both for the quantity of water used and for the quality of this water the first part of this index refers to the quantity of water used in the steps required to produce the crop adopted for energetic purposes and to convert it into liquid fuel in order to assess this quantity the water footprint of energy from a selected crop has been calculated following the approach introduced by gerben lenens et al 2009 we then divide the bioenergy water footprint in m3 mj by the lowest global value of the bioenergy water footprint which corresponds to the highest efficiency the reverse of this ratio is an efficiency lying in the desired range of values 0 1 the resulting formula is 3 η w a t e r q u a n t w f m i n w f i where η water quant is the quantitative part of water efficiency wfi is the water footprint of bioenergy from selected crop of the country i wfmin is the minimum water footprint of bioenergy for the selected crop at the global scale the hyperbolic form is chosen after a sensitivity analysis which showed that this form provides the most realistic results other functional forms e g exponential would make the index more complicated with an increased computational complexity not compensated by a higher accuracy this part of the index needs being complemented with some additional information on the water used for this purpose it is important to consider the effect of water footprint according to the availability of freshwater resources in a region moreover there is a great difference if the water used in biofuel production comes from irrigation blue water footprint or from soil water green water footprint to quantify these aspects a specific index is defined the starting point to calculate this effect is the ratio between green water footprint of biofuel production according to gerben lenens et al 2009 and the total water footprint the maximum value equal to 1 is reached if only green water i e only a renewable resource is used to produce biofuel to penalise countries where water is less abundant we consider the following definition 4 η w a t e r s o u r c e w f g r e e n w f t o t w w i where η water source is the source related part of water efficiency wfgreen is the green water footprint of biofuel production wftot is the total water footprint of biofuel production and wwi is the calculated water withdrawals index this exponent is calculated according to data on water withdrawals coming from the world bank data world bank 2014 this index assumes increasing values according to the water withdrawal rate of a specific country the water withdrawal index used here is defined as 5 w w i w a t e r w i t h d r a w a l s 3 2 food efficiency the food efficiency component of the nexus index aims to account for the potential competition for flexible crops crops usable both for nutrition and energy purposes between food and biofuel sectors in food insecure countries the data from faostat describing the prevalence of undernourishment faostat 2014 are used to assess food efficiency this indicator m i assumes values between 0 and 1 and expresses the percentage of population within a country that does not consume a sufficient amount of food this value is then adjusted with an exponent α that aims at penalising the countries more affected by this phenomenon this parameter α is set at 5 a value chosen after a sensitivity analysis showing that larger α values produce more sensible results and for values of α greater then 5 η food is stable the resulting formula is 6 η f o o d 1 m i α where η food is the food efficiency and m i is the prevalence of malnutrition according to faostat 2014 food efficiency as defined here is not crop based but it considers the food security condition of a country because we do not aim to consider the energy food competition for each crop but the overall nutritional picture for each country 3 3 land efficiency the main aim of the land efficiency index is the evaluation of the impact of biofuel production on the availability of cultivable land in a specific country to do so similarly to the case of water efficiency it is necessary to consider both the use of the resource land and its availability the efficiency in using land for growing a certain crop is defined as the crop yield registered in the specific country divided by the maximum value of the crop yield reachable with the current technology i e the maximum yield registered worldwide faostat 2014 these data are provided by fao faostat in order to account for the country available land suitable for agriculture not already used a country specific land used index lu is developed this index is the ratio between the land already used for agriculture the arable land in faostat and the total area suitable for agriculture in a specific country we selected the extent of very suitable suitable or moderately suitable land for mixed input under rain fed and or irrigation conditions for all crops as reported by gaez 2014 finally the land component of the ni is 7 η l a n d y i e l d i y i e l d m a x l u where η land is the land efficiency yieldi is the yield for the considered crop in the country i yieldmax is the maximum possible yield for the specific crop and lu is the land used index similarly to the case of source water efficiency the hyperbolic form is chosen to have a right balance between the two contributions use and availability of the resource 4 results and discussion for applying the proposed methodology the nexus index for various crops used in 1st generation biofuel production was calculated in order to have a homogeneous and complete framework avoiding the problems due to the differences in the used databases the calculation was limited to 191 countries eliminating incongruent data coming from countries with incomplete or unreliable statistical data the number of available countries depends on the distribution of the crop in the world the total number of countries with a calculated nexus index for each crop is shown in table 2 the study is performed with the data referred to year 2014 largely diffused crops like maize rice wheat and soybean have a large quantity of available data because they are cultivated and used as feedstock for biofuels in most part of the considered countries on the other hand for less diffused cultivations like sorghum and oil palm the number of countries in which the nexus index can be calculated is quite low table 2 also reports the localisation of the highest score for each considered crop this depends on the area where the climate is most suitable for cultivation but also on the efficiency of cultivation techniques the maximum values attainable have a great variability fig 2 with crops characterised by high maximum efficiency especially wheat and crops with low maximum efficiency e g sorghum the method is designed to give excellent results when one country is highly efficient in all of the steps composing nexus index this means that crops cultivated with minimum water requirement maximum agricultural yield and without competing with food production will give high scores mismanagement of only one of these steps strongly decreases the overall performance the most produced crops have in general the highest maximal efficiency this is a natural consequence of the intensive research performed in the past to improve agricultural yield for these species fisher et al 2002 on the other hand some crops with low diffusion e g palm oil also score good results this is mainly due to the high specialisation in these cultivations that some countries were able to establish in some cases due to the high profitability of such cash crops the maxima are only representative of the global capability to reach good scores in the nexus index to have a complete understanding of the world performance it is necessary to discuss the results in detail for the selected crop as an example results for maize are discussed in the following section the results for the other crops limited to the cases with more than 50 countries available are reported as maps in the supplementary material the results of the single elements of the proposed index can be compared with the indicators representing the components of the few nexus available in literature to verify the consistency of the results 4 1 nexus index for maize maize is one of the most produced commodities in the world and it is widely used as a feedstock for biofuel production rulli et al 2016 this makes maize an interesting crop to be analysed as mentioned the maximum value for the nexus index for maize is 0 611 and it is reached in belgium the maximum value is not high stating the existence of inefficiencies in bioethanol production the general analysis of the nexus index is displayed in fig 3 as a map and the values for top 10 countries are reported in table 3 the number of countries with scores close to the highest values is not large this means that despite the large diffusion of maize at the global scale inefficiencies are widely present and in many cases the current bioethanol production does not fulfil the requirements of sustainability under a wfe nexus perspective the geographical distribution of scores does not show specific areas where bioethanol production is particularly favourable or penalised in all continents there are countries with nexus index values close to the maximum in general the largest values are found in industrialised countries most of the countries with low scores are in the sub saharan africa other inefficient countries are placed in the area comprised between the middle east and the indian subcontinent the discussion of the single components of the nexus index will disentangle the problems that make some countries not efficient 4 1 1 water efficiency quantitative water efficiency strongly influences the index because it directly states the quantity of water needed to produce bioethanol in a specific country results are shown in fig 4 maize is suitable to be grown in many climates so that its cultivation is diffused in many areas of the world the cultivation techniques have been refined in all the industrialised countries since long time ago for this reason in these places it is not possible to determine areas where the cultivation is particular efficient this relative homogeneity of the results is because the quantity of water required for growing maize is quite similar in almost all the industrialised countries specific country water and soil management does not significantly change the crop water footprint conversely other countries such as most of the sub saharan african and south east asian countries are penalised in this index because of the large quantity of water required to cultivate maize both in term of crop water requirement and as crop water footprint this large need of water can derive both from climate conditions that determine higher crop water requirement and from production inefficiency low yield that results in low production per unit of water used we will distinguish between the two phenomena while discussing the quality based water efficiency the source water green vs blue water efficiency completes the information on sustainable use of water in biofuel production the situation described by the source water efficiency is largely different from the previous part of the index fig 5 we notice that the scale of the results is extremely narrow the lowest value is 0 77 this means that maize is produced in the great majority of countries using mainly green water resources interestingly some of the countries with high level of source water efficiency have at the same time a low score in quantitative water efficiency this is the case of brazil of many sub saharan african countries and of some countries of the asian southeast this is a clear clue of the high crop water requirement of maize in these countries other countries have high quantitative water efficiency and relatively low source water efficiency these countries e g the usa western europe and china produce maize using low quantities of water green blue but with a considerable contribution coming from irrigation 4 1 2 food efficiency the second component of the nexus index is food efficiency this index is by definition independent of the biomass considered the results are displayed in fig 6 most of the world s countries have the maximum score but in africa south america and southeastern asia some countries are not efficient in providing food to their population 4 1 3 land efficiency land use efficiency characterises the last part of water food energy nexus assessing the appropriate use of land in crop production the results for maize are displayed in fig 7 this index is linked to quantitative water efficiency but with some exceptions in fact agricultural yield crop water requirements and irrigation are strictly connected usually large use of irrigation can guarantee high agricultural yield but this is not necessarily the case furthermore agricultural yield is part of the definition of water footprint so that a high yield can decrease the water footprint these complex relationships highlight the need of a punctual analysis of the situation for every single crop in the specific case of maize we can notice that the distribution of scores for land efficiency is sensibly different from the quantitative water efficiency most of the industrialised countries have low values of land efficiency opposite to the high values of water efficiency this is due to the focus in the rationalisation of use of water in cultivation the use of water is adjusted to the optimal point but this does not correspond to the highest level of crop yield furthermore in these countries most of the suitable land is already dedicated to intensive cultivation preventing the possibility of increasing the production a case of particular interest is belgium leading country in nexus index ranking in belgium water and food efficiency have the maximum value while land efficiency results the bottleneck of the biofuel production process in this country land suitable to be cropped does exist but the ratio between the maize crop yield in belgium and the maximum yield in the world is low 0 5 some other nations are characterised by low scores in water efficiency but also by high crop yield this is the case of some small countries e g israel where the little land available for cultivation is exploited in a highly efficient way the analysis of sub saharan countries gives some other interesting hints most of the countries penalised in quantitative water efficiency have high land efficiency scores this is due to the large quantity of land available for cultivation in these countries maize production can be increased without decreasing the nexus index measures to make these countries more efficient should first focus on the reduction of the water footprint the good management of water is in general a key point to generate a sustainable biofuel production system 5 conclusions the sustainability of 1st generation biofuel production at the global scale is assessed through the definition of a new index called the nexus index the output of the method is a score which defines the efficiency of the production of biofuels the index is the product of three intermediate indexes that quantify all the key parameters in biofuel production the nexus index determines if a country is efficiently managing biofuel production from a specific crop defining the lowest attainable consumption of resources in this process the results of the analysis provide the starting point for considerations concerning geographic differences in biofuel production even if we acknowledge the sub country spatial variability of resources availability and demand the country scale of analysis is chosen in order to have homogenous and reliable results because often only at country level all the required information for water food and land is available efficiency in production of biofuels from the same crop can be very different from one country to another this is due to differences in agricultural yield but also to differences in resources deployment due to farming in the case of maize whose cultivation is optimised in most part of the world the effect of farming techniques on global process sustainability is particularly evident some countries could be able to increase yield to optimal values but only while increasing blue water consumption on the other hand also land is sometimes mismanaged nevertheless in many situations water management is the key parameter to design a sustainable energetic system the analysis of the nexus index makes it evident what the best cultivable crops in the country are giving to decision makers an instrument to understand how to define an energy policy in biofuel production to exploit in the best way the country s resources furthermore the inefficiencies present in the country become evident thanks to the nexus index allowing one to design the best solutions to increase efficiency one of the main potentiality of the nexus index is the possibility to analyse in a simple and direct way the effects of corrective measures used to improve process efficiency and decrease the impact of biofuel production to do so the nexus index can be used in a dynamic way considering the variability of the same over time and comparing the expected effects of new technologies on the results of past changes in this way it is possible also to analyse the effects of climate change on the wef nexus in addition to this the nexus index is capable to determine the possible impact in terms of increased or decreased water and land consumption of important innovations in the field of bioenergy production like a switch to 2nd generation biofuels this is possible because these changes are only modifying some parameters used to generate the nexus index but not the general assumptions the method is relying on moreover it is important to highlight that the nexus index returns the sustainability of 1st generation biofuel in the current scenarios of soil and water technology management climate and soil use and at country scale future improvements translating both in crop s yield increase and or in more efficient water use can be taken into account by the nexus index so describing the effects of agriculture intensification on 1st generation biofuel production acknowledgements this research has been conducted within the master degree program alta scuola
