2515,hydrogeologists are trained to think about belowground processes and their importance is apparent to them other scientific disciplines have traditionally emphasized processes that occur on or above earth s surface and thus groundwater s roles sometimes go unnoticed in studies of weather climate and plant diversity and traits among others over her career ying fan has persistently highlighted the critical importance of groundwater processes on global climate surface hydrology and vegetation as well as the need to improve the representation of these processes in earth system models here we review fan s scientific contributions and frame them within some of the simple yet profound questions that she asks how deep is groundwater where when and how does groundwater affect weather and climate where and when is groundwater a dominant driver of vegetation s spatial patterns across the landscape how deep do roots grow we examine these questions through the valuable insights gained from the work by fan her colleagues and mentees and other works that preceded them highlighting impacts of fan s work on the scientific community keywords groundwater plant rooting depth wetlands earth system modeling climate modeling data availability no data was used for the research described in the article 1 introduction here we celebrate the scholarship and scientific contributions of ying fan professor of earth and planetary sciences at rutgers university new brunswick fig 1 throughout her career fan has repeatedly highlighted the critical importance of groundwater processes on global climate surface hydrology and vegetation as well as the need to realistically represent groundwater in earth system models esms esms simulate the numerous physical chemical and biogeochemical interactions over large scales such as within and among the atmosphere the land and the ocean to predict global environmental change fan 2015 clark et al 2015 fan et al 2019 in conversation fan refers to these models as humanity s few crystal balls to divine our future climate fan s interests have led her to ask questions that span various scientific fields and earth surface processes in addition to hydrology e g meteorology ecology landscape evolution weathering nonetheless her work applies core principles of hydrology to whatever field she pursues for example the hillslope is emphasized throughout fan s work as a key physical scale as a fundamental distributor of water from hilltop to valley the hillslope has long been appreciated by hydrologists as a crucial unit of landscape topography to better understand the spatial patterns in hydrology land atmosphere fluxes weathering and vegetation across the globe fan s work attests to her deep reading and synthesis of scientific literature and keen ability to connect processes with specific sites across the globe e g fan miguez macho 2010 2011 2013 miguez macho fan 2012a fan 2015 fan et al 2017 2019 fan s efforts invested into data and information synthesis include revisiting long overlooked studies contacting government agencies across the globe to acquire data otherwise not used in scientific studies and diligently translating papers in unfamiliar languages often with the aid of google s translation service multiple generations of her mentees recall her enthusiasm for her work recollecting separate instances of fan s tangible eagerness to inspect the roots of trees overturned by recent storms gleefully confirming this or that insight about which she had read not long before we also recall fan being a remarkably supportive educator and mentor to which her exceptional kindness empathy and patience testify thus her enthusiasm is a testimony not only to her directly scientific contributions but also to the generation of scientists that she has inspired fan has asked simple yet profound questions throughout her career which we arrange in two sections in our review notably including a continental to global scale hydrology 11 how deep is groundwater 21 where when and how does groundwater affect land atmosphere fluxes and thus weather and climate b groundwater s impact on vegetation 31 where and when is groundwater crucial to support vegetation and to explain vegetation distributions 41 how deep do roots grow or more specifically do roots grow down to the groundwater table and if so where here we review the key research contributions of ying fan and her collaborators addressing these important science questions q1 q4 fig 2 summarizes fan s career over the last 15 years including her key works and their research themes first we review the insights that fan together with her colleagues and mentees have contributed in response to the first two questions q1 q2 as they both relate to groundwater s global impact on climate this also includes fan s insights on how to incorporate this in modeling hydrology in esms then we review the latter two questions q3 q4 as they relate to groundwater s ecohydrological controls on plant biodiversity and physiology this division between the former and latter two sets of questions however is merely done heuristically to guide this review in reality climate hydrology and vegetation are tightly coupled as demonstrated in fan s work over the last 15 years further demonstrated by fan s regular alternation between closely related research themes fig 2 though we do not focus here on fan s earlier work we note that it foreshadows many of the themes that would persist throughout her career including the spatial heterogeneity of finely resolved hydrologic processes fan duffy 1993 expanding them to catchment scales and beyond fan bras 1995 fan et al 1996 and mechanistic modeling of hydrologic processes fan et al 1997 fan bras 1998 moramarco et al 1999 2 a continental to global scale hydrology bridging the gap between the local scales at which hydrological processes are often studied and the globe has long been recognized as a major challenge e g eagleson 1986 fan and collaborators recognized the nuances of scale that underlies our guiding questions q1 q4 krakauer et al 2014 and have sought to address these questions at the hillslope catchment regional continental and global scales fan recognized the lack of attempts to either synthesize observations of groundwater depth across the globe or simulate groundwater depth globally while some earlier work had implicitly represented groundwater in large scale modeling e g koster et al 2000 ducharne et al 2000 walko et al 2000 chen kumar 2001 seuffert et al 2002 gedney cox 2003 yang niu 2003 niu yang 2003 using the topmodel framework beven kirkby 1979 esms typically do not represent the storage and flow of water in deep soils and rock groundwater surface water interactions the dynamics of the groundwater table and the topographic resolution required to simulate the lateral convergence of runoff and groundwater from drier hilltops and ridges into wetter valleys fan 2015 clark et al 2015 fan et al 2019 instead esms often simulate the subsurface hydrologic processes over a shallow soil column typically only a few meters deep that drains freely at the bottom this drainage is then instantly routed with surface runoff into the ocean unavailable to propagate upward or laterally based on gradients in hydraulic pressure moisten dry soils from below and supply evapotranspiration and streamflow to address our first two questions q1 q2 fan meticulously synthesized groundwater observations fan et al 2013 and together with several collaborators implemented simple yet elegant groundwater and surface hydrology in an esm breaking from the norm fan and collaborators explicitly represented realistic hydrologic mechanisms in their esm by accounting for the physics that describe the movement of water between lakes rivers soils the atmosphere and most exceptionally groundwater miguez macho et al 2007 by developing a large scale model that considers virtually all of the paths for water in the hydrologic cycle whether surficial subterranean or atmospheric fan and collaborators synthesized and unified surface and subsurface hydrology and meteorology they later introduced a novel floodplain scheme that allowed subsurface and surface waters to interact miguez macho fan 2012a in which groundwater particularly upland drainage could supply water to streams and floodplains depleting groundwater stores in the process they focused first on north america as a test bed for continental scale hydrological modeling fan et al 2007 miguez macho et al 2007 anyah et al 2008 miguez macho fan 2008 fan miguez macho 2011 and then to amazonia miguez macho fan 2012a b pokhrel et al 2013 before extending the model to the entire globe fan et al 2013 notably fan s effort to model the complex hydrology of amazonia was a major breakthrough because although amazonian surface water had been well studied e g coe et al 2002 yamazaki et al 2011 2012 the coupling of groundwater and surface water in amazonia had not previously been explicitly modeled their physics based model capable of describing the numerous paths for water in the hydrologic cycle especially those associated with groundwater proved to be robust having been validated against measurements of groundwater depth fan et al 2007 fan et al 2011 2013 miguez macho fan 2012a soil moisture miguez macho et al 2007 2008 miguez macho fan 2012b streamflow miguez macho et al 2007 miguez macho fan 2012a precipitation anyah et al 2008 evapotranspiration miguez macho fan 2012b wetland distribution fan miguez macho 2011 2013 seasonal flooding miguez macho fan 2012a and satellite based estimates of terrestrial water storage pokhrel et al 2013 2 1 q1 how deep is groundwater from their global groundwater modeling and synthesis of literature and data fan and collaborators addressed q1 by demonstrating that shallow groundwater 5 m is common globally fig 3 regardless of climate or local precipitation fan et al 2007 miguez macho et al 2007 miguez macho fan 2012b fan miguez macho 2010 2013 groundwater is shallow among humid climates but it may also be shallow in valleys across the globe where groundwater and surface water descend by gravity from uplands into valleys that is climate predominantly drives groundwater depth at regional scales while topography is the dominant control of groundwater depth at hillslope and catchment scales fan miguez macho 2013 fan et al 2015 hence regardless of regional climate topography redistributes moisture through lateral groundwater and stream flows across hillslope and catchment scales maintaining valley soils that are moister than their adjacent upland soils 2 2 q2 where and when does groundwater affect weather and climate the topographic redistribution of moisture results in a mosaic of wet valley soils and dry upland soils this heterogeneity in soil moisture is known to have profound impacts on regional meteorology avissar pielke 1989 chen avissar 1994 mahrt 2000 huang margulis 2009 altering the spatial distribution of evapotranspiration precipitation and heat fluxes thus the same modeling approach by fan and collaborators also addresses q2 they showed that where evapotranspiration is regionally water limited i e drier climates the convergence of water towards valleys locally alleviates such water limitations enhancing evapotranspiration in valleys and contributing to the local water balance there fan et al 2007 miguez macho et al 2007 miguez macho fan 2012b fan miguez macho 2010 2013 wetlands and desert oases are examples of this convergence fan miguez macho 2011 miguez macho fan 2012a fan 2015 fan et al 2019 in fact wetlands are typically identified by the presence of high soil moisture without consideration of the source of this moisture often implicitly assuming precipitation as the source contrarily fan s model demonstrated large swathes of stable coastal wetlands are supported by groundwater convergence towards sea level the boundary condition for groundwater along the coast fan miguez macho 2011 miguez macho fan 2012a accordingly on one hand shallow groundwater is often apparent at large scales in humid climates fan et al 2007 fan et al 2013 fig 3 while on the other hand the inclusion of groundwater in their esm had the largest impact on simulated evapotranspiration in drier climates by wetting valley soils from below miguez macho et al 2007 anyah et al 2008 similarly schaller and fan 2009 demonstrated that the contribution of groundwater to stream flow is typically greatest in arid climates where stream discharge often exceeds the difference between precipitation and evapotranspiration and thus where groundwater must be imported to support perennial streams hence groundwater affects climate across the globe and exerts its strongest control on weather and climate in valleys of arid regions especially where elevations are low and thus where groundwater is shallow in addition to how groundwater continually exports water from uplands to lowlands and thus decouples soil moisture and evapotranspiration spatially from regional precipitation patterns groundwater and soil moisture are temporally decoupled from precipitation events groundwater levels often track rain events with a delay though often they do not respond to small rain events eltahir yeh 1999 weider boutt 2010 and the response of groundwater levels in lowlands to rain events lags the upland response by many years decades centuries and even millennium tóth 1963 bethke johnson 2008 schaller fan 2009 cuthbert ashley 2014 this temporal decoupling between precipitation and groundwater is the result of two major lags fan et al 2015 first there exists a lag between the local groundwater rise and precipitation due to the time for precipitation to infiltrate surface soils and percolate down to the groundwater table as well as due to other dynamic groundwater losses a second lag exists due to the continual albeit slow lateral flow of groundwater from hilltops to valleys which supplies valleys with groundwater from hilltops long after a rain event and causes the valley groundwater rise to peak later than the peak in the hilltop these lags are not so easily separable in actuality and we separate them heuristically for example the lateral groundwater flow from uplands to lowlands associated with the second lag further lengthens first lag the time for local groundwater to rise in uplands by continually losing upland groundwater further dampening the upland groundwater response to precipitation hence groundwater acts as an important buffer stabilizing the temporal variations in soil moisture especially in lowlands which are continually supplied by upland groundwater reserves even long after a rain event fan and collaborators demonstrated that these groundwater dynamics indeed maintain moist soils and support evapotranspiration rates in lowland valleys long after the last rain event such as during dry seasons miguez macho et al 2007 miguez macho fan 2012a b pokhrel et al 2014 fan et al 2019 all in all groundwater affects weather and climate most during dry seasons and groundwater will become increasingly important as droughts intensify and become more frequent in the future pokhrel et al 2014 notably these roles of groundwater on weather and climate are dependent on whether groundwater is shallow enough to impact the moisture of surface soils and evapotranspiration leading to the question of how shallow must groundwater be to impact surface hydrologic processes fan explored this line of thought first by analyzing the capillary rise of groundwater miguez macho et al 2008 and later by redirecting her focus to the questions of how deep do roots grow and can roots access deep groundwater q4 we review fan s insights on roots and groundwater access later in section b 2 3 modeling global hydrology given fan s deep understanding of how climate systems work and groundwater s impact on climate across scales fan has strongly advocated for improving the representation of groundwater in esms proposing and demonstrating the feasibility of mechanistic computationally efficient approaches to model hydrological processes at large scales fan 2015 clark et al 2015 fan et al 2019 indeed interests and efforts to represent hydrological processes lateral groundwater and runoff convergence in esms and other large scale models has surged in the past decade clark et al 2015 fan et al 2019 felfelani et al 2021 including representing deep water storage in rock fractures e g hartmann et al 2015 2017 vrettas fung 2017 2015 any modeling effort to represent groundwater however is constrained by the limited amount of data on soil and rock hydraulic properties with depth e g bedrock depth porosity conductivity fan et al 2015 clark et al 2015 fan et al 2019 to circumvent this challenge for esms fan and collaborators proposed empirical modeling the hydraulic conductivity of surface soils from soil texture classes clapp hornberger 1978 derived from digital soil maps unesco food and agriculture organization https www fao org nr land soils digital soil map of the world en statsgo https soildatamart nrcs usda gov sdmdb gsmfull htm fan et al 2013 additionally they employed the concept that conductivity exponentially declines with depth beven kirkby 1979 reflecting the increasing overburden pressures on geologic materials with depth e g terzaghi 1925 and weathering processes to estimate the conductivity of deep soils and rock in their model given that the weathering sedimentation balance depends strongly on terrain slope hooke 2000 fan and collaborators proposed to formulate the rate at which conductivity declines exponentially with depth as a function of topographic slope fan et al 2007 this approach has since been adopted in continental scale modeling studies e g gleeson et al 2016 martinez et al 2016 maxwell condon 2016 zhang et al 2016 though being an effective first order approximation this approach greatly simplifies the complex roles of geology climate and biology on the vertical distribution of the properties of geologic materials fan et al 2015 2019 proposed that this approach could be improved by integrating global lithological maps of geologic provinces and rock types hartmann moosdorf 2012 as well as global estimates of permeability based on rock types gleeson et al 2011 2014 huscroft et al 2018 in fact to fill the gap of limited data on hydraulic properties fan et al 2015 proposed an action plan to develop an interdisciplinary global data infrastructure where the geoscientists could contribute register access and visualize data of earth s upper crust referred to as the digitalcrust fan envisioned that this digitalcrust would accommodate the structure and physical chemical and biological properties of the upper crust in both space and time assimilating observational data and interpretations from all available sources including geologic maps cross sections and structural contours hydrogeologic unit delineations soil tests slug tests aquifer pump tests and indirect property estimates obtained through model inversions realistically modeling hydrology in esms is also computationally challenging because representing the hillslope processes that govern flow especially surface flow requires relatively fine spatial resolutions e g krakauer et al 2014 making long term simulations computationally expensive esms were originally designed to run on grid cell sizes 100 km fan 2015 pokhrel et al 2016 that are too coarse to resolve hillslope and catchment scale hydrologic processes while some have argued that recent computational advances allow esms to be solved at hyperresolutions that can resolve such fine scale hydrologic processes wood et al 2011 others disagree beven et al 2015 arguing that hyperresolution may further increase model bias due to the uncertainty of the additional parameterizations required at such fine resolution fan et al 2019 proposed a reasonable alternative to represent hillslope and catchment scales processes within esm grid cells to avoid the additional uncertainties owing from hyperresolutions while improving computational efficiency specifically they expanded on the practice of dividing grid cells into multiple individually modeled equivalent or representative hillslopes hazenberg et al 2015 ajami et al 2016 an approach that has already been introduced and applied in esms milly et al 2014 subin et al 2014 chaney et al 2018 fan et al 2019 advanced this approach by proposing to subdivide each hillslope by the grid cell s internal distribution of height above the nearest drainage hand nobre et al 2011 rather than by the typically used elevation e g nijssen et al 1997 hand represents a location s ability to drain and has the advantage of being correlated with groundwater depth soil moisture and soil texture nobre et al 2011 as well as floristic compositions schietti et al 2014 simplifying parameterization of hydrologic properties along the representative hillslope this approach means that grid cell heterogeneity may be represented by a single slope hand is a useful tool for representing spatial heterogeneity within hydrologic models cuartas et al 2012 and has recently been used to subdivide esm grid cells and improve river routing chaney et al 2021 3 b groundwater s impact on vegetation large scale patterns in precipitation have long been known to drive broad patterns in plant diversity e g mutke barthlott 2005 kreft jetz 2007 historically without consideration of finer scale drivers such as valley to hilltop soil moisture and groundwater depth gradients similarly early meta analyses on rooting depth canadell et al 1996 jackson et al 1996 schenk and jackson 2002a 2005 emphasized large scale regional characteristics like soil texture vegetation type or biome and large scale climate patterns e g precipitation potential evapotranspiration as drivers of rooting depth diverging from these large scale controls the work by fan and collaborators has advanced hillslope scale patterns of groundwater access as a fundamental driver of plant diversity and rooting depth at much finer scales than were previously considered here we focus on how fan and collaborators addressed q3 q4 3 1 q3 where and when does groundwater support vegetation through global groundwater modeling and synthesis of literature fan and collaborators have demonstrated where and when groundwater supports plants water demands over large scale regional patterns in climate fan and collaborators have shown that groundwater supports the transpiration of plants in arid and semiarid regions humid regions of low relief e g wetlands fan miguez macho 2011 miguez macho fan 2012a and wherever seasonal water status greatly varies between a plentiful wet season and a pronounced dry season e g eastern amazonia mediterranean type climates especially where topographic relief is moderate to high fan 2015 fan et al 2019 groundwater s impact on transpiration in arid and semiarid regions is predominantly restricted to valleys miguez macho fan 2021 where groundwater is shallow and where roots can tap into it fan et al 2017 desert oases are poignant examples of such groundwater dependent arid valleys fan 2015 fan et al 2019 interestingly in both arid and humid climates the vast majority of groundwater that plants transpire is not sourced by local precipitation but instead is sourced in uplands before converging in valleys and lowlands miguez macho fan 2021 hence answering the question of where and when groundwater supports plants transpiration requires analysis at the fine spatial scales at which groundwater affects the water balance especially through substantial lateral flow krakauer et al 2014 highlighting the importance of hillslope and catchment scales in explaining larger scale patterns of plant water use similar to when groundwater affects climate q2 fan and collaborators have demonstrated that groundwater s role in supporting vegetation s water demands is strongest in the dry season miguez macho et al 2007 miguez macho fan 2012a b pokhrel et al 2014 miguez macho fan 2021 and weakest in the wet season when plants preferentially uptake recent precipitation plants greater dependence on groundwater in the dry season partially results from the lag in time between recharge in uplands and lowlands discussed above q2 which temporally decouples local soil moisture from regional precipitation and which supplies additional groundwater during the dry season to valleys improving vegetation resilience pokhrel et al 2013 2014 fan 2015 the greater dependence during the dry season also results from how roots uptake soil water when soil water is heterogeneously distributed with depth roots preferentially uptake water from wettest soil layers with the smallest hydraulic resistances in a manner analogous to electrical circuit connected in parallel fan et al 2017 mackay et al 2020 potkay et al 2021 soil root resistances typically increase with depth due to longer flow paths and because root densities tend to decline with depth jackson et al 1996 schenk jackson 2002a this increase in soil root resistance with depth suggests that roots uptake deep soil water only when surface soils are desiccated and lose conductivity thus during the wet season precipitation wets the ground surface and roots preferentially uptake water from wetter upper soil layers where hydraulic resistances are smallest conversely during the dry season surface soils become depleted of moisture and plants must rely on deep soil water e g groundwater s capillary fringe despite longer flow paths and smaller root densities these spatiotemporal controls of groundwater on transpiration suggest that groundwater can explain patterns in plant diversity where precipitation cannot fan miguez macho 2011 2013 fan 2015 species segregate along fine scale soil moisture gradients silvertown et al 1999 2015 and valley to ridge hillslope position e g schietti et al 2014 suggesting the species have strong affiliations for particular positions along gradients of groundwater depth and its temporal variability similarly plant traits vary intraspecifically along gradients in soil moisture alder et al 1996 and groundwater depth zolfaghar et al 2015 accordingly fan 2015 has hypothesized groundwater as an ecological niche differentiator the role of which is expected to be greatest where plants rely least on recent precipitation and thus where water is distantly sourced and travels through the subsurface for plants to access e g desert oases wetlands by accounting for groundwater this hydrologic niche separation implicitly reflects the complex interplay of geology topography and climate while the common use of precipitation and potential evapotranspiration to explain patterns in plant diversity e g mutke barthlott 2005 kreft jetz 2007 reflects only large scale climate to demonstrate groundwater s global role as a hydrologic niche differentiator fan et al 2019 enumerated examples from across the globe of hydrologic niche separation at hillslope scales that cannot be explained by precipitation alone such as the transition from open savannah on hilltops to rainforests in the eastern congo indeed interest in groundwater as a hydrologic niche differentiator has recently surged e g cosme et al 2017 mclaughlin et al 2017 2020 brum et al 2019 oliveira et al 2019 2021 costa et al 2022 including simulations of plant vulnerability to changing climates through mechanistic models of coupled groundwater and plant physiology e g tai et al 2018 2021 love et al 2019 mackay et al 2020 fan et al 2019 later extended the notion of groundwater as a niche differentiator by examining an additional mechanism by which groundwater may influence species distributions besides water availability per se in particular groundwater controls bedrock weathering rempe dietrich 2014 and thus also nutrient availability clayton 1979 according to which plants indeed segregate e g peñuelas et al 2008 hence groundwater differentiates niches according to both water and nutrient availability while groundwater may impede chemical weathering e g ruxton berry 1959 thomas 1966 where weathering reactions reach equilibrium faster than groundwater can flow away fan 2015 proposed that groundwater incentivizes roots to grow deeper at least where groundwater is deep see below thereby accelerating weathering in some places by physically widening rock fractures nijland et al 2010 schwinning 2013 and increasing the acidity of soils and groundwater maeght et al 2013 richter billings 2015 this root spurred weathering may increase local nutrient availability if groundwater convergence is slow and elsewhere quickly converging groundwater carries recently released nutrients downhill weintraub et al 2017 shi et al 2018 concentrating them in valleys fan 2015 and collaborators boyce et al 2017 theorized that this nexus between groundwater roots weathering and nutrients is key to how terrestrial plants radiated from coasts and river valleys into the continents during the silurian and devonian geologic periods forever changing the earth s land atmosphere and oceans since e g retallack 1997 algeo scheckler 1998 berner 2005 3 2 q4 how deep do roots grow for plants to benefit from groundwater q3 and for deep groundwater to impact weather and climate q2 plants first need to grow roots deep enough to access groundwater this consideration naturally motivated fan s efforts to address the fourth question q4 how deep do roots grow further do roots grow down to the groundwater table if so where early meta analyses showed that rooting depth varies with soil texture vegetation type or biome and large scale climate patterns canadell et al 1996 jackson et al 1996 schenk and jackson 2002a 2005 but did not consider a role for groundwater particularly not at the scales that groundwater operates while these early meta analyses showed that roots have been observed as deep as 70 m and thus could potentially tap into groundwater in some places they often concluded that by far the majority of root biomass is shallow 2 m jackson et al 1996 schenk jackson 2002a other studies suggest that roots respond dynamically and plastically to their local soil environment hodge 2004 chen et al 2004 for example where vegetation relies solely on recent precipitation roots can sense soil moisture and grow as deep as rainfall infiltrates cannon 1911 rundel nobel 1991 similarly others have shown that roots can sense the groundwater table and follow it into deeper soils as it falls naumburg et al 2005 christina et al 2017 these considerations led to fan and collaborators developing a conceptual model for how rooting depth varies along gradients in groundwater depth fan 2015 fan et al 2017 fig 4 like much of fan s work the hillslope is the key spatial unit to organize rooting depth patterns according to fan s model rooting depth balances a trade off between the costs of constructing and maintaining roots and the benefits of deep water access bloom et al 1985 potkay et al 2021 both of which depend on hillslope position in permanently water logged floodplains and valleys position 1 in fig 4 and at slightly higher elevations where water logging occurs seasonally position 2 roots are shallow to avoid asphyxiation ascending the hillslope to where rainfall infiltration meets groundwater s capillary rise position 3 soils are moist between the surface down to the groundwater table and roots grow deeper at yet higher elevations position 4 a small dry gap exists between the rainfall infiltration depth and the groundwater table and dimorphic roots grow down to the groundwater table finally at well drained uplands position 5 the dry gap between the rainfall infiltration depth and the groundwater table becomes too large for roots to access groundwater and roots are shallow and grow only as deep as precipitation infiltrates to test her conceptual model for rooting depth fig 4 fan et al 2017 compiled thousands of observations of rooting depth recording groundwater depth from more than 1 000 species from six continents additionally they developed a novel approach to inverse model rooting depth from esm predicted soil moisture profiles based on the idea that most root water uptake will occur in the wettest soil layers by analogy to ohm s law resembling the rooting profiles that optimize an organism s evolutionary fitness to compete survive and reproduce laio et al 2006 collins bras 2007 schymanski et al 2008 2009 potkay et al 2021 their extensive data synthesis supported their conceptual model fan 2015 fan et al 2017 in addition to showing large plasticity in rooting responses to local environment within genera and plant growth forms these observations clearly showed that the groundwater table represented the lower boundary for root growth even when up to 100 m deep when their roots grow down to the groundwater table or its capillary fringe plants directly connect the atmosphere to groundwater potentially even groundwater 100 m deep thereby creating opportunities for deep groundwater to influence climate and weather q2 compared to precipitation and soil texture which earlier works emphasized as drivers of rooting depth schenk and jackson 2002a 2005 groundwater better explained the variation in rooting depth within genera fan et al 2017 similarly their inverse modeled rooting depth agreed well with the compiled observations demonstrating that rooting depth varied fundamentally at the hillslope scale fan et al 2017 miguez macho fan 2021 hence fan s conceptual model can explain the large variations in rooting depths observed under the same climate soil texture genera and plant growth form as the product of their distinct topographic positions fan has established the hillslope as the spatial scale that dominates rooting depth signals from which have blossomed new questions about rooting depth for example it remains unclear whether plants adapt their rooting depths to their soil and topographic environments over their individual lifetimes or over many generations through evolution early studies do not clearly suggest such a timescale jackson et al 1996 canadell et al 1996 and some recent studies emphasize that a strong phylogenetic control on roots has evolved over many generations valverde barrantes et al 2017 mccormack et al 2020 knighton et al 2021 though see tumber dávila et al 2022 conversely fan and collaborators fan et al 2017 potkay et al 2021 have advocated that rooting depth is actively regulated over individuals lifetimes within physiological constraints such fast acclimation is prerequisite for fan s model fig 4 to explain intraspecific variation in rooting depth with groundwater access 4 conclusion though groundwater goes unseen hidden underground we celebrate the scholarship and scientific contributions of ying fan for bringing groundwater up into the light demonstrating its global impact in natural processes typically studied by different scientific fields e g meteorology ecology landscape evolution weathering through deep synthesis of scientific literature excavation of forgotten and hidden data and insights and creative global scale modeling of fundamental mechanisms

2515,hydrogeologists are trained to think about belowground processes and their importance is apparent to them other scientific disciplines have traditionally emphasized processes that occur on or above earth s surface and thus groundwater s roles sometimes go unnoticed in studies of weather climate and plant diversity and traits among others over her career ying fan has persistently

separate instances of fan s tangible eagerness to inspect the roots of trees overturned by recent storms gleefully confirming this or that insight about which she had read not long before we also recall fan being a remarkably supportive educator and mentor to which her exceptional kindness empathy and patience testify thus her enthusiasm is a testimony not only to her directly scientific contributions but also to the generation of scientists that she has inspired fan has asked simple yet profound questions throughout her career which we arrange in two sections in our review notably including a continental to global scale hydrology 11 how deep is groundwater 21 where when and how does groundwater affect land atmosphere fluxes and thus weather and climate b groundwater s impact on vegetation 31 where and when is groundwater crucial to support vegetation and to explain vegetation distributions 41 how deep do roots grow or more specifically do roots grow down to the groundwater table and if so where here we review the key research contributions of ying fan and her collaborators addressing these important science questions q1 q4 fig 2 summarizes fan s career over the last 15 years including her key works and their research themes first we review the insights that fan together with her colleagues and mentees have contributed in response to the first two questions q1 q2 as they both relate to groundwater s global impact on climate this also includes fan s insights on how to incorporate this in modeling hydrology in esms then we review the latter two questions q3 q4 as they relate to groundwater s ecohydrological controls on plant biodiversity and physiology this division between the former and latter two sets of questions however is merely done heuristically to guide this review in reality climate hydrology and vegetation are tightly coupled as demonstrated in fan s work over the last 15 years further demonstrated by fan s regular alternation between closely related research themes fig 2 though we do not focus here on fan s earlier work we note that it foreshadows many of the themes that would persist throughout her career including the spatial heterogeneity of finely resolved hydrologic processes fan duffy 1993 expanding them to catchment scales and beyond fan bras 1995 fan et al 1996 and mechanistic modeling of hydrologic processes fan et al 1997 fan bras 1998 moramarco et al 1999 2 a continental to global scale hydrology bridging the gap between the local scales at which hydrological processes are often studied and the globe has long been recognized as a major challenge e g eagleson 1986 fan and collaborators recognized the nuances of scale that underlies our guiding questions q1 q4 krakauer et al 2014 and have sought to address these questions at the hillslope catchment regional continental and global scales fan recognized the lack of attempts to either synthesize observations of groundwater depth across the globe or simulate groundwater depth globally while some earlier work had implicitly represented groundwater in large scale modeling e g koster et al 2000 ducharne et al 2000 walko et al 2000 chen kumar 2001 seuffert et al 2002 gedney cox 2003 yang niu 2003 niu yang 2003 using the topmodel framework beven kirkby 1979 esms typically do not represent the storage and flow of water in deep soils and rock groundwater surface water interactions the dynamics of the groundwater table and the topographic resolution required to simulate the lateral convergence of runoff and groundwater from drier hilltops and ridges into wetter valleys fan 2015 clark et al 2015 fan et al 2019 instead esms often simulate the subsurface hydrologic processes over a shallow soil column typically only a few meters deep that drains freely at the bottom this drainage is then instantly routed with surface runoff into the ocean unavailable to propagate upward or laterally based on gradients in hydraulic pressure moisten dry soils from below and supply evapotranspiration and streamflow to address our first two questions q1 q2 fan meticulously synthesized groundwater observations fan et al 2013 and together with several collaborators implemented simple yet elegant groundwater and surface hydrology in an esm breaking from the norm fan and collaborators explicitly represented realistic hydrologic mechanisms in their esm by accounting for the physics that describe the movement of water between lakes rivers soils the atmosphere and most exceptionally groundwater miguez macho et al 2007 by developing a large scale model that considers virtually all of the paths for water in the hydrologic cycle whether surficial subterranean or atmospheric fan and collaborators synthesized and unified surface and subsurface hydrology and meteorology they later introduced a novel floodplain scheme that allowed subsurface and surface waters to interact miguez macho fan 2012a in which groundwater particularly upland drainage could supply water to streams and floodplains depleting groundwater stores in the process they focused first on north america as a test bed for continental scale hydrological modeling fan et al 2007 miguez macho et al 2007 anyah et al 2008 miguez macho fan 2008 fan miguez macho 2011 and then to amazonia miguez macho fan 2012a b pokhrel et al 2013 before extending the model to the entire globe fan et al 2013 notably fan s effort to model the complex hydrology of amazonia was a major breakthrough because although amazonian surface water had been well studied e g coe et al 2002 yamazaki et al 2011 2012 the coupling of groundwater and surface water in amazonia had not previously been explicitly modeled their physics based model capable of describing the numerous paths for water in the hydrologic cycle especially those associated with groundwater proved to be robust having been validated against measurements of groundwater depth fan et al 2007 fan et al 2011 2013 miguez macho fan 2012a soil moisture miguez macho et al 2007 2008 miguez macho fan 2012b streamflow miguez macho et al 2007 miguez macho fan 2012a precipitation anyah et al 2008 evapotranspiration miguez macho fan 2012b wetland distribution fan miguez macho 2011 2013 seasonal flooding miguez macho fan 2012a and satellite based estimates of terrestrial water storage pokhrel et al 2013 2 1 q1 how deep is groundwater from their global groundwater modeling and synthesis of literature and data fan and collaborators addressed q1 by demonstrating that shallow groundwater 5 m is common globally fig 3 regardless of climate or local precipitation fan et al 2007 miguez macho et al 2007 miguez macho fan 2012b fan miguez macho 2010 2013 groundwater is shallow among humid climates but it may also be shallow in valleys across the globe where groundwater and surface water descend by gravity from uplands into valleys that is climate predominantly drives groundwater depth at regional scales while topography is the dominant control of groundwater depth at hillslope and catchment scales fan miguez macho 2013 fan et al 2015 hence regardless of regional climate topography redistributes moisture through lateral groundwater and stream flows across hillslope and catchment scales maintaining valley soils that are moister than their adjacent upland soils 2 2 q2 where and when does groundwater affect weather and climate the topographic redistribution of moisture results in a mosaic of wet valley soils and dry upland soils this heterogeneity in soil moisture is known to have profound impacts on regional meteorology avissar pielke 1989 chen avissar 1994 mahrt 2000 huang margulis 2009 altering the spatial distribution of evapotranspiration precipitation and heat fluxes thus the same modeling approach by fan and collaborators also addresses q2 they showed that where evapotranspiration is regionally water limited i e drier climates the convergence of water towards valleys locally alleviates such water limitations enhancing evapotranspiration in valleys and contributing to the local water balance there fan et al 2007 miguez macho et al 2007 miguez macho fan 2012b fan miguez macho 2010 2013 wetlands and desert oases are examples of this convergence fan miguez macho 2011 miguez macho fan 2012a fan 2015 fan et al 2019 in fact wetlands are typically identified by the presence of high soil moisture without consideration of the source of this moisture often implicitly assuming precipitation as the source contrarily fan s model demonstrated large swathes of stable coastal wetlands are supported by groundwater convergence towards sea level the boundary condition for groundwater along the coast fan miguez macho 2011 miguez macho fan 2012a accordingly on one hand shallow groundwater is often apparent at large scales in humid climates fan et al 2007 fan et al 2013 fig 3 while on the other hand the inclusion of groundwater in their esm had the largest impact on simulated evapotranspiration in drier climates by wetting valley soils from below miguez macho et al 2007 anyah et al 2008 similarly schaller and fan 2009 demonstrated that the contribution of groundwater to stream flow is typically greatest in arid climates where stream discharge often exceeds the difference between precipitation and evapotranspiration and thus where groundwater must be imported to support perennial streams hence groundwater affects climate across the globe and exerts its strongest control on weather and climate in valleys of arid regions especially where elevations are low and thus where groundwater is shallow in addition to how groundwater continually exports water from uplands to lowlands and thus decouples soil moisture and evapotranspiration spatially from regional precipitation patterns groundwater and soil moisture are temporally decoupled from precipitation events groundwater levels often track rain events with a delay though often they do not respond to small rain events eltahir yeh 1999 weider boutt 2010 and the response of groundwater levels in lowlands to rain events lags the upland response by many years decades centuries and even millennium tóth 1963 bethke johnson 2008 schaller fan 2009 cuthbert ashley 2014 this temporal decoupling between precipitation and groundwater is the result of two major lags fan et al 2015 first there exists a lag between the local groundwater rise and precipitation due to the time for precipitation to infiltrate surface soils and percolate down to the groundwater table as well as due to other dynamic groundwater losses a second lag exists due to the continual albeit slow lateral flow of groundwater from hilltops to valleys which supplies valleys with groundwater from hilltops long after a rain event and causes the valley groundwater rise to peak later than the peak in the hilltop these lags are not so easily separable in actuality and we separate them heuristically for example the lateral groundwater flow from uplands to lowlands associated with the second lag further lengthens first lag the time for local groundwater to rise in uplands by continually losing upland groundwater further dampening the upland groundwater response to precipitation hence groundwater acts as an important buffer stabilizing the temporal variations in soil moisture especially in lowlands which are continually supplied by upland groundwater reserves even long after a rain event fan and collaborators demonstrated that these groundwater dynamics indeed maintain moist soils and support evapotranspiration rates in lowland valleys long after the last rain event such as during dry seasons miguez macho et al 2007 miguez macho fan 2012a b pokhrel et al 2014 fan et al 2019 all in all groundwater affects weather and climate most during dry seasons and groundwater will become increasingly important as droughts intensify and become more frequent in the future pokhrel et al 2014 notably these roles of groundwater on weather and climate are dependent on whether groundwater is shallow enough to impact the moisture of surface soils and evapotranspiration leading to the question of how shallow must groundwater be to impact surface hydrologic processes fan explored this line of thought first by analyzing the capillary rise of groundwater miguez macho et al 2008 and later by redirecting her focus to the questions of how deep do roots grow and can roots access deep groundwater q4 we review fan s insights on roots and groundwater access later in section b 2 3 modeling global hydrology given fan s deep understanding of how climate systems work and groundwater s impact on climate across scales fan has strongly advocated for improving the representation of groundwater in esms proposing and demonstrating the feasibility of mechanistic computationally efficient approaches to model hydrological processes at large scales fan 2015 clark et al 2015 fan et al 2019 indeed interests and efforts to represent hydrological processes lateral groundwater and runoff convergence in esms and other large scale models has surged in the past decade clark et al 2015 fan et al 2019 felfelani et al 2021 including representing deep water storage in rock fractures e g hartmann et al 2015 2017 vrettas fung 2017 2015 any modeling effort to represent groundwater however is constrained by the limited amount of data on soil and rock hydraulic properties with depth e g bedrock depth porosity conductivity fan et al 2015 clark et al 2015 fan et al 2019 to circumvent this challenge for esms fan and collaborators proposed empirical modeling the hydraulic conductivity of surface soils from soil texture classes clapp hornberger 1978 derived from digital soil maps unesco food and agriculture organization https www fao org nr land soils digital soil map of the world en statsgo https soildatamart nrcs usda gov sdmdb gsmfull htm fan et al 2013 additionally they employed the concept that conductivity exponentially declines with depth beven kirkby 1979 reflecting the increasing overburden pressures on geologic materials with depth e g terzaghi 1925 and weathering processes to estimate the conductivity of deep soils and rock in their model given that the weathering sedimentation balance depends strongly on terrain slope hooke 2000 fan and collaborators proposed to formulate the rate at which conductivity declines exponentially with depth as a function of topographic slope fan et al 2007 this approach has since been adopted in continental scale modeling studies e g gleeson et al 2016 martinez et al 2016 maxwell condon 2016 zhang et al 2016 though being an effective first order approximation this approach greatly simplifies the complex roles of geology climate and biology on the vertical distribution of the properties of geologic materials fan et al 2015 2019 proposed that this approach could be improved by integrating global lithological maps of geologic provinces and rock types hartmann moosdorf 2012 as well as global estimates of permeability based on rock types gleeson et al 2011 2014 huscroft et al 2018 in fact to fill the gap of limited data on hydraulic properties fan et al 2015 proposed an action plan to develop an interdisciplinary global data infrastructure where the geoscientists could contribute register access and visualize data of earth s upper crust referred to as the digitalcrust fan envisioned that this digitalcrust would accommodate the structure and physical chemical and biological properties of the upper crust in both space and time assimilating observational data and interpretations from all available sources including geologic maps cross sections and structural contours hydrogeologic unit delineations soil tests slug tests aquifer pump tests and indirect property estimates obtained through model inversions realistically modeling hydrology in esms is also computationally challenging because representing the hillslope processes that govern flow especially surface flow requires relatively fine spatial resolutions e g krakauer et al 2014 making long term simulations computationally expensive esms were originally designed to run on grid cell sizes 100 km fan 2015 pokhrel et al 2016 that are too coarse to resolve hillslope and catchment scale hydrologic processes while some have argued that recent computational advances allow esms to be solved at hyperresolutions that can resolve such fine scale hydrologic processes wood et al 2011 others disagree beven et al 2015 arguing that hyperresolution may further increase model bias due to the uncertainty of the additional parameterizations required at such fine resolution fan et al 2019 proposed a reasonable alternative to represent hillslope and catchment scales processes within esm grid cells to avoid the additional uncertainties owing from hyperresolutions while improving computational efficiency specifically they expanded on the practice of dividing grid cells into multiple individually modeled equivalent or representative hillslopes hazenberg et al 2015 ajami et al 2016 an approach that has already been introduced and applied in esms milly et al 2014 subin et al 2014 chaney et al 2018 fan et al 2019 advanced this approach by proposing to subdivide each hillslope by the grid cell s internal distribution of height above the nearest drainage hand nobre et al 2011 rather than by the typically used elevation e g nijssen et al 1997 hand represents a location s ability to drain and has the advantage of being correlated with groundwater depth soil moisture and soil texture nobre et al 2011 as well as floristic compositions schietti et al 2014 simplifying parameterization of hydrologic properties along the representative hillslope this approach means that grid cell heterogeneity may be represented by a single slope hand is a useful tool for representing spatial heterogeneity within hydrologic models cuartas et al 2012 and has recently been used to subdivide esm grid cells and improve river routing chaney et al 2021 3 b groundwater s impact on vegetation large scale patterns in precipitation have long been known to drive broad patterns in plant diversity e g mutke barthlott 2005 kreft jetz 2007 historically without consideration of finer scale drivers such as valley to hilltop soil moisture and groundwater depth gradients similarly early meta analyses on rooting depth canadell et al 1996 jackson et al 1996 schenk and jackson 2002a 2005 emphasized large scale regional characteristics like soil texture vegetation type or biome and large scale climate patterns e g precipitation potential evapotranspiration as drivers of rooting depth diverging from these large scale controls the work by fan and collaborators has advanced hillslope scale patterns of groundwater access as a fundamental driver of plant diversity and rooting depth at much finer scales than were previously considered here we focus on how fan and collaborators addressed q3 q4 3 1 q3 where and when does groundwater support vegetation through global groundwater modeling and synthesis of literature fan and collaborators have demonstrated where and when groundwater supports plants water demands over large scale regional patterns in climate fan and collaborators have shown that groundwater supports the transpiration of plants in arid and semiarid regions humid regions of low relief e g wetlands fan miguez macho 2011 miguez macho fan 2012a and wherever seasonal water status greatly varies between a plentiful wet season and a pronounced dry season e g eastern amazonia mediterranean type climates especially where topographic relief is moderate to high fan 2015 fan et al 2019 groundwater s impact on transpiration in arid and semiarid regions is predominantly restricted to valleys miguez macho fan 2021 where groundwater is shallow and where roots can tap into it fan et al 2017 desert oases are poignant examples of such groundwater dependent arid valleys fan 2015 fan et al 2019 interestingly in both arid and humid climates the vast majority of groundwater that plants transpire is not sourced by local precipitation but instead is sourced in uplands before converging in valleys and lowlands miguez macho fan 2021 hence answering the question of where and when groundwater supports plants transpiration requires analysis at the fine spatial scales at which groundwater affects the water balance especially through substantial lateral flow krakauer et al 2014 highlighting the importance of hillslope and catchment scales in explaining larger scale patterns of plant water use similar to when groundwater affects climate q2 fan and collaborators have demonstrated that groundwater s role in supporting vegetation s water demands is strongest in the dry season miguez macho et al 2007 miguez macho fan 2012a b pokhrel et al 2014 miguez macho fan 2021 and weakest in the wet season when plants preferentially uptake recent precipitation plants greater dependence on groundwater in the dry season partially results from the lag in time between recharge in uplands and lowlands discussed above q2 which temporally decouples local soil moisture from regional precipitation and which supplies additional groundwater during the dry season to valleys improving vegetation resilience pokhrel et al 2013 2014 fan 2015 the greater dependence during the dry season also results from how roots uptake soil water when soil water is heterogeneously distributed with depth roots preferentially uptake water from wettest soil layers with the smallest hydraulic resistances in a manner analogous to electrical circuit connected in parallel fan et al 2017 mackay et al 2020 potkay et al 2021 soil root resistances typically increase with depth due to longer flow paths and because root densities tend to decline with depth jackson et al 1996 schenk jackson 2002a this increase in soil root resistance with depth suggests that roots uptake deep soil water only when surface soils are desiccated and lose conductivity thus during the wet season precipitation wets the ground surface and roots preferentially uptake water from wetter upper soil layers where hydraulic resistances are smallest conversely during the dry season surface soils become depleted of moisture and plants must rely on deep soil water e g groundwater s capillary fringe despite longer flow paths and smaller root densities these spatiotemporal controls of groundwater on transpiration suggest that groundwater can explain patterns in plant diversity where precipitation cannot fan miguez macho 2011 2013 fan 2015 species segregate along fine scale soil moisture gradients silvertown et al 1999 2015 and valley to ridge hillslope position e g schietti et al 2014 suggesting the species have strong affiliations for particular positions along gradients of groundwater depth and its temporal variability similarly plant traits vary intraspecifically along gradients in soil moisture alder et al 1996 and groundwater depth zolfaghar et al 2015 accordingly fan 2015 has hypothesized groundwater as an ecological niche differentiator the role of which is expected to be greatest where plants rely least on recent precipitation and thus where water is distantly sourced and travels through the subsurface for plants to access e g desert oases wetlands by accounting for groundwater this hydrologic niche separation implicitly reflects the complex interplay of geology topography and climate while the common use of precipitation and potential evapotranspiration to explain patterns in plant diversity e g mutke barthlott 2005 kreft jetz 2007 reflects only large scale climate to demonstrate groundwater s global role as a hydrologic niche differentiator fan et al 2019 enumerated examples from across the globe of hydrologic niche separation at hillslope scales that cannot be explained by precipitation alone such as the transition from open savannah on hilltops to rainforests in the eastern congo indeed interest in groundwater as a hydrologic niche differentiator has recently surged e g cosme et al 2017 mclaughlin et al 2017 2020 brum et al 2019 oliveira et al 2019 2021 costa et al 2022 including simulations of plant vulnerability to changing climates through mechanistic models of coupled groundwater and plant physiology e g tai et al 2018 2021 love et al 2019 mackay et al 2020 fan et al 2019 later extended the notion of groundwater as a niche differentiator by examining an additional mechanism by which groundwater may influence species distributions besides water availability per se in particular groundwater controls bedrock weathering rempe dietrich 2014 and thus also nutrient availability clayton 1979 according to which plants indeed segregate e g peñuelas et al 2008 hence groundwater differentiates niches according to both water and nutrient availability while groundwater may impede chemical weathering e g ruxton berry 1959 thomas 1966 where weathering reactions reach equilibrium faster than groundwater can flow away fan 2015 proposed that groundwater incentivizes roots to grow deeper at least where groundwater is deep see below thereby accelerating weathering in some places by physically widening rock fractures nijland et al 2010 schwinning 2013 and increasing the acidity of soils and groundwater maeght et al 2013 richter billings 2015 this root spurred weathering may increase local nutrient availability if groundwater convergence is slow and elsewhere quickly converging groundwater carries recently released nutrients downhill weintraub et al 2017 shi et al 2018 concentrating them in valleys fan 2015 and collaborators boyce et al 2017 theorized that this nexus between groundwater roots weathering and nutrients is key to how terrestrial plants radiated from coasts and river valleys into the continents during the silurian and devonian geologic periods forever changing the earth s land atmosphere and oceans since e g retallack 1997 algeo scheckler 1998 berner 2005 3 2 q4 how deep do roots grow for plants to benefit from groundwater q3 and for deep groundwater to impact weather and climate q2 plants first need to grow roots deep enough to access groundwater this consideration naturally motivated fan s efforts to address the fourth question q4 how deep do roots grow further do roots grow down to the groundwater table if so where early meta analyses showed that rooting depth varies with soil texture vegetation type or biome and large scale climate patterns canadell et al 1996 jackson et al 1996 schenk and jackson 2002a 2005 but did not consider a role for groundwater particularly not at the scales that groundwater operates while these early meta analyses showed that roots have been observed as deep as 70 m and thus could potentially tap into groundwater in some places they often concluded that by far the majority of root biomass is shallow 2 m jackson et al 1996 schenk jackson 2002a other studies suggest that roots respond dynamically and plastically to their local soil environment hodge 2004 chen et al 2004 for example where vegetation relies solely on recent precipitation roots can sense soil moisture and grow as deep as rainfall infiltrates cannon 1911 rundel nobel 1991 similarly others have shown that roots can sense the groundwater table and follow it into deeper soils as it falls naumburg et al 2005 christina et al 2017 these considerations led to fan and collaborators developing a conceptual model for how rooting depth varies along gradients in groundwater depth fan 2015 fan et al 2017 fig 4 like much of fan s work the hillslope is the key spatial unit to organize rooting depth patterns according to fan s model rooting depth balances a trade off between the costs of constructing and maintaining roots and the benefits of deep water access bloom et al 1985 potkay et al 2021 both of which depend on hillslope position in permanently water logged floodplains and valleys position 1 in fig 4 and at slightly higher elevations where water logging occurs seasonally position 2 roots are shallow to avoid asphyxiation ascending the hillslope to where rainfall infiltration meets groundwater s capillary rise position 3 soils are moist between the surface down to the groundwater table and roots grow deeper at yet higher elevations position 4 a small dry gap exists between the rainfall infiltration depth and the groundwater table and dimorphic roots grow down to the groundwater table finally at well drained uplands position 5 the dry gap between the rainfall infiltration depth and the groundwater table becomes too large for roots to access groundwater and roots are shallow and grow only as deep as precipitation infiltrates to test her conceptual model for rooting depth fig 4 fan et al 2017 compiled thousands of observations of rooting depth recording groundwater depth from more than 1 000 species from six continents additionally they developed a novel approach to inverse model rooting depth from esm predicted soil moisture profiles based on the idea that most root water uptake will occur in the wettest soil layers by analogy to ohm s law resembling the rooting profiles that optimize an organism s evolutionary fitness to compete survive and reproduce laio et al 2006 collins bras 2007 schymanski et al 2008 2009 potkay et al 2021 their extensive data synthesis supported their conceptual model fan 2015 fan et al 2017 in addition to showing large plasticity in rooting responses to local environment within genera and plant growth forms these observations clearly showed that the groundwater table represented the lower boundary for root growth even when up to 100 m deep when their roots grow down to the groundwater table or its capillary fringe plants directly connect the atmosphere to groundwater potentially even groundwater 100 m deep thereby creating opportunities for deep groundwater to influence climate and weather q2 compared to precipitation and soil texture which earlier works emphasized as drivers of rooting depth schenk and jackson 2002a 2005 groundwater better explained the variation in rooting depth within genera fan et al 2017 similarly their inverse modeled rooting depth agreed well with the compiled observations demonstrating that rooting depth varied fundamentally at the hillslope scale fan et al 2017 miguez macho fan 2021 hence fan s conceptual model can explain the large variations in rooting depths observed under the same climate soil texture genera and plant growth form as the product of their distinct topographic positions fan has established the hillslope as the spatial scale that dominates rooting depth signals from which have blossomed new questions about rooting depth for example it remains unclear whether plants adapt their rooting depths to their soil and topographic environments over their individual lifetimes or over many generations through evolution early studies do not clearly suggest such a timescale jackson et al 1996 canadell et al 1996 and some recent studies emphasize that a strong phylogenetic control on roots has evolved over many generations valverde barrantes et al 2017 mccormack et al 2020 knighton et al 2021 though see tumber dávila et al 2022 conversely fan and collaborators fan et al 2017 potkay et al 2021 have advocated that rooting depth is actively regulated over individuals lifetimes within physiological constraints such fast acclimation is prerequisite for fan s model fig 4 to explain intraspecific variation in rooting depth with groundwater access 4 conclusion though groundwater goes unseen hidden underground we celebrate the scholarship and scientific contributions of ying fan for bringing groundwater up into the light demonstrating its global impact in natural processes typically studied by different scientific fields e g meteorology ecology landscape evolution weathering through deep synthesis of scientific literature excavation of forgotten and hidden data and insights and creative global scale modeling of fundamental mechanisms fan and her collaborators have shown that groundwater may be shallow across the globe contributing to weather and climate and that its gradients at hillslope scales are first order drivers of vegetation biodiversity and rooting depth her contributions are reflected in the current zeitgeist of developing and testing groundwater and surface water mechanisms in esms our few crystal balls to divine our future climate fan s overarching contributions highlight that hydrology is not just a scientific discipline to itself but also a paradigm to interpret numerous terrestrial processes

2516,long term high precision and spatiotemporal observation of current structure in small scale waters is important for underwater research and water resources management in this paper a reciprocal sound transmission experiment was conducted using three coastal acoustic tomography cat systems within 300 m spacing in huangcai reservoir hunan china from 14 to 16 sep 2020 the multi arrival reciprocal paths between each pair of stations were identified with the help of ray simulation 3 d cat data which penetrated the full depth of water were obtained the flow field along vertical slice were mapped and showed consistency with acoustic doppler current profiler adcp and temperature depth td data a standard deviation of 0 73 m s at the bottom layer were observed indicating strong bottom flows in the reservoir furthermore to visualize the strong bottom flow the horizontal flow fields in the bottom layer were mapped by 3 d inversion technique the feasibility of the technique was validated by three measures 1 comparison between range average current and horizontal flow field 2 uncertainty analysis 3 check net volume transport this work proves the cat combined with 3 d inversion technique has the potentials to provide real time 3 d current data for water researches keywords coastal acoustic tomography small scale 3 d multi layer flow filed inverse problem data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction flow velocity as one of the most fundamental data in hydrological and environmental parameters plays a vital role in water resource management ecosystem service management and underwater research thomas et al 2020 the most direct and effective method is on site observation survey and remote sensing acoustic doppler current profiler adcp is considered as a widely accepted instrumentation for resolving current structure hydrodynamometer that deployed in flowing buoy and subsurface fixed buoy is also used for current measurement meanwhile remote sensing with satellite and radar offers another choice for water parameter sensing elyouncha et al 2021 flow velocity measurements over small spatial scales have recently gained growing recognition in underwater exploration kaneko et al 2020 huang et al 2019a razaz et al 2015 vanthof et al 2019 for instance the hydrodynamic characteristics of waters in ports waterways lakes reservoirs and artificial upwelling areas are closely related to hydrological environment liu et al 2018 abrantes et al 2018 huang et al 2019b these small scale waters usually require higher observation resolution to provide detailed imaging information about the hydrological spatial structure obtaining detailed spatiotemporal of flow filed over small spatial scales in shallow waters is of great importance for underwater physics chemistry and ecology wang et al 2018 huettel et al 2014 mcmillan et al 2017 the commonly used method e g adcp cannot realize 2 d or 3 d synchronous observation of an area for a long time although over small spatial scales in hundreds of meters and deploying adcp anchor array or shipborne adcp sailing observation to obtain a large range of flow field is costly the efficiency of hydrodynamometer is also relatively low on the other hand the busy shipping and frequent fishing activities will greatly interfere with the anchor system layout and navigation operations it is hard to use these conventional observation methods to conduct a long term and regional observation which limits the development of related researches zhu et al 2013 remote sensing with satellite and radar can only get surface information as high frequency electromagnetic wave cannot propagate long distance in water therefore new observation technique is needed for flow filed sensing over small spatial scales differential travel time obtained by reciprocal transmission of acoustic signals between transducers is used to calculate range average current rac along sound path section munk et al 1995 ocean acoustic tomography oat an advanced remote sensing technology proposed by munk and wunsch is used to observe mesoscale ocean dynamic characteristics munk et al 1979 flow dynamic information and water parameters in a large area can be sensed remotely using this multi station underwater acoustic sensing network coastal acoustic tomography cat developed from oat by kaneko et al in 1994 has been widely used for underwater flow dynamic progress sensing due to the advantages of low cost compact design easy operating instrument and fast on board execution underwater information can be obtained continuously using cat technology compared with previous cat researches researchers paid more attention to the 2 d flow field and focused on time varying tidal current mapping in ports bays straits and inland seas syamsudin et al 2019 taniguchi et al 2020 zhu et al 2017 zhang et al 2014 since 2010 the fluvial acoustic tomography fat system similar to cat application was proposed kawanisi et al 2010 to even shallower waters for measuring the river flow in vertical 2 d vertical flow filed as given by syamsudin et al 2017 inverted vertical velocity profiling was accomplished by the defined two arrival peaks of sound transmissions with two cat stations zhu et al 2017 performed vector plots of currents achieved by cat assimilation with a triangular mesh their scheme not only fitted the complex coastlines well but also described variation in vertical layers however as zhu et al described it is impossible for inversion to reconstruct the vertical circulation structure with only acquisition of reciprocal sound transmission at depth of the transceivers thus even if the variation in vertical layers can be described with cat estimation with a triangular mesh there is obviously a strong projection correlation between layers in recent years cat technology has gradually developed from 2 d to 3 d observation it is necessary to explain the difference between them 2 d observation along horizontal slice concerns more on the direct arrival path between different stations thus it can hardly obtain the information out of the transceiver s depth furthermore the acoustic rays near the bottom may be blocked by underwater hillsides which makes it difficult to observe bottom flow field by simply deploying transceiver at the bottom on the other hand the 2 d observation along vertical slice focuses on multiple arrival paths between two cat stations therefore it is easier to be realized because only two stations are considered although previous studies have analyzed 2 d flow field and achieved referable results it is also a major limitation of these studies as they were unable to get 3 d sound transmission data the 3 d data means the identified sound transmission could penetrate and cover the whole observation environment along both vertical and horizontal slices the 3 d inversion technique has been proposed by kaneko et al in 2020 but field applications of cat 3 d flow field measurement techniques is blank the realization of 3 d observation requires not only horizontal direct paths information but also multiple paths along the vertical slices between each pair of stations this puts forward higher demands for data qualities and multi arrival path identification methods herein this research is optimizing the availability and acceptability of 3 d inversion technology in small scale cat observation in the reciprocal sound transmission experiment 3 d data were successfully obtained and a strong bottom flow event in the reservoir is captured which is unattainable by traditional 2 d method the subsurface mooring multi peak identification and extraction method and iterative inversion method are proposed to successfully apply the 3 d inversion technology to the small scale cat flow field observation 2 methods 2 1 rac calculation the rac and sound speed can be directly calculated by reciprocal travel time these two values can display average characteristics of the observed region and also as a reference to verify the inversion accuracy the diagram of reciprocal sound transmission between s1 and s2 is shown in fig 1 the flow velocity v directed from s1 to s2 is taken to be positive v c is the velocity component in the direction of flow the travel time from s1 to s2 t and s2 to s1 t can be expressed by sound speed c along the ray path and flow velocity v 1 t γ ds c v l c v m 2 t γ ds c v l c v m where v m and l are rac and the ray length projected onto the horizontal plane respectively after subtraction and summation of eqs 1 and 2 we obtain 3 v m l 2 1 t 1 1 t 2 l 2 t 0 2 δ t c 0 2 2 l δ t where t t t 0 2 and t 0 l c 0 c 0 represents reference sound speed δ t t t is differential travel time the transducer position deviation would affect the estimations of differential travel times worcester et al 1977 the error of rac can be expressed as 4 δ v m vm δ l l δ δ t δ t from the eq 4 the small deviations of position and differential travel time δ l and δ δ t respectively are transferred to the small velocity deviations δ v m the precise clock signals with accuracy of 0 6 μs are provided by gps clock used in the cat system during this experiment which can ensure the synchronization of time between each station for l 0 2 km and δ l 1 m coming from global positioning system gps positioning errors δ l l 0 005 and δv 0 005v m showing that positioning error is not an important factor of flow velocity measurement therefore small drifting of transducer position only slightly affects velocity observation when the time synchronization of each station is accurate 2 2 3 d flow field technique presented here is 3 d inversion technique kaneko et al 2020 applied for mapping multi layer flow field in small scale shallow waters horizontally as shown in fig 2 three projected rays connect three omnidirectional transducers on a horizontal slice for jth layer and the vertical slice along ith ray is segmented into three horizontal layers two step inversion is performed including vertical slice and horizontal slice inversion where the latter uses the racs calculated by the former one in each layer the inverted results in different layers along horizontal slices can describe the spatiotemporal flow field structure 2 2 1 flow field construction along vertical slice a requirement for vertical construction is to observe multiple arrivals in received signals as demonstrated in fig 3 a vertical slice is divided into three layers between s1 and s2 the flow velocity for layers are unknown variables to be solved in the vertical inversion vj is rac in jth layer directed from s1 to s2 taken to be positive travel times from s1 to s2 t i and s2 to s1 t i along ray1 ray2 and ray3 are calculated by the following equations 5 l 11 c 01 δ c 1 v 1 l 12 c 02 δ c 2 v 2 t 1 l 22 c 02 δ c 2 v 2 t 2 l 32 c 02 δ c 2 v 2 l 33 c 03 δ c 3 v 3 t 3 where l ij represents the length of iray i 1 2 3 passing jth layer j 1 2 3 c 0 j and δ c j reference sound speed and range average sound speed deviation in jth layer respectively taking the taylor expansion under c 0 δ c j and neglecting the second and higher order terms we obtain 6 2 l 11 c 01 2 2 l 12 c 02 2 δ t 1 2 l 22 c 02 2 v 2 δ t 2 2 l 32 c 02 2 v 2 2 l 33 c 03 2 v 3 δ t 3 where δ t i t i t i represents the reciprocal differential travel time of iray note that δ c j is eliminated during the calculation so the sound speed fluctuation has little influence on flow velocity result the above relations for reference travel time and reference sound speed can be written in the matrix form syamsudin et al 2017 7 δ t 1 δ t 2 δ t 3 2 l 11 c 01 2 l 12 c 02 2 0 0 l 22 c 02 2 0 0 l 32 c 02 2 l 33 c 03 2 v 1 v 2 v 3 eq 7 is rewritten as below 8 y e x n y δ t i x v j n n j e l ij c 0 j 2 the regularization is used to calculate racs on three layers 2 2 2 flow field construction along horizontal slice based on vertical slice inversions racs along the projected rays can be provided from multi vertical slice inversions and served as input data for horizontal slice inversions the stream function theory is used to construct horizontal flow field considering factors as ray paths and temperature changes the propagation path of acoustic ray is shown in fig 4 which is representative but not the real acoustic rays in this experiment the differential travel time of n path s1 s2 s1 s3 s2 s3 can be written as 9 δ t n 2 0 l n v h cos ϕ i c 0 2 d ξ cos ϕ i 2 0 l n v h c 0 2 d ξ where ξ is the ray path projected along the horizontal plane ϕ is the angle between velocity direction along the propagation path and the tangent direction of real ray path v h can be decomposed into east and north velocity components where v h u cos θ i v sin θ i and θ i represents the angle between the horizontal velocity and east direction the 2 d horizontal flow field can be expressed as the fourier expansion of stream function park et al 2001 10 ψ x y a x b y k 0 nx l 0 ny a k l cos 2 π kx l x ly l y b k l sin 2 π kx l x ly l y m 1 n x 1 n y 1 d m q m x y where d d m a b a 00 b 00 a 01 b 01 a n x n y b n x n y are coefficients to be solved q x y q

between east and north components of the flow velocity can be expressed as 11 u ψ y v ψ x substituting eq 10 11 into eq 9 we can get razaz et al 2015 12 δ t n 2 c 0 2 m 1 n x 1 n y 1 d m 0 l n q m y cos θ m q m x sin θ i d ξ the rac of jth layer calculated by vertical inversion can be used for obtaining the differential travel time of horizontal flow field as shown in fig 4 b three projected rays connect three stations on a horizontal slice in jth layer and the vertical slice along n path corresponding to path s1 s2 in this case is segmented into three horizontal layers then combining eq 3 and eq 12 we obtain 13 v j 1 l n m 1 n x 1 n y 1 d m 0 l n q m y cos θ i q m x sin θ i d ξ where vj represents rac of jth layer ln represents the distance of n path s1 s2 s1 s3 s2 s3 by solving eq 7 the rac of each path in each layer can be obtained which is substituted into eq 13 to map the multi layer horizontal flow field by tapered least square method yamoaka et al 2002 whereafter obtaining spatiotemporal flow field on account of 3 d inversion technique an iterative method shown in the fig 5 is used to improve inversion accuracy by setting threshold of inversion error it is necessary to continuously optimize the ray simulation processes multipath identification and extraction to improve accuracy of flow field 3 site and experiment setup the experiment was carried out in huangcai reservoir hunan china on september 14 16 2020 the experiment site is shown in fig 6 huangcai reservoir is a large water conservancy project mainly for irrigation with comprehensive benefits of power generation flood control and aquaculture this reservoir connects with two rivers which brings water input the terrain is lower than that before construction satellite imagery illustrated that the height of its surface is about 40 m 50 m lower than that of the nearby river the east part of huangcai reservoir is magnified in the right panel illustrating three cat stations s1 s2 s3 and temperature depth sensors td cast location in the orange black circles and orange red star symbol respectively td was used to measure temperature profiling and depth of experiment site the white solid line is the transmission path of the sound line projected onto a horizontal plane the adcp was fixed on the side of a moving ship with a customized fixator shown in the upper right corner of fig 6 to measure the velocity and the bottom topography between each pair of stations during the sailing adcp was connected to the bow and stern of a moving ship to ensure that it would not deviate due to current resistance utilizing the travel time of direct paths and corresponding temperature obtained from td sensors station to station distances were calculated as shown in table 1 considering bottom reflected rays the 10th order m sequences were selected to ensure simultaneous transmission and improve signal to noise ratio snr for small scale cat observation as shown in fig 7 the cat system comprises a cat system controller power on land 50 khz subsurface omnidirectional transducer cables in water and global positioning system ann ms 0 005 gps antennas the major parameters are displayed in table 2 the cat system controller of s1 s2 s3 were laid on three fishing boats at anchored all stations were equipped with high time accuracy gps less than 0 6 μs error to synchronize the clock timing during transmission reception and ad conversion omnidirectional transducers with 50 khz central frequency were equipped with each station and were fixed at the depth of about 20 m as displayed in the fig 8 a subsurface mooring method was adopted that bottom additional weights and subsurface float balls were added in each transducer to prevent position drift it is analyzed from obtained acoustic travel time that this method controlled the position of transducers at a drift of no more than 7 cm before deploying five td sensors a pre survey with one td sensor was conducted to obtain the temperature depth profile and the points of temperature deflection were identified for arrangement of td sensors five td sensors were arranged in a vertical profile fig 8 a the top two td sensors were deployed in the surface layer to obtain surface temperature change under sunlight the third and fourth td sensors in the middle were arranged between 7 and 30 m to determine the temperature changes at two inflection points the last td sensor was laid at a depth of 32 m and was designed to measure temperature changes on the bottom of observed area the salinity in this freshwater reservoir can be ignored consequently the sound speed profile corresponding to temperature profile can be obtained as demonstrated in fig 8 b the surface temperature was 27 32 c and remained constant upper 10 m with depth increasing the temperature decreased linearly with depth from 10 to 27 m then there was an inflection point after which temperature decreased significantly 4 results and discussion 4 1 ray simulation the more acoustic rays are collected the more time information will be available thereby obtaining more accurate observation results thus the multipath identification of acoustic rays are the base of vertical slice inversion and the key to map 3 d flow field the difficulty lies in finding arrival peaks of bottom reflected rays and extracting them accurately due to the large energy loss the process to obtain observed travel times includes ray simulation and peak identification from cross correlation results ray simulations were performed using bottom topography and reference sound speed profile determined from td data it is worth mentioning that there were many identifiable correlation peaks in the cross correlation patterns of this experiment but these correlation peaks cannot completely match the ray simulation results therefore the iterative method was proposed for analyzing the inversion error of different ray simulation schemes to continuously optimize the ray simulation processes multipath identification and extraction and the following shows the final results after multiple iterations in this simulation scheme all the acoustic rays with more than one interaction with the bottom were thrown out rays were launched from source 16 20 m below the surface with angles ranging from 45 to 45 with an increment of 0 005 at receiver with a diameter of 0 4 m the length variation of two adjacent ray paths under 0 01 stride 0 0043 0 0063 m smaller than 0 06 m can be identified accurately simulated acoustic ray paths for s1 s2 s1 s3 and s2 s3 are shown in fig 9 b c and d respectively the three rays with different ray patterns were obtained which were 1 direct rays with red lines d 2 surface reflected rays with black lines sr and 3 bottom reflected rays with green lines br respectively the orange curve was the bottom topography calculated from shipborne adcp data in bottom tracking mode because of significant signal loss the snr of arrival peaks with more than one bottom reflection was too low to be identified according to temperature profiling the vertical velocity field was divided into three layers layer 1 0 15 m layer 2 15 25 m and layer 3 25 m to the bottom besides the launch angle of rays and its corresponding length were diagramed in fig 9 e f and g by calculating travel times of rays across each layer the reference travel time of each ray can be determined the lengths of acoustic rays d sr br passing through each layer under three paths s1 s2 s1 s3 s2 s3 are shown in table 3 tl and tt are the total length and the travel time respectively the depth range of each layer corresponding reference temperature and reference sound speed are shown in table 4 the data in table 4 were calculated from the temperature profile measured by td 4 2 observed travel times the correlation results of received signals between s1 and s2 are shown with stack diagrams in fig 10 a and c the snr was defined as the ratio of the peak height to the mean height of the received data in this work i e the magnitude of a point divided by the average amplitude in the time window which makes the comparison and arrival peaks identification more convenient corresponding to ray simulation mentioned above there were three types of significant arrival peaks the red black and green circles represent the peaks of d rays sr rays and br rays respectively the peaks of sr rays were the largest arrival peaks and d rays were lower than sr rays fig 10 b and d are color maps corresponding to correlation results of received signals between s1 and s2 the mean snrs of d rays reached 10 db for s1 s2 and 9 db for s2 s1 respectively it is investigated that the annual sediment inflow of huangcai reservoir is about 39 800 tons which mainly comes from rainstorm erosion in addition red argillaceous siltstone and mudstone with fine particles and good permeability are widely distributed in reservoir bottom in this geological circumstance the attenuation of each interaction of sound line is large fig 11 a b and c show an example of reciprocal arrival patterns for paths s1 s2 s1 s3 s2 s3 at one time respectively three distinctive arrival peaks were identified in each arrival pattern along three paths these arrival peaks can be grouped as three pairs of reciprocal arrivals 1st peaks 2nd peaks and 3rd peaks over transmission time these three arrival peaks correspond to different sound transmission paths during arrival peak identification the main point is the selection of time window the multi arrival peaks were identified using time windows calculated by reference time of each ray displayed in table 5 firstly most snr threshold were set to 2 conservatively so that useful information can be collected as much as possible in subsequent process the travel time would be further filtered to eliminate outliers fig 11 a demonstrated that position of peaks between sr rays and br rays was quite close to avoid the mutual influence of these two peaks and improve the identification performance the first two points with the highest snr were directly extracted with a larger time window after multi peak identification the corresponding differential travel time was obtained the time plots of differential travel time for three paths s1 s2 s1 s3 and s2 s3 are shown in fig 12 the black curve is the 10 min moving average results it is worth noting that there was a stable error between s1 system and other systems in laboratory tests before the inversion we use sufficient measurement data to take the average value for correcting the time error 4 3 vertical flow field and discussion in this section we firstly introduced the shipboard adcp measurement to collect terrain and flow velocity data after calculating the vertical flow field by inversion the results fig 14 are compared with the td sensors fig 15 and adcp fig 16 measurement data objectively which verify that the bottom flow is independent large and a careful check for vertical inversion fig 17 is further performed during cat observation shipboard adcp 600 khz rowe technologies inc was performed for 20 mins the profiling broadband range and bottom track range of the adcp are 50 m and 120 m respectively the adcp was placed at the depth of 0 5 m underwater and the sampling was performed every 1 s for a total 20 bin number each with a bin size of 2 m given that the voyage route of the shipboard adcp was not exactly along the preset path we projected the original flow velocity profile measured by adcp to the preset path horizontal transmission lines of s1 s2 s1 s3 and s2 s3 the results of navigation path and corresponding flow velocity profile are shown in fig 13 a and b adcp started from s1 and ran along the path of s1 s2 s3 s1 simultaneously by applying the bottom tracking mode topography data were obtained in each sampling there was almost no flow on surface while a large flow was observed in the bottom layer it is reported that the reservoir has a confluence of 240 8 square kilometers more than 1 2 million mu of water surface and a storage capacity of 147 million cubic meters the huangcai reservoir basin has a mild climate abundant rainfall and obvious dry and wet conditions the average annual rainfall in the basin is 1461 3 mm and the runoff of the reservoir is mainly formed by rainfall with an average annual runoff of 183 million cubic meters on continuous rainy days it is known that the accumulated rainfall during the observation period exceeds 50 mm h the reconstructed multi layer flow fields along vertical slice for all station pairs are shown in fig 14 the red and blue lines indicate the original velocity data and 10 min moving average results ma respectively the sd shown in the upper right of each panel is the standard deviation indicating that flow velocity in layer 3 was more significantly fluctuant than that in upper two layers in addition fig 14 illustrated that flow velocity of layer 3 was larger than upper two layers which was consistent with the adcp data in fig 13 the obvious bottom fluctuation observed by cat was consistent with the measured data of td sensors fig 15 showed the depth and temperature measurements of td sensors and it can be referred to fig 8 a for the layout of five td sensors it can be divided into four periods according to the changes of depth firstly fig 15 a manifested that there was a similar trend in the depth change of five td sensors during period 1 the depth of each td decreased slowly over time in period 2 the water depth of five td sensors fluctuated slightly then as rain augmented soon after period 3 the water level rose rapidly where the depth of five td sensors also decreased rapidly in period 4 the water level rose and its rising speed was gradually slower the total change of depth from period 3 to period 4 was about 20 cm which was mainly caused by the continuous rain during the field survey in fig 15 b the temperature at the depth of five td sensors changed significantly over time the deployed depths of td1 and td2 were close to the surface thus their temperature fluctuation trends were almost the same the change of td3 in period 2 and period 3 was similar to that of td1 and td2 but there was an obvious difference in period 4 noted that there were significant temperature fluctuations at the depth of td4 and td5 and the temperature tendency of td4 and td5 have no correlation with the above three td sensors the above phenomenon can be descirbed as during periods 1 2 the temperature of td4 and td5 fluctuated continuously and had no obvious regularity in period 3 after the heavy rain the water temperature at the depths of td1 2 and 3 began fluctuating significantly then accelerated to decline finally reached the lowest point at the end of period 3 during this period the temperature fluctuation at the depths of td4 and td5 gradually increased and finally decreased with time it would be reasonable to speculate that the rapid flow and its mixing process were the main causes of temperature change fig 16 shows the comparison of flow field measured by adcp and cat results for three paths s1 s2 s1 s3 and s2 s3 the bold black lines thin red lines and blue lines represent adcp measurement inversion and moving average results respectively the adcp data is layer average on the sampling points during the approximate time and the dotted circles are enlarged views the sound signal was transmitted at internals every 1 min from each transducer of cat system while the sampling rate of shipborne adcp was 1 hz the instantaneous comparison between cat and adcp results can hardly be performed because of different sampling rates thus adcp average data was compared with rac it is demonstrated that the inversion results of three paths are in agreement with adcp results the uncertainty of velocity along vertical slices for three paths s1 s2 s1 s3 and s2 s3 was performed in fig 17 it was demonstrated that uncertainties of flow velocity at upper two layers for the three vertical slices were about 0 005 m s and the maximum error at the bottom layer for s1 s2 and s2 s3 was about 0 021 m s and 0 028 m s respectively while that for s1 s3 is nearly exceeding 0 1 m s 4 4 horizontal flow field and discussion from the adcp data td data and reconstructed vertical profile we found that there were strong bottom flows in the reservoir therefore further investigation of the flow fields along horizontal slice at the bottom was needed however the existing researches and methods mainly studied the horizontal 2 d flow field at transducer depth or only obtain depth averaged velocity profile which can hardly meet requirements in this experiment in this study with reliable vertical inversion results along three transmission paths the multi layer horizontal flow field namely the 3 d flow field can be mapped snapshots of horizontal velocity distributions near bottom at different times are presented in fig 18 the bottom flow mainly followed the watercourse of s1 s3 path and it changed gradually during the observation period the comparison results of rac for three paths before and after horizontal inversion in layer 3 are presented in fig 19 the red curve represents the projection of horizontal flow field inversion on the path and the blue curve represents rac of each path in layer 3 before horizontal inversion the rmses of s1 s2 s1 s3 s2 s3 were 0 29 m s 0 19 m s and 0 15 m s respectively as displayed in fig 19 the differences between inversion and calculation of s1 s2 were relatively high since the correctness of rac for each path has been discussed in section 4 3 after comparing rac as shown in fig 19 it can be preliminarily proved that the bottom 2 d flow field is reliable it is worth noting that the accuracy of cat data also can be further validated by the balance of net volume transport the net volume transport was calculated from the cross section average velocity perpendicular to the transmission path s1 s2 s1 s3 and s2 s3 along the horizontal slice the flow rate of three paths s1 s2 s1 s3 and s2 s3 in the bottom layer over time are shown in the fig 20 the inflow was set to be positive whereas the outflow was negative as displayed in the fig 20 the light blue line is the summation of flow rate ranging from 0 0404 m s to 0 0189 m s the near zero volume transport shows the equivalence of transportation between the inflow and outflow which proves the validity of observation results 5 conclusion this research is optimizing the availability and acceptability of 3 d inversion technology in small scale cat observation and the bottom flow phenomenon in the reservoir is captured unattainable with the use of traditional 2 d flow field observation here an array of cat systems was deployed in huangcai reservoir to map small scale spatiotemporal flow field along horizontal slice where the station to station distances range from 224 m to 284 m reciprocal acoustic signals were transmitted simultaneously between each pair of stations the subsurface mooring multi peak identification and iterative inversion method are proposed to successfully apply the 3 d inversion technology to the small scale cat flow field observation by field experiment 3 d sound transmission data were successfully obtained and the bottom flow phenomenon was observed authors also follow previous cat studies for this validation the existence of strong bottom flow was verified through indirect inversion error balance of volume transport td sensors data and uncertainty check and direct adcp data approaches it was proved that the iteration method could obtain reasonable inversion results decreasing the error of solving the two step inversion problem in 3 d technology the adcp data and corresponding inversion results showed good consistencies the rmses between rac and the horizontal flow field along transmission line at the bottom layer were 0 29 m s 0 19 m s and 0 15 m s respectively the total net volume transport was nearly equal to zero showing a balance of volume transport between the inflow and outflow the uncertainty of the inversion results was further performed to illuminate that the inversion errors are within reasonable bounds however it should be noted that the above validation is still not sufficient enough to describe the performance of the 3 d inversion technique due to the following reasons 1 the adcp data are not collected in a long term for instance several hours data therefore only a few data can be compared 2 only three stations are used in this experiment so the acoustic rays cannot cover the whole observation environment however this is quite important for an accurate 3 d inversion the number of acoustic rays will be doubled if one more station is used 3 we are lack of further validation data such as rate of flow in near outfalls we can hardly give a further validation of strong bottom flow by only limited adcp and td data part of the reasons is that the strong bottom current is an unexpected event consequently further data validation is required in the future this research as an effective tool provides a practical method of applying 3 d inversion technology and cat more reasonably to short range stereo observation in reservoir river and such small scale water areas it broadens the application range of cat in short range observation to the author s knowledge it is the first successful application of 3 d technology in cat reported so far

2516,long term high precision and spatiotemporal observation of current structure in small scale waters is important for underwater research and water resources management in this paper a reciprocal sound transmission experiment was conducted using three coastal acoustic tomography cat systems within 300 m spacing in huangcai reservoir hunan china from 14 to 16 sep 2020 the multi arrival reciprocal paths between each pair of stations were identified with the help of ray simulation 3 d cat data which penetrated the full depth of water were obtained the flow field along vertical slice were mapped and showed consistency with acoustic doppler current profiler adcp and temperature depth td data a standard deviation of 0 73 m s at the bottom layer were observed indicating strong bottom flows in the reservoir furthermore to visualize the strong bottom flow the horizontal flow fields in the bottom layer were mapped by 3 d inversion technique the feasibility of the technique was validated by three measures 1 comparison between range average current and horizontal flow field 2 uncertainty analysis 3 check net volume transport this work proves the cat combined with 3 d inversion technique has the potentials to provide real time 3 d current data for water researches keywords coastal acoustic tomography small scale 3 d multi layer flow filed inverse problem data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction flow velocity as one of the most fundamental data in hydrological and environmental parameters plays a vital role in water resource management ecosystem service management and underwater research thomas et al 2020 the most direct and effective method is on site observation survey and remote sensing acoustic doppler current profiler adcp is considered as a widely accepted instrumentation for resolving current structure hydrodynamometer that deployed in flowing buoy and subsurface fixed buoy is also used for current measurement meanwhile remote sensing with satellite and radar offers another choice for water parameter sensing elyouncha et al 2021 flow velocity measurements over small spatial scales have recently gained growing recognition in underwater exploration kaneko et al 2020 huang et al 2019a razaz et al 2015 vanthof et al 2019 for instance the hydrodynamic characteristics of waters in ports waterways lakes reservoirs and artificial upwelling areas are closely related to hydrological environment liu et al 2018 abrantes et al 2018 huang et al 2019b these small scale waters usually require higher observation resolution to provide detailed imaging information about the hydrological spatial structure obtaining detailed spatiotemporal of flow filed over small spatial scales in shallow waters is of great importance for underwater physics chemistry and ecology wang et al 2018 huettel et al 2014 mcmillan et al 2017 the commonly used method e g adcp cannot realize 2 d or 3 d synchronous observation of an area for a long time although over small spatial scales in hundreds of meters and deploying adcp anchor array or shipborne adcp sailing observation to obtain a large range of flow field is costly the efficiency of hydrodynamometer is also relatively low on the other hand the busy shipping and frequent fishing activities will greatly interfere with the anchor system layout and navigation operations it is hard to use these conventional observation methods to conduct a long term and regional observation which limits the development of related researches zhu et al 2013 remote sensing with satellite and radar can only get surface information as high frequency electromagnetic wave cannot propagate long distance in water therefore new observation technique is needed for flow filed sensing over small spatial scales differential travel time obtained by reciprocal transmission of acoustic signals between transducers is used to calculate range average current rac along sound path section munk et al 1995 ocean acoustic tomography oat an advanced remote sensing technology proposed by munk and wunsch is used to observe mesoscale ocean dynamic characteristics munk et al 1979 flow dynamic information and water parameters in a large area can be sensed remotely using this multi station underwater acoustic sensing network coastal acoustic tomography cat developed from oat by kaneko et al in 1994 has been widely used for underwater flow dynamic progress sensing due to the advantages of low cost compact design easy operating instrument and fast on board execution underwater information can be obtained continuously using cat technology compared with previous cat researches researchers paid more attention to the 2 d flow field and focused on time varying tidal current mapping in ports bays straits and inland seas syamsudin et al 2019 taniguchi et al 2020 zhu et al 2017 zhang et al 2014 since 2010 the fluvial acoustic tomography fat system similar to cat application was proposed kawanisi et al 2010 to even shallower waters for measuring the river flow in vertical 2 d vertical flow filed as given by syamsudin et al 2017 inverted vertical velocity profiling was accomplished by the defined two arrival peaks of sound transmissions with two cat stations zhu et al 2017 performed vector plots of currents achieved by cat assimilation with a triangular mesh their scheme not only fitted the complex coastlines well but also described variation in vertical layers however as zhu et al described it is impossible for inversion to reconstruct the vertical circulation structure with only acquisition of reciprocal sound transmission at depth of the transceivers thus even if the variation in vertical layers can be described with cat estimation with a triangular mesh there is obviously a strong projection correlation between layers in recent years cat technology has gradually developed from 2 d to 3 d observation it is necessary to explain the difference between them 2 d observation along horizontal slice concerns more on the direct arrival path between different stations thus it can hardly obtain the information out of the transceiver s depth furthermore the acoustic rays near the bottom may be blocked by underwater hillsides which makes it difficult to observe bottom flow field by simply deploying transceiver at the bottom on the other hand the 2 d observation along vertical slice focuses on multiple arrival paths between two cat stations therefore it is easier to be realized because only two stations are considered although previous studies have analyzed 2 d flow field and achieved referable results it is also a major limitation of these studies as they were unable to get 3 d sound transmission data the 3 d data means the identified sound transmission could penetrate and cover the whole observation environment along both vertical and horizontal slices the 3 d inversion technique has been proposed by kaneko et al in 2020 but field applications of cat 3 d flow field measurement techniques is blank the realization of 3 d observation requires not only horizontal direct paths information but also multiple paths along the vertical slices between each pair of stations this puts forward higher demands for data qualities and multi arrival path identification methods herein this research is optimizing the availability and acceptability of 3 d inversion technology in small scale cat observation in the reciprocal sound transmission experiment 3 d data were successfully obtained and a strong bottom flow event in the reservoir is captured which is unattainable by traditional 2 d method the subsurface mooring multi peak identification and extraction method and iterative inversion method are proposed to successfully apply the 3 d inversion technology to the small scale cat flow field observation 2 methods 2 1 rac calculation the rac and sound speed can be directly calculated by reciprocal travel time these two values can display average characteristics of the observed region and also as a reference to verify the inversion accuracy the diagram of reciprocal sound transmission between s1 and s2 is shown in fig 1 the flow velocity v directed from s1 to s2 is taken to be positive v c is the velocity component in the direction of flow the travel time from s1 to s2 t and s2 to s1 t can be expressed by sound speed c along the ray path and flow velocity v 1 t γ ds c v l c v m 2 t γ ds c v l c v m where v m and l are rac and the ray length projected onto the horizontal plane respectively after subtraction and summation of eqs 1 and 2 we obtain 3 v m l 2 1 t 1 1 t 2 l 2 t 0 2 δ t c 0 2 2 l δ t where t t t 0 2 and t 0 l c 0 c 0 represents reference sound speed δ t t t is differential travel time the transducer position deviation would affect the estimations of differential travel times worcester et al 1977 the error of rac can be expressed as 4 δ v m vm δ l l δ δ t δ t from the eq 4 the small deviations of position and differential travel time δ l and δ δ t respectively are transferred to the small velocity deviations δ v m the precise clock signals with accuracy of 0 6 μs are provided by gps clock used in the cat system during this experiment which can ensure the synchronization of time between each station for l 0 2 km and δ l 1 m coming from global positioning system gps positioning errors δ l l 0 005 and δv 0 005v m showing that positioning error is not an important factor of flow velocity measurement therefore small drifting of transducer position only slightly affects velocity observation when the time synchronization of each station is accurate 2 2 3 d flow field technique presented here is 3 d inversion technique kaneko et al 2020 applied for mapping multi layer flow field in small scale shallow waters horizontally as shown in fig 2 three projected rays connect three omnidirectional transducers on a horizontal slice for jth layer and the vertical slice along ith ray is segmented into three horizontal layers two step inversion is performed including vertical slice and horizontal slice inversion where the latter uses the racs calculated by the former one in each layer the inverted results in different layers along horizontal slices can describe the spatiotemporal flow field structure 2 2 1 flow field construction along vertical slice a requirement for vertical construction is to observe multiple arrivals in received signals as demonstrated in fig 3 a vertical slice is divided into three layers between s1 and s2 the flow velocity for layers are unknown variables to be solved in the vertical inversion vj is rac in jth layer directed from s1 to s2 taken to be positive travel times from s1 to s2 t i and s2 to s1 t i along ray1 ray2 and ray3 are calculated by the following equations 5 l 11 c 01 δ c 1 v 1 l 12 c 02 δ c 2 v 2 t 1 l 22 c 02 δ c 2 v 2 t 2 l 32 c 02 δ c 2 v 2 l 33 c 03 δ c 3 v 3 t 3 where l ij represents the length of iray i 1 2 3 passing jth layer j 1 2 3 c 0 j and δ c j reference sound speed and range average sound speed deviation in jth layer respectively taking the taylor expansion under c 0 δ c j and neglecting the second and higher order terms we obtain 6 2 l 11 c 01 2 2 l 12 c 02 2 δ t 1 2 l 22 c 02 2 v 2 δ t 2 2 l 32 c 02 2 v 2 2 l 33 c 03 2 v 3 δ t 3 where δ t i t i t i represents the reciprocal differential travel time of iray note that δ c j is eliminated during the calculation so the sound speed fluctuation has little influence on flow velocity result the above relations for reference travel time and reference sound speed can be written in the matrix form syamsudin et al 2017 7 δ t 1 δ t 2 δ t 3 2 l 11 c 01 2 l 12 c 02 2 0 0 l 22 c 02 2 0 0 l 32 c 02 2 l 33 c 03 2 v 1 v 2 v 3 eq 7 is rewritten as below 8 y e x n y δ t i x v j n n j e l ij c 0 j 2 the regularization is used to calculate racs on three layers 2 2 2 flow field construction along horizontal slice based on vertical slice inversions racs along the projected rays can be provided from multi vertical slice inversions and served as input data for horizontal slice inversions the stream function theory is used to construct horizontal flow field considering factors as ray paths and temperature changes the propagation path of acoustic ray is shown in fig 4 which is representative but not the real acoustic rays in this experiment the differential travel time of n path s1 s2 s1 s3 s2 s3 can be written as 9 δ t n 2 0 l n v h cos ϕ i c 0 2 d ξ cos ϕ i 2 0 l n v h c 0 2 d ξ where ξ is the ray path projected along the horizontal plane ϕ is the angle between velocity direction along the propagation path and the tangent direction of real ray path v h can be decomposed into east and north velocity components where v h u cos θ i v sin θ i and θ i represents the angle between the horizontal velocity and east direction the 2 d horizontal flow field can be expressed as the fourier expansion of stream function park et al 2001 10 ψ x y a x b y k 0 nx l 0 ny a k l cos 2 π kx l x ly l y b k l sin 2 π kx l x ly l y m 1 n x 1 n y 1 d m q m x y where d d m a b a 00 b 00 a 01 b 01 a n x n y b n x n y are coefficients to be solved q x y q

between east and north components of the flow velocity can be expressed as 11 u ψ y v ψ x substituting eq 10 11 into eq 9 we can get razaz et al 2015 12 δ t n 2 c 0 2 m 1 n x 1 n y 1 d m 0 l n q m y cos θ m q m x sin θ i d ξ the rac of jth layer calculated by vertical inversion can be used for obtaining the differential travel time of horizontal flow field as shown in fig 4 b three projected rays connect three stations on a horizontal slice in jth layer and the vertical slice along n path corresponding to path s1 s2 in this case is segmented into three horizontal layers then combining eq 3 and eq 12 we obtain 13 v j 1 l n m 1 n x 1 n y 1 d m 0 l n q m y cos θ i q m x sin θ i d ξ where vj represents rac of jth layer ln represents the distance of n path s1 s2 s1 s3 s2 s3 by solving eq 7 the rac of each path in each layer can be obtained which is substituted into eq 13 to map the multi layer horizontal flow field by tapered least square method yamoaka et al 2002 whereafter obtaining spatiotemporal flow field on account of 3 d inversion technique an iterative method shown in the fig 5 is used to improve inversion accuracy by setting threshold of inversion error it is necessary to continuously optimize the ray simulation processes multipath identification and extraction to improve accuracy of flow field 3 site and experiment setup the experiment was carried out in huangcai reservoir hunan china on september 14 16 2020 the experiment site is shown in fig 6 huangcai reservoir is a large water conservancy project mainly for irrigation with comprehensive benefits of power generation flood control and aquaculture this reservoir connects with two rivers which brings water input the terrain is lower than that before construction satellite imagery illustrated that the height of its surface is about 40 m 50 m lower than that of the nearby river the east part of huangcai reservoir is magnified in the right panel illustrating three cat stations s1 s2 s3 and temperature depth sensors td cast location in the orange black circles and orange red star symbol respectively td was used to measure temperature profiling and depth of experiment site the white solid line is the transmission path of the sound line projected onto a horizontal plane the adcp was fixed on the side of a moving ship with a customized fixator shown in the upper right corner of fig 6 to measure the velocity and the bottom topography between each pair of stations during the sailing adcp was connected to the bow and stern of a moving ship to ensure that it would not deviate due to current resistance utilizing the travel time of direct paths and corresponding temperature obtained from td sensors station to station distances were calculated as shown in table 1 considering bottom reflected rays the 10th order m sequences were selected to ensure simultaneous transmission and improve signal to noise ratio snr for small scale cat observation as shown in fig 7 the cat system comprises a cat system controller power on land 50 khz subsurface omnidirectional transducer cables in water and global positioning system ann ms 0 005 gps antennas the major parameters are displayed in table 2 the cat system controller of s1 s2 s3 were laid on three fishing boats at anchored all stations were equipped with high time accuracy gps less than 0 6 μs error to synchronize the clock timing during transmission reception and ad conversion omnidirectional transducers with 50 khz central frequency were equipped with each station and were fixed at the depth of about 20 m as displayed in the fig 8 a subsurface mooring method was adopted that bottom additional weights and subsurface float balls were added in each transducer to prevent position drift it is analyzed from obtained acoustic travel time that this method controlled the position of transducers at a drift of no more than 7 cm before deploying five td sensors a pre survey with one td sensor was conducted to obtain the temperature depth profile and the points of temperature deflection were identified for arrangement of td sensors five td sensors were arranged in a vertical profile fig 8 a the top two td sensors were deployed in the surface layer to obtain surface temperature change under sunlight the third and fourth td sensors in the middle were arranged between 7 and 30 m to determine the temperature changes at two inflection points the last td sensor was laid at a depth of 32 m and was designed to measure temperature changes on the bottom of observed area the salinity in this freshwater reservoir can be ignored consequently the sound speed profile corresponding to temperature profile can be obtained as demonstrated in fig 8 b the surface temperature was 27 32 c and remained constant upper 10 m with depth increasing the temperature decreased linearly with depth from 10 to 27 m then there was an inflection point after which temperature decreased significantly 4 results and discussion 4 1 ray simulation the more acoustic rays are collected the more time information will be available thereby obtaining more accurate observation results thus the multipath identification of acoustic rays are the base of vertical slice inversion and the key to map 3 d flow field the difficulty lies in finding arrival peaks of bottom reflected rays and extracting them accurately due to the large energy loss the process to obtain observed travel times includes ray simulation and peak identification from cross correlation results ray simulations were performed using bottom topography and reference sound speed profile determined from td data it is worth mentioning that there were many identifiable correlation peaks in the cross correlation patterns of this experiment but these correlation peaks cannot completely match the ray simulation results therefore the iterative method was proposed for analyzing the inversion error of different ray simulation schemes to continuously optimize the ray simulation processes multipath identification and extraction and the following shows the final results after multiple iterations in this simulation scheme all the acoustic rays with more than one interaction with the bottom were thrown out rays were launched from source 16 20 m below the surface with angles ranging from 45 to 45 with an increment of 0 005 at receiver with a diameter of 0 4 m the length variation of two adjacent ray paths under 0 01 stride 0 0043 0 0063 m smaller than 0 06 m can be identified accurately simulated acoustic ray paths for s1 s2 s1 s3 and s2 s3 are shown in fig 9 b c and d respectively the three rays with different ray patterns were obtained which were 1 direct rays with red lines d 2 surface reflected rays with black lines sr and 3 bottom reflected rays with green lines br respectively the orange curve was the bottom topography calculated from shipborne adcp data in bottom tracking mode because of significant signal loss the snr of arrival peaks with more than one bottom reflection was too low to be identified according to temperature profiling the vertical velocity field was divided into three layers layer 1 0 15 m layer 2 15 25 m and layer 3 25 m to the bottom besides the launch angle of rays and its corresponding length were diagramed in fig 9 e f and g by calculating travel times of rays across each layer the reference travel time of each ray can be determined the lengths of acoustic rays d sr br passing through each layer under three paths s1 s2 s1 s3 s2 s3 are shown in table 3 tl and tt are the total length and the travel time respectively the depth range of each layer corresponding reference temperature and reference sound speed are shown in table 4 the data in table 4 were calculated from the temperature profile measured by td 4 2 observed travel times the correlation results of received signals between s1 and s2 are shown with stack diagrams in fig 10 a and c the snr was defined as the ratio of the peak height to the mean height of the received data in this work i e the magnitude of a point divided by the average amplitude in the time window which makes the comparison and arrival peaks identification more convenient corresponding to ray simulation mentioned above there were three types of significant arrival peaks the red black and green circles represent the peaks of d rays sr rays and br rays respectively the peaks of sr rays were the largest arrival peaks and d rays were lower than sr rays fig 10 b and d are color maps corresponding to correlation results of received signals between s1 and s2 the mean snrs of d rays reached 10 db for s1 s2 and 9 db for s2 s1 respectively it is investigated that the annual sediment inflow of huangcai reservoir is about 39 800 tons which mainly comes from rainstorm erosion in addition red argillaceous siltstone and mudstone with fine particles and good permeability are widely distributed in reservoir bottom in this geological circumstance the attenuation of each interaction of sound line is large fig 11 a b and c show an example of reciprocal arrival patterns for paths s1 s2 s1 s3 s2 s3 at one time respectively three distinctive arrival peaks were identified in each arrival pattern along three paths these arrival peaks can be grouped as three pairs of reciprocal arrivals 1st peaks 2nd peaks and 3rd peaks over transmission time these three arrival peaks correspond to different sound transmission paths during arrival peak identification the main point is the selection of time window the multi arrival peaks were identified using time windows calculated by reference time of each ray displayed in table 5 firstly most snr threshold were set to 2 conservatively so that useful information can be collected as much as possible in subsequent process the travel time would be further filtered to eliminate outliers fig 11 a demonstrated that position of peaks between sr rays and br rays was quite close to avoid the mutual influence of these two peaks and improve the identification performance the first two points with the highest snr were directly extracted with a larger time window after multi peak identification the corresponding differential travel time was obtained the time plots of differential travel time for three paths s1 s2 s1 s3 and s2 s3 are shown in fig 12 the black curve is the 10 min moving average results it is worth noting that there was a stable error between s1 system and other systems in laboratory tests before the inversion we use sufficient measurement data to take the average value for correcting the time error 4 3 vertical flow field and discussion in this section we firstly introduced the shipboard adcp measurement to collect terrain and flow velocity data after calculating the vertical flow field by inversion the results fig 14 are compared with the td sensors fig 15 and adcp fig 16 measurement data objectively which verify that the bottom flow is independent large and a careful check for vertical inversion fig 17 is further performed during cat observation shipboard adcp 600 khz rowe technologies inc was performed for 20 mins the profiling broadband range and bottom track range of the adcp are 50 m and 120 m respectively the adcp was placed at the depth of 0 5 m underwater and the sampling was performed every 1 s for a total 20 bin number each with a bin size of 2 m given that the voyage route of the shipboard adcp was not exactly along the preset path we projected the original flow velocity profile measured by adcp to the preset path horizontal transmission lines of s1 s2 s1 s3 and s2 s3 the results of navigation path and corresponding flow velocity profile are shown in fig 13 a and b adcp started from s1 and ran along the path of s1 s2 s3 s1 simultaneously by applying the bottom tracking mode topography data were obtained in each sampling there was almost no flow on surface while a large flow was observed in the bottom layer it is reported that the reservoir has a confluence of 240 8 square kilometers more than 1 2 million mu of water surface and a storage capacity of 147 million cubic meters the huangcai reservoir basin has a mild climate abundant rainfall and obvious dry and wet conditions the average annual rainfall in the basin is 1461 3 mm and the runoff of the reservoir is mainly formed by rainfall with an average annual runoff of 183 million cubic meters on continuous rainy days it is known that the accumulated rainfall during the observation period exceeds 50 mm h the reconstructed multi layer flow fields along vertical slice for all station pairs are shown in fig 14 the red and blue lines indicate the original velocity data and 10 min moving average results ma respectively the sd shown in the upper right of each panel is the standard deviation indicating that flow velocity in layer 3 was more significantly fluctuant than that in upper two layers in addition fig 14 illustrated that flow velocity of layer 3 was larger than upper two layers which was consistent with the adcp data in fig 13 the obvious bottom fluctuation observed by cat was consistent with the measured data of td sensors fig 15 showed the depth and temperature measurements of td sensors and it can be referred to fig 8 a for the layout of five td sensors it can be divided into four periods according to the changes of depth firstly fig 15 a manifested that there was a similar trend in the depth change of five td sensors during period 1 the depth of each td decreased slowly over time in period 2 the water depth of five td sensors fluctuated slightly then as rain augmented soon after period 3 the water level rose rapidly where the depth of five td sensors also decreased rapidly in period 4 the water level rose and its rising speed was gradually slower the total change of depth from period 3 to period 4 was about 20 cm which was mainly caused by the continuous rain during the field survey in fig 15 b the temperature at the depth of five td sensors changed significantly over time the deployed depths of td1 and td2 were close to the surface thus their temperature fluctuation trends were almost the same the change of td3 in period 2 and period 3 was similar to that of td1 and td2 but there was an obvious difference in period 4 noted that there were significant temperature fluctuations at the depth of td4 and td5 and the temperature tendency of td4 and td5 have no correlation with the above three td sensors the above phenomenon can be descirbed as during periods 1 2 the temperature of td4 and td5 fluctuated continuously and had no obvious regularity in period 3 after the heavy rain the water temperature at the depths of td1 2 and 3 began fluctuating significantly then accelerated to decline finally reached the lowest point at the end of period 3 during this period the temperature fluctuation at the depths of td4 and td5 gradually increased and finally decreased with time it would be reasonable to speculate that the rapid flow and its mixing process were the main causes of temperature change fig 16 shows the comparison of flow field measured by adcp and cat results for three paths s1 s2 s1 s3 and s2 s3 the bold black lines thin red lines and blue lines represent adcp measurement inversion and moving average results respectively the adcp data is layer average on the sampling points during the approximate time and the dotted circles are enlarged views the sound signal was transmitted at internals every 1 min from each transducer of cat system while the sampling rate of shipborne adcp was 1 hz the instantaneous comparison between cat and adcp results can hardly be performed because of different sampling rates thus adcp average data was compared with rac it is demonstrated that the inversion results of three paths are in agreement with adcp results the uncertainty of velocity along vertical slices for three paths s1 s2 s1 s3 and s2 s3 was performed in fig 17 it was demonstrated that uncertainties of flow velocity at upper two layers for the three vertical slices were about 0 005 m s and the maximum error at the bottom layer for s1 s2 and s2 s3 was about 0 021 m s and 0 028 m s respectively while that for s1 s3 is nearly exceeding 0 1 m s 4 4 horizontal flow field and discussion from the adcp data td data and reconstructed vertical profile we found that there were strong bottom flows in the reservoir therefore further investigation of the flow fields along horizontal slice at the bottom was needed however the existing researches and methods mainly studied the horizontal 2 d flow field at transducer depth or only obtain depth averaged velocity profile which can hardly meet requirements in this experiment in this study with reliable vertical inversion results along three transmission paths the multi layer horizontal flow field namely the 3 d flow field can be mapped snapshots of horizontal velocity distributions near bottom at different times are presented in fig 18 the bottom flow mainly followed the watercourse of s1 s3 path and it changed gradually during the observation period the comparison results of rac for three paths before and after horizontal inversion in layer 3 are presented in fig 19 the red curve represents the projection of horizontal flow field inversion on the path and the blue curve represents rac of each path in layer 3 before horizontal inversion the rmses of s1 s2 s1 s3 s2 s3 were 0 29 m s 0 19 m s and 0 15 m s respectively as displayed in fig 19 the differences between inversion and calculation of s1 s2 were relatively high since the correctness of rac for each path has been discussed in section 4 3 after comparing rac as shown in fig 19 it can be preliminarily proved that the bottom 2 d flow field is reliable it is worth noting that the accuracy of cat data also can be further validated by the balance of net volume transport the net volume transport was calculated from the cross section average velocity perpendicular to the transmission path s1 s2 s1 s3 and s2 s3 along the horizontal slice the flow rate of three paths s1 s2 s1 s3 and s2 s3 in the bottom layer over time are shown in the fig 20 the inflow was set to be positive whereas the outflow was negative as displayed in the fig 20 the light blue line is the summation of flow rate ranging from 0 0404 m s to 0 0189 m s the near zero volume transport shows the equivalence of transportation between the inflow and outflow which proves the validity of observation results 5 conclusion this research is optimizing the availability and acceptability of 3 d inversion technology in small scale cat observation and the bottom flow phenomenon in the reservoir is captured unattainable with the use of traditional 2 d flow field observation here an array of cat systems was deployed in huangcai reservoir to map small scale spatiotemporal flow field along horizontal slice where the station to station distances range from 224 m to 284 m reciprocal acoustic signals were transmitted simultaneously between each pair of stations the subsurface mooring multi peak identification and iterative inversion method are proposed to successfully apply the 3 d inversion technology to the small scale cat flow field observation by field experiment 3 d sound transmission data were successfully obtained and the bottom flow phenomenon was observed authors also follow previous cat studies for this validation the existence of strong bottom flow was verified through indirect inversion error balance of volume transport td sensors data and uncertainty check and direct adcp data approaches it was proved that the iteration method could obtain reasonable inversion results decreasing the error of solving the two step inversion problem in 3 d technology the adcp data and corresponding inversion results showed good consistencies the rmses between rac and the horizontal flow field along transmission line at the bottom layer were 0 29 m s 0 19 m s and 0 15 m s respectively the total net volume transport was nearly equal to zero showing a balance of volume transport between the inflow and outflow the uncertainty of the inversion results was further performed to illuminate that the inversion errors are within reasonable bounds however it should be noted that the above validation is still not sufficient enough to describe the performance of the 3 d inversion technique due to the following reasons 1 the adcp data are not collected in a long term for instance several hours data therefore only a few data can be compared 2 only three stations are used in this experiment so the acoustic rays cannot cover the whole observation environment however this is quite important for an accurate 3 d inversion the number of acoustic rays will be doubled if one more station is used 3 we are lack of further validation data such as rate of flow in near outfalls we can hardly give a further validation of strong bottom flow by only limited adcp and td data part of the reasons is that the strong bottom current is an unexpected event consequently further data validation is required in the future this research as an effective tool provides a practical method of applying 3 d inversion technology and cat more reasonably to short range stereo observation in reservoir river and such small scale water areas it broadens the application range of cat in short range observation to the author s knowledge it is the first successful application of 3 d technology in cat reported so far

2517,nearly two thirds of fossil fuel fired electricity generation capacity in the united states is expected to reach its typical end of life by 2035 while the closure of fossil fuel fired power plants will help advance decarbonization goals the cessation of water use for fossil fuel fired power plant cooling the largest water user in the us will also impact the nation s water resources we assess when where and how much water will be made available upon the expected retirement of the nation s nearly one thousand fossil fuel fired power plants by combining a lifespan based model of fossil fuel fired generator retirements for the us fossil fuel fired electricity generation fleet with a national scale hydrologic model we show that annual water withdrawals and consumption of fossil fuel fired power generators will be significantly curtailed 85 and 68 reduction respectively by 2035 if these generators follow their typical retirement timeline most rivers with fossil fuel fired power plants diverting and or discharging water will have a net increase in annual streamflow after plant retirement maximum decrease of 2 maximum increase of 57 by 2050 with the most pronounced increases occurring in the summer months the retirement of fossil fuel fired power plants will lead to a large relative change 5 in streamflow at least one month per year by 2050 in 31 subbasins the retirement of power generators was shown to produce noticeable streamflow impacts up to hundreds of kilometers downstream by the retirement of the last us fossil fuel fired power generator 2 6 billion m3 of water that was once consumed by these power plants could be made available for other uses in addition to the global benefits of reduced greenhouse gas emissions the notable increases in streamflow and water availability in many us rivers due to the retirement of fossil fuel fired power plants could benefit local water users and ecosystems keywords fossil fuel fired power plants decarbonization water use streamflow water availability 1 introduction fossil fuel fired power plants will need to close or radically alter their operations for rapid decarbonization in response to climate change pfeiffer et al 2016 the white house 2021 tong et al 2019 williams et al 2021 united states fossil fuel fired power plants are aging with over 70 of capacity expected to reach a typical

more water is withdrawn in the us to produce electricity than any other economic sector dieter et al 2018 the portion of the withdrawn water not evaporated by the power plant will return to a waterbody or be held on site for reuse the fraction of water withdrawn from a waterbody that is consumed varies by power plant and is primarily related to the cooling technology used water consumption related to fossil fuel fired power plants is significantly less than withdrawals marston et al 2018 yet these power plants water consumption have important implications on water availability wang et al 2017 lee et al 2020 fossil fuel fired power plants can be a major contributor to water stress averyt et al 2011 2013 climate change and population growth will further strain already stressed watersheds brown et al 2019 accentuating the large spatially concentrated water withdrawals by fossil fuel fired power plants the impact of fossil fuel burning power plants water withdrawals and consumption is particularly pronounced in the summer de la guardia et al 2022 water withdrawals and consumption by power plants typically peaks in the summer due to higher evaporative potential and large electricity demands miara et al 2018 which often coincides with peak water use by other sectors and a low flow period for many rivers a reduction of water consumption by fossil fuel burning power plants could make water available to meet new or growing water demands or be set aside to meet environmental water needs this research combines a lifespan based model of fossil fuel fired generator retirements for the us fossil fuel fired electricity generation fleet grubert 2020b with a national scale hydrologic model to determine when where and how much water will be made available upon the expected retirement of the nearly one thousand fossil fuel fired power plants across the us that rely on water for cooling we resolved generator level annual water consumption and withdrawal records to a monthly timestep and then determined how a change in streamflow due to retirement of a fossil fuel burning power plant will impact local and downstream water availability while previous studies have assessed changes in water use by the electric sector under different scenarios e g ackerman and fisher 2013 cameron et al 2014 macknick et al 2012a macknick et al 2012b tidwell et al 2013 liu et al 2015 peer and sanders 2018 fulton and jin 2021 they do not capture the spatially and temporally important hydrologic details afforded by our coupled modeling approach we show in this study that the impact of fossil fuel fired power plants on water availability can be seen locally but also propagate downstream through the hydrologic network furthermore streamflow impacts vary significantly by subbasin month and in response to temporal climate variability which demonstrates the importance of the refined spatial and temporal resolution of our study 2 methods annual water withdrawals and consumption water source and lifespan for each fossil fuel fired generator were estimated using the model and data described in grubert 2020b which assumes fossil fuel fired generators retire upon reaching their 2018 fuel and generation technology specific average lifespan this model projects future us fossil fuel fired electricity generation and several socioenvironmental attributes emissions water use labor requirements by assuming that generators continue to operate at their 2018 output levels until they reach a typical lifespan annual freshwater withdrawals and consumption for each generator were resolved to the monthly timestep and to the eight digit hydrologic unit code huc8 or subbasin level to be used by the national scale hydrologic model that simulates the hydrologic impact of abstractions from surface water and groundwater sources at the monthly time step for each huc8 subbasin in the contiguous united states data preparation and model integration are detailed below 2 1 monthly water withdrawal and consumption estimates estimated generator level water consumption from grubert 2020b uses an annual timestep whereas the hydrologic model used in this study uses a monthly timestep we project water consumption through 2075 to include the typical lifespan of all existing fossil fuel fired generators indexed to 2018 in grubert 2020b and any currently under construction to facilitate model updates accordingly this work downscales projected 2018 2075 annual average water consumption for power plants with at least one fossil fuel fired generator operable as of 2018 to the monthly level reflecting two major dynamics that are relevant for evaluating water consumption in context namely 1 power generation seasonality and 2 evaporative water intensity seasonality our approach is necessary due to a lack ofaccurate comprehensivesubannual water use records chini and delorit 2021 the energy information administration eia which is the primary federal agency for collecting analyzing and distributing energy data has published estimated monthly water withdrawals and consumption at the boiler level since 2014 eia 2022 however these data are neither accurate nor complete for the needs of this work for 2020 eia data show zero water withdrawal for 40 and zero water consumption for 50 of the 926 plants for which we model ongoing water use as of 2020 these entries are often clearly incorrect for example with entries of zero water withdrawal for plants with nonzero water consumption despite these data discrepancies that we would expect to contribute to an overall underestimate eia estimates for water withdrawals and consumption for our modeled plant population are a factor of ten higher than our modeled estimates which are consistent with other published aggregate data for the universe of plants eia models which includes non fossil plants eia estimated 2020 thermoelectric water withdrawal is approximately five times and estimated 2020 thermoelectric water consumption is approximately five times that estimated by usgs for 2015 dieter et al 2018 potential explanations include inconsistent definitions e g reporting total cooling flow volumes inclusive of recirculation rather than withdrawals from a water body multiple counting due to complex relationships between boilers and cooling systems and misreports as such we model projected monthly water withdrawal and consumption using physical relationships contributingconsideration of seasonal generation and evaporative capacity wang et al 2017 lee et al 2020 fulton and jin 2021 we describe these dynamics and the modeling approach below data and calculations are included in this work as the supplementary data file annual generator level water consumption is assigned to us power plants that had at least one fossil fuel fired generator operable as of 2018 in the eia 860 database eia 2021a this assignment proceeds by aggregating estimated fossil fuel fired generator annual water consumption to the plant level based on the plant id field for each year between 2018 and 2075 inclusive by which point all fossil fuel fired us generators will have reached mean age on retirement for their type grubert 2020b a power plant s water withdrawals and consumption revert to zero upon retirement generators are assumed to run at modeled 2018 levels i e with modeled 2018 annual water consumption so for each year the model used in this work assigns generator level water consumption to a plant if the generator has not yet passed its modeled closure date grubert 2020b plants that had no generators with water consumption as of 2018 which were essentially all air cooled natural gas and oil fired combustion generators were discarded from this analysis removing these 2 005 plants with no 2018 modeled water consumption left 976 plants accounting for 640 gw of us 2018 fossil nameplate capacity out of a total of 840 gw power generation seasonality is incorporated to reflect that power generation is not consistent throughout the year electricity demand and thus generation is typically highest in summer then winter in the united states in part because of the major contribution of heating and cooling demand and because air conditioning summer cooling is essentially entirely electrified while winter heating is not eia 2013 as such most us electricity systems are summer peaking although we caution that decarbonization motivated electrification williams et al 2021 is expected to alter these relationships over the projection period of this study this study therefore assumes two alternatives for power generation seasonality a 2019 fleet average seasonality for steam fossil generation coal distillate fuel oil and natural gas eia 2021b and b no seasonality that is monthly generation is assigned assuming equal generation for every day steam fossil generation is bundled across fuel resources to avoid false precision seasonality for these resources is similar enough to support the coarse analysis in this study that is even historical annual generation patterns vary interannually e g due to weather and maintenance cycles and across generators e g due to variable regional contexts and expected major changes to the electricity sector suggest that past performance might not be a good predictor of future operational patterns given that generation is often higher during summer when water resources are more stressed in much of the us capturing the dynamic of higher water consumption during periods of high summer electricity demand was deemed to be sufficiently relevant for evaluating water quantity impacts that the 2019 pattern is included illustratively these two alternatives are illustrated in fig 1 with the steam coal and natural gas trends shown separately for context as with power generation seasonality evaporative water intensity seasonality can be highly variable across contexts evaporative water intensity seasonality reflects the point that higher water temperatures are associated with higher evaporative potential such that a unit of heat input to a unit of cooling water in a cold january month results in less evaporative water consumption than would occur with the same units of heat input and cooling water in a warm july our first order analysis includes two illustrative scenarios of evaporative water intensity seasonality i average evaporative seasonality as calculated using the evaporation model from diehl et al 2013 for a sample of usgs temperature sites with complete monthly data segura et al 2015 and ii the most extreme evaporative seasonality from that same sample of sites where the most extreme is defined as the seasonality at the site with the highest difference between minimum and maximum evaporative potential evaporative seasonality is calculated using diehl s model of forced evaporation from a water surface fews v3 104 diehl et al 2013 using all default parameters except natural water temperature t in degrees celsius to calculate the output metric evaporated gallons per mwh thermal condenser duty by month and on average over the course of a year due to this work s interest in the seasonality pattern rather than estimated water consumption per unit of generation because of access to plant level annual water consumption records monthly evaporation was normalized by average annual evaporation to give a monthly evaporative potential value in percent equation 1 1 evaporative p o t e n t i a l m evaporated g a l l o n s p e r m w h t h e r m a l c o n d e n s e r d u t y m evaporated g a l l o n s p e r m w h t h e r m a l c o n d e n s e r d u t y y where m is month and y is year calculated thusly the monthly evaporative potential is invariant to dry bulb wet bulb and plant characteristics as implemented in fews v3 104 under the fews v3 104 model evaporative potential is a function of the monthly natural water temperature we hold other model parameters at their default values usgs water temperature sites were taken from segura et al 2015 noting that stream water temperature data are sparse and thus difficult to obtain for sites that are directly relevant for power plant intakes here we use the 62 sites for which a full set of monthly average water temperature data were available shown in fig 2 alongside power plants with at least one fossil fuel fired generator operable as of 2018 as such the sites used for this analysis are not representative of sites supplying power plant cooling water they are however highly validated with high quality temperature records and thus considered suitable for this first order analysis average evaporative seasonality is the simple average of monthly evaporative potential equation 2 across the 62 sites for which a full set of monthly average water temperature data were available no location weighting of water temperature seasonality was attempted for this first order analysis because a meaningful weighting metric reflecting variable conditions at the power plants of interest was not available instead we assess two evaporative seasonalities within this analysis see fig s1 for a visual depiction to test sensitivity the average and the extreme seasonality profile from site 5057000 on the sheyenne river in eastern north dakota w monthly water consumption january 2018 through december 2075 at point of generation was estimated by combining power generation and evaporative seasonalities with annual estimates of water consumption as follows equation 2 where m is month and y is year 2 water c o n s u m p t i o n m water c o n s u m p t i o n y generation m generation y evaporative p o t e n t i a l m evaporative p o t e n t i a l y m generation m generation y evaporative p o t e n t i a l m evaporative p o t e n t i a l y in the equation above the combined seasonality estimate seasonal generation multiplied by seasonal evaporative potential in a given month is renormalized by the sum of the combined monthly seasonality estimates to ensure total water consumption for the year is preserved see the supplementary data file for more details fig 3 shows the four profiles two approaches to estimating generation seasonality combined with two approaches to estimating evaporative potential seasonality used in this analysis pairings of the two generation and two evaporative seasonality profiles yield four different seasonality scenarios table 1 different combinations of generation and evaporation scenarios for fossil fuel fired power plants generated very similar projected streamflow estimation at the subbasin level fig s2 considering the negligible impact of evaporation and generation scenario on streamflow estimation we used average evaporation combined with average generation throughout our analysis the evaporation and generation scenarios have no bearing on annual water withdrawal and consumption estimates of this study only the partitioning of annual water use estimates to each month 2 2 national scale hydrologic model the effects of the fossil fuel fired power plant water use scenarios on streamflow were assessed using the water supply stress index wassi hydrologic model developed by the us department of agriculture forest service caldwell et al 2012 sun et al 2011 wassi has been extensively tested through comparison to observed flows at us geological gauging sites and comparison to other models caldwell et al 2012 li et al 2020 schwalm et al 2015 sun et al 2015 the wassi model estimates monthly streamflow for each of the 2 099 huc8 subbasins in the contiguous us by computing the watershed water balance as affected by climate land use soil properties and topographical characteristics and then accumulating streamflow through the river network importantly wassi accounts for and enables assessment of streamflow impacts due to human water abstractions marston et al 2020 richter et al 2020 as our purpose is to isolate the effect of fossil fuel burning power plant retirements on streamflow we hold other water uses such as irrigation and public supply static around recent levels marston et al 2018 marston et al 2020 likewise we evaluated the effects of the retirement scenarios on streamflow using a common climate time period to isolate the effect of the scenarios from potential climate changes many regions have seen fundamental shifts in their hydrology since the start of the century barnett et al 2008 sagarika et al 2014 therefore we selected the 2001 2015 period for analysis and report the impact of plant retirements on the average monthly flow regime during that time in addition we evaluated streamflow impacts during a historically wet year 1993 dry year 1963 and recent year 2015 generator level projections of monthly water withdrawals and consumption between 2018 and 2075 were aggregated within each huc8 subbasin to match the spatial resolution of wassi our water use model accounts for the water withdrawal source e g river natural lake aquifer ocean and disposal location of return flows since they have implications on both current and future hydrologic conditions upon plant retirement when assessing streamflow impacts fossil fuel fired power plants that either withdraw from or discharge to a river or both were included among the 976 power plants analyzed in this study more than half 573 source their water directly from or discharge to a river or both while previous studies assess the effect of future power plant operations our modeling approach is unique in that it accounts for the displacement of water availability impacts to downstream subbasins through the river network 2 3 limitations for fossil fuel fired generators seasonality is driven by electricity demand and increasingly electricity demand net of generation from power plants utilizing flow resources like wind and solar rather than by resource availability for example solar power plants have a clear and inherent seasonality reflecting longer day length in the summertime eia 2021b whereas the higher historical summer generation from coal and natural gas plants is due to dispatching these resources in response to load one major implication for this study is that these generation profiles might change in response to dynamic fuel mixes e g increased solar penetration and dynamic demand e g from electrification of residential heating further these generation profiles might change in ways that vary by region due to variation in climate climate policy and other factors as such results should be interpreted with the understanding that these projected changes to water resource consumption by fossil fuel fired power plants reflect anticipated conditions absent climate policy or climate change similarly water evaporation profiles do not reflect future climatic conditions notably changing heat and humidity relationships as with the original model grubert 2020b the assumption of constant 2018 output and impacts for all future years a generator is expected to operate is intended as a coarse proxy for a counterfactual scenario without strong climate policy and other retirement forcing functions noting that the assumption of constant output over time has historically been a reasonable simplification at the fleet level grubert 2020a but likely overestimates future coal plant outputs and underestimates future natural gas plant outputs grubert 2020b even assuming history is a good predictor of the future which it might not be this study evaluates the hydrologic and water availability impacts of expected fossil fuel burning power plant retirements the assessment of replacement and new electricity generation facilities on water availability is left for future studies 3 results and discussion 3 1 impact of fossil fuel fired generators retirement on volumetric water use the 976 us fossil fuel fired power plants that we analyzed withdrew 58 4 billion m3 of water from surface water and groundwater sources in 2018 to produce 2 43 billion mwh of electricity the water withdrawals of these 976 power plants exceeded the 148 000 us public water systems 2015 water withdrawals by over 4 5 billion m3 dieter et al 2018 evaporative cooling at fossil fuel fired power plants consumed around 4 5 of the withdrawn water thus making this water unavailable for downstream use by the time the last generator reaches typical retirement age 2066 a decrease in water consumption related to evaporative cooling will make an additional 2 64 billion m3 of fresh surface water available nationwide analysis based on the retirement of fossil fuel fired generators predicts a sharp decline in water withdrawals and consumption within the next two decades and a complete cessation of water use by existing fossil fuel fired generators by the year 2066 fig 4 water withdrawals from fossil fuel fired power plants are expected to decline more quickly than water consumption nearly 64 of 2018 electricity generation and 50 of the fossil fuel fired power plants will be at retirement age between 2018 and 2035 yet these plant retirements will lead to an 85 reduction in water withdrawals from 58 4 billion m3 to 8 6 billion m3 fig 4 within the same timeframe consumptive water use of fossil fuel fired electricity generation will decrease by 68 from 2 6 billion m3 to 0 84 billion m3 the disproportionate reduction in water withdrawals compared to water consumption in the near term reflects more retirements of power plants that employ once through cooling technology which has significantly larger water withdrawals relative to consumption compared to recirculating cooling technology almost all hydrologic regions huc2 will see a faster decline in water withdrawals than water consumption by 2035 fig 5 the retirement of fossil fuel fired power plants in the missouri river region which is the hydrologic region with the largest withdrawals by volume and whose power plants largely use once through cooling systems will reduce water withdrawals by 94 by 2035 the water stressed rio grande and upper colorado will see reductions in water withdrawals and consumption greater than 85 of 2018 rates by 2035 water withdrawals by fossil fuel burning power plants in the upper and lower colorado regions will decline by a combined 238 million m3 by 2035 while seemingly a large volume of water this reduction in water withdrawals only amounts to 1 3 of the total water allocated to the upper and lower colorado region states there will be a similar decrease in water consumption 163 million m3 or 69 of the reduction in withdrawals within the colorado river region due to prevalence of recirculating cooling technology in the region regional estimates of trends in water withdrawal and consumption aggregated by huc2 hydrologic regions are shown in fig s3 3 2 impact of fossil fuel fired power plant retirements on streamflow among the 352 huc8 subbasins where fossil fuel fired power plants withdraw from and or discharge to a river these power plants withdrew more than 1 of total 2001 2015 mean annual natural streamflow in 111 subbasins and consumed more than 1 of total annual streamflow in 24 subbasins under 2018 levels of water use fig 6 a and 6d annual water withdrawals and consumption of fossil fuel fired power plants constituted more than 25 of natural streamflow in 25 and 3 subbasins respectively in this scenario surface water withdrawals in six subbasins and water consumption in two subbasins surpassed total annual natural streamflow within the subbasin under this scenario such anomalies occurred when the cooling water is withdrawn from and discharged to a reservoir for repeated use e g thomas hill lake in little chariton subbasin lake sakakawea in lake sakakawea subbasin jim bridger reservoir in bitter subbasin water is diverted from an adjacent large water body e g cape canaveral power plant diverts from the indian river near the subbasin outlet or water is transferred from a nearby subbasin to supply power plant s e g middle san juan to chaco subbasin raisin to ottawa stony subbasin the number of subbasins with more than 1 of its annual streamflow withdrawn in 2018 reduces from 111 to 50 by 2035 and to 13 by 2050 fig 6b and 6c all 352 subbasins with fossil fuel fired power plants that withdrawal from or discharge to a river will experience changes to streamflow due to the retirement of 573 fossil fuel fired power within these subbasins for power plants using once through cooling technology the vast majority of water withdrawals return to the water source thereby minimizing their individual impact on downstream flow volumes though an end of thermal water pollution associated with the retirement of power plants will likely have an impact on downstream water temperatures miara et al 2018 almost one fourth 512 of the 2 099 subbasins in the us will experience a net increase in streamflow due to the retirement of fossil fuel fired power plants while 0 8 16 subbasins experience a net decrease in streamflow most subbasins with plant retirements will experience a small increase 1 in annual streamflow due the cessation of water consumption by fossil fuel fired power plants fig 7 less than one percent of subbasins will see a slight decrease in streamflow when a major portion of generation is supported by non surface water cooling and return flows are discharged to a nearby river the remaining 1 571 subbasins will have a negligible or no change in streamflow due to the retirement of fossil fuel fired power plants changes in streamflow due to the retirement of fossil fuel burning power plants vary by month generally both the maximum volumetric and percent increase in monthly streamflow will occur during the summer july september which is when most existing power plants withdrawal and consume the most water the minimum volumetric and percent increase in streamflow occurs during the spring april june when power plant water use is typically lower and streamflows are naturally higher subbasins in the missouri river region and the upper colorado river region will experience the highest gains in monthly streamflow relative to natural streamflow levels fig 8 nearly two dozen subbasins within these two larger regions will experience over a 5 increase in monthly streamflow by 2035 compared to 2018 conditions the largest volumetric increases in both annual and summer streamflow are predominately in eastern rivers however fig s4 changes in streamflow due to power plant retirements have a greater impact on water availability in subbasins with less naturally available streamflow while some subbasins in the missouri and upper colorado river regions will see a large relative increase in streamflow compared to 2018 levels many of these subbasins have little streamflow to begin with thus while the absolute volume of streamflow made available upon the retirement of power plants is relatively small averaging less than 6 million m3 annually compared to flow at the outlet of the missouri river and upper colorado river it comprises a large portion of total streamflow within these subbasins in comparison several subbasins in the ohio river region and south atlantic gulf region will see a large volumetric increase in streamflow averaging 37 million m3 but this volume only represents a negligible percentage of streamflow for these water abundant regions fig s4 shows the location and magnitude of expected streamflow gain during the summer months mean of july september in 2035 and 2050 compared to 2018 due to the retirement of fossil fuel fired power plants we identified 31 subbasins where the gain in streamflow due to the retirement of fossil fuel fired power plants will lead to a large relative change 5 in streamflow at least one month per year by 2050 fig 9 many of these 31 subbasins will see a large volumetric increase in streamflow more than 10 million m3 streamflow in subbasins within the upper colorado and texas gulf regions will observe the greatest gains in streamflow particularly during the summer season some subbasins while experiencing a large relative increase in already low streamflow will only have a small increase in streamflow magnitude notably many of the 31 subbasins with large changes in streamflow between 2018 and 2050 are hydrologically connected such as subbasins along the platte river mississippi river and yampa river retirement of fossil fuel fired power plants not only has impacts on streamflow within the subbasin where the power plant is located but plant retirements can create notable impacts to streamflow in downstream subbasins as an example the comanche generating station located in the upper arkansas subbasin in the arkansas white red region is among the largest water consuming 36th fossil fuel burning power plants in the us the retirement of the comanche generating station will make 14 5 million m3 1 5 of annual streamflow water available locally including 1 0 million m3 8 0 during the low flow month of february likewise immediately downstream the upper arkansas lake meredith subbasin will experience a 1 3 increase in annual streamflow and a 6 4 increase during the low flow month of february annual streamflow will remain above 1 of pre plant retirement conditions for over 500 km downstream reflecting the nonlocal water availability impacts of fossil fuel fired power plant retirement the retirement of fossil fuel burning power plants has a larger impact on streamflow during exceptionally dry periods compared to wet or average years fig s5 shows the impact of the retirement of fossil fuel fired power plants on streamflow under conditions matching those from a historically wet year 1993 dry year 1963 and recent year 2015 during a year similar to 1963 when many streams had low flow conditions 102 subbasins would have a 5 gain in streamflow at least one month per year by 2050 compared to 31 subbasins under average flow conditions the number of subbasins with more than 1 of its annual natural streamflow withdrawn by fossil fuel fired power plants under a low flow scenario reaches 65 by 2035 and to 21 by 2050 compared to 50 and 13 respectively for average flow conditions 4 conclusions this study reveals changes in us water availability and streamflow due to the retirement of fossil fuel fired power plants through the coupling of a lifespan based model of fossil fuel fired generator retirements and a hydrologic model we show that water withdrawals and consumption of fossil fuel fired power generators will be significantly curtailed 85 and 68 reduction respectively by 2035 if generators retire upon reaching average retirement age most rivers with fossil fuel fired power plants diverting or discharging water will have a net increase in annual streamflow with the most pronounced increases occurring in the summer months the retirement of these power generators can produce noticeable impacts on streamflow volumes up to hundreds of kilometers downstream by the retirement of the last fossil fuel fired power generator in 2066 2 6 billion m3 of water that was once consumed by these power plants will be made available for other uses while most of this water will be made available in the eastern us the retirement of fossil fuel burning power plants in the western us will make a large contribution to streamflow in dozens of water limited subbasins the retirement of fossil fuel fired power plants provides an opportunity to meet the unmet water demands of other water users including the environment even in areas not facing water stress our results could inform water storage allocations e g flood storage and other water resources management decisions in the eastern us water supply benefits will be minimal in most basins under average flow conditions but could have larger benefits during drought however a reduction in thermal pollution caused by plants discharging heated return water to water bodies will have wide ranging environmental benefits miara et al 2018 logan and stillwell 2018 in water stressed basins within the western us we show that the retirement of fossil fuel fired power generators will make nontrivial amounts of water available given the high value of water in these regions it is likely these water rights will be sold to support new urban development or other high value uses if the water rights of retired power plants are sold to downstream water users the increase of instream flows between the power plant and new user can create co benefits by improving ecosystem health along the way kendy et al 2018 at least 50 fossil fuel fired power plants fulfill their water demand by damming rivers eia 2021a 2021b once these power plants are retired hundreds of millions of cubic meters of reservoir storage allocated for these power plants may be reallocated to other purposes such as irrigation or public water supplies or to buffer the effects of a new climate regime in some cases dam removal may be a viable option thereby allowing a return of the natural streamflow regime and an unimpeded corridor for fish and sediment disinvestment and deferred maintenance at fossil fuel fired power plants in response to both expectations of future climate action and competition from low cost low emissions electricity generation sources could pose major challenges for ensuring regular maintenance of power plant owned dams government agencies should devise plans to ensure the retirement of power plants does not lead to unmaintained water infrastructure to avoid dam failure and catastrophic flooding as was the case in 2020 with a hydropower dam edenville dam in central michigan for over a century and a half society has harnessed rivers to generate electricity while rivers will continue to play a role in electricity production for the foreseeable future that role will likely be diminished as other natural resources that do not depend on rivers namely solar and wind play an increasingly larger role in electricity generation economic and regulatory headwinds centered on making electricity more affordable and less carbon intensive will have the incidental impact of making the electricity sector less water dependent which will benefit other water users and the environment data availability data and model output needed to replicate or extend this study are provided as supplementary

2517,nearly two thirds of fossil fuel fired electricity generation capacity in the united states is expected to reach its typical end of life by 2035 while the closure of fossil fuel fired power plants will help advance decarbonization goals the cessation of water use for fossil fuel fired power plant cooling the largest water user in the us will also impact the nation s water resources we assess when where and how much water will be made available upon the expected retirement of the nation s nearly one thousand fossil fuel fired power plants by combining a lifespan based model of fossil fuel fired generator retirements for the us fossil fuel fired electricity generation fleet with a national scale hydrologic model we show that annual water withdrawals and consumption of fossil fuel fired power generators will be significantly curtailed 85 and 68 reduction respectively by 2035 if these generators follow their typical retirement timeline most rivers with fossil fuel fired power plants diverting and or discharging water will have a net increase in annual streamflow after plant retirement maximum decrease of 2 maximum increase of 57 by 2050 with the most pronounced increases occurring in the summer months the retirement of fossil fuel fired power plants will lead to a large relative change 5 in streamflow at least one month per year by 2050 in 31 subbasins the retirement of power generators was shown to produce noticeable streamflow impacts up to hundreds of kilometers downstream by the retirement of the last us fossil fuel fired power generator 2 6 billion m3 of water that was once consumed by these power plants could be made available for other uses in addition to the global benefits of reduced greenhouse gas emissions the notable increases in streamflow and water availability in many us rivers due to the retirement of fossil fuel fired power plants could benefit local water users and ecosystems keywords fossil fuel fired power plants decarbonization water use streamflow water availability 1 introduction fossil fuel fired power plants will need to close or radically alter their operations for rapid decarbonization in response to climate change pfeiffer et al 2016 the white house 2021 tong et al 2019 williams et al 2021 united states fossil fuel fired power plants are aging with over 70 of capacity expected to reach a typical fuel and prime mover specific lifespan by 2035 president biden s target date for decarbonizing the electricity sector grubert 2020b in addition to the primary policy target of decarbonization closing fossil fuel fired power plants stops other ongoing impacts of plant operations notably including air pollution giang and selin 2016 grubert 2020b henneman et al 2019 hertwich et al 2014 tessum et al 2019 another major dynamic related to fossil fuel fired power plant closure though is cessation of water use withdrawal and consumption for fossil fuel fired power plant needs most significantly cooling dieter et al 2018 grubert and sanders 2018 lohrmann et al 2019 lubega and stillwell 2019 macknick et al 2012a macknick et al 2012b madden et al 2013 peer et al 2019 peer and sanders 2016 2018 more water is withdrawn in the us to produce electricity than any other economic sector dieter et al 2018 the portion of the withdrawn water not evaporated by the power plant will return to a waterbody or be held on site for reuse the fraction of water withdrawn from a waterbody that is consumed varies by power plant and is primarily related to the cooling technology used water consumption related to fossil fuel fired power plants is significantly less than withdrawals marston et al 2018 yet these power plants water consumption have important implications on water availability wang et al 2017 lee et al 2020 fossil fuel fired power plants can be a major contributor to water stress averyt et al 2011 2013 climate change and population growth will further strain already stressed watersheds brown et al 2019 accentuating the large spatially concentrated water withdrawals by fossil fuel fired power plants the impact of fossil fuel burning power plants water withdrawals and consumption is particularly pronounced in the summer de la guardia et al 2022 water withdrawals and consumption by power plants typically peaks in the summer due to higher evaporative potential and large electricity demands miara et al 2018 which often coincides with peak water use by other sectors and a low flow period for many rivers a reduction of water consumption by fossil fuel burning power plants could make water available to meet new or growing water demands or be set aside to meet environmental water needs this research combines a lifespan based model of fossil fuel fired generator retirements for the us fossil fuel fired electricity generation fleet grubert 2020b with a national scale hydrologic model to determine when where and how much water will be made available upon the expected retirement of the nearly one thousand fossil fuel fired power plants across the us that rely on water for cooling we resolved generator level annual water consumption and withdrawal records to a monthly timestep and then determined how a change in streamflow due to retirement of a fossil fuel burning power plant will impact local and downstream water availability while previous studies have assessed changes in water use by the electric sector under different scenarios e g ackerman and fisher 2013 cameron et al 2014 macknick et al 2012a macknick et al 2012b tidwell et al 2013 liu et al 2015 peer and sanders 2018 fulton and jin 2021 they do not capture the spatially and temporally important hydrologic details afforded by our coupled modeling approach we show in this study that the impact of fossil fuel fired power plants on water availability can be seen locally but also propagate downstream through the hydrologic network furthermore streamflow impacts vary significantly by subbasin month and in response to temporal climate variability which demonstrates the importance of the refined spatial and temporal resolution of our study 2 methods annual water withdrawals and consumption water source and lifespan for each fossil fuel fired generator were estimated using the model and data described in grubert 2020b which assumes fossil fuel fired generators retire upon reaching their 2018 fuel and generation technology specific average lifespan this model projects future us fossil fuel fired electricity generation and several socioenvironmental attributes emissions water use labor requirements by assuming that generators continue to operate at their 2018 output levels until they reach a typical lifespan annual freshwater withdrawals and consumption for each generator were resolved to the monthly timestep and to the eight digit hydrologic unit code huc8 or subbasin level to be used by the national scale hydrologic model that simulates the hydrologic impact of abstractions from surface water and groundwater sources at the monthly time step for each huc8 subbasin in the contiguous united states data preparation and model integration are detailed below 2 1 monthly water withdrawal and consumption estimates estimated generator level water consumption from grubert 2020b uses an annual timestep whereas the hydrologic model used in this study uses a monthly timestep we project water consumption through 2075 to include the typical lifespan of all existing fossil fuel fired generators indexed to 2018 in grubert 2020b and any currently under construction to facilitate model updates accordingly this work downscales projected 2018 2075 annual average water consumption for power plants with at least one fossil fuel fired generator operable as of 2018 to the monthly level reflecting two major dynamics that are relevant for evaluating water consumption in context namely 1 power generation seasonality and 2 evaporative water intensity seasonality our approach is necessary due to a lack ofaccurate comprehensivesubannual water use records chini and delorit 2021 the energy information administration eia which is the primary federal agency for collecting analyzing and distributing energy data has published estimated monthly water withdrawals and consumption at the boiler level since 2014 eia 2022 however these data are neither accurate nor complete for the needs of this work for 2020 eia data show zero water withdrawal for 40 and zero water consumption for 50 of the 926 plants for which we model ongoing water use as of 2020 these entries are often clearly incorrect for example with entries of zero water withdrawal for plants with nonzero water consumption despite these data discrepancies that we would expect to contribute to an overall underestimate eia estimates for water withdrawals and consumption for our modeled plant population are a factor of ten higher than our modeled estimates which are consistent with other published aggregate data for the universe of plants eia models which includes non fossil plants eia estimated 2020 thermoelectric water withdrawal is approximately five times and estimated 2020 thermoelectric water consumption is approximately five times that estimated by usgs for 2015 dieter et al 2018 potential explanations include inconsistent definitions e g reporting total cooling flow volumes inclusive of recirculation rather than withdrawals from a water body multiple counting due to complex relationships between boilers and cooling systems and misreports as such we model projected monthly water withdrawal and consumption using physical relationships contributingconsideration of seasonal generation and evaporative capacity wang et al 2017 lee et al 2020 fulton and jin 2021 we describe these dynamics and the modeling approach below data and calculations are included in this work as the supplementary data file annual generator level water consumption is assigned to us power plants that had at least one fossil fuel fired generator operable as of 2018 in the eia 860 database eia 2021a this assignment proceeds by aggregating estimated fossil fuel fired generator annual water consumption to the plant level based on the plant id field for each year between 2018 and 2075 inclusive by which point all fossil fuel fired us generators will have reached mean age on retirement for their type grubert 2020b a power plant s water withdrawals and consumption revert to zero upon retirement generators are assumed to run at modeled 2018 levels i e with modeled 2018 annual water consumption so for each year the model used in this work assigns generator level water consumption to a plant if the generator has not yet passed its modeled closure date grubert 2020b plants that had no generators with water consumption as of 2018 which were essentially all air cooled natural gas and oil fired combustion generators were discarded from this analysis removing these 2 005 plants with no 2018 modeled water consumption left 976 plants accounting for 640 gw of us 2018 fossil nameplate capacity out of a total of 840 gw power generation seasonality is incorporated to reflect that power generation is not consistent throughout the year electricity demand and thus generation is typically highest in summer then winter in the united states in part because of the major contribution of heating and cooling demand and because air conditioning summer cooling is essentially entirely electrified while winter heating is not eia 2013 as such most us electricity systems are summer peaking although we caution that decarbonization motivated electrification williams et al 2021 is expected to alter these relationships over the projection period of this study this study therefore assumes two alternatives for power generation seasonality a 2019 fleet average seasonality for steam fossil generation coal distillate fuel oil and natural gas eia 2021b and b no seasonality that is monthly generation is assigned assuming equal generation for every day steam fossil generation is bundled across fuel resources to avoid false precision seasonality for these resources is similar enough to support the coarse analysis in this study that is even historical annual generation patterns vary interannually e g due to weather and maintenance cycles and across generators e g due to variable regional contexts and expected major changes to the electricity sector suggest that past performance might not be a good predictor of future operational patterns given that generation is often higher during summer when water resources are more stressed in much of the us capturing the dynamic of higher water consumption during periods of high summer electricity demand was deemed to be sufficiently relevant for evaluating water quantity impacts that the 2019 pattern is included illustratively these two alternatives are illustrated in fig 1 with the steam coal and natural gas trends shown separately for context as with power generation seasonality evaporative water intensity seasonality can be highly variable across contexts evaporative water intensity seasonality reflects the point that higher water temperatures are associated with higher evaporative potential such that a unit of heat input to a unit of cooling water in a cold january month results in less evaporative water consumption than would occur with the same units of heat input and cooling water in a warm july our first order analysis includes two illustrative scenarios of evaporative water intensity seasonality i average evaporative seasonality as calculated using the evaporation model from diehl et al 2013 for a sample of usgs temperature sites with complete monthly data segura et al 2015 and ii the most extreme evaporative seasonality from that same sample of sites where the most extreme is defined as the seasonality at the site with the highest difference between minimum and maximum evaporative potential evaporative seasonality is calculated using diehl s model of forced evaporation from a water surface fews v3 104 diehl et al 2013 using all default parameters except natural water temperature t in degrees celsius to calculate the output metric evaporated gallons per mwh thermal condenser duty by month and on average over the course of a year due to this work s interest in the seasonality pattern rather than estimated water consumption per unit of generation because of access to plant level annual water consumption records monthly evaporation was normalized by average annual evaporation to give a monthly evaporative potential value in percent equation 1 1 evaporative p o t e n t i a l m evaporated g a l l o n s p e r m w h t h e r m a l c o n d e n s e r d u t y m evaporated g a l l o n s p e r m w h t h e r m a l c o n d e n s e r d u t y y where m is month and y is year calculated thusly the monthly evaporative potential is invariant to dry bulb wet bulb and plant characteristics as implemented in fews v3 104 under the fews v3 104 model evaporative potential is a function of the monthly natural water temperature we hold other model parameters at their default values usgs water temperature sites were taken from segura et al 2015 noting that stream water temperature data are sparse and thus difficult to obtain for sites that are directly relevant for power plant intakes here we use the 62 sites for which a full set of monthly average water temperature data were available shown in fig 2 alongside power plants with at least one fossil fuel fired generator operable as of 2018 as such the sites used for this analysis are not representative of sites supplying power plant cooling water they are however highly validated with high quality temperature records and thus considered suitable for this first order analysis average evaporative seasonality is the simple average of monthly evaporative potential equation 2 across the 62 sites for which a full set of monthly average water temperature data were available no location weighting of water temperature seasonality was attempted for this first order analysis because a meaningful weighting metric reflecting variable conditions at the power plants of interest was not available instead we assess two evaporative seasonalities within this analysis see fig s1 for a visual depiction to test sensitivity the average and the extreme seasonality profile from site 5057000 on the sheyenne river in eastern north dakota w monthly water consumption january 2018 through december 2075 at point of generation was estimated by combining power generation and evaporative seasonalities with annual estimates of water consumption as follows equation 2 where m is month and y is year 2 water c o n s u m p t i o n m water c o n s u m p t i o n y generation m generation y evaporative p o t e n t i a l m evaporative p o t e n t i a l y m generation m generation y evaporative p o t e n t i a l m evaporative p o t e n t i a l y in the equation above the combined seasonality estimate seasonal generation multiplied by seasonal evaporative potential in a given month is renormalized by the sum of the combined monthly seasonality estimates to ensure total water consumption for the year is preserved see the supplementary data file for more details fig 3 shows the four profiles two approaches to estimating generation seasonality combined with two approaches to estimating evaporative potential seasonality used in this analysis pairings of the two generation and two evaporative seasonality profiles yield four different seasonality scenarios table 1 different combinations of generation and evaporation scenarios for fossil fuel fired power plants generated very similar projected streamflow estimation at the subbasin level fig s2 considering the negligible impact of evaporation and generation scenario on streamflow estimation we used average evaporation combined with average generation throughout our analysis the evaporation and generation scenarios have no bearing on annual water withdrawal and consumption estimates of this study only the partitioning of annual water use estimates to each month 2 2 national scale hydrologic model the effects of the fossil fuel fired power plant water use scenarios on streamflow were assessed using the water supply stress index wassi hydrologic model developed by the us department of agriculture forest service caldwell et al 2012 sun et al 2011 wassi has been extensively tested through comparison to observed flows at us geological gauging sites and comparison to other models caldwell et al 2012 li et al 2020 schwalm et al 2015 sun et al 2015 the wassi model estimates monthly streamflow for each of the 2 099 huc8 subbasins in the contiguous us by computing the watershed water balance as affected by climate land use soil properties and topographical characteristics and then accumulating streamflow through the river network importantly wassi accounts for and enables assessment of streamflow impacts due to human water abstractions marston et al 2020 richter et al 2020 as our purpose is to isolate the effect of fossil fuel burning power plant retirements on streamflow we hold other water uses such as irrigation and public supply static around recent levels marston et al 2018 marston et al 2020 likewise we evaluated the effects of the retirement scenarios on streamflow using a common climate time period to isolate the effect of the scenarios from potential climate changes many regions have seen fundamental shifts in their hydrology since the start of the century barnett et al 2008 sagarika et al 2014 therefore we selected the 2001 2015 period for analysis and report the impact of plant retirements on the average monthly flow regime during that time in addition we evaluated streamflow impacts during a historically wet year 1993 dry year 1963 and recent year 2015 generator level projections of monthly water withdrawals and consumption between 2018 and 2075 were aggregated within each huc8 subbasin to match the spatial resolution of wassi our water use model accounts for the water withdrawal source e g river natural lake aquifer ocean and disposal location of return flows since they have implications on both current and future hydrologic conditions upon plant retirement when assessing streamflow impacts fossil fuel fired power plants that either withdraw from or discharge to a river or both were included among the 976 power plants analyzed in this study more than half 573 source their water directly from or discharge to a river or both while previous studies assess the effect of future power plant operations our modeling approach is unique in that it accounts for the displacement of water availability impacts to downstream subbasins through the river network 2 3 limitations for fossil fuel fired generators seasonality is driven by electricity demand and increasingly electricity demand net of generation from power plants utilizing flow resources like wind and solar rather than by resource availability for example solar power plants have a clear and inherent seasonality reflecting longer day length in the summertime eia 2021b whereas the higher historical summer generation from coal and natural gas plants is due to dispatching these resources in response to load one major implication for this study is that these generation profiles might change in response to dynamic fuel mixes e g increased solar penetration and dynamic demand e g from electrification of residential heating further these generation profiles might change in ways that vary by region due to variation in climate climate policy and other factors as such results should be interpreted with the understanding that these projected changes to water resource consumption by fossil fuel fired power plants reflect anticipated conditions absent climate policy or climate change similarly water evaporation profiles do not reflect future climatic conditions notably changing heat and humidity relationships as with the original model grubert 2020b the assumption of constant 2018 output and impacts for all future years a generator is expected to operate is intended as a coarse proxy for a counterfactual scenario without strong climate policy and other retirement forcing functions noting that the assumption of constant output over time has historically been a reasonable simplification at the fleet level grubert 2020a but likely overestimates future coal plant outputs and underestimates future natural gas plant outputs grubert 2020b even assuming history is a good predictor of the future which it might not be this study evaluates the hydrologic and water availability impacts of expected fossil fuel burning power plant retirements the assessment of replacement and new electricity generation facilities on water availability is left for future studies 3 results and discussion 3 1 impact of fossil fuel fired generators retirement on volumetric water use the 976 us fossil fuel fired power plants that we analyzed withdrew 58 4 billion m3 of water from surface water and groundwater sources in 2018 to produce 2 43 billion mwh of electricity the water withdrawals of these 976 power plants exceeded the 148 000 us public water systems 2015 water withdrawals by over 4 5 billion m3 dieter et al 2018 evaporative cooling at fossil fuel fired power plants consumed around 4 5 of the withdrawn water thus making this water unavailable for downstream use by the time the last generator reaches typical retirement age 2066 a decrease in water consumption related to evaporative cooling will make an additional 2 64 billion m3 of fresh surface water available nationwide analysis based on the retirement of fossil fuel fired generators predicts a sharp decline in water withdrawals and consumption within the next two decades and a complete cessation of water use by existing fossil fuel fired generators by the year 2066 fig 4 water withdrawals from fossil fuel fired power plants are expected to decline more quickly than water consumption nearly 64 of 2018 electricity generation and 50 of the fossil fuel fired power plants will be at retirement age between 2018 and 2035 yet these plant retirements will lead to an 85 reduction in water withdrawals from 58 4 billion m3 to 8 6 billion m3 fig 4 within the same timeframe consumptive water use of fossil fuel fired electricity generation will decrease by 68 from 2 6 billion m3 to 0 84 billion m3 the disproportionate reduction in water withdrawals compared to water consumption in the near term reflects more retirements of power plants that employ once through cooling technology which has significantly larger water withdrawals relative to consumption compared to recirculating cooling technology almost all hydrologic regions huc2 will see a faster decline in water withdrawals than water consumption by 2035 fig 5 the retirement of fossil fuel fired power plants in the missouri river region which is the hydrologic region with the largest withdrawals by volume and whose power plants largely use once through cooling systems will reduce water withdrawals by 94 by 2035 the water stressed rio grande and upper colorado will see reductions in water withdrawals and consumption greater than 85 of 2018 rates by 2035 water withdrawals by fossil fuel burning power plants in the upper and lower colorado regions will decline by a combined 238 million m3 by 2035 while seemingly a large volume of water this reduction in water withdrawals only amounts to 1 3 of the total water allocated to the upper and lower colorado region states there will be a similar decrease in water consumption 163 million m3 or 69 of the reduction in withdrawals within the colorado river region due to prevalence of recirculating cooling technology in the region regional estimates of trends in water withdrawal and consumption aggregated by huc2 hydrologic regions are shown in fig s3 3 2 impact of fossil fuel fired power plant retirements on streamflow among the 352 huc8 subbasins where fossil fuel fired power plants withdraw from and or discharge to a river these power plants withdrew more than 1 of total 2001 2015 mean annual natural streamflow in 111 subbasins and consumed more than 1 of total annual streamflow in 24 subbasins under 2018 levels of water use fig 6 a and 6d annual water withdrawals and consumption of fossil fuel fired power plants constituted more than 25 of natural streamflow in 25 and 3 subbasins respectively in this scenario surface water withdrawals in six subbasins and water consumption in two subbasins surpassed total annual natural streamflow within the subbasin under this scenario such anomalies occurred when the cooling water is withdrawn from and discharged to a reservoir for repeated use e g thomas hill lake in little chariton subbasin lake sakakawea in lake sakakawea subbasin jim bridger reservoir in bitter subbasin water is diverted from an adjacent large water body e g cape canaveral power plant diverts from the indian river near the subbasin outlet or water is transferred from a nearby subbasin to supply power plant s e g middle san juan to chaco subbasin raisin to ottawa stony subbasin the number of subbasins with more than 1 of its annual streamflow withdrawn in 2018 reduces from 111 to 50 by 2035 and to 13 by 2050 fig 6b and 6c all 352 subbasins with fossil fuel fired power plants that withdrawal from or discharge to a river will experience changes to streamflow due to the retirement of 573 fossil fuel fired power within these subbasins for power plants using once through cooling technology the vast majority of water withdrawals return to the water source thereby minimizing their individual impact on downstream flow volumes though an end of thermal water pollution associated with the retirement of power plants will likely have an impact on downstream water temperatures miara et al 2018 almost one fourth 512 of the 2 099 subbasins in the us will experience a net increase in streamflow due to the retirement of fossil fuel fired power plants while 0 8 16 subbasins experience a net decrease in streamflow most subbasins with plant retirements will experience a small increase 1 in annual streamflow due the cessation of water consumption by fossil fuel fired power plants fig 7 less than one percent of subbasins will see a slight decrease in streamflow when a major portion of generation is supported by non surface water cooling and return flows are discharged to a nearby river the remaining 1 571 subbasins will have a negligible or no change in streamflow due to the retirement of fossil fuel fired power plants changes in streamflow due to the retirement of fossil fuel burning power plants vary by month generally both the maximum volumetric and percent increase in monthly streamflow will occur during the summer july september which is when most existing power plants withdrawal and consume the most water the minimum volumetric and percent increase in streamflow occurs during the spring april june when power plant water use is typically lower and streamflows are naturally higher subbasins in the missouri river region and the upper colorado river region will experience the highest gains in monthly streamflow relative to natural streamflow levels fig 8 nearly two dozen subbasins within these two larger regions will experience over a 5 increase in monthly streamflow by 2035 compared to 2018 conditions the largest volumetric increases in both annual and summer streamflow are predominately in eastern rivers however fig s4 changes in streamflow due to power plant retirements have a greater impact on water availability in subbasins with less naturally available streamflow while some subbasins in the missouri and upper colorado river regions will see a large relative increase in streamflow compared to 2018 levels many of these subbasins have little streamflow to begin with thus while the absolute volume of streamflow made available upon the retirement of power plants is relatively small averaging less than 6 million m3 annually compared to flow at the outlet of the missouri river and upper colorado river it comprises a large portion of total streamflow within these subbasins in comparison several subbasins in the ohio river region and south atlantic gulf region will see a large volumetric increase in streamflow averaging 37 million m3 but this volume only represents a negligible percentage of streamflow for these water abundant regions fig s4 shows the location and magnitude of expected streamflow gain during the summer months mean of july september in 2035 and 2050 compared to 2018 due to the retirement of fossil fuel fired power plants we identified 31 subbasins where the gain in streamflow due to the retirement of fossil fuel fired power plants will lead to a large relative change 5 in streamflow at least one month per year by 2050 fig 9 many of these 31 subbasins will see a large volumetric increase in streamflow more than 10 million m3 streamflow in subbasins within the upper colorado and texas gulf regions will observe the greatest gains in streamflow particularly during the summer season some subbasins while experiencing a large relative increase in already low streamflow will only have a small increase in streamflow magnitude notably many of the 31 subbasins with large changes in streamflow between 2018 and 2050 are hydrologically connected such as subbasins along the platte river mississippi river and yampa river retirement of fossil fuel fired power plants not only has impacts on streamflow within the subbasin where the power plant is located but plant retirements can create notable impacts to streamflow in downstream subbasins as an example the comanche generating station located in the upper arkansas subbasin in the arkansas white red region is among the largest water consuming 36th fossil fuel burning power plants in the us the retirement of the comanche generating station will make 14 5 million m3 1 5 of annual streamflow water available locally including 1 0 million m3 8 0 during the low flow month of february likewise immediately downstream the upper arkansas lake meredith subbasin will experience a 1 3 increase in annual streamflow and a 6 4 increase during the low flow month of february annual streamflow will remain above 1 of pre plant retirement conditions for over 500 km downstream reflecting the nonlocal water availability impacts of fossil fuel fired power plant retirement the retirement of fossil fuel burning power plants has a larger impact on streamflow during exceptionally dry periods compared to wet or average years fig s5 shows the impact of the retirement of fossil fuel fired power plants on streamflow under conditions matching those from a historically wet year 1993 dry year 1963 and recent year 2015 during a year similar to 1963 when many streams had low flow conditions 102 subbasins would have a 5 gain in streamflow at least one month per year by 2050 compared to 31 subbasins under average flow conditions the number of subbasins with more than 1 of its annual natural streamflow withdrawn by fossil fuel fired power plants under a low flow scenario reaches 65 by 2035 and to 21 by 2050 compared to 50 and 13 respectively for average flow conditions 4 conclusions this study reveals changes in us water availability and streamflow due to the retirement of fossil fuel fired power plants through the coupling of a lifespan based model of fossil fuel fired generator retirements and a hydrologic model we show that water withdrawals and consumption of fossil fuel fired power generators will be significantly curtailed 85 and 68 reduction respectively by 2035 if generators retire upon reaching average retirement age most rivers with fossil fuel fired power plants diverting or discharging water will have a net increase in annual streamflow with the most pronounced increases occurring in the summer months the retirement of these power generators can produce noticeable impacts on streamflow volumes up to hundreds of kilometers downstream by the retirement of the last fossil fuel fired power generator in 2066 2 6 billion m3 of water that was once consumed by these power plants will be made available for other uses while most of this water will be made available in the eastern us the retirement of fossil fuel burning power plants in the western us will make a large contribution to streamflow in dozens of water limited subbasins the retirement of fossil fuel fired power plants provides an opportunity to meet the unmet water demands of other water users including the environment even in areas not facing water stress our results could inform water storage allocations e g flood storage and other water resources management decisions in the eastern us water supply benefits will be minimal in most basins under average flow conditions but could have larger benefits during drought however a reduction in thermal pollution caused by plants discharging heated return water to water bodies will have wide ranging environmental benefits miara et al 2018 logan and stillwell 2018 in water stressed basins within the western us we show that the retirement of fossil fuel fired power generators will make nontrivial amounts of water available given the high value of water in these regions it is likely these water rights will be sold to support new urban development or other high value uses if the water rights of retired power plants are sold to downstream water users the increase of instream flows between the power plant and new user can create co benefits by improving ecosystem health along the way kendy et al 2018 at least 50 fossil fuel fired power plants fulfill their water demand by damming rivers eia 2021a 2021b once these power plants are retired hundreds of millions of cubic meters of reservoir storage allocated for these power plants may be reallocated to other purposes such as irrigation or public water supplies or to buffer the effects of a new climate regime in some cases dam removal may be a viable option thereby allowing a return of the natural streamflow regime and an unimpeded corridor for fish and sediment disinvestment and deferred maintenance at fossil fuel fired power plants in response to both expectations of future climate action and competition from low cost low emissions electricity generation sources could pose major challenges for ensuring regular maintenance of power plant owned dams government agencies should devise plans to ensure the retirement of power plants does not lead to unmaintained water infrastructure to avoid dam failure and catastrophic flooding as was the case in 2020 with a hydropower dam edenville dam in central michigan for over a century and a half society has harnessed rivers to generate electricity while rivers will continue to play a role in electricity production for the foreseeable future that role will likely be diminished as other natural resources that do not depend on rivers namely solar and wind play an increasingly larger role in electricity generation economic and regulatory headwinds centered on making electricity more affordable and less carbon intensive will have the incidental impact of making the electricity sector less water dependent which will benefit other water users and the environment data availability data and model output needed to replicate or extend this study are provided as supplementary

2518,groundwater transit time distributions ttds the travel times through the aquifer from recharge at the water table to discharge at the surface water body provide critical information on the timescales of hydrologic response of subsurface flow systems we investigated the effects of spatial patterns of recharge aquifer heterogeneity and systematic variation in riverbed hydraulic conductivity on the mean transit times mtts and ttds of groundwater discharge to the upper middle loup river umlr and headwaters using a 3d steady state modflow usg modpathd3du model this 5436 km2 watershed overlies the high plains aquifer in the sand hills of nebraska usa modeled mtts differed by up to three orders of magnitude from upstream to downstream in a 158 km section of the umlr under varying recharge aquifer and riverbed heterogeneity scenarios the simulated mtts ranged from 1 to 397 years for upstream sites and 820 to 7968 years for the downstream sites the ttds at upstream sites were dominated by young groundwater from shallow flow paths and were sensitive to changes in riverbed hydraulic conductivity recharge parameterization had greater influence on the shape of the ttds and magnitude of mtts at the downstream sites where much older groundwater discharged to the umlr overall spatial trends in transit times under varying model scenarios provided important information for refined conceptualization and calibration of future numerical models keywords groundwater modeling particle tracking groundwater transit times nebraska sand hills data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction modeling groundwater mean transit times mtts and transit time distributions ttds is critical for characterizing the hydrological responses of subsurface flow systems jing et al 2019 and estimating travel times for contaminants that discharge from aquifers basu et al 2012 ilampooranan et al 2019 leray et al 2019 browne and guldan 2005 modica et al 1998 kennedy et al 2009 gilmore et al 2016 groundwater ttds are especially effective tools for evaluating lag times between the input of non point source pollution and its discharge to groundwater wells and streams different analytical lumped parameter models lpms and coupled numerical groundwater models and particle tracking algorithms can be used to simulate groundwater ttds lumped parameter models are characterized by the ttd functions whose parameters can be calibrated by the experimental observations of tracers transported between recharge input and discharge output areas małoszewski and zuber 1982 maloszewski 2000 numerical groundwater and transport models are mainly based on the solution of the groundwater flow and transport equations in which the transit times could be governed by advection only conditions i e kinematic age modica et al 1998 maxwell et al 2016 eberts et al 2012 basu et al 2012 gusyev et al 2014 or advection along with other transport processes such as dispersion diffusion and reaction goode 1996 varni and carrera 1998 the latter is based on equations derived from both residence time distribution concepts and mass conservation principles applied to conceptual age mass rather than just kinematic ages based on average linear groundwater velocities the effects of spatially varying recharge or aquifer hydraulic parameters on the shape of ttds have been investigated in multiple studies abrams and haitjema 2018 jing et al 2019 leray et al 2019 rumynin et al 2019 sanford 2011 edington and poeter 2006 the effects of heterogeneity in riverbed conductivity on fluxes between aquifer and river have been studied e g irvine et al 2012 kurtz et al 2013 tang et al 2017 however effects of riverbed hydraulic conductivity on the groundwater ttds have not been explored engdahl and maxwell 2015 studied the effects of recharge variation induced by climate change on ttds which had significant changes between different climate scenarios abrams and haitjema 2018 simulated ttds using an lpm and modflow modpath and concluded that the parameters such as saturated thickness porosity and groundwater recharge control the shape of the exponential ttds a catchment scale groundwater ttd study carried out by jing et al 2019 showed that the shape of ttds is strongly dependent on groundwater recharge rates and sensitive to recharge spatial patterns effects of non uniform aquifer structure and groundwater recharge conditions on residence time distributions were investigated by leray et al 2019 using an analytical modeling approach their study found that the shape of the residence time distribution is significantly modified by including the aquifer structure and recharge gradients in their semi analytical model etcheverry and perrochet 2000 linked the asymmetry and multimodality in the ttds to the aquifer geometry and heterogeneity in the groundwater flow velocities where they modeled a regional multilayered aquifer using an analytical method understanding the vertical variations in hydraulic properties of aquifers is critical for explaining the groundwater flow dynamics dietze and dietrich 2012 an increase of hydraulic conductivity with depth in some stratigraphic sequences results from depositional processes in sand bed braided rivers zlotnik et al 2011 on the contrary a decrease of hydraulic conductivity with depth in consolidated systems is generally attributed to spatial variation in fracture intensity where the fractures in the shallow crust deformed in response to stresses induced by earthquake waves earth tides tectonic stresses and groundwater pumping earnest and boutt 2014 and also compaction due to the greater total stress fetter 2001 p 89 cardenas and jiang 2010 state that the exponentially decreasing regional scale heterogeneity enhances the power law residence time distribution by increasing the deeper slow flowing zone and accelerating the fluxes near the land surface furthermore rumynin et al 2019 investigated the effects of hydraulic conductivity anisotropy and depth decay coefficients on groundwater flow and ttds using computational simulations they concluded that the relationship between ttds and the monotonically increasing and decreasing hydraulic conductivity may exhibit non monotonic behavior edington and poeter 2006 investigated the effects of vertical heterogeneity on travel times using a modflow modpath model where they obtained the geological model using a stratigraphy simulator fluvsim their study concluded that groundwater travel times were younger under a low accommodation e g low amount of space available for sediment accumulation stratigraphy and older under high accommodation stratigraphy sanford 2011 also found that the spatial variation in recharge and hydraulic conductivity makes a significant difference in age distributions but the sensitivity of age to vertical hydraulic conductivity is not clear since it is generally poorly constrained in modeling studies past theoretical studies indicate that simulated transit times are sensitive to spatial heterogeneity in recharge aquifer structure and likely streambed conductance however there is lack of site specific studies that systematically account for the effect of heterogeneity of these parameters on groundwater ttd modeled for multiple streambed discharge points at a watershed scale the objective of our study was to evaluate the effects of spatial complexity of recharge structural heterogeneity of aquifer characteristics and systematic variation in riverbed hydraulic conductivity on the ttds and mtts in six river sites along a 158 km section of the upper middle loup river umlr in the nebraska sand hills this study yields insight into model sensitivity of ttds at different spatial scales ranging between 14 and 5436 km2 that can aid future groundwater studies 2 methods modeling code modflow usg panday et al 2012 was used to simulate three dimensional steady state groundwater flow in the upper middle loup river umlr watershed fig 1 after a base model scenario uniform recharge aquifer and streambed parameters fig 1 step 3a hypothetical recharge and aquifer parameter scenarios were applied in the model fig 1 steps 3b and 3c respectively finally the role of the magnitude and heterogeneity of riverbed conductance was investigated fig 1 step d for each scenario groundwater ttds from backward particle tracking were examined step 4 through step 6 to determine the effect of the different recharge and hydrogeologic heterogeneity

increase the model performance and the computational efficiency by refining only river cells in the flow domain modpath3du was selected as a particle tracking code since it can handle high spatial variability of flow fields in the individual unstructured cells where the particle tracking scheme is not susceptible to weak sinks craig et al 2020 2 1 study site this study focuses on systematic evaluation of hydrologic processes that potentially control the characteristics of groundwater ttds of groundwater discharging to the umlr the umlr watershed which covers an area of 5436 km2 in the

connected geological units of quaternary and late tertiary age gutentag et al 1984 the uppermost geological unit in the sand hills is the holocene eolian dunes and pleistocene sand gravel silt and clay which overlies the pliocene sands and gravels korus et al 2011 sand and sandstone of miocene and oligocene units ogallala group comprise the major aquifer unit in the sand hills korus et al 2011 the base of the aquifer system is the siltstones of the miocene ogallala and oligocene arikaree groups saturated aquifer thickness varies from near zero to 314 m with an average of 161 m rossman et al 2018 there are very few artificial aquifer stresses such as pumping to cause transient groundwater flow conditions as cropland makes up only 0 23 of the model area and population is sparse the stream

with the groundwater vistas 7 rumbaugh and rumbaugh 2017 graphical user interface gui was used to simulate three dimensional steady state flow this code uses a finite difference numerical approximation method to solve the governing partial differential flow equation in a discretized flow domain the area of the flow domain was determined as 5436 km2 based on the physical boundary conditions of the aquifer system within the watershed the base of the aquifer was set as a no flow boundary which represents the low hydraulic conductivity siltstone and claystone levels of the oligocene age white river group we used the base of the aquifer contour map which was developed using available borehole datasets conservation and survey division of university of nebraska lincoln 2019a a 10 m digital elevation model dem was used to represent the top surface of the model domain usgs 2017 western southern and northern boundaries were chosen as no flow boundaries which follow the groundwater divides across the flow domain based on a regional groundwater table map conservation and survey division of university of nebraska lincoln 2019b a constant head boundary was assigned to represent the eastern model boundary based on the potentiometric head contours of the same regional groundwater table map an unstructured quadtree grid refinement panday et al 2013 was used for horizontal discretization of the model domain to create finer grids over and in the vicinity of the streams the quadtree grids formed only 5 of the entire numerical model with two different grid sizes of 250 m and 125 m while the parent grid size remained 500 m aquifer thickness was divided into five layers to simulate the particle streamlines within the three dimensional flow domain model layers were assigned as unconfined where the transmissivity is calculated from the saturated thickness and horizontal hydraulic conductivity of the model layer since long term groundwater levels and discharge show very little variation rossman et al 2018 a steady state simulation was used 2 3 particle tracking simulations the 5 layer regional groundwater flow model was developed to run the particle tracking simulations under steady state conditions a particle tracking code calculates the velocities and tracks the movement of imaginary particles using modeled head distribution hydraulic conductivity and effective porosity anderson et al 2015 these particles travel with the average linear groundwater velocity darcy flux divided by effective porosity which represents the advective transport of the solutes the principal components of the velocity vectors in the model cells are calculated with an interpolation method and then the particle streamlines are traced using a particle movement technique derivations of the related particle tracking equations can be found in muffels et al 2016 the lag time effect of the unsaturated zone see szilagyi et al 2011 szilagyi et al 2003 on the ttds was neglected throughout the simulations since the particle tracking clock starts at the potentiometric surface of the aquifer travel times for each numerical model scenario were simulated using a backward particle tracking scheme equal numbers of hypothetical particles located on the river boundary grids representing the different sampling sites were traced backward to their initial recharge locations modpath 3du output files containing the particle travel times and streamlines obtained from each scenario were then post processed in arcgis and coding environments the flux weighted ttds for each streambed sampling site was represented by the recharge weighted cumulative frequency distribution cfrd of the transit times and the weighted mtts were calculated using the following equation kennedy et al 2009 gilmore et al 2016 1 mtt i 1 n r i t i i 1 n r i where n is the total number of particles t i t is the particle transit time and r i l t is the recharge flux at the cell where the particle originates an mtt based on the exponential lpm was also calculated for comparison with the numerical mtts using the following eq 2 derived by haitjema 1995 2 m t t nh n where n is the uniform porosity n l t is the uniform recharge and h l is the average saturated aquifer thickness which is assumed to be constant the nh term represents the volume of the groundwater per unit area of aquifer l3 l2 and n is the volumetric replenishment of groundwater into the aquifer per unit area of aquifer l3 l2t since both h and n are expressed per unit area 1 l2 an exact domain surface area is not required to calculate mtt 2 4 modeling scenarios 2 4 1 baseline scenario the baseline numerical model was run under uniform recharge and aquifer parameterization an average recharge value of 55 mm yr 1 was obtained from modis derived net groundwater recharge map szilagyi and jozsa 2013 and applied to the uppermost active layer in the model domain hydraulic conductivity used average value from houston et al 2013 which used a thickness weighted average of the dataset of hydraulic conductivity and specific yield for the entire high plains aquifer calculated average uniform horizontal hydraulic conductivity kx of 11 m d was assigned to all active model cells vertical hydraulic conductivity kz was assumed to be uniform and 1 1 md 1 0 1 of the kx a vertical anisotropy ratio of 0 1 was considered to be conservative for the purpose of the modeling based on the physical characteristics of the unconsolidated and bedrock aquifers the anisotropy ratios for the similar units were generally reported in the range of 0 01 and 0 5 domenico and schwartz 1990 todd and mays 2005 an average uniform porosity of 0 3 was chosen given the nature of the heterogeneous aquifer materials consisting of plio quaternary and pleistocene aged fine to medium sands and miocene aged consolidated sandstones fetter 2001 p 79 a uniform riverbed hydraulic conductivity value of 0 5 m d 1 within the range of field measurements was chosen to get a better match between simulated heads and regional groundwater table counter map of the study area the model setup for baseline groundwater flow model and particle tracking simulation scenario is given in table s1 2 4 2 recharge heterogeneity scenarios uniform and spatially varying recharge conditions were considered uniform recharge scenarios were chosen as 50 75 125 and 200 of baseline recharge of 55 mm y 1 four different scenarios of spatial variability were simulated general west to east gradient with increasing and decreasing patterns a lateral gradient where recharge is lower near the stream due to higher evapotranspiration and modis based distributed net recharge model in each scenario aquifer and river properties remained identical also each spatially varying recharge scenario used the same total recharge as the baseline scenario 55 mm yr 1 in the first two scenarios with spatially varying recharge the model domain was divided into five equal areas with different recharge rates fig 3 a in scenario 1 recharge increased from west to east and in scenario 2 recharge decreased from west to east calculated recharge values for the zones varied from 27 4 mm yr 1 to 82 1 mm yr 1 the third scenario was based on a lateral gradient along the channel where recharge was lower near the stream due to higher evapotranspiration lateral extent of the stream buffers was determined based on analysis of the normalized difference vegetation index ndvi for the study site fig 3b ndvi is an index based on the reflectance measurements in the visible and near infrared regions of the spectra to examine the dynamics of vegetation deering 1978 in arid and semi arid regions groundwater is a critical source for plant growth and transpiration naumburg et al 2005 wang et al 2011 seeyan et al 2014 thus this may lead to a reduction in young groundwater discharging to streams a recent study parizi et al 2020 concluded that when ndvi was 0 18 groundwater recharge started decreasing with increasing ndvi in their semi arid study area given the similar climatic conditions and high mean ndvi 0 32 in our study area we used this assumption in the lateral gradient recharge scenario multispectral satellite images from landsat tm oli were used to calculate the ndvi 3 n d v i n i r r e d n i r r e d where nir is the reflection in the near infrared spectrum and red is the reflection in the red ranges of the spectrum the red and near infrared bands of landsat 8 surface reflectance images were used to calculate the ndvi myneni et al 1995 in google earth engine the satellite images were cloud masked using pixel quality values vermote et al 2016 and were filtered for cloud cover 5 to represent the growing season average ndvi between may and july were calculated from 2013 to 2020 the ndvi values were then aggregated within the river and non river boundary condition cells the numerical model cells within the stream buffer zones were assigned the highest average ndvi values while the cells outside the stream were given the lowest average ndvi values the total volume of recharge 8 15x105 m3 d 1 was then divided into river and non river boundary cells based on the ndvi ratio recharge values for the stream buffer zones and the rest of the model domain cells were calculated as 15 42 mm yr 1 and 57 76 mm yr 1 respectively fig 3b the fourth recharge scenario used modis derived distributed net groundwater recharge data with a 1 km resolution szilagyi and jozsa 2013 fig 3c calculated recharge ranged between 140 mm yr 1 and 170 00 mm yr 1 the minimum recharge occurred in the western part of the study area where there are multiple lakes and wetlands and evapotranspiration exceeds precipitation 2 4 3 aquifer heterogeneity scenarios effects of regional scale aquifer heterogeneity on the ttds were investigated using six hypothetical aquifer scenarios where porosity and horizontal and vertical hydraulic conductivity values increased three scenarios or decreased three scenarios with the model layer numbers table s2 for increase and decrease scenarios parameter values for five different layers were assigned in increasing and decreasing order in the case of increasing porosity for example the shallowest layer layer 1 was set to 0 1 with increasing porosity values for each layer up to 0 5 for the deepest layer layer 5 table s2 porosity range used in the aquifer heterogeneity scenarios was determined based on the wide range of consolidated and unconsolidated lithological units unconsolidated sand gravel silt clay and sandstone in scenarios with varying horizontal hydraulic conductivity an anisotropy ratio kz kh of 0 1 was used for all layers horizontal hydraulic conductivity was 11 m d in vertical hydraulic conductivity scenarios hydraulic conductivity range was chosen based on a calibrated hydraulic conductivity distribution map rossman et al 2018 for the study area since the modeled heads are less sensitive to a change in vertical hydraulic conductivity of the model layers than to a change in horizontal conductivity a greater order of change in kz was preferred 2 4 4 river conductance scenarios riverbed hydraulic conductivity was simulated by assigning i uniform riverbed conductivity values 0 05 0 5 5 50 m d and ii increasing or decreasing riverbed conductivity values from west to east fig 3d riverbed conductivities were chosen within the range of values measured by humphrey et al 2020 interaction of groundwater and river was simulated by the river package which is a head dependent flux boundary harbaugh 2005 riverbed conductance criv relates the flux between the river and the aquifer to the head difference between aquifer and the river stage at a given river cell eq 4 4 qriv c r i v h r i v h where qriv is the flux between the aquifer and the river l3t 1 hriv is the river stage l criv is the riverbed hydraulic conductance l2t 1 and h is the head in the cell below the river reach l the riverbed hydraulic conductance can be calculated as follows 5 criv k l w m where l is the length of the river reach l w is the width of the river reach l m is the thickness of the riverbed l and k is the hydraulic conductivity of the riverbed material lt 1 2 4 5 statistical analysis of simulation results the shapes of ttds obtained from different recharge aquifer and riverbed heterogeneity scenarios were compared using descriptive statistics including higher moments of distributions and non parametric kolmogorov smirnov statistical test ks chakravarti et al 1967 the ks test can be used to calculate the maximum absolute difference between two cumulative distributions dn at different significance levels e g 0 05 or 0 01 as follows 6 d n m a x m 1 x m 2 x where m 1 x a n d m 2 x are two empirical distributions of random variable x also dn is between 0 and 1 and approaches 0 when two cumulative distributions get closer to each other 3 results and discussion 3 1 baseline model scenario simulated water levels for the uncalibrated groundwater flow model scenario were generally in good agreement with regional groundwater table contours conservation and survey division of university of nebraska lincoln 2019b except the western part of the model domain where hundreds of small wetlands and lakes reside fig 4 this might be explained using uniform recharge in the baseline model which does not represent the actual recharge distribution in these areas recharge is minimal or negative in the western portion of the model domain fig 3c also the spatial variations in the aquifer parameters control the head distributions throughout the flow domain saturated aquifer thickness obtained from the baseline model scenario varied between 150 5 m and 312 9 m with a mean of 227 2 m throughout the model domain the simulated transit times increased from upstream to downstream the particle tracking sites in the stream ranged from 0 1 to 10 581 years table s3 based on length of streamlines fig 4 and corresponding transit times table s3 particles discharging at upstream sites 6 km 13 km and 21 km intermediate site 40 km and downstream sites 99 km and 158 km can be characterized by local intermediate and deeper regional flow systems respectively in the upstream particle tracking sites at 6 13 and 21 km similar shallow particle streamlines and distributions were observed and transit times ranged from 0 1 to 2 9 years small transit times might be a result of the short local flow paths to the streams haitjema 1995 the intermediate particle tracking site of 40 km had transit times ranging from 0 1 to 150 years with a bimodal distribution fig 5 the highest coefficient of variation cv of 101 91 was also observed at this particle tracking site the longest transit times were observed at the downstream particle sites of 99 km and 158 km study sites which are located downstream of the confluence of the upper middle and northern branches of the umlr transit times ranged from 203 to 607 years and 2265 and 10582 years for 99 km and 158 km respectively particles at the furthest downstream site of 158 km had a long tailed ttd with relatively higher positive skewness due to the fewer old groundwater particles traveling through longer and deeper flow paths furthermore moving from upstream to downstream the shape of the ttds gets closer to an exponential distribution which also may indicate that the furthest downstream discharge point receives groundwater from relatively larger portions of the aquifer in the model domain gusyev et al 2014 calculated analytical mtt of 1245 years from equation 2 also suggests that numerical mtt is getting closer to an exponential mtt from upstream to downstream sampling points in the watershed haitjema 1995 3 2 recharge aquifer and riverbed heterogeneity scenarios particle tracking simulation nomenclature for recharge aquifer and riverbed heterogeneity scenarios is provided in table 2 including the base case scenario and considering six stream sites the modeling effort yielded 120 different mtts and ttds the related transit time statistics calculated for each parameter scenario are shown in tables s3 s8 and fig s9 in the following sections we focus specifically on the mtts and ttds from the recharge aquifer and riverbed heterogeneity scenarios that yielded the greatest deviation from the baseline scenario fig 6 and table s8 to highlight important model parameters to consider in future particle tracking studies in similar hydrogeologic and climatic environments the sensitivity of the ttd to each scenario was evaluated based on the deviation from the ttd of the baseline scenario the level of variation between the ttd of each scenario and the baseline scenario was quantified by maximum distance dn test score which was obtained from a two sample kolmogorov smirnov test calculated at a significance level of 0 05 fig 6 and table s8 the calculated dn scores varied from 0 and 1 where scores closer to 0 indicates a better match between two ttd distributions the ttd curve of the scenarios which significantly dn test score 0 5 in fig 6 caused a shift from the baseline scenario were plotted for each study site fig 5 and discussed in the following section a wide range of groundwater transit times was observed across the model domain with an increase in mtt from upstream to downstream under each scenario e g fig 5 see also fig s9 and table s3 s7 upstream particle tracking sites at 6 km 13 km and 21 km were dominated by local flow paths with short transit times intermediate and deeper flow paths resulted in longer transit times at 40 km 99 km and 158 km in general transit times were more sensitive to a variation in riverbed hydraulic conductivity at upstream study sites mean dn of 0 42 and 0 29 for upstream and downstream respectively table s8 and fig 6 uniform recharge scenarios had the most influence on the shape of the ttds in the downstream sites mean dn of 0 24 and 0 61 for upstream and downstream respectively table s8 and fig 6 doubled recharge 2r scenario was the scenario that most consistently caused significant deviation from the baseline scenario mean dn 0 67 in five out of six stream sites figs 5 and 6 this might be explained by the significant impact of variation in groundwater recharge on hydraulic gradients which in turn affected the length of the streamlines and corresponding transit times in the unconfined aquifer system 3 3 upstream particle tracking sites 6 km 13 km and 21 km groundwater discharge to streams was dominated by local shallow flow paths with short transit times in the upstream sites of 6 km 13 km and 21 km in each recharge and aquifer riverbed scenario the maximum mtt was around 7 years fig s9 and tables s3 s7 observing shorter travel times at upstream particle tracking sites may be due to the partial penetration of the stream network in the headwaters of the watershed where intermediate and deeper flow paths did not converge into the stream cells these cells act like weak sinks permitting the underflow of groundwater beneath the river cells in the numerical model abrams et al 2012 as explained below ttds for upstream sites are significantly different under riverbed hydraulic conductivity doubled recharge horizontal hydraulic conductivity and porosity scenarios fig 6 and fig s6 especially under the lowest uniform riverbed hydraulic conductivity scenario 0 05 m d the ttd curves shifted towards older ages for lower riverbed hydraulic conductivity the connection between the aquifer and the stream is weakened lackey et al 2015 this weakened connection results in variations in local hydraulic gradients which in turn might affect the shorter flow paths discharging younger water at these sites goderniaux et al 2013 for constant aquifer thickness an increase in recharge close to the outlet tends to generate much younger groundwater where the velocity is higher for the shorter flow paths close to the discharge point etcheverry 2001 leray et al 2016 leray et al 2019 however the doubled recharge 2r scenario resulted in a shift towards larger transit times which is counterintuitive but can be explained by the large number of flooded cells where simulated head is above the top of the cell that altered the local flow paths and generated longer flow paths at the upstream of these stream sites fig s10 this artificial condition occurs due to the unrealistic amount of recharge values especially in the upstream part of the model domain which acts as intermediate and regional recharge areas generating longer flow paths with larger transit times with the vertically increasing horizontal hydraulic conductivity scenario where lower conductivities are in the upper model layers the ttd curve was shifted to slightly older ages this result is consistent with etcheverry and perrochet 2000 which found that when low hydraulic conductivity is in the upper model layers the ttd shifts to older transit times because low hydraulic conductivity acts as a retardation factor similar decreases in transit times were reported in previous studies where hydraulic conductivities increased horizontally and or vertically etcheverry and perrochet 2000 leray et al 2019 edington and poeter 2006 haitjema 1995 the porosity scenarios also have a strong effect on the transit times where an increasing vertical trend lower porosity in the upper layers resulted in a shift towards younger ages in the upstream particle tracking sites effects of porosity can be explained by the higher flow velocities in the upper layers resulting in a shift to shorter transit times since the porosity is inversely proportional to the average linear groundwater velocity 3 4 intermediate particle tracking site 40 km the mtts range from 10 years to 397 years in the 40 km site which is located just upstream of the confluence of the upper middle and northern branches of the umlr the ttds were generally bimodal with very short 1 year and long transit times e g uni n i and 0 5r scenarios in fig 5 see also fig s9 and tables s3 s7 intermediate flow paths resulted in a spread in the ttds and larger coefficient of variations in the mtts were observed at this particle tracking site figures 6 and s9 and tables s3 and s7 unlike the upstream sites the 40 km site yielded particles with older transit times which follow longer streamlines the increasing horizontal hydraulic conductivity scenario resulted in a shift towards older ages as well as the highest ks test score at this site for geological settings where the hydraulic conductivity of the aquifer material increases with depth zlotnik et al 2011 concluded that local and intermediate depths flow systems disappear and or are weakened and deeper groundwater circulation occurs where the water recharging the aquifer is pulled downward to the bottom portions of the flow domain riverbed hydraulic conductivity scenarios still had a large effect on the shape of the ttds and the mtts where a lower conductivity 0 05 md 1 resulted in a shift towards older ages due to the reduced connection between the stream and aquifer however in contrast to the upstream study sites the effect of doubled and halved recharge was greater at 40 km the increasing porosity scenario lower porosity in the upper layers resulted in a shift towards shorter transit time and the shape of the ttd curve remained similar to the baseline scenario fig 5 overall variations in the shape of the ttds at this site might be related to spatial proximity to the middle branch of the umlr and the local stream density which in turn affects the flow regime and the length of the particle streamlines discharging at this site 3 5 downstream particle tracking sites 99 km and 158 km in the downstream particle tracking sites 99 km and 158 km sites recharge and aquifer scenarios significantly changed the shape of the ttd curves which were generally dominated by the particles traveling with intermediate and deep flow paths originating near the western northern and southern boundaries of the flow model the simulated mtts ranged from 820 to 2192 years and 2133 to 7968 years at 99 km and 158 km respectively tables s3 and s9 the ttd curves generally had leptokurtic characteristics with long tails which is due to the fewer particles with longer streamlines and longer transit times fig 5 the largest positive skewness 1 was also observed in this particle tracking site doubled and halved recharge scenarios resulted in the most significant change in the ttds and the mtts at these sites fig 6 and fig s8 increased recharge e g 2r scenario scenario caused a shift towards shorter transit times while reducing the range of the transit times this behavior in the ttd characteristics is parallel to the findings of previous modeling studies that assumed uniform aquifer thickness and recharge conditions haitjema 1995 etcheverry 2001 leray et al 2016 leray et al 2019 the overall behavior of increasing mtt with decreased recharge rate fig 7 was also consistent with lumped parameter models e g exponential model vogel 1967 solomon et al 2006 halved recharge 0 5r on the other hand resulted in a shift towards older ages due to weakening of local flow paths close to the particle tracking sites as well as the slower input to a certain volume caused a longer residence time engdahl and maxwell 2015 also obtained a similar ttd shift to older ages when they decreased the recharge by 50 in their numerical groundwater model additionally under low recharge conditions the ttd curve shifts to longer transit times with decreasing level of stream and aquifer interaction due to the weakening of local flow paths goderniaux et al 2013 the downstream transects were also affected less by the flooded and dried model cells in the upstream part of the model domain under 0 5r and 2r recharge scenarios unlike at the upstream sites riverbed conductivity scenarios had less impact on the ttds at 99 km and 158 km fig 8 the ttds were more sensitive to a variation in aquifer hydraulic conductivity than the riverbed conductivity in these downstream particle tracking sites figs 5 and 6 similarly kalbus et al 2009 reported that the aquifer heterogeneity plays a more important role than the riverbed heterogeneity in groundwater discharge to streams overall shapes of the ttd curves fig 6 are closer to an exponential distribution moving from 99 km to 158 km i e as spatial scale increased where the discharge point is closer to the outlet of the ground watershed under a uniform recharge as discussed in haitjema 1995 4 implications and future work in this study the steady state 3d groundwater flow model utilized an actual catchment geometry together with hypothetical recharge aquifer and riverbed parameter scenarios the particle tracking was based on the advective transport of groundwater parcels in the flow domain simulations indicate significant change in the transit times in most of the simulation scenarios this age shift from the baseline scenario was also more prominent in the ttds than in the mtts e g fig 6 and fig s8 the results of the particle tracking simulations also showed that the transit times were not only controlled by different model parameters such as recharge or aquifer s hydraulic parameters but also the local and regional scale groundwater conditions at different particle tracking sites for example the upstream discharge sites were dominated by local and shallow flow system in which the effects of disconnection between aquifer and stream e g a very low riverbed conductivity scenario was more significant due to the disappearing of local hydraulic gradients at these stream sites however in the downstream sites groundwater discharge is mainly dominated by intermediate and deeper flow systems and affected less by the riverbed conductivity since the regional groundwater flow direction and the longer streamlines were not significantly affected the ks test scores fig 6 and fig s8 also suggest that the ttds at the study sites were less sensitive to spatially varying recharge scenarios e g modis estimated or lateral recharge gradient scenario than a uniform change in the magnitude of recharge e g halved or doubled recharge outliers in transit times were generally observed at sites 40 km and 158 km fig s9 it can be explained by very short and very long streamlines modeled based on the groundwater velocity distributions and the particle tracking algorithm that allows a particle to terminate within a boundary cell in the model domain this makes a small number of particles terminate faster or slower than most of the particles for example at 158 km some of the particles are traveling with very long regional flow paths without being terminated at a boundary cell thus reaching at the very eastern part of the model domain fig 4 for any hydrological model uncertainty exists in each input yet there are finite resources available for data collection though the sensitivity of model parameters in other study sites may not have the same results as ours the results of this study can help guide future modeling ttd studies in the identification of the most influential model parameters this information can help them prioritize their data collection efforts overall the results indicate that the sensitivity of the model parameterization on the ttds should also be investigated by considering the spatial characteristics of the regional aquifer system this emphasizes the importance of using local calibration targets such as groundwater tracer ages in the numerical model calibration process considering the actual geological heterogeneity of the aquifer system by using a 3d model will also improve the accuracy of the particle streamlines and related ttd predictions the ttds also were affected by the accuracy of the particle tracking of the coarse numerical model grids 125 m that do not represent the actual stream area or geometry in the watersheds abrams 2013 this regional scale grid discretization also limited the understanding of the link between the topography and dynamics of groundwater flow movement ttds due to the hummocky topography in the nsh the local grid refinement and or small scale numerical model development especially in the target sites e g particle tracking groundwater sampling sites may eventually increase the accuracy of the predictions of the future numerical models this study was an important step toward understanding the potential hydrological mechanisms driving discrepancies between the ttds obtained from numerical model and groundwater age dating tracer studies in the umlr watershed in future research comparison of calibrated model ttds and age dating tracer ttds can refine the understanding of the hydrological processes and discrepancies between the different estimation methods collectively these studies will provide guidance for future particle tracking simulations both for incorporating environmental tracer information into groundwater model calibration and for using particle tracking as a preliminary guide when designing field tracer studies 5 conclusions the ttds of groundwater discharges at six different river sites in the umlr watershed were modeled using coupled numerical groundwater flow modeling modflow usg and particle tracking modpath 3du under varying recharge aquifer and riverbed heterogeneity scenarios obtained mtts and ttds were compared with a baseline scenario using the real aquifer geometry and represented with five vertical layers with uniform recharge aquifer and stream parameters simulation results showed how the mtts and ttds spatially vary in response to these parameter scenarios with a clear upstream to downstream increasing trend in the umlr watershed maximum mtts range between 7 years and 7968 years upstream particle tracking sites were characterized with local and shallow flow paths with short transit times while downstream sites were dominated by intermediate and deeper flow paths with significantly longer transit times furthermore the effect of each scenario on ttds and mtts also varied at each particle tracking site in the upstream particles tracking sites transit times were generally more sensitive to a change in riverbed hydraulic conductivity while increasing and decreasing uniform recharge had more control on the shape of the ttds in the downstream sites in the flow domain results showed that the different model parameters were important for controlling the ttds for different parts of the watershed where the particle travel paths vary depending on the conditions of local and

2518,groundwater transit time distributions ttds the travel times through the aquifer from recharge at the water table to discharge at the surface water body provide critical information on the timescales of hydrologic response of subsurface flow systems we investigated the effects of spatial patterns of recharge aquifer heterogeneity and systematic variation in riverbed hydraulic conductivity on the mean transit times mtts and ttds of groundwater discharge to the upper middle loup river umlr and headwaters using a 3d steady state modflow usg modpathd3du model this 5436 km2 watershed overlies the high plains aquifer in the sand hills of nebraska usa modeled mtts differed by up to three orders of magnitude from upstream to downstream in a 158 km section of the umlr under varying recharge aquifer and riverbed heterogeneity scenarios the simulated mtts ranged from 1 to 397 years for upstream sites and 820 to 7968 years for the downstream sites the ttds at upstream sites were dominated by young groundwater from shallow flow paths and were sensitive to changes in riverbed hydraulic conductivity recharge parameterization had greater influence on the shape of the ttds and magnitude of mtts at the downstream sites where much older groundwater discharged to the umlr overall spatial trends in transit times under varying model scenarios provided important information

made available on request 1 introduction modeling groundwater mean transit times mtts and transit time distributions ttds is critical for characterizing the hydrological responses of subsurface flow systems jing et al 2019 and estimating travel times for contaminants that discharge from aquifers basu et al 2012 ilampooranan et al 2019 leray et al 2019 browne and guldan 2005 modica et al 1998 kennedy et al 2009 gilmore et al 2016 groundwater ttds are especially effective tools for evaluating lag times between the input of non point source pollution and its discharge to groundwater wells and streams different analytical lumped parameter models lpms and coupled numerical groundwater models and particle tracking algorithms can be used to simulate groundwater ttds lumped parameter models are characterized by the ttd functions whose parameters can be calibrated by the experimental observations of tracers transported between recharge input and discharge output areas małoszewski and zuber 1982 maloszewski 2000 numerical groundwater and transport models are mainly based on the solution of the groundwater flow and transport equations in which the transit times could be governed by advection only conditions i e kinematic age modica et al 1998 maxwell et al 2016 eberts et al 2012 basu et al 2012 gusyev et al 2014 or advection along with other transport processes such as dispersion diffusion and reaction goode 1996 varni and carrera 1998 the latter is based on equations derived from both residence time distribution concepts and mass conservation principles applied to conceptual age mass rather than just kinematic ages based on average linear groundwater velocities the effects of spatially varying recharge or aquifer hydraulic parameters on the shape of ttds have been investigated in multiple studies abrams and haitjema 2018 jing et al 2019 leray et al 2019 rumynin et al 2019 sanford 2011 edington and poeter 2006 the effects of heterogeneity in riverbed conductivity on fluxes between aquifer and river have been studied e g irvine et al 2012 kurtz et al 2013 tang et al 2017 however effects of riverbed hydraulic conductivity on the groundwater ttds have not been explored engdahl and maxwell 2015 studied the effects of recharge variation induced by climate change on ttds which had significant changes between different climate scenarios abrams and haitjema 2018 simulated ttds using an lpm and modflow modpath and concluded that the parameters such as saturated thickness porosity and groundwater recharge control the shape of the exponential ttds a catchment scale groundwater ttd study carried out by jing et al 2019 showed that the shape of ttds is strongly dependent on groundwater recharge rates and sensitive to recharge spatial patterns effects of non uniform aquifer structure and groundwater recharge conditions on residence time distributions were investigated by leray et al 2019 using an analytical modeling approach their study found that the shape of the residence time distribution is significantly modified by including the aquifer structure and recharge gradients in their semi analytical model etcheverry and perrochet 2000 linked the asymmetry and multimodality in the ttds to the aquifer geometry and heterogeneity in the groundwater flow velocities where they modeled a regional multilayered aquifer using an analytical method understanding the vertical variations in hydraulic properties of aquifers is critical for explaining the groundwater flow dynamics dietze and dietrich 2012 an increase of hydraulic conductivity with depth in some stratigraphic sequences results from depositional processes in sand bed braided rivers zlotnik et al 2011 on the contrary a decrease of hydraulic conductivity with depth in consolidated systems is generally attributed to spatial variation in fracture intensity where the fractures in the shallow crust deformed in response to stresses induced by earthquake waves earth tides tectonic stresses and groundwater pumping earnest and boutt 2014 and also compaction due to the greater total stress fetter 2001 p 89 cardenas and jiang 2010 state that the exponentially decreasing regional scale heterogeneity enhances the power law residence time distribution by increasing the deeper slow flowing zone and accelerating the fluxes near the land surface furthermore rumynin et al 2019 investigated the effects of hydraulic conductivity anisotropy and depth decay coefficients on groundwater flow and ttds using computational simulations they concluded that the relationship between ttds and the monotonically increasing and decreasing hydraulic conductivity may exhibit non monotonic behavior edington and poeter 2006 investigated the effects of vertical heterogeneity on travel times using a modflow modpath model where they obtained the geological model using a stratigraphy simulator fluvsim their study concluded that groundwater travel times were younger under a low accommodation e g low amount of space available for sediment accumulation stratigraphy and older under high accommodation stratigraphy sanford 2011 also found that the spatial variation in recharge and hydraulic conductivity makes a significant difference in age distributions but the sensitivity of age to vertical hydraulic conductivity is not clear since it is generally poorly constrained in modeling studies past theoretical studies indicate that simulated transit times are sensitive to spatial heterogeneity in recharge aquifer structure and likely streambed conductance however there is lack of site specific studies that systematically account for the effect of heterogeneity of these parameters on groundwater ttd modeled for multiple streambed discharge points at a watershed scale the objective of our study was to evaluate the effects of spatial complexity of recharge structural heterogeneity of aquifer characteristics and systematic variation in riverbed hydraulic conductivity on the ttds and mtts in six river sites along a 158 km section of the upper middle loup river umlr in the nebraska sand hills this study yields insight into model sensitivity of ttds at different spatial scales ranging between 14 and 5436 km2 that can aid future groundwater studies 2 methods modeling code modflow usg panday et al 2012 was used to simulate three dimensional steady state groundwater flow in the upper middle loup river umlr watershed fig 1 after a base model scenario uniform recharge aquifer and streambed parameters fig 1 step 3a hypothetical recharge and aquifer parameter scenarios were applied in the model fig 1 steps 3b and 3c respectively finally the role of the magnitude and heterogeneity of riverbed conductance was investigated fig 1 step d for each scenario groundwater ttds from backward particle tracking were examined step 4 through step 6 to determine the effect of the different recharge and hydrogeologic heterogeneity scenarios on ttds at aquifer discharge points i e six study sites fig 1 particle tracking was accomplished using modpath3du code muffels et al 2016 unstructured grid discretization was chosen to increase the model performance and the computational efficiency by refining only river cells in the flow domain modpath3du was selected as a particle tracking code since it can handle high spatial variability of flow fields in the individual unstructured cells where the particle tracking scheme is not susceptible to weak sinks craig et al 2020 2 1 study site this study focuses on systematic evaluation of hydrologic processes that potentially control the characteristics of groundwater ttds of groundwater discharging to the umlr the umlr watershed which covers an area of 5436 km2 in the nebraska sand hills drains to the united states geological station usgs stream gage station 06775500 fig 2 the sand hills are composed of vegetated sand dunes radiocarbon studies indicate dune mobility at various times during the holocene epoch schmeisser mckean et al 2015 loope and swinehart 2000 most of the sand hills are used for grazing cattle with pasture making up 94 of the study area dappen et al 2007 average annual temperature is 10 c and there is a large precipitation gradient from west to east 400 mm to 700 mm respectively across the sand hills with a mean annual precipitation and groundwater recharge of 533 mm and 73 mm respectively szilagyi and jozsa 2013 the aquifer in the study area is part of the northern high plains aquifer composed of one or more hydraulically connected geological units of quaternary and late tertiary age gutentag et al 1984 the uppermost geological unit in the sand hills is the holocene eolian dunes and pleistocene sand gravel silt and clay which overlies the pliocene sands and gravels korus et al 2011 sand and sandstone of miocene and oligocene units ogallala group comprise the major aquifer unit in the sand hills korus et al 2011 the base of the aquifer system is the siltstones of the miocene ogallala and oligocene arikaree groups saturated aquifer thickness varies from near zero to 314 m with an average of 161 m rossman et al 2018 there are very few artificial aquifer stresses such as pumping to cause transient groundwater flow conditions as cropland makes up only 0 23 of the model area and population is sparse the stream discharge in the sand hills is stable with ratio of low to high flow q95 q5 of only 1 41 with a q95 of 16 3 m3s 1 and q5 of 11 5 m3s 1 hobza and schepers 2018 q95 and q5 are the flow in m3s 1 which was equaled or exceeded for 95 and 5 of the flow record respectively riverbed hydraulic conductivity k varies significantly throughout the study area humphrey et al 2020 measured riverbed k using

with the groundwater vistas 7 rumbaugh and rumbaugh 2017 graphical user interface gui was used to simulate three dimensional steady state flow this code uses a finite difference numerical approximation method to solve the governing partial differential flow equation in a discretized flow domain the area of the flow domain was determined as 5436 km2 based on the physical boundary conditions of the aquifer system within the watershed the base of the aquifer was set as a no flow boundary which represents the low hydraulic conductivity siltstone and claystone levels of the oligocene age white river group we used the base of the aquifer contour map which was developed using available borehole datasets conservation and survey division of university of nebraska lincoln 2019a a 10 m digital elevation model dem was used to represent the top surface of the model domain usgs 2017 western southern and northern boundaries were chosen as no flow boundaries which follow the groundwater divides across the flow domain based on a regional groundwater table map conservation and survey division of university of nebraska lincoln 2019b a constant head boundary was assigned to represent the eastern model boundary based on the potentiometric head contours of the same regional groundwater table map an unstructured quadtree grid refinement panday et al 2013 was used for horizontal discretization of the model domain to create finer grids over and in the vicinity of the streams the quadtree grids formed only 5 of the entire numerical model with two different grid sizes of 250 m and 125 m while the parent grid size remained 500 m aquifer thickness was divided into five layers to simulate the particle streamlines within the three dimensional flow domain model layers were assigned as unconfined where the transmissivity is calculated from the saturated thickness and horizontal hydraulic conductivity of the model layer since long term groundwater levels and discharge show very little variation rossman et al 2018 a steady state simulation was used 2 3 particle tracking simulations the 5 layer regional groundwater flow model was developed to run the particle tracking simulations under steady state conditions a particle tracking code calculates the velocities and tracks the movement of imaginary particles using modeled head distribution hydraulic conductivity and effective porosity anderson et al 2015 these particles travel with the average linear groundwater velocity darcy flux divided by effective porosity which represents the advective transport of the solutes the principal components of the velocity vectors in the model cells are calculated with an interpolation method and then the particle streamlines are traced using a particle movement technique derivations of the related particle tracking equations can be found in muffels et al 2016 the lag time effect of the unsaturated zone see szilagyi et al 2011 szilagyi et al 2003 on the ttds was neglected throughout the simulations since the particle tracking clock starts at the potentiometric surface of the aquifer travel times for each numerical model scenario were simulated using a backward particle tracking scheme equal numbers of hypothetical particles located on the river boundary grids representing the different sampling sites were traced backward to their initial recharge locations modpath 3du output files containing the particle travel times and streamlines obtained from each scenario were then post processed in arcgis and coding environments the flux weighted ttds for each streambed sampling site was represented by the recharge weighted cumulative frequency distribution cfrd of the transit times and the weighted mtts were calculated using the following equation kennedy et al 2009 gilmore et al 2016 1 mtt i 1 n r i t i i 1 n r i where n is the total number of particles t i t is the particle transit time and r i l t is the recharge flux at the cell where the particle originates an mtt based on the exponential lpm was also calculated for comparison with the numerical mtts using the following eq 2 derived by haitjema 1995 2 m t t nh n where n is the uniform porosity n l t is the uniform recharge and h l is the average saturated aquifer thickness which is assumed to be constant the nh term represents the volume of the groundwater per unit area of aquifer l3 l2 and n is the volumetric replenishment of groundwater into the aquifer per unit area of aquifer l3 l2t since both h and n are expressed per unit area 1 l2 an exact domain surface area is not required to calculate mtt 2 4 modeling scenarios 2 4 1 baseline scenario the baseline numerical model was run under uniform recharge and aquifer parameterization an average recharge value of 55 mm yr 1 was obtained from modis derived net groundwater recharge map szilagyi and jozsa 2013 and applied to the uppermost active layer in the model domain hydraulic conductivity used average value from houston et al 2013 which used a thickness weighted average of the dataset of hydraulic conductivity and specific yield for the entire high plains aquifer calculated average uniform horizontal hydraulic conductivity kx of 11 m d was assigned to all active model cells vertical hydraulic conductivity kz was assumed to be uniform and 1 1 md 1 0 1 of the kx a vertical anisotropy ratio of 0 1 was considered to be conservative for the purpose of the modeling based on the physical characteristics of the unconsolidated and bedrock aquifers the anisotropy ratios for the similar units were generally reported in the range of 0 01 and 0 5 domenico and schwartz 1990 todd and mays 2005 an average uniform porosity of 0 3 was chosen given the nature of the heterogeneous aquifer materials consisting of plio quaternary and pleistocene aged fine to medium sands and miocene aged consolidated sandstones fetter 2001 p 79 a uniform riverbed hydraulic conductivity value of 0 5 m d 1 within the range of field measurements was chosen to get a better match between simulated heads and regional groundwater table counter map of the study area the model setup for baseline groundwater flow model and particle tracking simulation scenario is given in table s1 2 4 2 recharge heterogeneity scenarios uniform and spatially varying recharge conditions were considered uniform recharge scenarios were chosen as 50 75 125 and 200 of baseline recharge of 55 mm y 1 four different scenarios of spatial variability were simulated general west to east gradient with increasing and decreasing patterns a lateral gradient where recharge is lower near the stream due to higher evapotranspiration and modis based distributed net recharge model in each scenario aquifer and river properties remained identical also each spatially varying recharge scenario used the same total recharge as the baseline scenario 55 mm yr 1 in the first two scenarios with spatially varying recharge the model domain was divided into five equal areas with different recharge rates fig 3 a in scenario 1 recharge increased from west to east and in scenario 2 recharge decreased from west to east calculated recharge values for the zones varied from 27 4 mm yr 1 to 82 1 mm yr 1 the third scenario was based on a lateral gradient along the channel where recharge was lower near the stream due to higher evapotranspiration lateral extent of the stream buffers was determined based on analysis of the normalized difference vegetation index ndvi for the study site fig 3b ndvi is an index based on the reflectance measurements in the visible and near infrared regions of the spectra to examine the dynamics of vegetation deering 1978 in arid and semi arid regions groundwater is a critical source for plant growth and transpiration naumburg et al 2005 wang et al 2011 seeyan et al 2014 thus this may lead to a reduction in young groundwater discharging to streams a recent study parizi et al 2020 concluded that when ndvi was 0 18 groundwater recharge started decreasing with increasing ndvi in their semi arid study area given the similar climatic conditions and high mean ndvi 0 32 in our study area we used this assumption in the lateral gradient recharge scenario multispectral satellite images from landsat tm oli were used to calculate the ndvi 3 n d v i n i r r e d n i r r e d where nir is the reflection in the near infrared spectrum and red is the reflection in the red ranges of the spectrum the red and near infrared bands of landsat 8 surface reflectance images were used to calculate the ndvi myneni et al 1995 in google earth engine the satellite images were cloud masked using pixel quality values vermote et al 2016 and were filtered for cloud cover 5 to represent the growing season average ndvi between may and july were calculated from 2013 to 2020 the ndvi values were then aggregated within the river and non river boundary condition cells the numerical model cells within the stream buffer zones were assigned the highest average ndvi values while the cells outside the stream were given the lowest average ndvi values the total volume of recharge 8 15x105 m3 d 1 was then divided into river and non river boundary cells based on the ndvi ratio recharge values for the stream buffer zones and the rest of the model domain cells were calculated as 15 42 mm yr 1 and 57 76 mm yr 1 respectively fig 3b the fourth recharge scenario used modis derived distributed net groundwater recharge data with a 1 km resolution szilagyi and jozsa 2013 fig 3c calculated recharge ranged between 140 mm yr 1 and 170 00 mm yr 1 the minimum recharge occurred in the western part of the study area where there are multiple lakes and wetlands and evapotranspiration exceeds precipitation 2 4 3 aquifer heterogeneity scenarios effects of regional scale aquifer heterogeneity on the ttds were investigated using six hypothetical aquifer scenarios where porosity and horizontal and vertical hydraulic conductivity values increased three scenarios or decreased three scenarios with the model layer numbers table s2 for increase and decrease scenarios parameter values for five different layers were assigned in increasing and decreasing order in the case of increasing porosity for example the shallowest layer layer 1 was set to 0 1 with increasing porosity values for each layer up to 0 5 for the deepest layer layer 5 table s2 porosity range used in the aquifer heterogeneity scenarios was determined based on the wide range of consolidated and unconsolidated lithological units unconsolidated sand gravel silt clay and sandstone in scenarios with varying horizontal hydraulic conductivity an anisotropy ratio kz kh of 0 1 was used for all layers horizontal hydraulic conductivity was 11 m d in vertical hydraulic conductivity scenarios hydraulic conductivity range was chosen based on a calibrated hydraulic conductivity distribution map rossman et al 2018 for the study area since the modeled heads are less sensitive to a change in vertical hydraulic conductivity of the model layers than to a change in horizontal conductivity a greater order of change in kz was preferred 2 4 4 river conductance scenarios riverbed hydraulic conductivity was simulated by assigning i uniform riverbed conductivity values 0 05 0 5 5 50 m d and ii increasing or decreasing riverbed conductivity values from west to east fig 3d riverbed conductivities were chosen within the range of values measured by humphrey et al 2020 interaction of groundwater and river was simulated by the river package which is a head dependent flux boundary harbaugh 2005 riverbed conductance criv relates the flux between the river and the aquifer to the head difference between aquifer and the river stage at a given river cell eq 4 4 qriv c r i v h r i v h where qriv is the flux between the aquifer and the river l3t 1 hriv is the river stage l criv is the riverbed hydraulic conductance l2t 1 and h is the head in the cell below the river reach l the riverbed hydraulic conductance can be calculated as follows 5 criv k l w m where l is the length of the river reach l w is the width of the river reach l m is the thickness of the riverbed l and k is the hydraulic conductivity of the riverbed material lt 1 2 4 5 statistical analysis of simulation results the shapes of ttds obtained from different recharge aquifer and riverbed heterogeneity scenarios were compared using descriptive statistics including higher moments of distributions and non parametric kolmogorov smirnov statistical test ks chakravarti et al 1967 the ks test can be used to calculate the maximum absolute difference between two cumulative distributions dn at different significance levels e g 0 05 or 0 01 as follows 6 d n m a x m 1 x m 2 x where m 1 x a n d m 2 x are two empirical distributions of random variable x also dn is between 0 and 1 and approaches 0 when two cumulative distributions get closer to each other 3 results and discussion 3 1 baseline model scenario simulated water levels for the uncalibrated groundwater flow model scenario were generally in good agreement with regional groundwater table contours conservation and survey division of university of nebraska lincoln 2019b except the western part of the model domain where hundreds of small wetlands and lakes reside fig 4 this might be explained using uniform recharge in the baseline model which does not represent the actual recharge distribution in these areas recharge is minimal or negative in the western portion of the model domain fig 3c also the spatial variations in the aquifer parameters control the head distributions throughout the flow domain saturated aquifer thickness obtained from the baseline model scenario varied between 150 5 m and 312 9 m with a mean of 227 2 m throughout the model domain the simulated transit times increased from upstream to downstream the particle tracking sites in the stream ranged from 0 1 to 10 581 years table s3 based on length of streamlines fig 4 and corresponding transit times table s3 particles discharging at upstream sites 6 km 13 km and 21 km intermediate site 40 km and downstream sites 99 km and 158 km can be characterized by local intermediate and deeper regional flow systems respectively in the upstream particle tracking sites at 6 13 and 21 km similar shallow particle streamlines and distributions were observed and transit times ranged from 0 1 to 2 9 years small transit times might be a result of the short local flow paths to the streams haitjema 1995 the intermediate particle tracking site of 40 km had transit times ranging from 0 1 to 150 years with a bimodal distribution fig 5 the highest coefficient of variation cv of 101 91 was also observed at this particle tracking site the longest transit times were observed at the downstream particle sites of 99 km and 158 km study sites which are located downstream of the confluence of the upper middle and northern branches of the umlr transit times ranged from 203 to 607 years and 2265 and 10582 years for 99 km and 158 km respectively particles at the furthest downstream site of 158 km had a long tailed ttd with relatively higher positive skewness due to the fewer old groundwater particles traveling through longer and deeper flow paths furthermore moving from upstream to downstream the shape of the ttds gets closer to an exponential distribution which also may indicate that the furthest downstream discharge point receives groundwater from relatively larger portions of the aquifer in the model domain gusyev et al 2014 calculated analytical mtt of 1245 years from equation 2 also suggests that numerical mtt is getting closer to an exponential mtt from upstream to downstream sampling points in the watershed haitjema 1995 3 2 recharge aquifer and riverbed heterogeneity scenarios particle tracking simulation nomenclature for recharge aquifer and riverbed heterogeneity scenarios is provided in table 2 including the base case scenario and considering six stream sites the modeling effort yielded 120 different mtts and ttds the related transit time statistics calculated for each parameter scenario are shown in tables s3 s8 and fig s9 in the following sections we focus specifically on the mtts and ttds from the recharge aquifer and riverbed heterogeneity scenarios that yielded the greatest deviation from the baseline scenario fig 6 and table s8 to highlight important model parameters to consider in future particle tracking studies in similar hydrogeologic and climatic environments the sensitivity of the ttd to each scenario was evaluated based on the deviation from the ttd of the baseline scenario the level of variation between the ttd of each scenario and the baseline scenario was quantified by maximum distance dn test score which was obtained from a two sample kolmogorov smirnov test calculated at a significance level of 0 05 fig 6 and table s8 the calculated dn scores varied from 0 and 1 where scores closer to 0 indicates a better match between two ttd distributions the ttd curve of the scenarios which significantly dn test score 0 5 in fig 6 caused a shift from the baseline scenario were plotted for each study site fig 5 and discussed in the following section a wide range of groundwater transit times was observed across the model domain with an increase in mtt from upstream to downstream under each scenario e g fig 5 see also fig s9 and table s3 s7 upstream particle tracking sites at 6 km 13 km and 21 km were dominated by local flow paths with short transit times intermediate and deeper flow paths resulted in longer transit times at 40 km 99 km and 158 km in general transit times were more sensitive to a variation in riverbed hydraulic conductivity at upstream study sites mean dn of 0 42 and 0 29 for upstream and downstream respectively table s8 and fig 6 uniform recharge scenarios had the most influence on the shape of the ttds in the downstream sites mean dn of 0 24 and 0 61 for upstream and downstream respectively table s8 and fig 6 doubled recharge 2r scenario was the scenario that most consistently caused significant deviation from the baseline scenario mean dn 0 67 in five out of six stream sites figs 5 and 6 this might be explained by the significant impact of variation in groundwater recharge on hydraulic gradients which in turn affected the length of the streamlines and corresponding transit times in the unconfined aquifer system 3 3 upstream particle tracking sites 6 km 13 km and 21 km groundwater discharge to streams was dominated by local shallow flow paths with short transit times in the upstream sites of 6 km 13 km and 21 km in each recharge and aquifer riverbed scenario the maximum mtt was around 7 years fig s9 and tables s3 s7 observing shorter travel times at upstream particle tracking sites may be due to the partial penetration of the stream network in the headwaters of the watershed where intermediate and deeper flow paths did not converge into the stream cells these cells act like weak sinks permitting the underflow of groundwater beneath the river cells in the numerical model abrams et al 2012 as explained below ttds for upstream sites are significantly different under riverbed hydraulic conductivity doubled recharge horizontal hydraulic conductivity and porosity scenarios fig 6 and fig s6 especially under the lowest uniform riverbed hydraulic conductivity scenario 0 05 m d the ttd curves shifted towards older ages for lower riverbed hydraulic conductivity the connection between the aquifer and the stream is weakened lackey et al 2015 this weakened connection results in variations in local hydraulic gradients which in turn might affect the shorter flow paths discharging younger water at these sites goderniaux et al 2013 for constant aquifer thickness an increase in recharge close to the outlet tends to generate much younger groundwater where the velocity is higher for the shorter flow paths close to the discharge point etcheverry 2001 leray et al 2016 leray et al 2019 however the doubled recharge 2r scenario resulted in a shift towards larger transit times which is counterintuitive but can be explained by the large number of flooded cells where simulated head is above the top of the cell that altered the local flow paths and generated longer flow paths at the upstream of these stream sites fig s10 this artificial condition occurs due to the unrealistic amount of recharge values especially in the upstream part of the model domain which acts as intermediate and regional recharge areas generating longer flow paths with larger transit times with the vertically increasing horizontal hydraulic conductivity scenario where lower conductivities are in the upper model layers the ttd curve was shifted to slightly older ages this result is consistent with etcheverry and perrochet 2000 which found that when low hydraulic conductivity is in the upper model layers the ttd shifts to older transit times because low hydraulic conductivity acts as a retardation factor similar decreases in transit times were reported in previous studies where hydraulic conductivities increased horizontally and or vertically etcheverry and perrochet 2000 leray et al 2019 edington and poeter 2006 haitjema 1995 the porosity scenarios also have a strong effect on the transit times where an increasing vertical trend lower porosity in the upper layers resulted in a shift towards younger ages in the upstream particle tracking sites effects of porosity can be explained by the higher flow velocities in the upper layers resulting in a shift to shorter transit times since the porosity is inversely proportional to the average linear groundwater velocity 3 4 intermediate particle tracking site 40 km the mtts range from 10 years to 397 years in the 40 km site which is located just upstream of the confluence of the upper middle and northern branches of the umlr the ttds were generally bimodal with very short 1 year and long transit times e g uni n i and 0 5r scenarios in fig 5 see also fig s9 and tables s3 s7 intermediate flow paths resulted in a spread in the ttds and larger coefficient of variations in the mtts were observed at this particle tracking site figures 6 and s9 and tables s3 and s7 unlike the upstream sites the 40 km site yielded particles with older transit times which follow longer streamlines the increasing horizontal hydraulic conductivity scenario resulted in a shift towards older ages as well as the highest ks test score at this site for geological settings where the hydraulic conductivity of the aquifer material increases with depth zlotnik et al 2011 concluded that local and intermediate depths flow systems disappear and or are weakened and deeper groundwater circulation occurs where the water recharging the aquifer is pulled downward to the bottom portions of the flow domain riverbed hydraulic conductivity scenarios still had a large effect on the shape of the ttds and the mtts where a lower conductivity 0 05 md 1 resulted in a shift towards older ages due to the reduced connection between the stream and aquifer however in contrast to the upstream study sites the effect of doubled and halved recharge was greater at 40 km the increasing porosity scenario lower porosity in the upper layers resulted in a shift towards shorter transit time and the shape of the ttd curve remained similar to the baseline scenario fig 5 overall variations in the shape of the ttds at this site might be related to spatial proximity to the middle branch of the umlr and the local stream density which in turn affects the flow regime and the length of the particle streamlines discharging at this site 3 5 downstream particle tracking sites 99 km and 158 km in the downstream particle tracking sites 99 km and 158 km sites recharge and aquifer scenarios significantly changed the shape of the ttd curves which were generally dominated by the particles traveling with intermediate and deep flow paths originating near the western northern and southern boundaries of the flow model the simulated mtts ranged from 820 to 2192 years and 2133 to 7968 years at 99 km and 158 km respectively tables s3 and s9 the ttd curves generally had leptokurtic characteristics with long tails which is due to the fewer particles with longer streamlines and longer transit times fig 5 the largest positive skewness 1 was also observed in this particle tracking site doubled and halved recharge scenarios resulted in the most significant change in the ttds and the mtts at these sites fig 6 and fig s8 increased recharge e g 2r scenario scenario caused a shift towards shorter transit times while reducing the range of the transit times this behavior in the ttd characteristics is parallel to the findings of previous modeling studies that assumed uniform aquifer thickness and recharge conditions haitjema 1995 etcheverry 2001 leray et al 2016 leray et al 2019 the overall behavior of increasing mtt with decreased recharge rate fig 7 was also consistent with lumped parameter models e g exponential model vogel 1967 solomon et al 2006 halved recharge 0 5r on the other hand resulted in a shift towards older ages due to weakening of local flow paths close to the particle tracking sites as well as the slower input to a certain volume caused a longer residence time engdahl and maxwell 2015 also obtained a similar ttd shift to older ages when they decreased the recharge by 50 in their numerical groundwater model additionally under low recharge conditions the ttd curve shifts to longer transit times with decreasing level of stream and aquifer interaction due to the weakening of local flow paths goderniaux et al 2013 the downstream transects were also affected less by the flooded and dried model cells in the upstream part of the model domain under 0 5r and 2r recharge scenarios unlike at the upstream sites riverbed conductivity scenarios had less impact on the ttds at 99 km and 158 km fig 8 the ttds were more sensitive to a variation in aquifer hydraulic conductivity than the riverbed conductivity in these downstream particle tracking sites figs 5 and 6 similarly kalbus et al 2009 reported that the aquifer heterogeneity plays a more important role than the riverbed heterogeneity in groundwater discharge to streams overall shapes of the ttd curves fig 6 are closer to an exponential distribution moving from 99 km to 158 km i e as spatial scale increased where the discharge point is closer to the outlet of the ground watershed under a uniform recharge as discussed in haitjema 1995 4 implications and future work in this study the steady state 3d groundwater flow model utilized an actual catchment geometry together with hypothetical recharge aquifer and riverbed parameter scenarios the particle tracking was based on the advective transport of groundwater parcels in the flow domain simulations indicate significant change in the transit times in most of the simulation scenarios this age shift from the baseline scenario was also more prominent in the ttds than in the mtts e g fig 6 and fig s8 the results of the particle tracking simulations also showed that the transit times were not only controlled by different model parameters such as recharge or aquifer s hydraulic parameters but also the local and regional scale groundwater conditions at different particle tracking sites for example the upstream discharge sites were dominated by local and shallow flow system in which the effects of disconnection between aquifer and stream e g a very low riverbed conductivity scenario was more significant due to the disappearing of local hydraulic gradients at these stream sites however in the downstream sites groundwater discharge is mainly dominated by intermediate and deeper flow systems and affected less by the riverbed conductivity since the regional groundwater flow direction and the longer streamlines were not significantly affected the ks test scores fig 6 and fig s8 also suggest that the ttds at the study sites were less sensitive to spatially varying recharge scenarios e g modis estimated or lateral recharge gradient scenario than a uniform change in the magnitude of recharge e g halved or doubled recharge outliers in transit times were generally observed at sites 40 km and 158 km fig s9 it can be explained by very short and very long streamlines modeled based on the groundwater velocity distributions and the particle tracking algorithm that allows a particle to terminate within a boundary cell in the model domain this makes a small number of particles terminate faster or slower than most of the particles for example at 158 km some of the particles are traveling with very long regional flow paths without being terminated at a boundary cell thus reaching at the very eastern part of the model domain fig 4 for any hydrological model uncertainty exists in each input yet there are finite resources available for data collection though the sensitivity of model parameters in other study sites may not have the same results as ours the results of this study can help guide future modeling ttd studies in the identification of the most influential model parameters this information can help them prioritize their data collection efforts overall the results indicate that the sensitivity of the model parameterization on the ttds should also be investigated by considering the spatial characteristics of the regional aquifer system this emphasizes the importance of using local calibration targets such as groundwater tracer ages in the numerical model calibration process considering the actual geological heterogeneity of the aquifer system by using a 3d model will also improve the accuracy of the particle streamlines and related ttd predictions the ttds also were affected by the accuracy of the particle tracking of the coarse numerical model grids 125 m that do not represent the actual stream area or geometry in the watersheds abrams 2013 this regional scale grid discretization also limited the understanding of the link between the topography and dynamics of groundwater flow movement ttds due to the hummocky topography in the nsh the local grid refinement and or small scale numerical model development especially in the target sites e g particle tracking groundwater sampling sites may eventually increase the accuracy of the predictions of the future numerical models this study was an important step toward understanding the potential hydrological mechanisms driving discrepancies between the ttds obtained from numerical model and groundwater age dating tracer studies in the umlr watershed in future research comparison of calibrated model ttds and age dating tracer ttds can refine the understanding of the hydrological processes and discrepancies between the different estimation methods collectively these studies will provide guidance for future particle tracking simulations both for incorporating environmental tracer information into groundwater model calibration and for using particle tracking as a preliminary guide when designing field tracer studies 5 conclusions the ttds of groundwater discharges at six different river sites in the umlr watershed were modeled using coupled numerical groundwater flow modeling modflow usg and particle tracking modpath 3du under varying recharge aquifer and riverbed heterogeneity scenarios obtained mtts and ttds were compared with a baseline scenario using the real aquifer geometry and represented with five vertical layers with uniform recharge aquifer and stream parameters simulation results showed how the mtts and ttds spatially vary in response to these parameter scenarios with a clear upstream to downstream increasing trend in the umlr watershed maximum mtts range between 7 years and 7968 years upstream particle tracking sites were characterized with local and shallow flow paths with short transit times while downstream sites were dominated by intermediate and deeper flow paths with significantly longer transit times furthermore the effect of each scenario on ttds and mtts also varied at each particle tracking site in the upstream particles tracking sites transit times were generally more sensitive to a change in riverbed hydraulic conductivity while increasing and decreasing uniform recharge had more control on the shape of the ttds in the downstream sites in the flow domain results showed that the different model parameters were important for controlling the ttds for different parts of the watershed where the particle travel paths vary depending on the conditions of local and

2519,determining a suitable protection zone around the pumping well is necessary to protect the quantity and quality of water multiple researchers have facilitated the determination of protective zones around the pumping wells by introducing specific definitions concepts such as influence zone capture zone transport zone and wellhead protection zone and developing analytical and numerical methods however determining the quantitative and qualitative protection zones is still challenging the influence zone is a region where the water level decreases due to well discharge since most concepts of protective zones depend on the influence zone the current study focused on investigation of the drawdown cone and influence radius as two characteristics of the influence zone investigations were performed using the numerical modflow model and the results were compared with some analytical models including moench neuman theis etc the entire drawdown cone was considered to determine the protection zones of the pumping well the influence radius solely represented one of the drawdown cone curves and when calculated by the uncertain assumptions methods significant amounts of volume and flow in the drawdown cone are ignored the influence radius could not be considered as a definitive parameter as this radial distance strongly depends on the definition keywords influence radius drawdown cone well protection zone analytical model numerical model data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction there are many types of aquifers that in them the relations governing the hydraulics of the well are different the knowledge of groundwater and its usage by wells and qanats goes back to thousands of years however what is currently available in the form of mathematical equations relies on the pioneer study of darcy 1856 determination of the protection zone of a pumping well generally depends on the shape of the water table prior pumping and the shape of the drawdown cone after pumping darcy formulated the relationship between the gradient of the water table and hydraulic conductivity dupuit 1863 assumed the existence of a pumping well in the center of a circular island and derived an equation to compute the water level around the well thiem 1906 later replaced the assumption of a circular island with an infinite aquifer and applied the dupuit equation to calculate the drawdown cone in infinite aquifers houben and batelaan 2022 theis 1935 formulated transient radial flow to pumping wells and presented a solution that led to a significant progress in well hydraulics despite theis s solution was originally derived for confined aquifers this approach is also applicable for unconfined aquifers provided that the drawdown in the aquifer is small neuman 1972 1974 and moench 1997 also offered two solutions for drawdown around pumping wells in unconfined aquifers which included more details about the pumping well observation well and aquifer characteristics these three equations incorporate the time variable with capability to calculate the influence radius in transient conditions the analytical solutions such as neuman moench and theis are derived based on the analytical mathematics and comprise a number of components that must be approximated by iterative methods although the limitations for matching the natural conditions of the aquifer and well are relatively higher in theis solution this method is often preferred due to its simplicity furthermore several algebraic solutions have been introduced to solve this equation with high accuracy theis equation applies an exponential integral where its values are obtained from pre prepared tables or approximating formulas published by cooper and jacob 1946 with less accuracy as well as barry et al 2000 and watankhah 2014 with high accuracy during the evolution of well hydraulic science various researchers tried to simulate the flow around the pumping well and estimate the influence radius a number of empirical or analytical equations have been proposed with steady or unsteady flow assumptions some of those equations have been mentioned by lemke in 1886 bear 1979 schultze 1924 siechart and kyrieleis in 1930 louwyck et al 2022 de glee 1930 muskat 1934 weber bear 1979 hurst bresciani et al 2020 vanpoolen bresciani et al 2020 lee bresciani et al 2020 wilbur zhai et al 2021 and kusakin zhai et al 2021 all these equations include simplifications for pertinence with limited data and convert the complex hydrogeological situations to more straightforward hydrogeological ones however with the aid of high speed processing computers the methods that consider more details about the pumping well and aquifer have received increasing attention the approaches based on the steady flow assumption as well as those proposed by cooper and jacob for unsteady conditions are inaccurate for calculation of the influence radius bresciani et al 2020 dragoni 1998 zhai et al 2021 the influence radius is defined as a radial distance around the well where the pumping influence is significant bresciani et al 2020 however the term significant is inaccurate and may be interpreted differently in varied applications bresciani et al 2020 showed that this term could be calculated based on absolute drawdown relative drawdown relative flow or relative volume zhai et al 2021 believed that the influence radius calculated by the steady state solutions and the assumption of cooper and jacob is far from reality and even in their opinion influence radius presents no scientific or practical importance and could be neglected in the discussion on water resources protection louwyck et al 2022 accepted the invalidity of some old equations but they still believe that if theoretically justified these equations can be useful for calculating the influence radius and groundwater management motyka and d obyrn 2022 discussed different methods for determining the influence radius and highlighted their advantages and drawbacks as well as some practical problems in estimation of this concept the numerical models such as modflow are known as promising tools for calculation of the three dimensional drawdown cone which represent the actual conditions of the aquifer and pumping wells with relatively higher accuracy compared to the analytical approaches the drawdown cone and the influence zone computed using the numerical models are more accurate and provide a reliable protection zone of the pumping wells on the other hand the high preparation cost of the three dimensional models of the aquifer is a challenge for determining the protection zone of a pumping well the cost limitation of the numerical models makes the analytical and semi analytical models as viable options for calculating the influence zone and capture zone examining the results of numerical models in different conditions makes it possible to find suitable solutions for correcting the results of analytical models therefore in this research the effect of various factors on the drawdown cone and influence radius was investigated using modflow numerical model and analytical models and its results can be used to correct the calculations of analytical models 2 materials and methods 2 1 the modflow capabilities used in this study modflow solves differential equations of groundwater flow in porous media based on the finite difference method indeed some new versions of this model are based on finite volume calculations langevin et al 2017 mcdonald and harbaugh 1984 1988 in modflow various packages have been provided to apply the external and internal boundary conditions these packages aid to apply the recharge and discharge sources in the aquifer with relatively significant accuracy the possibility of applying horizontal and vertical anisotropy and simulation of flow in multi layered aquifers is also available one of the valuable packages in this model is the multi node well package that provides screening at different depths also in this model the grids could be refined in different ways to increase accuracy in some points of the aquifer such as water wells therefore this model can be used to evaluate different parameters affecting the well drawdown cone 2 2 aquifer specifications and model design the accuracy of wells simulation in modflow is at the level of analytical models barrash and dougherty 1997 in this study a rectangular grid was used in modflow to simulate the well and investigate the effect of influencing factors on the drawdown cone and influence radius and finally the capture zone and the discharge zone the aquifer under investigation was an unconfined alluvial type with a saturated thickness of 100 m specific yield of 0 1 specific storage of 0 000001 hydraulic conductivity of 10 m d and almost an infinite size of 60 km 60 km a well located in the center of the aquifer was pumped with a discharge rate of 4000 m3 d for 360 days the effects of the well and aquifer parameters was evaluated over 180 days the aquifer designed in this research was considered such wide that it could be assumed to be infinite thus its outer boundaries were chosen without flow the values of the above mentioned parameters were initially used to compare the results of analytical and numerical models during the investigations the value of each affecting parameter was altered in several steps within an acceptable range the above initial values were selected such that during the evaluation of the effect of each parameter their values could be increased or decreased up to ten times furthermore in these changes the well drawdown cone was kept distant from the aquifer boundaries the reason for choosing an unconfined alluvial aquifer with the above specifications in this study is due to their abundance in the nature the extent of exploitation in unconfined alluvial aquifers is often more than other aquifers furthermore the above values are almost equal to the mean values of the hydrodynamic coefficients of unconfined alluvial aquifers unfortunately the distance between the wells is not properly controlled in these aquifers and excessive exploitation of these aquifers arises from an insufficient understanding of the concepts related to the determination of the protection zone of the well the accuracy of the modflow model depends on the boundary condition grid discretization and the length of time step as stated previously the aquifer is considered such wide that the water drawdown in the well is not affected by the external boundaries on the other hand with repeated changes in two other parameters and comparing the results with analytical methods the appropriate values of these parameters were selected as follows gridding a well cell a cell of the aquifer in modflow where the well is placed was developed with dimensions of 0 25 m 0 25 m to 50 m 50 m with an expansion coefficient α of 1 2 in an area of 60 km 60 km the aquifer was designed in one layer with a thickness of 110 m and a saturation thickness of 100 m in some cases five layers of 20 m fig 1 stress periods in order to compare the results of the modflow model with those of analytical models and receive the results at the end of each stress period 360 day in 84 stress periods were selected according to table 1 3 theory and calculation for comparative evaluation of the modflow results it is first necessary to calculate the amount of water level drawdown at any time and distance from the well for all methods in this section the equations and a summary of the methods of solving the analytical methods of theis neuman and moench are presented the equations of other experimental and analytical methods have been presented in appendix a the moench solution method is an analytical solution presented for unconfined aquifers and its equation is as follows 1 h d r d z d 1 z d 2 p 1 z d 2 z d 1 z d 1 z d 2 h d r d z d p d z d the parameters of eq 1 are stated in muench s work including the bessel function of the second order zero types moench 1997 unfortunately this equation is set based on the dimensionless hydraulic head in laplace space furthermore this equation has no algebraic solution and its use requires computer programs after solving the water level drawdown for the average depth of an open surface of the piezometer at any time and distance from the well is determined neuman s solution method is an analytical solution method for unconfined aquifers and its equation is as follows 2 s r z t q 4 π t 0 4 y j 0 y β 1 2 u 0 y n 1 u n y d y the parameters of eq 2 are given in neuman s articles and include the zero order bessel function neuman 1972 1974 similar to muench solution this equation also does not have an algebraic solution and its use requires computer programs nevertheless this equation finally provides the water level drawdown for the open depth of the piezometer at any time and distance from the well theis solution method is an analytical solution method for a confined aquifer which is also valid in unconfined aquifers with a low water level drawdown and its equation is as follows 3 s r t q 4 π t u e x x d x s r t q 4 π t w u u r 2 s 4 t t the parameters of eq 3 are stated in theis s study and include an exponential integral function theis 1935 although calculation of the value of the exponential integral function requires a computer program algebraic methods are also provided for its estimation with reasonable accuracy this equation finally provides the average water level drawdown at any time and distance from the well in the current research computer code was used for all three mentioned equations also in the theis equation the approximation method of barry et al was employed eq 4 rewritten by vatankhah barry et al 2000 vatankhah 2014 this approximation can easily be used in programs like excel and for each u value the value of the exponential integral function or the w function is estimated 4 w exp u 0 5616 0 4385 e x p 2 2803 u l n 1 0 5615 u 0 4385 a 2 where a is 1 0421 u 1 u 1 5 1 1 0801 1 2 35 u 1 0919 1 comparing the results of the modflow model with the analytical equations showed that in less than one day the amounts of computational drawdown in the four methods did not match but from one day onwards the amount of computational drawdown is very close to all four methods fig 2 as a result the theis method could be the preferred approach for long pumping durations due to its more straightforward and understandable solution to calculate the drawdown cone and evaluate the zone of influence comparison of the drawdown distance s r results also shows that the drawdown cones calculated by the model and analytical methods are almost similar fig 3 shows the dimensionless values of drawdown and distance for 30 60 and 90 days the dimensionless drawdown s d calculated from eq 5 is equivalent to the value of exponential integral function or the well function w in theis equation the second power of the dimensionless distance r d 2 which is equivalent to u in the theis equation is also calculated from eq 6 5 s d 4 π t s q w 6 r d 2 s r 2 4 t t u as can be seen in fig 3 the results of the model and the methods of theis and neuman are close to each other for long distances and with minimal drawdown at sufficiently far distances the s values in the neuman and modflow methods were respectively estimated up to 10 5 and 10 6 due to cutting of the final values in the iteration processes in contrast this value in the theis solution could be calculated in even smaller quantities due to the algebraic approximation in this approach the results of modflow are equal with the analytical equations for drawdowns of less than 1 mm this level of accuracy is considered sufficient to determine the drawdown cone and influence zone 4 results 4 1 the effects of influential factors on the drawdown cone and influence radius 4 1 1 investigating the effect of transmissivity hydraulic conductivity and saturation thickness the transmissivity t is the product of the aquifer s hydraulic conductivity coefficient and saturation thickness therefore the effects of changes in these three parameters on the drawdown cone and influence radius are similar in the theis equation eq 3 t is appeared in two ways in u value as well as a coefficient for w as w itself is a function of u both w and the coefficient of w are affected by alteration of the t value in other words the effect of t on drawdown is different at varied distances from the well for instance increase of t in close distances causes a decrease in drawdown whereas in far distances it causes an increase in drawdown in other words with increase of t the drawdown cone becomes broader and shallower fig 4 shows the effect of t changes on the drawdown cone and the influence radius the significant part of the drawdown cone where the drawdown value is more than 10 cm is located at a radius of 2000 m at this distance the amount of drawdown and its related influence radius are decreased with increase of t from this distance onwards these two values are increased with the increase of t the remarkable point is that at a certain distance from the well about 2000 m in this case the calculated drawdown would be almost the same about 10 cm in this case for different values of t therefore selection of the absolute drawdown as the criterion for determining the influence radius leads to misleading results in particular when the value of absolute drawdown is not determined via a valid standard the obtained radius might be significantly far from the actual radius in this study the value of the influence radius varies from about 5000 to 13000 m for almost zero drawdowns while for a drawdown of approximately 10 cm the influence radius for different values of t is about 2000 m which shows that the drawdown cone is more important than the influence radius 4 1 2 investigating the effect of storativity specific storage and specific yield the storativity s in the unconfined aquifer is the sum of the specific yield and the storage coefficient the storage coefficient itself is the product of the specific storage in the saturation thickness in the theis method s appears in eq 3 in the u parameter with increase of s the u value increases and the value of w decreases and finally the amounts of drawdown and influence radius are decreased as shown in fig 5 with the increase of s the influence zone becomes smaller and this decrease in the volume of the drawdown cone occurs in both the surface and depth directions however the radial decrease rate is much higher than the depth decrease rate as seen with a 10 fold rise in the storage capacity the influence radius reaches from about 19 500 m to about 6 500 m the remarkable point is that with rise of the storativity the drawdown cone in a semi logarithmic scale changes its position uniformly towards the well not only upwards and its volume decreases 4 1 3 investigating the effect of pumping flow rate and pumping frequency the amount of discharge q in the theis method appears in eq 3 in the form of coefficient for w with increase of q the amounts of drawdown and the influence radius are raised the drawdown increase ratio is proportional to the discharge increase ratio thus when the discharge doubles in all points of the drawdown cone the drawdown value is also doubled since the drawdown around the well is high its amount around the well increases sharply with the increase in discharge but the amount of drawdown at distances far from the well increases with less intensity fig 6 shows the effects of increasing discharge on the drawdown cone and influence radius it is known that the increased discharges result in the surface and depth expansion of the drawdown cone but the depth expansion is much more significant than the surface expansion in this case with a 6 fold increase in discharge from 1000 to 6000 m3 d the value of the influence radius is increased from about 6000 m to only about 7000 m while for a distance of 10 m the amount of drawdown from about 1 m is increased to about 6 m pumping is one of the influential factors on the cone of drawdown perhaps the general idea is that when the well is shut down for few hours the major part of the drawdown will be recovered with this idea the time required to determine the influence zone may be wrongly considered equal to the hours of continuous activity the aquifer in this study was simulated for 180 days with a discharge rate of 4000 m3 d both continuously and at on off times to investigate the effects of successive and un successive pumping during the successive shutdowns the water volume coming out of the aquifer is reduced to half in 180 days thus the well was simulated with a continuous discharge of 2000 m3 d as can be seen in fig 7 the continuous activity of the well at all hours with discharges of 2000 and 4000 each creates a drawdown cone where the latter is broader and deeper than the former as shown in fig 7b the effect of non continuous pumping is observed only at a short distance from the well less than 100 m beyond this distance the overall shape of the drawdown cone corresponds to the total pumping time 180 d showing that the drawdown recovery time for long distances is much longer than the pumping time thus it does not recover in consecutive shutdowns as a result the total duration of pumping should be the criterion of action sum of on and off periods in determining the protection zone the required flow rate to assess the influence zone should be selected according to the ratio of the pump activity time to the total time the drawdown cone with a continuous flow rate of 2000 and discontinuous flow rate of 4000 have little differences at the beginning and end which is expectable as the flow rate of 2000 creates a smaller drawdown around the well therefore the width of the drawdown cone at the end becomes a little wider 4 1 4 investigating the effect of primary hydraulic gradient or uniform flow due to the water flow toward the well the water table around the well is reduced and a theoretical drawdown cone imaginary and invisible could be calculated for that the water table is also decreased by the natural flow in the aquifer the combination of these two drawdowns creates an almost conical water surface around the well which is the real drawdown cone objective and visible in an infinite aquifer with a horizontal water level the theoretical and actual drawdown cones coincide and when the aquifer is homogeneous and isotropic the drawdown cone is symmetrical in a sloping aquifer the theoretical and real drawdown cones do not coincide in the profile the real drawdown cone is proportional to the initial slope and asymmetric in the core but its symmetry is gradually increased finally the real drawdown cone coincides with the theoretical one in the maximum area and appears almost circular in the plan the effect of slope on the theoretical drawdown cone is shown in fig 8 the influence zone is almost symmetrical in the up and down directions and coincides with a significant part of the theoretical drawdown cone at different slopes up to a drawdown of approximately 1 mm and a radius of about 5000 m for the typical slopes the theoretical drawdown cones extracted from modflow are not much different from the drawdown cone with no hydraulic gradient thus the theoretical drawdown cone can be easily calculated with simple analytical methods such as the theis equation what is mentioned in the sources about the drawdown cone is about the real drawdown cone to extract with analytical calculations the theoretical drawdown cone should first be extracted with a method like theis then by subtracting the theoretical drawdown from the initial sloping water level the level of the real drawdown cone should be calculated in fig 9 the real drawdown cone is calculated for the initial slope of 0 010 for the desired well and aquifer as can be seen the influence zone and the real drawdown cone are asymmetric and very wide however the stagnation point has appeared at a close distance from the well about 100 m and this point is the end of the capture zone of the well 4 1 5 investigating the effect of pumping time and time after pumping time t in the theis method eq 3 appears in the u parameter with the increase of t the u value is decreased while w is raised which in turn results in increase of the amount of drawdown and its related value of the influence radius finally with at increased t the drawdown cone expands in both the surface and vertical directions fig 10 shows the effect of t on the surface and depth expansion of the drawdown cone the growth of the drawdown cone is faster in short times while in long times the development of the drawdown cone is slower a remarkable point is that by increasing a certain amount in t the drawdown cone expands at the surface and in depth moving uniformly away from the well on a semi logarithmic scale not only downwards for long periods increase of t again causes a minimal drawdown in the aquifer as it is evident in monitoring of the well water depth the slight increase in the drawdown raises the assumption of steady flow for long pumping intervals however this is due to our limitation in measuring and showing the drawdown changes in long pumping times with continued pumping after long intervals a minimal amount of drawdown in the well which is unmeasurable and ignored significantly expands the drawdown cone over long distances and stimulates the water flow towards the well after the pump shuts down the drawdown cone and influence radius continue to expand recovery of losses in a pumping well begins immediately after the pump is turned off a significant part of the losses is initially recovered while the recovery of the total losses continues for several times longer than the pumping at distances far from the well loss recovery does not begin immediately after the pump is turned off since the effect of the pump shutdown has not yet reached to this region at the points located near the maximum influence radius the pumping effect is received when the pump is turned off and then water table starts to decrease the reduction of the water level at this point continues for a long period several times longer than the duration of pumping after that a long time is again needed for recovery of the drawdown and reaching equilibrium it is noteworthy that the total drawdown is never recovered when the aquifer is not recharged fig 11 shows the drawdown recovery of the well and the observation well of our target aquifer at the maximum influence radius during pumping distance of 6748 m from the well when the pump is turned off the drawdown cone near the well becomes smaller and gradually wider at the end fig 12 examination of the shape change process of the drawdown cone indicates the possibility of extracting an inflection point on the drawdown cone when the pump is turned off the water level gradually rises for the distances before the inflection point and slowly falls for the distances after this point in other words the inflection point is the distance from the well that has the lowest drawdown during pumping and its drawdown is not increased after turning the pump off at distances beyond this point the drawdown value is increased when the pump is turned off therefore its radius distance from the well could be a proper reference for introducing the influence radius as seen in fig 12 the drawdown at the inflection point is about 30 cm and the influence radius related to it is approximately 1400 m therefore the maximum radius around this well that experiences 30 cm of drawdown is about 1400 m the influence radius of drawdowns less than this value is not unique and continues to increase after the pump is turned off 4 1 6 investigating the effect of recharge from the aquifer surface in the case of uniform recharge in an area much greater than the influence zone of the well the drawdown cone and the water level resulting from the analytical relationship can be modified for the recharge conditions any uniform increase in the recharge of the aquifer over the expected period will raise a certain amount to the water level of the whole aquifer therefore at the end of the expected time the aquifer possesses a secondary water level which is higher than the primary level the magnitude of increase in the water level of the aquifer in uniform recharge is resulted from dividing the amount of recharge to the specific yield when the drawdown cones are measured relative to the secondary water level it is observed that all the drawdown cones coincide for each recharge amount this means that the overall shape of the drawdown cone is not altered during recharge instead the drawdown cone only changes its position vertically and climbs upwards fig 13 shows the position of the drawdown cone and the effect of the well in the condition of no recharge and with a recharge equal to 100 mm in 180 days relative to the primary water level 100 m level and relative to the secondary water level 101 m level the secondary level is 1 m higher than the primary level because during 180 days of pumping 100 mm of water is entered from the surface according to the specific yield of 10 as can be seen the drawdown cone in the 100 mm recharge mode possesses a same shape however when the initial water level was considered as the base for measurements the water table was changed from 100 m to 95 m from this point of view the maximum water drawdown in the well was 5 m and the maximum influence radius was about 427 m in contrast when the calculations were carried out according to the secondary water level the water table was reduced from 101 m to 95 m in this case the maximum water drawdown in the well and the maximum influence radius were respectively 6 m and about 6748 m the slope of the h r relationship indicated that the drawdown cone moves uniformly to the upper side not towards the well at increased recharges therefore it is easy to modify the drawdown cone resulting from the analytical relationships for recharge conditions 4 1 7 investigating the effect of horizontal and vertical anisotropy anisotropy relates to the hydraulic conductivity changes in the x y and z directions for example when the hydraulic conductivity is high in the x direction and decreases in the y direction the drawdown cone slightly expands in the x direction and compresses significantly in the y direction this issue can be justified by considering the volume fig 14 a anisotropy in the vertical direction is more common in the aquifer however our study showed that in the saturated thickness range of 100 m and full penetration of the well its effects on the drawdown cone are insignificant fig 14b as a solution in case of anisotropy in the x and y directions the theis equation can be employed to calculate the drawdown in each direction using its corresponding hydraulic conductivity moreover in any direction the real drawdown could be drawn using the drawdown head in that direction 4 1 8 investigating the effect of partial penetration of the well in the aquifer the partial penetration increases the flow length around the well naturally it increases the water loss in the well and at high vertical anisotropies the effect of partial penetration on the water loss in the well and its surroundings is more significant in modflow it is possible to apply partial penetration with the multi node well mnw package in multilayer gridding by creating a 5 layer grid and screening at different levels the effect of partial penetration on the drawdown cone was calculated as shown in fig 15 the partial penetration has significant effects only up to a short distance from the well after that the drawdown cone resulting from different percentages of partial penetration coincides with that resulted from complete penetration therefore in the analytical calculations one can either use methods such as moench and neuman which apply the effect of partial penetration or ignore the effects of low partial penetration 4 1 9 investigating the effect of heterogeneity according to the knowledge of sedimentology in watersheds heterogeneity mostly has a specific direction and it is not a random phenomenon heterogeneity is mainly formed in the direction of sedimentation flow in alluvium both transmissivity and storativity are increased towards the upstream side of a basin on the contrary both these parameters decrease towards the downstream side of the basin it seems that these opposite effects prevent the expansion or excessive compression of the drawdown cone also there would be no significant change in the width of the drawdown cone in the left and right directions finally due to heterogeneity in the theoretical drawdown cone there will be successive changes in the water level it seems that these changes are less in the upstream direction and more in the downstream direction although there is no much change in its extent this issue has significant complications and requires an independent research 4 2 evaluating the drawdown cone based on different criteria as previously stated by using the theis neuman and moench methods for the desired aquifer and the corresponding well the amount of drawdown at each distance from the well s r is specified thiem s equation eq 7 for the unconfined aquifer is similar to the dupuit s equation 7 h r 2 h w 2 q π k l n r r w where hw and hr are respectively the water levels of the well and the aquifer for the effective radius of the well rw 0 249 m in the theis equation the drawdown value s in our desired aquifer was equal to 5 7264 m by considering an aquifer thickness of 100 m hw was 94 2735 m moreover for q of 4000 m3 d and k of 10 m d the water level drawdown for each distance from the well sr could be determined from eq 7 the cooper and jacob equation is presented for short distances and long times this solution which approximates the theis equation is presented as follows 8 s r q 4 π t l n 2 25 t t r 2 s in the desired aquifer for k of 10 m d and saturation thickness of 100 m the t value was equal to kb 1000 m2 d by considering the s q and t values of 0 1001 4000 m3 d and 180 days the amount of drawdown for each distance from the well sr could be determined from eq 8 in the studied well investigation of the drawdown in the period of 170 to 180 days of pumping shows that in the intervals of 1 day the change of drawdown was about 2 mm which might not be detectable with the standard measurement tools this small change of drawdown in the well is not necessarily related to the flow stability unless the dupuit s round island conditions exist or the well is located near an inexhaustible water source for comparison the drawdown cones obtained from different methods are shown in fig 16 although all the drawdown cones match at the beginning the drawdown cone of the thiem method gradually separated from other drawdown cones and estimated a smaller influence radius in contrast to the theim method the drawdown cone of the cooper and jacob solution corresponds more to the other approaches however this method is also separated in low drawdown values and estimates a relatively smaller influence radius the drawdown cones of theis neuman moench and modflow methods are identical from the beginning to the end up to a minimal drawdown of 0 1 mm and thus their graphs are shown in one color the influence radius of the thiem method is about 1558 m which is equivalent to the drawdown of about 26 cm in the real drawdown cone this means that the drawdown cone is neglected in the distance of 1558 m onwards in this method although this region plays a crucial role in supplying the water of the well this concept is also valid for the cooper and jacob method where the drawdown cone is neglected for distances above 2011 m 4 3 evaluation of the influence radius based on different criteria as explained earlier the influence radius continues to grow after the pump is turned off and thus it must be paid attention in management of the aquifer exploitation in this part the value of the influence radius of the well is only considered for the pumping period the general relation of the influence radius is as follows bresciani et al 2020 9 r c tt s where the dimensionless coefficient c is a function of q and the criteria parameter a function of the desired minimum drawdown the above equation is not valid for the aquifers with initial flow in these aquifers some of the water released from the drawdown cone never flows toward the well and continues along the initial flow for the studied aquifer and well the influence radius was calculated based on different criteria and methods it was also shown to what extent the choice of method and type of criteria can be effective in estimating the influence radius 4 3 1 absolute drawdown criterion the equations related to some methods are given in appendix a based on the absolute drawdown the calculated values of the influence radius for several absolute drawdowns are given in table 2 in some methods the influence radius differs significantly from the actual values however the values of the influence radius obtained by the theis neuman moench and modflow approaches are closer to reality 4 3 2 relative drawdown criterion the relative drawdown αrd is obtained by dividing the absolute drawdown around the drawdown cone to the absolute drawdown in the center of the drawdown cone in the theis method the influence radius for each relative drawdown is obtained from eq 10 using bresciani s calculations bresciani et al 2020 10 α rd s r s w r c tt s c 2 u α w u at a distance of 0 25 m from the center of the well the water drawdown is 5 7264 m for these distance and drawdown values the well function w is extracted and multiplied by α to obtain a new w the u value is extracted for this new w and finally c and r are calculated based on this the influence radius in the studied well and the aquifer were calculated for several αrd values as shown in table 3 a significant part of the drawdown cone is located at a distance far from αrd of 1 after r 2548 m as can be seen the αrd concept provides a better understanding than the drawdown cone 4 3 3 relative flow rate criterion based on the relative flow criterion it is possible to estimate the influence radius for each value of the relative flow at the end of the drawdown cone the relative flow is obtained by dividing the flow around the drawdown cone to the flow in the center of the drawdown cone well discharge and can be represented by αrf for example in the theis method the influence radius for each relative drawdown value is obtained from eq 11 using bresciani et al calculations bresciani et al 2020 11 α rf q r q w r c tt s c 2 l n α based on eq 11 the influence radius in the studied well and the aquifer is calculated for several relative flows as given in table 4 and fig 17 a when the initial water level in the aquifer is almost horizontal the relative flow shows the water percentage supplied by the regions beyond each selected point on the drawdown cone as it can be seen 99 of the well discharge is provided in a radius of more than 268 m while 1 of the well discharge is provided in a radius of more than 5755 m in the absolute drawdown table 2 it was shown that the thiem method at a distance of 1558 m and the cooper and jacob method at a distance of 2011 m show zero drawdown these values are approximately equivalent to 70 and 55 in fig 17a which means that the accuracy of the drawdown cone in these methods is such low that 70 and 55 of the well flow is ignored 4 3 4 relative volume criterion based on the relative volume criterion the influence radius for each relative volume at the end of the drawdown cone could be estimated the relative volume αrv is obtained by dividing the volume of the part of the drawdown cone that is outside a radius to the total volume of the drawdown cone in theis method with bresciani et al calculations bresciani et al 2020 the influence radius for each relative volume is obtained from eq 12 12 α rv v r v 0 r c tt s c 2 u f α f e u u w u α in this equation f is a new function similar to w extraction of the u values from the f u function requires a computer program and its value is estimated through iterative solving for each value of f α however in programs like excel by determining the relationship between f u and w eq 12 as well as the relation of w and u eq 4 u can be estimated for each α by trial and error on this base the influence radius in the studied well and aquifer was calculated for several relative volumes as shown in table 5 and fig 17b when the initial water level in the aquifer is nearly horizontal the αrv value indicates the percentage of the drawdown cone volume outside each radial distance in our target aquifer 1 of the volume of the drawdown cone is located at a distance of 4685 m and 99 is located at a distance of 101 m in the absolute drawdown table 2 the thiem method at a distance of 1558 m and the cooper and jacob method at a distance of 2011 m showed zero drawdowns these values are approximately equivalent to 45 and 30 in fig 17b which means that the accuracy of the drawdown cone of these methods is such low that 45 and 30 of the cone volume is ignored 5 discussion it is necessary to know the location of some aquifer regions to determine the well protection zone in other words experts consider the location of these particular areas in the aquifer as an indicator for determining the well protected area most of the research on the protection of water resources is related to the pollution issue in every country responsible organizations participate in this matter by preparing guidelines e g united state environmental protection agency usepa 2008 united kingdom environment agency ukea 2019 united states geological survey langevin et al 2017 pollock 1988 pollock 2016 winston 2019 institute of geological and nuclear sciences limited moreau 2014 united state army corps of engineers zheng wang 1999 and iran s technical and executive system ites 2013 2014 numerous studies have also explained some of the concepts related to the protected area and presented analytical semi analytical and numerical methods for their estimation barlow et al 2018 bica et al 2019 fileccia 2015 grubb 1993 khalilabad et al 2022 since many terms have been used in the related sources with occasionally interfering meanings these particular locations have been introduced again in fig 18 followed by discussing the role and importance of the drawdown cone and the influence radius on each of these points although the boundary conditions may differ from the water level slope the condition shown in fig 18 is often valid in watersheds in such conditions the water level of the aquifer during the rainfall period gradually rises due to infiltration usually the effective porosity is higher toward upstream of the basin and a more considerable amount of water is stored in the aquifer subsequently due to the higher water level at the boundary of the water dividing line a natural flow is formed in the aquifer this natural flow is not uniform and its amount is higher at the end of the rainy season the amount of this natural flow gradually decreases until reaching a minimum at the end of the dry season or stop and the water level in the aquifer becomes almost horizontal therefore the closed equipotential lines of the well in such an aquifer can change their shape at different times and experience other states i e from a circular symmetrical state to an elongated ellipse when the shape of the equipotential lines is varied around the well the range of the flow lines leading to the well is changed which in turn alters the location of the areas that play role in determining the well protection zone among the areas related to the well protection zones the followings can be discussed and investigated 5 1 influence zone the specific parameters of this region have been studied and mentioned under different titles drawdown cone or cone of depression the influence radius or influence radius zone of influence or influence zone etc this part of the aquifer is a three dimensional zone around the well where changes occur in the water table and velocity of water movement for definition of the influence zone it is necessary to mention the pumping duration and the minimum amount of water level change although this zone is three dimensional it is mainly shown as equipotential lines in the plan e g a 180 day influence zone for the drawdown of 1 mm 1 cm 1 dm 1 m 2 m etc the flow net plays a decisive role in determining the areas related to the protection of the well and thus all curves of the drawdown are important however the last curve which its distance to the well is called the influence radius with a drawdown close to zero is not alone very important the pumping duration is another influential parameter which could be determined according to the maximum duration of the annual dry period to estimate the influence zone in the studied aquifer a period of 180 days was chosen according to the effect of different parameters the depth and expansion of the drawdown cone during 180 pumping days are shown in figs 4 15 as seen table 2 in the studied well the maximum radius of the influence zone was estimated to 6748 m with the modflow model fig 18 it is noteworthy that the radius of the influence zone is not a unique number which varies based on different criteria tables 2 5 5 2 capture zone the capture zone has been referred under different titles zone of capture contribution zone etc there are still ambiguities in the definition of these expressions the capture zone is a three dimensional zone around the well that supplies the water of the well and the flow is passed through it in this definition both the pumping period and the pumping time should be mentioned 180 day capture zone in the dry period 180 day capture zone in the wet period and capture zone in a steady state the capture zone for flow in aquifers with the horizontal water level in both steady and unsteady conditions corresponds with the drawdown cone the capture zone for a steady gradient flow is a fixed volume of the aquifer enclosed inside the flow lines leading to the stagnation point fig 18 when two water sources with a constant level are imagined on the left and right sides of the aquifer however the phrase capture zone is ambiguous for the aquifers with variable slopes in this case both the theoretical drawdown cone caused by the well and the sloping water table are transient these conditions are more common than the previous ones and exist in most aquifers in such aquifers the theoretical drawdown cone and the water table slope are constantly changing through time resulting in a continuous change of the real drawdown cone the flow net and the direction of water movement due to the continuous change of the real drawdown cone the position of the flow lines and the movement direction of the water particles are altered at any time the effect of the slope on the drawdown cone is shown in fig 8 and fig 9 it was observed that the slope of the water surface ultimately changes the shape of the real drawdown cone in the analytical models by calculating the real drawdown cone and drawing the flow net it is possible to observe the direction of water movement capture zone at any time in the numerical simulators after calculating the water level at any time by models such as modflow the particles could be tracked by routing models such as modpath since the flow net determines the path of water movement all the drawdown curves especially high drawdowns play a more significant role in determining the capture zone while the last curve which represents the influence radius is not very important in the studied well the maximum radius of the capture zone was estimated to 6748 m at the initial water level without slope on the other hand the distance of the stagnation point from the well xsp was 360 m in the uniform flow with a slope of 0 002 and the maximum width of the capture zone 2y was 800 m fig 18 5 3 discharge zone the discharge zone has been expressed under different titles such as transport zone zone of transport travel time zone capture zone with pumping duration wellhead protection area with pumping duration etc this part of the aquifer is a three dimensional zone around the well where all its water is discharged during the pumping period and replaced by water from distant areas in this definition both the pumping period and the pumping time should be considered 180 day discharge zone in the dry period 180 day discharge zone in the wet period and discharge zone in a steady state at the beginning of the drawdown cone formation all the released water is not discharged into the well the discharged water is originated from the entire saturated thickness of the aquifer close to the water well the water removed from the aquifer near the well is gradually replaced by the water from the distant parts the volume of a part of the aquifer that is emptied and replaced during pumping depends on the storage capacity of the aquifer effective porosity the discharge zone is a small part inside the capture zone when the water level of aquifer is almost horizontal its outer limit can be calculated through equating the volume of the water of discharged of the well with the volume of a part the aquifer which supplies this water the discharge zone in the simulation models is estimated based on the travel time zhou and haitjema 2012 the discharge zone is identified using the capture zone which in turn is a function of the whole drawdown cone therefore the influence radius has no role in determining the limits of the discharge zone in the studied well assuming the equality of effective porosity and specific yield the maximum radius of the discharge zone was estimated to be 151 m in the absence of uniform flow in a uniform flow with a slope of 0 002 the radius of the discharge zone towards the upstream and downstream sides was estimated to be 175 and 133 m respectively fig 18 5 4 recharge zone recharge zone has been noted under different titles including contributing area contributing recharge area etc this part of the aquifer is often defined as a two dimensional surface of the aquifer through which the aquifer is recharged barlow et al 2018 this zone is a land surface in the unconfined aquifer which recharges the aquifer during rainfall however it seems that limiting the definition of recharge zone to a two dimensional surface is an obstacle for expressing its effect on the quality of the aquifer this region is perhaps an unsaturated three dimensional part of the aquifer where the discharged water from the well is infiltrated from its surface into the aquifer the recharge zone plays an important role in the biological processes and purification of polluted water zhuang et al 2021 in unconfined aquifers where the water level is almost horizontal the plan of this zone corresponds to that of the capture zone and influence zone in an unconfined aquifer with a sloping water table the plan of recharge zone only corresponds to the plan view of the capture zone and is much different from that of the influence zone fig 18 in the confined aquifer the plan of the recharge zone corresponds only to a part of the capture zone 5 5 quantitative protection zone this region has been given less attention in research and sometimes considered equivalent to the influence radius ites 2014 the quantitative protection zone means an area around a well where water discharge from the aquifer is permitted only through that well this definition does not mean that drilling new wells is allowed anywhere outside this area with this definition each well has a quantitative protection zone and the distance between two wells equals their algebraic sum more research is needed to provide proper guidelines for determining the quantitative protection zone and in addition to the indicators of the influence zone it is also necessary to consider the water balance in the aquifer unfortunately in the recent years the excessive discharge of aquifers has created many environmental problems in this topic the water quantity of well and the quantitative protection zone must be observed from the hydraulic point of view when the discharge capacity of aquifer is high the maximum flow rate can be allowed for each well however some limitations must be observed in term of the property rights as a rule every land has an owner who needs water to benefit from his land if the primary wells in the basin are allowed to over discharge other landowners encounter water stress therefore through implementation of appropriate regulations the owners could be allowed to use the aquifer in proportion to their land in the basin or increase their discharge share by artificial injection during the rainy season the water rights of each owner must be determined such that the water balance and water rights of the environment are maintained in addition to the property rights determining the quantitative protection zone of each well requires at least four detailed studies 5 5 1 hydraulic studies and investigation of influence zone fig 6 and fig 7 show the effect of discharge on the drawdown cone with increase of discharge the depth of the drawdown cone increased more strongly near the well and its width increased slowly at further distances for example when the discharge is increased from 2000 to 4000 m3 d the well drawdown doubles and reaches from 3 m to 6 m whereas the maximum surface radius is increased from 6200 m to 6748 m in other words in the most critical situation when two wells are drilled near each other their drawdown cones are merged in comparison with the drawdown cone of one well the resulting drawdown is slightly wider at far distances and two folds more profound near the well in this case the discharge of the older well is slightly decreased compared to its initial value as the pump is designed for smaller drawdowns however the pump in the second well is designed for larger drawdowns and thus could supply the needed flow rate consequently no severe limitation in term of the hydraulic drawdown is observed in the quantitative protection zone therefore the influence radius could not be considered as an action criterion in the studied well the values of influence radius for drawdowns of 0 1 and 10 cm were respectively 6748 4100 and 2400 m when influence radius is considered as the reference for the quantitative protection zone the minimum distance between two wells is the sum of their influence radius r1 r2 calculation of the influence radius assists to understand a conceptual model of a well however determination of the quantitative protection zone and the distance between wells via the influence radius could not be justified hydraulically and the result of water balance calculation could be seen as a more appropriate basis for this aim 5 5 2 water balance studies the essential issue in determining the quantitative protection zone of the well is to maintain a water balance in the aquifer on this basis it is ideal that the amount of uniform flow is avoided in the calculations to be safe for the environment and the quantitative protection zone of the well is considered as a part of the influence zone that can supply the well annual discharge through recharge therefore from this point of view the area allocated to each well in aquifer is a circle with radius of r which can be estimated from the following equation 13 q t π r 2 r e r qt π r e from this point of view in our target aquifer the well information is as follows the annual recharge re of 100 mm q of 4000 m3 day and t of 180 days on this base the area of the quantitative protection zone is a circle with a radius of approximately 1514 m this means that a circular area with the radius of r must be allocated from the aquifer for water supply of this well in this way the minimum distance between two wells is the sum of the radii of their quantitative protection zone r1 r2 this issue has also been addressed by zhou 2011 5 5 3 subsidence and porosity studies if the water balance is considered for determining a well discharge the possibility of subsidence phenomenon and the gradual reduction of porosity and specific yield would be low nevertheless the large fluctuations of the water level in the aquifer increase the possibility of the subsidence phenomenon therefore it is necessary to determine the maximum allowable drawdown in the well and estimate the flow rate of the well based on that 5 5 4 cost and productivity studies extraction and transportation of water from the wells requires expenditure of money in addition the increase of drawdown and influence radius with continued discharge results in increased extraction costs moreover with the increase of discharge the drawdown in well influence radius and cost increases therefore it is necessary to estimate the optimal flow rate from the cost viewpoint after determining the optimal discharge according to the drawdown in the water table in the well the cost of the pumping and the phenomenon of subsidence the radius of the quantitative protection zone is estimated according to the amount of recharge therefore it can be concluded that the depth of the drawdown cone and recharge are the essential parameters for determining the quantitative protection zone and the influence radius is not very important 5 6 qualitative protection zone the qualitative protection zone which is often considered equivalent to the transport zone ites 2013 is a zone around the well that should prevent unauthorized pollutants from entering although the transport or discharge zones drawn based on travel time are reasonable references for this purpose more research is needed to provide an accurate guideline for determining the qualitative protection zone for this aim at least four studies are required to estimate a qualitative protection zone 5 6 1 hydraulic studies and investigation of the capture zone the real drawdown cone is a function of the water table slope and changes at different times of the year consequently the capture zone that is also a function of the real drawdown cone is varied at different times of the year this means that in order to determine the qualitative protection zone the capture zone and travel time zone are estimated at the minimum and maximum slopes and the larger values is selected to reduce the uncertainty risk jacobson et al 2002 rodriguez pretelin et al 2022 5 6 2 travel time studies for biological pollution based on the time required for the death of pathogenic microbes a travel time line can be drawn this line shows the duration of the water flow into the well the travel time line is a boundary where the duration of water travel from all its points to the well is identical for instance a 180 days travel time line is shown in fig 18 this line in terms of biological contamination is the upper limit of the qualitative protection zone in the capture zone although the number of 50 days to 1 year has been reported in some references moreau 2014 determining a more exact value for the travel time requires further research 5 6 3 travel time studies for chemical pollution after injection into the aquifer each polluting chemical has a special and unique fate depending on its dispersion diffusion absorption and advection phenomena these pollutants may be absorbed or dispersed gradually cao et al 2021 in order to avoid contamination of the well the qualitative protection zone must be considered appropriately wider than the capture zone and the travel zone 5 6 4 travel time studies for physical pollution although there no sources of biological and chemical pollutants may exist in vicinity of the well the physical pollutants may also change the water s turbidity smell and color therefore determining the qualitative protection zone is also necessary from this point of view and can be evaluated based on the travel time according to the previous explanations the qualitative protection zone is mainly a function of the capture zone therefore the overall shape of the drawdown cone significantly affects the qualitative protection zone while the influence radius shows no considerable impact on this zone 6 conclusion this research aimed to investigate the importance of the influence radius and drawdown cone in protection of the water wells the estimation of areas related to the protection of water wells mainly requires numerical models however a proper choice of grid and time steps is very effective in its results in this research modflow numerical model was used and its results were evaluated with moench neuman and theis analytical methods as shown in this study to estimate a drawdown cone with the relative accuracy of analytical methods for 180 days of pumping the grid should start with the size of the well diameter and gradually increase to the accuracy of the protection zone 50 m in this research on the other hand the initial time steps must be small and gradually increase in this research when the modflow results were consistent with the results of the analytical methods the time step started from a fraction of a second and increased to 3 days in the end after confirming the results of the models the effects of different aquifer and well parameters on the drawdown cone and influence radius were evaluated the drawdown cone and influence radius were calculated and compared with those of some analytical and empirical methods it was found that the methods based on the assumptions of cooper and jacob thiem and dupuit as well as the experimental methods estimate an area of the drawdown cone in which significant percentages of the volume and flow are ignored in our example more than 30 of the volume and more than 55 of flow rate in all infinite homogeneous isotropic and uncharged or uniformly recharged aquifers the drawdown cone is almost symmetrical with a circular surface view and the asymmetry observed in inclined aquifers is the effect of the water surface slope the theoretical drawdown cone of the well combines with the sloped water table and creates an real drawdown cone this real drawdown cone which is asymmetric in the central part is observed in the flow net as several closed and open contour curves it must be noted that the stagnation point is the outer limit of the closed contour curves in the drawdown cones the outer limit of the real drawdown cone is similar to that of the theoretical drawdown cone and it is almost symmetrical and circular due to the uncertainty of the effective parameters that control the shape of the drawdown cone it is necessary to be aware of the limits of their effect on the other hand the processes such as dispersion and diffusion enable transfer of the pollution outside the capture zone into the well therefore in order to determine the well protection zone more precisely it is suggested that all the influential factors are investigated separately with their uncertainty and then a final decision is made the current study also showed that almost all the areas related to the well protection zone are functions of the flow net and recharge the flow net are calculated and drawn based on all the decline curves the last closed curve that is drawn based on the influence radius is only one of the drawdown cone curves and cannot alone be an effective indicator in determining the well protection zones it was suggested that when the influence radius is necessary to visualize the size of the drawdown cone accurate methods such as modflow theis neuman and moench are preferred and the equations with uncertain assumptions must be avoided it seems that the drawdown of the inflection point could be used for significant drawdowns in definition of the influence radius this unique drawdown can transform the influence radius to a definite parameter credit authorship contribution statement amin ahmadi conceptualization methodology data curation investigation

2519,determining a suitable protection zone around the pumping well is necessary to protect the quantity and quality of water multiple researchers have facilitated the determination of protective zones around the pumping wells by introducing specific definitions concepts such as influence zone capture zone transport zone and wellhead protection zone and developing analytical and numerical methods however determining the quantitative and qualitative protection zones is still challenging the influence zone is a region where the water level decreases due to well discharge since most concepts of protective zones depend on the influence zone the current study focused on investigation of the drawdown cone and influence radius as two characteristics of the influence zone investigations were performed using the numerical modflow model and the results were compared with some analytical models including moench neuman theis etc the entire drawdown cone was considered to determine the protection zones of the pumping well the influence radius solely represented one of the drawdown cone curves and when calculated by the uncertain assumptions methods significant amounts of volume and flow in the drawdown cone are ignored the influence radius could not be considered as a definitive parameter as this radial distance strongly depends on the definition keywords influence radius drawdown cone well protection zone analytical model numerical model data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction there are many types of aquifers that in them the relations governing the hydraulics of the well are different the knowledge of groundwater and its usage by wells and qanats goes back to thousands of years however what is currently available in the form of mathematical equations relies on the pioneer study of darcy 1856 determination of the protection zone of a pumping well generally depends on the shape of the water table prior pumping and the shape of the drawdown cone after pumping darcy formulated the relationship between the gradient of the water table and hydraulic conductivity dupuit 1863 assumed the existence of a pumping well in the center of a circular island and derived an equation to compute the water level around the well thiem 1906 later replaced the assumption of a circular island with an infinite aquifer and applied the dupuit equation to calculate the drawdown cone in infinite aquifers houben and batelaan 2022 theis 1935 formulated transient radial flow to pumping wells and presented a solution that led to a significant progress in well hydraulics despite theis s solution was originally derived for confined aquifers this approach is also applicable for unconfined aquifers provided that the drawdown in the aquifer is small neuman 1972 1974 and moench 1997 also offered two solutions for drawdown around pumping wells in unconfined aquifers which included more details about the pumping well observation well and aquifer characteristics these three equations incorporate the time variable with capability to calculate the influence radius in transient conditions the analytical solutions such as neuman moench and theis are derived based on the analytical mathematics and comprise a number of components that must be approximated by iterative methods although the limitations for matching the natural conditions of the aquifer and well are relatively higher in theis solution this method is often preferred due to its simplicity furthermore several algebraic solutions have been introduced to solve this equation with high accuracy theis equation applies an exponential integral where its values are obtained from pre prepared tables or approximating formulas published by cooper and jacob 1946 with less accuracy as well as barry et al 2000 and watankhah 2014 with high accuracy during the evolution of well hydraulic science various researchers tried to simulate the flow around the pumping well and estimate the influence radius a number of empirical or analytical equations have been proposed with steady or unsteady flow assumptions some of those equations have been mentioned by lemke in 1886 bear 1979 schultze 1924 siechart and kyrieleis in 1930 louwyck et al 2022 de glee 1930 muskat 1934 weber bear 1979 hurst bresciani et al 2020 vanpoolen bresciani et al 2020 lee bresciani et al 2020 wilbur zhai et al 2021 and kusakin zhai et al 2021 all these equations include simplifications for pertinence with limited data and convert the complex hydrogeological situations to more straightforward hydrogeological ones however with the aid of high speed processing computers the methods that consider more details about the pumping well and aquifer have received increasing attention the approaches based on the steady flow assumption as well as those proposed by cooper and jacob for unsteady conditions are inaccurate for calculation of the influence radius bresciani et al 2020 dragoni 1998 zhai et al 2021 the influence radius is defined as a radial distance around the well where the pumping influence is significant bresciani et al 2020 however the term significant is inaccurate and may be interpreted differently in varied applications bresciani et al 2020 showed that this term could be calculated based on absolute drawdown relative drawdown relative flow or relative volume zhai et al 2021 believed that the influence radius calculated by the steady state solutions and the assumption of cooper and jacob is far from reality and even in their opinion influence radius presents no scientific or practical importance and could be neglected in the discussion on water resources protection louwyck et al 2022 accepted the invalidity of some old equations but they still believe that if theoretically justified these equations can be useful for calculating the influence radius and groundwater management motyka and d obyrn 2022 discussed different methods for determining the influence radius and highlighted their advantages and drawbacks as well as some practical problems in estimation of this concept the numerical models such as modflow are known as promising tools for calculation of the three dimensional drawdown cone which represent the actual conditions of the aquifer and pumping wells with relatively higher accuracy compared to the analytical approaches the drawdown cone and the influence zone computed using the numerical models are more accurate and provide a reliable protection zone of the pumping wells on the other hand the high preparation cost of the three dimensional models of the aquifer is a challenge for determining the protection zone of a pumping well the cost limitation of the numerical models makes the analytical and semi analytical models as viable options for calculating the influence zone and capture zone examining the results of numerical models in different conditions makes it possible to find suitable solutions for correcting the results of analytical models therefore in this research the effect of various factors on the drawdown cone and influence radius was investigated using modflow numerical model and analytical models and its results can be used to correct the calculations of analytical models 2 materials and methods 2 1 the modflow capabilities used in this study modflow solves differential equations of groundwater flow in porous media based on the finite difference method indeed some new versions of this model are based on finite volume calculations langevin et al 2017 mcdonald and harbaugh 1984 1988 in modflow various packages have been provided to apply the external and internal boundary conditions these packages aid to apply the recharge and discharge sources in the aquifer with relatively significant accuracy the possibility of applying horizontal and vertical anisotropy and simulation of flow in multi layered aquifers is also available one of the valuable packages in this model is the multi node well package that provides screening at different depths also in this model the grids could be refined in different ways to increase accuracy in some points of the aquifer such as water wells therefore this model can be used to evaluate different parameters affecting the well drawdown cone 2 2 aquifer specifications and model design the accuracy of wells simulation in modflow is at the level of analytical models barrash and dougherty 1997 in this study a rectangular grid was used in modflow to simulate the well and investigate the effect of influencing factors on the drawdown cone and influence radius and finally the capture zone and the discharge zone the aquifer under investigation was an unconfined alluvial type with a saturated thickness of 100 m specific yield of 0 1 specific storage of 0 000001 hydraulic conductivity of 10 m d and almost an infinite size of 60 km 60 km a well located in the center of the aquifer was pumped with a discharge rate of 4000 m3 d for 360 days the effects of the well and aquifer parameters was evaluated over 180 days the aquifer designed in this research was considered such wide that it could be assumed to be infinite thus its outer boundaries were chosen without flow the values of the above mentioned parameters were initially used to compare the results of analytical and numerical models during the investigations the value of each affecting parameter was altered in several steps within an acceptable range the above initial values were selected such that during the evaluation of the effect of each parameter their values could be increased or decreased up to ten times furthermore in these changes the well drawdown cone was kept distant from the aquifer boundaries the reason for choosing an unconfined alluvial aquifer with the above specifications in this study is due to their abundance in the nature the extent of exploitation in unconfined alluvial aquifers is often more than other aquifers furthermore the above values are almost equal to the mean values of the hydrodynamic coefficients of unconfined alluvial aquifers unfortunately the distance between the wells is not properly controlled in these aquifers and excessive exploitation of these aquifers arises from an insufficient understanding of the concepts related to the determination of the protection zone of the well the accuracy of the modflow model depends on the boundary condition grid discretization and the length of time step as stated previously the aquifer is considered such wide that the water drawdown in the well is not affected by the external boundaries on the other hand with repeated changes in two other parameters and comparing the results with analytical methods the appropriate values of these parameters were selected as follows gridding a well cell a cell of the aquifer in modflow where the well is placed was developed with dimensions of 0 25 m 0 25 m to 50 m 50 m with an expansion coefficient α of 1 2 in an area of 60 km 60 km the aquifer was designed in one layer with a thickness of 110 m and a saturation thickness of 100 m in some cases five layers of 20 m fig 1 stress periods in order to compare the results of the modflow model with those of analytical models and receive the results at the end of each stress period 360 day in 84 stress periods were selected according to table 1 3 theory and calculation for comparative evaluation of the modflow results it is first necessary to calculate the amount of water level drawdown at any time and distance from the well for all methods in this section the equations and a summary of the methods of solving the analytical methods of theis neuman and moench are presented the equations of other experimental and analytical methods have been presented in appendix a the moench solution method is an analytical solution presented for unconfined aquifers and its equation is as follows 1 h d r d z d 1 z d 2 p 1 z d 2 z d 1 z d 1 z d 2 h d r d z d p d z d the parameters of eq 1 are stated in muench s work including the bessel function of the second order zero types moench 1997 unfortunately this equation is set based on the dimensionless hydraulic head in laplace space furthermore this equation has no algebraic solution and its use requires computer programs after solving the water level drawdown for the average depth of an open surface of the piezometer at any time and distance from the well is determined neuman s solution method is an analytical solution method for unconfined aquifers and its equation is as follows 2 s r z t q 4 π t 0 4 y j 0 y β 1 2 u 0 y n 1 u n y d y the parameters of eq 2 are given in neuman s articles and include the zero order bessel function neuman 1972 1974 similar to muench solution this equation also does not have an algebraic solution and its use requires computer programs nevertheless this equation finally provides the water level drawdown for the open depth of the piezometer at any time and distance from the well theis solution method is an analytical solution method for a confined aquifer which is also valid in unconfined aquifers with a low water level drawdown and its equation is as follows 3 s r t q 4 π t u e x x d x s r t q 4 π t w u u r 2 s 4 t t the parameters of eq 3 are stated in theis s study and include an exponential integral function theis 1935 although calculation of the value of the exponential integral function requires a computer program algebraic methods are also provided for its estimation with reasonable accuracy this equation finally provides the average water level drawdown at any time and distance from the well in the current research computer code was used for all three mentioned equations also in the theis equation the approximation method of barry et al was employed eq 4 rewritten by vatankhah barry et al 2000 vatankhah 2014 this approximation can easily be used in programs like excel and for each u value the value of the exponential integral function or the w function is estimated 4 w exp u 0 5616 0 4385 e x p 2 2803 u l n 1 0 5615 u 0 4385 a 2 where a is 1 0421 u 1 u 1 5 1 1 0801 1 2 35 u 1 0919 1 comparing the results of the modflow model with the analytical equations showed that in less than one day the amounts of computational drawdown in the four methods did not match but from one day onwards the amount of computational drawdown is very close to all four methods fig 2 as a result the theis method could be the preferred approach for long pumping durations due to its more straightforward and understandable solution to calculate the drawdown cone and evaluate the zone of influence comparison of the drawdown distance s r results also shows that the drawdown cones calculated by the model and analytical methods are almost similar fig 3 shows the dimensionless values of drawdown and distance for 30 60 and 90 days the dimensionless drawdown s d calculated from eq 5 is equivalent to the value of exponential integral function or the well function w in theis equation the second power of the dimensionless distance r d 2 which is equivalent to u in the theis equation is also calculated from eq 6 5 s d 4 π t s q w 6 r d 2 s r 2 4 t t u as can be seen in fig 3 the results of the model and the methods of theis and neuman are close to each other for long distances and with minimal drawdown at sufficiently far distances the s values in the neuman and modflow methods were respectively estimated up to 10 5 and 10 6 due to cutting of the final values in the iteration processes in contrast this value in the theis solution could be calculated in even smaller quantities due to the algebraic approximation in this approach the results of modflow are equal with the analytical equations for drawdowns of less than 1 mm this level of accuracy is considered sufficient to determine the drawdown cone and influence zone 4 results 4 1 the effects of influential factors on the drawdown cone and influence radius 4 1 1 investigating the effect of transmissivity hydraulic conductivity and saturation thickness the transmissivity t is the product of the aquifer s hydraulic conductivity coefficient and saturation thickness therefore the effects of changes in these three parameters on the drawdown cone and influence radius are similar in the theis equation eq 3 t is appeared in two ways in u value as well as a coefficient for w as w itself is a function of u both w and the coefficient of w are affected by alteration of the t value in other words the effect of t on drawdown is different at varied distances from the well for instance increase of t in close distances causes a decrease in drawdown whereas in far distances it causes an increase in drawdown in other words with increase of t the drawdown cone becomes broader and shallower fig 4 shows the effect of t changes on the drawdown cone and the influence radius the significant part of the drawdown cone where the drawdown value is more than 10 cm is located at a radius of 2000 m at this distance the amount of drawdown and its related influence radius are decreased with increase of t from this distance onwards these two values are increased with the increase of t the remarkable point is that at a certain distance from the well about 2000 m in this case the calculated drawdown would be almost the same about 10 cm in this case for different values of t therefore selection of the absolute drawdown as the criterion for determining the influence radius leads to misleading results in particular when the value of absolute drawdown is not determined via a valid standard the obtained radius might be significantly far from the actual radius in this study the value of the influence radius varies from about 5000 to 13000 m for almost zero drawdowns while for a drawdown of approximately 10 cm the influence radius for different values of t is about 2000 m which shows that the drawdown cone is more important than the influence radius 4 1 2 investigating the effect of storativity specific storage and specific yield the storativity s in the unconfined aquifer is the sum of the specific yield and the storage coefficient the storage coefficient itself is the product of the specific storage in the saturation thickness in the theis method s appears in eq 3 in the u parameter with increase of s the u value increases and the value of w decreases and finally the amounts of drawdown and influence radius are decreased as shown in fig 5 with the increase of s the influence zone becomes smaller and this decrease in the volume of the drawdown cone occurs in both the surface and depth directions however the radial decrease rate is much higher than the depth decrease rate as seen with a 10 fold rise in the storage capacity the influence radius reaches from about 19 500 m to about 6 500 m the remarkable point is that with rise of the storativity the drawdown cone in a semi logarithmic scale changes its position uniformly towards the well not only upwards and its volume decreases 4 1 3 investigating the effect of pumping flow rate and pumping frequency the amount of discharge q in the theis method appears in eq 3 in the form of coefficient for w with increase of q the amounts of drawdown and the influence radius are raised the drawdown increase ratio is proportional to the discharge increase ratio thus when the discharge doubles in all points of the drawdown cone the drawdown value is also doubled since the drawdown around the well is high its amount around the well increases sharply with the increase in discharge but the amount of drawdown at distances far from the well increases with less intensity fig 6 shows the effects of increasing discharge on the drawdown cone and influence radius it is known that the increased discharges result in the surface and depth expansion of the drawdown cone but the depth expansion is much more significant than the surface expansion in this case with a 6 fold increase in discharge from 1000 to 6000 m3 d the value of the influence radius is increased from about 6000 m to only about 7000 m while for a distance of 10 m the amount of drawdown from about 1 m is increased to about 6 m pumping is one of the influential factors on the cone of drawdown perhaps the general idea is that when the well is shut down for few hours the major part of the drawdown will be recovered with this idea the time required to determine the influence zone may be wrongly considered equal to the hours of continuous activity the aquifer in this study was simulated for 180 days with a discharge rate of 4000 m3 d both continuously and at on off times to investigate the effects of successive and un successive pumping during the successive shutdowns the water volume coming out of the aquifer is reduced to half in 180 days thus the well was simulated with a continuous discharge of 2000 m3 d as can be seen in fig 7 the continuous activity of the well at all hours with discharges of 2000 and 4000 each creates a drawdown cone where the latter is broader and deeper than the former as shown in fig 7b the effect of non continuous pumping is observed only at a short distance from the well less than 100 m beyond this distance the overall shape of the drawdown cone corresponds to the total pumping time 180 d showing that the drawdown recovery time for long distances is much longer than the pumping time thus it does not recover in consecutive shutdowns as a result the total duration of pumping should be the criterion of action sum of on and off periods in determining the protection zone the required flow rate to assess the influence zone should be selected according to the ratio of the pump activity time to the total time the drawdown cone with a continuous flow rate of 2000 and discontinuous flow rate of 4000 have little differences at the beginning and end which is expectable as the flow rate of 2000 creates a smaller drawdown around the well therefore the width of the drawdown cone at the end becomes a little wider 4 1 4 investigating the effect of primary hydraulic gradient or uniform flow due to the water flow toward the well the water table around the well is reduced and a theoretical drawdown cone imaginary and invisible could be calculated for that the water table is also decreased by the natural flow in the aquifer the combination of these two drawdowns creates an almost conical water surface around the well which is the real drawdown cone objective and visible in an infinite aquifer with a horizontal water level the theoretical and actual drawdown cones coincide and when the aquifer is homogeneous and isotropic the drawdown cone is symmetrical in a sloping aquifer the theoretical and real drawdown cones do not coincide in the profile the real drawdown cone is proportional to the initial slope and asymmetric in the core but its symmetry is gradually increased finally the real drawdown cone coincides with the theoretical one in the maximum area and appears almost circular in the plan the effect of slope on the theoretical drawdown cone is shown in fig 8 the influence zone is almost symmetrical in the up and down directions and coincides with a significant part of the theoretical drawdown cone at different slopes up to a drawdown of approximately 1 mm and a radius of about 5000 m for the typical slopes the theoretical drawdown cones extracted from modflow are not much different from the drawdown cone with no hydraulic gradient thus the theoretical drawdown cone can be easily calculated with simple analytical methods such as the theis equation what is mentioned in the sources about the drawdown cone is about the real drawdown cone to extract with analytical calculations the theoretical drawdown cone should first be extracted with a method like theis then by subtracting the theoretical drawdown from the initial sloping water level the level of the real drawdown cone should be calculated in fig 9 the real drawdown cone is calculated for the initial slope of 0 010 for the desired well and aquifer as can be seen the influence zone and the real drawdown cone are asymmetric and very wide however the stagnation point has appeared at a close distance from the well about 100 m and this point is the end of the capture zone of the well 4 1 5 investigating the effect of pumping time and time after pumping time t in the theis method eq 3 appears in the u parameter with the increase of t the u value is decreased while w is raised which in turn results in increase of the amount of drawdown and its related value of the influence radius finally with at increased t the drawdown cone expands in both the surface and vertical directions fig 10 shows the effect of t on the surface and depth expansion of the drawdown cone the growth of the drawdown cone is faster in short times while in long times the development of the drawdown cone is slower a remarkable point is that by increasing a certain amount in t the drawdown cone expands at the surface and in depth moving uniformly away from the well on a semi logarithmic scale not only downwards for long periods increase of t again causes a minimal drawdown in the aquifer as it is evident in monitoring of the well water depth the slight increase in the drawdown raises the assumption of steady flow for long pumping intervals however this is due to our limitation in measuring and showing the drawdown changes in long pumping times with continued pumping after long intervals a minimal amount of drawdown in the well which is unmeasurable and ignored significantly expands the drawdown cone over long distances and stimulates the water flow towards the well after the pump shuts down the drawdown cone and influence radius continue to expand recovery of losses in a pumping well begins immediately after the pump is turned off a significant part of the losses is initially recovered while the recovery of the total losses continues for several times longer than the pumping at distances far from the well loss recovery does not begin immediately after the pump is turned off since the effect of the pump shutdown has not yet reached to this region at the points located near the maximum influence radius the pumping effect is received when the pump is turned off and then water table starts to decrease the reduction of the water level at this point continues for a long period several times longer than the duration of pumping after that a long time is again needed for recovery of the drawdown and reaching equilibrium it is noteworthy that the total drawdown is never recovered when the aquifer is not recharged fig 11 shows the drawdown recovery of the well and the observation well of our target aquifer at the maximum influence radius during pumping distance of 6748 m from the well when the pump is turned off the drawdown cone near the well becomes smaller and gradually wider at the end fig 12 examination of the shape change process of the drawdown cone indicates the possibility of extracting an inflection point on the drawdown cone when the pump is turned off the water level gradually rises for the distances before the inflection point and slowly falls for the distances after this point in other words the inflection point is the distance from the well that has the lowest drawdown during pumping and its drawdown is not increased after turning the pump off at distances beyond this point the drawdown value is increased when the pump is turned off therefore its radius distance from the well could be a proper reference for introducing the influence radius as seen in fig 12 the drawdown at the inflection point is about 30 cm and the influence radius related to it is approximately 1400 m therefore the maximum radius around this well that experiences 30 cm of drawdown is about 1400 m the influence radius of drawdowns less than this value is not unique and continues to increase after the pump is turned off 4 1 6 investigating the effect of recharge from the aquifer surface in the case of uniform recharge in an area much greater than the influence zone of the well the drawdown cone and the water level resulting from the analytical relationship can be modified for the recharge conditions any uniform increase in the recharge of the aquifer over the expected period will raise a certain amount to the water level of the whole aquifer therefore at the end of the expected time the aquifer possesses a secondary water level which is higher than the primary level the magnitude of increase in the water level of the aquifer in uniform recharge is resulted from dividing the amount of recharge to the specific yield when the drawdown cones are measured relative to the secondary water level it is observed that all the drawdown cones coincide for each recharge amount this means that the overall shape of the drawdown cone is not altered during recharge instead the drawdown cone only changes its position vertically and climbs upwards fig 13 shows the position of the drawdown cone and the effect of the well in the condition of no recharge and with a recharge equal to 100 mm in 180 days relative to the primary water level 100 m level and relative to the secondary water level 101 m level the secondary level is 1 m higher than the primary level because during 180 days of pumping 100 mm of water is entered from the surface according to the specific yield of 10 as can be seen the drawdown cone in the 100 mm recharge mode possesses a same shape however when the initial water level was considered as the base for measurements the water table was changed from 100 m to 95 m from this point of view the maximum water drawdown in the well was 5 m and the maximum influence radius was about 427 m in contrast when the calculations were carried out according to the secondary water level the water table was reduced from 101 m to 95 m in this case the maximum water drawdown in the well and the maximum influence radius were respectively 6 m and about 6748 m the slope of the h r relationship indicated that the drawdown cone moves uniformly to the upper side not towards the well at increased recharges therefore it is easy to modify the drawdown cone resulting from the analytical relationships for recharge conditions 4 1 7 investigating the effect of horizontal and vertical anisotropy anisotropy relates to the hydraulic conductivity changes in the x y and z directions for example when the hydraulic conductivity is high in the x direction and decreases in the y direction the drawdown cone slightly expands in the x direction and compresses significantly in the y direction this issue can be justified by considering the volume fig 14 a anisotropy in the vertical direction is more common in the aquifer however our study showed that in the saturated thickness range of 100 m and full penetration of the well its effects on the drawdown cone are insignificant fig 14b as a solution in case of anisotropy in the x and y directions the theis equation can be employed to calculate the drawdown in each direction using its corresponding hydraulic conductivity moreover in any direction the real drawdown could be drawn using the drawdown head in that direction 4 1 8 investigating the effect of partial penetration of the well in the aquifer the partial penetration increases the flow length around the well naturally it increases the water loss in the well and at high vertical anisotropies the effect of partial penetration on the water loss in the well and its surroundings is more significant in modflow it is possible to apply partial penetration with the multi node well mnw package in multilayer gridding by creating a 5 layer grid and screening at different levels the effect of partial penetration on the drawdown cone was calculated as shown in fig 15 the partial penetration has significant effects only up to a short distance from the well after that the drawdown cone resulting from different percentages of partial penetration coincides with that resulted from complete penetration therefore in the analytical calculations one can either use methods such as moench and neuman which apply the effect of partial penetration or ignore the effects of low partial penetration 4 1 9 investigating the effect of heterogeneity according to the knowledge of sedimentology in watersheds heterogeneity mostly has a specific direction and it is not a random phenomenon heterogeneity is mainly formed in the direction of sedimentation flow in alluvium both transmissivity and storativity are increased towards the upstream side of a basin on the contrary both these parameters decrease towards the downstream side of the basin it seems that these opposite effects prevent the expansion or excessive compression of the drawdown cone also there would be no significant change in the width of the drawdown cone in the left and right directions finally due to heterogeneity in the theoretical drawdown cone there will be successive changes in the water level it seems that these changes are less in the upstream direction and more in the downstream direction although there is no much change in its extent this issue has significant complications and requires an independent research 4 2 evaluating the drawdown cone based on different criteria as previously stated by using the theis neuman and moench methods for the desired aquifer and the corresponding well the amount of drawdown at each distance from the well s r is specified thiem s equation eq 7 for the unconfined aquifer is similar to the dupuit s equation 7 h r 2 h w 2 q π k l n r r w where hw and hr are respectively the water levels of the well and the aquifer for the effective radius of the well rw 0 249 m in the theis equation the drawdown value s in our desired aquifer was equal to 5 7264 m by considering an aquifer thickness of 100 m hw was 94 2735 m moreover for q of 4000 m3 d and k of 10 m d the water level drawdown for each distance from the well sr could be determined from eq 7 the cooper and jacob equation is presented for short distances and long times this solution which approximates the theis equation is presented as follows 8 s r q 4 π t l n 2 25 t t r 2 s in the desired aquifer for k of 10 m d and saturation thickness of 100 m the t value was equal to kb 1000 m2 d by considering the s q and t values of 0 1001 4000 m3 d and 180 days the amount of drawdown for each distance from the well sr could be determined from eq 8 in the studied well investigation of the drawdown in the period of 170 to 180 days of pumping shows that in the intervals of 1 day the change of drawdown was about 2 mm which might not be detectable with the standard measurement tools this small change of drawdown in the well is not necessarily related to the flow stability unless the dupuit s round island conditions exist or the well is located near an inexhaustible water source for comparison the drawdown cones obtained from different methods are shown in fig 16 although all the drawdown cones match at the beginning the drawdown cone of the thiem method gradually separated from other drawdown cones and estimated a smaller influence radius in contrast to the theim method the drawdown cone of the cooper and jacob solution corresponds more to the other approaches however this method is also separated in low drawdown values and estimates a relatively smaller influence radius the drawdown cones of theis neuman moench and modflow methods are identical from the beginning to the end up to a minimal drawdown of 0 1 mm and thus their graphs are shown in one color the influence radius of the thiem method is about 1558 m which is equivalent to the drawdown of about 26 cm in the real drawdown cone this means that the drawdown cone is neglected in the distance of 1558 m onwards in this method although this region plays a crucial role in supplying the water of the well this concept is also valid for the cooper and jacob method where the drawdown cone is neglected for distances above 2011 m 4 3 evaluation of the influence radius based on different criteria as explained earlier the influence radius continues to grow after the pump is turned off and thus it must be paid attention in management of the aquifer exploitation in this part the value of the influence radius of the well is only considered for the pumping period the general relation of the influence radius is as follows bresciani et al 2020 9 r c tt s where the dimensionless coefficient c is a function of q and the criteria parameter a function of the desired minimum drawdown the above equation is not valid for the aquifers with initial flow in these aquifers some of the water released from the drawdown cone never flows toward the well and continues along the initial flow for the studied aquifer and well the influence radius was calculated based on different criteria and methods it was also shown to what extent the choice of method and type of criteria can be effective in estimating the influence radius 4 3 1 absolute drawdown criterion the equations related to some methods are given in appendix a based on the absolute drawdown the calculated values of the influence radius for several absolute drawdowns are given in table 2 in some methods the influence radius differs significantly from the actual values however the values of the influence radius obtained by the theis neuman moench and modflow approaches are closer to reality 4 3 2 relative drawdown criterion the relative drawdown αrd is obtained by dividing the absolute drawdown around the drawdown cone to the absolute drawdown in the center of the drawdown cone in the theis method the influence radius for each relative drawdown is obtained from eq 10 using bresciani s calculations bresciani et al 2020 10 α rd s r s w r c tt s c 2 u α w u at a distance of 0 25 m from the center of the well the water drawdown is 5 7264 m for these distance and drawdown values the well function w is extracted and multiplied by α to obtain a new w the u value is extracted for this new w and finally c and r are calculated based on this the influence radius in the studied well and the aquifer were calculated for several αrd values as shown in table 3 a significant part of the drawdown cone is located at a distance far from αrd of 1 after r 2548 m as can be seen the αrd concept provides a better understanding than the drawdown cone 4 3 3 relative flow rate criterion based on the relative flow criterion it is possible to estimate the influence radius for each value of the relative flow at the end of the drawdown cone the relative flow is obtained by dividing the flow around the drawdown cone to the flow in the center of the drawdown cone well discharge and can be represented by αrf for example in the theis method the influence radius for each relative drawdown value is obtained from eq 11 using bresciani et al calculations bresciani et al 2020 11 α rf q r q w r c tt s c 2 l n α based on eq 11 the influence radius in the studied well and the aquifer is calculated for several relative flows as given in table 4 and fig 17 a when the initial water level in the aquifer is almost horizontal the relative flow shows the water percentage supplied by the regions beyond each selected point on the drawdown cone as it can be seen 99 of the well discharge is provided in a radius of more than 268 m while 1 of the well discharge is provided in a radius of more than 5755 m in the absolute drawdown table 2 it was shown that the thiem method at a distance of 1558 m and the cooper and jacob method at a distance of 2011 m show zero drawdown these values are approximately equivalent to 70 and 55 in fig 17a which means that the accuracy of the drawdown cone in these methods is such low that 70 and 55 of the well flow is ignored 4 3 4 relative volume criterion based on the relative volume criterion the influence radius for each relative volume at the end of the drawdown cone could be estimated the relative volume αrv is obtained by dividing the volume of the part of the drawdown cone that is outside a radius to the total volume of the drawdown cone in theis method with bresciani et al calculations bresciani et al 2020 the influence radius for each relative volume is obtained from eq 12 12 α rv v r v 0 r c tt s c 2 u f α f e u u w u α in this equation f is a new function similar to w extraction of the u values from the f u function requires a computer program and its value is estimated through iterative solving for each value of f α however in programs like excel by determining the relationship between f u and w eq 12 as well as the relation of w and u eq 4 u can be estimated for each α by trial and error on this base the influence radius in the studied well and aquifer was calculated for several relative volumes as shown in table 5 and fig 17b when the initial water level in the aquifer is nearly horizontal the αrv value indicates the percentage of the drawdown cone volume outside each radial distance in our target aquifer 1 of the volume of the drawdown cone is located at a distance of 4685 m and 99 is located at a distance of 101 m in the absolute drawdown table 2 the thiem method at a distance of 1558 m and the cooper and jacob method at a distance of 2011 m showed zero drawdowns these values are approximately equivalent to 45 and 30 in fig 17b which means that the accuracy of the drawdown cone of these methods is such low that 45 and 30 of the cone volume is ignored 5 discussion it is necessary to know the location of some aquifer regions to determine the well protection zone in other words experts consider the location of these particular areas in the aquifer as an indicator for determining the well protected area most of the research on the protection of water resources is related to the pollution issue in every country responsible organizations participate in this matter by preparing guidelines e g united state environmental protection agency usepa 2008 united kingdom environment agency ukea 2019 united states geological survey langevin et al 2017 pollock 1988 pollock 2016 winston 2019 institute of geological and nuclear sciences limited moreau 2014 united state army corps of engineers zheng wang 1999 and iran s technical and executive system ites 2013 2014 numerous studies have also explained some of the concepts related to the protected area and presented analytical semi analytical and numerical methods for their estimation barlow et al 2018 bica et al 2019 fileccia 2015 grubb 1993 khalilabad et al 2022 since many terms have been used in the related sources with occasionally interfering meanings these particular locations have been introduced again in fig 18 followed by discussing the role and importance of the drawdown cone and the influence radius on each of these points although the boundary conditions may differ from the water level slope the condition shown in fig 18 is often valid in watersheds in such conditions the water level of the aquifer during the rainfall period gradually rises due to infiltration usually the effective porosity is higher toward upstream of the basin and a more considerable amount of water is stored in the aquifer subsequently due to the higher water level at the boundary of the water dividing line a natural flow is formed in the aquifer this natural flow is not uniform and its amount is higher at the end of the rainy season the amount of this natural flow gradually decreases until reaching a minimum at the end of the dry season or stop and the water level in the aquifer becomes almost horizontal therefore the closed equipotential lines of the well in such an aquifer can change their shape at different times and experience other states i e from a circular symmetrical state to an elongated ellipse when the shape of the equipotential lines is varied around the well the range of the flow lines leading to the well is changed which in turn alters the location of the areas that play role in determining the well protection zone among the areas related to the well protection zones the followings can be discussed and investigated 5 1 influence zone the specific parameters of this region have been studied and mentioned under different titles drawdown cone or cone of depression the influence radius or influence radius zone of influence or influence zone etc this part of the aquifer is a three dimensional zone around the well where changes occur in the water table and velocity of water movement for definition of the influence zone it is necessary to mention the pumping duration and the minimum amount of water level change although this zone is three dimensional it is mainly shown as equipotential lines in the plan e g a 180 day influence zone for the drawdown of 1 mm 1 cm 1 dm 1 m 2 m etc the flow net plays a decisive role in determining the areas related to the protection of the well and thus all curves of the drawdown are important however the last curve which its distance to the well is called the influence radius with a drawdown close to zero is not alone very important the pumping duration is another influential parameter which could be determined according to the maximum duration of the annual dry period to estimate the influence zone in the studied aquifer a period of 180 days was chosen according to the effect of different parameters the depth and expansion of the drawdown cone during 180 pumping days are shown in figs 4 15 as seen table 2 in the studied well the maximum radius of the influence zone was estimated to 6748 m with the modflow model fig 18 it is noteworthy that the radius of the influence zone is not a unique number which varies based on different criteria tables 2 5 5 2 capture zone the capture zone has been referred under different titles zone of capture contribution zone etc there are still ambiguities in the definition of these expressions the capture zone is a three dimensional zone around the well that supplies the water of the well and the flow is passed through it in this definition both the pumping period and the pumping time should be mentioned 180 day capture zone in the dry period 180 day capture zone in the wet period and capture zone in a steady state the capture zone for flow in aquifers with the horizontal water level in both steady and unsteady conditions corresponds with the drawdown cone the capture zone for a steady gradient flow is a fixed volume of the aquifer enclosed inside the flow lines leading to the stagnation point fig 18 when two water sources with a constant level are imagined on the left and right sides of the aquifer however the phrase capture zone is ambiguous for the aquifers with variable slopes in this case both the theoretical drawdown cone caused by the well and the sloping water table are transient these conditions are more common than the previous ones and exist in most aquifers in such aquifers the theoretical drawdown cone and the water table slope are constantly changing through time resulting in a continuous change of the real drawdown cone the flow net and the direction of water movement due to the continuous change of the real drawdown cone the position of the flow lines and the movement direction of the water particles are altered at any time the effect of the slope on the drawdown cone is shown in fig 8 and fig 9 it was observed that the slope of the water surface ultimately changes the shape of the real drawdown cone in the analytical models by calculating the real drawdown cone and drawing the flow net it is possible to observe the direction of water movement capture zone at any time in the numerical simulators after calculating the water level at any time by models such as modflow the particles could be tracked by routing models such as modpath since the flow net determines the path of water movement all the drawdown curves especially high drawdowns play a more significant role in determining the capture zone while the last curve which represents the influence radius is not very important in the studied well the maximum radius of the capture zone was estimated to 6748 m at the initial water level without slope on the other hand the distance of the stagnation point from the well xsp was 360 m in the uniform flow with a slope of 0 002 and the maximum width of the capture zone 2y was 800 m fig 18 5 3 discharge zone the discharge zone has been expressed under different titles such as transport zone zone of transport travel time zone capture zone with pumping duration wellhead protection area with pumping duration etc this part of the aquifer is a three dimensional zone around the well where all its water is discharged during the pumping period and replaced by water from distant areas in this definition both the pumping period and the pumping time should be considered 180 day discharge zone in the dry period 180 day discharge zone in the wet period and discharge zone in a steady state at the beginning of the drawdown cone formation all the released water is not discharged into the well the discharged water is originated from the entire saturated thickness of the aquifer close to the water well the water removed from the aquifer near the well is gradually replaced by the water from the distant parts the volume of a part of the aquifer that is emptied and replaced during pumping depends on the storage capacity of the aquifer effective porosity the discharge zone is a small part inside the capture zone when the water level of aquifer is almost horizontal its outer limit can be calculated through equating the volume of the water of discharged of the well with the volume of a part the aquifer which supplies this water the discharge zone in the simulation models is estimated based on the travel time zhou and haitjema 2012 the discharge zone is identified using the capture zone which in turn is a function of the whole drawdown cone therefore the influence radius has no role in determining the limits of the discharge zone in the studied well assuming the equality of effective porosity and specific yield the maximum radius of the discharge zone was estimated to be 151 m in the absence of uniform flow in a uniform flow with a slope of 0 002 the radius of the discharge zone towards the upstream and downstream sides was estimated to be 175 and 133 m respectively fig 18 5 4 recharge zone recharge zone has been noted under different titles including contributing area contributing recharge area etc this part of the aquifer is often defined as a two dimensional surface of the aquifer through which the aquifer is recharged barlow et al 2018 this zone is a land surface in the unconfined aquifer which recharges the aquifer during rainfall however it seems that limiting the definition of recharge zone to a two dimensional surface is an obstacle for expressing its effect on the quality of the aquifer this region is perhaps an unsaturated three dimensional part of the aquifer where the discharged water from the well is infiltrated from its surface into the aquifer the recharge zone plays an important role in the biological processes and purification of polluted water zhuang et al 2021 in unconfined aquifers where the water level is almost horizontal the plan of this zone corresponds to that of the capture zone and influence zone in an unconfined aquifer with a sloping water table the plan of recharge zone only corresponds to the plan view of the capture zone and is much different from that of the influence zone fig 18 in the confined aquifer the plan of the recharge zone corresponds only to a part of the capture zone 5 5 quantitative protection zone this region has been given less attention in research and sometimes considered equivalent to the influence radius ites 2014 the quantitative protection zone means an area around a well where water discharge from the aquifer is permitted only through that well this definition does not mean that drilling new wells is allowed anywhere outside this area with this definition each well has a quantitative protection zone and the distance between two wells equals their algebraic sum more research is needed to provide proper guidelines for determining the quantitative protection zone and in addition to the indicators of the influence zone it is also necessary to consider the water balance in the aquifer unfortunately in the recent years the excessive discharge of aquifers has created many environmental problems in this topic the water quantity of well and the quantitative protection zone must be observed from the hydraulic point of view when the discharge capacity of aquifer is high the maximum flow rate can be allowed for each well however some limitations must be observed in term of the property rights as a rule every land has an owner who needs water to benefit from his land if the primary wells in the basin are allowed to over discharge other landowners encounter water stress therefore through implementation of appropriate regulations the owners could be allowed to use the aquifer in proportion to their land in the basin or increase their discharge share by artificial injection during the rainy season the water rights of each owner must be determined such that the water balance and water rights of the environment are maintained in addition to the property rights determining the quantitative protection zone of each well requires at least four detailed studies 5 5 1 hydraulic studies and investigation of influence zone fig 6 and fig 7 show the effect of discharge on the drawdown cone with increase of discharge the depth of the drawdown cone increased more strongly near the well and its width increased slowly at further distances for example when the discharge is increased from 2000 to 4000 m3 d the well drawdown doubles and reaches from 3 m to 6 m whereas the maximum surface radius is increased from 6200 m to 6748 m in other words in the most critical situation when two wells are drilled near each other their drawdown cones are merged in comparison with the drawdown cone of one well the resulting drawdown is slightly wider at far distances and two folds more profound near the well in this case the discharge of the older well is slightly decreased compared to its initial value as the pump is designed for smaller drawdowns however the pump in the second well is designed for larger drawdowns and thus could supply the needed flow rate consequently no severe limitation in term of the hydraulic drawdown is observed in the quantitative protection zone therefore the influence radius could not be considered as an action criterion in the studied well the values of influence radius for drawdowns of 0 1 and 10 cm were respectively 6748 4100 and 2400 m when influence radius is considered as the reference for the quantitative protection zone the minimum distance between two wells is the sum of their influence radius r1 r2 calculation of the influence radius assists to understand a conceptual model of a well however determination of the quantitative protection zone and the distance between wells via the influence radius could not be justified hydraulically and the result of water balance calculation could be seen as a more appropriate basis for this aim 5 5 2 water balance studies the essential issue in determining the quantitative protection zone of the well is to maintain a water balance in the aquifer on this basis it is ideal that the amount of uniform flow is avoided in the calculations to be safe for the environment and the quantitative protection zone of the well is considered as a part of the influence zone that can supply the well annual discharge through recharge therefore from this point of view the area allocated to each well in aquifer is a circle with radius of r which can be estimated from the following equation 13 q t π r 2 r e r qt π r e from this point of view in our target aquifer the well information is as follows the annual recharge re of 100 mm q of 4000 m3 day and t of 180 days on this base the area of the quantitative protection zone is a circle with a radius of approximately 1514 m this means that a circular area with the radius of r must be allocated from the aquifer for water supply of this well in this way the minimum distance between two wells is the sum of the radii of their quantitative protection zone r1 r2 this issue has also been addressed by zhou 2011 5 5 3 subsidence and porosity studies if the water balance is considered for determining a well discharge the possibility of subsidence phenomenon and the gradual reduction of porosity and specific yield would be low nevertheless the large fluctuations of the water level in the aquifer increase the possibility of the subsidence phenomenon therefore it is necessary to determine the maximum allowable drawdown in the well and estimate the flow rate of the well based on that 5 5 4 cost and productivity studies extraction and transportation of water from the wells requires expenditure of money in addition the increase of drawdown and influence radius with continued discharge results in increased extraction costs moreover with the increase of discharge the drawdown in well influence radius and cost increases therefore it is necessary to estimate the optimal flow rate from the cost viewpoint after determining the optimal discharge according to the drawdown in the water table in the well the cost of the pumping and the phenomenon of subsidence the radius of the quantitative protection zone is estimated according to the amount of recharge therefore it can be concluded that the depth of the drawdown cone and recharge are the essential parameters for determining the quantitative protection zone and the influence radius is not very important 5 6 qualitative protection zone the qualitative protection zone which is often considered equivalent to the transport zone ites 2013 is a zone around the well that should prevent unauthorized pollutants from entering although the transport or discharge zones drawn based on travel time are reasonable references for this purpose more research is needed to provide an accurate guideline for determining the qualitative protection zone for this aim at least four studies are required to estimate a qualitative protection zone 5 6 1 hydraulic studies and investigation of the capture zone the real drawdown cone is a function of the water table slope and changes at different times of the year consequently the capture zone that is also a function of the real drawdown cone is varied at different times of the year this means that in order to determine the qualitative protection zone the capture zone and travel time zone are estimated at the minimum and maximum slopes and the larger values is selected to reduce the uncertainty risk jacobson et al 2002 rodriguez pretelin et al 2022 5 6 2 travel time studies for biological pollution based on the time required for the death of pathogenic microbes a travel time line can be drawn this line shows the duration of the water flow into the well the travel time line is a boundary where the duration of water travel from all its points to the well is identical for instance a 180 days travel time line is shown in fig 18 this line in terms of biological contamination is the upper limit of the qualitative protection zone in the capture zone although the number of 50 days to 1 year has been reported in some references moreau 2014 determining a more exact value for the travel time requires further research 5 6 3 travel time studies for chemical pollution after injection into the aquifer each polluting chemical has a special and unique fate depending on its dispersion diffusion absorption and advection phenomena these pollutants may be absorbed or dispersed gradually cao et al 2021 in order to avoid contamination of the well the qualitative protection zone must be considered appropriately wider than the capture zone and the travel zone 5 6 4 travel time studies for physical pollution although there no sources of biological and chemical pollutants may exist in vicinity of the well the physical pollutants may also change the water s turbidity smell and color therefore determining the qualitative protection zone is also necessary from this point of view and can be evaluated based on the travel time according to the previous explanations the qualitative protection zone is mainly a function of the capture zone therefore the overall shape of the drawdown cone significantly affects the qualitative protection zone while the influence radius shows no considerable impact on this zone 6 conclusion this research aimed to investigate the importance of the influence radius and drawdown cone in protection of the water wells the estimation of areas related to the protection of water wells mainly requires numerical models however a proper choice of grid and time steps is very effective in its results in this research modflow numerical model was used and its results were evaluated with moench neuman and theis analytical methods as shown in this study to estimate a drawdown cone with the relative accuracy of analytical methods for 180 days of pumping the grid should start with the size of the well diameter and gradually increase to the accuracy of the protection zone 50 m in this research on the other hand the initial time steps must be small and gradually increase in this research when the modflow results were consistent with the results of the analytical methods the time step started from a fraction of a second and increased to 3 days in the end after confirming the results of the models the effects of different aquifer and well parameters on the drawdown cone and influence radius were evaluated the drawdown cone and influence radius were calculated and compared with those of some analytical and empirical methods it was found that the methods based on the assumptions of cooper and jacob thiem and dupuit as well as the experimental methods estimate an area of the drawdown cone in which significant percentages of the volume and flow are ignored in our example more than 30 of the volume and more than 55 of flow rate in all infinite homogeneous isotropic and uncharged or uniformly recharged aquifers the drawdown cone is almost symmetrical with a circular surface view and the asymmetry observed in inclined aquifers is the effect of the water surface slope the theoretical drawdown cone of the well combines with the sloped water table and creates an real drawdown cone this real drawdown cone which is asymmetric in the central part is observed in the flow net as several closed and open contour curves it must be noted that the stagnation point is the outer limit of the closed contour curves in the drawdown cones the outer limit of the real drawdown cone is similar to that of the theoretical drawdown cone and it is almost symmetrical and circular due to the uncertainty of the effective parameters that control the shape of the drawdown cone it is necessary to be aware of the limits of their effect on the other hand the processes such as dispersion and diffusion enable transfer of the pollution outside the capture zone into the well therefore in order to determine the well protection zone more precisely it is suggested that all the influential factors are investigated separately with their uncertainty and then a final decision is made the current study also showed that almost all the areas related to the well protection zone are functions of the flow net and recharge the flow net are calculated and drawn based on all the decline curves the last closed curve that is drawn based on the influence radius is only one of the drawdown cone curves and cannot alone be an effective indicator in determining the well protection zones it was suggested that when the influence radius is necessary to visualize the size of the drawdown cone accurate methods such as modflow theis neuman and moench are preferred and the equations with uncertain assumptions must be avoided it seems that the drawdown of the inflection point could be used for significant drawdowns in definition of the influence radius this unique drawdown can transform the influence radius to a definite parameter credit authorship contribution statement amin ahmadi conceptualization methodology data curation investigation
