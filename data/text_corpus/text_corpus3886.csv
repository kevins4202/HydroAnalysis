19430,the advantages of polychromatic ultraviolet uv light for viral disinfection can be optimized for disinfection using emerging tailored wavelength sources including krcl excimer lamps and light emitting diodes leds disinfection of the common viral surrogate ms2 bacteriophage was measured after exposure to these emerging sources and conventional low pressure lp mercury uv lamps in individual or sequential exposures the first dose response for any virus ms2 exposed to a krcl excimer lamp is reported showing the high efficiency of fluence based disinfection because of increased viral susceptibility at the low wavelengths emitted by the excilamp sequential exposure dose responses indicated synergy from sequential exposures of lp and excimer lamps which were competitive on an electrical basis at worst and best case scenarios of wall plug efficiency with current medium pressure mp disinfection best case scenarios for electrical efficiency also showed all sequential

requirement coupled with the groundwater rule statement us epa 2006c that it is not possible to validate uv systems for such a high dose has handicapped the use of uv for some disinfection applications however the demonstration of increased efficiency for polychromatic mp uv indicates the possibility to optimize uv disinfection based on wavelength additionally recent research adams 2016 on innovative validation practices for mp reactors has led to drafted federal recommendations enabling alternative approaches that account for polychromatic uv advantages especially at low wavelengths us epa 2017 recent advances in uv light emitting diodes leds and excimer lamps excilamps now offer the potential to gain efficiency over mp by utilizing wavelength tailored disinfection systems wavelengths are selectable for both of these emerging technologies by changing the semiconductor composition for leds or by changing the excited dimer molecule for excilamps chen et al 2017 oppenländer 2007 these technologies have improved electrical and cost efficiency compared to early models contain no hazardous mercury have long lifetimes suffer no damage from repeated on off cycles reach full power nearly instantaneously and can be implemented in diverse designs due to their small size and low power requirements chen et al 2017 hirayama et al 2015 ibrahim et al 2013 muramoto et al 2014 oppenländer 2007 pagan and o 2015 song et al 2016 past studies of simultaneous irradiations by multiple uv c led wavelengths demonstrated no synergy beck et al 2017b or negative impacts due to waste heat oguma et al 2013 indicating the need for research on the effects of sequential exposures that may allow more flexible designs the possible synergy from combining excimer lamps uv leds and or conventional lp lamps in a sequential exposure tailored wavelength disinfection system has barely been investigated one study demonstrated greater e coli inactivation in a flow through reactor with sequential exposure to krcl excimer followed by lp lamps versus the same reactor operating each source alone ramsay et al 2000 however uv doses were not determined and detection limits were inadequate to fully assess synergy another study examined e coli inactivation and genome damage from sequential exposures to various uv wavelengths using bandpass filters on an mp lamp poepping et al 2014 no studies have determined effects of sequential exposures on viral disinfection because uv disinfection depends on the spectral sensitivity of the target microorganism rather than source of photons the disinfection efficacy of leds or excilamps for any agent is equal to conventional mercury lamp uv disinfection for a given wavelength and dose combination a recent comprehensive review of disinfection literature for uv sources relevant to this study is updated and graphically summarized in supplementary figure s1 figure s1 demonstrates that bacteria and protozoa are easily inactivated at low uv doses while viruses require higher doses for inactivation figure s1 also demonstrates that lower doses are required by polychromatic mp for equivalent disinfection in all classes of infectious agents no study has measured viral disinfection by krcl excilamps ms2 bacteriophage is often used as a surrogate for pathogenic virus disinfection due to its ease reproducibility and safety of cultivation the spectral sensitivity of both ms2 the surrogate and adenovirus the regulated pathogen display marked increase in sensitivity at wavelengths below 240 nm and a relative peak in sensitivity at wavelengths between 260 and 280 nm as shown in fig 1 where their action spectra have been scaled by the lp uv dose required to achieve one log reduction at wavelengths below 240 nm adenovirus is more susceptible to uv disinfection than ms2 making ms2 a conservative surrogate for low wavelength disinfection studies these scaled action spectra also demonstrate that protozoan pathogens such as cryptosporidium and bacterial pathogens such as salmonella typhimurium are more easily inactivated than viruses at all wavelengths across the uv spectrum thus viruses in general and ms2 specifically serve as conservative estimators of uv disinfection across the uv c spectrum enabling wavelength tailored engineering optimizations based on virus disinfection most importantly fig 1 shows that disinfection can be optimized by selecting uv sources emitting wavelengths where infectious agents are most easily inactivated where dl is lowest this study sought to fill these knowledge gaps and take advantage of emerging mercury free wavelength tailored uv sources recent advances in quartz sleeves and sensors and drafted validation approaches to maximize the disinfecting power and resulting disinfection credit for every germicidal photon this study provides novel viral disinfection dose response from exposure to a krcl excimer lamp this study also investigated potential synergies of viral disinfection from sequential exposure to multiple uv sources finally data were modeled to determine if and how disinfection performance from sequential exposures could be predicted to inform wavelength tailored optimized uv disinfection strategies 2 materials and methods 2 1 uv exposures uv leds emitting at nominal peak wavelengths of 255 265 and 285 nm were used to target maximum nucleic acid absorbance near 260 nm due to their heterocyclic rings harm 1980 and the secondary peak of protein absorbance due to amino acids and minimally due to disulfide bonds near 280 nm anthis and clore 2013 a benchtop uv led system emitting these wavelengths was supplied by aquisense technologies earlanger ky a krcl excimer lamp emitting at 222 nm was used to target near maximum protein absorbance due to peptide bonds at 205 nm anthis and clore 2013 and was supplied by ushio cypress ca these novel non mercury uv sources were tested individually and in sequence with each other and a conventional lp mercury lamp to determine the optimum wavelength tailored disinfection strategy using these sources normalized emission spectra for uv each source tested in this study are shown in fig 2 uv

polychromatic lamp emission usb maya or maya pro ocean optics to determine sample exposure times bolton and linden 2003 linden and darby 1997 no additional weighting factors such as germicidal were used to adjust exposure times for single uv source dose responses the exposure time for each sample was calculated using the total uv dose for sequential uv source dose responses the exposure time for each sample for each source was calculated using half the total uv dose this experimental design is illustrated in the graphical abstract three biologically independent samples were irradiated and enumerated for each uv source or combination of sources 2 2 biological assays the ability to disinfect was measured via ms2 bacteriophage infectivity ms2 bacteriophages atcc 15597 b1 were propagated and enumerated using e coli famp host atcc 700891 using the epa 1602 single layer agar method usepa 2001 modified as a spot plating assay when viral titer was expected to be 102 pfu ml beck et al 2009 ms2 log10 reduction was calculated as the log10 ratio of pfu ml before versus after uv irradiation a minimum of 3 or 10 replicates were plated and counted for each dilution of each sample for pour plates sample volume 0 1 or 1 ml and spot plates sample volume 10 μl respectively frozen ms2 stocks of 1011 pfu ml were diluted in 1 pbs with continuous stirring between 5 106 and 1 107 pfu ml for uv irradiations 2 3 model and energy assessments disinfection efficacy was normalized to fluence uv dose and energy use electrical energy per order or een enabling comparisons between uv source combinations second order polynomial regressions with zero intercept were fitted to all observed ms2 log10 reduction vales at all uv doses for each single uv source or sequential combination of sources by lm in r v 3 4 3 using rstudio v 1 0 136 us epa 2017 2006b to compare measured ms2 log10 reductions in sequential exposures to single source uv exposures the modeled dose responses for

contributed half the total dose 8 e e n a d n 3 6 10 6 v c w f 3 results 3 1 single uv exposures the dose responses for single exposures of ms2 to each uv source are shown in fig 3 a the second order dose responses significantly differed as indicated by lack of overlap in 95 confidence intervals model coefficients and their standard error are shown in supplementary table s1 for a given uv dose or fluence the order of effectiveness of the uv sources tested for ms2 inactivation was krcl excimer lamp 255 nm led 265 nm led lp uv 285 nm led as indicated in fig 3b average of germicidal factors for these dose responses calculated at 1 2 and 3 ms2 log10 reduction corroborate the published action spectrum of ms2 weighted by each lamp emission additionally the dose responses for ms2 exposures to lp fell within the 95 confidence intervals recommended by us epa us epa 2006b for uv reactor validations not shown 3 2 sequential uv exposures the dose responses for sequential exposures of ms2 to the excimer and lp lamps where half the dose was contributed by each source are shown in fig 5 model coefficients and their standard error for these sequential dose responses are shown in supplementary table s2 the dose responses for sequential exposures of the excilamp and lp lamp in forward and reverse order were indistinguishable as shown by their overlapping 95 confidence intervals throughout the entire tested range from 0 to 50 mj cm2 the dose responses for sequential exposures of ms2 to the excilamp tested with the leds and to the lp lamp tested with the leds are shown in fig 6 model coefficients and their standard error for sequential dose responses are shown in supplementary table s2 for sequential exposures of the excilamp and leds ms2 was more efficiently inactivated for a given dose when exposed first to the excilamp than when exposed first to any of the leds the 95 confidence intervals for zero intercept second order polynomials did not overlap for forward and reverse sequential exposures of the excilamp and leds indicating statistical significance of the advantage of exposure to the excilamp before rather than after leds for sequential exposures of the lp lamp and leds ms2 was similarly more efficiently inactivated for a given dose when exposed first to the lp lamp than when exposed first to any of the leds again models and confidence intervals for forward and reverse sequential exposures of lp and leds indicated statistical significance of the advantage of exposure to the lp lamp before rather than after leds modeled dose responses of sequential exposures from figs 4 5 and table s2 are plotted for visual comparison in figure s3 with individual dose responses from fig 3 and table s1 as expected the ms2 dose responses for sequential exposures fall between dose responses for exposure to individual uv sources however as noted from fig 5 sequential exposures of the leds with either the excimer or lp lamps in forward and reverse sequence resulted in dose responses that were different from each other where greater ms2 inactivation was achieved for a given uv dose when first exposed to either lp or excimer lamps before leds dose responses for 5l 6l and l8 were very similar to dose responses for lp alone while l5 l6 and 8l were very similar to dose responses of respective leds alone 3 3 predicting sequential uv exposure dose responses because of the differences in sequential dose responses based on order of exposure and the need to design and optimize wavelength tailored systems without testing every possible sequential exposure combination dose responses for sequential exposures were predicted by several calculations equation 1 7 for methods f f f x and f y using single uv source dose responses fig 3 table s1 to determine if and how sequential exposure dose responses could be predicted plots comparing modeled zero intercept second order polynomial fitted to measured values versus predicted by f f f x and f y dose responses from sequential exposures of the excimer and lp lamps are shown in supplemental figure s4 rmse residuals slope and r2 comparing models fit to observed sequential dose responses to predictions f f f x and f y calculated using individual uv source dose response models are shown in supplementary tables s3 s6 the consistent overprediction by f and underprediction by f could be used as a conservative envelope for predictive modeling of forward and reverse sequential exposures of lp and excimer lamps the modeled and predicted dose responses combining the excimer or lp lamps with leds are plotted in supplemental figures s5 s8 and compared by rmse residuals slope and r2 in supplementary tables s3 s6 all methods underpredicted led last dose responses with the lp lamp all methods overpredicted ms2 log reduction for led first exposures the f overpredicted and f underpredicted led last dose responses with the excilamp again forming a conservative predictive envelope 3 4 electrical energy requirements the required electrical energy per order een to achieve a given n ms2 log10 reduction is shown for 1 n 3 for individual uv sources in fig 6a and for sequential uv sources in fig 6b data are shown for multiple log reductions because of nonlinear inactivation kinetics bars represent the average een and error bars extend to current best case min een and worst case max een scenarios the max and min een were calculated using the min and max water factors wf tested in this study and min and max wall plug efficiencies c reported in the literature for each uv source which are listed in supplementary table s7 for ease of comparison figure s9 shows single exposure and sequential exposure een for each pairwise combination of sources these data demonstrate that for single exposures fig 6a the lp ee1 min 0 029 and ee1 max 0 037 kw h m3 and excimer lamps ee1 min 0 029 and ee1 max 0 095 kw h m3 are currently competitive in energy requirements for disinfection while leds require roughly an order of magnitude more energy for equivalent disinfection results from well controlled bench studies can be directly compared to other studies such as one reporting eeo electrical energy per order of magnitude reduction based on linear inactivation kinetics for ms2 exposure to mp uv beck et al 2017b for current worst case scenarios of sequential exposures ee1 for lk kl l5 and l6 are already below the reported beck et al 2017b ms2 eeo for mp of 0 06 kw h m3 and 5l and l8 were close contenders with ee1 0 066 and 0 067 respectively for current best case scenarios of sequential exposures all but 8l and 8 k were more efficient than mp but were close with ee1 0 065 and 0 074 kw h m3 respectively indicating the current feasibility of more efficient wavelength specific targeted disinfection using these emerging uv sources alone or with conventional lp uv applying the same calculation for individual sources to various infectious agents using their scaled action spectra fig 1 and relative lamp emission fig 2 demonstrates in fig 6c that the predicted electrical energy required for adenovirus disinfection by the excimer lamp is on average lower than the lp lamp although the error bars representing the range of electrical efficiencies and water absorbance overlap for bacteria and protozoa disinfection salmonella typhimurium and cryptosporidium the lp lamp is predicted to be the most electrically efficient the low doses required to inactivate bacteria and protozoa make the electrical requirements for leds similar to those for lp and excimer lamps to inactivate viruses 4 discussion 4 1 krcl excilamps and uv c leds for tailored wavelength disinfection although dose responses for ms2 have been reported for exposure to other leds aoyagi et al 2011 bowker et al 2011 kim et al 2017 oguma et al 2013 zyara et al 2017 fig 3a presents the first published ms2 dose responses from exposures to leds with these emission spectra these data also include also the first reported dose response for ms2 bacteriophage or any virus exposed to a krcl excimer lamp for both the leds and the excimer lamp there was good agreement between germicidal factors calculated using modeled dose responses and germicidal factors calculated using the published action spectrum weighted by lamp emission fig 3b indicating corroboration with previous work that provides confidence in results from sequential exposures this agreement indicates that precisely defined action spectra can be used in conjunction with lamp emission spectra to accurately predict relative disinfection efficacy for emerging uv sources enabling easier design and optimization of tailored wavelength disinfection reactors the same approach can be used in conjunction with published lp dose response data to predict uv dose responses for infectious agents exposed to emerging tailored wavelength uv sources figs 1 and 2 these data can in turn be used to calculate electrical energy requirements to achieve pathogenic disinfection targets fig 6 which can direct technology advancement and water treatment technology decisions as an example these data fig 6c show that excilamps are currently competitive with lp uv for adenovirus disinfection in terms of electrical requirements these relative een predictions for adenovirus are comparable to a previous study beck et al 2017b comparing adenovirus disinfection efficacy by leds lp and mp uv which demonstrated that lp and mp were nearly equal in efficiency while the older leds required nearly 100 more energy although krcl excilamps are currently not yet commercially available for water disinfection these promising results indicate the need for more research and development of this technology especially in applications for viral disinfection further study is needed to determine life cycle impacts of excilamps for water treatment additionally because bacteria i e s typhi and protozoa i e cryptosporidium are inactivated by uv at such low doses leds could be used for bacterial and protozoan disinfection at similar electrical requirements to those currently required for viral disinfection by lp and excilamps fig 6c further study is required to fully consider tradeoffs between the flexibility in reactor design offered by leds the greater electricity requirements of uv leds until their electrical efficiency rivals visible light leds and negative impacts of conventional uv sources which contain toxic mercury chen et al 2017 muramoto et al 2014 shatalov et al 2017 4 2 imminent potential for partnering krcl excimer and lp lamps forward and reverse exposures of krcl excimer and lp lamps were nearly indistinguishable both on fluence and electrical bases figs 4 and 6 by combining these lamps in sequence viral disinfection can be enhanced over conventional lp uv technology at the same total original dose this could have implications for extending reactor lifetimes or allowing greater redundancy and resiliency by operating them at lower power to achieve the same level of disinfection additionally the sequential application of these lamps is amenable to diverse treatment train configurations using two smaller reactors installed in series versus one large lp uv reactor krcl excilamps could be added to achieve credits for viral disinfection by utilities who currently use lp uv for protozoan disinfection credits to enable them an easy retrofit installing krcl excilamps either upstream or downstream of their current uv disinfection although not studied here because ms2 is a ssrna virus which cannot be repaired by the photolyase enzyme another possible benefit of incorporating excilamps with existing lp uv is the lower potential for photorepair and photoreactivation clauβ et al 2005 oguma et al 2002 due to protein damage at low wavelengths beck et al 2017a and emission of much less photoreactivating light than conventional mp the targeted nature of emission with these wavelength tailored sources may also decrease the potential for formation of nitrogenous disinfection byproducts dbps compared to mp uv kolkman et al 2015 also excilamps have lifetimes similar to existing mercury lamps zhang and boyd 2000 and their efficiency is likely to increase with further technology development however the tradeoffs with potential low wavelength water quality impacts when using the excimer lamp require further consideration although the calculations of electrical energy requirements fig 6 account for water absorbance impacts from non target absorbance and results in other water matrices require further study 4 3 combinations of leds with krcl excimer or lp lamps on a fluence basis exposure to the excimer or lp lamps before exposure to leds resulted in greater ms2 inactivation for a given dose than by exposure to leds first fig 5 the reason for this difference is unclear but could possibly be due to the nearly monochromatic emission of excimer and lp lamps fwhm 3 3 and 1 9 nm respectively versus polychromatic leds fwhm 11 1 12 2 and 13 5 for 255 265 and 285 nm leds the difference is unlikely to be due to differences in incident irradiance in bench experiments all but the 255 nm led were similar 0 2 mw cm2 while the 255 nm led was 10 fold less another explanation for the combination of the excilamp with the leds could be reversal of photocleavage reversal of dna damage one study using mp with bandpass filters for 228 and 280 nm peak wavelengths used qpcr to detect photocleavage when e coli exposure to 280 nm was followed by 228 nm but found none when the order of exposure was reversed poepping et al 2014 this mechanism may depend on uv wavelength and or and nucleic acid sequence based on charge transfer promoting reversal of photolesions bucher et al 2016 szabla et al 2018 alternatively the difference could be due to differences in electrical operation both excilamps and mercury vapor lamps run on alternating current ac while leds run on direct current dc the effect of ac essentially makes the excimer and lp lamps deliver photons as a pulsed source with very high frequency pulsing leds has been shown to increase microbial inactivation efficiencies in liquids tran et al 2014 wengraitis et al 2013 and biofilms li et al 2010 future research could implement leds in pulsed mode in sequential exposures with other leds and optimize pulsing duty rate of both leds and excilamps to improve their efficiency since neither are negatively affected by on off cycles and both reach full power nearly instantaneously regardless of differences in order of exposure the best case scenarios for maximum wall plug efficiency and water transmittance for all sequential exposures were more efficient than current mp beck et al 2017b for ms2 inactivation fig 6b signaling the current feasibility of wavelength tailored disinfection using emerging uv sources leds and excimer lamps combined together or with conventional lp lamps due to the higher wall plug efficiency and lower water absorbance effects on wavelengths relevant for lp on an electrical basis the lp before and after leds were more efficient than the excilamp before and after leds again photorepair should be considered when comparing different sequential applications of uv sources recently 280 nm leds were shown to limit photorepair compared to lp uv 265 nm leds or simultaneous exposure to both leds which was attributed to damage of photolyase enzyme at the higher wavelength where protein absorbance is greater li et al 2017 additionally time based efficiency of batch and flow through uv led reactors is greatest with higher wavelength leds even if their fluence based efficiencies are lower due to higher output power oguma et al 2013 in this study emission measured at the same distance from three 285 nm leds was more than twice as powerful as emission by three 265 nm leds and more than 12 times as powerful as emission by six 255 nm leds as a result higher flowrates can be treated or fewer leds can be used for more powerful emitters while achieving the same disinfection which must be balanced with electrical efficiency another consideration for targeted wavelength disinfection is damage to multiple biomolecule types for instance ms2 rna is more sensitive to damage at low uv c wavelengths than high wavelengths while adenovirus dna is damaged consistently across the uv c spectrum but adenovirus proteins are more sensitive to damage at low wavelengths than high wavelengths beck et al 2017a 2016 2014a more work is required to elucidate wavelength specific and sequential exposure mechanisms of ms2 protein damage and wavelength specific biomolecular damage to other pathogens that may enhance disinfection 4 4 prediction and practicalities of sequential uv disinfection the different methods of dose response prediction can provide practical insight to designing wavelength tailored sequential uv systems tables s3 s6 figures s4 s8 based on previous methods of assessing synergy using f beck et al 2017b li et al 2017 both orders of sequential exposures of lp and excimer lamps resulted in disinfection synergy sequential exposures of lp followed by leds were also best predicted by the additive method but were underpredicted by all methods suggesting a definite synergy sequential exposures of the excimer lamp followed by leds were overpredicted by f and underpredicted by f sequential exposures of leds before either excimer or lp lamps were overpredicted indicating the potentially detrimental effect of this sequential disinfection strategy mechanistic reasons why exposure to leds after lp or excimer lamps resulted in less efficient disinfection of ms2 require further study the ability to predict dose responses of krcl excimer and lp lamps by adding their dose responses by the f method concurs with studies that have shown theoretically the additive disinfection of full scale uv reactors in series lawryshyn and hofmann 2015 young and lawryshyn 2017 the ability to predict sequential exposures of leds after excimer lamps using the envelope of f and f indicates potential to design wavelength tailored systems for optimized disinfection based on fluence and electricity use without having to test all possible combinations at the bench for sequential application of leds after lp the additive method alone could be used as a conservative predictor for disinfection optimization these predictive approaches can be used to design disinfection reactors to achieve specific disinfection targets within constraints such as electrical power cost and space 5 conclusions this research demonstrates current feasibility of krcl excimer lamps for water disinfection because their ability to target low wavelengths where viruses have greatest spectral sensitivity and their reasonable wall plug efficiencies make them competitive with current lp technology additionally the current feasibility of wavelength targeted disinfection that is equally or more efficient than conventional mp uv lamps was demonstrated using sequential exposure to excilamps leds and conventional lp uv lamps individual dose responses were well predicted using published action spectra but sequential dose responses indicated synergy on both fluence and electrical bases from exposure to the lp or excilamps before exposure to polychromatic leds the most electrically efficient wavelength targeted sequential strategy was forward or reverse exposure to excilamps and lp lamps indicating realistic possibility of retrofitting existing lp systems with excimer lamps to increase disinfection especially for viruses while maintaining the same level of electrical efficiency or decrease electricity use while maintaining the same level of disinfection the feasibility of sequential application of these emerging uv sources for water disinfection coupled with advancements in quartz sleeves sensors and validation recommendations will allow utilities to minimize their energy use while maximizing multi barrier public health protection funding this research was developed under the science to achieve

the spectral sensitivity of both ms2 the surrogate and adenovirus the regulated pathogen display marked increase in sensitivity at wavelengths below 240 nm and a relative peak in sensitivity at wavelengths between 260 and 280 nm as shown in fig 1 where their action spectra have been scaled by the lp uv dose required to achieve one log reduction at wavelengths below 240 nm adenovirus is more susceptible to uv disinfection than ms2 making ms2 a conservative surrogate for low wavelength disinfection studies these scaled action spectra also demonstrate that protozoan pathogens such as cryptosporidium and bacterial pathogens such as salmonella typhimurium are more easily inactivated than viruses at all wavelengths across the uv spectrum thus viruses in general and ms2 specifically serve as conservative estimators of uv disinfection across the uv c spectrum enabling wavelength tailored engineering optimizations based on virus disinfection most importantly fig 1 shows that disinfection can be optimized by selecting uv sources emitting wavelengths where infectious agents are most easily inactivated where dl is lowest this study sought to fill these knowledge gaps and take advantage of emerging mercury free wavelength tailored uv sources recent advances in quartz sleeves and sensors and drafted validation approaches to maximize the disinfecting power and resulting disinfection credit for every germicidal photon this study provides novel viral disinfection dose response from exposure to a krcl excimer lamp this study also investigated potential synergies of viral disinfection from sequential exposure to multiple uv sources finally data were modeled to determine if and how disinfection performance from sequential exposures could be predicted to inform wavelength tailored optimized uv disinfection strategies 2 materials and methods 2 1 uv exposures uv leds emitting at nominal peak wavelengths of 255 265 and 285 nm were used to target maximum nucleic acid absorbance near 260 nm due to their heterocyclic rings harm 1980 and the secondary peak of protein absorbance due to amino acids and minimally due to disulfide bonds near 280 nm anthis and clore 2013 a benchtop uv led system emitting these wavelengths was supplied by aquisense technologies earlanger ky a krcl excimer lamp emitting at 222 nm was used to target near maximum protein absorbance due to peptide bonds at 205 nm anthis and clore 2013 and was supplied by ushio cypress ca these novel non mercury uv sources were tested individually and in sequence with each other and a conventional lp mercury lamp to determine the optimum wavelength tailored disinfection strategy using these sources normalized emission spectra for uv each source tested in this study are shown in fig 2 uv

polychromatic lamp emission usb maya or maya pro ocean optics to determine sample exposure times bolton and linden 2003 linden and darby 1997 no additional weighting factors such as germicidal were used to adjust exposure times for single uv source dose responses the exposure time for each sample was calculated using the total uv dose for sequential uv source dose responses the exposure time for each sample for each source was calculated using half the total uv dose this experimental design is illustrated in the graphical abstract three biologically independent samples were irradiated and enumerated for each uv source or combination of sources 2 2 biological assays the ability to disinfect was measured via ms2 bacteriophage infectivity ms2 bacteriophages atcc 15597 b1 were propagated

ms2 log10 reduction was calculated as the log10 ratio of pfu ml before versus after uv irradiation a minimum of 3 or 10 replicates were plated and counted for each dilution of each sample for pour plates sample volume 0 1 or 1 ml and spot plates sample volume 10 μl respectively frozen ms2 stocks of 1011 pfu ml were diluted in 1 pbs with continuous stirring between 5 106 and 1 107 pfu ml for uv irradiations 2 3 model and energy assessments disinfection efficacy was normalized to fluence uv dose and energy use electrical energy per order or een enabling comparisons between uv source combinations second order polynomial regressions with zero intercept were fitted to all observed ms2 log10 reduction vales at all uv doses for each single uv source or sequential combination of sources by lm in r v 3 4 3 using rstudio v 1 0 136 us epa 2017 2006b to compare measured ms2 log10 reductions in sequential exposures to single source uv exposures the modeled dose responses for

dose responses significantly differed as indicated by lack of overlap in 95 confidence intervals model coefficients and their standard error are shown in supplementary table s1 for a given uv dose or fluence the order of effectiveness of the uv sources tested for ms2 inactivation was krcl excimer lamp 255 nm led 265 nm led lp uv 285 nm led as indicated in fig 3b average of germicidal factors for these dose responses calculated at 1 2 and 3 ms2 log10 reduction corroborate the published action spectrum of ms2 weighted by each lamp emission additionally the dose responses for ms2 exposures to lp fell within the 95 confidence intervals recommended by us epa us epa 2006b for uv reactor validations not shown 3 2 sequential uv exposures the dose responses for sequential exposures of ms2 to the excimer and lp lamps where half the dose was contributed by each source are shown in fig 5 model coefficients and their standard error for these sequential dose responses are shown in supplementary table s2 the dose responses for sequential exposures of the excilamp and lp lamp in forward and reverse order were indistinguishable as shown by their overlapping 95 confidence intervals throughout the entire tested range from 0 to 50 mj cm2 the dose responses for sequential exposures of ms2 to the excilamp tested with the leds and to the lp lamp tested with the leds are shown in fig 6 model coefficients and their standard error for sequential dose responses are shown in supplementary table s2 for sequential exposures of the excilamp and leds ms2 was more efficiently inactivated for a given dose when exposed first to the excilamp than when exposed first to any of the leds the 95 confidence intervals for zero intercept second order polynomials did not overlap for forward and reverse sequential exposures of the excilamp and leds indicating statistical significance of the advantage of exposure to the excilamp before rather than after leds for sequential exposures of the lp lamp and leds ms2 was similarly more efficiently inactivated for a given dose when exposed first to the lp lamp than when exposed first to any of the leds again models and confidence intervals for forward and reverse sequential exposures of lp and leds indicated statistical significance of the advantage of exposure to the lp lamp before rather than after leds modeled dose responses of sequential exposures from figs 4 5 and table s2 are plotted for visual comparison in figure s3 with individual dose responses from fig 3 and table s1 as expected the ms2 dose responses for sequential exposures fall between dose responses for exposure to individual uv sources however as noted from fig 5 sequential exposures of the leds with either the excimer or lp lamps in forward and reverse sequence resulted in dose responses that were different from each other where greater ms2 inactivation was achieved for a given uv dose when first exposed to either lp or excimer lamps before leds dose responses for 5l 6l and l8 were very similar to dose responses for lp alone while l5 l6 and 8l were very similar to dose responses of respective leds alone 3 3 predicting sequential uv exposure dose responses because of the differences in sequential dose responses based on order of exposure and the need to design and optimize wavelength tailored systems without testing every possible sequential exposure combination dose responses for sequential exposures were predicted by several calculations equation 1 7 for methods f f f x and f y using single uv source dose responses fig 3 table s1 to determine if and how sequential exposure dose responses could be predicted plots comparing modeled zero intercept second order polynomial fitted to measured values versus predicted by f f f x and f y dose

as a conservative envelope for predictive modeling of forward and reverse sequential exposures of lp and excimer lamps the modeled and predicted dose responses combining the excimer or lp lamps with leds are plotted in supplemental figures s5 s8 and compared by rmse residuals slope and r2 in supplementary tables s3 s6 all methods underpredicted led last dose responses with the lp lamp all methods overpredicted ms2 log reduction for led first exposures the f overpredicted and f underpredicted led last dose responses with the excilamp again forming a conservative predictive envelope 3 4 electrical energy requirements the required electrical energy per order een to achieve a given n ms2 log10 reduction is shown for 1 n 3 for individual uv sources in fig 6a and for sequential uv sources in fig 6b data are shown for multiple log reductions because of nonlinear inactivation kinetics bars represent the average een and error bars extend to current best case min een and worst case max een scenarios the max and min een were calculated using the min and max water factors wf tested in this study and min and max wall plug efficiencies c reported in the literature for each uv source which are listed in supplementary table s7 for ease of comparison figure s9 shows single exposure and sequential exposure een for each pairwise combination of sources these data demonstrate that for single exposures fig 6a the lp ee1 min 0 029 and ee1 max 0 037 kw h m3 and excimer lamps ee1 min 0 029 and ee1 max 0 095 kw h m3 are currently competitive in energy requirements for disinfection while leds require roughly an order of magnitude more energy for equivalent disinfection results from well controlled bench studies can be directly compared to other studies such as one reporting eeo electrical energy per order of magnitude reduction based on linear inactivation kinetics for ms2 exposure to mp uv beck et al 2017b for current worst case scenarios of sequential exposures ee1 for lk kl l5 and l6 are already below the reported beck et al 2017b ms2 eeo for mp of 0 06 kw h m3 and 5l and l8 were close contenders with ee1 0 066 and 0 067 respectively for current best case scenarios of sequential exposures all but 8l and 8 k were more efficient than mp but were close with ee1 0 065 and 0 074 kw h m3 respectively indicating the current feasibility of more efficient wavelength specific targeted disinfection using these emerging uv sources alone or with conventional lp uv applying the same calculation for individual sources to various infectious agents using their scaled action spectra fig 1 and relative lamp emission fig 2 demonstrates in fig 6c that the predicted electrical energy required for adenovirus disinfection by the excimer lamp is on average lower than the lp lamp although the error bars representing the range of electrical efficiencies and water absorbance overlap for bacteria and protozoa disinfection salmonella typhimurium and cryptosporidium the lp lamp is predicted to be the most electrically efficient the low doses required to inactivate bacteria and protozoa make the electrical requirements for leds similar to those for lp and excimer lamps to inactivate viruses 4 discussion 4 1 krcl excilamps and uv c leds for tailored wavelength disinfection although dose responses for ms2 have been reported for exposure to other leds aoyagi et al 2011 bowker et al 2011 kim et al 2017 oguma et al 2013 zyara et al 2017 fig 3a presents the first published ms2 dose responses from exposures to leds with these emission spectra these data also include also the first reported dose response for ms2 bacteriophage or any virus exposed to a krcl excimer lamp for both the leds and the excimer lamp there was good agreement between germicidal factors calculated using modeled dose responses and germicidal factors calculated using the published action spectrum weighted by lamp emission fig 3b indicating corroboration with previous work that provides confidence in results from sequential exposures this agreement indicates that precisely defined action spectra can be used in conjunction with lamp emission spectra to accurately predict relative disinfection efficacy for emerging uv sources enabling easier design and optimization of tailored wavelength disinfection reactors the same approach can be used in conjunction with published lp dose response data to predict uv dose responses for infectious agents exposed to emerging tailored wavelength uv sources figs 1 and 2 these data can in turn be used to calculate electrical energy requirements to achieve pathogenic disinfection targets fig 6 which can direct technology advancement and water treatment technology decisions as an example these data fig 6c show that excilamps are currently competitive with lp uv for adenovirus disinfection in terms of electrical requirements these relative een predictions for adenovirus are comparable to a previous study beck et al 2017b comparing adenovirus disinfection efficacy by leds lp and mp uv which demonstrated that lp and mp were nearly equal in efficiency while the older leds required nearly 100 more energy although krcl excilamps are currently not yet commercially available for water disinfection these promising results indicate the need for more research and development of this technology especially in applications for viral disinfection further study is needed to determine life cycle impacts of excilamps for water treatment additionally because bacteria i e s typhi and protozoa i e cryptosporidium are inactivated by uv at such low doses leds could be used for bacterial and protozoan disinfection at similar electrical requirements to those currently required for viral disinfection by lp and excilamps fig 6c further study is required to fully consider tradeoffs between the flexibility in reactor design offered by leds the greater electricity requirements of uv leds until their electrical efficiency rivals visible light leds and negative impacts of conventional uv sources which contain toxic mercury chen et al 2017 muramoto et al 2014 shatalov et al 2017 4 2 imminent potential for partnering krcl excimer and lp lamps forward and reverse exposures of krcl excimer and lp lamps were nearly indistinguishable both on fluence and electrical bases figs 4 and 6 by combining these lamps in sequence viral disinfection can be enhanced over conventional lp uv technology at the same total original dose this could have implications for extending reactor lifetimes or allowing greater redundancy and resiliency by operating them at lower power to achieve the same level of disinfection additionally the sequential application of these lamps is amenable to diverse treatment train configurations using two smaller reactors installed in series versus one large lp uv reactor krcl excilamps could be added to achieve credits for viral disinfection by utilities who currently use lp uv for protozoan disinfection credits to enable them an easy retrofit installing krcl excilamps either upstream or downstream of their current uv disinfection although not studied here because ms2 is a ssrna virus which cannot be repaired by the photolyase enzyme another possible benefit of incorporating excilamps with existing lp uv is the lower potential for photorepair and photoreactivation clauβ et al 2005 oguma et al 2002 due to protein damage at low wavelengths beck et al 2017a and emission of much less photoreactivating light than conventional mp the targeted nature of emission with these wavelength tailored sources may also decrease the potential for formation of nitrogenous disinfection byproducts dbps compared to mp uv kolkman et al 2015 also excilamps have lifetimes similar to existing mercury lamps zhang and boyd 2000 and their efficiency is likely to increase with further technology development however the tradeoffs with potential low wavelength water quality impacts when using the excimer lamp require further consideration although the calculations of electrical energy requirements fig 6 account for water absorbance impacts from non target absorbance and results in other water matrices require further study 4 3 combinations of leds with krcl excimer or lp lamps on a fluence basis exposure to the excimer or lp lamps before exposure to leds resulted in greater ms2 inactivation for a given dose than by exposure to leds first fig 5 the reason for this difference is unclear but could possibly be due to the nearly monochromatic emission of excimer and lp lamps fwhm 3 3 and 1 9 nm respectively versus polychromatic leds fwhm 11 1 12 2 and 13 5 for 255 265 and 285 nm leds the difference is unlikely to be due to differences in incident irradiance in bench experiments all but the 255 nm led were similar 0 2 mw cm2 while the 255 nm led was 10 fold less another explanation for the combination of the excilamp with the leds could be reversal of photocleavage reversal of dna damage one study using mp with bandpass filters for 228 and 280 nm peak wavelengths used qpcr to detect photocleavage when e coli exposure to 280 nm was followed by 228 nm but found none when the order of exposure was reversed poepping et al 2014 this mechanism may depend on uv wavelength and or and nucleic acid sequence based on charge transfer promoting reversal of photolesions bucher et al 2016 szabla et al 2018 alternatively the difference could be due to differences in electrical operation both excilamps and mercury vapor lamps run on alternating current ac while leds run on direct current dc the effect of ac essentially makes the excimer and lp lamps deliver photons as a pulsed source with very high frequency pulsing leds has been shown to increase microbial inactivation efficiencies in liquids tran et al 2014 wengraitis et al 2013 and biofilms li et al 2010 future research could implement leds in pulsed mode in sequential exposures with other leds and optimize pulsing duty rate of both leds and excilamps to improve their efficiency since neither are negatively affected by on off cycles and both reach full power nearly instantaneously regardless of differences in order of exposure the best case scenarios for maximum wall plug efficiency and water transmittance for all sequential exposures were more efficient than current mp beck et al 2017b for ms2 inactivation fig 6b signaling the current feasibility of wavelength tailored disinfection using emerging uv sources leds and excimer lamps combined together or with conventional lp lamps due to the higher wall plug efficiency and lower water absorbance effects on wavelengths relevant for lp on an electrical basis the lp before and after leds were more efficient than the excilamp before and after leds again photorepair should be considered when comparing different sequential applications of uv sources recently 280 nm leds were shown to limit photorepair compared to lp uv 265 nm leds or simultaneous exposure to both leds which was attributed to damage of photolyase enzyme at the higher wavelength where protein absorbance is greater li et al 2017 additionally time based efficiency of batch and flow through uv led reactors is greatest with higher wavelength leds even if their fluence based efficiencies are lower due to higher output power oguma et al 2013 in this study emission measured at the same distance from three 285 nm leds was more than twice as powerful as emission by three 265 nm leds and more than 12 times as powerful as emission by six 255 nm leds as a result higher flowrates can be treated or fewer leds can be used for more powerful emitters while achieving the same disinfection which must be balanced with electrical efficiency another consideration for targeted wavelength disinfection is damage to multiple biomolecule types for instance ms2 rna is more sensitive to damage at low uv c wavelengths than high wavelengths while adenovirus dna is damaged consistently across the uv c spectrum but adenovirus proteins are more sensitive to damage at low wavelengths than high wavelengths beck et al 2017a 2016 2014a more work is required to elucidate wavelength specific and sequential exposure mechanisms of ms2 protein damage and wavelength specific biomolecular damage to other pathogens that may enhance disinfection 4 4 prediction and practicalities of sequential uv disinfection the different methods of dose response prediction can provide practical insight to designing wavelength tailored sequential uv systems tables s3 s6 figures s4 s8 based on previous methods of assessing synergy using f beck et al 2017b li et al 2017 both orders of sequential exposures of lp and excimer lamps resulted in disinfection synergy sequential exposures of lp followed by leds were also best predicted by the additive method but were underpredicted by all methods suggesting a definite synergy sequential exposures of the excimer lamp followed by leds were overpredicted by f and underpredicted by f sequential exposures of leds before either excimer or lp lamps were overpredicted indicating the potentially detrimental effect of this sequential disinfection strategy mechanistic reasons why exposure to leds after lp or excimer lamps resulted in less efficient disinfection of ms2 require further study the ability to predict dose responses of krcl excimer and lp lamps by adding their dose responses by the f method concurs with studies that have shown theoretically the additive disinfection of full scale uv reactors in series lawryshyn and hofmann 2015 young and lawryshyn 2017 the ability to predict sequential exposures of leds after excimer lamps using the envelope of f and f indicates potential to design wavelength tailored systems for optimized disinfection based on fluence and electricity use without having to test all possible combinations at the bench for sequential application of leds after lp the additive method alone could be used as a conservative predictor for disinfection optimization these predictive approaches can be used to design disinfection reactors to achieve specific disinfection targets within constraints such as electrical power cost and space 5 conclusions this research demonstrates current feasibility of krcl excimer lamps for water disinfection because their ability to target low wavelengths where viruses have greatest spectral sensitivity and their reasonable wall plug efficiencies make them competitive with current lp technology additionally the current feasibility of wavelength targeted disinfection that is equally or more efficient than conventional mp uv lamps was demonstrated using sequential exposure to excilamps leds and conventional lp uv lamps individual dose responses were well predicted using published action spectra but sequential dose responses indicated synergy on both fluence and electrical bases from exposure to the lp or excilamps before exposure to polychromatic leds the most electrically efficient wavelength targeted sequential strategy was forward or reverse exposure to excilamps and lp lamps indicating realistic possibility of retrofitting existing lp systems with excimer lamps to increase disinfection especially for viruses while maintaining the same level of electrical efficiency or decrease electricity use while maintaining the same level of disinfection the feasibility of sequential application of these emerging uv sources for water disinfection coupled with advancements in quartz sleeves sensors and validation recommendations will allow utilities to minimize their energy use while maximizing multi barrier public health protection funding this research was developed under the science to achieve

19431,for ensuring microbial safety the current european bathing water directive bwd 76 160 eec 2006 demands the implementation of reliable early warning systems for bathing waters which are known to be subject to short term pollution however the bwd does not provide clearly defined threshold levels above which an early warning system should start warning or informing the population statistical regression modelling is a commonly used method for predicting concentrations of fecal indicator bacteria the present study proposes a methodology for implementing early warning systems based on multivariate regression modelling which takes into account the probabilistic character of european bathing water legislation for both alert levels and model validation criteria our study derives the methodology demonstrates its implementation based on information and data collected at a river bathing site in berlin germany and evaluates health impacts as well as methodological aspects in comparison to the current way of long term classification as outlined in the bwd keywords early waring bathing waters bathing water directive bayesian regression modelling abbreviations wwtp wastewater treatment plant loo ic approximate leave one out information criterion ppd posterior predictive distribution q flow in m3 s mle maximum likelihood estimate mpn most probable number fib fecal indicator bacteria p precipitation in mm d bwd bathing water directive eu european union pi ci prediction interval credible interval cso combined sewer overflow 1 introduction ensuring microbial safety is one of the key objectives of bathing water management the fecal indicator bacteria fib escherichia coli e coli and intestinal enterococci are the most frequently used indicator organisms for the assessment of microbial safety at recreational waters the european bathing water directive bwd 76 160 eec 2006 uses both indicators for quality assessment of marine and inland waters a major challenge regarding bathing water management is that concentrations of fib may show spatial and temporal variability triggered by different causes and occurring on different temporal e g seasonal monthly diurnal hourly and spatial scales e g along shore longitudinal depth us epa 2010 with respect to temporal variability the occurrence of some phenomena may follow regular and predictable patterns like tidal changes at coastal beaches or within day variability caused by uv irradiation boehm et al 2002 in contrast other reasons like event scale variation due to heavy rainfall may show more stochastic patterns traister and anisfeld 2006 the latter may lead to discharges from multiple sources of urban drainage systems like combined sewer overflows cso and stormwater discharges which both may contain high amounts of fib consequently event scale variability leads to the highest variations with respect to short term temporal changes of fib concentrations in surface waters us epa 2010 for this reason the european bwd demands to elaborate so called bathing water profiles for all bathing waters in order to identify the potential sources of contamination and to assess whether the bathing water is subject to short term pollution if the assessment reveals that a bathing water is expected to be subject to short term pollution the current bwd 76 160 eec 2006 article 12 c explicitly demands the implementation of early warning systems in order to prevent bathers from being exposed to contaminated water however the bwd neither provides guidance on how to implement early warning systems nor does it provide single sample indicator based threshold levels above which an early warning system should start warning the population bathing water quality is assessed only in the long term by estimating parametric 90th and 95th percentiles based on the surveillance data of the previous four years cf section 2 1 1 the lack of specified thresholds makes it difficult for the responsible authorities to justify and defend short term decisions about closures of or warnings on bathing sites an additional challenge regarding the implementation of early warning systems for managing event scale variability or short term pollution is the quality of available surveillance data bathing water surveillance in europe is only based on periodic at least monthly grab samples accordingly event scale variability is detected only by chance as pollution events may occur between sampling intervals kay et al 2005 even if grab sampling takes place same day a pollution event occurs the sampling time and the occurrence of the pollution event do not necessarily coincide in such cases the grab sample would indicate low fib concentrations which would be correct for that specific location and time if however it is intended to manage the bathing site on a daily basis as e g outlined in stidson et al 2012 the measurement will not contain the correct information regarding the management objective finally even if a grab sample indicates short term pollution no information is given about the duration of the contamination due to the lack of a single sample threshold and the limited information given by periodic single grab samples the prediction of bathing water quality as well as its validation remain a challenge studies which used statistical modelling regardless of using classification or regression approaches often validated the accuracy of the made predictions by using a contingency matrix approach brooks et al 2013 heberger et al 2008 herrig et al 2015 mälzer et al 2016 motamarri and boccelli 2012 stidson et al 2012 brady 2007 this approach determines specificity and sensitivity by the rate of false positives fp false negatives fn true positives tp and true negatives tn if however the validation data cannot be trusted to contain the correct information regarding the management objective e g daily bathing water quality a high false positive rate may be either the result of an overly conservative model or simply the result of random sampling error against this background the objectives of the present study are a to derive a decision criterion for early warning as well as to develop model validation criteria in view of the probabilistic character of european bathing water legislation and uncertain data b to develop statistical models which allow for day to day bathing water management based on official surveillance data fulfilling the derived criteria c to use event based sampling to check whether models are able to predict the duration of contamination in time scales relevant for daily bathing water management d to compare the proposed management approach to the current way of long term classification both in terms of microbial safety and methodological aspects 2 material and methods in order to be accepted by european authorities and beach managers alert levels for early warning should be related as closely as possible to the thresholds outlined in the european bwd therefore we first elaborate a general methodological approach for using the current numerical standards of the bwd as alert levels for early warning systems as well as for validating the quality of model predictions in a second step we apply the derived methodology at a river bathing site known to be recurrently affected by short term pollution finally we compare the suggested approach to the current way of long term classification in terms of microbial safety since e coli dominates bathing water classification in berlin meaning that elevated concentrations of intestinal enterococci without simultaneous increases of e coli are rare the study focuses on the prediction of e coli concentrations however the suggested method can be readily applied to other fib 2 1 methodological approach for deriving alert levels and model validation criteria 2 1 1 current approach of long term classification as set in the eu bwd the european bwd defines numerical standards only for long term bathing water classification to this end a probabilistic approach based on parametric 90th and 95th percentiles is applied the approach assumes that the measured data are log10 normally distributed and derives these percentiles by a log10 transformation of the measured data b calculation of arithmetic mean and standard deviation c calculation of the parametric 90th and 95th percentiles by 1 95th percentile μs 1 65 σs 2 90th percentile μs 1 282 σs and d back transformation from the log10 to the linear scale μs and σs stand for the sample mean and the sample standard deviation of a normal distribution n μs σs 2 bathing waters are classified once a year in view of the upcoming bathing season for this purpose the surveillance data of the four previous bathing seasons are used with a minimum of 16 samples in total table 1 summarizes the different quality classes ranging from excellent to poor 2 1 2 using bwd quality standards as alert levels for early warning in order to use the numerical quality standards of the bwd for early warning systems we need to a define appropriate alert levels and b increase the timely resolution from once per year to time scales relevant for bathing water management 2 1 2 1 defining appropriate alert levels regarding appropriate alert levels we are especially interested in the quality class poor since it is the quality we want the population to be warned of according to the bwd bathing water quality is classified as poor when the point estimate of the 90th percentile based on a minimum of 16 samples collected over four years and assuming a lognormal statistical model indicates that the probability of measuring values larger than 900 mpn 100 ml exceeds 10 consequently if we want to use these standards for early warning we have to predict a probability based on a lognormal model a way of estimating the probability of exceeding which accounts for the lognormality condition is to fit a linear regression model on the log10 transformed data and to use the predicted mean and residual standard deviation to construct a lognormal probability density function pdf in the usa heberger et al 2008 used such an approach to first calibrate the probability of exceeding of the single sample swimming standard of massachusettes of 61 enterococci cfu 100 ml the calibrated probability was used subsequently as a decision criterion above which the model would indicate impaired water quality in a european setting we argue that bathing water quality standards are already defined as probabilities of exceeding so there is actually no need to calibrate these values as they are already given by the bwd namely 10 for sufficient poor quality and 5 for good excellent quality thus we propose to estimate the probability of exceeding based on statistical regression modelling on the log10 transformed fib data and use these estimates as decision criteria against the percentile thresholds as outlined in the bwd in the present study we applied a bayesian approach for regression modelling therein the constructed pdf is referred to as the posterior predictive distribution ppd and the 95 prediction interval as the 95 credible interval ci of the ppd in general the equivalent prediction interval could be computed using a frequentist approach 2 1 2 2 increasing the timely resolution in scotland information systems are in place which inform the public about potentially impaired water quality on a daily basis stidson et al 2012 following this approach we use correlations between fib and readily available data cf section 2 2 4 to update our estimates of the probability of exceeding on a daily basis 2 1 3 validating predicted probabilities by percentage coverage a challenge regarding the prediction of probabilities is that they cannot be validated by comparing predicted classes to single measurements using e g a contingency matrix approach as an illustration if a regression model predicts a probability of exceedance of 20 the classification would be poor however if the prediction were correct we would expect 80 of the validation data to fall below the threshold and 20 to fall above it thus a single measurement gives no information about the correctness of the prediction moreover official surveillance data deliver only one data point per day so we cannot validate the true distribution for each day using only daily grab samples for this reason we focus on evaluating overall model consistency by looking at all validation data points at once if the model is able to capture reality from a probabilistic perspective 95 of the validation data should fall within the 95 credible intervals ci of the ppd 95 should fall below the 95th percentiles and 90 should fall below the 90th percentiles so e g from one hundred validation data points collected on one hundred days the constructed one hundred 95 cis of the ppds should cover 95 as these criteria are in turn subject to sample size based uncertainty we define a one sided cut off criterion based on a beta distribution to exclude all models for which the probability that the true coverage rate is 95 and 90 respectively is less than 5 a beta 1 1 is used as a uniform prior distribution we underline that fulfilling these criteria is no proof that the ppd predicted for each day is correct it is rather an additional minimum requirement which checks for overall model consistency with the test validation data 2 1 4 differences between suggested regression based approach and the approach for long term classification although both the current way of long term classification and the suggested regression based approach estimate the probability of exceeding based on a lognormal model there are some conceptual differences first the current way of calculating upper percentiles according to the bwd does not account for parameter uncertainty regarding μ and σ2 from a human health perspective we prefer including parameter uncertainty which leads to a more conservative estimate of the upper percentiles secondly current long term bathing water classification is based on the data from only four years in order to increase the chances that the training data include data influenced by short term pollution as well as to reduce parameter uncertainty we include all available surveillance data thirdly according to the classification methods as outlined in the bwd all variance in the empirical data is described by the variance parameter σ2 s of the lognormal pdf in regression the variance in the training data is partly explained by the linear model expressed as r2 thus the residual standard deviation decreases with an increase in r2 this relation will become important for model selection and validation cf section 3 3 2 2 application of the described methodology to a river bathing site in berlin germany 2 2 1 bathing site the bathing site kleine badewiese is situated on the river havel downstream of the city center of berlin germany the bathing site is an official european bathing water and is regularly monitored for fib during the bathing season may 15 to september 15 in berlin the usual sampling interval is 14 days from 2012 to 2015 bathing water quality was classified as poor while in 2016 and 2017 it was classified as good and excellent respectively due to water quality problems from 2012 to 2015 the responsible health authorities increased sampling frequencies to weekly samplings during 2016 and 2017 2 2 2 catchment description the sewer system in berlin consists of a separate sewer system in the outer parts of the city and a combined system in the city center fig 1 there are approximately 170 combined sewer overflow cso outlets in berlin heavy rainfall can therefore lead to discharges from csos and cso impacted river water which eventually reaches the bathing location in berlin flow velocities are usually very low depending on the flow q in the river travel times from the city center to the bathing site may range between 32 h and 14 days schumacher and storz 2016 in addition to the cso outlets the largest of berlin s six wastewater treatment plants wwtp is located upstream of the bathing location in dry weather the wwtp treats approximately 250000 m3 d in order to protect bathing water quality during dry periods the majority of the secondary effluent of the wwtp is not discharged into the rivers spree and havel but is pumped south and discharged into a bypassing canal the proportion of secondary effluent which is not pumped south is treated by an additional uv disinfection therefore only disinfected wastewater is discharged into the adjacent river in dry weather during rainy weather however water volumes are too high to be treated completely by the disinfection unit or to be pumped southwards consequently non disinfected secondary effluent is discharged into the river with a maximum flow of approximately 3 m3 s water impacted by these discharges will eventually reach the bathing site 2 2 3 data availability of fib and event based monitoring official surveillance data based on periodic grab samples from 2010 to 2017 n 114 were provided by the berlin health authorities lageso grab samples are measured using most probable number methods iso 9308 3 with a 2 fold dilution and a lower detection limit lod of 15 mpn 100 ml since biweekly grab samples only detect short term pollution by chance and do not give any information about the duration of a contamination refrigerated automated samplers hydreka sigma as 950 see supplementary material were installed for event based sampling during the bathing seasons 2016 and 2017 the main purpose of event based sampling was to identify periods of major fecal pollution from cso and wwtp discharges relevant for daily bathing water management samples were taken during the five days following rain events since impacts from urban wastewater were expected samples were diluted 4 fold in order to ensure that the upper detection limit would suffice samplers contained 24 1l pe bottles hach ps241000 each bottle was filled within 1 h taking 200 ml every 12 min samplers were cooled at 4 c samples were taken about 5 m from the riverbank at a depth of approximately 1 2 m prior to the actual sampling tubes were rinsed three times to avoid carry over for the transport to the laboratory bottles were stored in cooling boxes with cold packs samples were unified to 12 h composite samples the sampling bottles were washed in a laboratory washing machine at 55 c with de ionized water for 60 min and dried in a drying cabinet at 50 c the latter was considered acceptable against the monitoring objective of detecting periods of high fecal pollution from municipal wastewater due to logistic reasons laboratory working hours samples had to be collected around noon thus given that the initiating rain event occurred in the afternoon the first 24 h sampling period was stopped at noon of the following day this way the first sampling period was shortened starting times of the individual composite samples are presented in the supplementary material samples were analyzed for fib the afternoon samples were collected using mpn methods iso 9308 3 therefore the first aliquots of the first 12 h composite sample of the 24 h sampling period may have exceeded the recommended time period for analysis of 24 h by up to 4 h and might be under represented since the intention was to sample different rain weather conditions no specific threshold level for the minimum precipitation was defined due to the low flow velocities in berlin and the short driving distances to the bathing site automated samplers could be started manually by implementing event based sampling as an additional sampling protocol two distinct data sets are available the first one consists of official surveillance data based on grab samples from 2010 to 2017 n 114 with a lower detection limit lod of 15 mpn 100 ml iso 9308 3 the second one consists of 12 h composite samples collected during 2016 2017 with a lod of 40 mpn 100 ml n 118 as the data sets are distinct regarding the information they contain the two types of data were used differently for model checking and validation cf section 2 2 9 1 and section 2 2 9 2 2 2 4 variable selection for regression modelling for the implementation of an early warning system for event scale variability due to heavy rainfall explanatory variables for regression modelling were selected considering the following criteria a explanatory variables should be measured in high timely resolution b data should be readily available to minimize efforts for implementation and c there should be a plausible explanation for the effect of the explanatory variable on fecal contamination at the bathing site following these criteria precipitation p river flow q and the volume of the non disinfected discharge of the wwtp wwtp were selected as key explanatory variables the berlin water utilities bwb wwtp p and the berlin senate department for the environment transport and climate protection senuvk q provided the necessary data a more detailed justification for choosing these variables is provided in the supplementary material 2 2 5 variable construction and transformations due to changing travel times of cso discharges to the bathing site water quality at the bathing site might be impaired concurrently by both rain events that occurred just recently and rain events that happened several days ago the arrival time of the contamination depends on the river flow q in order to account for these kinds of variations different explanatory variables were constructed from wwtp discharges as well as from flow data q daily sums wwtp and averages q were calculated up to five days prior to sampling for each individual day q1 q2 q5 and wwtp1 wwtp2 wwtp5 moreover variables were constructed which summed averaged over multiple days prior to sampling e g q1 3 wwtp 1 3 represent the average sum over three days prior to sampling a similar approach has already been successfully applied by cyterski et al 2012 and herrig et al 2015 rainfall variables were created analogously with two exceptions first spatial averages over all 15 rain gauges were calculated before averaging over time secondly the created rainfall variables were log transformed a value of 1 was added before log transformation the rationale for log transformation is that while discharges of cso and stormwater may increase fib concentrations by orders of magnitude in the first instance a further increase in rainfall and consequently discharge volume will not increase the concentration further linearly on a log10 scale by log transformation the effect of higher rainfall levels is weakened the sampling day was not included in the averaging since in the case of historical data precipitation might have started after sampling creating artefacts of wet weather conditions when the sample might actually have been taken during dry weather conditions due to the lognormality assumption given by the bwd cf section 2 1 1 e coli data were log10 transformed values at the lower and upper detection limit were kept at these values 2 2 6 model formulations the constructed explanatory variables were used to construct nine different models table 2 gives an overview of the constructed models and explanatory variables using the notation outlined in section 2 2 5 models 1 4 focus on different times scales prior to sampling regarding wwtp and p models 5 7 include the wwtp with two individual days prior to sampling and differ regarding the rain variables model 8 uses only q and rainfall data p model 9 was created by stepwise forward selection allowing for pairwise interactions of explanatory variables and limiting the maximum number of explanatory variables to five interactions due to the low flow conditions and long travel times many discharges located upstream of the bathing site are only relevant if flow conditions are high enough to allow the fecal contamination to reach the bathing site within a certain time this dependency is considered by including interaction effects between p and q as well as between wwtp and q in statistical modelling interaction effects are included as the product of two or more predictors see table 2 thereby the effect of q depends on p and vice versa 2 2 7 model fitting all models were fitted using hamiltonian monte carlo hmc for markov chain monte carlo mcmc using the programming languages r r development core team 2008 and stan standevelopmentteam 2017b accounting for full parameter uncertainty in r the package for applied bayesian regression modelling rstanarm and the package function stan lm standevelopmentteam 2017a was used priors were based on the r2 statistic r2 0 8 2 2 8 data separation for model fitting and validation for model fitting and determination of regression parameters θ the historical data grab samples from regular bathing water surveillance from 2010 to 2015 n 74 were used for model validation both the collected event based samples n 118 and the surveillance data of the regular surveillance monitoring of the years 2016 and 2017 n 40 were used cf section 2 2 9 1 and section 2 2 9 2 the two validation years were very distinct the year 2016 was dryer than average with 89 of the annual average precipitation and low flow conditions in june july and august in contrast 2017 was one of the rainiest years ever recorded with precipitation of more than 200 of the annual average for the same months including a 120 year rain event therefore models could be validated against a broad range of different conditions 2 2 9 model checking and comparison normality and homoscedasticity of residuals were tested using the shapiro wilk test and the breusch pagan test respectively r2 was used to analyze how much of the variance in the training data is explained by each statistical model however since the proposed decision criteria for early warning are based on the upper percentiles of the ppd we are less interested in r2 but rather in whether the model is able to capture the variance in the test data thus the criteria outlined in section 2 1 3 were applied to each bathing season as well as to all grab samples 2 2 9 1 percentage coverage for the application of the percentage coverage criterion only the official surveillance data grab samples were used to ensure that the data for fitting and validating the model have the same quality for the individual years of 2016 and 2017 as well as for both years combined the minimum number of data points required to fall within the test intervals for validation of the 95 credible interval and the 95th percentile are 19 21 17 19 and 36 40 90 for validation of the 90th percentile the criteria are 17 21 16 19 and 34 40 86 validation data are considered inside the prediction interval if the best estimate of the mpn analysis falls within the predicted interval 2 2 9 2 graphical model checking the concentrations measured within the collected composite samples represent the arithmetic mean am of the fib concentrations during the sampling period model predictions are based on the log10 transformed data and consequently predict the geometric mean gm of fib concentrations in comparison to the gm the am is easier dragged to higher concentrations in case a pollution event occurs during the sampling period therefore the am can be considered a more conservative estimate of the average concentration during the sampling period than the gm reicherts and emerson 2010 for the assessment of model quality we used the composite samples for graphical model checking since composite samples give information about the duration of contamination at a 12 h resolution we used these samples to check whether the models are able to cover that 12 h trend see supplementary material 2 2 9 3 use of information criteria the approximate leave one out cross validation information criterion loo ic was used as an additional indication for the predictive performance of each model vehtari et al 2017 all calculations were conducted using the loo package in combination with the function loo vehtari et al 2016 the loo ic was calculated for both the training set as well as after refitting the models with all grab samples lower loo ic value indicate better predictive performance 2 3 comparison to long term classification with regard to health protection in order to analyze the health implications of the suggested management approach it was applied retrospectively to the years 2016 and 2017 for each day from may 15 to september 15 the 90th and 95th percentiles of the ppd were simulated using the posterior predict function standevelopmentteam 2017a and compared to the percentile thresholds as outlined in the bwd cf table 1 thereby bathing water quality was classified for each day using the hydraulic information from the days before the results were compared to official bathing water classifications complemented with official warnings communicated by the local health authority the latter are communicated via press release and are mainly experience based ad hoc decisions 3 results 3 1 checking for lognormality and basic models assumptions the individual test results for normality and homoscedasticity for each model are given in the supplementary material two models 6 and 7 out of nine models failed the normality test the residuals showed no heteroscedasticity a comparison of the normality assumption before and after regression modelling is shown in fig 2 results show that while both raw data and lognormally transformed data are not normally distributed regression modelling now leads to normally distributed residuals the latter justifies the use of a lognormal parametric approach for estimating the 90th and 95th percentiles fig 2 3 2 checking for percentage coverage the results of model checking against the percentage coverage criteria are shown in fig 3 fig 4 shows an illustrative example of the best performing model model 3 models which violated the normality assumption are not shown anymore from the remaining seven models only three model 3 model 4 and model 8 passed the applied criteria the 95th percentile test interval indicates to be the strictest criterion among the applied test intervals fig 5 shows the relation between the variance explained r2 and the different percentage coverage criteria for both validation years the model covering the highest proportion of validation data model 3 has the second lowest r2 whereas the model with the highest r2 model 5 value performs the worst this behavior shows that optimizing models only in terms of r2 may lead to overfitting and thereby yields to poor predictive accuracy applying the percentage coverage criterion instead reduces overfitting by ensuring that the model s residual standard deviation remains sufficiently high to reflect the variation in the test data fig 4 also shows that the standard deviation of the predicted distributions has to be very high sd 0 6 to cover this variation the ppd covers approximately 2 2 5 orders of magnitude 3 3 graphical model checking and information criteria times series plots of the seven models which passed the normality test are given in the supplementary material in order to visualize the temporal trends the confidence intervals of the geometric mean are connected by linear interpolation the graphical comparison to the 12 h composite samples indicates that the three models which passed the percentage coverage criterion are able to predict periods of severe fecal pollution however models 3 and 4 cover both composite samples and grab samples better than model 8 due to the lower loo ic value supplementary material of model 3 in comparison to model 4 model 3 is preferred 3 4 comparison to long term classification with regard to health protection fig 6 shows the comparison between long term classification based on data from the previous four years official classification and daily classifications based on model 3 the latter is based on the information and evidence contained in the training data from 2010 to 2015 fig 7 shows the related time series plots monitoring data grab and composite samples and periods of ad hoc precautionary warnings due to the low concentrations measured between 2013 and 2016 in 2017 bathing water quality was classified as excellent by long term classification however due to the rainy weather in 2017 the results from composite sampling after heavy rainfall reveal severe fecal contamination with measured e coli concentrations of up to 105 mpn 100 ml it is worth to mention that even weekly grab samples did not capture this contamination the results prove that long term classification only based on the surveillance data from the previous four years and not considering any other environmental conditions may lead to substantial misjudgments of the actual bathing water quality and may pose a hazard to human health in contrast by updating percentile estimates on a daily basis bathing water quality classifications would alternately indicate periods of better and poor quality predictions of poor comply with elevated concentrations measured in composite samples which represent 12 h averages the model generally shows high consistency regarding the results from both sample types however at three occasions marked with white arrows in fig 7 the model would have predicted sufficient water quality or better while the results from composite samples indicate concentrations above the percentile threshold of 900 mpn 100 ml at two of the three occasions 1 and 3 heavy rainfall 90 mm 12 8 mm on the sampling day itself could be identified as the cause for these high values however including rainfall on the sampling day as an additional explanatory variable in the regression model did not improve predictions for these days thus the information was missing in the training data with regard to observation 2 only minor rainfall occurred on the sampling day 2 mm however the approach presented demonstrates that health protection is improved substantially in comparison to the current way of ad hoc warning and especially in comparison to long term classification 4 discussion 4 1 comparison of proposed alert values to similar studies previous studies which focused on implementing early warning systems for bathing water management in europe used the 90th percentile threshold for sufficient quality either as threshold for classification models stidson et al 2012 for marine waters or compared the maximum likelihood estimate mle of regression models to this threshold herrig et al 2015 bedri et al 2016 mälzer et al 2016 used an even higher concentration of 1800 mpn 100 ml as a classification threshold each of these approaches tolerates that the bulk of the probability mass of the measured data is located very close or even above the percentile threshold when using the mle as applied by herrig et al 2015 the probability of exceeding is tolerated to be up to 50 when using the approach proposed by mälzer et al 2016 up to 100 of the data points are tolerated to fall between 900 mpn and 1800 mpn without warning if 900 mpn is used as a classification threshold 100 of the data should fall below the threshold on the other hand since the lognormal condition is not considered measured data would be allowed to be located very close to the threshold in contrast if the lognormality condition is considered the bulk of the probability mass has to be located much lower as to our case to determine sufficient water quality the evidence in the training data has to indicate that 50 of the data falls below 152 mpn 100 ml 80 below 488 mpn 100 ml only 10 between 500 and 900 mpn 100 ml and an additional 10 is tolerated above 900 mpn 100 ml thus the approach proposed is much stricter regarding the expected frequency of data between 500 and 900 mpn 100 ml while it will like the bwd tolerate occasional outliers fig 8 illustrates the tolerable ranges and frequencies the different approaches allow the data to fall in without warning 4 2 model validation by percentage coverage the introduced model validation criteria based on percentage coverage provide a suitable way to apply probabilistic model checking when only periodic surveillance data are available moreover it prevents overfitting and ensures that the residual standard deviation remains wide enough when models are intended to be used for prediction the latter is particularly important for low sample sizes the criterion has to be considered as an additional minimum requirement for checking model consistency against the test data and not as a proof that the predicted distribution represents the true variability during each individual day to validate the latter many grab samples in high timely resolution would be necessary however heavy rainfall the major source of temporal variation us epa 2010 and accordingly of health concern shows rather stochastic patterns therefore grab samples collected periodically over long time periods are likely to capture event scale variations in the end overall the approach showed very promising results at a large riverine bathing water site in berlin and should therefore be tested and verified at other locations and for other types of bathing waters 4 3 sources of uncertainty assessment approaches which are based on statistical inference i e which make decisions upon estimates of unobservable quantities like parametric 90th or 95th percentiles are always conditional on a the chosen statistical model b the quality and quantity of available data this accounts for both the currently used method for long term classification as well as for the proposed method for regression modelling 4 3 1 uncertainties resulting from random sampling error all statistical inference is conditional on the observed data in particular the estimation of high percentiles is subject to statistical error due to low sample sizes berthouex and hau 1991 moreover if by random sampling no short term pollution is detected and no other prior information is used to build the model a statistical model might not be able to make correct predictions due to both reasons inferences might be wrong however in comparison to the current bwd which only uses the data from the previous four years the presented approach certainly improves the inferences on bathing water quality since all available data as well as the information about their correlation to relevant predictors are used by updating models regularly as more data becomes available uncertainty will be further reduced over time 4 3 2 uncertainties related to the statistical model the estimation of high parametric percentiles of a log10 normal statistical model is sensitive to the choice of the lower detection limit lod the reason for this sensitivity is that e g the difference between 10 mpn 100 ml and 1 mpn 100 ml i e an absolute difference of 9 mpn 100 ml at the lower end of the scale represents a whole order of magnitude thus it will have a larger effect on the estimate of the geometric standard deviation as e g an absolute difference of 500 mpn between 500 mpn and 1000 mpn difference 0 3 orders of magnitude the bwd does not explicitly define requirements for the lod in the present study we used data from official bathing water surveillance with a lod of 15 mpn this lod follows recommendations according to the reference method outlined in the bwd iso 9308 3 therefore we consider this lod as appropriately low or at least in line with current european legislation however due to the sensitivity of estimates of high percentiles to the lower lod clear standards would be desirable 5 conclusions statistical regression modelling offers a promising solution to translate the existing percentile thresholds for long term classification to daily bathing water management the application of the derived percentage coverage criteria accounts for the probabilistic character of eu bathing legislation and reduces the risk of overfitting and thus overly optimistic prediction accuracy in comparison to optimizing models in terms of r2 event based monitoring provided valuable additional information about periods of major fecal pollution and model checking regarding microbial safety the application of the proposed methodology at a riverine bathing water site in berlin demonstrated the shortcomings of current long term classification as well as the potential for improvement by applying the proposed approach since statistical classification approaches do not account for the lognormality assumption preference should be given to

19431,for ensuring microbial safety the current european bathing water directive bwd 76 160 eec 2006 demands the implementation of reliable early warning systems for bathing waters which are known to be subject to short term pollution however the bwd does not provide clearly defined threshold levels above which an early warning system should start warning or informing the population statistical regression modelling is a commonly used method for predicting concentrations of fecal indicator bacteria the present study proposes a methodology for implementing early warning systems based on multivariate regression modelling which takes into account the probabilistic character of european bathing water legislation for both alert levels and model validation criteria our study derives the methodology demonstrates its implementation based on information and data collected at a river bathing site in berlin germany and evaluates health impacts as well as methodological aspects in comparison to the current way of long term classification as outlined in the bwd keywords early waring bathing waters bathing water directive bayesian regression modelling abbreviations wwtp wastewater treatment plant loo ic approximate leave one out information criterion ppd posterior predictive distribution q flow in m3 s mle maximum likelihood estimate mpn most probable number fib fecal indicator bacteria p precipitation in mm d bwd bathing water directive eu european union pi ci prediction interval credible interval cso combined sewer overflow 1 introduction ensuring microbial safety is one of the key objectives of bathing water management the fecal indicator bacteria fib escherichia coli e coli and intestinal enterococci are the most frequently used indicator organisms for the assessment of microbial safety at recreational waters the european bathing water directive bwd 76 160 eec 2006 uses both indicators for quality assessment of marine and inland waters a major challenge regarding bathing water management is that concentrations of fib may show spatial and temporal variability triggered by different causes and occurring on different temporal e g seasonal monthly diurnal hourly and spatial scales e g along shore longitudinal depth us epa 2010 with respect to temporal variability the occurrence of some phenomena may follow regular and predictable patterns like tidal changes at coastal beaches or within day variability caused by uv irradiation boehm et al 2002 in contrast other reasons like event scale variation due to heavy rainfall may show more stochastic patterns traister and anisfeld 2006 the latter may lead to discharges from multiple sources of urban drainage systems like combined sewer overflows cso and stormwater discharges which both may contain high amounts of fib consequently event scale variability leads to the highest variations with respect to short term temporal changes of fib concentrations in surface waters us epa 2010 for this reason the european bwd demands to elaborate so called bathing water profiles for all bathing waters in order to identify the potential sources of contamination and to assess whether the bathing water is subject to short term pollution if the assessment reveals that a bathing water is expected to be subject to short term pollution the current bwd 76 160 eec 2006 article 12 c explicitly demands the implementation of early warning systems in order to prevent bathers from being exposed to contaminated water however the bwd neither provides guidance on how to implement early warning systems nor does it provide single sample indicator based threshold levels above which an early warning system should start warning the population bathing water quality is assessed only in the long term by estimating parametric 90th and 95th percentiles based on the surveillance data of the previous four years cf section 2 1 1 the lack of specified thresholds makes it difficult for the responsible authorities to justify and defend short term decisions about closures of or warnings on bathing sites an additional challenge regarding the implementation of early warning systems for managing event scale variability or short term pollution is the quality of available surveillance data bathing water surveillance in europe is only based on periodic at least monthly grab samples accordingly event scale variability is detected only by chance as pollution events may occur between sampling intervals kay et al 2005 even if grab sampling takes place same day a pollution event occurs the sampling time and the occurrence of the pollution event do not necessarily coincide in such cases the grab sample would indicate low fib concentrations which would be correct for that specific location and time if however it is intended to manage the bathing site on a daily basis as e g outlined in stidson et al 2012 the measurement will not contain the correct information regarding the management objective finally even if a grab sample indicates short term pollution no information is given about the duration of the contamination due to the lack of a single sample threshold and the limited information given by periodic single grab samples the prediction of bathing water quality as well as its validation remain a challenge studies which used statistical modelling regardless of using classification or regression approaches often validated the accuracy of the made predictions by using a contingency matrix approach brooks et al 2013 heberger et al 2008 herrig et al 2015 mälzer et al 2016 motamarri and boccelli 2012 stidson et al 2012 brady 2007 this approach determines specificity and sensitivity by the rate of false positives fp false negatives fn true positives tp and true negatives tn if however the validation data cannot be trusted to contain the correct information regarding the management objective e g daily bathing water quality a high false positive rate may be either the result of an overly conservative model or simply the result of random sampling error against this background the objectives of the present study are a to derive a decision criterion for early warning as well as to develop model validation criteria in view of the probabilistic character of european bathing water legislation and uncertain data b to develop statistical models which allow for day to day bathing water management based on official surveillance data fulfilling the derived criteria c to use event based sampling to check whether models are able to predict the duration of contamination in time scales relevant for daily bathing water management d to compare the proposed management approach to the current way of long term classification both in terms of microbial safety and methodological aspects 2 material and methods in order to be accepted by european authorities and beach managers alert levels for early warning should be related as closely as possible to the thresholds outlined in the european bwd therefore we first elaborate a general methodological approach for using the current numerical standards of the bwd as alert levels for early warning systems as well as for validating the quality of model predictions in a second step we apply the derived methodology at a river bathing site known to be recurrently affected by short term pollution finally we compare the suggested approach to the current way of long term classification in terms of microbial safety since e coli dominates bathing water classification in berlin meaning that elevated concentrations of intestinal enterococci without simultaneous increases of e coli are rare the study focuses on the prediction of e coli concentrations however the suggested method can be readily applied to other fib 2 1 methodological approach for deriving alert levels and model validation criteria 2 1 1 current approach of long term classification as set in the eu bwd the european bwd defines numerical standards only for long term bathing water classification to this end a probabilistic approach based on parametric 90th and 95th percentiles is applied the approach assumes that the measured data are log10 normally distributed and derives these percentiles by a log10 transformation of the measured data b calculation of arithmetic mean and standard deviation c calculation of the parametric 90th and 95th percentiles by 1 95th percentile μs 1 65 σs 2 90th percentile μs 1 282 σs and d back transformation from the log10 to the linear scale μs and σs stand for the sample mean and the sample standard deviation of a normal distribution n μs σs 2 bathing waters are classified once a year in view of the upcoming bathing season for this purpose the surveillance data of the four previous bathing seasons are used with a minimum of 16 samples in total table 1 summarizes the different quality classes ranging from excellent to poor 2 1 2 using bwd quality standards as alert levels for early warning in order to use the numerical quality standards of the bwd for early warning systems we need to a define appropriate alert levels and b increase the timely resolution from once per year to time scales relevant for bathing water management 2 1 2 1 defining appropriate alert levels regarding appropriate alert levels we are especially interested in the quality class poor since it is the quality we want the population to be warned of according to the bwd bathing water quality is classified as poor when the point estimate of the 90th percentile based on a minimum of 16 samples collected over four years and assuming a lognormal statistical model indicates that the probability of measuring values larger than 900 mpn 100 ml exceeds 10 consequently if we want to use these standards for early warning we have to predict a probability based on a lognormal model a way of estimating the probability of exceeding which accounts for the lognormality condition is to fit a linear regression model on the log10 transformed data and to use the predicted mean and residual standard deviation to construct a lognormal probability density function pdf in the usa heberger et al 2008 used such an approach to first calibrate the probability of exceeding of the single sample swimming standard of massachusettes of 61 enterococci cfu 100 ml the calibrated probability was used subsequently as a decision criterion above which the model would indicate impaired water quality in a european setting we argue that bathing water quality standards are already defined as probabilities of exceeding so there is actually no need to calibrate these values as they are already given by the bwd namely 10 for sufficient poor quality and 5 for good excellent quality thus we propose to estimate the probability of exceeding based on statistical regression modelling on the log10 transformed fib data and use these estimates as decision criteria against the percentile thresholds as outlined in the bwd in the present study we applied a bayesian approach for regression modelling therein the constructed pdf is referred to as the posterior predictive distribution ppd and the 95 prediction interval as the 95 credible interval ci of the ppd in general the equivalent prediction interval could be computed using a frequentist approach 2 1 2 2 increasing the timely resolution in scotland information systems are in place which inform the public about potentially impaired water quality on a daily basis stidson et al 2012 following this approach we use correlations between fib and readily available data cf section 2 2 4 to update our estimates of the probability of exceeding on a daily basis 2 1 3 validating predicted probabilities by percentage coverage a challenge regarding the prediction of probabilities is that they cannot be validated by comparing predicted classes to single measurements using e g a contingency matrix approach as an illustration if a regression model predicts a probability of exceedance of 20 the classification would be poor however if the prediction were correct we would expect 80 of the validation data to fall below the threshold and 20 to fall above it thus a single measurement gives no information about the correctness of the prediction moreover official surveillance data deliver only one data point per day so we cannot validate the true distribution for each day using only daily grab samples for this reason we focus on evaluating overall model consistency by looking at all validation data points at once if the model is able to capture reality from a probabilistic perspective 95 of the validation data should fall within the 95 credible intervals ci of the ppd 95 should fall below the 95th percentiles and 90 should fall below the 90th percentiles so e g from one hundred validation data points collected on one hundred days the constructed one hundred 95 cis of the ppds should cover 95 as these criteria are in turn subject to sample size based uncertainty we define a one sided cut off criterion based on a beta distribution to exclude all models for which the probability that the true coverage rate is 95 and 90 respectively is less than 5 a beta 1 1 is used as a uniform prior distribution we underline that fulfilling these criteria is no proof that the ppd predicted for each day is correct it is rather an additional minimum requirement which checks for overall model consistency with the test validation data 2 1 4 differences between suggested regression based approach and the approach for long term classification although both the current way of long term classification and the suggested regression based approach estimate the probability of exceeding based on a lognormal model there are some conceptual differences first the current way of calculating upper percentiles according to the bwd does not account for parameter uncertainty regarding μ and σ2 from a human health perspective we prefer including parameter uncertainty which leads to a more conservative estimate of the upper percentiles secondly current long term bathing water classification is based on the data from only four years in order to increase the chances that the training data include data influenced by short term pollution as well as to reduce parameter uncertainty we include all available surveillance data thirdly according to the classification methods as outlined in the bwd all variance in the empirical data is described by the variance parameter σ2 s of the lognormal pdf in regression the variance in the training data is partly explained by the linear model expressed as r2 thus the residual standard deviation decreases with an increase in r2 this relation will become important for model selection and validation cf section 3 3 2 2 application of the described methodology to a river bathing site in berlin germany 2 2 1 bathing site the bathing site kleine badewiese is situated on the river havel downstream of the city center of berlin germany the bathing site is an official european bathing water and is regularly monitored for fib during the bathing season may 15 to september 15 in berlin the usual sampling interval is 14 days from 2012 to 2015 bathing water quality was classified as poor while in 2016 and 2017 it was classified as good and excellent respectively due to water quality problems from 2012 to 2015 the responsible health authorities increased sampling frequencies to weekly samplings during 2016 and 2017 2 2 2 catchment description the sewer system in berlin consists of a separate sewer system in the outer parts of the city and a combined system in the city center fig 1 there are approximately 170 combined sewer overflow cso outlets in berlin heavy rainfall can therefore lead to discharges from csos and cso impacted river water which eventually reaches the bathing location in berlin flow velocities are usually very low depending on the flow q in the river travel times from the city center to the bathing site may range between 32 h and 14 days schumacher and storz 2016 in addition to the cso outlets the largest of berlin s six wastewater treatment plants wwtp is located upstream of the bathing location in dry weather the wwtp treats approximately 250000 m3 d in order to protect bathing water quality during dry periods the majority of the secondary effluent of the wwtp is not discharged into the rivers spree and havel but is pumped south and discharged into a bypassing canal the proportion of secondary effluent which is not pumped south is treated by an additional uv disinfection therefore only disinfected wastewater is discharged into the adjacent river in dry weather during rainy weather however water volumes are too high to be treated completely by the disinfection unit or to be pumped southwards consequently non disinfected secondary effluent is discharged into the river with a maximum flow of approximately 3 m3 s water impacted by these discharges will eventually reach the bathing site 2 2 3 data availability of fib and event based monitoring official surveillance data based on periodic grab samples from 2010 to 2017 n 114 were provided by the berlin health authorities lageso grab samples are measured using most probable number methods iso 9308 3 with a 2 fold dilution and a lower detection limit lod of 15 mpn 100 ml since biweekly grab samples only detect short term pollution by chance and do not give any information about the duration of a contamination refrigerated automated samplers hydreka sigma as 950 see supplementary material were installed for event based sampling during the bathing seasons 2016 and 2017 the main purpose of event based sampling was to identify periods of major fecal pollution from cso and wwtp discharges relevant for daily bathing water management samples were taken during the five days following rain events since impacts from urban wastewater were expected samples were diluted 4 fold in order to ensure that the upper detection limit would suffice samplers contained 24 1l pe bottles hach ps241000 each bottle was filled within 1 h taking 200 ml every 12 min samplers were cooled at 4 c samples were taken about 5 m from the riverbank at a depth of approximately 1 2 m prior to the actual sampling tubes were rinsed three times to avoid carry over for the transport to the laboratory bottles were stored in cooling boxes with cold packs samples were unified to 12 h composite samples the sampling bottles were washed in a laboratory washing machine at 55 c with de ionized water for 60 min and dried in a drying cabinet at 50 c the latter was considered acceptable against the monitoring objective of detecting periods of high fecal pollution from municipal wastewater due to logistic reasons laboratory working hours samples had to be collected around noon thus given that the initiating rain event occurred in the afternoon the first 24 h sampling period was stopped at noon of the following day this way the first sampling period was shortened starting times of the individual composite samples are presented in the supplementary material samples were analyzed for fib the afternoon samples were collected using mpn methods iso 9308 3 therefore the first aliquots of the first 12 h composite sample of the 24 h sampling period may have exceeded the recommended time period for analysis of 24 h by up to 4 h and might be under represented since the intention was to sample different rain weather conditions no specific threshold level for the minimum precipitation was defined due to the low flow velocities in berlin and the short driving distances to the bathing site automated samplers could be started manually by implementing event based sampling as an additional sampling protocol two distinct data sets are available the first one consists of official surveillance data based on grab samples from 2010 to 2017 n 114 with a lower detection limit lod of 15 mpn 100 ml iso 9308 3 the second one consists of 12 h composite samples collected during 2016 2017 with a lod of 40 mpn 100 ml n 118 as the data sets are distinct regarding the information they contain the two types of data were used differently for model checking and validation cf section 2 2 9 1 and section 2 2 9 2 2 2 4 variable selection for regression modelling for the implementation of an early warning system for event scale variability due to heavy rainfall explanatory variables for regression modelling were selected considering the following criteria a explanatory variables should be measured in high timely resolution b data should be readily available to minimize efforts for implementation and c there should be a plausible explanation for the effect of the explanatory variable on fecal contamination at the bathing site following these criteria precipitation p river flow q and the volume of the non disinfected discharge of the wwtp wwtp were selected as key explanatory variables the berlin water utilities bwb wwtp p and the berlin senate department for the environment transport and climate protection senuvk q provided the necessary data a more detailed justification for choosing these variables is provided in the supplementary material 2 2 5 variable construction and transformations due to changing travel times of cso discharges to the bathing site water quality at the bathing site might be impaired concurrently by both rain events that occurred just recently and rain events that happened several days ago the arrival time of the contamination depends on the river flow q in order to account for these kinds of variations different explanatory variables were constructed from wwtp discharges as well as from flow data q daily sums wwtp and averages q were calculated up to five days prior to sampling for each individual day q1 q2 q5 and wwtp1 wwtp2 wwtp5 moreover variables were constructed which summed averaged over multiple days prior to sampling e g q1 3 wwtp 1 3 represent the average sum over three days prior to sampling a similar approach has already been successfully applied by cyterski et al 2012 and herrig et al 2015 rainfall variables were created analogously with two exceptions first spatial averages over all 15 rain gauges were calculated before averaging over time secondly the created rainfall variables were log transformed a value of 1 was added before log transformation the rationale for log transformation is that while discharges of cso and stormwater may increase fib concentrations by orders of magnitude in the first instance a further increase in rainfall and consequently discharge volume will not increase the concentration further linearly on a log10 scale by log transformation the effect of higher rainfall levels is weakened the sampling day was not included in the averaging since in the case of historical data precipitation might have started after sampling creating artefacts of wet weather conditions when the sample might actually have been taken during dry weather conditions due to the lognormality assumption given by the bwd cf section 2 1 1 e coli data were log10 transformed values at the lower and upper detection limit were kept at these values 2 2 6 model formulations the constructed explanatory variables were used to construct nine different models table 2 gives an overview of the constructed models and explanatory variables using the notation outlined in section 2 2 5 models 1 4 focus on different times scales prior to sampling regarding wwtp and p models 5 7 include the wwtp with two individual days prior to sampling and differ regarding the rain variables model 8 uses only q and rainfall data p model 9 was created by stepwise forward selection allowing for pairwise interactions of explanatory variables and limiting the maximum number of explanatory variables to five interactions due to the low flow conditions and long travel times many discharges located upstream of the bathing site are only relevant if flow conditions are high enough to allow the fecal contamination to reach the bathing site within a certain time this dependency is considered by including interaction effects between p and q as well as between wwtp and q in statistical modelling interaction effects are included as the product of two or more predictors see table 2 thereby the effect of q depends on p and vice versa 2 2 7 model fitting all models were fitted using hamiltonian monte carlo hmc for markov chain monte carlo mcmc using the programming languages r r development core team 2008 and stan standevelopmentteam 2017b accounting for full parameter uncertainty in r the package for applied bayesian regression modelling rstanarm and the package function stan lm standevelopmentteam 2017a was used priors were based on the r2 statistic r2 0 8 2 2 8 data separation for model fitting and validation for model fitting and determination of regression parameters θ the historical data grab samples from regular bathing water surveillance from 2010 to 2015 n 74 were used for model validation both the collected event based samples n 118 and the surveillance data of the regular surveillance monitoring of the years 2016 and 2017 n 40 were used cf section 2 2 9 1 and section 2 2 9 2 the two validation years were very distinct the year 2016 was dryer than average with 89 of the annual average precipitation and low flow conditions in june july and august in contrast 2017 was one of the rainiest years ever recorded with precipitation of more than 200 of the annual average for the same months including a 120 year rain event therefore models could be validated against a broad range of different conditions 2 2 9 model checking and comparison normality and homoscedasticity of residuals were tested using the shapiro wilk test and the breusch pagan test respectively r2 was used to analyze how much of the variance in the training data is explained by each statistical model however since the proposed decision criteria for early warning are based on the upper percentiles of the ppd we are less interested in r2 but rather in whether the model is able to capture the variance in the test data thus the criteria outlined in section 2 1 3 were applied to each bathing season as well as to all grab samples 2 2 9 1 percentage coverage for the application of the percentage coverage criterion only the official surveillance data grab samples were used to ensure that the data for fitting and validating the model have the same quality for the individual years of 2016 and 2017 as well as for both years combined the minimum number of data points required to fall within the test intervals for validation of the 95 credible interval and the 95th percentile are 19 21 17 19 and 36 40 90 for validation of the 90th percentile the criteria are 17 21 16 19 and 34 40 86 validation data are considered inside the prediction interval if the best estimate of the mpn analysis falls within the predicted interval 2 2 9 2 graphical model checking the concentrations measured within the collected composite samples represent the arithmetic mean am of the fib concentrations during the sampling period model predictions are based on the log10 transformed data and consequently predict the geometric mean gm of fib concentrations in comparison to the gm the am is easier dragged to higher concentrations in case a pollution event occurs during the sampling period therefore the am can be considered a more conservative estimate of the average concentration during the sampling period than the gm reicherts and emerson 2010 for the assessment of model quality we used the composite samples for graphical model checking since composite samples give information about the duration of contamination at a 12 h resolution we used these samples to check whether the models are able to cover that 12 h trend see supplementary material 2 2 9 3 use of information criteria the approximate leave one out cross validation information criterion loo ic was used as an additional indication for the predictive performance of each model vehtari et al 2017 all calculations were conducted using the loo package in combination with the function loo vehtari et al 2016 the loo ic was calculated for both the training set as well as after refitting the models with all grab samples lower loo ic value indicate better predictive performance 2 3 comparison to long term classification with regard to health protection in order to analyze the health implications of the suggested management approach it was applied retrospectively to the years 2016 and 2017 for each day from may 15 to september 15 the 90th and 95th percentiles of the ppd were simulated using the posterior predict function standevelopmentteam 2017a and compared to the percentile thresholds as outlined in the bwd cf table 1 thereby bathing water quality was classified for each day using the hydraulic information from the days before the results were compared to official bathing water classifications complemented with official warnings communicated by the local health authority the latter are communicated via press release and are mainly experience based ad hoc decisions 3 results 3 1 checking for lognormality and basic models assumptions the individual test results for normality and homoscedasticity for each model are given in the supplementary material two models 6 and 7 out of nine models failed the normality test the residuals showed no heteroscedasticity a comparison of the normality assumption before and after regression modelling is shown in fig 2 results show that while both raw data and lognormally transformed data are not normally distributed regression modelling now leads to normally distributed residuals the latter justifies the use of a lognormal parametric approach for estimating the 90th and 95th percentiles fig 2 3 2 checking for percentage coverage the results of model checking against the percentage coverage criteria are shown in fig 3 fig 4 shows an illustrative example of the best performing model model 3 models which violated the normality assumption are not shown anymore from the remaining seven models only three model 3 model 4 and model 8 passed the applied criteria the 95th percentile test interval indicates to be the strictest criterion among the applied test intervals fig 5 shows the relation between the variance explained r2 and the different percentage coverage criteria for both validation years the model covering the highest proportion of validation data model 3 has the second lowest r2 whereas the model with the highest r2 model 5 value performs the worst this behavior shows that optimizing models only in terms of r2 may lead to overfitting and thereby yields to poor predictive accuracy applying the percentage coverage criterion instead reduces overfitting by ensuring that the model s residual standard deviation remains sufficiently high to reflect the variation in the test data fig 4 also shows that the standard deviation of the predicted distributions has to be very high sd 0 6 to cover this variation the ppd covers approximately 2 2 5 orders of magnitude 3 3 graphical model checking and information criteria times series plots of the seven models which passed the normality test are given in the supplementary material in order to visualize the temporal trends the confidence intervals of the geometric mean are connected by linear interpolation the graphical comparison to the 12 h composite samples indicates that the three models which passed the percentage coverage criterion are able to predict periods of severe fecal pollution however models 3 and 4 cover both composite samples and grab samples better than model 8 due to the lower loo ic value supplementary material of model 3 in comparison to model 4 model 3 is preferred 3 4 comparison to long term classification with regard to health protection fig 6 shows the comparison between long term classification based on data from the previous four years official classification and daily classifications based on model 3 the latter is based on the information and evidence contained in the training data from 2010 to 2015 fig 7 shows the related time series plots monitoring data grab and composite samples and periods of ad hoc precautionary warnings due to the low concentrations measured between 2013 and 2016 in 2017 bathing water quality was classified as excellent by long term classification however due to the rainy weather in 2017 the results from composite sampling after heavy rainfall reveal severe fecal contamination with measured e coli concentrations of up to 105 mpn 100 ml it is worth to mention that even weekly grab samples did not capture this contamination the results prove that long term classification only based on the surveillance data from the previous four years and not considering any other environmental conditions may lead to substantial misjudgments of the actual bathing water quality and may pose a hazard to human health in contrast by updating percentile estimates on a daily basis bathing water quality classifications would alternately indicate periods of better and poor quality predictions of poor comply with elevated concentrations measured in composite samples which represent 12 h averages the model generally shows high consistency regarding the results from both sample types however at three occasions marked with white arrows in fig 7 the model would have predicted sufficient water quality or better while the results from composite samples indicate concentrations above the percentile threshold of 900 mpn 100 ml at two of the three occasions 1 and 3 heavy rainfall 90 mm 12 8 mm on the sampling day itself could be identified as the cause for these high values however including rainfall on the sampling day as an additional explanatory variable in the regression model did not improve predictions for these days thus the information was missing in the training data with regard to observation 2 only minor rainfall occurred on the sampling day 2 mm however the approach presented demonstrates that health protection is improved substantially in comparison to the current way of ad hoc warning and especially in comparison to long term classification 4 discussion 4 1 comparison of proposed alert values to similar studies previous studies which focused on implementing early warning systems for bathing water management in europe used the 90th percentile threshold for sufficient quality either as threshold for classification models stidson et al 2012 for marine waters or compared the maximum likelihood estimate mle of regression models to this threshold herrig et al 2015 bedri et al 2016 mälzer et al 2016 used an even higher concentration of 1800 mpn 100 ml as a classification threshold each of these approaches tolerates that the bulk of the probability mass of the measured data is located very close or even above the percentile threshold when using the mle as applied by herrig et al 2015 the probability of exceeding is tolerated to be up to 50 when using the approach proposed by mälzer et al 2016 up to 100 of the data points are tolerated to fall between 900 mpn and 1800 mpn without warning if 900 mpn is used as a classification threshold 100 of the data should fall below the threshold on the other hand since the lognormal condition is not considered measured data would be allowed to be located very close to the threshold in contrast if the lognormality condition is considered the bulk of the probability mass has to be located much lower as to our case to determine sufficient water quality the evidence in the training data has to indicate that 50 of the data falls below 152 mpn 100 ml 80 below 488 mpn 100 ml only 10 between 500 and 900 mpn 100 ml and an additional 10 is tolerated above 900 mpn 100 ml thus the approach proposed is much stricter regarding the expected frequency of data between 500 and 900 mpn 100 ml while it will like the bwd tolerate occasional outliers fig 8 illustrates the tolerable ranges and frequencies the different approaches allow the data to fall in without warning 4 2 model validation by percentage coverage the introduced model validation criteria based on percentage coverage provide a suitable way to apply probabilistic model checking when only periodic surveillance data are available moreover it prevents overfitting and ensures that the residual standard deviation remains wide enough when models are intended to be used for prediction the latter is particularly important for low sample sizes the criterion has to be considered as an additional minimum requirement for checking model consistency against the test data and not as a proof that the predicted distribution represents the true variability during each individual day to validate the latter many grab samples in high timely resolution would be necessary however heavy rainfall the major source of temporal variation us epa 2010 and accordingly of health concern shows rather stochastic patterns therefore grab samples collected periodically over long time periods are likely to capture event scale variations in the end overall the approach showed very promising results at a large riverine bathing water site in berlin and should therefore be tested and verified at other locations and for other types of bathing waters 4 3 sources of uncertainty assessment approaches which are based on statistical inference i e which make decisions upon estimates of unobservable quantities like parametric 90th or 95th percentiles are always conditional on a the chosen statistical model b the quality and quantity of available data this accounts for both the currently used method for long term classification as well as for the proposed method for regression modelling 4 3 1 uncertainties resulting from random sampling error all statistical inference is conditional on the observed data in particular the estimation of high percentiles is subject to statistical error due to low sample sizes berthouex and hau 1991 moreover if by random sampling no short term pollution is detected and no other prior information is used to build the model a statistical model might not be able to make correct predictions due to both reasons inferences might be wrong however in comparison to the current bwd which only uses the data from the previous four years the presented approach certainly improves the inferences on bathing water quality since all available data as well as the information about their correlation to relevant predictors are used by updating models regularly as more data becomes available uncertainty will be further reduced over time 4 3 2 uncertainties related to the statistical model the estimation of high parametric percentiles of a log10 normal statistical model is sensitive to the choice of the lower detection limit lod the reason for this sensitivity is that e g the difference between 10 mpn 100 ml and 1 mpn 100 ml i e an absolute difference of 9 mpn 100 ml at the lower end of the scale represents a whole order of magnitude thus it will have a larger effect on the estimate of the geometric standard deviation as e g an absolute difference of 500 mpn between 500 mpn and 1000 mpn difference 0 3 orders of magnitude the bwd does not explicitly define requirements for the lod in the present study we used data from official bathing water surveillance with a lod of 15 mpn this lod follows recommendations according to the reference method outlined in the bwd iso 9308 3 therefore we consider this lod as appropriately low or at least in line with current european legislation however due to the sensitivity of estimates of high percentiles to the lower lod clear standards would be desirable 5 conclusions statistical regression modelling offers a promising solution to translate the existing percentile thresholds for long term classification to daily bathing water management the application of the derived percentage coverage criteria accounts for the probabilistic character of eu bathing legislation and reduces the risk of overfitting and thus overly optimistic prediction accuracy in comparison to optimizing models in terms of r2 event based monitoring provided valuable additional information about periods of major fecal pollution and model checking regarding microbial safety the application of the proposed methodology at a riverine bathing water site in berlin demonstrated the shortcomings of current long term classification as well as the potential for improvement by applying the proposed approach since statistical classification approaches do not account for the lognormality assumption preference should be given to

19432,the biological potential of conventional wastewater treatment plants to remove micropollutants mainly depends on process conditions and the predominant microbial community to explore this dependence and to connect the occurrence of genera with operating conditions five pilot scale reactors with different process conditions were combined into two reactor cascades and fed with the effluent of the primary clarifier of a municipal wwtp all reactors and the wwtp were analyzed for the removal of 33 micropollutants by lc ms ms and the presence of the microbial community using 16s rrna gene sequencing the overall removal of the micropollutants was slightly improved ca 20 by the reactor cascades in comparison to the wwtp while certain compounds such as diatrizoate venlafaxine or diclofenac showed an enhanced removal ca 70 in one or both cascades to explore the diverse bacteria in more detail the general community was divided into a core and a specialized community despite their profoundly different operating parameters especially redox conditions the different treatments share a core community consisted of 143 genera 9 of the overall community furthermore the alpha and beta biodiversity as well as the occurrence of several genera belonging to the specialized microbial community could be linked to the prevalent process conditions of the individual treatments members of the specialized community also correlated with the removal of certain groups of micropollutants hence the comparison of the specialized community with micropollutant removal and operating conditions via correlation analysis is a valuable tool for an extended evaluation of prevalent process conditions based on an extended data set this approach could also be used to identify organisms as indicators for operating conditions which are beneficial for an improved removal of specific micropollutants graphical abstract image 1 keywords activated sludge wastewater microbial community 16s rrna amplicon sequencing micropollutants sequencing batch reactor sbr 1 introduction wastewater treatment plants wwtps are primarily designed to reduce high organic loads as well as nitrogen and phosphorous from wastewater before its discharge into natural waters therefore process design and compartmentalization of the wwtp are exploited to optimize the activity of microbial communities for the oxidation of carbon and ammonia reduction of nitrate and in some plants the accumulation of phosphate nowadays however anthropogenic compounds such as pharmaceuticals and personal care products increasingly enter the water cycle these compounds frequently occur at low concentrations micropollutants mps but bear potential risks to environmental and human health even at the microgram per liter range garcia rodriguez et al 2014 wwtps are an important source for the entry of these organic mps since many of these compounds are quite resistant or can only be partially removed during the biological wastewater treatment falås et al 2016 oulton et al 2010 ternes et al 2004 since diverse microbial communities show a highly versatile metabolic potential they bear the possibility to remove mps via enzymatic degradation processes in this vein an improvement of mp removal based on the optimization of the biological wastewater treatment seems plausible indeed many studies have shown the influence of various process parameters on mp degradation clara et al 2005 tran et al 2014 johnson et al 2014 urase and kikuta 2005 the optimization of removal efficiencies however seems to be rather compound specific krah et al 2015 johnson et al 2015 and thus staged systems incorporating different redox conditions have been proposed to lead to an improved overall mp removal völker et al 2017 falås et al 2016 the targeted optimization of biological treatment processes requires a better understanding of the microbial community including the taxonomic composition metabolic functions and the dependence on distinct process parameters as well as a better comprehension of the microbially mediated degradation of mps the characterization of microbial communities or their functionality is hampered by its immense diversity and the closely related metabolic complexity of the activated sludge communities however recent improvements in high throughput techniques such as metagenomics martin et al 2006 metatranscriptomics helbling et al 2012 vuono et al 2016 16s rrna amplicon based community profiling vanwonterghem et al 2014 meerburg et al 2016 and metaproteomics collado et al 2013 hansen et al 2014 wilmes et al 2008 as well as the constantly increasing sequence databases facilitate the analysis of these complex systems however due to the immense diversity of microbial communities in matrices such as activated sludge it has been suggested to preselect smaller groups of organisms based on defined categories saunders et al 2016 to have a closer look on the connection between the community composition and metabolic functions grime 1998 and gibson et al 1999 suggested to divide the community into satellite intermediate and core species according to the core satellite species hypothesis css hypothesis to differentiate the probable role and importance of these organisms in the ecosystems recently the concept of the core community was inter alia further refined and applied by saunders et al 2016 to find frequently abundant and putatively important organisms in 13 danish wwtps the selection and characterization of core communities is a promising approach for the identification of putatively important activated sludge organisms which should be further studied and to get a better understanding about factors selecting for the different abundant species saunders et al 2016 in contrast it is generally assumed that for many mps the degradation is linked to specific treatment conditions and thus rather specific species of the microbial community falås et al 2018 the identification of significant associations between mp removal and non core species could help to identify indicator specifies for specific treatment conditions which facilitate the removal of certain mps this is also true if these species are not directly involved in the mp degradation but their high relative abundance reflect beneficial conditions for degradation non causal relationship however to date only a few studies tried to connect the degradation of mps with the prevalent microbial community in wwtps johnson et al 2015 analyzed biotransformation rates of ten mps in ten different wwtps and found positive associations between the rates of specific mps and different indices of taxonomic as well as functional biodiversity another strategy was the application of statistical mathematical models to predict relationships between specific bacterial 16s rrna sequence abundances and biotransformation rates helbling et al 2015 the authors identified phylogenetic groups which could predict the measured differences in the rate constants of four out of ten selected mps in this context the aim of this study was to link prevalent microbial communities with predominant process conditions and the mp removal potential of six profoundly differently operated treatments in order to develop a deep understanding of these complex settings the complexity of the microbial community was reduced by dividing it into a specialized and a core community based on defined filter criteria and statistical selection the main research questions were i to what extent the community composition depends on the specific process conditions of five profoundly different biological wastewater treatments five bench scale sequence batch reactors sbrs and a wwtp ii whether a core community exists which is comparable with other studies iii whether the distribution of rather specific species with the highest variability in relative abundance reflect the distinct reactor conditions and iv to what extent these species are positively associated with mp removal and thus could potentially indicate favorable process conditions with regard to mp removal the applied method developed in this work can be used as a tool to systematically prioritize annotated 16s rrna data and investigate their occurrence in relation to predominant process conditions and mp removal in future 2 material and methods 2 1 examined treatment conditions and sampling of biomass a full scale wastewater treatment plant wwtp and a bench scale pilot plant were investigated during the course of this study both were described in detail by völker et al 2016 briefly the wwtp located in koblenz germany is treating an inflow of 61 000 m³ per day with a load of 220 000 population equivalents

nitrification and denitrification sludge retention time srt of about 12 d and a final clarification step the pilot plant consisted of five sequential batch reactors sbrs 12 l volume separated into two reactor cascades each fed with the effluent of the primary clarifier of the wwtp koblenz reactor cascade ι started with a conventional activated sludge treatment r1 oxic and anoxic phases for nitrification or denitrification respectively serving as reference reactor followed by a second reactor running under anoxic to anaerobic conditions r2 equipped with acetate dosage for complete denitrification and finally a third reactor r3 which was running strictly anaerobic no availability of both oxygen and nitrate fig 1 left cascade ιι started with an anaerobic reactor r4 with iron iii dosage for iron reducing conditions followed by an aerated reactor r5 oxic and anoxic phases and a simplified vessel v with acetate addition for complete denitrification fig 1 right the latter was installed to prevent nitrate output since half of the effluent was recirculated to the anaerobic reactor r4 biomass in form of sludge was sampled four times in triplicate during a course of 5 weeks

analytics department of the hzi helmholtz centre for infection research braunschweig germany using an illumina miseq in paired end mode 2 250 bp 2 4 data processing after sequencing the 16s rrna gene amplicons the data quality was checked using solexaqa software cox et al 2010 next the paired end reads were binned with the pear software zhang et al 2014 and demultiplexed the software usearch based on the uclust algorithm edgar 2010 was used to bin the merged reads with a sequence similarity of 97 to operational taxonomic units otus subsequently the representative sequences of each otu from the cluster output were classified by the ribosomal database project rdp database release 11 update 3 cole et al 2014 with the standard confidence threshold of 80 using its classifier tool wang et al 2007 the following analyses were performed with the calculated relative abundances for each sample based on the classifier output at genus level the principal component analysis pca was performed by the r package factoextra kassambara and mundt 2016 the calculations of the alpha diversity index shannon h were performed with the software past hammer et al 2001 to identify and sort the genera which provide the main contribution to the community differences between the different treatments a similarity percentage analysis simper was performed with the software past hammer et al 2001 all genera below a defined threshold 70 of the cumulative contribution were declared as specialized genera chapter 3 3 the remaining 30 served as input and filter criteria i for the identification of the core community chapter 3 2 visualization of the simper output fig s 2 2 5 micropollutant analysis to detect the removal of certain mps the influents and effluents of the two reactor cascades reactor r3 and r5d and the full scale wwtp as well as the effluent of the reference reactor r1 were sampled over 9 weeks in this period three one week composite samples were taken from the wwtp and eight one week composite samples from the reactor effluents samples were filtered mn gf 5 0 4 μm macherey nagel and stored at 20 c until chemical analysis a spectrum of 33 mps including pharmaceuticals human metabolites and biocides were analyzed by liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry lc ms ms according to the method previously described by falås et al 2016 percentage removal of each compound was calculated according to equation 1 by correcting the effluent concentration via the respective dilution factor df and comparison to the influent concentration removal values less than the 25th percentile q1 minus 1 5 times the interquartile range iqr or higher than the 75th percentile q3 plus 1 5 times the iqr tukey fences were considered as outliers and excluded from further calculations to determine mps with a significant removal in minimum one of the treatments in comparison to the others a kruskal wallis test with a p adjustment correction bonferroni was performed in r to identify mp elimination which correlates significantly with genera from the specialized community a pearson product moment correlation and the p value adjustment benjamini hochberg were also calculated in r the individual relative abundances of the specialized community and the removal values of mps showing a significant removal in accordance to the performed kruskal wallis test served as input data 1 removal 1 c effluent df c influent 100 3 results and discussion 3 1 general description and characterization of the system communities on average approximately 43 700 quality filtered reads were measured per sample accumulating to 1625 genus level phylotypes in total for all analyzed treatments principal component analysis pca was used to visualize the microbial communities of all samples with regard to the similarity between the different reactors as well as the change of community composition over time fig 2 the pca plot illustrates that the time separated replicates of each individual reactor cluster closely represented by 95 confidence ellipses indicating a good methodological reproducibility and additionally a stable microbial community composition throughout the sampling period of 35 days since the samples of all aerobic treatments are located in the upper half of the pca while all anaerobic treatments are in the lower half a major factor contributing to the distribution along the y axis dimension 2 25 7 of variation might be the redox conditions the strong influence of oxygen availability on the community composition is further confirmed by the respiratory abilities of the top 20 genera contributing to the variation in community composition fig 2 blue arrows comparatively high relative abundances of aerobic or microaerophilic genera such as curvibacter ding and yokota 2004 fulvimonas ahn et al 2014 or aquabacterium lin et al 2009 are responsible for the location of r1 and wwtp on the pca plot while obligate anaerobic organisms like desulfuromonas an and picardal 2015b smithella liu et al 1999 or desulfonatronobacter sorokin et al 2012 strongly contribute to the location of the iron amended anaerobic reactor r4 another group of genera with mainly facultative anaerobic respiration e g ignavibacterium iino et al 2010 sulfuritalea kojima and fukui 2011 or sulfurisoma kojima and fukui 2014 determines the position of the anoxic and anaerobic reactors r2 r3 of reactor cascade ι the distances of samples on the pca plot indicate that the community composition shift from the aerated r1 to the unaerated r2 r3 reactors of cascade ι is notably stronger than the shift between the anaerobic r4 and aerobic r5 reactors of cascade ιι one factor for this is likely the recirculation within reactor cascade ιι where after each cycle half of the effluent of the whole cascade was retransferred to the first reactor r4 furthermore samples of the two reactor cascades are separated along the x axis dimension 1 34 1 of variation which indicates overall differences between the two reactor cascades at the taxonomic level on the right side of the pca the overlap of the clusters from r1 and wwtp except three samples with a different composition in comparison to the remaining samples as well as the overlap of ellipses of r2 and r3 indicate that treatments with analogous process conditions developed largely similar microbial communities it also confirmed r1 to be a suitable reference reactor representing conventional activated sludge treatment of full scale wwtp in contrast the samples of the aerobic reactor r5 cluster on the left side of the pca indicating a differing microbial community composition featuring a high contribution of the genus luteimonas reasons for that could be a lower doc load 11 mg l and a higher hrt 2 7 d in reactor r5 than in the other aerobic treatments r1 and wwtp 30 mg l doc 12 h hrt furthermore the position of the cluster from the unaerated reactor r4 on the left side of the pca apart from the overlapping clusters of the two other anaerobic reactors r2 and r3 on the right indicates a distinct community composition in r4 despite similar redox conditions reasons for the differing community composition could be i the iron addition ii the high substrate load due to its position as anaerobic pre treatment in contrast to the post treatments r2 and r3 and iii the multiple changes of the redox conditions caused by the recirculation biodiversity is essential to enable and facilitate particular ecosystem functions and thus biodiversity indices are considered important variables to describe microbial communities hernandez raquet et al 2013 in contrast to the species richness the shannon index h takes the number of species as well as their relative abundances into account and was calculated for every sample on the genus level in total the results showed values between 3 7 and 5 4 fig 3 which are comparable to values commonly reported for wastewater microbial communities in literature gonzalez martinez et al 2016 wang et al 2016 in comparison the reactors of cascade ι displayed increasing values from the first r1 to the last reactor r3 where the anaerobic post treatment reactor r3 showed the highest h value of all treatments 5 4 comparable differences in biodiversity were also observed when using species richness instead of shannon index fig s 3 johnson et al 2014 investigated ten activated sludge communities and observed that the taxonomic richness of the aerobic communities was negatively associated with the nitrogen and carbon availability even though acetate was dosed to r2 the doc in the influents of the three reactors of reactor cascade ι sequentially decreased from 35 4 mg l in the influent of r1 to 21 5 mg l incl acetate in the influent of r2 and 8 4 mg l in the influent of r3 it can be assumed that especially the amount of bioavailable carbon was considerably reduced by the sequential treatment in this reactor cascade similarly the sum of nh4 n and no3 n was reduced from 40 9 mg l in the influent of r1 to 11 4 mg l in the influent of r2 and 2 mg l in the influent of r3 hence our results support the findings of johnson et al 2014 and indicate that biodiversity in anaerobic wastewater reactors might be to some extent also connected to carbon and nitrogen availability in contrast the diversity in r5 of reactor cascade ιι was significantly lower compared to all other reactors even though the very low doc in the effluent of r5 5 8 mg l indicated rather carbon limiting conditions in this reactor this however could be explained by the very high relative abundance of the genus luteimonas average of 21 3 in r5 calculation of the shannon indices without this genus fig s 4 was comparable average 4 3 and no longer significantly different group c to r4 and r1 3 2 core community in the present study the concept of the core community was applied to investigate whether a core community can also be identified in profoundly differently operated treatments and whether identified core species were similar to those found by saunders et al 2016 for this investigation genera fulfilling three hierarchically applied criteria were assigned to the core i a stable occurrence with no high fluctuations between all treatments genera which represented 30 contribution to the similarity based on the simper analysis ii presence in all samples of all treatments iii a minimum of 0 05 relative abundance in at least one of the aerobic r1 r5 wwtp and one of the anaerobic r2 r3 r4 treatments by applying these criteria 143 of 1625 genera were assigned to the core community fig 4 and consisted exclusively of bacteria more than half of the core genera belonged to the phylum proteobacteria 54 where the β subdivision was the most dominant class followed by γ δ and α proteobacteria other dominant phyla of the core community were bacteroidetes 12 firmicutes 8 and verrucomicrobia 5 the composition of the identified core community particularly on the taxonomic phylum and class level was comparable with other investigated wwtps zhang et al 2012 the most abundant four phyla and their composition on order level were depicted in more detail in the bar charts of fig 4 a comparison of these taxa to the 63 core organisms described by saunders et al 2016 on order level resulted in an overlap of 43 groups 77 a comparison on genus level would be more specific due to the higher level of metabolic differentiation in contrast to the taxonomic order or family level respectively however a more detailed comparison with organisms from saunders et al 2016 was hampered because in their study only 20 out of the 63 core organisms were annotated on genus level five out of these 20 genera were also part of the core community defined in the current study wang et al 2012 also defined a set of 60 genera as core organisms but by using only one criterion genera shared by all samples these examples illustrate two main requirements for the meaningful comparison of results from such datasets qualitatively good data with high sequence coverage to be able to annotate sequences on a low taxonomic level depending on reference 16s rrna database and a consistent definition of the term core community applying comparable filter criteria the adherence to these requirements would provide the opportunity to identify a core microbial community across different treatments even from different studies prospectively this knowledge could aid the management of basic ecosystem functions and help to tackle process disturbances e g in activated sludge systems 3 3 specialized community to identify those genera which predominantly contribute to the community differences between the reactors operated under distinct nutrient and redox conditions the specialized community was defined based on the simper analysis only 5 5 of the overall community of all samples i e 90 of 1625 genera with the highest variability in relative abundance were responsible for 70 of the dissimilarity between the communities in the different treatments see fig s 2 in general the metabolic abilities of these 90 genera belonging to the specialized community fig 5 reflected the operating conditions of the individual treatments with regard to the relative abundance 11 genera of the specialized community showed a strong similarity in the wwtp and reference reactor r1 such as zoogloea dechloromonas curvibacter and thauera most of these genera are denitrifying organisms which are typically found in conventional wwtps hagman et al 2008 yang et al 2011 this is in accordance with the fact that the highest nitrate turnover took place in the wwtp and the reference reactor r1 in comparison to the other treatments however r1 also contained some exclusive genera such as hydrogenophaga arenimonas or fulvimonas these three genera are strict aerobes of which the last two genera belong to the order xanthomonadales hydrogenophaga is a special microorganism belonging to the group of hydrogen oxidizing bacteria willems et al 1989 which includes species known for 4 aminobenzenesulfonate degradation contzen et al 2000 in accordance with the prevalent redox conditions the proportion of anaerobic or microaerophilic genera strongly differed between the aerated treatments r1 r5 and wwtp ca 10 5 and the unaerated reactors r2 r3 and r4 ca 81 a high similarity was observed between r2 and r3 with a comparable number of highly abundant genera especially chemoautotrophic sulfur oxidizing bacteria like sulfuricurvum sulfuritalea sulfurimonas sulfurisoma arcobacter thiobacillus or thiotrix species from the last four genera have also been attributed as mixotrophic organisms cattaneo et al 2003 roalkvam et al 2015 pokorna and zabranska 2015 complementing the sulfur cycle sulphate reducing bacteria were present in reactors r2 and r3 e g desulfatirhabdium desulfatiglans or desulfosarcina but in lower relative abundance than the sulfur oxidizing organisms this is in accordance with the detection of sulfide 3 7 mg l in reactors r2 and r3 the presence of sulfur oxidizing bacteria or the relatively abundant genera geobacter ignavibacterium or azospira indicated favorable growth conditions for autotrophic bacteria which might be explained by the limited bioavailable carbon cuevas et al 2011 and the anoxic respectively anaerobic conditions especially geobacter species have been reported to play important roles in the microbial diversity of anaerobic environments with regard to their ability to use a wide range of electron acceptors as well as donors and to the anaerobic oxidation of aromatic compounds lovley et al 2011 similar to the anoxic anaerobic reactors r2 and r3 the anaerobic iron reducing reactor r4 also contained highly abundant sulfur oxidizing e g arcobacter and sulfur reducing bacteria e g desulfonatronobacter however the predominant genera were different and occurred in minor number of different taxa as in the other two anaerobic reactors since the ability to oxidize sulfur is pronounced in many bacterial genera different mechanisms of sulfur oxidation friedrich 1997 have evolved beside the different availability of oxygen or oxidized forms of nitrogen other contributing factors like the molar n s ratio or the used form of reduced sulfur can affect the final products of the sulfur oxidation pokorna and zabranska 2015 the different process conditions in particular with regard to the change of these factors in the anaerobic reactors of cascade ι r2 r3 in comparison to cascade ιι r4 could be an explanation for the occurrence of different genera with the ability to perform the oxidation of sulfur the most dominant genus in r4 was desulfuromonas which includes species that are able to reduce sulfur as well as fe iii bilyy et al 2011 an and picardal 2015a this corresponds to the fact that fecl3 was added to this reactor during the sampling period furthermore the relatively high relative abundance of the strictly anaerobic propionate oxidizing genus smithella de bok et al 2001 in reactor r4 is in accordance with the presence of the genera propionigenium paludibacter and desulfobulbus which have been reported to ferment organic compounds under anaerobic conditions thereby producing propionate hydrogen and acetate holmes et al 2004 ueki et al 2006 janssen and liesack 1995 the presence of genera assigned to fermenting bacteria and the small occurrence of autotrophic bacteria in the anaerobic reactor r4 of cascade ιι in contrast to their lower relative abundance in the anaerobic post treatments r2 and r3 of reactor cascade ι could be explained by its position as a pre treatment and therefor a much higher supply load availability of easily degradable compounds whereas these were most likely consumed in reactor r1 before the anaerobic treatments in cascade ι methanogenic prokaryotes were expected in the anaerobic reactors r2 r3 and r4 but could not be detected in either the core or in the specialized community however 15 methanogenic genera fig s 6 were found in the remaining data with the highest summed relative abundance found in the anaerobic reactors r3 0 20 r2 0 015 and r4 0 014 in comparison to the other treatments in average 0 002 possible reasons for the low relative abundance of methanogenic archaea could be suboptimal growth conditions low temperature in combination with special requirements of these organisms high substrate specificity slow growth rate another plausible reason for the low relative abundance of methanogens could be the known competition with sulfate reducing organisms for available substances such as hydrogen or acetate oremland and polcin 1982 in combination with more favorable growth conditions for desulfuricating bacteria the composition of the specialized community of r5 was considerably different with regard to the reference reactor r1 and the activated sludge unit of the wwtp even though all three treatments were operated under comparable redox conditions using alternating aeration for nitrification and denitrification the differences could be attributed to the iron reducing pre treatment in reactor r4 which leads to a considerably lower doc in the influent of r5 6 mg l compared to the influent of the reference reactor r1 11 mg l and the full scale activated sludge unit of the wwtp 11 mg l especially certain denitrifying genera like luteimonas novosphingobium or diaphorobacter had considerably higher relative abundances in r5 compared to r1 and the activated sludge of the wwtp in particular the most abundant genus luteimonas seemed to be an interesting organism since one species was found to perform an uncommon denitrification reaction where nitrite but not nitrate is incompletely reduced to the end product nitrous oxide finkmann et al 2000 moreover the addition of iron and the anaerobic conditions in r4 led to a transfer of reduced sulfur species and fe ii to r5 which explains the relatively high relative abundances of sulfur oxidizers like thiobacillus or arcobacter and the iron oxidizing genus gallionella de vet et al 2011 3 4 micropollutant removal and correlation with specialized community for all 33 analyzed mps the removal difference between r1 and the full scale wwtp was not significant p 0 05 wilcoxon mann whitney test which confirms the suitability of the operating conditions for r1 as a reference for the wwtp averaged over all measured compounds a significant improvement p 0 05 kruskal wallis test of ca 20 of the overall removal in both reactor cascades could be observed in comparison to the reference reactor r1 fig s 5 which was comparable to the values reported in völker et al 2017 to select significantly removed substances p 0 05 fig 6 the average removals of each compound in the wwtp the reference reactor r1 the reactors from reactor cascade ι r2 r3 and cascade ιι r4 r5 were compared to each other kruskal wallis test with bonferroni correction this led to a selection of 22 mps in order to identify genera which are rather specific for the different conditions and also positively associated with an improved degradation of certain compounds the removal of the selected 22 mps in the different reactors was correlated pearson product moment correlation followed by p value adjustment with the corresponding relative abundance of genera belonging to the specialized community the results were visualized in a heat map fig 7 relative instead of absolute abundances were used because the method of 16s rrna gene amplicon sequencing does not allow for an accurate measurement of absolute abundances this is due to a weak dependency of the total number of sequences generated per sample and the amount of template dna suzuki and giovannoni 1996 even though relative abundances might not accurately reflect the observed dynamics of the actual taxon densities it was the best available proxy to establish a connection between community structure and mp removal from the 22 selected mps 12 compounds showed an increased removal by at least 30 in either r2 r3 3 substances or r4 r5 9 substances compared to the reference reactor r1 and the wwtp for example diatrizoate venlafaxine and tramadol were significantly removed in both reactor cascades while no removal was observed in the wwtp and the reference reactor r1 fig 6 the removal of these compounds in both reactor cascades could be explained by the increased potential for reductive reactions provided by the anaerobic reactors r2 r3 and r4 such as deiodination in case of diatrizoate redeker et al 2014 and anaerobic demethylation in case of venlafaxine and tramadol falås et al 2016 the suspected reductive transformations were confirmed by the analysis of the appropriate transformation products data not shown due to their similar degradation behavior in both reactor cascades these compounds also cluster in the heat map cluster 1 fig 7 although the removal of all three compounds was higher in reactor cascade ι than in reactor cascade ιι consistent with the higher removal in the anaerobic reactors of cascade ι r2 r3 diatrizoate venlafaxine and tramadol showed a significant positive correlation with those microorganisms of the specialized community which are mainly anaerobic or microaerophilic and rather specific for these reactors such as desulfatirhabdium ignavibacterium and desulfatiglans however to what extent these microorganisms are generally indicative of favorable conditions for the enhanced removal of the analyzed substances needs to be further assessed in follow up studies for other compounds such as metoprolol 10 11 dihydro 10 hydrocarbamazepine dhh cbz 10 11 dihydro 10 11 dihydroxycarbamazepine dh dh cbz and diclofenac a considerably higher removal was identified in the reactor cascade ιι r4 r5 compared to the other treatments fig 6 therefore these compounds were grouped in another cluster cluster 2 fig 7 which correlated with the predominant taxa of reactor cascade ιι since removal efficiencies of the individual reactors of cascade ιι could not be determined it was impossible to differentiate between the removal efficiencies of the anaerobic pre treatment r4 and the aerobic reactor r5 due to the missing individual removal efficiencies of r4 and r5 the taxonomic data of both reactors also needed to be merged for the correlation analysis however literature suggests that metoprolol dhh cbz dh dh cbz and diclofenac are primarily degraded under aerobic conditions jewell et al 2016 kaiser et al 2014 rubirola et al 2014 which indicates that r5 was mainly responsible for the higher degradation potential of cascade ιι towards these compounds hence those genera of cluster ii which are rather specific for the aerobic reactor r5 e g luteimonas roseibaca or phenylobacterium and thus might be potential indicators for favorable degradation conditions of the aerobically degradable compounds of cluster 2 e g metoprolol dhh cbz and diclofenac were highlighted in fig 7 for a better differentiation the significant negative correlation with the anaerobic or microaerophilic microorganisms in the anaerobic reactors r2 and r3 further supported that most of the compounds of cluster 2 were mainly degraded under aerobic conditions exceptions were the antibiotics erythromycin and sulfamethoxazole which also have been reported to be degraded under anaerobic conditions falås et al 2016 narumiya et al 2013 indeed both compounds were removed by activated sludge treatment in the wwtp and in the reference reactor r1 as well as to a relatively high extent in the anaerobic reactors of cascade ι r2 r3 which suggests that their removal in cascade ιι was not restricted to the aerobic reactor r5 considering the rather low doc in the effluent of r5 due to the pretreatment by the iron reducing reactor r4 carbon limiting conditions might be one driving factor for the enhanced degradation of metoprolol dhh cbz dh dh cbz and diclofenac in r5 compounds of a third cluster 3 acesulfame iopromide bezafibrate iomeprol and terbutryn are characterized by a comparable removal in the wwtp and the reference reactor r1 as well as only a slight but consistently higher removal in reactor cascade ιι fig 7 as these compounds are known to be preferentially degraded under aerobic conditions castronovo et al 2017 radke and maier 2014 rühmland et al 2015 luft et al 2014 their removal in cascade ιι could be attributed to degradation in the aerobic reactor r5 moreover these compounds were if at all removed only to a minor extent 30 in the reactors r2 and r3 of cascade ι where anaerobic conditions were prevalent fig 6 consistently these compounds show a significant positive correlation with those genera e g gemmatimonas sphingorhabdus or terrimonas which had similar relative abundances in the references wwtp and r1 and reactor r5 as well as significant negative correlations with the microaerophilic and anaerobic organisms prevalent in r2 and r3 the correlation analysis was used as an approach to select for those microorganisms which might be indicators of favorable environmental conditions for the degradation of certain mps and should not be misinterpreted as an indication of any causal relationship however to confirm whether specific microorganisms can indeed serve as general predictors for certain operating conditions as well as the removal of certain mps in different biological wastewater treatment systems more studies providing data sets combining microbial community composition with the corresponding removal of a broad set of different mps need to be evaluated moreover the results could be further supported by quantitative measurements of absolute abundances by measuring 16s copies via qpcr or performing spike in experiments as already described stämmler et al 2016 tourlousse et al 2017 however this was out of the scope of this study 4 conclusions profoundly differently operated reactors appear to share a core community 9 of all bacterial genera the elucidation of the general microbial community as well as the specialized microbial community compositions in the individual treatments demonstrated that large parts of the communities adapt to different operating conditions this was corroborated by the occurrence of several genera linked to the adjusted process conditions while the overall mp removal was only slightly improved by the investigated reactor cascades combining aerobic and strictly anaerobic treatments the removal of individual compounds such as diatrizoate venlafaxine or diclofenac was significantly increased relative abundances of members of the specialized community within each reactor significantly correlated with the removal of certain groups of mps this bears the potential to establish organisms as indicators for operating conditions which are beneficial for an improved removal of these compounds redox conditions and carbon supply were important drivers for both the composition of the specialized community and the removal of mps in the two examined reactor cascades the correlation of the specialized microbial community to mp removal and especially operating conditions presents 16s rrna gene amplicon sequencing as a complementary tool for the confirmation of established process conditions acknowledgments this work was supported by the european research council erc via the athene project grant agreement 267897 we

19432,the biological potential of conventional wastewater treatment plants to remove micropollutants mainly depends on process conditions and the predominant microbial community to explore this dependence and to connect the occurrence of genera with operating conditions five pilot scale reactors with different process conditions were combined into two reactor cascades and fed with the effluent of the primary clarifier of a municipal wwtp all reactors and the wwtp were analyzed for the removal of 33 micropollutants by lc ms ms and the presence of the microbial community using 16s rrna gene sequencing the overall removal of the micropollutants was slightly improved ca 20 by the reactor cascades in comparison to the wwtp while certain compounds such as diatrizoate venlafaxine or diclofenac showed an enhanced removal ca 70 in one or both cascades to explore the diverse bacteria in more detail the general community was divided into a core and a specialized community despite their profoundly different operating parameters especially redox conditions the different treatments share a core community consisted of 143 genera 9 of the overall community furthermore the alpha and beta biodiversity as well as the occurrence of several genera belonging to the specialized microbial community could be linked to the prevalent process conditions of the individual treatments members of the specialized community also correlated with the removal of certain groups of micropollutants hence the comparison of the specialized community with micropollutant removal and operating conditions via correlation analysis is a valuable tool for an extended evaluation of prevalent process conditions based on an extended data set this approach could also be used to identify organisms as indicators for operating conditions which are beneficial for an improved removal of specific micropollutants graphical abstract image 1 keywords activated sludge wastewater microbial community 16s rrna amplicon sequencing micropollutants sequencing batch reactor sbr 1 introduction wastewater treatment plants wwtps are primarily designed to reduce high organic loads as well as nitrogen and phosphorous from wastewater before its discharge into natural waters therefore process design and compartmentalization of the wwtp are exploited to optimize the activity of microbial communities for the oxidation of carbon and ammonia reduction of nitrate and in some plants the accumulation of phosphate nowadays however anthropogenic compounds such as pharmaceuticals and personal care products increasingly enter the water cycle these compounds frequently occur at low concentrations micropollutants mps but bear potential risks to environmental and human health even at the microgram per liter range garcia rodriguez et al 2014 wwtps are an important source for the entry of these organic mps since many of these compounds are quite resistant or can only be partially removed during the biological wastewater treatment falås et al 2016 oulton et al 2010 ternes et al 2004 since diverse microbial communities show a highly versatile metabolic potential they bear the possibility to remove mps via enzymatic degradation processes in this vein an improvement of mp removal based on the optimization of the biological wastewater treatment seems plausible indeed many studies have shown the influence of various process parameters on mp degradation clara et al 2005 tran et al 2014 johnson et al 2014 urase and kikuta 2005 the optimization of removal efficiencies however seems to be rather compound specific krah et al 2015 johnson et al 2015 and thus staged systems incorporating different redox conditions have been proposed to lead to an improved overall mp removal völker et al 2017 falås et al 2016 the targeted optimization of biological treatment processes requires a better understanding of the microbial community including the taxonomic composition metabolic functions and the dependence on distinct process parameters as well as a better comprehension of the microbially mediated degradation of mps the characterization of microbial communities or their functionality is hampered by its immense diversity and the closely related metabolic complexity of the activated sludge communities however recent improvements in high throughput techniques such as metagenomics martin et al 2006 metatranscriptomics helbling et al 2012 vuono et al 2016 16s rrna amplicon based community profiling vanwonterghem et al 2014 meerburg et al 2016 and metaproteomics collado et al 2013 hansen et al 2014 wilmes et al 2008 as well as the constantly increasing sequence databases facilitate the analysis of these complex systems however due to the immense diversity of microbial communities in matrices such as activated sludge it has been suggested to preselect smaller groups of organisms based on defined categories saunders et al 2016 to have a closer look on the connection between the community composition and metabolic functions grime 1998 and gibson et al 1999 suggested to divide the community into satellite intermediate and core species according to the core satellite species hypothesis css hypothesis to differentiate the probable role and importance of these organisms in the ecosystems recently the concept of the core community was inter alia further refined and applied by saunders et al 2016 to find frequently abundant and putatively important organisms in 13 danish wwtps the selection and characterization of core communities is a promising approach for the identification of putatively important activated sludge organisms which should be further studied and to get a better understanding about factors selecting for the different abundant species saunders et al 2016 in contrast it is generally assumed that for many mps the degradation is linked to specific treatment conditions and thus rather specific species of the microbial community falås et al 2018 the identification of significant associations between mp removal and non core species could help to identify indicator specifies for specific treatment conditions which facilitate the removal of certain mps this is also true if these species are not directly involved in the mp degradation but their high relative abundance reflect beneficial conditions for degradation non causal relationship however to date only a few studies tried to connect the degradation of mps with the prevalent microbial community in wwtps johnson et al 2015 analyzed biotransformation rates of ten mps in ten different wwtps and found positive associations between the rates of specific mps and different indices of taxonomic as well as functional biodiversity another strategy was the application of statistical mathematical models to predict relationships between specific bacterial 16s rrna sequence abundances and biotransformation rates helbling et al 2015 the authors identified phylogenetic groups which could predict the measured differences in the rate constants of four out of ten selected mps in this context the aim of this study was to link prevalent microbial communities with predominant process conditions and the mp removal potential of six profoundly differently operated treatments in order to develop a deep understanding of these complex settings the complexity of the microbial community was reduced by dividing it into a specialized and a core community based on defined filter criteria and statistical selection the main research questions were i to what extent the community composition depends on the specific process conditions of five profoundly different biological wastewater treatments five bench scale sequence batch reactors sbrs and a wwtp ii whether a core community exists which is comparable with other studies iii whether the distribution of rather specific species with the highest variability in relative abundance reflect the distinct reactor conditions and iv to what extent these species are positively associated with mp removal and thus could potentially indicate favorable process conditions with regard to mp removal the applied method developed in this work can be used as a tool to systematically prioritize annotated 16s rrna data and investigate their occurrence in relation to predominant process conditions and mp removal in future 2 material and methods 2 1 examined treatment conditions and sampling of biomass a full scale wastewater treatment plant wwtp and a bench scale pilot plant were investigated during the course of this study both were described in detail by völker et al 2016 briefly the wwtp located in koblenz germany is treating an inflow of 61 000 m³ per day with a load of 220 000 population equivalents and a hydraulic retention time hrt of 12 h the wwtp consists of a mechanical treatment screening grit removal and primary clarifier followed by conventional activated sludge treatment with nitrification and denitrification sludge retention time srt of about 12 d and a final clarification step the pilot plant consisted of five sequential batch reactors sbrs 12 l volume separated into two reactor cascades each fed with the effluent of the primary clarifier of the wwtp koblenz reactor cascade ι started with a conventional activated sludge treatment r1 oxic and anoxic phases for nitrification or denitrification respectively serving as reference reactor followed by a second reactor running under anoxic to anaerobic conditions r2 equipped with acetate dosage for complete denitrification and finally a third reactor r3 which was running strictly anaerobic no availability of both oxygen and nitrate fig 1 left cascade ιι started with an anaerobic reactor r4 with iron iii dosage for iron reducing conditions followed by an aerated reactor r5 oxic and anoxic phases and a simplified vessel v with acetate addition for complete denitrification fig 1 right the latter was installed to prevent nitrate output since half of the effluent was recirculated to the anaerobic reactor r4 biomass in form of sludge was sampled four times in triplicate during a course of 5 weeks

analytics department of the hzi helmholtz centre for infection research braunschweig germany using an illumina miseq in paired end mode 2 250 bp 2 4 data processing after sequencing the 16s rrna gene amplicons the data quality was checked using solexaqa software cox et al 2010 next the paired end reads were binned with the pear software zhang et al 2014 and demultiplexed the software usearch based on the uclust algorithm edgar 2010 was used to bin the merged reads with a sequence similarity of 97 to operational taxonomic units otus subsequently the representative sequences of each otu from the cluster output were classified by the ribosomal database project rdp database release 11 update 3 cole et al 2014 with the standard confidence threshold of 80 using its classifier tool wang et al 2007 the following analyses were performed with the calculated relative abundances for each sample based on the classifier output at genus level the principal component analysis pca was performed by the r package factoextra kassambara and mundt 2016 the calculations of the alpha diversity index shannon h were performed with the software past hammer et al 2001 to identify and sort the genera which provide the main contribution to the community differences between the different treatments a similarity percentage analysis simper was performed with the software past hammer et al 2001 all genera below a defined threshold 70 of the cumulative contribution were declared as specialized genera chapter 3 3 the remaining 30 served as input and filter criteria i for the identification of the core community chapter 3 2 visualization of the simper output fig s 2 2 5 micropollutant analysis to detect the removal of certain mps the influents and effluents of the two reactor cascades reactor r3 and r5d and the full scale wwtp as well as the effluent of the reference reactor r1 were sampled over 9 weeks in this period three one week composite samples were taken from the wwtp and eight one week composite samples from the reactor effluents samples were filtered mn gf 5 0 4 μm macherey nagel and stored at 20 c until chemical analysis a spectrum of 33 mps including pharmaceuticals human metabolites and biocides were analyzed by liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry lc ms ms according to the method previously described by falås et al 2016 percentage removal of each compound was calculated according to equation 1 by correcting the effluent concentration via the respective dilution factor df and comparison to the influent concentration removal values less than the 25th percentile q1 minus 1 5 times the interquartile range iqr or higher than the 75th percentile q3 plus 1 5 times the iqr tukey fences were considered as outliers and excluded from further calculations to determine mps with a significant removal in minimum one of the treatments in comparison to the others a kruskal wallis test with a p adjustment correction bonferroni was performed in r to identify mp elimination which correlates significantly with genera from the specialized community a pearson product moment correlation and the p value adjustment benjamini hochberg were also calculated in r the individual relative abundances of the specialized community and the removal values of mps showing a significant removal in accordance to the performed kruskal wallis test served as input data 1 removal 1 c effluent df c influent 100 3 results and discussion 3 1 general description and characterization of the system communities on average approximately 43 700 quality filtered reads were measured per sample accumulating to 1625 genus level phylotypes in total for all analyzed treatments principal component analysis pca was used to visualize the microbial communities of all samples with regard to the similarity between the different reactors as well as the change of community composition over time fig 2 the pca plot illustrates that the time separated replicates of each individual reactor cluster closely represented by 95 confidence ellipses indicating a good methodological reproducibility and additionally a stable microbial community composition throughout the sampling period of 35 days since the samples of all aerobic treatments are located in the upper half of the pca while all anaerobic treatments are in the lower half a major factor contributing to the distribution along the y axis dimension 2 25 7 of variation might be the redox conditions the strong influence of oxygen availability on the community composition is further confirmed by the respiratory abilities of the top 20 genera contributing to the variation in community composition fig 2 blue arrows comparatively high relative abundances of aerobic or microaerophilic genera such as curvibacter ding and yokota 2004 fulvimonas ahn et al 2014 or aquabacterium lin et al 2009 are responsible for the location of r1 and wwtp on the pca plot while obligate anaerobic organisms like desulfuromonas an and picardal 2015b smithella liu et al 1999 or desulfonatronobacter sorokin et al 2012 strongly contribute to the location of the iron amended anaerobic reactor r4 another group of genera with mainly facultative anaerobic respiration e g ignavibacterium iino et al 2010 sulfuritalea kojima and fukui 2011 or sulfurisoma kojima and fukui 2014 determines the position of the anoxic and anaerobic reactors r2 r3 of reactor cascade ι the distances of samples on the pca plot indicate that the community composition shift from the aerated r1 to the unaerated r2 r3 reactors of cascade ι is notably stronger than the shift between the anaerobic r4 and aerobic r5 reactors of cascade ιι one factor for this is likely the recirculation within reactor cascade ιι where after each cycle half of the effluent of the whole cascade was retransferred to the first reactor r4 furthermore samples of the two reactor cascades are separated along the x axis dimension 1 34 1 of variation which indicates overall differences between the two reactor cascades at the taxonomic level on the right side of the pca the overlap of the clusters from r1 and wwtp except three samples with a different composition in comparison to the remaining samples as well as the overlap of ellipses of r2 and r3 indicate that treatments with analogous process conditions developed largely similar microbial communities it also confirmed r1 to be a suitable reference reactor representing conventional activated sludge treatment of full scale wwtp in contrast the samples of the aerobic reactor r5 cluster on the left side of the pca indicating a differing microbial community composition featuring a high contribution of the genus luteimonas reasons for that could be a lower doc load 11 mg l and a higher hrt 2 7 d in reactor r5 than in the other aerobic treatments r1 and wwtp 30 mg l doc 12 h hrt furthermore the position of the cluster from the unaerated reactor r4 on the left side of the pca apart from the overlapping clusters of the two other anaerobic reactors r2 and r3 on the right indicates a distinct community composition in r4 despite similar redox conditions reasons for the differing community composition could be i the iron addition ii the high substrate load due to its position as anaerobic pre treatment in contrast to the post treatments r2 and r3 and iii the multiple changes of the redox conditions caused by the recirculation biodiversity is essential to enable and facilitate particular ecosystem functions and thus biodiversity indices are considered important variables to describe microbial communities hernandez raquet et al 2013 in contrast to the species richness the shannon index h takes the number of species as well as their relative abundances into account and was calculated for every sample on the genus level in total the results showed values between 3 7 and 5 4 fig 3 which are comparable to values commonly reported for wastewater microbial communities in literature gonzalez martinez et al 2016 wang et al 2016 in comparison the reactors of cascade ι displayed increasing values from the first r1 to the last reactor r3 where the anaerobic post treatment reactor r3 showed the highest h value of all treatments 5 4 comparable differences in biodiversity were also observed when using species richness instead of shannon index fig s 3 johnson et al 2014 investigated ten activated sludge communities and observed that the taxonomic richness of the aerobic communities was negatively associated with the nitrogen and carbon availability even though acetate was dosed to r2 the doc in the influents of the three reactors of reactor cascade ι sequentially decreased from 35 4 mg l in the influent of r1 to 21 5 mg l incl acetate in the influent of r2 and 8 4 mg l in the influent of r3 it can be assumed that especially the amount of bioavailable carbon was considerably reduced by the sequential treatment in this reactor cascade similarly the sum of nh4 n and no3 n was reduced from 40 9 mg l in the influent of r1 to 11 4 mg l in the influent of r2 and 2 mg l in the influent of r3 hence our results support the findings of johnson et al 2014 and indicate that biodiversity in anaerobic wastewater reactors might be to some extent also connected to carbon and nitrogen availability in contrast the diversity in r5 of reactor cascade ιι was significantly lower compared to all other reactors even though the very low doc in the effluent of r5 5 8 mg l indicated rather carbon limiting conditions in this reactor this however could be explained by the very high relative abundance of the genus luteimonas average of 21 3 in r5 calculation of the shannon indices without this genus fig s 4 was comparable average 4 3 and no longer significantly different group c to r4 and r1 3 2 core community in the present study the concept of the core community was applied to investigate whether a core community can also be identified in profoundly differently operated treatments and whether identified core species were similar to those found by saunders et al 2016 for this investigation genera fulfilling three hierarchically applied criteria were assigned to the core i a stable occurrence with no high fluctuations between all treatments genera which represented 30 contribution to the similarity based on the simper analysis ii presence in all samples of all treatments iii a minimum of 0 05 relative abundance in at least one of the aerobic r1 r5 wwtp and one of the anaerobic r2 r3 r4 treatments by applying these criteria 143 of 1625 genera were assigned to the core community fig 4 and consisted exclusively of bacteria more than half of the core genera belonged to the phylum proteobacteria 54 where the β subdivision was the most dominant class followed by γ δ and α proteobacteria other dominant phyla of the core community were bacteroidetes 12 firmicutes 8 and verrucomicrobia 5 the composition of the identified core community particularly on the taxonomic phylum and class level was comparable with other investigated wwtps zhang et al 2012 the most abundant four phyla and their composition on order level were depicted in more detail in the bar charts of fig 4 a comparison of these taxa to the 63 core organisms described by saunders et al 2016 on order level resulted in an overlap of 43 groups 77 a comparison on genus level would be more specific due to the higher level of metabolic differentiation in contrast to the taxonomic order or family level respectively however a more detailed comparison with organisms from saunders et al 2016 was hampered because in their study only 20 out of the 63 core organisms were annotated on genus level five out of these 20 genera were also part of the core community defined in the current study wang et al 2012 also defined a set of 60 genera as core organisms but by using only one criterion genera shared by all samples these examples illustrate two main requirements for the meaningful comparison of results from such datasets qualitatively good data with high sequence coverage to be able to annotate sequences on a low taxonomic level depending on reference 16s rrna database and a consistent definition of the term core community applying comparable filter criteria the adherence to these requirements would provide the opportunity to identify a core microbial community across different treatments even from different studies prospectively this knowledge could aid the management of basic ecosystem functions and help to tackle process disturbances e g in activated sludge systems 3 3 specialized community to identify those genera which predominantly contribute to the community differences between the reactors operated under distinct nutrient and redox conditions the specialized community was defined based on the simper analysis only 5 5 of the overall community of all samples i e 90 of 1625 genera with the highest variability in relative abundance were responsible for 70 of the dissimilarity between the communities in the different treatments see fig s 2 in general the metabolic abilities of these 90 genera belonging to the specialized community fig 5 reflected the operating conditions of the individual treatments with regard to the relative abundance 11 genera of the specialized community showed a strong similarity in the wwtp and reference reactor r1 such as zoogloea dechloromonas curvibacter and thauera most of these genera are denitrifying organisms which are typically found in conventional wwtps hagman et al 2008 yang et al 2011 this is in accordance with the fact that the highest nitrate turnover took place in the wwtp and the reference reactor r1 in comparison to the other treatments however r1 also contained some exclusive genera such as hydrogenophaga arenimonas or fulvimonas these three genera are strict aerobes of which the last two genera belong to the order xanthomonadales hydrogenophaga is a special microorganism belonging to the group of hydrogen oxidizing bacteria willems et al 1989 which includes species known for 4 aminobenzenesulfonate degradation contzen et al 2000 in accordance with the prevalent redox conditions the proportion of anaerobic or microaerophilic genera strongly differed between the aerated treatments r1 r5 and wwtp ca 10 5 and the unaerated reactors r2 r3 and r4 ca 81 a high similarity was observed between r2 and r3 with a comparable number of highly abundant genera especially chemoautotrophic sulfur oxidizing bacteria like sulfuricurvum sulfuritalea sulfurimonas sulfurisoma arcobacter thiobacillus or thiotrix species from the last four genera have also been attributed as mixotrophic organisms cattaneo et al 2003 roalkvam et al 2015 pokorna and zabranska 2015 complementing the sulfur cycle sulphate reducing bacteria were present in reactors r2 and r3 e g desulfatirhabdium desulfatiglans or desulfosarcina but in lower relative abundance than the sulfur oxidizing organisms this is in accordance with the detection of sulfide 3 7 mg l in reactors r2 and r3 the presence of sulfur oxidizing bacteria or the relatively abundant genera geobacter ignavibacterium or azospira indicated favorable growth conditions for autotrophic bacteria which might be explained by the limited bioavailable carbon cuevas et al 2011 and the anoxic respectively anaerobic conditions especially geobacter species have been reported to play important roles in the microbial diversity of anaerobic environments with regard to their ability to use a wide range of electron acceptors as well as donors and to the anaerobic oxidation of aromatic compounds lovley et al 2011 similar to the anoxic anaerobic reactors r2 and r3 the anaerobic iron reducing reactor r4 also contained highly abundant sulfur oxidizing e g arcobacter and sulfur reducing bacteria e g desulfonatronobacter however the predominant genera were different and occurred in minor number of different taxa as in the other two anaerobic reactors since the ability to oxidize sulfur is pronounced in many bacterial genera different mechanisms of sulfur oxidation friedrich 1997 have evolved beside the different availability of oxygen or oxidized forms of nitrogen other contributing factors like the molar n s ratio or the used form of reduced sulfur can affect the final products of the sulfur oxidation pokorna and zabranska 2015 the different process conditions in particular with regard to the change of these factors in the anaerobic reactors of cascade ι r2 r3 in comparison to cascade ιι r4 could be an explanation for the occurrence of different genera with the ability to perform the oxidation of sulfur the most dominant genus in r4 was desulfuromonas which includes species that are able to reduce sulfur as well as fe iii bilyy et al 2011 an and picardal 2015a this corresponds to the fact that fecl3 was added to this reactor during the sampling period furthermore the relatively high relative abundance of the strictly anaerobic propionate oxidizing genus smithella de bok et al 2001 in reactor r4 is in accordance with the presence of the genera propionigenium paludibacter and desulfobulbus which have been reported to ferment organic compounds under anaerobic conditions thereby producing propionate hydrogen and acetate holmes et al 2004 ueki et al 2006 janssen and liesack 1995 the presence of genera assigned to fermenting bacteria and the small occurrence of autotrophic bacteria in the anaerobic reactor r4 of cascade ιι in contrast to their lower relative abundance in the anaerobic post treatments r2 and r3 of reactor cascade ι could be explained by its position as a pre treatment and therefor a much higher supply load availability of easily degradable compounds whereas these were most likely consumed in reactor r1 before the anaerobic treatments in cascade ι methanogenic prokaryotes were expected in the anaerobic reactors r2 r3 and r4 but could not be detected in either the core or in the specialized community however 15 methanogenic genera fig s 6 were found in the remaining data with the highest summed relative abundance found in the anaerobic reactors r3 0 20 r2 0 015 and r4 0 014 in comparison to the other treatments in average 0 002 possible reasons for the low relative abundance of methanogenic archaea could be suboptimal growth conditions low temperature in combination with special requirements of these organisms high substrate specificity slow growth rate another plausible reason for the low relative abundance of methanogens could be the known competition with sulfate reducing organisms for available substances such as hydrogen or acetate oremland and polcin 1982 in combination with more favorable growth conditions for desulfuricating bacteria the composition of the specialized community of r5 was considerably different with regard to the reference reactor r1 and the activated sludge unit of the wwtp even though all three treatments were operated under comparable redox conditions using alternating aeration for nitrification and denitrification the differences could be attributed to the iron reducing pre treatment in reactor r4 which leads to a considerably lower doc in the influent of r5 6 mg l compared to the influent of the reference reactor r1 11 mg l and the full scale activated sludge unit of the wwtp 11 mg l especially certain denitrifying genera like luteimonas novosphingobium or diaphorobacter had considerably higher relative abundances in r5 compared to r1 and the activated sludge of the wwtp in particular the most abundant genus luteimonas seemed to be an interesting organism since one species was found to perform an uncommon denitrification reaction where nitrite but not nitrate is incompletely reduced to the end product nitrous oxide finkmann et al 2000 moreover the addition of iron and the anaerobic conditions in r4 led to a transfer of reduced sulfur species and fe ii to r5 which explains the relatively high relative abundances of sulfur oxidizers like thiobacillus or arcobacter and the iron oxidizing genus gallionella de vet et al 2011 3 4 micropollutant removal and correlation with specialized community for all 33 analyzed mps the removal difference between r1 and the full scale wwtp was not significant p 0 05 wilcoxon mann whitney test which confirms the suitability of the operating conditions for r1 as a reference for the wwtp averaged over all measured compounds a significant improvement p 0 05 kruskal wallis test of ca 20 of the overall removal in both reactor cascades could be observed in comparison to the reference reactor r1 fig s 5 which was comparable to the values reported in völker et al 2017 to select significantly removed substances p 0 05 fig 6 the average removals of each compound in the wwtp the reference reactor r1 the reactors from reactor cascade ι r2 r3 and cascade ιι r4 r5 were compared to each other kruskal wallis test with bonferroni correction this led to a selection of 22 mps in order to identify genera which are rather specific for the different conditions and also positively associated with an improved degradation of certain compounds the removal of the selected 22 mps in the different reactors was correlated pearson product moment correlation followed by p value adjustment with the corresponding relative abundance of genera belonging to the specialized community the results were visualized in a heat map fig 7 relative instead of absolute abundances were used because the method of 16s rrna gene amplicon sequencing does not allow for an accurate measurement of absolute abundances this is due to a weak dependency of the total number of sequences generated per sample and the amount of template dna suzuki and giovannoni 1996 even though relative abundances might not accurately reflect the observed dynamics of the actual taxon densities it was the best available proxy to establish a connection between community structure and mp removal from the 22 selected mps 12 compounds showed an increased removal by at least 30 in either r2 r3 3 substances or r4 r5 9 substances compared to the reference reactor r1 and the wwtp for example diatrizoate venlafaxine and tramadol were significantly removed in both reactor cascades while no removal was observed in the wwtp and the reference reactor r1 fig 6 the removal of these compounds in both reactor cascades could be explained by the increased potential for reductive reactions provided by the anaerobic reactors r2 r3 and r4 such as deiodination in case of diatrizoate redeker et al 2014 and anaerobic demethylation in case of venlafaxine and tramadol falås et al 2016 the suspected reductive transformations were confirmed by the analysis of the appropriate transformation products data not shown due to their similar degradation behavior in both reactor cascades these compounds also cluster in the heat map cluster 1 fig 7 although the removal of all three compounds was higher in reactor cascade ι than in reactor cascade ιι consistent with the higher removal in the anaerobic reactors of cascade ι r2 r3 diatrizoate venlafaxine and tramadol showed a significant positive correlation with those microorganisms of the specialized community which are mainly anaerobic or microaerophilic and rather specific for these reactors such as desulfatirhabdium ignavibacterium and desulfatiglans however to what extent these microorganisms are generally indicative of favorable conditions for the enhanced removal of the analyzed substances needs to be further assessed in follow up studies for other compounds such as metoprolol 10 11 dihydro 10 hydrocarbamazepine dhh cbz 10 11 dihydro 10 11 dihydroxycarbamazepine dh dh cbz and diclofenac a considerably higher removal was identified in the reactor cascade ιι r4 r5 compared to the other treatments fig 6 therefore these compounds were grouped in another cluster cluster 2 fig 7 which correlated with the predominant taxa of reactor cascade ιι since removal efficiencies of the individual reactors of cascade ιι could not be determined it was impossible to differentiate between the removal efficiencies of the anaerobic pre treatment r4 and the aerobic reactor r5 due to the missing individual removal efficiencies of r4 and r5 the taxonomic data of both reactors also needed to be merged for the correlation analysis however literature suggests that metoprolol dhh cbz dh dh cbz and diclofenac are primarily degraded under aerobic conditions jewell et al 2016 kaiser et al 2014 rubirola et al 2014 which indicates that r5 was mainly responsible for the higher degradation potential of cascade ιι towards these compounds hence those genera of cluster ii which are rather specific for the aerobic reactor r5 e g luteimonas roseibaca or phenylobacterium and thus might be potential indicators for favorable degradation conditions of the aerobically degradable compounds of cluster 2 e g metoprolol dhh cbz and diclofenac were highlighted in fig 7 for a better differentiation the significant negative correlation with the anaerobic or microaerophilic microorganisms in the anaerobic reactors r2 and r3 further supported that most of the compounds of cluster 2 were mainly degraded under aerobic conditions exceptions were the antibiotics erythromycin and sulfamethoxazole which also have been reported to be degraded under anaerobic conditions falås et al 2016 narumiya et al 2013 indeed both compounds were removed by activated sludge treatment in the wwtp and in the reference reactor r1 as well as to a relatively high extent in the anaerobic reactors of cascade ι r2 r3 which suggests that their removal in cascade ιι was not restricted to the aerobic reactor r5 considering the rather low doc in the effluent of r5 due to the pretreatment by the iron reducing reactor r4 carbon limiting conditions might be one driving factor for the enhanced degradation of metoprolol dhh cbz dh dh cbz and diclofenac in r5 compounds of a third cluster 3 acesulfame iopromide bezafibrate iomeprol and terbutryn are characterized by a comparable removal in the wwtp and the reference reactor r1 as well as only a slight but consistently higher removal in reactor cascade ιι fig 7 as these compounds are known to be preferentially degraded under aerobic conditions castronovo et al 2017 radke and maier 2014 rühmland et al 2015 luft et al 2014 their removal in cascade ιι could be attributed to degradation in the aerobic reactor r5 moreover these compounds were if at all removed only to a minor extent 30 in the reactors r2 and r3 of cascade ι where anaerobic conditions were prevalent fig 6 consistently these compounds show a significant positive correlation with those genera e g gemmatimonas sphingorhabdus or terrimonas which had similar relative abundances in the references wwtp and r1 and reactor r5 as well as significant negative correlations with the microaerophilic and anaerobic organisms prevalent in r2 and r3 the correlation analysis was used as an approach to select for those microorganisms which might be indicators of favorable environmental conditions for the degradation of certain mps and should not be misinterpreted as an indication of any causal relationship however to confirm whether specific microorganisms can indeed serve as general predictors for certain operating conditions as well as the removal of certain mps in different biological wastewater treatment systems more studies providing data sets combining microbial community composition with the corresponding removal of a broad set of different mps need to be evaluated moreover the results could be further supported by quantitative measurements of absolute abundances by measuring 16s copies via qpcr or performing spike in experiments as already described stämmler et al 2016 tourlousse et al 2017 however this was out of the scope of this study 4 conclusions profoundly differently operated reactors appear to share a core community 9 of all bacterial genera the elucidation of the general microbial community as well as the specialized microbial community compositions in the individual treatments demonstrated that large parts of the communities adapt to different operating conditions this was corroborated by the occurrence of several genera linked to the adjusted process conditions while the overall mp removal was only slightly improved by the investigated reactor cascades combining aerobic and strictly anaerobic treatments the removal of individual compounds such as diatrizoate venlafaxine or diclofenac was significantly increased relative abundances of members of the specialized community within each reactor significantly correlated with the removal of certain groups of mps this bears the potential to establish organisms as indicators for operating conditions which are beneficial for an improved removal of these compounds redox conditions and carbon supply were important drivers for both the composition of the specialized community and the removal of mps in the two examined reactor cascades the correlation of the specialized microbial community to mp removal and especially operating conditions presents 16s rrna gene amplicon sequencing as a

19433,the effective removal of haloacetamides hams as a group of emerging disinfection by products is essential for drinking water safety this study investigated the degradation of 10 hams including chlorinated brominated and iodinated analogues by sodium sulfite s iv and the mechanism behind it the results indicated that all hams excluding chlorinated hams decomposed immediately when exposed to s iv the reductive dehalogenation kinetics were well described by a second order kinetics model first order in s iv and first order in hams the degradation rates of hams increased with the increase of ph and they were positively correlated with sulfite concentration indicating that the reaction of s iv with hams mainly depends on sulfite the rank order and relative activity of the reaction of sulfite with hams depends on bimolecular nucleophilic substitution reaction reactivity the order of the reductive dehalogenation rates of hams versus the substitution of halogen atoms was iodo bromo chloro during reductive dehalogenation of hams by sulfite the α carbon bound to the amide group underwent nucleophilic attack at 180 to the leaving group halide as a consequence the halide was pushed off the opposite side generating a transition state pentacoordinate the breaking of the c x bond and the formation of the new c s bond occurred simultaneously and ham sulfonate formed as the immediate product results suggest that s iv can be used to degrade brominated and iodinated hams in drinking water and therefore should not be added as a quenching agent before ham analysis to accurately determine the ham concentrations produced during water disinfection graphical abstract image 1 keywords disinfection by products haloacetamides sodium sulfite reductive dehalogenation sulfonate 1 introduction haloacetamides hams which were identified as a group of emerging disinfection by products dbps in finished water for the first time in a 2000 2002 us survey have received considerable attention krasner et al 2006 subsequent studies indicated that hams were widely detected at low μg l levels in disinfected samples final waters and distribution samples bond et al 2011 2015 richardson et al 2007 although the concentrations of hams were lower than those of regulated carbonaceous dbps c dbps including trihalomethanes thms and haloacetic acids haas they were nearly two orders of magnitude more cytotoxic and genotoxic in mammalian cell assays plewa et al 2008 the cytotoxicity and genotoxicity of the hams by halogen substituent types decrease in the following order iodo bromo chloro plewa et al 2008 the study of plewa and wagner even indicated that diiodoacetamide diam and monoiodoacetamide miam are the first and second most cytotoxic of 87 aliphatic dbps based on the fact that mammalian cell density is 50 compared to the control of the assay plewa and wagner 2015 therefore it is important to remove hams particularly brominated and iodinated ones according to their high toxicity richardson et al 2008 although the pre treatments to remove dbp precursors and the modification of disinfection methods can mitigate the formation of dbps chu et al 2015 chuang and mitch 2017 jiang et al 2017 li et al 2017 zhang et al 2017 dbps still presents ubiquitously in municipal drinking waters therefore the third category i e the removal of dbps after their formation is significantly important for drinking water safety especially relatively nontoxic low cost and effective methods for the mitigation of hams esp brominated and iodinated hams and other dbps are urgently needed a recent study investigated the effects of four commonly used quenching agents i e sodium sulfite s iv sodium thiosulfate ascorbic acid and ammonium chloride on the stability of hams results showed that s iv at a low dosage 20 μm and ph of 7 0 led to a quick loss of hams compared to the three other quenching agents ding et al 2018 a previous study also indicated that several aliphatic dbps were all adversely affected by s iv between sample collection at the sampling sites and analysis in the laboratory kristiana et al 2014 it was also reported that trichloroacetonitrile tcan chloropicrin and cyanogen chloride all reacted with s iv to form dehalogenated species i e dichloroacetonitrile dichloronitromethane and cyanogen respectively via dehalogenation reactions croue and reckhow 1989 shang et al 2005 yiin et al 1987 comprehensively explored the degradation of chloramines including monochloramine dichloroamine and trichloroamine in the presence of s iv and results indicated that reduction was proceeded through the transition state formed by nucleophilic attack of sulfite on cl coupled with proton donation to the non bonding electron pair of n by h3o or by a buffer acid batterman et al 2000 also some studies indicated that carbon bound to the halide was subjected to nucleophile attack by sulfite during the reduction of 3 bromopropene 2 bromopropene and 1 bromoxehexane fam and stenstrom 1988 haag and mill 1988 a common oxidation product of s iv is sulfate which is relatively nontoxic xie 2003 summarized the degradation kinetics of a range of chlorinated and brominated dbps however the degradation kinetics and reaction mechanisms of dbps especially for the highly toxic iodinated hams in the presence of s iv are still unknown and require to be further investigated the objectives of this study were to investigate the degradation kinetics of 10 hams including dichloroacetamide dcam bromochloroacetamide bcam dibromoacetamide dbam chloroiodoacetamide ciam bromoiodoacetamide biam diam trichloroacetamide tcam bromodichloroacetamide bdcam dibromochloroacetamide dbcam and tribromoacetamide tbam by s iv and to obtain a fundamental understanding of ham decomposition mechanisms as well as the nature of consequent reaction products in the presence of s iv this study will provide new insight about the selective mitigation of bromianted and iodinated dbps in drinking water by a easy operation and low costs method 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials monochloroacetamide mcam dcam and tcam were obtained from alfa aesar karlsruhe germany monobromoacetamide mbam and miam were obtained from sigma aldrich st louis usa bcam dbam ciam biam diam bdcam dbcam and tbam were all purchased from cansyn chem corp toronto canada

of 10 mm phosphate buffer ph 6 0 50 μl of individual trihalogenated ham tham stocking solution 2 mg ml in methanol was introduced to obtain the desired initial ham concentration i e 100 μg l at the start of each experiment and then the predetermined volumes of s iv was injected into the aqueous samples to obtain the desired initial concentrations 0 2 5 5 7 5 and 10 μm the degradation of 4 thams with 5 μm s iv under ph 5 5 6 0 6 5 and 7 0 10 mm phosphate buffer were performed to investigate the effect of ph on the degradation of thams in addition to compare the effect of halogen substituent types of hams on the degradation rates the degradation of 6 dihalogenated hams dhams i e dcam bcam dbam ciam biam and diam with 5 μm s iv at ph 6 was conducted for each experiment a reference group with only hams without s iv was added to distinguish the ham hydrolysis from the reduction by s iv after predetermined time intervals desired portions of the aqueous solution were withdrawn for dbp concentration analysis a previous study demonstrated that the tcan and chloropicrin underwent decomposition to form corresponding dehalogenated species in the presence of sulfite croue and reckhow 1989 to verify and elucidate the degradation pathway of the reaction of hams with sulfite three dhams and two monohalogenated hams mhams were also targeted during the degradation of hams at ph 6 0 the volatilization of hams and haas is negligible owing to their high boiling points the error bars in all figures represent the relative standard deviation of three analyses 2 3 analytical methods hams were immediately extracted at the end of the predetermined reaction time by adding 2 ml mtbe to a 10 ml aqueous sample which was then shaken for 3 min using a multi tube vortex mixer dmt 2500 shanghai china at 2300 rpm the hams were analysed immediately using a gas chromatograph equipped with an electron capture detector gc ecd shimadzu corporation qp2010plus japan haas were derivatized to their

supplementary materials table s1 and described in a previous study chu et al 2016a chloride and bromide were measured using an ion chromatography dionex ics 1000 usa chu et al 2011 3 results and discussion 3 1 kinetics of ham degradation under different doses of s iv the degradation of 4 thams were conducted individually under ph 6 0 condition with five different s iv doses 0 2 5 5 7 5 and 10 μm the ph of aqueous solutions were buffed at ph 6 0 because the degradation of three brominated thams by s iv at alkali conditions is too fast to determine the degradation kinetic constants during initial experiments as is evident in fig 1 the relationship between ham molar concentration and time was consistent with pseudo first order reaction kinetics for the degradation of hams by s iv the overall reaction can be expressed by eq 1 using kobs as the pseudo first order observed rate constant rearranging and integrating eq 1 produces eq 2 the kobs values for the degradation of hams in the presence of s iv can be calculated from the slope of the fitted line in fig 1 and are shown in table s2 it should be noted that neutral water and hydroxide also result in the hydrolysis of hams chu et al 2009 yu and reckhow 2015 as shown in fig 1a slight tcam degradation was observed in the absence of s iv while the presence of s iv resulted in a rapid loss of the thams therefore hams was predominantly degraded through the reaction of the hams with s iv and the hydrolysis of hams is minor fate mechanism for hams degradation kobs can be expressed by eq 3 in eq 3 kh and ks represent the hydrolysis and s iv reaction rate constants respectively 1 d h a m d t k o b s h a m 2 ln ham ln ham 0 k o b s t 3 k o b s k h k s 4 k o b s k h k a p p s ⅳ fig 1 and table s2 show that the degradation rate of hams increased with the increase of s iv concentration demonstrating that s iv concentration drove ham degradation based on the previous study shang et al 2005 kobs can be expressed via a hierarchical structure which is proposed in eq 4 in which kapp represents the apparent second reaction rate constant of s iv kobs was fitted for the degradation of hams at different s iv concentrations through the application of linear least squares regression and by fixing the intercept at the kobs value in the absence of s iv fig sm1 the hydrolysis rate constants of the hams were determined and were shown in table s3 strong linear regressions between s iv concentration and kobs r2 0 98 indicated that the reaction between the hams and s iv followed second order kinetics it should be noted that the degradation of other dbps by activated carbon or other treatment methods follow the two stage degradation kinetic tung et al 2006 xie 2003 the difference of the degradation kinetics for hams and other dbps was attributed to the different degradation mechanisms fig 1 illustrates that s iv reacted immediately with three brominated hams i e bdcam dbcam and tbam resulting in the quick loss of brominated hams within 2 h under a s iv concentration of 10 μm however the decomposition of tcam was far slower than the brominated analogues and tcam was not eliminated after 120 h of contact under the same conditions the degradation rates for these four thams increased in the following order tcam bdcam dbcam tbam which was consistent with a previous study indicating that compared with chlorinated hams brominated hams were more easily reduced by zero valent iron zvi chu et al 2016b in general the degradation of hams by the substitution of halogen atoms in the presence of s iv decreased in the following order bromo chloro which was attributed to the different bond lengths and decreasing dissociation energies of the halogens croue and reckhow 1989 these phenomena will be discussed in detail in section 3 3 3 2 kinetics of ham degradation at different ph levels the reactivity of s iv depends on its speciation which is ph dependent eqs 5 and 6 croue and reckhow 1989 the α0 and α1 of eq 6 represent the distribution fractions of bisulfite and sulfite at a specific ph to determine the effects of different s iv species i e sulfite and bisulfite on the decomposition of hams the degradation of four thams i e tcam bdcam dbcam and tbam with an initial s iv concentration of 5 μm at ph 5 5 6 0 6 5 and 7 0 conditions was investigated in fig 2 it is too fast to examine the degradation kinetics of three brominted thams at the alkali conditions the degradation of tcam was relatively slow compared to the brominated thams at all ph levels which was consistent with last section at ph 5 5 the three brominated thams were incompletely degraded up to 7 h whereas they were completely degraded at ph 7 0 within 1 h as the same s iv concentration as for the tcam less than half of it was decomposed at ph 5 5 after 120 h similar to that in the last section the relationship between ham molar concentration and time was consistent with pseudo first order reaction kinetics for the degradation of hams at different ph levels and the kobs can be calculated from the slope of the linear least squares regression fitted line in fig 2 eq 2 5 h s o 3 s o 3 2 h k a i 5 6 10 8 m 6 α 0 h h k a i α 1 k a i h k a i 7 d h a m d t k h k h s o 3 h s o 3 t k s o 3 2 s o 3 2 t h a m 8 d h a m d t k h k h s o 3 α 0 s ⅳ k s o 3 2 α 1 s ⅳ h a m 9 ln ham ln ham 0 k h t k

relationship between hams decomposition and the sulfite the calculated apparent second order rate constants kapp for hams decomposition and the distribution of sulfite and bisulfite under different phs are presented in fig 3 with the increase of ph the distribution ratio of sulfite and bisulfite increased that is sulfite percentage increased and the calculated kapp for hams decomposition increased the positive relationship of kapp and sulfite levels indicates that the reaction of hams with s iv might depend on sulfite the ph dependence of the full second order rate constants can be formulated by eqs 7 and 8 to determine the specific reaction rate constants of sulfite and bisulfite rearranging and integrating eq 8 results in eq 9 substituting eq 10 into eq 4 results in eq 11 thereby the apparent second order rate constants kapp for the degradation of hams by considering ham reactivity with each of these two forms of s iv can be expressed as eq 11 then the k h s o 3 and k s o 3 2 values for the degradation of hams can be calculated via the non linear least squares regression and the reaction rate constants are shown in table s5 results showed that the values for k s o 3 2 were nearly two orders of magnitude higher than the k h s o 3 values for the degradation of individual hams a previous study also indicated that the role of bisulfite can be neglected during the degradation of chloropicrin and hans croue and reckhow 1989 this is expected as sulfite is a much stronger nucleophile than bisulfite croue and reckhow 1989 therefore the second order degradation kinetics for hams can be expressed using eq 12 by dropping the bisulfite term resulting in the higher degrees of freedom for kinetic functions the k s o 3 2 values can be calculated from the slope of the fitted line in fig sm2 and are shown in table 1 good linear fit r2 0 98 in fig sm2 further confirmed that sulfite is the only reactive s iv ion for hams degradation 3 3 effect of halogen substituent types of hams on the degradation rates fig 4 presents the reaction of s iv with six dhams including dcam bcam dbam ciam biam and diam at ph 6 0 to investigate the effect of halogen substituent types on the degradation of hams similar to previous sections the pseudo first order observed rate constant kobs values for the degradation of dhams in the presence of s iv can be calculated from the slope of the fitted line in fig 4 and are shown in table s6 the hydrolysis constants for 6 dhams at ph 6 0 were also shown in table s6 the k s o 3 2 values for the degradation of dhams can be calculated using eq 12 and are shown in table 1 fig 4 and table 1 showed that the degradation rates for the 6 dhams increased in the following order dcam bcam dbam ciam biam diam the decomposition of dhams by s iv for the substitution of halogen atoms in water increased in the following order chloro bromo iodo for the three iodine containing dhams more than 50 disappeared after 48 h of reaction whereas the loss of dcam can be ignored until 96 h results showed that no significant difference existed for the decomposition of dcam in the presence of s iv fig sm3 whereas there was a substantial discrepancy in the other dham degradation rates between the absence of s iv and the presence of s iv table s6 the rank order and relative activity of the reaction of hams with s iv are related to their bimolecular nucleophilic substitution reaction sn2 reactivity croue and reckhow 1989 owing to increasing bond length and decreasing dissociation energy the leaving tendency of the halogen in alkyl halides followed the order i br cl the sn2 reactivity of alkyl iodide was 3 fold to 5 fold greater than that of alkyl bromide which was 50 fold greater than that of alkyl chloride plewa et al 2004 the degradation rate of diam by s iv in this study was 2 4 fold greater than that of dbam which was several orders greater than that of dcam because of a more rapid reaction at a higher ph applying s iv under neutral or alkali conditions may be an efficient and promising method for the decomposition of brominated and iodinated hams which have significantly higher toxicity than chlorinated hams assuming that the hydrolysis and the competition from the other oxidants can be ignored eq 13 derived by eq 12 can be used to predict the ham concentration with time under specific ph and s iv concentration 13 h a m h a m 0 e k s o 3 2 α 1 s ⅳ t as the real ph value in natural waters is around 7 5 fig sm4 presents the modelled degradation kinetics of ham in the presence of 50 μm s iv at ph 7 5 based on eq 13 a rapid ham degradation was estimated at ph 7 5 fig sm4 it can be seen that the the time for a half of hams decomposition were 13 19 mins for iodinated dhams ciam biam and diam 30 42 mins for brominated dhams bcam and dbam and even 0 2 0 8 min for the brominated thams bdcam dbcam and tbam based on the rapid degradation of ham in a few mins a suggestion for ham analysis may be that the addition of s iv as a quenching agent resulted in substantial loss of hams during the holding time and should be avoided additionally considering that residual disinfectant is needed to prevent bio growth in drinking water distribution systems it was unsuitable to directly add sulfite into drinking water treatment plant effluents as shown in fig sm4 the half degradation times for brominated and iodinated hams at ph 7 with 50 μm sulfite were less than 1 h therefore it is better to apply sulfite nearby consumer point of use to remove hams and other potential dbps 3 4 products and mechanisms of hams degradation by s iv as shown in fig 5 a the concentration of tcam continuously decreased and the concentration of dcam as a product of tcam increased with time fig 5a demonstrates that trichloroacetic acid tcaa as another product of tcam formed after 24 h of contact and then gradually increased with time fig 5b c and 5d show that reactions of bdcam dbcam and tbam with s iv produced dcam bcam and dbam respectively the hydrolysis products i e haas for three brominated thams were unidentified for the short reaction time and lower hydrolysis reaction rates yu and reckhow 2015 the rank order of the instability of hams by substitution of halogen atoms in water was chloro bromo iodo which can be explained by the different electronegativity of the halogens ding et al 2018 glezer et al 1999 the difference about the effects of halogen substitute type on the hydrolysis and reductive degradation by s ⅳ was attributed to the different degradation mechanisms the higher electron withdrawing effect from the halogen activates amide carbon the more easily renders electrophilic attack yu and reckhow 2015 however there was a substantial discrepancy between the molar sum of the residual thams formed dhams i e dehalogenated species and corresponding haas and the initial tham doses fig 5 besides the mass balance was not attributed to the formation of mhams as mcams and mbams were not identified the molar concentration of tcam tcaa dcam fig 5a bdcam dcam fig 5b and dbcam bcam fig 5c decreased with time whereas the sum molar concentration of dbam and tbam fig 5d decreased initially and then increased the notable mass loss indicates that there must be some other unknown intermediate products which was reported as the first time previous studies indicated dichloronitromethane and dichloroacetonitrile were the main products of the reaction of sulfite with chloropicrin and tcan croue and reckhow 1989 shang et al 2005 it was also reported that the reaction of haloalkanes with sulfite generated alkyl sulfonate which was not observable via the solvent extraction procedure used for analysis of haloalkanes and alkyl sulfonate did not hydrolyse rapidly within the time frame of the experiments fam and stenstrom 1988 haag and mill 1988 during reductive dehalogenation hams decomposition occurred via nucleophilic attack by sulfite which is consistent with the sn2 mechanism rossi et al 2003 the α carbon bound to the amide group undergoes nucleophilic attack at 180 to the leaving group halide as this provides the best overlap between the nucleophile s lone pair and the c x σ antibonding orbital generating a transition state pentacoordinate kuder et al 2012 then the halide is pushed off the opposite side kuder et al 2012 breaking of the c x bond and formation of the new c s bond occur simultaneously to form dehalogenated products therefore this unknown immediate product was proposed to be ham sulfonate fig 6 ham sulfonate quite slowly hydrolyses to form corresponding hams haag and mill 1988 yiin et al 1987 which explained that the molar sum concentration of tbam and dbam first decreased and then increased fig 5d in addition experiments applying tcam 1 mg l and tbam 1 mg l reacted with 50 μm s iv at ph 7 0 were also conducted to quantify the halide concentrations fig sm5 shows that the halide concentrations are nearly equal to the initial ham concentrations when the tcam or tbam completely disappeared and neither mcam nor mbam were detected therefore the α carbon bound to the amide group undergoes nucleophilic attack by sulfite resulting in the degradation of hams fig 6 besides the nature of the substituents bound to carbon atom of the cx3 group influences the reaction rate due to its electron donor or withdrawing effect electron withdrawing groups make the carbon atom of the cx3 group more electrophilic so that the reaction rates of hams with s iv should be faster comparing the rates of chloropicrin tcan and tcam table 1 results show that the reaction rates increased with the increasing electron withdrawal of substituents no2 cn conh2 in an alternate mechanism fig sm6 the nucleophilic attack by sulfite occurs at halides rather than at α carbon bound to amide group resulting in the formation of a transition state via a proton transfer to ham as halide 1 transfers to the sulfur of sulfite previous studies showed that this proposed transition state was very unstable yiin et al 1987 yiin and margerum 1990 the first product of this reaction would be the halosulfate xso3 and corresponding dehalogenated ham yiin et al 1987 accordingly this reaction may also account for the formation of dehalogenated ham hence the nucleophilic attack by sulfite may also occur at the halide 4 conclusions under a ph range of 5 5 7 0 brominated and iodinated hams decompose immediately when exposed to s iv whereas the reactions of s iv with chlorinated hams i e dcam and tcam were much slower the results indicated that the degradation of hams exhibited pseudo first order reaction kinetics and the degradation rates of the 10 hams decreased in the following order tbam dbcam bdcam diam biam ciam dbam bcam tcam dcam the destruction of hams was primarily attributable to the chemical reduction pathway whereas the hydrolysis of hams excluding tcam can be ignored under ph 5 5 7 0 the degradation kinetics were well described by a second order kinetics model first order in s iv and first order in hams and the second order kinetics constants ranged from negligible quantity dcam to 5 24 106 m 1 h 1 tbam the reaction of s iv with hams is mainly with respect to sulfite rather than to bisulfite the degradation rates increased with increasing concentration of s iv and ph which can be explained by the increase of sulfite with the increase of ph the ham sulfonate was formed as the main intermediate product during hams decomposition via a nucleophilic substitution reaction on the α carbon bound to the amide group it should be noted that ham sulfonate was not directly identified by instruments based on the ham kinetic model established in this study the calculated brominated and iodinated ham half times in drinking water were less than 1 h in the condition of 50 μm s iv and ph 7 5 therefore the simple addition of s iv in drinking water may be a promising method to remove the brominated and iodinated hams which have significantly higher toxicity than chlorinated hams and many other aliphatic dbps and it is important to note for ham analysis that the addition of s iv as a quenching agent results in substantial loss of hams during the holding time between sample collection and analysis and thus it should be avoided during the collection of the ham sample

et al 2007 although the concentrations of hams were lower than those of regulated carbonaceous dbps c dbps including trihalomethanes thms and haloacetic acids haas they were nearly two orders of magnitude more cytotoxic and genotoxic in mammalian cell assays plewa et al 2008 the cytotoxicity and genotoxicity of the hams by halogen substituent types decrease in the following order iodo bromo chloro plewa et al 2008 the study of plewa and wagner even indicated that diiodoacetamide diam and monoiodoacetamide miam are the first and second most cytotoxic of 87 aliphatic dbps based on the fact that mammalian cell density is 50 compared to the control of the assay plewa and wagner 2015 therefore it is important to remove hams particularly brominated and iodinated ones according to their high toxicity richardson et al 2008 although the pre treatments to remove dbp precursors and the modification of disinfection methods can mitigate the formation of dbps chu et al 2015 chuang and mitch 2017 jiang et al 2017 li et al 2017 zhang et al 2017 dbps still presents ubiquitously in municipal drinking waters therefore the third category i e the removal of dbps after their formation is significantly important for drinking water safety especially relatively nontoxic low cost and effective methods for the mitigation of hams esp brominated and iodinated hams and other dbps are urgently needed a recent study investigated the effects of four commonly used quenching agents i e sodium sulfite s iv sodium thiosulfate ascorbic acid and ammonium chloride on the stability of hams results showed that s iv at a low dosage 20 μm and ph of 7 0 led to a quick loss of hams compared to the three other quenching agents ding et al 2018 a previous study also indicated that several aliphatic dbps were all adversely affected by s iv between sample collection at the sampling sites and analysis in the laboratory kristiana et al 2014 it was also reported that trichloroacetonitrile tcan chloropicrin and cyanogen chloride all reacted with s iv to form dehalogenated species i e dichloroacetonitrile dichloronitromethane and cyanogen respectively via dehalogenation reactions croue and reckhow 1989 shang et al 2005 yiin et al 1987 comprehensively explored the degradation of chloramines including monochloramine dichloroamine and trichloroamine in the presence of s iv and results indicated that reduction was proceeded through the transition state formed by nucleophilic attack of sulfite on cl coupled with proton donation to the non bonding electron pair of n by h3o or by a buffer acid batterman et al 2000 also some studies indicated that carbon bound to the halide was subjected to nucleophile attack by sulfite during the reduction of 3 bromopropene 2 bromopropene and 1 bromoxehexane fam and stenstrom 1988 haag and mill 1988 a common oxidation product of s iv is sulfate which is relatively nontoxic xie 2003 summarized the degradation kinetics of a range of chlorinated and brominated dbps however the degradation kinetics and reaction mechanisms of dbps especially for the highly toxic iodinated hams in the presence of s iv are still unknown and require to be further investigated the objectives of this study were to investigate the degradation kinetics of 10 hams including dichloroacetamide dcam bromochloroacetamide bcam dibromoacetamide dbam chloroiodoacetamide ciam bromoiodoacetamide biam diam trichloroacetamide tcam bromodichloroacetamide bdcam dibromochloroacetamide dbcam and tribromoacetamide tbam by s iv and to obtain a fundamental understanding of ham decomposition mechanisms as well as the nature of consequent reaction products in the presence of s iv this study will provide new insight about the selective mitigation of bromianted and iodinated dbps in drinking water by a easy operation and low costs method 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials monochloroacetamide mcam dcam and tcam were obtained from alfa aesar karlsruhe germany monobromoacetamide mbam and miam were obtained from sigma aldrich st louis usa bcam dbam ciam biam diam bdcam dbcam and tbam were all purchased from cansyn chem corp toronto canada the hams were dissolved separately in methanol 2 mg ml to prepare ham stock solutions and then stored at 4 c the haa mixed standard containing 9 haas was supplied by supelco st louis usa s iv 99 and methyl tert butyl ether mtbe were obtained from aladdin industrial inc shanghai china s iv solution was freshly prepared by dissolving s iv in ultrapure water before use all other chemical reagents were at least analytical grade and obtained from sinopharm chemical reagent co ltd shanghai china unless otherwise noted all solutions were prepared using ultrapure water produced by a millipore milli q gradient water purification system 18 mώ cm billerica usa 2 2 experimental procedures batch experiments were performed in 1 l transparent glass volumetric bottles in the dark at 25 0 0 5 c into 1 l of 10 mm phosphate buffer ph 6 0 50 μl of individual trihalogenated ham tham stocking solution 2 mg ml in methanol was introduced to obtain the desired initial ham concentration i e 100 μg l at the start of each experiment and then the predetermined volumes of s iv was injected into the aqueous samples to obtain the desired initial concentrations 0 2 5 5 7 5 and 10 μm the degradation of 4 thams with 5 μm s iv under ph 5 5 6 0 6 5 and 7 0 10 mm phosphate buffer were performed to investigate the effect of ph on the degradation of thams in addition to compare the effect of halogen substituent types of hams on the degradation rates the degradation of 6 dihalogenated hams dhams i e dcam bcam dbam ciam biam and diam with 5 μm s iv at ph 6 was conducted for each experiment a reference group with only hams without s iv was added to distinguish the ham hydrolysis from the reduction by s iv after predetermined time intervals desired portions of the aqueous solution were withdrawn for dbp concentration analysis a previous study demonstrated that the tcan and chloropicrin underwent decomposition to form corresponding dehalogenated species in the presence of sulfite croue and reckhow 1989 to verify and elucidate the degradation pathway of the reaction of hams with sulfite three dhams and two monohalogenated hams mhams were also targeted during the degradation of hams at ph 6 0 the volatilization of hams and haas is negligible owing to their high boiling points the error bars in all figures represent the relative standard deviation of three analyses 2 3 analytical methods hams were immediately extracted at the end of the predetermined reaction time by adding 2 ml mtbe to a 10 ml aqueous sample which was then shaken for 3 min using a multi tube vortex mixer dmt 2500 shanghai china at 2300 rpm the hams were analysed immediately using a gas chromatograph equipped with an electron capture detector gc ecd shimadzu corporation qp2010plus japan haas were derivatized to their corresponding esters using 10 sulfuric acid in methanol v v and were analysed by the shimadzu qp2010plus gc coupled with a qp2020 mass spectrometer gc ms korshin et al 2007 injections of 1 0 μl of mtbe extract were separated via a splitless injector onto a gc column rtx 5ms 30 m 0 25 mm id 0 25 μm film thickness detailed information about the dbp analysis methods is available in the supplementary materials table s1 and described in a previous study chu et al 2016a chloride and bromide were measured using an ion chromatography dionex ics 1000 usa chu et al 2011 3 results and discussion 3 1 kinetics of ham degradation under different doses of s iv the degradation of 4 thams were conducted individually under ph 6 0 condition with five different s iv doses 0 2 5 5 7 5 and 10 μm the ph of aqueous solutions were buffed at ph 6 0 because the degradation of three brominated thams by s iv at alkali conditions is too fast to determine the degradation kinetic constants during initial experiments as is evident in fig 1 the relationship between ham molar concentration and time was consistent with pseudo first order reaction kinetics for the degradation of hams by s iv the overall reaction can be expressed by eq 1 using kobs as the pseudo first order observed rate constant rearranging and integrating eq 1 produces eq 2 the kobs values for the degradation of hams in the presence of s iv can be calculated from the slope of the fitted line in fig 1 and are shown in table s2 it should be noted that neutral water and hydroxide also result in the hydrolysis of hams chu et al 2009 yu and reckhow 2015 as shown in fig 1a slight tcam degradation was observed in the absence of s iv while the presence of s iv resulted in a rapid loss of the thams therefore hams was predominantly degraded through the reaction of the hams with s iv and the hydrolysis of hams is minor fate mechanism for hams degradation kobs can be expressed by eq 3 in eq 3 kh and ks represent the hydrolysis and s iv reaction rate constants respectively 1 d h a m d t k o b s h a m 2 ln ham ln ham 0 k o b s t 3 k o b s k h k s 4 k o b s k h k a p p s ⅳ fig 1 and table s2 show that the degradation rate of hams increased with the increase of s iv concentration demonstrating that s iv concentration drove ham degradation based on the previous study shang et al 2005 kobs can be expressed via a hierarchical structure which is proposed in eq 4 in which kapp represents the apparent second reaction rate constant of s iv kobs was fitted for the degradation of hams at different s iv concentrations through the application of linear least squares regression and by fixing the intercept at the kobs value in the absence of s iv fig sm1 the hydrolysis rate constants of the hams were determined and were shown in table s3 strong linear regressions between s iv concentration and kobs r2 0 98 indicated that the reaction between the hams and s iv followed second order kinetics it should be noted that the degradation of other dbps by activated carbon or other treatment methods follow the two stage degradation kinetic tung et al 2006 xie 2003 the difference of the degradation kinetics for hams and other dbps was attributed to the different degradation mechanisms fig 1 illustrates that s iv reacted immediately with three brominated hams i e bdcam dbcam and tbam resulting in the quick loss of brominated hams within 2 h under a s iv concentration of 10 μm however the decomposition of tcam was far slower than the brominated analogues and tcam was not eliminated after 120 h of contact under the same conditions the degradation rates for these four thams increased in the following order tcam bdcam dbcam tbam which was consistent with a previous study indicating that compared with chlorinated hams brominated hams were more easily reduced by zero valent iron zvi chu et al 2016b in general the degradation of hams by the substitution of halogen atoms in the presence of s iv decreased in the following order bromo chloro which was attributed to the different bond lengths and decreasing dissociation energies of the halogens croue and reckhow 1989 these phenomena will be discussed in detail in section 3 3 3 2 kinetics of ham degradation at different ph levels the reactivity of s iv depends on its speciation which is ph dependent eqs 5 and 6 croue and reckhow 1989 the α0 and α1 of eq 6 represent the distribution fractions of bisulfite and sulfite at a specific ph to determine the effects of different s iv species i e sulfite and bisulfite on the decomposition of hams the degradation of four thams i e tcam bdcam dbcam and tbam with an initial s iv concentration of 5 μm at ph 5 5 6 0 6 5 and 7 0 conditions was investigated in fig 2 it is too fast to examine the degradation kinetics of three brominted thams at the alkali conditions the degradation of tcam was relatively slow compared to the brominated thams at all ph levels which was consistent with last section at ph 5 5 the three brominated thams were incompletely degraded up to 7 h whereas they were completely degraded at ph 7 0 within 1 h as the same s iv concentration as for the tcam less than half of it was decomposed at ph 5 5 after 120 h similar to that in the last section the relationship between ham molar concentration and time was consistent with pseudo first order reaction kinetics for the degradation of hams at different ph levels and the kobs can be calculated from the slope of the linear least squares regression fitted line in fig 2 eq 2 5 h s o 3 s o 3 2 h k a i 5 6 10 8 m 6 α 0 h h k a i α 1 k a i h k a i 7 d h a m d t k h k h s o 3 h s o 3 t k s o 3 2 s o 3 2 t h a m 8 d h a m d t k h k h s o 3 α 0 s ⅳ k s o 3 2 α 1 s ⅳ h a m 9 ln ham ln ham 0 k h t k

relationship between hams decomposition and the sulfite the calculated apparent second order rate constants kapp for hams decomposition and the distribution of sulfite and bisulfite under different phs are presented in fig 3 with the increase of ph the distribution ratio of sulfite and bisulfite increased that is sulfite percentage increased and the calculated kapp for hams decomposition increased the positive relationship of kapp and sulfite levels indicates that the reaction of hams with s iv might depend on sulfite the ph dependence of the full second order rate constants can be formulated by eqs 7 and 8 to determine the specific reaction rate constants of sulfite and bisulfite rearranging and integrating eq 8 results in eq 9 substituting eq 10 into eq 4 results in eq 11 thereby the apparent second order rate constants kapp for the degradation of hams by considering ham reactivity with each of these two forms of s iv can be expressed as eq 11 then the k h s o 3 and k s o 3 2 values for the degradation of hams can be calculated via the non linear least squares regression and the reaction rate constants are shown in table s5 results showed that the values for k s o 3 2 were nearly two orders of magnitude higher than the k h s o 3 values for the degradation of individual hams a previous study also indicated that the role of bisulfite can be neglected during the degradation of chloropicrin and hans croue and reckhow 1989 this is expected as sulfite is a much stronger nucleophile than bisulfite croue and reckhow 1989 therefore the second order degradation kinetics for hams can be expressed using eq 12 by dropping the bisulfite term resulting in the higher degrees of freedom for kinetic functions the k s o 3 2 values can be calculated from the slope of the fitted line in fig sm2 and are shown in table 1 good linear fit r2 0 98 in fig sm2 further confirmed that sulfite is the only reactive s iv ion for hams degradation 3 3 effect of halogen substituent types of hams on the degradation rates fig 4 presents the reaction of s iv with six dhams including dcam bcam dbam ciam biam and diam at ph 6 0 to investigate the effect of halogen substituent types on the degradation of hams similar to previous sections the pseudo first order observed rate constant kobs values for the degradation of dhams in the presence of s iv can be calculated from the slope of the fitted line in fig 4 and are shown in table s6 the hydrolysis constants for 6 dhams at ph 6 0 were also shown in table s6 the k s o 3 2 values for the degradation of dhams can be calculated using eq 12 and are shown in table 1 fig 4 and table 1 showed that the degradation rates for the 6 dhams increased in the following order dcam bcam dbam ciam biam diam the decomposition of dhams by s iv for the substitution of halogen atoms in water increased in the following order chloro bromo iodo for the three iodine containing dhams more than 50 disappeared after 48 h of reaction whereas the loss of dcam can be ignored until 96 h results showed that no significant difference existed for the decomposition of dcam in the presence of s iv fig sm3 whereas there was a substantial discrepancy in the other dham degradation rates between the absence of s iv and the presence of s iv table s6 the rank order and relative activity of the reaction of hams with s iv are related to their bimolecular nucleophilic substitution reaction sn2 reactivity croue and reckhow 1989 owing to increasing bond length and decreasing dissociation energy the leaving tendency of the halogen in alkyl halides followed the order i br cl the sn2 reactivity of alkyl iodide was 3 fold to 5 fold greater than that of alkyl bromide which was 50 fold greater than that of alkyl chloride plewa et al 2004 the degradation rate of diam by s iv in this study was 2 4 fold greater than that of dbam which was several orders greater than that of dcam because of a more rapid reaction at a higher ph applying s iv under neutral or alkali conditions may be an efficient and promising method for the decomposition of brominated and iodinated hams which have significantly higher toxicity than chlorinated hams assuming that the hydrolysis and the competition from the other oxidants can be ignored eq 13 derived by eq 12 can be used to predict the ham concentration with time under specific ph and s iv concentration 13 h a m h a m 0 e k s o 3 2 α 1 s ⅳ t as the real ph value in natural waters is around 7 5 fig sm4 presents the modelled degradation kinetics of ham in the presence of 50 μm s iv at ph 7 5 based on eq 13 a rapid ham degradation was estimated at ph 7 5 fig sm4 it can be seen that the the time for a half of hams decomposition were 13 19 mins for iodinated dhams ciam biam and diam 30 42 mins for brominated dhams bcam and dbam and even 0 2 0 8 min for the brominated thams bdcam dbcam and tbam based on the rapid degradation of ham in a few mins a suggestion for ham analysis may be that the addition of s iv as a quenching agent resulted in substantial loss of hams during the holding time and should be avoided additionally considering that residual disinfectant is needed to prevent bio growth in drinking water distribution systems it was unsuitable to directly add sulfite into drinking water treatment plant effluents as shown in fig sm4 the half degradation times for brominated and iodinated hams at ph 7 with 50 μm sulfite were less than 1 h therefore it is better to apply sulfite nearby consumer point of use to remove hams and other potential dbps 3 4 products and mechanisms of hams degradation by s iv as shown in fig 5 a the concentration of tcam continuously decreased and the concentration of dcam as a product of tcam increased with time fig 5a demonstrates that trichloroacetic acid tcaa as another product of tcam formed after 24 h of contact and then gradually increased with time fig 5b c and 5d show that reactions of bdcam dbcam and tbam with s iv produced dcam bcam and dbam respectively the hydrolysis products i e haas for three brominated thams were unidentified for the short reaction time and lower hydrolysis reaction rates yu and reckhow 2015 the rank order of the instability of hams by substitution of halogen atoms in water was chloro bromo iodo which can be explained by the different electronegativity of the halogens ding et al 2018 glezer et al 1999 the difference about the effects of halogen substitute type on the hydrolysis and reductive degradation by s ⅳ was attributed to the different degradation mechanisms the higher electron withdrawing effect from the halogen activates amide carbon the more easily renders electrophilic attack yu and reckhow 2015 however there was a substantial discrepancy between the molar sum of the residual thams formed dhams i e dehalogenated species and corresponding haas and the initial tham doses fig 5 besides the mass balance was not attributed to the formation of mhams as mcams and mbams were not identified the molar concentration of tcam tcaa dcam fig 5a bdcam dcam fig 5b and dbcam bcam fig 5c decreased with time whereas the sum molar concentration of dbam and tbam fig 5d decreased initially and then increased the notable mass loss indicates that there must be some other unknown intermediate products which was reported as the first time previous studies indicated dichloronitromethane and dichloroacetonitrile were the main products of the reaction of sulfite with chloropicrin and tcan croue and reckhow 1989 shang et al 2005 it was also reported that the reaction of haloalkanes with sulfite generated alkyl sulfonate which was not observable via the solvent extraction procedure used for analysis of haloalkanes and alkyl sulfonate did not hydrolyse rapidly within the time frame of the experiments fam and stenstrom 1988 haag and mill 1988 during reductive dehalogenation hams decomposition occurred via nucleophilic attack by sulfite which is consistent with the sn2 mechanism rossi et al 2003 the α carbon bound to the amide group undergoes nucleophilic attack at 180 to the leaving group halide as this provides the best overlap between the nucleophile s lone pair and the c x σ antibonding orbital generating a transition state pentacoordinate kuder et al 2012 then the halide is pushed off the opposite side kuder et al 2012 breaking of the c x bond and formation of the new c s bond occur simultaneously to form dehalogenated products therefore this unknown immediate product was proposed to be ham sulfonate fig 6 ham sulfonate quite slowly hydrolyses to form corresponding hams haag and mill 1988 yiin et al 1987 which explained that the molar sum concentration of tbam and dbam first decreased and then increased fig 5d in addition experiments applying tcam 1 mg l and tbam 1 mg l reacted with 50 μm s iv at ph 7 0 were also conducted to quantify the halide concentrations fig sm5 shows that the halide concentrations are nearly equal to the initial ham concentrations when the tcam or tbam completely disappeared and neither mcam nor mbam were detected therefore the α carbon bound to the amide group undergoes nucleophilic attack by sulfite resulting in the degradation of hams fig 6 besides the nature of the substituents bound to carbon atom of the cx3 group influences the reaction rate due to its electron donor or withdrawing effect electron withdrawing groups make the carbon atom of the cx3 group more electrophilic so that the reaction rates of hams with s iv should be faster comparing the rates of chloropicrin tcan and tcam table 1 results show that the reaction rates increased with the increasing electron withdrawal of substituents no2 cn conh2 in an alternate mechanism fig sm6 the nucleophilic attack by sulfite occurs at halides rather than at α carbon bound to amide group resulting in the formation of a transition state via a proton transfer to ham as halide 1 transfers to the sulfur of sulfite previous studies showed that this proposed transition state was very unstable yiin et al 1987 yiin and margerum 1990 the first product of this reaction would be the halosulfate xso3 and corresponding dehalogenated ham yiin et al 1987 accordingly this reaction may also account for the formation of dehalogenated ham hence the nucleophilic attack by sulfite may also occur at the halide 4 conclusions under a ph range of 5 5 7 0 brominated and iodinated hams decompose immediately when exposed to s iv whereas the reactions of s iv with chlorinated hams i e dcam and tcam were much slower the results indicated that the degradation of hams exhibited pseudo first order reaction kinetics and the degradation rates of the 10 hams decreased in the following order tbam dbcam bdcam diam biam ciam dbam bcam tcam dcam the destruction of hams was primarily attributable to the chemical reduction pathway whereas the hydrolysis of hams excluding tcam can be ignored under ph 5 5 7 0 the degradation kinetics were well described by a second order kinetics model first order in s iv and first order in hams and the second order kinetics constants ranged from negligible quantity dcam to 5 24 106 m 1 h 1 tbam the reaction of s iv with hams is mainly with respect to sulfite rather than to bisulfite the degradation rates increased with increasing concentration of s iv and ph which can be explained by the increase of sulfite with the increase of ph the ham sulfonate was formed as the main intermediate product during hams decomposition via a nucleophilic substitution reaction on the α carbon bound to the amide group it should be noted that ham sulfonate was not directly identified by instruments based on the ham kinetic model established in this study the calculated brominated and iodinated ham half times in drinking water were less than 1 h in the condition of 50 μm s iv and ph 7 5 therefore the simple addition of s iv in drinking water may be a promising method to remove the brominated and iodinated hams which have significantly higher toxicity than chlorinated hams and many other aliphatic dbps and it is important to note for ham analysis that the addition of s iv as a quenching agent results in substantial loss of hams during the holding time between sample collection and analysis and thus it should be avoided during the collection of the ham sample

19434,the emergence of antibiotic resistance represents a major threat to human health in this work we investigated the elimination of antibiotic resistant bacteria arb by solar light and solar photo fenton processes as such we have designed an experimental plan in which several bacterial strains staphylococcus aureus escherichia coli and klebsiella pneumoniae possessing different drug susceptible and resistant patterns and structures gram positive and gram negative were subjected to solar light and the photo fenton oxidative treatment in water we showed that both solar light and solar photo fenton processes were effective in the elimination of arb in water and that the time necessary for solar light disinfection and solar photo fenton disinfection were similar for antibiotic susceptible and antibiotic resistant strains mostly 180 240 and 90 120 min respectively moreover the bacterial structure did not significantly affect the effectiveness of the treatment similar regrowth pattern was observed compared to the susceptible strain and no development of bacteria with higher drug resistance values was found in waters after any treatment finally both processes were effective to reduce ar genes args although solar photo fenton was more rapid than solar light in conclusion the solar photo fenton process ensured effective disinfection of arb and elimination of args in water or wastewater and is a potential mean to ensure limitation of arb and arg spread in nature graphical abstract image 1 keywords solar disinfection sodis advanced oxidation process aops water treatment

numerous environments e g hospitals hocquet et al 2016 waters dodd 2012 or crops ferro et al 2015b and are a major threat for human health as an example we can highlight the emergence of ciprofloxacin resistant escherichia coli fasugba et al 2015 and of colistin resistant enterobacteriae poirel et al 2016 ciprofloxacin is the main fluoroquinolone prescribed for urinary tract infections a disease affecting 150 million people per annum worldwide as well as for more severe infections such as septicemia fasugba et al 2015 another example colistin is considered the antibiotic of last resort for the treatment of carbapenem resistant bacteria osei sekyere et al 2016 arb kill approximately 700 000 people worldwide each year and there is currently a lack or shortage of new effective antibiotics in the clinical pipeline willyard 2017 one alternative to decrease the threat posed by arb could be their minimization by the so called advanced oxidation processes in urban wastewater treatment plant effluents before their disposal into the environment michael kordatou et al 2018 sharma et al 2016 these processes have been already employed for the treatment decontamination and disinfection of wastewater a reservoir of arb the aops lead to the generation of reactive oxygen species ros such as hydroxyl radicals ho that inactivate bacteria and other microorganisms such as fungi garcía fernández et al 2012 giannakis et al 2016b viruses giannakis et al 2017a 2017b kim et al 2010 nieto juarez et al 2010 and helminth eggs bandala et al 2012 aops can also degrade contaminants of emerging concern giannakis et al 2015 including antibiotics alongside disinfection giannakis et al 2016c michael kordatou et al 2015 among the conventional and aops used against arb it is worth mentioning chlorination ozonation and photocatalytic processes chlorination is a conventional water disinfection process in reason of its effectiveness and of chlorine availability its ability to totally inactivate ar e coli within 2 5 min of contact in surface water at an initial chlorine concentration of 1 0 mg l was demonstrated miranda et al 2016 nevertheless this disinfection method has some drawbacks related with toxic disinfection byproducts such as total organic halogens zhu and zhang 2016 in addition antibiotic resistant genes args are not removed after wastewater chlorination yuan et al 2015 ozonation is an aop that produces hydroxyl radicals but also undesired disinfection by products von gunten 2003 it is able to disinfect microorganisms but not to control args spread sousa et al 2017 unless combined with photocatalysis moreira et al 2016 photocatalytic processes include for instance the use of tio2 and irradiation it has been shown that methicillin resistant staphylococcus aureus mrsa and other ar bacteria are inactivated using uva tio2 tsai et al 2010 in addition n doped tio2 photocatalysis was found to inactivate ar e coli in treated urban wastewater but without reducing the resistance to antibiotics rizzo et al 2014 solar light alone solar h2o2 and solar photo fenton have also been used to disinfect arb ferro et al 2015a fiorentino et al 2015 giannakis et al 2018b rizzo et al 2013 the solar disinfection process inactivates arb based principally on the uv wavelengths from sunlight uv radiation can damage dna by mutations strand breaks and induction of photoproducts giannakis et al 2016a the solar h2o2 process enhanced solar disinfection by addition of h2o2 in solution h2o2 diffuses through the bacterial membrane and accelerates the killing process fiorentino et al 2015 h2o2 has an oxidative power and can affect the fe s clusters to release iron ions which allowed initiation of internal photo fenton reactions as described elsewhere giannakis 2018 the solar photo fenton process further improved solar disinfection by addition of h2o2 and of fe2 in solution to produce hydroxyl radicals that degrade the external membrane of bacteria increase the permeability induce internal reactions and eventually inactivates the cell giannakis et al 2018a a reduction in the number of different arg has been reported for solar photo fenton karaolia et al 2014 zhang et al 2016 making it an interesting treatment to eliminate the spread of args into the environment despite these reports however there is a lack of systematic studies that account for the recent developments in arbs and for whether or not solar based aops are actually capable of eradicating these bacteria as well as args in this work we have employed a series of s aureus e coli and k pneumoniae ar strains and have researched the capability of solar light and its enhancement by the photo fenton process to efficiently inactivate them to this end we have compared the relative response to solar aops of i structurally different strains ii isogenic susceptible and resistant strains and iii single drug vs multi drug resistant strains including bacteria resistant to last resort drugs also we have assessed the effect of solar based aops on ar and the risk of selection towards resistant strains finally the regrowth of resistant strains after treatment and the elimination of two relevant args were also monitored 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemicals and reagents for the photo fenton process h2o2 30 w w and feso4 7h2o were purchased from sigma aldrich buchs

agar tsa brain heart infusion agar bhia tryptic soy broth tsb mueller hinton broth mhb were ordered from bd becton dickinson and company eysins switzerland as well as the ceftazidime caz 30 μg and ceftazidime plus clavulanic acid caz cla 30 μg 10 μg discs catalase from bovine liver is coming from sigma aldrich for the electrophoresis agarose and 1 kb dna ladder were purchased from promega dübendorf switzerland while sybr safe dna gel stain was purchased from invitrogen basel switzerland 2 2 bacterial strains and growth conditions the bacterial strains used in this study are listed in table 1 and include 10 s aureus 4 e coli and 2 k pneumoniae from different collections or geographical origins bacterial were stored frozen in tsb containing 10 v v glycerol at 80 c and sub cultured on bhia plates to ensure purity before testing all bacterial strains were grown at 37 c in tsb or bhia plates 2 3 solar and solar photo fenton disinfection methods 2 3 1 disinfection processes experiments were performed with a suntest apparatus heraeus hanau germany at an irradiation level of 750 w m2 emitted by a 150 w xenon lamp the emission spectra from the manufacturer is provided in the supplementary fig s1 more details on the illumination source can be found elsewhere giannakis et al 2014 pyrex graduated erlenmeyer flasks with screw cap were used as reactors for each reactor the starting bacterial concentration was 106 cfu ml in 40 ml of ultrapure water reactors were exposed to simulated sunlight illumination and kept under agitation until the end of experiment in the case of solar photo fenton process 10 mg l h2o2 and 1 mg l fe2 from feso4 7h2o were added in the reactor to get a fe2 h2o2 ratio of 1 10 before simulated sunlight exposure the starting ph was 6 5 and remained without changes in solar exposure tests and only slightly decreased in photo fenton processes around 6 1 6 2 thanks to the low iron addition the choice of iron amount is done at a low level close to the limits posed by the who for drinking water 0 6 mg l and h2o2 is semi arbitrarily chosen in an amount high enough to see a change in kinetics but low enough to allow their study and avoid high extracellular oxidation of bacterial cells uhl and dukan 2016 world health organization 2003 at different times during the inactivation process samples 0 1 1 ml see below were taken from the glass reactors during inactivation experiments for colony counts samples 0 1 ml were serially diluted and plated on bhia plates colony counts were performed after incubation of the plates at 37 c for 24 h the results were expressed in cfu ml and normalized to the inoculum at the onset of disinfection 106 cfu ml for the comparison of disinfection kinetics modeling of the inactivation curves took place using the ginafit add on for excel geeraerd et al 2005 and the shoulder log linear decay model was fit to the curves geeraerd et al 2000 the model is as follows 1 n n 0 exp k m a x t exp k m a x s l 1 exp k m a x s l 1 exp k m a x t for identification purposes it can be presented as 2 l o g 10 n l o g 10 n 0 k t t s ln 10 l o g 10 1 exp k t s 1 exp k t the variables of equations 1 and 2 are n the bacterial concentration at time t cfu ml n0 the initial bacterial numbers cfu ml t time s ts or sl is the length of the lag phase period also known as shoulder length k or kmax is the rate i e the maximum slope the last two are the model parameters to be fitted every time 2 3 2 bacterial regrowth experiments for bacterial regrowth experiments the bacterial preparation and experimental conditions were as described above in the context of sodis water is exposed one day and then kept in the house until consumption dark storage so here after the end of the simulated sunlight exposure samples 0 4 ml were taken and kept in the dark at room temperature for 24 h and 48 h samples undergoing solar photo fenton inactivation were conserved in two exemplars one with catalase 100 μl of stock diluted 100 times added directly after sampling and one without catalase addition catalase is the enzyme accelerating the decomposition of h2o2 to h2o and o2 hence the two parallel samples allow the investigation of the damage that took place up to that point or the continuous dark fenton process by the presence of residual oxidants samples were then plated on bhia plates for colony counts as described above 2 4 antibiotic susceptibility minimum inhibitory concentrations mics of antibiotics for the arb were determined by broth micro dilution method in mhb in each test an antibiotic susceptible strain was used as control wells were inoculated with bacterial suspension at a turbidity around 1 2 mcfarland approximately 108 cfu ml after incubation of the plates for 24 h at 37 c the mics were defined as the lowest concentration of antibiotic that yielded no visible growth to define strains as susceptible or resistant breakpoints recommended by the european committee on antimicrobial susceptibility testing eucast were followed eucast 2018 2 5 detection of extended spectrum β lactamase esbl genes the presence of the predominant esbl genes bla ctx m 1 and bla ctx m 9 in the model organism e coli esbl 8543 before and during the disinfection process was monitored by polymerase chain reaction pcr using specific primers table 2 and protocols previously described han et al 2016 for confirmatory esbl production e coli esbl 8543 was subjected to disc diffusion method by placing ceftazidime and ceftazidime clavulanate discs on the inoculated bhia plate at a distance of 25 mm apart plates were incubated overnight at 37 c and the inhibition zone sizes were recorded 3 results and discussion 3 1 comparison of solar and solar photo fenton disinfection for the elimination of structurally different arb strains bacteria have different structure features with the gram type is one of the most distinctive in disinfection studies rodríguez chueca et al 2014 gram positive have a thicker peptidoglycan layer than gram negative bacteria but the later ones have an additional outer membrane surrounding a thin peptidoglycan bolla et al 2011 as depicted in fig 1 we tested the antibiotic resistant strains mrsa atcc 43300 gram positive and e coli esbl 8543 gram negative as well as their antibiotic susceptible homologous s aureus atcc 29213 and e coli atcc 25922 disinfection of antibiotic resistant s aureus and e coli shows a similar trend as the antibiotic susceptible bacteria indicating that neither the distinction by gram type nor the susceptibility trait affects oxidative stress interestingly however s aureus and e coli were totally inactivated by solar photo fenton within 90 min while with solar light the disinfection is completed only after 240 min the antimicrobial efficiency order of the two processes was similar to what has been observed in the literature for other strains of gram positive bacteria such as mdr enterococcus faecalis compared to gram negative mdr e coli ferro et al 2015a fiorentino et al 2015 rubio et al 2013 another example was the inactivation of e faecalis by solar photo fenton with a 1 10 fe ii h2o2 ratio at ph 4 that reached the detection limit after 140 min while it was 180 min by solar alone in distilled water karaolia et al 2014 the inactivation difference in the study by karaloia et al is much less pronounced between those two processes than observed in our study the intracellular oxidative stress on e faecalis is reduced mainly by three enzymes of the peroxidase class la carbona et al 2007 e faecalis however has the possibility to generate catalase in presence of heme baureder et al 2012 finally as a separate mention we would like to highlight the difference in inactivation observed with the k pneumoniae strain 8534 compared to the other gram negative strains klebsiella produces a polysaccharide capsule that prevents cell desiccation allow adherence to surfaces and confer resistance to host immunity system paczosa and mecsas 2016 roberts 1996 the capsule under solar photo fenton stress has no strong influence in inactivation slightly delayed kinetics but solar light was ineffective the effect could be related to the presence of a capsule or as has been recently found serna galvis et al 2018 to the total number of dna bases to be affected in order to cause inactivation by the direct action of solar uv light ravanat et al 2001 as provisional conclusion we observed that the activity of solar photo fenton was independent of the bacterial structure and resistant phenotype the inactivation took place following very similar kinetics with lag phase and log linear k constants of very close values for detailed information interested readers should consult table s1 however the tested strains were not isogenic susceptible resistant and no assertive conclusions can be drawn therefore we further tested the activity of solar and solar photo fenton against isogenic susceptible resistant strains 3 2 solar and solar photo fenton disinfection comparisons against isogenic antibiotic susceptible and antibiotic resistant bacteria the influence of the acquisition of antibiotic resistance on bacterial inactivation was afterwards tested with solar and solar photo fenton against antibiotic susceptible as well as isogenic antibiotic resistant derivatives generated in the laboratory two methicillin susceptible s aureus strains mssa 1112 and mssa 133 and their isogenic rifampicin resistant strains mssa 1112 rifr and ciprofloxacin resistant mssa 1112 cipr and mssa 133 cip r mutants were used in addition the vancomycin susceptible mrsa pc1 and its vancomycin intermediate resistant derivative visa pc 3 sieradzki et al 1999 were also used as shown in fig 2 a and b the solar and solar photo fenton disinfection process showed similar inactivation profiles regardless of whether the bacteria are susceptible or resistant but with different disinfection times while s aureus are completely inactivated by solar photo fenton after approximately 90 of treatment the inactivation takes 180 min in the case of solar exposure the same tendency was observed with mrsa pc 1 and its derived visa pc 3 fig 2c these results with isogeneic pairs of susceptible resistant strains confirm that no general correlation exists between antibiotic resistance acquisition and increased resistance to solar light or solar photo fenton aop and that bacterial inactivation following solar photo fenton exposure is more rapid that after exposure to solar light alone also the neighboring kinetic model parameters of both solar and solar photo fenton disinfection confirm the similarity in the inactivation of both strains without differentiation according to the resistance table s1 3 3 inactivation of bacteria resistant to multiple antibiotics in previous experiments the activity of solar and solar photo fenton was performed on bacteria either susceptible or resistant to one single antibiotic however bacteria are often resistant to multiple antibiotics in order to assess whether multidrug resistant bacteria are more difficult to eliminate by solar and solar photo fenton than single drug resistant ones we tested a multidrug resistant mdr strain of s aureus mrsa aw25 as well as a multidrug resistant e coli strain s115 strain mrsa aw25 is resistant to methicillin rifampin and ciprofloxacin strain e coli s115 is a colistin and carbapenem resistant isolate poirel et al 2016 the isogenic strains mssa atcc 2913 and e coli atcc 25922 were used as antibiotic susceptible reference control strains to the aforementioned mdr ones as shown in fig 3 a we observed that mrsa aw25 was totally inactivated after 240 min by solar treatment and after 90 min by solar photo fenton exposure results which are in agreement with the previously determined disinfection time for s aureus strains figs 1 and 2 however the initial rate of inactivation after solar exposure is somewhat slower than for other s aureus studied so far table s1 indicates the aforementioned differences and the vicinity of the values in general also according to previous results with single drug resistant s aureus figs 1 and 2 the mechanism of resistance to either methicillin rifampin or ciprofloxacin alone can probably be excluded as the reason of increased solar resistance in order to be completely adamant for the lack of resistance to treatment some other tests with other resistances present in s aureus aw25 e g gentamicin and tetracycline should be done to determine the cause of slower initial killing of this strain by solar disinfection the colistin resistant e coli s115 fig 3c was completely inactivated by solar photo fenton within approximately 90 min similarly to e coli esbl 8543 and the susceptible strain atcc 25922 while it was not totally inactivated after 240 min of solar treatment 4 log decrease of the initial inoculum solar treatment totally inactivates at 240 min both the susceptible and esbl producing e coli strains in summary bacteria possessing resistance to multiple antibiotics including commonly used antibiotics as well antibiotics of last resort do not seem to have an enhanced resistance neither to solar nor towards solar photo fenton treatment the solar photo fenton process is again very effective and more rapid than solar treatment to decrease the bacterial population of multidrug resistant strains with total inactivation occurring within around 90 min for all those bacteria 3 4 bacterial regrowth after disinfection by solar and solar photo fenton processes the previous sections revealed that no significant changes were observed in the inactivation kinetics among antibiotic susceptible and antibiotic resistant bacteria in order to assess if there was a difference in the survival and regrowth response of these bacteria in solar and solar photo fenton treatment we have assessed the survival of a streptomycin resistant strain e coli w1485 by a method previously described giannakis et al 2018b michael et al 2012 as depicted in fig 4 a regrowth after solar treatment was manifested up to 3 h of exposure further treatment led to definite loss of viability within 24 or 48 h more importantly the total bacteria and the resistant fraction presented similar tendencies with minor differences this trend was also found after the solar photo fenton process fig 4b although no regrowth took place in presence of residual h2o2 that remained after treatment consequently although in different conditions from the rest of our tests that have a lack of nutrients in the matrix and lower h2o2 content for the photo fenton for the following strains and their regrowth potential we tested only the resistant strains and not their susceptible counterparts also elimination of h2o2 took also place in parallel test to assess the degree of cell injuries after treatment without the effect of the residual oxidative action the regrowth of two different antibiotic resistant bacteria e coli esbl 8543 and mrsa atcc 43300 were further examined during 2 days after solar and solar photo fenton treatment leading to partial or total disinfection fig 5 in solar photo fenton regrowth experiments two different storage conditions were tested with or without catalase addition to the samples in order to assess the effect of residual h2o2 in solution the samples were kept in water at room temperature without nutrients addition after solar treatment e coli esbl 8543 and mrsa atcc 43300 were totally inactivated after 300 and 240 min respectively fig 5a and d regrowth was observed after 2 days for samples taken at 60 and 120 min of exposure for e coli and after 60 min for mrsa while kinetics seem stable or with a small decrease for samples taken at 180 and 240 min for e coli or after 120 min for mrsa overall the ability to regrow was seen in early times when the inactivation process induced limited cell damages after a given time damages are likely too important and hindered the capacity of bacteria to multiply and a decrease of population is observed despite survival to the disinfection valero et al 2017 with regard to the solar photo fenton process total inactivation of both e coli and mrsa was achieved after 90 min of exposure fig 5b and e no regrowth was observed at any time after treatment even after a short disinfection time when solar photo fenton activity was tested in the presence of catalase the bacterial population remained stable for e coli fig 5c or increases slightly for mrsa fig 5f on day 1 and 2 after short exposition time less than 60 min most likely due to h2o2 removal contrarily to the experiments without catalase addition fig 5b and e after 60 min the bacterial count of both strains progressively decrease until reaching the detection limit on day 2 taken together the regrowth kinetics of e coli esbl 8543 and mrsa 43300 fig 5 and that of the streptomycin resistant e coli w1485 fig 4 suggest that the changes produced in the bacterial cells by the solar and oxidative treatment were irreversible and did not allow bacteria to recover 3 5 modification of antibiotic resistance during solar and solar photo fenton treatment and elimination of args 3 5 1 modification of mic during solar and solar photo fenton treatment the mic was used to determine whether or not bacteria were still resistant to their corresponding antibiotic after solar and solar photo fenton treatments the mics were determined for several strains with colonies isolated from agar plates at different time points of treatment 0 240 min only colonies from plates that had a considerable number of survivors were used the susceptible strain atcc 29213 was used as control and the eucast mic breakpoints to define susceptibility of resistance were followed the results of mic variations are summarized in table 3 the detailed results of the mic tests are provided in supplementary material table s2 the control strain atcc 29213 remained susceptible to the tested drugs as expected we observed that the resistance towards methicillin of mrsa atcc 43300 treated with solar or solar photo fenton remained unchanged with mics above the resistance breakpoint 2 μg ml and similar to those before exposure 8 32 μg ml these mics results indicate that mrsa strains do not lose their methicillin resistance during the treatment processes at any time point of exposure for this strain some variability of the methicillin mic value at certain time points was observed the fact that the resistance to methicillin is not homogeneous explains this variability mics of ciprofloxacin and rifampicin were performed as well on strain mrsa aw25 this strain kept its antibiotic resistance throughout solar and solar photo fenton processes with mics of 16 μg ml similar to those at the onset of therapy and well above the resistance breakpoints 1 and 0 5 μg ml respectively it has been shown that uv treatment was able to affect the ciprofloxacin resistance of mdr e coli while chlorination was not rizzo et al 2013 this suggests that uv exposure might be more effective than solar photo fenton to remove the antibiotic resistance determinant of antibiotics that damage the dna with regard to esbl producing bacteria these strains are able to degrade ceftazidime a β lactam antibiotic and become resistant to it esbl producing e coli and k pneumoniae were used to determine ceftazidime mic variation during solar and solar photo fenton exposure the ceftazidime susceptible e coli atcc 25922 and k pneumoniae atcc 27736 isolates were used as controls and were susceptible to the drug as expected some variability in the mic of ceftazidime with values going from 16 to 64 μg ml for e coli esbl 8543 and from 8 to 32 μg ml for k pneumoniae esbl 8534 were observed during both solar and solar photo fenton treatment the samples taken towards the end 60 min of each treatment for both e coli esbl 8543 and k pneumoniae 8534 showed 2 4 times decreased mics compared to the start of solar 64 and 16 μg ml respectively or solar photo fenton 64 and 32 μg ml respectively exposure however this diminution corresponds to only one or two fold dilutions which is not enough to assert that the effect is really due to the treatment since the variability of the mic method can fluctuate between two dilutions those mic values anyway are still above the ceftazidime resistant breakpoint 4 μg ml the persistence of esbl resistance after aop treatment was confirmed by the disk diffusion test on agar plates using discs containing ceftazidime or ceftazidime plus clavulanic acid which inhibits esbl production and e coli esbl 8543 and k pneumoniae esbl 8534 as tests organisms we observed that after solar photo fenton exposure the inhibition zone around the disc containing ceftazidime plus clavulanic acid is larger than the inhibition zone around the disc containing ceftazidime alone indicating that esbl is still produced see fig s2 of the supplementary material it has also been demonstrated that mdr e coli kept its resistances to ampicillin ciprofloxacin tetracycline and vancomycin after h2o2 sunlight treatment fiorentino et al 2015 this result was also seen with multiple resistances of mdr e coli after sodis h2o2 sunlight photo fenton tio2 sunlight and tio2 h2o2 sunlight treatments ferro et al 2015a finally we tested the evolution of colistin resistance using the colistin resistant strain e coli 5115 the colistin susceptible e coli atcc 25922 was used as control mic values of colistin for e coli 5115 during both aops exposure were generally 2 μg ml similar to the initial mic except for the solar disinfection at 120 min 1 μg ml nonetheless the latter value is only one dilution away from other determined mics and at 180 min of treatment it went back to the original mic all those values are considered as colistin resistant according to eucast breakpoint 2 μg ml and the large difference with the mic for the susceptible control 0 125 μg ml thus resistance to colistin also persisted during aop treatment in overall the mic tests performed on several bacterial strains for various antibiotics suggest that one single treatment by aops was not able to remove the antibiotic resistance trait of surviving bacteria during the treatment 3 5 2 mic modification after prolongation of treatment 3 repetitive photo fenton cycles since antibiotic resistance generally remained unchanged during a single run of bacterial inactivation test we performed repetitive solar photo fenton treatment in order to analyze whether bacterial resistance could be more affected by repetition of the treatment to this end survivors of the same bacteria tested above and recovered on agar plates after the first cycle of exposure were grown again and re inactivated in the same conditions for 2 more cycles fig 6 mics after a single treatment were then compared to mics after 3 treatments as shown in table 4 after 3 cycles of treatment the mics values of methicillin ciprofloxacin and rifampin for mrsa the mic values of ceftazidime against esbl isolates and the mic value of colistin for the colistin resistant strain s115 were still above the resistant breakpoints as after a single treatment thus the arb conserved their resistant phenotype after multiple aop exposure in the case of mrsa atcc 433300 the mic of methicillin decreased 4 times compared to the mic after a single exposure in the case of e coli esbl 8543 for ceftazidime and of e coli s115 for colisitn the mics after 3 cycles increased 4 times as compared to one single treatment it is possible that stress caused by multiple treatments could modify the outer membrane of the bacteria decreasing the penetration of ceftazidime or reducing the affinity of colistin for its target the lipid a for instance with a loss of its negative charge wand et al 2015 overall these results suggest that the repetition of exposure to aops is not effective in suppressing the antibiotic resistance all mic values are above the resistant breakpoints and that even can push towards more resistant strains 3 6 args degradation by solar and solar photo fenton monitoring by pcr since aops and particularly the solar photo fenton process are able to eliminate every arb tested but their resistance remains even after repeated treatment this suggests that aops are not able to affect their args so the question arises as to whether the genes responsible for antibiotic resistance can be found in the lysate after bacterial inactivation and potentially be acquired by other cells by transformation in order to assess the fate of the antibiotic resistance genes args during and after aop treatment pcr was used to amplify genes responsible for esbl production in e coli esbl 8543 as a representative strain esbl producing bacteria resist to β lactam antibiotics by the production of different types of β lactamases coded by bla genes the most prevalent esbl genes in many countries are bla ctx m 1 and bla ctx m 9 elhassan et al 2016 overdevest et al 2011 therefore the presence of these two genes was tested in e coli esbl 8543 no amplification was observed for the bla ctx m 1 gene fig 7 a only bla ctx m 9 was present in e coli esbl 8543 with a band observed between 750 and 1000 bp which corresponds to the size of the amplified bla ctx m 9 gene 868 bp in order to investigate the degradation of bla ctx m 9 during the disinfection we performed pcr with samples taken at different times during both solar and solar photo fenton treatment the gene bla ctx m 9 was present in e coli esbl 8543 all along the solar disinfection fig 7b the intensity of the signal however decreased with treatment time suggesting an effect of the solar exposure on the gene since the gene was not totally degraded in the lysate this suggests that its spread is possible after the death of the bacteria the bla ctx m 9 gene was also present in the sample taken before the solar photo fenton treatment lane 10 but any amplification was observed after 15 min of exposure whether the absence of amplification from 15 min onwards was due to a fast elimination of the bla ctx m 9 gene by solar photo fenton should be confirmed with other esbl producing bacteria like k pneumoniae several examples of the fate of args during relevant aops have been described for instance the intracellular concentration of bla tem gene another gene responsible for esbl production decreased during mdr e coli uv h2o2 disinfection ferro et al 2016 however this decrease was not caused by the disinfection process but by the reduced number of surviving bacteria to extract dna during the process the study by ferro et al also showed that the uv h2o2 process was unable to remove other args indeed bla tem qnrs quinolone resistance and tetw tetracycline resistance were still detected after 240 min of treatment the repeated experiment gave the same result after 300 min of treatment with bla tem at the same concentration as before the disinfection ferro et al 2017 this comes as small surprise considering that the action of the generated ho is prevalently external on the contrary our applied solar photo fenton process was proven to be an intracellular process giannakis et al 2018a another study showed using qpcr a reduction in wastewater by fenton and uv h2o2 processes of sul1 tetx tetg and intl1 genes but the removal was partial zhang et al 2016 in our work the tests of arb elimination with solar disinfection suggest that the risk of ar spread after such treatment cannot be overlooked due to remnant args in solution after bacterial inactivation maybe only if the exposure is prolonged enough this risk could be negligible on the other hand solar photo fenton treatment of ar bacteria appears to be very effective in damaging or even eliminating args as observed with bla ctx m 9 gene 4 conclusions in this work a range of antibiotic resistant s aureus e coli and k pneumoniae were subjected to solar light and solar photo fenton treatment the experimental design was conceived in a way to test structural genetic and phenotypic differences among the strains and how these traits affected the aforementioned treatment methods from the presented results some definite conclusions can be drawn the comparison among structurally different antibiotic resistant bacteria gram positive and gram negative which has often been considered a major difference in disinfection studies gave no significant differences in the disinfection time by solar except for the capsule producing k pneumoniae or solar photo fenton the time necessary for disinfection of susceptible and isogenic resistant strains was quasi identical furthermore multidrug resistant strains did not present notable differences in disinfection when compared with single resistant or susceptible strains the regrowth of arb takes place only if treatment times are very short specifically exposure to light after 3 h halted regrowth and solar photo fenton treatment ensured deterministic decay beyond 30 min even in the absence of residual h2o2 increase of antibiotic resistance was rarely found it occurred only after 3 cycles of treatment oxidative processes are better at ensuring args elimination indeed the solar photo fenton process and its intracellular activity showed very quick destruction of args in esbl e coli overall based on these findings we suggest that arbs do not have to be considered as a special biological contaminant in disinfection kinetics studies if the photo fenton oxidation takes place also if total inactivation is achieved most likely no regrowth will occur and args could be already destroyed these results confer a safety on the disinfection effectiveness if the solar photo fenton process is used in water but surely its generalization should be taken with caution and warrants further investigations

19434,the emergence of antibiotic resistance represents a major threat to human health in this work we investigated the elimination of antibiotic resistant bacteria arb by solar light and solar photo fenton processes as such we have designed an experimental plan in which several bacterial strains staphylococcus aureus escherichia coli and klebsiella pneumoniae possessing different drug susceptible and resistant patterns and structures gram positive and gram negative were subjected to solar light and the photo fenton oxidative treatment in water we showed that both solar light and solar photo fenton processes were effective in the elimination of arb in water and that the time necessary for solar light disinfection and solar photo fenton disinfection were similar for antibiotic susceptible and antibiotic resistant strains mostly 180 240 and 90 120 min respectively moreover the bacterial structure did not significantly affect the effectiveness of the treatment similar regrowth pattern was observed compared to the susceptible strain and no development of bacteria with higher drug resistance values was found in waters after any treatment finally both processes were effective to reduce ar genes args although solar photo fenton was more rapid than solar light in conclusion the solar photo fenton process ensured effective disinfection of arb and elimination of args in water or wastewater and is a potential mean to ensure limitation of arb and arg spread in nature graphical abstract image 1 keywords solar disinfection sodis advanced oxidation process aops water treatment

numerous environments e g hospitals hocquet et al 2016 waters dodd 2012 or crops ferro et al 2015b and are a major threat for human health as an example we can highlight the emergence of ciprofloxacin resistant escherichia coli fasugba et al 2015 and of colistin resistant enterobacteriae poirel et al 2016 ciprofloxacin is the main fluoroquinolone prescribed for urinary tract infections a disease affecting 150 million people per annum worldwide as well as for more severe infections such as septicemia fasugba et al 2015 another example colistin is considered the antibiotic of last resort for the treatment of carbapenem resistant bacteria osei sekyere et al 2016 arb kill approximately 700 000 people worldwide each year and there is currently a lack or shortage of new effective antibiotics in the clinical pipeline willyard 2017 one alternative to decrease the threat posed by arb could be their minimization by the so called advanced oxidation processes in urban wastewater treatment plant effluents before their disposal into the environment michael kordatou et al 2018 sharma et al 2016 these processes have been already employed for the treatment decontamination and disinfection of wastewater a reservoir of arb the aops lead to the generation of reactive oxygen species ros such as hydroxyl radicals ho that inactivate bacteria and other microorganisms such as fungi garcía fernández et al 2012 giannakis et al 2016b viruses giannakis et al 2017a 2017b kim et al 2010 nieto juarez et al 2010 and helminth eggs bandala et al 2012 aops can also degrade contaminants of emerging concern giannakis et al 2015 including antibiotics alongside disinfection giannakis et al 2016c michael kordatou et al 2015 among the conventional and aops used against arb it is worth mentioning chlorination ozonation and photocatalytic processes chlorination is a conventional water disinfection process in reason of its effectiveness and of chlorine availability its ability to totally inactivate ar e coli within 2 5 min of contact in surface water at an initial chlorine concentration of 1 0 mg l was demonstrated miranda et al 2016 nevertheless this disinfection method has some drawbacks related with toxic disinfection byproducts such as total organic halogens zhu and zhang 2016 in addition antibiotic resistant genes args are not removed after wastewater chlorination yuan et al 2015 ozonation is an aop that produces hydroxyl radicals but also undesired disinfection by products von gunten 2003 it is able to disinfect microorganisms but not to control args spread sousa et al 2017 unless combined with photocatalysis moreira et al 2016 photocatalytic processes include for instance the use of tio2 and irradiation it has been shown that methicillin resistant staphylococcus aureus mrsa and other ar bacteria are inactivated using uva tio2 tsai et al 2010 in addition n doped tio2 photocatalysis was found to inactivate ar e coli in treated urban wastewater but without reducing the resistance to antibiotics rizzo et al 2014 solar light alone solar h2o2 and solar photo fenton have also been used to disinfect arb ferro et al 2015a fiorentino et al 2015 giannakis et al 2018b rizzo et al 2013 the solar disinfection process inactivates arb based principally on the uv wavelengths from sunlight uv radiation can damage dna by mutations strand breaks and

killing process fiorentino et al 2015 h2o2 has an oxidative power and can affect the fe s clusters to release iron ions which allowed initiation of internal photo fenton reactions as described elsewhere giannakis 2018 the solar photo fenton process further improved solar disinfection by addition of h2o2 and of fe2 in solution to produce hydroxyl radicals that degrade the external membrane of bacteria increase the permeability induce internal reactions and eventually inactivates the cell giannakis et al 2018a a reduction in the number of different arg has been reported for solar photo fenton karaolia et al 2014 zhang et al 2016 making it an interesting treatment to eliminate the spread of args into the environment despite these reports however there is a lack of systematic studies that account for the recent developments in arbs and for whether or not solar based aops are actually capable of eradicating these bacteria as well as args in this work we have employed a series of s aureus e coli and k pneumoniae ar strains and have researched the capability of solar light and its enhancement by the photo fenton process to efficiently inactivate them to this end we have compared the relative response to solar aops of i structurally different strains ii isogenic susceptible and resistant strains and iii single drug vs multi drug resistant strains including bacteria resistant to last resort drugs also we have assessed the effect of solar based aops on ar and the risk of selection towards resistant strains finally the regrowth of resistant strains after treatment and the elimination of two relevant args were also monitored 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemicals and reagents for the photo fenton process h2o2 30 w w and feso4 7h2o were purchased from sigma aldrich buchs switzerland ceftazdime ciprofloxacin colistin methicillin and rifampicin antibiotics were purchased commercially or from sigma aldrich the media for general cultivation of bacteria such as tryptic soy agar tsa brain heart infusion agar bhia tryptic soy broth tsb mueller hinton broth mhb were ordered from bd becton dickinson and company eysins switzerland as well as the ceftazidime caz 30 μg and ceftazidime plus clavulanic acid caz cla 30 μg 10 μg discs catalase from bovine liver is coming from sigma aldrich for the electrophoresis agarose and 1 kb dna ladder were purchased from promega dübendorf switzerland while sybr safe dna gel stain was purchased from invitrogen basel switzerland 2 2 bacterial strains and growth conditions the bacterial strains used in this study are listed in table 1 and include 10 s aureus 4 e coli and 2 k pneumoniae from different collections or geographical origins bacterial were stored frozen in tsb containing 10 v v glycerol at 80 c and sub cultured on bhia plates to ensure purity before testing all bacterial strains were grown at 37 c in tsb or bhia plates 2 3 solar and solar photo fenton disinfection methods 2 3 1 disinfection processes experiments were performed with a suntest apparatus heraeus hanau germany at an irradiation level of 750 w m2 emitted by a 150 w xenon lamp the emission spectra from the manufacturer is provided in the supplementary fig s1 more details on the illumination source can be found elsewhere giannakis et al 2014 pyrex graduated erlenmeyer flasks with screw cap were used as reactors for each reactor the starting bacterial concentration was 106 cfu ml in 40 ml of ultrapure water reactors were exposed to simulated sunlight illumination and kept under agitation until the end of experiment in the case of solar photo fenton process 10 mg l h2o2 and 1 mg l fe2 from feso4 7h2o were added in the reactor to get a fe2 h2o2 ratio of 1 10 before simulated sunlight exposure the starting ph was 6 5 and remained without changes in solar exposure tests and only slightly decreased in photo fenton processes around 6 1 6 2 thanks to the low iron addition the choice of iron amount is done at a low level close to the limits posed by the who for drinking water 0 6 mg l and h2o2 is semi arbitrarily chosen in an amount high enough to see a change in kinetics but low enough to allow their study and avoid high extracellular oxidation of bacterial cells uhl and dukan 2016 world health organization 2003 at different times during the inactivation process samples 0 1 1 ml see below were taken from the glass reactors during inactivation experiments for colony counts samples 0 1 ml were serially diluted and plated on bhia plates colony counts were performed after incubation of the plates at 37 c for 24 h the results were expressed in cfu ml and normalized to the inoculum at the onset of disinfection 106 cfu ml for the comparison of disinfection kinetics modeling of the inactivation curves took place using the ginafit add on for excel geeraerd et al 2005 and the shoulder log linear decay model was fit to the curves geeraerd et al 2000 the model is as follows 1 n n 0 exp k m a x t exp k m a x s l 1 exp k m a x s l 1 exp k m a x t for identification purposes it can be presented as 2 l o g 10 n l o g 10 n 0 k t t s ln 10 l o g 10 1 exp k t s 1 exp k t the variables of equations 1 and 2 are n the bacterial concentration at time t cfu ml n0 the initial bacterial numbers cfu ml t time s ts or sl is the length of the lag phase period also known as shoulder length k or kmax is the rate i e the maximum slope the last two are the model parameters to be fitted every time 2 3 2 bacterial regrowth experiments for bacterial regrowth experiments the bacterial preparation and experimental conditions were as described above in the context of sodis water is exposed one day and then kept in the house until consumption dark storage so here after the end of the simulated sunlight exposure samples 0 4 ml were taken and kept in the dark at room temperature for 24 h and 48 h samples undergoing solar photo fenton inactivation were conserved in two exemplars one with catalase 100 μl of stock diluted 100 times added directly after sampling and one without catalase addition catalase is the enzyme accelerating the decomposition of h2o2 to h2o and o2 hence the two parallel samples allow the investigation of the damage that took place up to that point or the continuous dark fenton process by the presence of residual oxidants samples were then plated on bhia plates for colony counts as described above 2 4 antibiotic susceptibility minimum inhibitory concentrations mics of antibiotics for the arb were determined by broth micro dilution method in mhb in each test an antibiotic susceptible strain was used as control wells were inoculated with bacterial suspension at a turbidity around 1 2 mcfarland approximately 108 cfu ml after incubation of the plates for 24 h at 37 c the mics were defined as the lowest concentration of antibiotic that yielded no visible growth to define strains as susceptible or resistant breakpoints recommended by the european committee on antimicrobial susceptibility testing eucast were followed eucast 2018 2 5 detection of extended spectrum β lactamase esbl genes the presence of the predominant esbl genes bla ctx m 1 and bla ctx m 9 in the model organism e coli esbl 8543 before and during the disinfection process was monitored by polymerase chain reaction pcr using specific primers table 2 and protocols previously described han et al 2016 for confirmatory esbl production e coli esbl 8543 was subjected to disc diffusion method by placing ceftazidime and ceftazidime clavulanate discs on the inoculated bhia plate at a distance of 25 mm apart plates were incubated overnight at 37 c and the inhibition zone sizes were recorded 3 results and discussion 3 1 comparison of solar and solar photo fenton disinfection for the elimination of structurally different arb strains bacteria have different structure features with the gram type is one of the most distinctive in disinfection studies rodríguez chueca et al 2014 gram positive have a thicker peptidoglycan layer than gram negative bacteria but the later ones have an additional outer membrane surrounding a thin peptidoglycan bolla et al 2011 as depicted in fig 1 we tested the antibiotic resistant strains mrsa atcc 43300 gram positive and e coli esbl 8543 gram negative as well as their antibiotic susceptible homologous s aureus atcc 29213 and e coli atcc 25922 disinfection of antibiotic resistant s aureus and e coli shows a similar trend as the antibiotic susceptible bacteria indicating that neither the distinction by gram type nor the susceptibility trait affects oxidative stress interestingly however s aureus and e coli were totally inactivated by solar photo fenton within 90 min while with solar light the disinfection is completed only after 240 min the antimicrobial efficiency order of the two processes was similar to what has been observed in the literature for other strains of gram positive bacteria such as mdr enterococcus faecalis compared to gram negative mdr e coli ferro et al 2015a fiorentino et al 2015 rubio et al 2013 another example was the inactivation of e faecalis by solar photo fenton with a 1 10 fe ii h2o2 ratio at ph 4 that reached the detection limit after 140 min while it was 180 min by solar alone in distilled water karaolia et al 2014 the inactivation difference in the study by karaloia et al is much less pronounced between those two processes than observed in our study the intracellular oxidative stress on e faecalis is reduced mainly by three enzymes of the peroxidase class la carbona et al 2007 e faecalis however has the possibility to generate catalase in presence of heme baureder et al 2012 finally as a separate mention we would like to highlight the difference in inactivation observed with the k pneumoniae strain 8534 compared to the other gram negative strains klebsiella produces a polysaccharide capsule that prevents cell desiccation allow adherence to surfaces and confer resistance to host immunity system paczosa and mecsas 2016 roberts 1996 the capsule under solar photo fenton stress has no strong influence in inactivation slightly delayed kinetics but solar light was ineffective the effect could be related to the presence of a capsule or as has been recently found serna galvis et al 2018 to the total number of dna bases to be affected in order to cause inactivation by the direct action of solar uv light ravanat et al 2001 as provisional conclusion we observed that the activity of solar photo fenton was independent of the bacterial structure and resistant phenotype the inactivation took place following very similar kinetics with lag phase and log linear k constants of very close values for detailed information interested readers should consult table s1 however the tested strains were not isogenic susceptible resistant and no assertive conclusions can be drawn therefore we further tested the activity of solar and solar photo fenton against isogenic susceptible resistant strains 3 2 solar and solar photo fenton disinfection comparisons against isogenic antibiotic susceptible and antibiotic resistant bacteria the influence of the acquisition of antibiotic resistance on bacterial inactivation was afterwards tested with solar and solar photo fenton against antibiotic susceptible as well as isogenic antibiotic resistant derivatives generated in the laboratory two methicillin susceptible s aureus strains mssa 1112 and mssa 133 and their isogenic rifampicin resistant strains mssa 1112 rifr and ciprofloxacin resistant mssa 1112 cipr and mssa 133 cip r mutants were used in addition the vancomycin susceptible mrsa pc1 and its vancomycin intermediate resistant derivative visa pc 3 sieradzki et al 1999 were also used as shown in fig 2 a and b the solar and solar photo fenton disinfection process showed similar inactivation profiles regardless of whether the bacteria are susceptible or resistant but with different disinfection times while s aureus are completely inactivated by solar photo fenton after approximately 90 of treatment the inactivation takes 180 min in the case of solar exposure the same tendency was observed with mrsa pc 1 and its derived visa pc 3 fig 2c these results with isogeneic pairs of susceptible resistant strains confirm that no general correlation exists between antibiotic resistance acquisition and increased resistance to solar light or solar photo fenton aop and that bacterial inactivation following solar photo fenton exposure is more rapid that after exposure to solar light alone also the neighboring kinetic model parameters of both solar and solar photo fenton disinfection confirm the similarity in the inactivation of both strains without differentiation according to the resistance table s1 3 3 inactivation of bacteria resistant to multiple antibiotics in previous experiments the activity of solar and solar photo fenton was performed on bacteria either susceptible or resistant to one single antibiotic however bacteria are often resistant to multiple antibiotics in order to assess whether multidrug resistant bacteria are more difficult to eliminate by solar and solar photo fenton than single drug resistant ones we tested a multidrug resistant mdr strain of s aureus mrsa aw25 as well as a multidrug resistant e coli strain s115 strain mrsa aw25 is resistant to methicillin rifampin and ciprofloxacin strain e coli s115 is a colistin and carbapenem resistant isolate poirel et al 2016 the isogenic strains mssa atcc 2913 and e coli atcc 25922 were used as antibiotic susceptible reference control strains to the aforementioned mdr ones as shown in fig 3 a we observed that mrsa aw25 was totally inactivated after 240 min by solar treatment and after 90 min by solar photo fenton exposure results which are in agreement with the previously determined disinfection time for s aureus strains figs 1 and 2 however the initial rate of inactivation after solar exposure is somewhat slower than for other s aureus studied so far table s1 indicates the aforementioned differences and the vicinity of the values in general also according to previous results with single drug resistant s aureus figs 1 and 2 the mechanism of resistance to either methicillin rifampin or ciprofloxacin alone can probably be excluded as the reason of increased solar resistance in order to be completely adamant for the lack of resistance to treatment some other tests with other resistances present in s aureus aw25 e g gentamicin and tetracycline should be done to determine the cause of slower initial killing of this strain by solar disinfection the colistin resistant e coli s115 fig 3c was completely inactivated by solar photo fenton within approximately 90 min similarly to e coli esbl 8543 and the susceptible strain atcc 25922 while it was not totally inactivated after 240 min of solar treatment 4 log decrease of the initial inoculum solar treatment totally inactivates at 240 min both the susceptible and esbl producing e coli strains in summary bacteria possessing resistance to multiple antibiotics including commonly used antibiotics as well antibiotics of last resort do not seem to have an enhanced resistance neither to solar nor towards solar photo fenton treatment the solar photo fenton process is again very effective and more rapid than solar treatment to decrease the bacterial population of multidrug resistant strains with total inactivation occurring within around 90 min for all those bacteria 3 4 bacterial regrowth after disinfection by solar and solar photo fenton processes the previous sections revealed that no significant changes were observed in the inactivation kinetics among antibiotic susceptible and antibiotic resistant bacteria in order to assess if there was a difference in the survival and regrowth response of these bacteria in solar and solar photo fenton treatment we have assessed the survival of a streptomycin resistant strain e coli w1485 by a method previously described giannakis et al 2018b michael et al 2012 as depicted in fig 4 a regrowth after solar treatment was manifested up to 3 h of exposure further treatment led to definite loss of viability within 24 or 48 h more importantly the total bacteria and the resistant fraction presented similar tendencies with minor differences this trend was also found after the solar photo fenton process fig 4b although no regrowth took place in presence of residual h2o2 that remained after treatment consequently although in different conditions from the rest of our tests that have a lack of nutrients in the matrix and lower h2o2 content for the photo fenton for the following strains and their regrowth potential we tested only the resistant strains and not their susceptible counterparts also elimination of h2o2 took also place in parallel test to assess the degree of cell injuries after treatment without the effect of the residual oxidative action the regrowth of two different antibiotic resistant bacteria e coli esbl 8543 and mrsa atcc 43300 were further examined during 2 days after solar and solar photo fenton treatment leading to partial or total disinfection fig 5 in solar photo fenton regrowth experiments two different storage conditions were tested with or without catalase addition to the samples in order to assess the effect of residual h2o2 in solution the samples were kept in water at room temperature without nutrients addition after solar treatment e coli esbl 8543 and mrsa atcc 43300 were totally inactivated after 300 and 240 min respectively fig 5a and d regrowth was observed after 2 days for samples taken at 60 and 120 min of exposure for e coli and after 60 min for mrsa while kinetics seem stable or with a small decrease for samples taken at 180 and 240 min for e coli or after 120 min for mrsa overall the ability to regrow was seen in early times when the inactivation process induced limited cell damages after a given time damages are likely too important and hindered the capacity of bacteria to multiply and a decrease of population is observed despite survival to the disinfection valero et al 2017 with regard to the solar photo fenton process total inactivation of both e coli and mrsa was achieved after 90 min of exposure fig 5b and e no regrowth was observed at any time after treatment even after a short disinfection time when solar photo fenton activity was tested in the presence of catalase the bacterial population remained stable for e coli fig 5c or increases slightly for mrsa fig 5f on day 1 and 2 after short exposition time less than 60 min most likely due to h2o2 removal contrarily to the experiments without catalase addition fig 5b and e after 60 min the bacterial count of both strains progressively decrease until reaching the detection limit on day 2 taken together the regrowth kinetics of e coli esbl 8543 and mrsa 43300 fig 5 and that of the streptomycin resistant e coli w1485 fig 4 suggest that the changes produced in the bacterial cells by the solar and oxidative treatment were irreversible and did not allow bacteria to recover 3 5 modification of antibiotic resistance during solar and solar photo fenton treatment and elimination of args 3 5 1 modification of mic during solar and solar photo fenton treatment the mic was used to determine whether or not bacteria were still resistant to their corresponding antibiotic after solar and solar photo fenton treatments the mics were determined for several strains with colonies isolated from agar plates at different time points of treatment 0 240 min only colonies from plates that had a considerable number of survivors were used the susceptible strain atcc 29213 was used as control and the eucast mic breakpoints to define susceptibility of resistance were followed the results of mic variations are summarized in table 3 the detailed results of the mic tests are provided in supplementary material table s2 the control strain atcc 29213 remained susceptible to the tested drugs as expected we observed that the resistance towards methicillin of mrsa atcc 43300 treated with solar or solar photo fenton remained unchanged with mics above the resistance breakpoint 2 μg ml and similar to those before exposure 8 32 μg ml these mics results indicate that mrsa strains do not lose their methicillin resistance during the treatment processes at any time point of exposure for this strain some variability of the methicillin mic value at certain time points was observed the fact that the resistance to methicillin is not homogeneous explains this variability mics of ciprofloxacin and rifampicin were performed as well on strain mrsa aw25 this strain kept its antibiotic resistance throughout solar and solar photo fenton processes with mics of 16 μg ml similar to those at the onset of therapy and well above the resistance breakpoints 1 and 0 5 μg ml respectively it has been shown that uv treatment was able to affect the ciprofloxacin resistance of mdr e coli while chlorination was not rizzo et al 2013 this suggests that uv exposure might be more effective than solar photo fenton to remove the antibiotic resistance determinant of antibiotics that damage the dna with regard to esbl producing bacteria these strains are able to degrade ceftazidime a β lactam antibiotic and become resistant to it esbl producing e coli and k pneumoniae were used to determine ceftazidime mic variation during solar and solar photo fenton exposure the ceftazidime susceptible e coli atcc 25922 and k pneumoniae atcc 27736 isolates were used as controls and were susceptible to the drug as expected some variability in the mic of ceftazidime with values going from 16 to 64 μg ml for e coli esbl 8543 and from 8 to 32 μg ml for k pneumoniae esbl 8534 were observed during both solar and solar photo fenton treatment the samples taken towards the end 60 min of each treatment for both e coli esbl 8543 and k pneumoniae 8534 showed 2 4 times decreased mics compared to the start of solar 64 and 16 μg ml respectively or solar photo fenton 64 and 32 μg ml respectively exposure however this diminution corresponds to only one or two fold dilutions which is not enough to assert that the effect is really due to the treatment since the variability of the mic method can fluctuate between two dilutions those mic values anyway are still above the ceftazidime resistant breakpoint 4 μg ml the persistence of esbl resistance after aop treatment was confirmed by the disk diffusion test on agar plates using discs containing ceftazidime or ceftazidime plus clavulanic acid which inhibits esbl production and e coli esbl 8543 and k pneumoniae esbl 8534 as tests organisms we observed that after solar photo fenton exposure the inhibition zone around the disc containing ceftazidime plus clavulanic acid is larger than the inhibition zone around the disc containing ceftazidime alone indicating that esbl is still produced see fig s2 of the supplementary material it has also been demonstrated that mdr e coli kept its resistances to ampicillin ciprofloxacin tetracycline and vancomycin after h2o2 sunlight treatment fiorentino et al 2015 this result was also seen with multiple resistances of mdr e coli after sodis h2o2 sunlight photo fenton tio2 sunlight and tio2 h2o2 sunlight treatments ferro et al 2015a finally we tested the evolution of colistin resistance using the colistin resistant strain e coli 5115 the colistin susceptible e coli atcc 25922 was used as control mic values of colistin for e coli 5115 during both aops exposure were generally 2 μg ml similar to the initial mic except for the solar disinfection at 120 min 1 μg ml nonetheless the latter value is only one dilution away from other determined mics and at 180 min of treatment it went back to the original mic all those values are considered as colistin resistant according to eucast breakpoint 2 μg ml and the large difference with the mic for the susceptible control 0 125 μg ml thus resistance to colistin also persisted during aop treatment in overall the mic tests performed on several bacterial strains for various antibiotics suggest that one single treatment by aops was not able to remove the antibiotic resistance trait of surviving bacteria during the treatment 3 5 2 mic modification after prolongation of treatment 3 repetitive photo fenton cycles since antibiotic resistance generally remained unchanged during a single run of bacterial inactivation test we performed repetitive solar photo fenton treatment in order to analyze whether bacterial resistance could be more affected by repetition of the treatment to this end survivors of the same bacteria tested above and recovered on agar plates after the first cycle of exposure were grown again and re inactivated in the same conditions for 2 more cycles fig 6 mics after a single treatment were then compared to mics after 3 treatments as shown in table 4 after 3 cycles of treatment the mics values of methicillin ciprofloxacin and rifampin for mrsa the mic values of ceftazidime against esbl isolates and the mic value of colistin for the colistin resistant strain s115 were still above the resistant breakpoints as after a single treatment thus the arb conserved their resistant phenotype after multiple aop exposure in the case of mrsa atcc 433300 the mic of methicillin decreased 4 times compared to the mic after a single exposure in the case of e coli esbl 8543 for ceftazidime and of e coli s115 for colisitn the mics after 3 cycles increased 4 times as compared to one single treatment it is possible that stress caused by multiple treatments could modify the outer membrane of the bacteria decreasing the penetration of ceftazidime or reducing the affinity of colistin for its target the lipid a for instance with a loss of its negative charge wand et al 2015 overall these results suggest that the repetition of exposure to aops is not effective in suppressing the antibiotic resistance all mic values are above the resistant breakpoints and that even can push towards more resistant strains 3 6 args degradation by solar and solar photo fenton monitoring by pcr since aops and particularly the solar photo fenton process are able to eliminate every arb tested but their resistance remains even after repeated treatment this suggests that aops are not able to affect their args so the question arises as to whether the genes responsible for antibiotic resistance can be found in the lysate after bacterial inactivation and potentially be acquired by other cells by transformation in order to assess the fate of the antibiotic resistance genes args during and after aop treatment pcr was used to amplify genes responsible for esbl production in e coli esbl 8543 as a representative strain esbl producing bacteria resist to β lactam antibiotics by the production of different types of β lactamases coded by bla genes the most prevalent esbl genes in many countries are bla ctx m 1 and bla ctx m 9 elhassan et al 2016 overdevest et al 2011 therefore the presence of these two genes was tested in e coli esbl 8543 no amplification was observed for the bla ctx m 1 gene fig 7 a only bla ctx m 9 was present in e coli esbl 8543 with a band observed between 750 and 1000 bp which corresponds to the size of the amplified bla ctx m 9 gene 868 bp in order to investigate the degradation of bla ctx m 9 during the disinfection we performed pcr with samples taken at different times during both solar and solar photo fenton treatment the gene bla ctx m 9 was present in e coli esbl 8543 all along the solar disinfection fig 7b the intensity of the signal however decreased with treatment time suggesting an effect of the solar exposure on the gene since the gene was not totally degraded in the lysate this suggests that its spread is possible after the death of the bacteria the bla ctx m 9 gene was also present in the sample taken before the solar photo fenton treatment lane 10 but any amplification was observed after 15 min of exposure whether the absence of amplification from 15 min onwards was due to a fast elimination of the bla ctx m 9 gene by solar photo fenton should be confirmed with other esbl producing bacteria like k pneumoniae several examples of the fate of args during relevant aops have been described for instance the intracellular concentration of bla tem gene another gene responsible for esbl production decreased during mdr e coli uv h2o2 disinfection ferro et al 2016 however this decrease was not caused by the disinfection process but by the reduced number of surviving bacteria to extract dna during the process the study by ferro et al also showed that the uv h2o2 process was unable to remove other args indeed bla tem qnrs quinolone resistance and tetw tetracycline resistance were still detected after 240 min of treatment the repeated experiment gave the same result after 300 min of treatment with bla tem at the same concentration as before the disinfection ferro et al 2017 this comes as small surprise considering that the action of the generated ho is prevalently external on the contrary our applied solar photo fenton process was proven to be an intracellular process giannakis et al 2018a another study showed using qpcr a reduction in wastewater by fenton and uv h2o2 processes of sul1 tetx tetg and intl1 genes but the removal was partial zhang et al 2016 in our work the tests of arb elimination with solar disinfection suggest that the risk of ar spread after such treatment cannot be overlooked due to remnant args in solution after bacterial inactivation maybe only if the exposure is prolonged enough this risk could be negligible on the other hand solar photo fenton treatment of ar bacteria appears to be very effective in damaging or even eliminating args as observed with bla ctx m 9 gene 4 conclusions in this work a range of antibiotic resistant s aureus e coli and k pneumoniae were subjected to solar light and solar photo fenton treatment the experimental design was conceived in a way to test structural genetic and phenotypic differences among the strains and how these traits affected the aforementioned treatment methods from the presented results some definite conclusions can be drawn the comparison among structurally different antibiotic resistant bacteria gram positive and gram negative which has often been considered a major difference in disinfection studies gave no significant differences in the disinfection time by solar except for the capsule producing k pneumoniae or solar photo fenton the time necessary for disinfection of susceptible and isogenic resistant strains was quasi identical furthermore multidrug resistant strains did not present notable differences in disinfection when compared with single resistant or susceptible strains the regrowth of arb takes place only if treatment times are very short specifically exposure to light after 3 h halted regrowth and solar photo fenton treatment ensured deterministic decay beyond 30 min even in the absence of residual h2o2 increase of antibiotic resistance was rarely found it occurred only after 3 cycles of treatment oxidative processes are better at ensuring args elimination indeed the solar photo fenton process and its intracellular activity showed very quick destruction of args in esbl e coli overall based on these findings we suggest that arbs do not have to be considered as a special biological contaminant in disinfection kinetics studies if the photo fenton oxidation takes place also if total inactivation is achieved most likely no regrowth will occur and args could be already destroyed these results confer a safety on the disinfection effectiveness if the solar photo fenton process is used in water but surely its generalization should be taken with caution and warrants further investigations
