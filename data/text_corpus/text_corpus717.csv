3585,fractures have a governing effect on the physical properties of fractured rocks such as permeability accurate representation of 3d fractures is therefore required for precise analysis of digital fractured rocks however conventional segmentation methods fail to detect and label the fractures with aperture sizes near or below the resolution of 3d micro computed tomographic micro ct images which are visible in the greyscale images and where greyscale intensity convolution between different phases exists in addition conventional methods are highly subjective to user interpretation herein a novel algorithm for the automatic detection of fractures from greyscale 3d micro ct images is proposed the algorithm involves a low level early vision stage which identifies potential fractures followed by a high level interpretative stage which enforces planar continuity to reject false positives and more reliably extract planar fractures from digital rock images a manually segmented fractured shale sample was used as the groundtruth with which the efficacy of the algorithm in 3d fracture detection was validated following this the proposed and conventional methods were applied to detect fractures in digital fractured coal and shale samples based on these analyses the impact of fracture detection accuracy on the analysis of fractured rocks physical properties was inferred keywords fracture detection micro ct image computer vision fractured media 1 introduction fracture networks in rocks are generally complex they can range from micro scale fractures in rock cores of a few cubic millimetres to mega scale fractures and faults of a few thousand kilometres in the earth crust accurate characterisation of the fracture network is important in many disciplines such as water petroleum mining and civil engineering fractures particularly conductive fractures can greatly impact the physical properties of any rocktype in terms of fluid flow well connected fractures enhance the permeability of the rocks significantly especially for tight rocktypes a range of techniques have been developed to characterise and visualise fracture networks at core scale such as optical microscopy serati et al 2021 zhang et al 1999 scanning electron microscopy sem fonseka et al 1985 lindqvist et al 1984 ramandi et al 2016a zhou et al 2016 neutron tomography christe et al 2007 siddiqui et al 2021 and x ray micro computed tomography micro ct arshadi et al 2017 gomila et al 2021 lv et al 2019 qi et al 2018 ramandi et al 2015 ramandi et al 2017 roshan et al 2019 permeability of the fractured rocks with low matrix permeability is primarily controlled by dimensions spacing connectivity and mineralisation level of the fractures ramandi et al 2016b zhao et al 2021 measuring aperture attributes locally and taking into account their variations are highly complex tasks therefore for fluid flow analysis fractures have traditionally been simplified as a set of parallel plates and the cubic law is applied to simulate the flow al raoush and papadopoulos 2010 karpyn et al 2007 however it is now well established that the fractures are rough walled channels significantly influencing the flow regimes al raoush and papadopoulos 2010 li et al 2020 pruess and tsang 1990 wang et al 2021 among different imaging techniques the micro ct technique possesses the advantage of the provision of high fidelity high resolution non destructive 3d images suitable for numerical simulations the technique can capture geometrically complex natural fractures however to characterise the fractured rock attributes quantitatively the greyscale multiphase micro ct images need to be segmented into different unique phases that are homogeneous with respect to some characteristic the number of labels phases depends on the purpose of the study and the available micro ct image data and its quality for flow simulation a two phase digital rock where void space and solid phases are labelled is usually required however three phase digital rocks including resolved void spaces solid phase and sub resolution void spaces voxels that are partially filled with void spaces are also used for flow simulation which account for the influence of micro voids on permeability qajar et al 2012 soulaine et al 2016 hybrid and dual domain models where a resolved phase generally a high permeability phase and sub resolution phase generally a relatively low permeability phase are uniquely labelled are also employed to compute the transport properties of digital porous media soulaine et al 2016 yang et al 2019 segmentation is therefore the most crucial step in image processing that will have a profound impact on all subsequent image analyses and simulations iassonov et al 2009 schlüter et al 2014 several free and commercial software toolboxes have been developed with some form of image processing analysis and visualisation capabilities such as imagej schneider et al 2012 itk ibanez et al 2005 blob3d ketcham 2005 scikit image van der walt et al 2014 scanip segment 3dviewnix and amira avizo the number of segmentation methods in the literature exceeds a hundred iassonov et al 2009 and a small fraction of those are specifically targeted fractured media however no segmentation method excels at all segmentation tasks and performs an errorless segmentation several classification schemes have been proposed in the literature for image segmentation with a number of methods included in more than one class iassonov et al 2009 global thresholding methods include approaches where voxels are classified based on greyscale histogram evaluation only without considering how the greyscale values are spatially arranged in corresponding images schlüter et al 2014 sezgin and sankur 2004 stathis et al 2008 in contrast locally adaptive segmentation methods include those making a segmentation decision for each voxel using neighbourhood statistics it is known that in general employing local information can provide relatively satisfying segmentation results deng et al 2016 schlüter et al 2014 stathis et al 2008 a comprehensive survey by schlüter et al 2014 discussed a number of well known segmentation methods and showed that the converging active contours cac method is well suited for multiphase segmentation of micro ct images cac uses local gradient and intensity greyscale value information at the same time sheppard et al 2004 its major drawback lies in its sensitivity to seed region detection and the adjustment of parameters for the speed function iassonov et al 2009 cac techniques also cannot extract all the fractures in the fractured 3d images ramandi et al 2017 ramandi et al 2018 furthermore almost all segmentation methods need some inputs from the user making the segmentation processes a subjective task different segmentation results are thus obtained from users with different levels of expertise which makes the comparison of different data and results challenging and erroneous several approaches based on the deep learning technique have been recently proposed asadi and beckingham 2021 cheng and guo 2017 karimpouli et al 2020b li et al 2019 wang et al 2019 however a major issue when adopting such methods is that they require large training datasets comprising of a large number of correctly segmented images but such datasets are not widely available additionally a deep learning system trained on a dataset is generally only accurate for the same specific rock sample from which the training data is obtained therefore the subjectivity of segmentation remains a significant challenge the presence of discontinuities such as ridges valleys and fractures in images all correspond to high levels of change of the imagery data within a confined local spatial region for this reason first and second order gradient information is often used in feature detection tasks prior works eberly et al 1994 lopez et al 1999 have utilised second order information in the form of eigenvectors and eigenvalues of the hessian matrix along with first order local gradient calculations of the image data to identify local maxima ridges and minima valleys in the direction of main principal curvature such approaches are successful in detecting curves or skeletons corresponding to ridges and valleys in images but are not designed to detect and segment fractures of varying width the method proposed in this paper also employs the hessian matrix to determine local curvature characteristics however this information is used to identify a volumetric region of high curvature as opposed to a curve of local maxima minima points in general eigenvalue decomposition of the hessian matrix has been deployed for feature detection in a range of applications from medical fornaro et al 2010 frangi et al 1998 to geoscience liang 2016 imaging its utility arises from the fact that eigenvalues of the matrix correspond to local contrast changes along the principal directions of curvature as defined by the eigenvectors as an extension to this approach voorn et al 2013 investigated deploying the hessian matrix at multiple scales to identify fractures in 3d images this work is closely related to the method proposed in this study with the multiscale approach suited to extracting fractures with a range of apertures from image datasets important differences between the two approaches relate to the way in which eigenvalue information is utilised to identify potential fracture regions the proposed approach avoids the normalisation and calibration steps applied to eigenvalues at each voxel and substantially reduces the input parameters that are required for the hessian filtering stage as explained in later sections the proposed approach directly compares the largest eigenvalue at each location with a contrast threshold that is determined from input image statistics and multiscale hessian filter characteristics thereby eliminating any need for specific user defined parameters furthermore complementing the high pass hessian analysis the proposed method implements a directional low pass filtering stage to address issues caused by noise and problematic small high contrast structures that are often accentuated by high pass hessian filtering at the finest scale currently the orientation information provided by the eigenvectors of the hessian matrix is not used and remains a topic of interest for future work the orientation of the gaussian disc is calculated independently from the hessian matrix allowing both processing stages to remain separate and thereby complementary to each other in this study we thus present fracdetect a novel algorithm for detecting fractures from greyscale 3d micro ct that combines the advantages of voxel level fracture detection similar to global thresholding methods with the accuracy of locally adaptive segmentation methods in a two stage framework specifically in the first stage of the proposed algorithm individual voxels in the 3d micro ct image that could correspond to fractures are identified based on two principles a along the direction perpendicular to a fracture two sharp changes in voxel intensity can be expected corresponding to the edges of the fracture and b a fracture is locally planar and has a much shorter extent along one direction compared to the other two orthogonal directions this is followed by a second stage which imposes the constraint that voxels corresponding to a fracture must be connected to other such voxels and cannot be isolated the proposed algorithm is also developed with a view of minimising the number of the threshold values that will need to be manually tuned with the most relevant thresholds in the algorithm automatically inferred from the 3d image data the algorithm s performance is assessed by comparing its output with a manually segmented fractured shale sample additionally the algorithm is employed on fractured shale and coal samples and the results are compared with those obtained from conventional segmentation methods 2 material and methods 2 1 digital rock data acquisition a shale and a coal sample were used in this study as two cases of low permeability rocks containing fractures the shale sample was an organic rich shale obtained from the middle velkerri formation beetaloo sub basin the state of northern territory australia details on the petrophysical properties of the shale can be found in algazlan et al 2019 the sample contained 3 15 wt organic carbon and major clay minerals were illite muscovite 15 7 wt and illite smectite 7 4 wt the coal sample was sub bituminous coal from the baralaba coal measures on the south eastern flank of the bowen basin the state of queensland australia details on the coal specifications including petrophysical properties and proximate and ultimate analyses results are given in ramandi et al 2016b micro ct imaging of the samples was conducted using a helical micro ct scanner sheppard et al 2014 the helical scanner uses a double helix scanning trajectory varslot et al 2012 to acquire data that facilitate efficient utilisation of the available x ray flux sheppard et al 2014 the scanner acquires a series of projections from the sample at different viewing angles the projections characterise the cumulative attenuation of the x ray beam through the sample the acquired projections are then entered into a reconstruction algorithm based on katsevich 2002 to reconstruct a 3d image tomogram the tomograms are usually presented in 16 bit greyscale images where each data point characterises the effective x ray attenuation coefficient of the sample at that specific point more details on the helical scanner and its specifications can be found in sheppard et al 2014 and ramandi et al 2016a the imaged volume of the shale sample was a cylindrical core with a diameter of about 13 mm and a length of about 20 mm with a resolution of 13 6 µm the coal image had a diameter of about 25 mm and a length of about 35 mm with a resolution of about 16 5 µm 2 2 proposed algorithm a novel two stage algorithm which includes a low level early vision stage and a high level interpretative stage is proposed for fracture detection the low level stage which is referred to as a fracture map here generates an initial estimate of whether a fracture exists at each location in the 3d digital rock following this the high level stage imposes reasonable constraints that fractures are not small isolated regions for the low level stage two separate filtering steps that complement each other are used one employs the hessian matrix while the other utilises an oriented gaussian disc a block diagram of the proposed algorithm is shown in fig 1 the hessian matrix provides high pass frequency information pertaining to rapid changes in image data while this stage is important to detecting fractures the presence of noise and small isolated structures can be problematic especially at the finer scales of the multiscale approach to address these issues a complementary oriented gaussian filtering stage is also implemented providing adaptive low pass information that is used with a conservative threshold to reduce falsely detected fracture regions from the high pass hessian filtering stage to remain sensitive to small structures such as high intensity blobs in the image data the standard deviation of the oriented gaussian disc filter is chosen to be 1 in all test cases the applied diameter of the disc filter is also chosen to be small refer to table 1 to match the local planar geometry of fractures to provide more insight into the operation of each stage and to highlight the complementary nature of the two filtering steps fig 2 is presented to show the output of each processing stage for two different input image samples in fig 2 a a potential problematic region in the input slice comprised of white blobs with sharp edges is highlighted red dashed line rectangle the corresponding output of each of the two filtering stages is shown by the accompanying binary images on the top row where black corresponds to potential fracture regions and white refers to the absence of any fracture features the multiscale hessian filter incorrectly classifies parts of the problematic region as potential fractures e g edges of the white blobs while the oriented gaussian filter is able to correctly discard these regions in the alternative example in fig 2 d the problematic region is caused by a slow varying grey area red dashed line oval while this region is correctly classified by the multiscale hessian filter it is falsely identified as a fracture by the oriented gaussian filter in both cases combining the output of the two filtering stages produces a more reliable and faithful segmentation result the final segmented output produced by the proposed algorithm along with corresponding groundtruth for the two input samples are shown in fig 3 the segmented results in the top and bottom rows of fig 3 correspond to the respective input samples shown in the top and bottom rows of fig 2 2 2 1 the hessian matrix for fracture detection in the proposed method the second derivative of gaussian shown in fig 4 serves as a template for fracture matching in typical greyscale tomograms low x ray attenuating materials e g air are presented by low greyscale values as such an empty fracture which is filled with the air appears darker than its adjacent regions in the tomograms filtering with the template thus produces positive responses in locations where fractures exist locally the width of the template can be adjusted by modifying the standard deviation σ of the gaussian in this work a set of standard deviations σ is employed to accommodate a range of possible fracture widths template matching can be efficiently implemented as a convolution with a mirror image of the template but since the second derivative is symmetric mirroring is redundant here the 3d digital rock is denoted as v s where s t s x s y s z is a location within that image then 1 v xx σ s 2 g σ s x 2 v s g σ 2 v s x 2 s 2 s x 2 v g σ s where g σ s e x p s t s 2 σ 2 2 π σ 2 3 2 is the gaussian function and is the convolution operator consequently one can think of the convolution with the second derivative as being equivalent to first convolving the rock image v with a gaussian g σ and then taking the second derivative noting that the second derivative is very sensitive to noise this convolution with a gaussian reduces the noise in the digital rock v and makes the result reliable since fractures can occur in any orientation it is useful to evaluate the second derivate in any direction denoted by the direction vector d with d 2 1 this can be achieved by utilising d t h σ d where h σ is the hessian matrix of the rock image v which is given by 2 h σ s v xx σ s v yx σ s v zx σ s v xy σ s v yy σ s v zy σ s v xz σ s v yz σ s v zz σ s s r 3 where the elements of the hessian are given by second order partial derivatives of the 3d rock image i e v xy σ s 2 g σ s x s y v s in practice however acquiring the digital rock involves sampling the 3d image v s to obtain a discrete image v n where n z 3 consequently the second derivative of gaussian v xy σ n obtained from v 2 g σ s x s y n is valid so long as the nyquist sampling theorem is observed σ must be around 1 or larger so that nyquist theorem is observed for the gaussian as well for the discrete domain oriented second derivative of gaussian it is also well established that it can be obtained as a linear combination of a set of 6 basis discrete domain second derivatives which are in this work the 6 unique partial derivatives in the hessian matrix derpanis and gryn 2005 freeman and adelson 1991 this is only valid for the second derivative of gaussian since the hessian matrix is symmetric it has only real eigenvalues and its eigenvectors are orthogonal the largest magnitude eigenvalue λ m a x σ is equal to the largest magnitude second derivative and the normalised eigenvector associated with λ m a x σ is the direction d m a x σ at which this derivative is obtained this can be obtained from the eigenvalue definition h σ d m a x σ λ m a x d m a x σ multiplying by d m a x σ t which lead to 3 d m a x σ t h m a x σ d max σ d m a x σ t λ m a x σ d m a x σ λ m a x σ normalising or scaling the eigenvector has no effect on the eigenvalue λ m a x σ since c h σ d m a x σ c λ m a x σ d m a x σ where c is a scaling factor also the sign of eigenvalues does not change when the scaling factor c is negative negative eigenvalues are of no interest since they are associated with anti template where the rock image has a bright region between two darker regions in the vicinity of a fracture it is expected the direction d m a x σ to be perpendicular to the fracture plane and the two eigenvalues other than the largest λ m a x σ to be significantly smaller than λ m a x σ a set of standard deviations σ is employed in this work where 1 2 6 larger standard deviations can be employed for wider fractures then for each standard deviation σ a binary image a σ is evaluated using 4 a σ n 1 λ m a x σ n τ a σ 0 o t h e r w i s e where τ a σ is a threshold to evaluate this threshold a contrast value ρ is found from the difference between the mean of the digital rock v n and the mean of the smallest 3 values in v n then the threshold τ a σ is set equal to ρ v 3 d b where v 3 d b is chosen such that the width of the fracture is the distance from the point at which the response to the second derivative of gaussian filter is half its peak to the corresponding point on the other side of the centre of the fracture specifically fractures are detected by comparing regions of the rock image to the second derivative of gaussian template and the response to this filter would attain a local peak when the template is centred on the fracture here edges are defined as the points on either side where the response is 3 db below the peak this way the threshold adapts to the rock image v n the generated binary image a σ represents locations that are likely to have a fracture finally the second derivative of gaussian analysis produces 5 a n max σ σ a σ n 2 2 2 oriented gaussian disc as noted fracture regions correspond to lower image intensity greyscale values i e darker regions than their neighbours a local averaging filter is therefore applied and this local average is compared to a global threshold determined from the statistics of the input sample thus no user supplied information is required the idea here is to evaluate the average over an oriented gaussian disc noting that the desired minimum filter response will always be observed when the orientation of the gaussian disc aligns with that of the fracture as the orientation of the fracture is unknown one approach is to apply incrementally rotated versions of gaussian disc and choose the minimum filter response as the one that best aligns with the fracture orientation such an approach is computationally expensive a more efficient implementation can be achieved by performing operations in the fourier domain as explained next first the rock image v s is multiplied by a gaussian function g t σ s g σ s t centred at location t to obtain a ball 6 f t σ s v s g t σ s in this system gaussian functions with a standard deviation of one are taken only therefore the superscript σ is dropped from all terms in this section for ease of reading by taking the fourier transform f ω of that ball the fourier transform of a series of discs d t y z s x perpendicular to the x axis can be written as 7 f t ω x 0 0 f t s d s y d s z d t y z s x e j ω x s x d s x the desired oriented gaussian disc in the yz plane at location t x 0 is then obtained using the inverse fourier transform of f t ω x 0 0 i e 8 d t y z 0 1 2 π f t ω x 0 0 d ω x discs in other orientations can similarly be obtained by integrating the fourier transformed function f ω in a direction perpendicular to the plane of the disc in this work experimental results have shown that it is sufficient to evaluate only three such discs d xy n d yz n and d xz n the minimum of this disc d m i n n min d xy n d yz n d xz n is then computed as this would correspond to the most likely orientation of the fracture that might exist at that location similar to section 0 binary image b n is evaluated using 9 b n 1 d m i n n τ b 0 o t h e r w i s e where τ b is a threshold obtained from 10 τ b β n n min d m i n n μ v where n is the number of voxels in the digital rock v n μ v is the mean of v n and β is a user defined ratio typically in the range of 0 7 to 0 9 a final candidate fracture map c n is obtained using a n b n 2 2 3 high level interpretation the hessian and oriented gaussian filtering stages provide local low level features summarised in the form of a binary map it is important to note that both filtering stages remain agnostic to any high level information such as expected fracture length and volume the high level analysis stage shown in fig 1 considers the individual binary voxels over a wide spatial span and measures attributes of connected components such as major axis length and volume these measured attributes are then compared to expected values to decide if observed connected components are representative of fractures the high level analysis is performed on the candidate fracture map c n fracture regions as noted before are typically not small isolated regions but form part of a larger spatially connected set of voxels in disc form 3d connectivity analysis he et al 2017 toriwaki and yoshida 2009 is therefore employed to remove small connected regions potentially caused by noise while retaining 3d regions that exceed certain minimum limits more specifically connectivity analysis is performed on the binary candidate fracture map c n identifying sets s i comprised of maximal spatially connected candidate voxels a 6 neighbour 3d connectivity criteria is used such that voxels at locations n 1 and n 2 are considered to be directly connected if c n 1 c n 2 1 and n 2 n 1 2 1 the two attributes of major axis length and volume of a connected component s i can be best described in terms of its corresponding raw moments m pqr i and normalised central moments μ pqr i gonzalez and woods 2018 as defined below 11 m pqr i n s i n x p n y q n z r 12 μ pqr i 1 m 000 i n s i n x n x p n y n y q n z n z r where n n x n y n z and n x n y n z m 100 i m 000 i m 010 i m 000 i m 001 i m 000 i refers to the centroid of the region s i to determine the major axis length attribute l i an ellipsoid centred at n x n y n z is constructed such that the spatial region e i bounded by the ellipsoid corresponds to the same second order normalised central moments as s i chaumette 2004 rocha et al 2002 that is moments μ pqr i for p q r 2 remain the same when eq 11 and 12 are redefined for n e i the major axis length l i is the largest diameter of this constructed ellipsoid modelling s i in this work l i is compared to a threshold l and if l i l then the corresponding set is eliminated as a potential fracture candidate the volume attribute υ i m 000 i is essentially the number of voxels comprising s i and is similarly compared to a corresponding threshold value y if υ i y then s i is omitted as a candidate the lower limit threshold values of l and y are based on observations of collections of both coal and shale samples with available groundtruth data and remain fixed for all test cases considered in this study the value for l is derived as a fixed ratio λ of the minimum dimension of the input rock sample such that 13 l λ m i n d i m x d i m y d i m z where di m x d i m y d i m z represent the width height and depth of the test sample the volume threshold y is derived from average lower limits observed from groundtruth data and also remains unaltered in all experiments without any need for user input both l and y are subject to imaging system parameters including the achieved image resolution and the scale at which fractures are required to be detected if these parameters and requirements are consistent for the collection of rock samples being analysed then as shown by the experimental results values for l and y can remain unchanged 2 2 4 user defined parameters the proposed method recommends a certain process for determining user defined input parameters for each class of images input parameters are first determined on an exemplar and then fixed for all other 3d image samples belonging to the same class for example in section 3 an exemplar of the shale class is used to determine the free parameters which then remain unaltered when processing other shale test samples due to substantially differing image statistics between image classes e g shale and coal it is not feasible to employ a single set of input parameters across all image datasets a list of required user defined parameters and their respective values used in this study for each class of input images is shown in table 1 note that there are only two free parameters required for the proposed method which is a considerable reduction in relation to other comparable approaches applied to similar types of 3d imagery the oriented filter threshold ratio refers to the β parameter in eq 10 and the oriented gaussian disc diameter refers to the spatial extent of the applied gaussian filter 2 2 5 computational complexity all steps of the proposed algorithm can be implemented with low computational complexity for section 2 2 1 the off diagonal gaussian derivatives in eq 2 which has the form g σ s s x s y σ 4 can be implemented using separable filters the diagonal elements which has the form g σ s s x 2 σ 2 σ 4 can be implemented as the difference between two separable filters further efficiency can be achieved if some of the intermediate steps are combined the eigenvalues of a 3x3 matrix can be found without iterations using the algorithm proposed by smith 1961 the algorithm in section 2 2 2 involves a simple filtering step for these sections the subsequent steps of thresholding and generating candidate fracture maps are also simple operations for section 2 2 3 identifying region volumes within a binary 3d volume can be performed with one pass through the volume one plane at a time in each pass new regions can be created if they appear or merged if they intersect this approach has a complexity comparable to that of filtering once regions within the volume are identified the largest axis can be found by evaluating the eigenvectors of a 3x3 matrix this step can exploit the aforementioned algorithm 3 results and discussions in generating all results for the proposed algorithm the minimum limit for the major axis length attribute l is determined by setting λ 0 5 in accordance with eq 13 and the minimum volume threshold is set to y 1000 these values were chosen empirically based on observation of some coal and shale samples and were then kept unchanged since the imaging setup was not altered fig 5 shows an area near a low density porous region here the simple thresholding method was used and its results were compared with the proposed algorithm this is because as explained before the number of segmentation methods exceeds a hundred iassonov et al 2009 and we cannot apply and compare all of the available methods choosing any specific segmentation method would limit the audience to those who are familiar with that specific method however the simple thresholding method is one of the widely used methods and most of the readers are familiar with the way it functions thus we do not compare the relative performance of the method to the range of other fracture methods in the literature perhaps the method can be complementary to other fracture segmentation methods it is observed that by choosing a threshold value of a which is set to capture fractures as long as the low density regions are not included the fracture f cannot be segmented fig 5b choosing a higher threshold value b which captures the entire fractures regardless of the inclusion of low density regions results in capturing a large portion of low density regions that have greyscale values similar to fracture f fig 5c setting thresholds a or b thus results in mislabeling of the fractures and accordingly undersegmentation and oversegmentation of the fractures present in the sample such undersegmentation and oversegmentation significantly impact the computation of digital rock physical properties apart from imaging artefacts which can significantly impact the quality of micro ct images karimpouli et al 2020a some of the segmentation challenges such as the ones discussed above arise from inherent micro ct imaging limitations a common challenge with micro ct imaging is the balance between the sample size and image resolution the samples need to be sufficiently large to represent the rock being studied furthermore in highly fractured rocks obtaining a sample that contains a representative fracture network is highly challenging however the larger the sample the coarser the micro ct resolution thin fractures thus usually occur near the resolution limit of the image the fractures apertures in the direction normal to fractures are generally characterised by only a few voxels making their detection and visualisation difficult ramandi et al 2017 moreover in micro ct imaging the material at each point affects the adjacent materials intensity values due to the averaging produced by the nonzero size of the x ray focal spot and or detectors therefore the greyscale transition between two adjacent materials with different densities such as two minerals with very high and low densities or a mineral and air void spaces rather than being sharp spans several voxel widths ketcham 2005 another inherent micro ct imaging characteristic is the partial volume effect that refers to where the volume voxel contains two or more materials in such voxels the greyscale value represents the average properties of the included materials hsieh 2009 ketcham and carlson 2001 therefore the fractures that occur near the resolution limit of the image often obtain greyscale values between the values of void and the adjacent material these void spaces fractures and pores can be segmented as a sub resolution phase qajar et al 2012 ramandi et al 2016b the first step before resolving the sub resolution phase aperture size measurement or any other measurement is fracture detection both the resolved and sub resolution fractures due to the above mentioned micro ct imaging limitations in many digital fractured rocks there are sub resolution fractures that have greyscale values similar or even below that of some low density or microporous materials which cannot be segmented using the existing methods to assess the proposed algorithms performance in identifying the fractures a portion of the shale sample fig 6 a is manually segmented with caution and used as a groundtruth image fig 6b the manual segmentation process which was extremely time consuming included a layer by layer inspection of the image and a manual selection of the fractures this process was facilitated by a combination of the masking and brushing tools of avizo 9 2 as explained in ramandi et al 2018 fig 6c and d present the results of applying thresholds a and b showing a clear undersegmentation and oversegmentation of the fractures the result of the application of the proposed method to the digital shale sample for detection of the fractures is shown in fig 6e the visual comparison of fig 6e with other segmentation results shows that the proposed method achieved a more realistic fracture structure than the ones obtained by applying thresholds a and b i e very similar to the groundtruth image it is noticed that the method performs satisfactorily where the fracture apertures are near the resolution of micro ct image particularly in the region f this is because the method can connect the low greyscale values that create a fracture in any direction which is challenging even by looking at individual voxels in some directions when the fractures are manually segmented the proposed method was further applied to another shale sample and two coal samples in all images threshold value a was set to only capture fractures without the inclusion of any other regions while threshold b was set to capture the entire fractures although it might include other low density regions fig 7 shows the results for the shale sample containing a couple of fractures running through higher density minerals it is visually observed that applying thresholds a fig 7b and b fig 7c result in undersegmentation and oversegmentation which can decrease the accuracy of the analysed data the proposed algorithm nevertheless delivers relatively realistic results fig 7b as confirmed by the groundtruth image in fig 6 the segmentation outcomes for the coal samples are shown in figs 8 and 9 similar results to that of the shale samples are seen for coal samples where the proposed method delivers relatively realistic segmentation outcomes in particular the proposed method excludes the isolated islands that do not form a disc type geometry the only segmentation outcomes in which the fracture aperture sizes are more accurate than others are the undersegmented data threshold a this is because in the undersegmented data mainly the resolved fractures which have aperture sizes at or above the resolution limit of the image are segmented as fractures fracture aperture sizes in all other images even the groundtruth image are inaccurate as they also contain sub resolution fractures this means that at least one voxel e g 13 6 µm in the shale sample is allocated to the fracture aperture even where the aperture sizes are less than the image resolution voxel size in this study which is inaccurate a few methods for fracture aperture size measurement and calibration have been developed johns et al 1993 keller 1998 ketcham et al 2010 mazumder et al 2006 ramandi et al 2016a ramandi et al 2017 robert et al 1993 van geet et al 2001 vandersteen et al 2003 verhelst et al 1995 which are not within the scope of this study however integration of an aperture size computation method to the currently proposed algorithm is an objective for future works as the method can readily adopt fracture aperture as an input for further tuning producing a 3d image with accurate fracture structures and dimensions and other pore spaces would be significant for many digital rock analyses such as petrophysical and geomechanical analyses here to further analyse the impacts of the segmentation on the physical structure of the fractured samples a skeleton of the fracture network is obtained for each image which eliminates the impact of fracture aperture size as presented in fig 10 the surface area of the one voxel width fractures are measured and the surface area to volume ratio sa v is then computed fig 10 table 2 provides the sa v results of all samples which indicates the significant impact that the segmentation has on obtaining the fracture network and consequently computation of the physical fractured rocks properties for the shale sample shown in fig 6 the sa v results of the application of thresholds a 4 7e 02 mm 1 and b 2 4e 01 mm 1 are highly different from the groundtruth image 7 6e 02 mm 1 while the result of the proposed method 8 6e 02 mm 1 is very similar to the groundtruth this implies that the proposed method significantly outperforms the conventional segmentation methods in terms of fracture detection being automatic also means that the subjectivity of the segmentation task is eliminated this ability allows for an accurate comparison of different digital rocks as the user effect bias is minimised 4 conclusion fractures are complex 3d features in rocks occurring at different scales micro ct imaging is a reliable technique for non destructive visualisation of fractures in core scale rock samples however to accurately characterise fracture captured in micro ct images the greyscale images need to be segmented consequently segmentation of 3d fractures in micro ct images is a critical task for digital rock physics analysis the first step in fractured rocks segmentation is the detection of 3d fractures prior to determining the exact aperture sizes the method proposed in this study is shown to be robust for detecting the 3d fractures in greyscale micro ct images while conventional methods generally deliver undersegmented or oversegmented results the proposed algorithm results in appropriately segmented data as verified by comparing with manually segmented groundtruth data the impact of accurate detection of fractures on preserving fractures physical properties is highlighted by computing and comparing the surface areas of skeletons of the images labelled by the proposed algorithm and conventional methods future work will aim to integrate an aperture measurement method with the proposed algorithm to identify realistic fracture representation

3585,fractures have a governing effect on the physical properties of fractured rocks such as permeability accurate representation of 3d fractures is therefore required for precise analysis of digital fractured rocks however conventional segmentation methods fail to detect and label the fractures with aperture sizes near or below the resolution of 3d micro computed tomographic micro ct images which are visible in the greyscale images and where greyscale intensity convolution between different phases exists in addition conventional methods are highly subjective to user interpretation herein a novel algorithm for the automatic detection of fractures from greyscale 3d micro ct images is proposed the algorithm involves a low level early vision stage which identifies potential fractures followed by a high level interpretative stage which enforces planar continuity to reject false positives and more reliably extract planar fractures from digital rock images a manually segmented fractured shale sample was used as the groundtruth with which the efficacy of the algorithm in 3d fracture detection was validated following this the proposed and conventional methods were applied to detect fractures in digital fractured coal and shale samples based on these analyses the impact of fracture detection accuracy on the analysis of fractured rocks physical properties was inferred keywords fracture detection micro ct image computer vision fractured media 1 introduction fracture networks in rocks are generally complex they can range from micro scale fractures in rock cores of a few cubic millimetres to mega scale fractures and faults of a few thousand kilometres in the earth crust accurate characterisation of the fracture network is important in many disciplines such as water petroleum mining and civil engineering fractures particularly conductive fractures can greatly impact the physical properties of any rocktype in terms of fluid flow well connected fractures enhance the permeability of the rocks significantly especially for tight rocktypes a range of techniques have been developed to characterise and visualise fracture networks at core scale such as optical microscopy serati et al 2021 zhang et al 1999 scanning electron microscopy sem fonseka et al 1985 lindqvist et al 1984 ramandi et al 2016a zhou et al 2016 neutron tomography christe et al 2007 siddiqui et al 2021 and x ray micro computed tomography micro ct arshadi et al 2017 gomila et al 2021 lv et al 2019 qi et al 2018 ramandi et al 2015 ramandi et al 2017 roshan et al 2019 permeability of the fractured rocks with low matrix permeability is primarily controlled by dimensions spacing connectivity and mineralisation level of the fractures ramandi et al 2016b zhao et al 2021 measuring aperture attributes locally and taking into account their variations are highly complex tasks therefore for fluid flow analysis fractures have traditionally been simplified as a set of parallel plates and the cubic law is applied to simulate the flow al raoush and papadopoulos 2010 karpyn et al 2007 however it is now well established that the fractures are rough walled channels significantly influencing the flow regimes al raoush and papadopoulos 2010 li et al 2020 pruess and tsang 1990 wang et al 2021 among different imaging techniques the micro ct technique possesses the advantage of the provision of high fidelity high resolution non destructive 3d images suitable for numerical simulations the technique can capture geometrically complex natural fractures however to characterise the fractured rock attributes quantitatively the greyscale multiphase micro ct images need to be segmented into different unique phases that are homogeneous with respect to some characteristic the number of labels phases depends on the purpose of the study and the available micro ct image data and its quality for flow simulation a two phase digital rock where void space and solid phases are labelled is usually required however three phase digital rocks including resolved void spaces solid phase and sub resolution void spaces voxels that are partially filled with void spaces are also used for flow simulation which account for the influence of micro voids on permeability qajar et al 2012 soulaine et al 2016 hybrid and dual domain models where a resolved phase generally a high permeability phase and sub resolution phase generally a relatively low permeability phase are uniquely labelled are also employed to compute the transport properties of digital porous media soulaine et al 2016 yang et al 2019 segmentation is therefore the most crucial step in image processing that will have a profound impact on all subsequent image analyses and simulations iassonov et al 2009 schlüter et al 2014 several free and commercial software toolboxes have been developed with some form of image processing analysis and visualisation capabilities such as imagej schneider et al 2012 itk ibanez et al 2005 blob3d ketcham 2005 scikit image van der walt et al 2014 scanip segment 3dviewnix and amira avizo the number of segmentation methods in the literature exceeds a hundred iassonov et al 2009 and a small fraction of those are specifically targeted fractured media however no segmentation method excels at all segmentation tasks and performs an errorless segmentation several classification schemes have been proposed in the literature for image segmentation with a number of methods included in more than one class iassonov et al 2009 global thresholding methods include approaches where voxels are classified based on greyscale histogram evaluation only without considering how the greyscale values are spatially arranged in corresponding images schlüter et al 2014 sezgin and sankur 2004 stathis et al 2008 in contrast locally adaptive segmentation methods include those making a segmentation decision for each voxel using neighbourhood statistics it is known that in general employing local information can provide relatively satisfying segmentation results deng et al 2016 schlüter et al 2014 stathis et al 2008 a comprehensive survey by schlüter et al 2014 discussed a number of well known segmentation methods and showed that the converging active contours cac method is well suited for multiphase segmentation of micro ct images cac uses local gradient and intensity greyscale value information at the same time sheppard et al 2004 its major drawback lies in its sensitivity to seed region detection and the adjustment of parameters for the speed function iassonov et al 2009 cac techniques also cannot extract all the fractures in the fractured 3d images ramandi et al 2017 ramandi et al 2018 furthermore almost all segmentation methods need some inputs from the user making the segmentation processes a subjective task different segmentation results are thus obtained from users with different levels of expertise which makes the comparison of different data and results challenging and erroneous several approaches based on the deep learning technique have been recently proposed asadi and beckingham 2021 cheng and guo 2017 karimpouli et al 2020b li et al 2019 wang et al 2019 however a major issue when adopting such methods is that they require large training datasets comprising of a large number of correctly segmented images but such datasets are not widely available additionally a deep learning system trained on a dataset is generally only accurate for the same specific rock sample from which the training data is obtained therefore the subjectivity of segmentation remains a significant challenge the presence of discontinuities such as ridges valleys and fractures in images all correspond to high levels of change of the imagery data within a confined local spatial region for this reason first and second order gradient information is often used in feature detection tasks prior works eberly et al 1994 lopez et al 1999 have utilised second order information in the form of eigenvectors and eigenvalues of the hessian matrix along with first order local gradient calculations of the image data to identify local maxima ridges and minima valleys in the direction of main principal curvature such approaches are successful in detecting curves or skeletons corresponding to ridges and valleys in images but are not designed to detect and segment fractures of varying width the method proposed in this paper also employs the hessian matrix to determine local curvature characteristics however this information is used to identify a volumetric region of high curvature as opposed to a curve of local maxima minima points in general eigenvalue decomposition of the hessian matrix has been deployed for feature detection in a range of applications from medical fornaro et al 2010 frangi et al 1998 to geoscience liang 2016 imaging its utility arises from the fact that eigenvalues of the matrix correspond to local contrast changes along the principal directions of curvature as defined by the eigenvectors as an extension to this approach voorn et al 2013 investigated deploying the hessian matrix at multiple scales to identify fractures in 3d images this work is closely related to the method proposed in this study with the multiscale approach suited to extracting fractures with a range of apertures from image datasets important differences between the two approaches relate to the way in which eigenvalue information is utilised to identify potential fracture regions the proposed approach avoids the normalisation and calibration steps applied to eigenvalues at each voxel and substantially reduces the input parameters that are required for the hessian filtering stage as explained in later sections the proposed approach directly compares the largest eigenvalue at each location with a contrast threshold that is determined from input image statistics and multiscale hessian filter characteristics thereby eliminating any need for specific user defined parameters furthermore complementing the high pass hessian analysis the proposed method implements a directional low pass filtering stage to address issues caused by noise and problematic small high contrast structures that are often accentuated by high pass hessian filtering at the finest scale currently the orientation information provided by the eigenvectors of the hessian matrix is not used and remains a topic of interest for future work the orientation of the gaussian disc is calculated independently from the hessian matrix allowing both processing stages to remain separate and thereby complementary to each other in this study we thus present fracdetect a novel algorithm for detecting fractures from greyscale 3d micro ct that combines the advantages of voxel level fracture detection similar to global thresholding methods with the accuracy of locally adaptive segmentation methods in a two stage framework specifically in the first stage of the proposed algorithm individual voxels in the 3d micro ct image that could correspond to fractures are identified based on two principles a along the direction perpendicular to a fracture two sharp changes in voxel intensity can be expected corresponding to the edges of the fracture and b a fracture is locally planar and has a much shorter extent along one direction compared to the other two orthogonal directions this is followed by a second stage which imposes the constraint that voxels corresponding to a fracture must be connected to other such voxels and cannot be isolated the proposed algorithm is also developed with a view of minimising the number of the threshold values that will need to be manually tuned with the most relevant thresholds in the algorithm automatically inferred from the 3d image data the algorithm s performance is assessed by comparing its output with a manually segmented fractured shale sample additionally the algorithm is employed on fractured shale and coal samples and the results are compared with those obtained from conventional segmentation methods 2 material and methods 2 1 digital rock data acquisition a shale and a coal sample were used in this study as two cases of low permeability rocks containing fractures the shale sample was an organic rich shale obtained from the middle velkerri formation beetaloo sub basin the state of northern territory australia details on the petrophysical properties of the shale can be found in algazlan et al 2019 the sample contained 3 15 wt organic carbon and major clay minerals were illite muscovite 15 7 wt and illite smectite 7 4 wt the coal sample was sub bituminous coal from the baralaba coal measures on the south eastern flank of the bowen basin the state of queensland australia details on the coal specifications including petrophysical properties and proximate and ultimate analyses results are given in ramandi et al 2016b micro ct imaging of the samples was conducted using a helical micro ct scanner sheppard et al 2014 the helical scanner uses a double helix scanning trajectory varslot et al 2012 to acquire data that facilitate efficient utilisation of the available x ray flux sheppard et al 2014 the scanner acquires a series of projections from the sample at different viewing angles the projections characterise the cumulative attenuation of the x ray beam through the sample the acquired projections are then entered into a reconstruction algorithm based on katsevich 2002 to reconstruct a 3d image tomogram the tomograms are usually presented in 16 bit greyscale images where each data point characterises the effective x ray attenuation coefficient of the sample at that specific point more details on the helical scanner and its specifications can be found in sheppard et al 2014 and ramandi et al 2016a the imaged volume of the shale sample was a cylindrical core with a diameter of about 13 mm and a length of about 20 mm with a resolution of 13 6 µm the coal image had a diameter of about 25 mm and a length of about 35 mm with a resolution of about 16 5 µm 2 2 proposed algorithm a novel two stage algorithm which includes a low level early vision stage and a high level interpretative stage is proposed for fracture detection the low level stage which is referred to as a fracture map here generates an initial estimate of whether a fracture exists at each location in the 3d digital rock following this the high level stage imposes reasonable constraints that fractures are not small isolated regions for the low level stage two separate filtering steps that complement each other are used one employs the hessian matrix while the other utilises an oriented gaussian disc a block diagram of the proposed algorithm is shown in fig 1 the hessian matrix provides high pass frequency information pertaining to rapid changes in image data while this stage is important to detecting fractures the presence of noise and small isolated structures can be problematic especially at the finer scales of the multiscale approach to address these issues a complementary oriented gaussian filtering stage is also implemented providing adaptive low pass information that is used with a conservative threshold to reduce falsely detected fracture regions from the high pass hessian filtering stage to remain sensitive to small structures such as high intensity blobs in the image data the standard deviation of the oriented gaussian disc filter is chosen to be 1 in all test cases the applied diameter of the disc filter is also chosen to be small refer to table 1 to match the local planar geometry of fractures to provide more insight into the operation of each stage and to highlight the complementary nature of the two filtering steps fig 2 is presented to show the output of each processing stage for two different input image samples in fig 2 a a potential problematic region in the input slice comprised of white blobs with sharp edges is highlighted red dashed line rectangle the corresponding output of each of the two filtering stages is shown by the accompanying binary images on the top row where black corresponds to potential fracture regions and white refers to the absence of any fracture features the multiscale hessian filter incorrectly classifies parts of the problematic region as potential fractures e g edges of the white blobs while the oriented gaussian filter is able to correctly discard these regions in the alternative example in fig 2 d the problematic region is caused by a slow varying grey area red dashed line oval while this region is correctly classified by the multiscale hessian filter it is falsely identified as a fracture by the oriented gaussian filter in both cases combining the output of the two filtering stages produces a more reliable and faithful segmentation result the final segmented output produced by the proposed algorithm along with corresponding groundtruth for the two input samples are shown in fig 3 the segmented results in the top and bottom rows of fig 3 correspond to the respective input samples shown in the top and bottom rows of fig 2 2 2 1 the hessian matrix for fracture detection in the proposed method the second derivative of gaussian shown in fig 4 serves as a template for fracture matching in typical greyscale tomograms low x ray attenuating materials e g air are presented by low greyscale values as such an empty fracture which is filled with the air appears darker than its adjacent regions in the tomograms filtering with the template thus produces positive responses in locations where fractures exist locally the width of the template can be adjusted by modifying the standard deviation σ of the gaussian in this work a set of standard deviations σ is employed to accommodate a range of possible fracture widths template matching can be efficiently implemented as a convolution with a mirror image of the template but since the second derivative is symmetric mirroring is redundant here the 3d digital rock is denoted as v s where s t s x s y s z is a location within that image then 1 v xx σ s 2 g σ s x 2 v s g σ 2 v s x 2 s 2 s x 2 v g σ s where g σ s e x p s t s 2 σ 2 2 π σ 2 3 2 is the gaussian function and is the convolution operator consequently one can think of the convolution with the second derivative as being equivalent to first convolving the rock image v with a gaussian g σ and then taking the second derivative noting that the second derivative is very sensitive to noise this convolution with a gaussian reduces the noise in the digital rock v and makes the result reliable since fractures can occur in any orientation it is useful to evaluate the second derivate in any direction denoted by the direction vector d with d 2 1 this can be achieved by utilising d t h σ d where h σ is the hessian matrix of the rock image v which is given by 2 h σ s v xx σ s v yx σ s v zx σ s v xy σ s v yy σ s v zy σ s v xz σ s v yz σ s v zz σ s s r 3 where the elements of the hessian are given by second order partial derivatives of the 3d rock image i e v xy σ s 2 g σ s x s y v s in practice however acquiring the digital rock involves sampling the 3d image v s to obtain a discrete image v n where n z 3 consequently the second derivative of gaussian v xy σ n obtained from v 2 g σ s x s y n is valid so long as the nyquist sampling theorem is observed σ must be around 1 or larger so that nyquist theorem is observed for the gaussian as well for the discrete domain oriented second derivative of gaussian it is also well established that it can be obtained as a linear combination of a set of 6 basis discrete domain second derivatives which are in this work the 6 unique partial derivatives in the hessian matrix derpanis and gryn 2005 freeman and adelson 1991 this is only valid for the second derivative of gaussian since the hessian matrix is symmetric it has only real eigenvalues and its eigenvectors are orthogonal the largest magnitude eigenvalue λ m a x σ is equal to the largest magnitude second derivative and the normalised eigenvector associated with λ m a x σ is the direction d m a x σ at which this derivative is obtained this can be obtained from the eigenvalue definition h σ d m a x σ λ m a x d m a x σ multiplying by d m a x σ t which lead to 3 d m a x σ t h m a x σ d max σ d m a x σ t λ m a x σ d m a x σ λ m a x σ normalising or scaling the eigenvector has no effect on the eigenvalue λ m a x σ since c h σ d m a x σ c λ m a x σ d m a x σ where c is a scaling factor also the sign of eigenvalues does not change when the scaling factor c is negative negative eigenvalues are of no interest since they are associated with anti template where the rock image has a bright region between two darker regions in the vicinity of a fracture it is expected the direction d m a x σ to be perpendicular to the fracture plane and the two eigenvalues other than the largest λ m a x σ to be significantly smaller than λ m a x σ a set of standard deviations σ is employed in this work where 1 2 6 larger standard deviations can be employed for wider fractures then for each standard deviation σ a binary image a σ is evaluated using 4 a σ n 1 λ m a x σ n τ a σ 0 o t h e r w i s e where τ a σ is a threshold to evaluate this threshold a contrast value ρ is found from the difference between the mean of the digital rock v n and the mean of the smallest 3 values in v n then the threshold τ a σ is set equal to ρ v 3 d b where v 3 d b is chosen such that the width of the fracture is the distance from the point at which the response to the second derivative of gaussian filter is half its peak to the corresponding point on the other side of the centre of the fracture specifically fractures are detected by comparing regions of the rock image to the second derivative of gaussian template and the response to this filter would attain a local peak when the template is centred on the fracture here edges are defined as the points on either side where the response is 3 db below the peak this way the threshold adapts to the rock image v n the generated binary image a σ represents locations that are likely to have a fracture finally the second derivative of gaussian analysis produces 5 a n max σ σ a σ n 2 2 2 oriented gaussian disc as noted fracture regions correspond to lower image intensity greyscale values i e darker regions than their neighbours a local averaging filter is therefore applied and this local average is compared to a global threshold determined from the statistics of the input sample thus no user supplied information is required the idea here is to evaluate the average over an oriented gaussian disc noting that the desired minimum filter response will always be observed when the orientation of the gaussian disc aligns with that of the fracture as the orientation of the fracture is unknown one approach is to apply incrementally rotated versions of gaussian disc and choose the minimum filter response as the one that best aligns with the fracture orientation such an approach is computationally expensive a more efficient implementation can be achieved by performing operations in the fourier domain as explained next first the rock image v s is multiplied by a gaussian function g t σ s g σ s t centred at location t to obtain a ball 6 f t σ s v s g t σ s in this system gaussian functions with a standard deviation of one are taken only therefore the superscript σ is dropped from all terms in this section for ease of reading by taking the fourier transform f ω of that ball the fourier transform of a series of discs d t y z s x perpendicular to the x axis can be written as 7 f t ω x 0 0 f t s d s y d s z d t y z s x e j ω x s x d s x the desired oriented gaussian disc in the yz plane at location t x 0 is then obtained using the inverse fourier transform of f t ω x 0 0 i e 8 d t y z 0 1 2 π f t ω x 0 0 d ω x discs in other orientations can similarly be obtained by integrating the fourier transformed function f ω in a direction perpendicular to the plane of the disc in this work experimental results have shown that it is sufficient to evaluate only three such discs d xy n d yz n and d xz n the minimum of this disc d m i n n min d xy n d yz n d xz n is then computed as this would correspond to the most likely orientation of the fracture that might exist at that location similar to section 0 binary image b n is evaluated using 9 b n 1 d m i n n τ b 0 o t h e r w i s e where τ b is a threshold obtained from 10 τ b β n n min d m i n n μ v where n is the number of voxels in the digital rock v n μ v is the mean of v n and β is a user defined ratio typically in the range of 0 7 to 0 9 a final candidate fracture map c n is obtained using a n b n 2 2 3 high level interpretation the hessian and oriented gaussian filtering stages provide local low level features summarised in the form of a binary map it is important to note that both filtering stages remain agnostic to any high level information such as expected fracture length and volume the high level analysis stage shown in fig 1 considers the individual binary voxels over a wide spatial span and measures attributes of connected components such as major axis length and volume these measured attributes are then compared to expected values to decide if observed connected components are representative of fractures the high level analysis is performed on the candidate fracture map c n fracture regions as noted before are typically not small isolated regions but form part of a larger spatially connected set of voxels in disc form 3d connectivity analysis he et al 2017 toriwaki and yoshida 2009 is therefore employed to remove small connected regions potentially caused by noise while retaining 3d regions that exceed certain minimum limits more specifically connectivity analysis is performed on the binary candidate fracture map c n identifying sets s i comprised of maximal spatially connected candidate voxels a 6 neighbour 3d connectivity criteria is used such that voxels at locations n 1 and n 2 are considered to be directly connected if c n 1 c n 2 1 and n 2 n 1 2 1 the two attributes of major axis length and volume of a connected component s i can be best described in terms of its corresponding raw moments m pqr i and normalised central moments μ pqr i gonzalez and woods 2018 as defined below 11 m pqr i n s i n x p n y q n z r 12 μ pqr i 1 m 000 i n s i n x n x p n y n y q n z n z r where n n x n y n z and n x n y n z m 100 i m 000 i m 010 i m 000 i m 001 i m 000 i refers to the centroid of the region s i to determine the major axis length attribute l i an ellipsoid centred at n x n y n z is constructed such that the spatial region e i bounded by the ellipsoid corresponds to the same second order normalised central moments as s i chaumette 2004 rocha et al 2002 that is moments μ pqr i for p q r 2 remain the same when eq 11 and 12 are redefined for n e i the major axis length l i is the largest diameter of this constructed ellipsoid modelling s i in this work l i is compared to a threshold l and if l i l then the corresponding set is eliminated as a potential fracture candidate the volume attribute υ i m 000 i is essentially the number of voxels comprising s i and is similarly compared to a corresponding threshold value y if υ i y then s i is omitted as a candidate the lower limit threshold values of l and y are based on observations of collections of both coal and shale samples with available groundtruth data and remain fixed for all test cases considered in this study the value for l is derived as a fixed ratio λ of the minimum dimension of the input rock sample such that 13 l λ m i n d i m x d i m y d i m z where di m x d i m y d i m z represent the width height and depth of the test sample the volume threshold y is derived from average lower limits observed from groundtruth data and also remains unaltered in all experiments without any need for user input both l and y are subject to imaging system parameters including the achieved image resolution and the scale at which fractures are required to be detected if these parameters and requirements are consistent for the collection of rock samples being analysed then as shown by the experimental results values for l and y can remain unchanged 2 2 4 user defined parameters the proposed method recommends a certain process for determining user defined input parameters for each class of images input parameters are first determined on an exemplar and then fixed for all other 3d image samples belonging to the same class for example in section 3 an exemplar of the shale class is used to determine the free parameters which then remain unaltered when processing other shale test samples due to substantially differing image statistics between image classes e g shale and coal it is not feasible to employ a single set of input parameters across all image datasets a list of required user defined parameters and their respective values used in this study for each class of input images is shown in table 1 note that there are only two free parameters required for the proposed method which is a considerable reduction in relation to other comparable approaches applied to similar types of 3d imagery the oriented filter threshold ratio refers to the β parameter in eq 10 and the oriented gaussian disc diameter refers to the spatial extent of the applied gaussian filter 2 2 5 computational complexity all steps of the proposed algorithm can be implemented with low computational complexity for section 2 2 1 the off diagonal gaussian derivatives in eq 2 which has the form g σ s s x s y σ 4 can be implemented using separable filters the diagonal elements which has the form g σ s s x 2 σ 2 σ 4 can be implemented as the difference between two separable filters further efficiency can be achieved if some of the intermediate steps are combined the eigenvalues of a 3x3 matrix can be found without iterations using the algorithm proposed by smith 1961 the algorithm in section 2 2 2 involves a simple filtering step for these sections the subsequent steps of thresholding and generating candidate fracture maps are also simple operations for section 2 2 3 identifying region volumes within a binary 3d volume can be performed with one pass through the volume one plane at a time in each pass new regions can be created if they appear or merged if they intersect this approach has a complexity comparable to that of filtering once regions within the volume are identified the largest axis can be found by evaluating the eigenvectors of a 3x3 matrix this step can exploit the aforementioned algorithm 3 results and discussions in generating all results for the proposed algorithm the minimum limit for the major axis length attribute l is determined by setting λ 0 5 in accordance with eq 13 and the minimum volume threshold is set to y 1000 these values were chosen empirically based on observation of some coal and shale samples and were then kept unchanged since the imaging setup was not altered fig 5 shows an area near a low density porous region here the simple thresholding method was used and its results were compared with the proposed algorithm this is because as explained before the number of segmentation methods exceeds a hundred iassonov et al 2009 and we cannot apply and compare all of the available methods choosing any specific segmentation method would limit the audience to those who are familiar with that specific method however the simple thresholding method is one of the widely used methods and most of the readers are familiar with the way it functions thus we do not compare the relative performance of the method to the range of other fracture methods in the literature perhaps the method can be complementary to other fracture segmentation methods it is observed that by choosing a threshold value of a which is set to capture fractures as long as the low density regions are not included the fracture f cannot be segmented fig 5b choosing a higher threshold value b which captures the entire fractures regardless of the inclusion of low density regions results in capturing a large portion of low density regions that have greyscale values similar to fracture f fig 5c setting thresholds a or b thus results in mislabeling of the fractures and accordingly undersegmentation and oversegmentation of the fractures present in the sample such undersegmentation and oversegmentation significantly impact the computation of digital rock physical properties apart from imaging artefacts which can significantly impact the quality of micro ct images karimpouli et al 2020a some of the segmentation challenges such as the ones discussed above arise from inherent micro ct imaging limitations a common challenge with micro ct imaging is the balance between the sample size and image resolution the samples need to be sufficiently large to represent the rock being studied furthermore in highly fractured rocks obtaining a sample that contains a representative fracture network is highly challenging however the larger the sample the coarser the micro ct resolution thin fractures thus usually occur near the resolution limit of the image the fractures apertures in the direction normal to fractures are generally characterised by only a few voxels making their detection and visualisation difficult ramandi et al 2017 moreover in micro ct imaging the material at each point affects the adjacent materials intensity values due to the averaging produced by the nonzero size of the x ray focal spot and or detectors therefore the greyscale transition between two adjacent materials with different densities such as two minerals with very high and low densities or a mineral and air void spaces rather than being sharp spans several voxel widths ketcham 2005 another inherent micro ct imaging characteristic is the partial volume effect that refers to where the volume voxel contains two or more materials in such voxels the greyscale value represents the average properties of the included materials hsieh 2009 ketcham and carlson 2001 therefore the fractures that occur near the resolution limit of the image often obtain greyscale values between the values of void and the adjacent material these void spaces fractures and pores can be segmented as a sub resolution phase qajar et al 2012 ramandi et al 2016b the first step before resolving the sub resolution phase aperture size measurement or any other measurement is fracture detection both the resolved and sub resolution fractures due to the above mentioned micro ct imaging limitations in many digital fractured rocks there are sub resolution fractures that have greyscale values similar or even below that of some low density or microporous materials which cannot be segmented using the existing methods to assess the proposed algorithms performance in identifying the fractures a portion of the shale sample fig 6 a is manually segmented with caution and used as a groundtruth image fig 6b the manual segmentation process which was extremely time consuming included a layer by layer inspection of the image and a manual selection of the fractures this process was facilitated by a combination of the masking and brushing tools of avizo 9 2 as explained in ramandi et al 2018 fig 6c and d present the results of applying thresholds a and b showing a clear undersegmentation and oversegmentation of the fractures the result of the application of the proposed method to the digital shale sample for detection of the fractures is shown in fig 6e the visual comparison of fig 6e with other segmentation results shows that the proposed method achieved a more realistic fracture structure than the ones obtained by applying thresholds a and b i e very similar to the groundtruth image it is noticed that the method performs satisfactorily where the fracture apertures are near the resolution of micro ct image particularly in the region f this is because the method can connect the low greyscale values that create a fracture in any direction which is challenging even by looking at individual voxels in some directions when the fractures are manually segmented the proposed method was further applied to another shale sample and two coal samples in all images threshold value a was set to only capture fractures without the inclusion of any other regions while threshold b was set to capture the entire fractures although it might include other low density regions fig 7 shows the results for the shale sample containing a couple of fractures running through higher density minerals it is visually observed that applying thresholds a fig 7b and b fig 7c result in undersegmentation and oversegmentation which can decrease the accuracy of the analysed data the proposed algorithm nevertheless delivers relatively realistic results fig 7b as confirmed by the groundtruth image in fig 6 the segmentation outcomes for the coal samples are shown in figs 8 and 9 similar results to that of the shale samples are seen for coal samples where the proposed method delivers relatively realistic segmentation outcomes in particular the proposed method excludes the isolated islands that do not form a disc type geometry the only segmentation outcomes in which the fracture aperture sizes are more accurate than others are the undersegmented data threshold a this is because in the undersegmented data mainly the resolved fractures which have aperture sizes at or above the resolution limit of the image are segmented as fractures fracture aperture sizes in all other images even the groundtruth image are inaccurate as they also contain sub resolution fractures this means that at least one voxel e g 13 6 µm in the shale sample is allocated to the fracture aperture even where the aperture sizes are less than the image resolution voxel size in this study which is inaccurate a few methods for fracture aperture size measurement and calibration have been developed johns et al 1993 keller 1998 ketcham et al 2010 mazumder et al 2006 ramandi et al 2016a ramandi et al 2017 robert et al 1993 van geet et al 2001 vandersteen et al 2003 verhelst et al 1995 which are not within the scope of this study however integration of an aperture size computation method to the currently proposed algorithm is an objective for future works as the method can readily adopt fracture aperture as an input for further tuning producing a 3d image with accurate fracture structures and dimensions and other pore spaces would be significant for many digital rock analyses such as petrophysical and geomechanical analyses here to further analyse the impacts of the segmentation on the physical structure of the fractured samples a skeleton of the fracture network is obtained for each image which eliminates the impact of fracture aperture size as presented in fig 10 the surface area of the one voxel width fractures are measured and the surface area to volume ratio sa v is then computed fig 10 table 2 provides the sa v results of all samples which indicates the significant impact that the segmentation has on obtaining the fracture network and consequently computation of the physical fractured rocks properties for the shale sample shown in fig 6 the sa v results of the application of thresholds a 4 7e 02 mm 1 and b 2 4e 01 mm 1 are highly different from the groundtruth image 7 6e 02 mm 1 while the result of the proposed method 8 6e 02 mm 1 is very similar to the groundtruth this implies that the proposed method significantly outperforms the conventional segmentation methods in terms of fracture detection being automatic also means that the subjectivity of the segmentation task is eliminated this ability allows for an accurate comparison of different digital rocks as the user effect bias is minimised 4 conclusion fractures are complex 3d features in rocks occurring at different scales micro ct imaging is a reliable technique for non destructive visualisation of fractures in core scale rock samples however to accurately characterise fracture captured in micro ct images the greyscale images need to be segmented consequently segmentation of 3d fractures in micro ct images is a critical task for digital rock physics analysis the first step in fractured rocks segmentation is the detection of 3d fractures prior to determining the exact aperture sizes the method proposed in this study is shown to be robust for detecting the 3d fractures in greyscale micro ct images while conventional methods generally deliver undersegmented or oversegmented results the proposed algorithm results in appropriately segmented data as verified by comparing with manually segmented groundtruth data the impact of accurate detection of fractures on preserving fractures physical properties is highlighted by computing and comparing the surface areas of skeletons of the images labelled by the proposed algorithm and conventional methods future work will aim to integrate an aperture measurement method with the proposed algorithm to identify realistic fracture representation

3586,high latitude lakes are sensitive to climate change and store information about large scale circulation changes and catchment integrated processes lakes are mainly recharged by meteoric water meaning that some lake sediment proxies may indirectly archive the stable isotopic composition of hydrogen δ2h and oxygen δ18o of past precipitation yet despite similar precipitation input lakes within a region may exhibit a wide range of isotopic values due to the varying influence of inflow seasonality and evaporation moreover the relative sensitivity of each lake to these controls may vary through time something that is difficult to account for here we evaluate the impact of variable inflow δ2h and evaporation on the lake water isotopic composition across northern fennoscandia norway finland and sweden we measured lake water δ2h and δ18o of 135 lakes spanning from the north norwegian coast along a 460 km transect to the bothnian bay sampled from 2018 to 2020 our data show that both coastal and inland lakes are sensitive to distillation during moisture transport and that lakes farther from the atlantic ocean are additionally impacted by evaporation we estimated the isotopic composition of lake water inflow values for evapo concentrated transect lakes δ2hi using a bayesian method resampled transect lakes had more depleted δ2hi in 2020 than in 2019 indicating either that precipitation was 2h depleted or that more winter precipitation contributed inflow to the lakes in 2020 compared to in 2019 we suggest that the more 2h depleted values in 2020 were a response to a snow rich winter associated with extremely positive arctic oscillation ao conditions and increased moisture supply from the north atlantic we find evidence that lake water isotopic variability in this region reflects a combination of seasonal precipitation changes associated with atmospheric circulation changes and catchment integrated evaporation careful consideration of the variable sensitivity to these processes is essential when making inferences about past climate based on lake water isotope proxies keywords lake water isotopes precipitation isotopes moisture source evaporation seasonality proxy interpretation 1 introduction amplified warming in the northern high latitudes is predicted to cause an intensification of the hydrological cycle rawlins et al 2010 collins et al 2013 bintanja selten 2014 bintanja et al 2020 these changes affect both terrestrial and ocean freshwater budgets and have great cryospheric and ecological impact bring et al 2016 vihma et al 2016 wrona et al 2016 arctic precipitation change is caused by two main mechanisms with different seasonal imprints increased local evaporation mainly occurs in fall and winter due to accelerated sea ice loss bintanja selten 2014 bailey et al 2021 in contrast poleward moisture transport is greatest in summer when the meridional temperature and moisture gradients increase the most and continental moisture sources play a significant role vázquez et al 2016 singh et al 2017 furthermore greater interannual variability in the summer moisture influx from extrapolar regions is projected to contribute to increasing interannual variability in arctic precipitation bintanja et al 2020 the projected trends remain uncertain relying on sparse observational data to describe complex spatiotemporal patterns to improve the constraints on long term variability in precipitation and atmospheric circulation we can use lake water derived proxy records sundqvist et al 2014 linderholm et al 2018 stable isotope ratios of oxygen δ18o and hydrogen δ2h in precipitation are frequently used to infer processes in the hydrological cycle due to their sensitivity to changes in atmospheric temperature moisture and circulation dansgaard 1964 rozanski et al 1993 gat 1996 much of the variation in precipitation isotopic composition results from equilibrium fractionation during phase changes e g evaporation condensation and freezing during transport from the moisture source to the precipitation site gat 1996 equilibrium fractionation is highly temperature dependent and therefore varies both spatially and temporally the global average relationship between δ2h and δ18o in meteoric waters is described by the global meteoric water line gmwl defined as δ2h 8 δ18o 10 craig 1961 local meteoric water lines lmwls account for site specific variation in the isotopic composition due to factors including moisture sources transport conditions and seasonality for example in seasonally snowy regions slopes of the lmwls tend to be similar to the gmwl but the intercepts lower than in other regions due to snow formation processes putman et al 2019 the isotopic signal of precipitation can be preserved in climate proxies allowing us to extend our records back beyond the instrumental period in northern fennoscandia the oldest temperature and precipitation amount observations date back to the 1860 s alexandersson 2002 whereas precipitation isotope records are limited to a handful of sites most of them only measuring δ18o covering timespans of less than ten years each and only after 1975 iaea wmo 2019 lakes are excellent archives of past climate change as their isotopic composition often at least partially reflects precipitation isotopes and they contain a wide range of proxies that preserve the lake water isotopic composition in northern fennoscandia reconstructions of holocene precipitation humidity and atmospheric circulation have mainly been based on δ18o from lacustrine carbonates hammarlund et al 2002 rosqvist et al 2007 diatom biogenic silica shemesh et al 2001 rosqvist et al 2004 2013 jonsson et al 2010 and lake sediment cellulose st amour et al 2010 other studies use δ2h of lipid biomarkers to reconstruct different aspects of the water cycle nichols et al 2009 thienemann et al 2019 balascio et al 2020 recent dual biomarker approaches have focused on comparing leaf waxes produced by aquatic and terrestrial plants to reconstruct holocene and last interglacial atmospheric circulation changes precipitation seasonality and summer moisture balance rach et al 2017 thomas et al 2018 2020 curtin et al 2019 kjellman et al 2020 katrantsiotis et al 2021 these approaches rely on the assumption that the aquatic plant biomarkers are minimally impacted by evaporative enrichment this might be true for lakes in regions with positive moisture balance precipitation evaporation but not for lakes in more arid areas cluett thomas 2020 when lakes undergo evapo concentration they will deviate from their starting isotopic compositions along the mwl due to kinetic fractionation and evolve along a local evaporation line lel gat 1996 the slope of the lel is controlled by atmospheric conditions e g temperature relative humidity and the isotopic composition of atmospheric moisture and is usually between 5 and 6 at the mid latitudes and sometimes steeper at high latitudes gibson et al 2008 if the slope of the lel is known it can be used along with the lake water δ2h and δ18o values to calculate the intersection between the lel and the mwl which represents lake water inflow values one common approach to estimate regional lel slopes is to adopt a linear regression fit to a group of lakes within the region clark fritz 1997 this approach assumes that all the isotopic variation is a result of evaporation and that all lakes in a region start with the same source isotopic composition i e the lake inflow value bowen et al 2018 this is seldom true especially for systems with a strong seasonality at high latitudes the relative proportion of isotopically depleted snowfall and isotopically enriched rainfall can change between years resulting in different inflow values from year to year tondu et al 2013 another approach is to apply theoretical modeling based on the craig gordon model which requires knowledge of the isotopic composition of both precipitation and atmospheric moisture craig gordon 1965 to infer inflow values for each lake individually regardless the technique used to calculate inflow values from evapo concentrated lakes most lake water δ2h and δ18o values contain information about both the degree of evaporative enrichment and the inflow isotopic composition thus lake water δ2h and δ18o values can be used to infer past change in precipitation δ2h and δ18o values and evaporation but the influence of both inflow and evaporation also confounds isotopic interpretation examining spatial and temporal variations in lake water δ2h and δ18o values along modern climate gradients can guide interpretations of lake water isotope proxy records in northern fennoscandia holocene changes in lake water derived δ18o and δ2h are often assumed to reflect changes in north atlantic atmospheric and oceanic circulation e g hammarlund et al 2002 rosqvist et al 2007 thienemann et al 2019 the north atlantic is the predominant moisture source but during periods with a more southerly position of the polar front precipitation can originate from arctic air masses rosqvist et al 2007 this is further complicated by the fact that arctic and sub arctic lakes can display a wide range of water isotopic compositions despite similar precipitation input gibson edwards 2002 jonsson et al 2009 cluett thomas 2020 this is because meteoric water inputs are modulated by catchment characteristics and additionally modified by lake water evaporation leng marshall 2004 cluett thomas 2020 lake and catchment morphometry and precipitation amount control the throughflow regime of the lake since these factors govern the lake water residence time jonsson et al 2009 furthermore the travel time of water through surface and groundwater systems and into lakes varies in time and space depending on factors such as catchment size slope soil type and seasonality botter et al 2010 heidbüchel et al 2012 jutebring sterte et al 2021 lakes with wetland dominated catchments generally have shorter residence times and lower evaporation to inflow e i ratios gibson et al 2002 to make inferences about past climate based on changes in lake water derived δ18o and δ2h we therefore need to understand both the regional climate and local hydrology jonsson et al 2009 jones et al 2016 cluett thomas 2020 jonsson et al 2009 measured the water isotopic composition of 11 lakes close to abisko in northwestern sweden and found that lakes in this region are mainly recharged by precipitation and shallow groundwater with little influence of evaporation they also demonstrated that the lake water isotopic composition varies on a seasonal basis and that lakes with short residence time 6 months are more sensitive to seasonal changes whereas lakes with longer residence times 6 months have lake water isotopic compositions closer to mean annual precipitation balascio et al 2018 measured modern lake water isotopic composition of 15 lakes along a transect from near tromsø in norway to the finnish swedish border the lakes displayed decreasing isotopic values moving inland from the coast and most of them showed little influence of evaporation on western greenland a recent study of 140 lakes along an aridity gradient between the labrador sea and the greenland ice sheet margin demonstrated that lake water δ18o and δ2h are impacted by inflow isotopic composition and catchment integrated evaporation in all lakes but that the relative importance of those two variables in a given lake depends on climate and lake and catchment morphometry cluett thomas 2020 here we investigate the water isotopic composition of lakes across arctic and sub arctic fennoscandia norway finland and sweden to better constrain the influence of inflow isotopic composition and seasonality on the lake water isotopic composition throughout this region we target lakes across a 460 km long climatic gradient to explore the relative importance of inflow values and evaporative enrichment and consider the interannual variability by comparing the isotopic composition from lakes sampled in several years by identifying modern controls on the lake water isotopic composition we aim to evaluate the sensitivity of lake water to changes in these hydrological and climate processes this information is crucial to identify lakes that have the potential to accurately record the aspect of the water cycle we are interested in and to make solid proxy interpretations 2 regional setting the study area spans from the north atlantic ocean in

of the lakes in the region owe their existence to the advances and retreats of the ice sheet and glaciers during the last glacial interglacial cycle brosius et al 2021 lakes formed in depressions carved by the ice itself some were dammed by glacial deposits and still others are kettles formed due to melting of dead ice these processes combined resulted in a landscape with numerous lakes with diverse morphometrics many lakes and ponds are also associated with the minerotrophic aapa mires characteristic for the area ruuhijärvi 1983 these types of mire complexes form in flat areas with high precipitation and low evaporation seppä 2002 the water in the lakes can reflect different precipitation seasonality depending on duration of lake ice cover governing the amount of snowmelt bypass i e

weyhenmeyer et al 2004 modulated by regional atmospheric circulation blenckner et al 2004 small and shallow lakes generally freeze over earlier than large and deep lakes but lake size has less influence on the break up dates korhonen 2006 most of the study area lies in the middle and northern boreal zones with areas above the tree line classified as alpine moen 1998 the middle boreal zone is characterized by coniferous forest and mires dominating the southern part of the study area and found in the lowlands along parts of the norwegian coast deciduous trees are also common the central part of the study area belongs to the northern boreal zone characterized by birch forests low growing coniferous forest and mires in mountainous areas the northern boreal zone transitions into tundra the low alpine areas are characterized by continuous cover of dwarf shrubs and mires whereas grasses sedges mosses lichens and forbs dominate the mid alpine zone at higher elevations the high alpine zone the vegetation cover is sparse plant cover can affect runoff into lakes and therefore the seasonal lake water inflow values gibson edwards 2002 the topography contributes to a strong hydroclimate gradient with the scandinavian mountains acting as a barrier for air masses from the north atlantic the study region is located in the polar front zone where dynamic low pressure systems bringing warm moist air masses from the atlantic meet dry cool air from the arctic the prevailing westerly winds bring the humid atlantic air onshore and precipitation amounts are highest along the southwestern coast due to orographic lift where the westerlies first meet the mountains hanssen bauer and førland 2000 most of the moisture falls on the windward side of the mountains sheltering the leeward side of the mountains from precipitation uvo 2003 the west coast experiences mild winters and cool summers whereas the climate in the interior is more continental with colder winters and warmer summers fig

also strongly influenced by the north atlantic oscillation nao controlling the strength of the westerlies hurrell 1995 uvo 2003 irannezhad et al 2014 during times of positive nao index large atmospheric pressure difference between the iceland low and the azores high the north atlantic storm track shifts northwards increasing the moisture flux to scandinavia hurrell 1995 marshall et al 2001 uvo 2003 the nao is closely related to the arctic oscillation ao which is linked to the polar low pressure system also known as the polar vortex thompson wallace 1998 in the winter of 2019 2020 january march which preceded one of our sampling campaigns an exceptionally strong stratospheric polar vortex related to extreme ao conditions lower than average air pressure over the arctic and higher than average pressure over the northern atlantic and pacific oceans caused strong positive temperature warmer and precipitation wetter anomalies the highest precipitation anomalies were observed between 60 and 70 n greatly affecting the norwegian coast lawrence et al 2020 in contrast some extreme snowfall events can be attributed to cold air outbreaks during strongly negative nao and ao when dry polar air from sea ice covered areas moves in over a relatively warm ocean creating large sea air heat and moisture exchange shapiro et al 1987 papritz sodemann 2018 one example of an event like this occurred in february 2018 when anomalously high temperatures and low sea ice extent in the barents sea caused a high net moisture flux to the atmosphere and extreme snowfall over northern europe bailey et al 2021 in summer the atmospheric circulation patterns are generally not as strong and more precipitation forms due to local convection jaagus 2009 notably a recent pan arctic study of the isotopic composition of summer 2018 rainfall identified precipitation air masses in finland originating from two different transport regimes mellat et al 2021 during nao conditions prevailing westerlies supplied atlantic moisture whereas summer cyclone activity related to a deepening low pressure system over the kara sea caused northerly airflow and moisture transport from the barents sea mellat et al 2021 these seasonal and synoptic changes in source impact the precipitation isotopic composition in this region see section 2 1 at the meteorological station in tromsø 69 65 n

these sites located on the eastern side of the scandinavian mountains fig 1 rovaniemi is farther from the north atlantic ocean but experiences a warmer and wetter climate than naimakka perhaps due to its proximity to the bothnian bay significant differences in precipitation amount between the coastal and inland sites occur in fall and winter fig 2e this is the season when the relative temperature difference between warm ocean and cold land is greatest causing high precipitation amounts at coastal locations such as tromsø in rovaniemi and naimakka the relative humidity is high during the fall

summer in july 2018 we sampled lakes in the coastal tromsø area n 30 and at the end of june 2019 along the north norwegian coast n 9 the july 2019 and 2020 field campaigns targeted lakes n 35 and n 68

spans c 460 km with lakes spanning elevations from close to sea level in nw and se up to c 560 m a s l close to the tripoint between norway finland and sweden fig 1c we also collected samples from the muonio and torne rivers two rivers forming the border between sweden and finland and the bothnian bay to evaluate the interannual variability we sampled 12 of the lakes along the transect and two locations on the muonio river for two consecutive years furthermore 11 of the transect lakes were sampled in july 2013 by balascio et al 2018 and five have been sampled all three years 2013 2019 and

sampled for the first time in 2020 we collected the samples from the shoreline approximately 10 cm below the lake surface to avoid evaporatively enriched water and stored them in 4 ml glass vials with no headspace the vials were sealed with parafilm to prevent evaporation during transportation and storage precipitation samples were collected in tromsø 69 68 n 18 96 e 73 m a s l from september 6

cylinder and solid precipitation from the 4 inch cylinder the samples were transferred to 4 ml glass vials sealed with parafilm and kept at 4 c until analysis frozen samples were brought inside and melted in a sealed container at room temperature before transfer prior to analysis all samples lake water and precipitation were filtered through a 0 2 μm ptfe filter the lake water samples collected

energy agency iaea a memory correction was applied following van geldern barth 2012 average standard deviations of replicate measurements were 0 08 and 0 02 for δ2h and δ18o respectively for lake water samples collected in 2020 and for all precipitation samples δ2h and δ18o were measured on a picarro l2140 i ws crds with a a0211 vaporizer and an a0325 autosampler at the facility for advanced isotopic research and monitoring of weather climate and biogeochemical cycling farlab university of bergen norway each sample was measured 12 times and the reported values are averaged over the last

and δ18o values for the evapo concentrated transect lakes we applied the bayesian mwl source implementation method by bowen et al 2018 this method allows the user to supply a mwl equation and a hypothesized lel slope each with confidence intervals since the lmwls in naimakka and rovaniemi are parallel to and have similar intercepts as the gmwl fig 3 we used the default mwl equation provided with the model which is a re calibrated gmwl δ2h 8 01 δ18o 9 57 n 80 672 bowen et al 2018 the gmwl has much less uncertainty than the lmwls which are constrained by only hundreds of data points to allow for interannual comparison we based the lel estimations on linear regression using the isotopic composition of lakes sampled in both 2019 and 2020 n 12 to run the model we supplied the estimated lel slope for each subset 4 82 and 5 18 for 2019 and 2020 respectively with a standard deviation of 0 5 as suggested by bowen et al 2018 lake water δ2h and δ18o with uncertainties and covariance 0 95 and the number of iterations 10 000 we acknowledge the assumptions involved in a regression based approach for lel slope estimation but consider the supplied lel slopes to be a good starting estimate because they agree with theoretical lel slope values 5 modeled by gibson et al 2008 given uncertainties in the lel regression approach we do not interpret interannual or spatial differences in lels and instead use them as a guide to infer whether lakes have experienced evaporative enrichment we present modeled mean source water values hereafter referred to as inferred inflow δ2h δ2hi for the discussion where we compare the seasonality of inflow between coastal and transect lakes we include only the coastal lakes that are through flowing as lake water δ2h δ2hl in these lakes is not significantly affected by evaporative enrichment and therefore equal to δ2hi we exclude small isolated coastal basins since we do not have a well constrained estimate of the lel by the coast 4 results 4 1 lake water isotopic composition the lake water surface samples from 2018 to 2020 span a broad range of isotopic compositions fig 3 generally lakes close to the norwegian atlantic coast lie on or close to the gmwl with a trend toward more 2h depleted values moving inland figs 4 7 this trend is likely controlled by the increasing distance from the coast which is likely a proxy for the degree of distillation resulting from air masses advecting over the mountain peaks fig 5a and 7 the lake elevation which is often below the highest mountain peaks in the region fig 5b is less important than the elevation of the mountains over which the moisture has to pass along its transport path fig 7 in the following paragraphs we present the measured lake water δ2h and δ18o values starting with the coastal lakes followed by the transect lakes all lakes along the outermost coast plot in the upper right corner of the co isotope plot fig 3 in 2018 δ2h and δ18o of 30 coastal lakes ranged from 91 43 to 57 82 median 74 72 8 36 1σ and 12 85 to 7 48 median 10 64 1 23 respectively deuterium excess ranged from 3 00 to 14 37 median 9 10 3 59 in 2019 δ2h and δ18o of 11 coastal lakes ranged from 76 84 to 57 22 median 63 69 7 11 and 11 27 to 8 02 median 9 19 0 88 respectively for these lakes d excess ranged from 2 52 to 15 12 median 9 85 4 20 δ2h and δ18o of six coastal lakes sampled in 2020 ranged from 79 40 to 66 10 median 68 05 4 85 and 11 83 to 9 68 median 10 07 0 78 respectively deuterium excess ranged from 11 30 to 15 20 median 12 65 1 49 for lakes sampled along the nw se transect in 2019 n 35 δ2h and δ18o ranged from 105 04 to 84 49 median 95 05 5 82 and 14 22 to 9 50 median 12 44 1 32 respectively figs 3 7 deuterium excess of these lakes ranged from 8 47 to 10 28 median 3 55 4 97 for transect lakes sampled in 2020 n 68 δ2h and δ18o ranged from 112 80 to 75 00 median 95 75 9 35 and 15 20 to 9 19 median 12 43 1 51 respectively deuterium excess ranged from 8 40 to 11 80 median 3 25 3

similar interannual variability fig 6b and 8 samples collected in 2020 were 2h depleted relative to samples collected from the same lakes in 2019 fig 6b and 8 but had similar d excess both years the average offset 2020 minus 2019 was 8 43 for δ2h and 0 90 for d excess one large lake kilpisjärvi 69 05 n 20 79 e 37 km2 was slightly 2h enriched in 2020 compared to 2019 with an offset of 2 12 for δ2h and 0 66 for d excess fig 8 a applying linear regression fits to these 12 lakes resulted in lels with the equations δ2h 4 82 δ18o 35 58 and δ2h 5 18 δ18o 33 27 for 2019 and 2020 respectively fig 6b two locations along the muonio river exhibited similar interannual variation as the lakes fig 6b indicating different inflow values in 2019 and 2020 in 2019 the river water had δ2h of 98 62 and 99 24 respectively in 2020 the same two sites along the river had δ2h of 103 50 and 104 90 resulting in an average offset of 5 27 the average offset for d excess was 0 69 one sample collected from the bothnian bay in 2020 had δ2h and δ18o of 105 60 and 14 00 respectively reflecting the high river runoff to this northernmost part of the baltic sea figs 3 4 and 6 the four northernmost lakes in the transect located in skibotn fig 1b had relatively enriched δ2h and δ18o values compared to the rest of the transect lakes figs 4 8 and s1 δ2h and δ18o ranged from 79 80 to 75 00 median 77 45 1 70 and from 10 40 to 9 84 median 9 97 0 22 respectively deuterium excess ranged from 1 20 to 4 30 median 3 10 1 13 these four lakes are located within 9 km from the lyngen fjord and could therefore be considered coastal figs 1 and 4 however there is a strong rain shadow effect in skibotn where the mean annual precipitation is 465 mm met norway 2021 compared to 1091 mm in tromsø located on the other side of the lyngen alps fig 1c c 60 km northwest of skibotn for lakes by the coast and along the beginning of the transect c 200 km from the north atlantic there is a significant p 0 001 trend toward more 2h depleted lakes moving away from the coast whereas farther inland this trend is still significant p 0 001 though reversed fig 5a δ2h also decreases with elevation fig 5b this trend is significant for the transect lakes p 0 05 and p 0 001 in 2019 and 2020 respectively but not for the coastal lakes considering the strong correlation between δ2h and δ18o for both coastal r 2 0 84 and transect r 2 0 92 lake samples we assume that trends in δ18o follow δ2h and hereafter primarily focus on δ2h and d excess 4 2 inferred inflow δ2h values the conventional lel mwl intersection approach yielded δ2hi values for the transect lakes of 104 78 and 112 90 in 2019 and 2020 respectively bayesian inflow modeling which we did for all 91 transect lakes yielded δ2hi ranging from 116 87 to 106 57 median 112 72 2 57 in 2019 and 128 27 to 94 08 median 115 75 7 53 in 2020 this is on average 18 27 2019 and 20 55 2020 more 2h depleted than measured lake water δ2h fig 7 the 90 confidence intervals for δ2hi ranged from 148 44 to 111 52 for the lower bound and from 118 11 to 83 00 for the upper bound with an average of 132 30 and 104 26 respectively for comparison δ2hl for the coastal lakes ranged from 91 43 to 57 82 median 74 72 8 36 in 2018 76 84 to 57 22 median 63 69 7 11 in 2019 and from 79 40 to 66 10 median 68 05 4 85 in 2020 in the area with lakes sampled in both 2019 and 2020 320 km from the north atlantic δ2hi values were 2h depleted in 2020 compared to in 2019 for the 12 resampled lakes δ2hi ranged from 116 72 to 106 57 median 113 79 2 97 in 2019 and 128 27 to 110 21 median 125 67 4 87 in 2020 resulting in an average offset of 10 68 fig 7 kilpisjärvi had a similar but slightly more negative inferred δ2hi value in 2019 110 30 compared to 2020 110 21 with an offset of 0 09 in 2020 the four lakes in skibotn had δ2hi values from 101 06 to 94 08 median 99 27 2 69 comparable to coastal δ2hl whereas the rest of the transect lakes had δ2hi ranging from 128 27 to 102 94 median 116 72 6 23 moving inland δ2hi decreased rapidly in the first c 160 km along the transect after which δ2hi stayed relatively stable with a slightly increasing trend towards the bothnian bay generally lakes closer to the north atlantic had δ2hl closer to inferred δ2hi for through flowing lakes δ2hl δ2hi increased moving southeast along the transect 1 53 per 100 km and closed basins had the largest offsets between δ2hl and δ2hi fig 7c 5 discussion lake water isotopes in our study area display mainly two kinds of variability caused by differences in 1 inflow value moving along the mwl and 2 evaporation moving below the mwl fig 3 in most cases lake water inflow values reflect a mixture of sources with different isotopic composition e g summer and winter runoff groundwater the seasonality of lake water is primarily governed by the lake water residence time since this determines the proportion of summer and winter precipitation in the lake jonsson et al 2009 the position of a lake along the mwl and its relation to local precipitation isotopic composition can thus give information about lake water biases toward summer or winter season precipitation in δ2h δ18o space lakes experiencing evaporative enrichment decreasing d excess plot below the mwl and along lels in the following sections we discuss the sensitivity of modern lake water δ2h along the climate gradient to differences in inflow isotopic composition and evaporation how these two controls vary in time and space and why this variability needs to be considered when inferring lake water isotope proxy records 5 1 regional variability in lake water δ2h and inferred inflow δ2h 5 1 1 coastal lakes the strong correlation between increasing distance from the coast and decreasing δ2hl r 2 0 90 p 0 001 fig 5a for the lakes closest to the coast c 200 km both coastal and the northernmost part of the transect suggests that distillation during atmospheric moisture transport prior to precipitation is the most important control on δ2hl for coastal lakes in this area δ2h and δ18o decrease by c 57 and 6 8 over 200 km or 28 and 3 4 per 100 km respectively fig 5a in the pacific northwest usa mountainous but drier than coastal norway the δ18o isotopic gradient is 1 2 per 100 km welker 2000 and in the sierra nevada usa wet year round most precipitation in winter some mountains 5 per 100 km ingraham taylor 1991 across the european plain from mild and wet coastal ireland to the continental foothills of the ural mountains the gradient is 0 2 per 100 km rozanski et al 1993 this means that our gradient is within ranges found elsewhere and most similar to gradients in similar environments wet mountainous coastal the least 2h depleted lakes are the ones at the northern coast and the outermost coast to the west of tromsø fig 4 since the transport from the source is shorter and there is not much rain out prior to precipitation three lakes in kirkenes are slightly 2h depleted compared to the other lakes at the outermost coast fig 1b and 4 none of these lakes have distinct outflows and relatively low d excess supplementary fig s1 suggests they are likely experiencing evaporative enrichment they may also receive source water with a slightly different isotopic signal being located near the barents sea lakes near tromsø are relatively 2h enriched compared to lakes slightly farther from the coast fig 4 in the coastal region most of the large through flowing lakes plot close to the mwl whereas some smaller lakes with low or unknown throughflow and long residence times fall below the mwl being more affected by evaporation fig 3 a couple of large through flowing lakes with large mountainous catchments plot above the mwl and close to tromsø amount weighted winter precipitation e g laksvatnet fig 4a and e 8 suggesting a longer response time and that the depleted meltwater from snow has not yet been flushed through in early july some of the local variability in coastal lake water δ2h can also be explained by differences in elevation fig 5b likely reflecting heterogeneous airflow patterns with fjords funneling onshore winds and mountains causing orographic precipitation the mountains cause the air masses to rise as they move inland from tromsø causing rainout and more negative δ2h values figs 4 5 and 7 lakes at a given distance from the coast have similar isotope values despite differences in elevation fig 5a b this is likely because precipitation at a given location forms at the same elevation in the atmosphere and that elevation rises over the mountains moving inland three high elevation coastal lakes 460 m a s l have δ2hl values comparable to other coastal lakes despite their high elevation fig 5b they have high d excess average 14 2 0 3 and plot above the mwl suggesting that their isotopic signals are biased toward winter precipitation in tromsø precipitation δ2h is relatively enriched compared to the more inland stations and does not show a strong seasonality in contrast d excess is significantly higher in fall and winter than in summer figs 2 and 3 due to kinetic fractionation effects when snow forms in mixed phase clouds vapor supersaturated over ice jouzel merlivat 1984 it is common for mountain lakes to receive most precipitation as snowfall and for their catchments to experience late snowmelt explaining the high d excess lake water values furthermore two of the lakes have small niche glaciers in their catchments contributing glacial meltwater thus our dataset suggests that coastal lakes are primarily influenced by varying degrees of distillation during atmospheric moisture transport precipitation amount and lake and catchment morphometry the latter two determining the lake water residence time 5 1 2 transect lakes in contrast to the coastal lakes most of the transect lakes experience more evaporative enrichment plotting below the mwl and along a lel figs 3 and 6 lake surface water from oikojärvi located close to naimakka st amour 2009 and guossajavri 125 km sw of our transect rosqvist et al 2013 fig 1b sampled between 2002 and 2008 fall along similar lels suggesting similar evaporation patterns on a regional scale and between years figs 6 and 8 the north atlantic is still the main moisture source so precipitation δ2h and as a result lake water δ2h becomes more and more depleted the first c 160 km along the transect reflecting rayleigh distillation during moisture transport figs 4 7 on the southeastern side of the mountains where the relief changes from highlands with incised valleys to a gently sloping plain with few hills there is a larger spread in δ2hl fig 7a and larger and more variable offsets between δ2hl and δ2hi fig 7c this coincides with the northern boundary of the northern aapa mire zone where large branched mire systems are common ruuhijärvi 1983 although lakes in wetland dominated catchments tend to have low e i gibson et al 2002 many of the lakes in this area are evaporatively enriched plotting on a lel and having low d excess figs 3 6 and 7d hydrologically closed basins lack of clear surface flow and or only seasonal connection by small streams or wetland areas may make these lakes susceptible to evaporation furthermore in continental regions at high latitudes seasonally arid conditions can increase the evaporative enrichment during the thaw season gibson et al 2005 smaller inter lake variation in δ2hi than in δ2hl fig 7a c suggests that most lakes have similar inflow seasonality and sources whereas evaporation indicated by decreasing d excess 0 92 per 100 km fig 7d increases moving southeast moreover some lakes possibly have δ2hl values influenced by factors in addition to evaporative enrichment some of the lakes might be groundwater fed since till and glaciofluvial aquifers are common in this region kortelainen karhu 2004 however there are no significant differences between the isotopic composition of precipitation and shallow groundwater till aquifers in northern finland and sweden kortelainen karhu 2004 both follow the same seasonal cycle with most enriched values in late fall and most depleted values after snowmelt we do therefore not expect shallow groundwater recharge to the lakes to significantly alter δ2hl lakes on the southeastern side of the scandinavian mountains most likely also receive precipitation from other moisture sources such as the baltic region and eurasia these sources are more depleted schmidt et al 1999 bailey et al 2021 but the travel distance may be shorter potentially resulting in less distillation and precipitation that is relatively enriched compared to atlantic moisture a phenomenon also observed in precipitation events in arctic alaska putman et al 2017 in summer precipitation can be induced by local convection and less influenced by atmospheric circulation jaagus 2009 local moisture could in this way at least partly explain the slightly enriched δ2hl of lakes closest to the bothnian bay fig 7a furthermore transpiration another process most important in summer can partly compensate for isotopic depletion caused by distillation during moisture transport by recycling soil moisture without fractionation rozanski et al 1982 the relative contribution of moisture from different source regions and the resulting isotopic compositions of precipitation can be assessed on an event basis at a given station bailey et al 2021 mellat et al 2021 but we do not have any data on this over longer time scales i e covering our study period or know how it varies within our study region most likely the isotopic composition of precipitation along our transect and therefore lake water inflow is controlled by a combination of different moisture source regions local convection and evapotranspiration 5 1 3 lake location and inflow seasonality comparing δ2hi to precipitation δ2h data from tromsø naimakka and rovaniemi as well as oipc modeled precipitation δ2h bowen 2021 suggests that winter precipitation is more important for inland lakes whereas coastal lakes tend to be summer biased or have an isotopic composition close to mean annual precipitation δ2h fig 7b a similar trend is seen on western greenland likely reflecting lake water inflow seasonality along an aridity gradient cluett thomas 2020 in our study area the inland region normally receives a greater fraction of the annual precipitation during the summer months fig 2 this lake water bias towards winter precipitation for inland lakes is likely due to lower relative humidity and higher evapotranspiration at inland sites in summer fig 2 even if a greater fraction of total precipitation falls in summer bowen et al 2018 that coastal lakes appear to be summer biased is somewhat unexpected considering that tromsø receives more winter precipitation than naimakka and rovaniemi figs 2 and 9d e oipc modeled precipitation δ2h values are based on interpolation using gnip values they are therefore biased towards the nearest gnip stations i e naimakka and rovaniemi which are more continental and experience a larger seasonality than tromsø figs 2 and 3 we compare the oipc values with precipitation samples collected in tromsø in 2019 2021 and can confirm that the modeled coastal values are indeed too depleted compared to our new precipitation isotope dataset fig 7a b however it cannot be excluded that the 2h depleted winter isotopes might have been efficiently flushed from some coastal lakes with short residence times especially considering the high precipitation amounts in june 2018 and 2019 fig 9 this suggests that lakes in this region likely reflect a range of summer to mean annual to winter biased precipitation δ2h figs 3 and 7 5 2 lake water δ2h and inferred inflow δ2h changes over time 5 2 1 interannual variability sampling campaigns concentrated in the first week of july in 2018 2019 and 2020 allowed us to get an insight into the interannual variability in δ2hl and δ2hi we focus this comparison on the transect lakes since we sampled coastal lakes in different locations each year i e in the tromsø area vs along the northern coast only three coastal lakes were sampled two or three of these years and they follow similar interannual patterns as the transect lakes fig 8a we sampled the transect lakes in 2019 and 2020 and extended the transect farther southeast in 2020 fig 7 twelve transect lakes sampled in both years had more 2h depleted δ2hl in 2020 and a lel intersecting the mwl at a more depleted value compared to 2019 fig 6b and 7a suggesting more depleted inflow water in 2020 than in 2019 this is supported by more depleted modeled δ2hi in 2020 compared to in 2019 fig 7b we suggest that the more 2h depleted values in 2020 were a response to 1 more precipitation in winter 2019 2020 than in 2018 2019 fig 9d e 2 later spring melt in 2020 than 2019 fig 9e resulting in less time prior to our july sampling for 2h enriched summer precipitation to flush the 2h depleted winter melt out of the lakes and or 3 more may june rainfall in 2019 than in 2020 fig 9d contributing to higher snowmelt bypass in 2019 i e more snow melting off the high elevation portions landscape before the lakes become ice free in the first half of june which would remove 2h depleted winter precipitation from the catchment without entering the lake the high precipitation amounts in january march 2020 were associated with extreme ao conditions and an exceptionally strong stratospheric polar vortex causing strong winter westerlies that carried greater than average amounts of moisture from the north atlantic over fennoscandia lawrence et al 2020 fig 9a d e an additional explanation for 2h depleted lake inflow values in 2020 could be a change in moisture source surface waters in the baltic sea are relatively 18o depleted compared to the north atlantic schmidt et al 1999 and a greater influence of baltic moisture to our study area could therefore contribute to more depleted precipitation in winter 2018 2019 most of the bothnian bay was sea ice covered whereas winter 2019 2020 baltic sea sea ice cover set a record for minimum winter extent in the 120 year long measuring period sjöfartsverket smhi 2020a 2020b however predominantly southwesterly winds and pressure systems moving eastward over the baltic sea in both years imply a low impact of baltic sea moisture to our study area during this period some lakes in the area have been sampled in previous studies allowing us to extend our interannual comparison further back in time in 2013 nine of the transect lakes were relatively enriched compared to the same lakes sampled in 2019 and or 2020 balascio et al 2018 fig 6a and 8 the interannual changes in lake water isotopic composition were parallel to the mwl suggesting that the lakes had more 2h enriched inflow water in 2013 than in 2019 and 2020 but that all years had a similar influence of evaporation the hydrological year 2012 2013 was relatively dry compared to 2018 2019 and 2019 2020 especially in tromsø fig 9d e however june and july 2013 were wet fig 9d and the lakes were sampled several weeks later than in 2019 and 2020 july 26 2013 n balascio personal communication suggesting that the relatively enriched lake water values reflect greater summer precipitation inflow to the lakes in 2013 two lakes close to naimakka oikojärvi and keitjoru that were sampled by st amour 2009 in july 2003 2004 and 2006 displayed a similar magnitude of interannual variability to the lakes in our dataset fig 8a the oikojärvi samples from july 2004 and 2006 were close to the mwl whereas the 2003 sample was evaporatively enriched along a lel perhaps due to exceptional dryness that year as suggested by st amour 2009 5 2 2 seasonal variability the lake water isotopic composition also follows a seasonal cycle st amour 2009 collected monthly samples excluding february and december from the two lakes in naimakka from 2002 to 2005 generally recording lowest values in the beginning of the ice free season due to isotopically depleted snowmelt increasing values over summer due to more enriched inflow isotopic composition and or evaporative enrichment and high and relatively stable composition during the ice cover season fig 8b guossajavri northern sweden showed a similar trend in 2007 and 2008 with the lake moving up along the lel during the summer months and being recharged in winter rosqvist et al 2013 fig 8b this is in agreement with other lakes in northern sweden jonsson et al 2009 and elsewhere in the arctic leng anderson 2003 tondu et al 2013 we sampled two lakes in tromsø in march june july and or september in 2018 2020 except for a low march value the seasonal isotope patterns in these lakes are similar to interannual patterns in all the lakes isotope values tend to move parallel to the mwl implying changes in inflow isotopic composition rather than changes in evaporation although we do not have samples to examine seasonal variability in the transect lakes given the similarities in interannual variability between the coast and transect we hypothesize the transect lakes experience similar seasonal changes in inflow isotopic composition with constant influence of evaporative enrichment 5 3 implications for precipitation proxy reconstructions interpreting isotope proxy records often assumes that for a given record the control on the lake water isotopic variability is constant through time we have demonstrated that lakes in this region display variable sensitivity to changes in inflow precipitation isotopic composition and to evaporative enrichment and that these controls vary in both time and space resolving these controls on modern lake water isotopes is important for making quantitative paleoclimate inferences depending on what aspect of the hydrological cycle we aim to reconstruct e g atmospheric circulation precipitation amount or seasonality moisture balance we can target different lakes in parts of our study area modern precipitation isotopes have strong seasonal variability figs 2 and 7 and if this signal is preserved in lake sediment proxy records we can use it to reconstruct changes in precipitation seasonality cluett thomas 2020 thomas et al 2020 the seasonality preserved in a proxy record depends on the δ2h or δ18o of source lake or soil water at the time of proxy synthesis which can vary between proxies corcoran et al 2021 lake water isotopic composition and seasonal variability depends on the lake water residence time jonsson et al 2010 tondu et al 2013 ala aho et al 2018 which may also change through time previous paleoclimate work in northern fennoscandia suggests that changes in holocene precipitation isotopes are strongly linked to changes in air temperature and air mass sources lacustrine carbonates biogenic silica and cellulose from non evaporated lakes in northern sweden have been used to reconstruct past changes in lake water δ18o and precipitation shemesh et al 2001 hammarlund et al 2002 rosqvist et al 2004 2007 2013 st amour 2009 jonsson et al 2010 in most of these studies depleted summer lake water δ18o was inferred to reflect increased influence of arctic air masses furthermore rosqvist et al 2013 suggested that periods of relatively high δ18odiatom reflect a dominance of summer precipitation related to a positive ao index whereas low δ18odiatom reflects dominant winter precipitation due to positive nao studying modern conditions can aid proxy interpretations since it allows us to directly link isotopic changes to observations of atmospheric circulation change arctic ocean and baltic sea surface waters are relatively depleted compared to north atlantic moisture legrande schmidt 2006 bonne et al 2019 suggesting that depleted precipitation isotopes and thereby lake water isotopes may reflect a change to dominance of arctic or baltic air masses however this will depend on the location of the lake and the moisture travel distance atlantic moisture which is originally less depleted that has been transported a long distance may have experienced more distillation than more locally derived moisture with a more depleted starting isotopic composition and therefore also be relatively depleted putman et al 2017 cluett et al 2021 our 2h depleted lake water values in 2020 were likely not caused by a shift in moisture source region but by high winter precipitation amounts associated with ao conditions and an increase in north atlantic moisture lawrence et al 2020 greater than average winter precipitation amounts over fennoscandia can result from both extremely positive and negative winter ao conditions although from different moisture sources north atlantic vs barents sea lawrence et al 2020 bailey et al 2021 complicating things further modern moisture from the barents sea has an isotopic composition comparable to north atlantic moisture due to increased strength of the north atlantic current bailey et al 2021 if conditions were similar in the past the atlantic and barents sea moisture sources would be difficult to distinguish from one another in proxy records our lake water isotope observations imply that seasonal changes in precipitation amounts need to be taken into account when inferring atmospheric circulation from a proxy record in this region and that changes in precipitation isotope values can be a result of a change in precipitation seasonality moisture source or a combination of both for reconstructions of atmospheric circulation and precipitation we should target lakes that are minimally impacted by evaporative enrichment since evaporation overprints the precipitation signal in our dataset most lakes 100 km from the coast have low d excess values suggesting that evaporative enrichment affects them to some degree regardless of their throughflow regime figs 3 6a and 7 all transect lakes appear to fall on similar lels but with slope and intercept varying from year to year depending on seasonality fig 6 on interannual and seasonal timescales changes in inflow appear to have a larger impact than evaporation with isotope values moving along the mwl fig 8 on longer timescales evaporation may be more important making it difficult to disentangle how much of the variability derives from each process i e inflow vs evaporation hence we suggest that through flowing coastal lakes are better targets for precipitation reconstructions since changes in their lake water isotopic composition are more likely to primarily reflect changes in the inflow for evapo concentrated lakes there are a few possible approaches to separate the precipitation from the evaporation signal including 1 comparing two lakes with contrasting residence times anderson et al 2001 2 comparing terrestrial and aquatic leaf waxes in the same lake rach et al 2017 or 3 measuring both δ2h and δ18o in the same records gibson et al 2005 for the first approach one needs to identify a non evaporated lake with short residence time low δ2hl δ2hi and one evaporated lake with longer residence time high δ2hl δ2hi anderson et al 2001 moreover the lakes must receive source water reflecting the same precipitation seasonality and evaporation should be the only factor that differs between the two the offset between δ2hl and δ2hi for our transect lakes is 10 independent of throughflow suggesting that it will be difficult to identify an unevaporated lake in this region which would be needed for this approach using the second approach one compares terrestrial and aquatic leaf wax δ2h in the same record which have source water representing the same seasonality in areas where terrestrial plant source water is evaporatively enriched but the aquatic plant source water is not the isotopic difference between the two reflects leaf water evaporative enrichment rach et al 2017 thomas et al 2018 curtin et al 2019 in contrast lake water in arid areas has been suggested to be more evaporatively enriched than terrestrial leaf water meaning that the difference primarily reflects the evaporative enrichment of lake water mügler et al 2008 balascio et al 2013 along our transect both aquatic and terrestrial leaf waxes likely incorporate a signal of evaporative 2h enrichment due to low relative humidity and warm conditions in summer figs 2 and 9b c thus a dual leaf wax approach to separate precipitation and evaporation signals might not be applicable along the transect but may be possible at coastal lakes for the third approach one measures δ2h and δ18o in the same lakes which may allow estimation of past changes in the slope of the lel gibson et al 2005 that could subsequently be used to infer past inflow values theoretically this is possible however it involves many uncertainties first one needs to analyze the same proxies at the same time slice in several lakes second those two proxies one with δ2h and one with δ18o need to reflect the same pool of water for the same window of time in a season moreover one needs to have good constraints on biosynthetic and other fractionation factors brandriss et al 1998 sachse et al 2012 lombino et al 2021 to be able to estimate lake water δ2h and δ18o and directly compare δ2h and δ18o from different proxies corcoran et al 2021 a more recent approach to guide paleoclimate interpretations is to use proxy system modeling which uses modern climate variables as inputs to mathematical descriptions of lake water isotope and energy balance e g prysm2 0 dee et al 2018 by conducting sensitivity tests in which we iteratively change values of one or more climate parameters e g lower relative humidity more winter precipitation we can quantify the parameter or combination of parameters that could explain changes recorded in lake water isotope proxies for lakes in our transect we could for example focus on variables that affect the lake water inflow isotopic signal and amount of evaporative enrichment to assess the sensitivity of the lake water isotopic composition to these variables if we have an estimate of how a change in moisture source would affect the precipitation isotopes we can modify the inflow isotope value in the model to see how this would impact the lake water isotope value one way to simulate how a shift in moisture source would influence the lake water inflow value is to use a one dimensional rayleigh type distillation model along a theoretical trajectory sodemann et al 2008 steen larsen et al 2011 cluett et al 2021 these approaches can provide us with quantitative constraints on past climate changes when interpreting lake water derived isotope proxy data from northern fennoscandia we need to consider the magnitude of variability in both inflow isotopic composition and evaporation on the coast inflow causes more variability than evaporation considering the variability among the transect lakes the ranges for δ2hi and δ2hl are similar suggesting that inflow and evaporation might be equally important interannual variability is largely due to changes in inflow isotopic composition however suggesting the importance of inflow isotopic composition even in lakes that are strongly influenced by evaporation therefore we recommend targeting through flowing lakes by the coast for precipitation reconstructions if working with more continental records we need to address the significance of both inflow and evaporation processes importantly our data show that we cannot interpret all isotopic variability in evapo concentrated basins in terms of evaporation as there might also be a substantial variability in inflow isotopic composition through time data availability water isotope data are freely available in the water

3586,high latitude lakes are sensitive to climate change and store information about large scale circulation changes and catchment integrated processes lakes are mainly recharged by meteoric water meaning that some lake sediment proxies may indirectly archive the stable isotopic composition of hydrogen δ2h and oxygen δ18o of past precipitation yet despite similar precipitation input lakes within a region may exhibit a wide range of isotopic values due to the varying influence of inflow seasonality and evaporation moreover the relative sensitivity of each lake to these controls may vary through time something that is difficult to account for here we evaluate the impact of variable inflow δ2h and evaporation on the lake water isotopic composition across northern fennoscandia norway finland and sweden we measured lake water δ2h and δ18o of 135 lakes spanning from the north norwegian coast along a 460 km transect to the bothnian bay sampled from 2018 to 2020 our data show that both coastal and inland lakes are sensitive to distillation during moisture transport and that lakes farther from the atlantic ocean are additionally impacted by evaporation we estimated the isotopic composition of lake water inflow values for evapo concentrated transect lakes δ2hi using a bayesian method resampled transect lakes had more depleted δ2hi in 2020 than in 2019 indicating either that precipitation was 2h depleted or that more winter precipitation contributed inflow to the lakes in 2020 compared to in 2019 we suggest that the more 2h depleted values in 2020 were a response to a snow rich winter associated with extremely positive arctic oscillation ao conditions and increased moisture supply from the north atlantic we find evidence that lake water isotopic variability in this region reflects a combination of seasonal precipitation changes associated with atmospheric circulation changes and catchment integrated evaporation careful consideration of the variable sensitivity to these processes is essential when making inferences about past climate based on lake water isotope proxies keywords lake water isotopes precipitation isotopes moisture source evaporation seasonality proxy interpretation 1 introduction amplified warming in the northern high latitudes is predicted to cause an intensification of the hydrological cycle rawlins et al 2010 collins et al 2013 bintanja selten 2014 bintanja et al 2020 these changes affect both terrestrial and ocean freshwater budgets and have great cryospheric and ecological impact bring et al 2016 vihma et al 2016 wrona et al 2016 arctic precipitation change is caused by two main mechanisms with different seasonal imprints increased local evaporation mainly occurs in fall and winter due to accelerated sea ice loss bintanja selten 2014 bailey et al 2021 in contrast poleward moisture transport is greatest in summer when the meridional temperature and moisture gradients increase the most and continental moisture sources play a significant role vázquez et al 2016 singh et al 2017 furthermore greater interannual variability in the summer moisture influx from extrapolar regions is projected to contribute to increasing interannual variability in arctic precipitation bintanja et al 2020 the projected trends remain uncertain relying on sparse observational data to describe complex spatiotemporal patterns to improve the constraints on long term variability in precipitation and atmospheric circulation we can use lake water derived proxy records sundqvist et al 2014 linderholm et al 2018 stable isotope ratios of oxygen δ18o and hydrogen δ2h in precipitation are frequently used to infer processes in the hydrological cycle due to their sensitivity to changes in atmospheric temperature moisture and circulation dansgaard 1964 rozanski et al 1993 gat 1996 much of the variation in precipitation isotopic composition results from equilibrium fractionation during phase changes e g evaporation condensation and freezing during transport from the moisture source to the precipitation site gat 1996 equilibrium fractionation is highly temperature dependent and therefore varies both spatially and temporally the global average relationship between δ2h and δ18o in meteoric waters is described by the global meteoric water line gmwl defined as δ2h 8 δ18o 10 craig 1961 local meteoric water lines lmwls account for site specific variation in the isotopic composition due to factors including moisture sources transport conditions and seasonality for example in seasonally snowy regions slopes of the lmwls tend to be similar to the gmwl but the intercepts lower than in other regions due to snow formation processes putman et al 2019 the isotopic signal of precipitation can be preserved in climate proxies allowing us to extend our records back beyond the instrumental period in northern fennoscandia the oldest temperature and precipitation amount observations date back to the 1860 s alexandersson 2002 whereas precipitation isotope records are limited to a handful of sites most of them only measuring δ18o covering timespans of less than ten years each and only after 1975 iaea wmo 2019 lakes are excellent archives of past climate change as their isotopic composition often at least partially reflects precipitation isotopes and they contain a wide range of proxies that preserve the lake water isotopic composition in northern fennoscandia reconstructions of holocene precipitation humidity and atmospheric circulation have mainly been based on δ18o from lacustrine carbonates hammarlund et al 2002 rosqvist et al 2007 diatom biogenic silica shemesh et al 2001 rosqvist et al 2004 2013 jonsson et al 2010 and lake sediment cellulose st amour et al 2010 other studies use δ2h of lipid biomarkers to reconstruct different aspects of the water cycle nichols et al 2009 thienemann et al 2019 balascio et al 2020 recent dual biomarker approaches have focused on comparing leaf waxes produced by aquatic and terrestrial plants to reconstruct holocene and last interglacial atmospheric circulation changes precipitation seasonality and summer moisture balance rach et al 2017 thomas et al 2018 2020 curtin et al 2019 kjellman et al 2020 katrantsiotis et al 2021 these approaches rely on the assumption that the aquatic plant biomarkers are minimally impacted by evaporative enrichment this might be true for lakes in regions with positive moisture balance precipitation evaporation but not for lakes in more arid areas cluett thomas 2020 when lakes undergo evapo concentration they will deviate from their starting isotopic compositions along the mwl due to kinetic fractionation and evolve along a local evaporation line lel gat 1996 the slope of the lel is controlled by atmospheric conditions e g temperature relative humidity and the isotopic composition of atmospheric moisture and is usually between 5 and 6 at the mid latitudes and sometimes steeper at high latitudes gibson et al 2008 if the slope of the lel is known it can be used along with the lake water δ2h and δ18o values to calculate the intersection between the lel and the mwl which represents lake water inflow values one common approach to estimate regional lel slopes is to adopt a linear regression fit to a group of lakes within the region clark fritz 1997 this approach assumes that all the isotopic variation is a result of evaporation and that all lakes in a region start with the same source isotopic composition i e the lake inflow value bowen et al 2018 this is seldom true especially for systems with a strong seasonality at high latitudes the relative proportion of isotopically depleted snowfall and isotopically enriched rainfall can change between years resulting in different inflow values from year to year tondu et al 2013 another approach is to apply theoretical modeling based on the craig gordon model which requires knowledge of the isotopic composition of both precipitation and atmospheric moisture craig gordon 1965 to infer inflow values for each lake individually regardless the technique used to calculate inflow values from evapo concentrated lakes most lake water δ2h and δ18o values contain information about both the degree of evaporative enrichment and the inflow isotopic composition thus lake water δ2h and δ18o values can be used to infer past change in precipitation δ2h and δ18o values and evaporation but the influence of both inflow and evaporation also confounds isotopic interpretation examining spatial and temporal variations in lake water δ2h and δ18o values along modern climate gradients can guide interpretations of lake water isotope proxy records in northern fennoscandia holocene changes in lake water derived δ18o and δ2h are often assumed to reflect changes in north atlantic atmospheric and oceanic circulation e g hammarlund et al 2002 rosqvist et al 2007 thienemann et al 2019 the north atlantic is the predominant moisture source but during periods with a more southerly position of the polar front precipitation can originate from arctic air masses rosqvist et al 2007 this is further complicated by the fact that arctic and sub arctic lakes can display a wide range of water isotopic compositions despite similar precipitation input gibson edwards 2002 jonsson et al 2009 cluett thomas 2020 this is because meteoric water inputs are modulated by catchment characteristics and additionally modified by lake water evaporation leng marshall 2004 cluett thomas 2020 lake and catchment morphometry and precipitation amount control the throughflow regime of the lake since these factors govern the lake water residence time jonsson et al 2009 furthermore the travel time of water through surface and groundwater systems and into lakes varies in time and space depending on factors such as catchment size slope soil type and seasonality botter et al 2010 heidbüchel et al 2012 jutebring sterte et al 2021 lakes with wetland dominated catchments generally have shorter residence times and lower evaporation to inflow e i ratios gibson et al 2002 to make inferences about past climate based on changes in lake water derived δ18o and δ2h we therefore need to understand both the regional climate and local hydrology jonsson et al 2009 jones et al 2016 cluett thomas 2020 jonsson et al 2009 measured the water isotopic composition of 11 lakes close to abisko in northwestern sweden and found that lakes in this region are mainly recharged by precipitation and shallow groundwater with little influence of evaporation they also demonstrated that the lake water isotopic composition varies on a seasonal basis and that lakes with short residence time 6 months are more sensitive to seasonal changes whereas lakes with longer residence times 6 months have lake water isotopic compositions closer to mean annual precipitation balascio et al 2018 measured modern lake water isotopic composition of 15 lakes along a transect from near tromsø in norway to the finnish swedish border the lakes displayed decreasing isotopic values moving inland from the coast and most of them showed little influence of evaporation on western greenland a recent study of 140 lakes along an aridity gradient between the labrador sea and the greenland ice sheet margin demonstrated that lake water δ18o and δ2h are impacted by inflow isotopic composition and catchment integrated evaporation in all lakes but that the relative importance of those two variables in a given lake depends on climate and lake and catchment morphometry cluett thomas 2020 here we investigate the water isotopic composition of lakes across arctic and sub arctic fennoscandia norway finland and sweden to better constrain the influence of inflow isotopic composition and seasonality on the lake water isotopic composition throughout this region we target lakes across a 460 km long climatic gradient to explore the relative importance of inflow values and evaporative enrichment and consider the interannual variability by comparing the isotopic composition from lakes sampled in several years by identifying modern controls on the lake water isotopic composition we aim to evaluate the sensitivity of lake water to changes in these hydrological and climate processes this information is crucial to identify lakes that have the potential to accurately record the aspect of the water cycle we are interested in and to make solid proxy interpretations 2 regional setting the study area spans from the north atlantic ocean in

of the lakes in the region owe their existence to the advances and retreats of the ice sheet and glaciers during the last glacial interglacial cycle brosius et al 2021 lakes formed in depressions carved by the ice itself some were dammed by glacial deposits and still others are kettles formed due to melting of dead ice these processes combined resulted in a landscape with numerous lakes with diverse morphometrics many lakes and ponds are also associated with the minerotrophic aapa mires characteristic for the area ruuhijärvi 1983 these types of mire complexes form in flat areas with high precipitation and low evaporation seppä 2002 the water in the lakes can reflect different precipitation seasonality depending on duration of lake ice cover governing the amount of snowmelt bypass i e

weyhenmeyer et al 2004 modulated by regional atmospheric circulation blenckner et al 2004 small and shallow lakes generally freeze over earlier than large and deep lakes but lake size has less influence on the break up dates korhonen 2006 most of the study area lies in the middle and northern boreal zones with areas above the tree line classified as alpine moen 1998 the middle boreal zone is characterized by coniferous forest and mires dominating the southern part of the study area and found in the lowlands along parts of the norwegian coast deciduous trees are also common the central part of the study area belongs to the northern boreal zone characterized by birch forests low growing coniferous forest and mires in mountainous areas the northern boreal zone transitions into tundra the low alpine areas are characterized by continuous cover of dwarf shrubs and mires whereas grasses sedges mosses lichens and forbs dominate the mid alpine zone at higher elevations the high alpine zone the vegetation cover is sparse plant cover can affect runoff into lakes and therefore the seasonal lake water inflow values gibson edwards 2002 the topography contributes to a strong hydroclimate gradient with the scandinavian mountains acting as a barrier for air masses from the north atlantic the study region is located in the polar front zone where dynamic low pressure systems bringing warm moist air masses from the atlantic meet dry cool air from the arctic the prevailing westerly winds bring the humid atlantic air onshore and precipitation amounts are highest along the southwestern coast due to orographic lift where the westerlies first meet the mountains hanssen bauer and førland 2000 most of the moisture falls on the windward side of the mountains sheltering the leeward side of the mountains from precipitation uvo 2003 the west coast experiences mild winters and cool summers whereas the climate in the interior is more continental with colder winters and warmer summers fig

atmospheric pressure difference between the iceland low and the azores high the north atlantic storm track shifts northwards increasing the moisture flux to scandinavia hurrell 1995 marshall et al

january march which preceded one of our sampling campaigns an exceptionally strong stratospheric polar vortex related to extreme ao conditions lower than average air pressure over the arctic and higher than average pressure over the northern atlantic and pacific oceans caused strong positive temperature warmer and precipitation wetter anomalies the highest precipitation anomalies were observed between 60 and 70 n greatly affecting the norwegian coast lawrence et al 2020 in contrast some extreme snowfall events can be attributed to cold air outbreaks during strongly negative nao and ao when dry polar air from sea ice covered areas moves in over a relatively warm ocean creating large sea air heat and moisture exchange shapiro et al 1987 papritz sodemann 2018 one example of an event like this occurred in february 2018 when anomalously high temperatures and low sea ice extent in the barents sea caused a high net moisture flux to the atmosphere and extreme snowfall over northern europe bailey et al 2021 in summer the atmospheric circulation patterns are generally not as strong and more precipitation forms due to local convection jaagus 2009 notably a recent pan arctic study of the isotopic composition of summer 2018 rainfall identified precipitation air masses in finland originating from two different transport regimes mellat et al 2021 during nao conditions prevailing westerlies supplied atlantic moisture whereas summer cyclone activity related to a deepening low pressure system over the kara sea caused northerly airflow and moisture transport from the barents sea mellat et al 2021 these seasonal and synoptic changes in source impact the precipitation isotopic composition in this region see section 2 1 at the meteorological station in tromsø 69 65 n

these sites located on the eastern side of the scandinavian mountains fig 1 rovaniemi is farther from the north atlantic ocean but experiences a warmer and wetter climate than naimakka perhaps due to its proximity to the bothnian bay significant differences in precipitation amount between the coastal and inland sites occur in fall and winter fig 2e this is the season when the relative temperature difference between warm ocean and cold land is greatest causing high precipitation amounts at coastal locations such as tromsø in rovaniemi and naimakka the relative humidity is high during the fall

spans c 460 km with lakes spanning elevations from close to sea level in nw and se up to c 560 m a s l close to the tripoint between norway finland and sweden fig 1c we also collected samples from the muonio and torne rivers two rivers forming the border between sweden and finland and the bothnian bay to evaluate the interannual variability we sampled 12 of the lakes along the transect and two locations on the muonio river for two consecutive years furthermore 11 of the transect lakes were sampled in july 2013 by balascio et al 2018 and five have been sampled all three years 2013 2019 and

and δ18o values for the evapo concentrated transect lakes we applied the bayesian mwl source implementation method by bowen et al 2018 this method allows the user to supply a mwl equation and a hypothesized lel slope each with confidence intervals since the lmwls in naimakka and rovaniemi are parallel to and have similar intercepts as the gmwl fig 3 we used the default mwl equation provided with the model which is a re calibrated gmwl δ2h 8 01 δ18o 9 57 n 80 672 bowen et al 2018 the gmwl has much less uncertainty than the lmwls which are constrained by only hundreds of data points to allow for interannual comparison we based the lel estimations on linear regression using the isotopic composition of lakes sampled in both 2019 and 2020 n 12 to run the model we supplied the estimated lel slope for each subset 4 82 and 5 18 for 2019 and 2020 respectively with a standard deviation of 0 5 as suggested by bowen et al 2018 lake water δ2h and δ18o with uncertainties and covariance 0 95 and the number of iterations 10 000 we acknowledge the assumptions involved in a regression based approach for lel slope estimation but consider the supplied lel slopes to be a good starting estimate because they agree with theoretical lel slope values 5 modeled by gibson et al 2008 given uncertainties in the lel regression approach we do not interpret interannual or spatial differences in lels and instead use them as a guide to infer whether lakes have experienced evaporative enrichment we present modeled mean source water values hereafter referred to as inferred inflow δ2h δ2hi for the discussion where we compare the seasonality of inflow between coastal and transect lakes we include only the coastal lakes that are through flowing as lake water δ2h δ2hl in these lakes is not significantly affected by evaporative enrichment and therefore equal to δ2hi we exclude small isolated coastal basins since we do not have a well constrained estimate of the lel by the coast 4 results 4 1 lake water isotopic composition the lake water surface samples from 2018 to 2020 span a broad range of isotopic compositions fig 3 generally lakes close to the norwegian atlantic coast lie on or close to the gmwl with a trend toward more 2h depleted values moving inland figs 4 7 this trend is likely controlled by the increasing distance from the coast which is likely a proxy for the degree of distillation resulting from air masses advecting over the mountain peaks fig 5a and 7 the lake elevation which is often below the highest mountain peaks in the region fig 5b is less important than the elevation of the mountains over which the moisture has to pass along its transport path fig 7 in the following paragraphs we present the measured lake water δ2h and δ18o values starting with the coastal lakes followed by the transect lakes all lakes along the outermost coast plot in the upper right corner of the co isotope plot fig 3 in 2018 δ2h and δ18o of 30 coastal lakes ranged from 91 43 to 57 82 median 74 72 8 36 1σ and 12 85 to 7 48 median 10 64 1 23 respectively deuterium excess ranged from 3 00 to 14 37 median 9 10 3 59 in 2019 δ2h and δ18o of 11 coastal lakes ranged from 76 84 to 57 22 median 63 69 7 11 and 11 27 to 8 02 median 9 19 0 88 respectively for these lakes d excess ranged from 2 52 to 15 12 median 9 85 4 20 δ2h and δ18o of six coastal lakes sampled in 2020 ranged from 79 40 to 66 10 median 68 05 4 85 and 11 83 to 9 68 median 10 07 0 78 respectively deuterium excess ranged from 11 30 to 15 20 median 12 65 1 49 for lakes sampled along the nw se transect in 2019 n 35 δ2h and δ18o ranged from 105 04 to 84 49 median 95 05 5 82 and 14 22 to 9 50 median 12 44 1 32 respectively figs 3 7 deuterium excess of these lakes ranged from 8 47 to 10 28 median 3 55 4 97 for transect lakes sampled in 2020 n 68 δ2h and δ18o ranged from 112 80 to 75 00 median 95 75 9 35 and 15 20 to 9 19 median 12 43 1 51 respectively deuterium excess ranged from 8 40 to 11 80 median 3 25 3

similar interannual variability fig 6b and 8 samples collected in 2020 were 2h depleted relative to samples collected from the same lakes in 2019 fig 6b and 8 but had similar d excess both years the average offset 2020 minus 2019 was 8 43 for δ2h and 0 90 for d excess one large lake kilpisjärvi 69 05 n 20 79 e 37 km2 was slightly 2h enriched in 2020 compared to 2019 with an offset of 2 12 for δ2h and 0 66 for d excess fig 8 a applying linear regression fits to these 12 lakes resulted in lels with the equations δ2h 4 82 δ18o 35 58 and δ2h 5 18 δ18o 33 27 for 2019 and 2020 respectively fig 6b two locations along the muonio river exhibited similar interannual variation as the lakes fig 6b indicating different inflow values in 2019 and 2020 in 2019 the river water had δ2h of 98 62 and 99 24 respectively in 2020 the same two sites along the river had δ2h of 103 50 and 104 90 resulting in an average offset of 5 27 the average offset for d excess was 0 69 one sample collected from the bothnian bay in 2020 had δ2h and δ18o of 105 60 and 14 00 respectively reflecting the high river runoff to this northernmost part of the baltic sea figs 3 4 and 6 the four northernmost lakes in the transect located in skibotn fig 1b had relatively enriched δ2h and δ18o values compared to the rest of the transect lakes figs 4 8 and s1 δ2h and δ18o ranged from 79 80 to 75 00 median 77 45 1 70 and from 10 40 to 9 84 median 9 97 0 22 respectively deuterium excess ranged from 1 20 to 4 30 median 3 10 1 13 these four lakes are located within 9 km from the lyngen fjord and could therefore be considered coastal figs 1 and 4 however there is a strong rain shadow effect in skibotn where the mean annual precipitation is 465 mm met norway 2021 compared to 1091 mm in tromsø located on the other side of the lyngen alps fig 1c c 60 km northwest of skibotn for lakes by the coast and along the beginning of the transect c 200 km from the north atlantic there is a significant p 0 001 trend toward more 2h depleted lakes moving away from the coast whereas farther inland this trend is still significant p 0 001 though reversed fig 5a δ2h also decreases with elevation fig 5b this trend is significant for the transect lakes p 0 05 and p 0 001 in 2019 and 2020 respectively but not for the coastal lakes considering the strong correlation between δ2h and δ18o for both coastal r 2 0 84 and transect r 2 0 92 lake samples we assume that trends in δ18o follow δ2h and hereafter primarily focus on δ2h and d excess 4 2 inferred inflow δ2h values the conventional lel mwl intersection approach yielded δ2hi values for the transect lakes of 104 78 and 112 90 in 2019 and 2020 respectively bayesian inflow modeling which we did for all 91 transect lakes yielded δ2hi ranging from 116 87 to 106 57 median 112 72 2 57 in 2019 and 128 27 to 94 08 median 115 75 7 53 in 2020 this is on average 18 27 2019 and 20 55 2020 more 2h depleted than measured lake water δ2h fig 7 the 90 confidence intervals for δ2hi ranged from 148 44 to 111 52 for the lower bound and from 118 11 to 83 00 for the upper bound with an average of 132 30 and 104 26 respectively for comparison δ2hl for the coastal lakes ranged from 91 43 to 57 82 median 74 72 8 36 in 2018 76 84 to 57 22 median 63 69 7 11 in 2019 and from 79 40 to 66 10 median 68 05 4 85 in 2020 in the area with lakes sampled in both 2019 and 2020 320 km from the north atlantic δ2hi values were 2h depleted in 2020 compared to in 2019 for the 12 resampled lakes δ2hi ranged from 116 72 to 106 57 median 113 79 2 97 in 2019 and 128 27 to 110 21 median 125 67 4 87 in 2020 resulting in an average offset of 10 68 fig 7 kilpisjärvi had a similar but slightly more negative inferred δ2hi value in 2019 110 30 compared to 2020 110 21 with an offset of 0 09 in 2020 the four lakes in skibotn had δ2hi values from 101 06 to 94 08 median 99 27 2 69 comparable to coastal δ2hl whereas the rest of the transect lakes had δ2hi ranging from 128 27 to 102 94 median 116 72 6 23 moving inland δ2hi decreased rapidly in the first c 160 km along the transect after which δ2hi stayed relatively stable with a slightly increasing trend towards the bothnian bay generally lakes closer to the north atlantic had δ2hl closer to inferred δ2hi for through flowing lakes δ2hl δ2hi increased moving southeast along the transect 1 53 per 100 km and closed basins had the largest offsets between δ2hl and δ2hi fig 7c 5 discussion lake water isotopes in our study area display mainly two kinds of variability caused by differences in 1 inflow value moving along the mwl and 2 evaporation moving below the mwl fig 3 in most cases lake water inflow values reflect a mixture of sources with different isotopic composition e g summer and winter runoff groundwater the seasonality of lake water is primarily governed by the lake water residence time since this determines the proportion of summer and winter precipitation in the lake jonsson et al 2009 the position of a lake along the mwl and its relation to local precipitation isotopic composition can thus give information about lake water biases toward summer or winter season precipitation in δ2h δ18o space lakes experiencing evaporative enrichment decreasing d excess plot below the mwl and along lels in the following sections we discuss the sensitivity of modern lake water δ2h along the climate gradient to differences in inflow isotopic composition and evaporation how these two controls vary in time and space and why this variability needs to be considered when inferring lake water isotope proxy records 5 1 regional variability in lake water δ2h and inferred inflow δ2h 5 1 1 coastal lakes the strong correlation between increasing distance from the coast and decreasing δ2hl r 2 0 90 p 0 001 fig 5a for the lakes closest to the coast c 200 km both coastal and the northernmost part of the transect suggests that distillation during atmospheric moisture transport prior to precipitation is the most important control on δ2hl for coastal lakes in this area δ2h and δ18o decrease by c 57 and 6 8 over 200 km or 28 and 3 4 per 100 km respectively fig 5a in the pacific northwest usa mountainous but drier than coastal norway the δ18o isotopic gradient is 1 2 per 100 km welker 2000 and in the sierra nevada usa wet year round most precipitation in winter some mountains 5 per 100 km ingraham taylor 1991 across the european plain from mild and wet coastal ireland to the continental foothills of the ural mountains the gradient is 0 2 per 100 km rozanski et al 1993 this means that our gradient is within ranges found elsewhere and most similar to gradients in similar environments wet mountainous coastal the least 2h depleted lakes are the ones at the northern coast and the outermost coast to the west of tromsø fig 4 since the transport from the source is shorter and there is not much rain out prior to precipitation three lakes in kirkenes are slightly 2h depleted compared to the other lakes at the outermost coast fig 1b and 4 none of these lakes have distinct outflows and relatively low d excess supplementary fig s1 suggests they are likely experiencing evaporative enrichment they may also receive source water with a slightly different isotopic signal being located near the barents sea lakes near tromsø are relatively 2h enriched compared to lakes slightly farther from the coast fig 4 in the coastal region most of the large through flowing lakes plot close to the mwl whereas some smaller lakes with low or unknown throughflow and long residence times fall below the mwl being more affected by evaporation fig 3 a couple of large through flowing lakes with large mountainous catchments plot above the mwl and close to tromsø amount weighted winter precipitation e g laksvatnet fig 4a and e 8 suggesting a longer response time and that the depleted meltwater from snow has not yet been flushed through in early july some of the local variability in coastal lake water δ2h can also be explained by differences in elevation fig 5b likely reflecting heterogeneous airflow patterns with fjords funneling onshore winds and mountains causing orographic precipitation the mountains cause the air masses to rise as they move inland from tromsø causing rainout and more negative δ2h values figs 4 5 and 7 lakes at a given distance from the coast have similar isotope values despite differences in elevation fig 5a b this is likely because precipitation at a given location forms at the same elevation in the atmosphere and that elevation rises over the mountains moving inland three high elevation coastal lakes 460 m a s l have δ2hl values comparable to other coastal lakes despite their high elevation fig 5b they have high d excess average 14 2 0 3 and plot above the mwl suggesting that their isotopic signals are biased toward winter precipitation in tromsø precipitation δ2h is relatively enriched compared to the more inland stations and does not show a strong seasonality in contrast d excess is significantly higher in fall and winter than in summer figs 2 and 3 due to kinetic fractionation effects when snow forms in mixed phase clouds vapor supersaturated over ice jouzel merlivat 1984 it is common for mountain lakes to receive most precipitation as snowfall and for their catchments to experience late snowmelt explaining the high d excess lake water values furthermore two of the lakes have small niche glaciers in their catchments contributing glacial meltwater thus our dataset suggests that coastal lakes are primarily influenced by varying degrees of distillation during atmospheric moisture transport precipitation amount and lake and catchment morphometry the latter two determining the lake water residence time 5 1 2 transect lakes in contrast to the coastal lakes most of the transect lakes experience more evaporative enrichment plotting below the mwl and along a lel figs 3 and 6 lake surface water from oikojärvi located close to naimakka st amour 2009 and guossajavri 125 km sw of our transect rosqvist et al 2013 fig 1b sampled between 2002 and 2008 fall along similar lels suggesting similar evaporation patterns on a regional scale and between years figs 6 and 8 the north atlantic is still the main moisture source so precipitation δ2h and as a result lake water δ2h becomes more and more depleted the first c 160 km along the transect reflecting rayleigh distillation during moisture transport figs 4 7 on the southeastern side of the mountains where the relief changes from highlands with incised valleys to a gently sloping plain with few hills there is a larger spread in δ2hl fig 7a and larger and more variable offsets between δ2hl and δ2hi fig 7c this coincides with the northern boundary of the northern aapa mire zone where large branched mire systems are common ruuhijärvi 1983 although lakes in wetland dominated catchments tend to have low e i gibson et al 2002 many of the lakes in this area are evaporatively enriched plotting on a lel and having low d excess figs 3 6 and 7d hydrologically closed basins lack of clear surface flow and or only seasonal connection by small streams or wetland areas may make these lakes susceptible to evaporation furthermore in continental regions at high latitudes seasonally arid conditions can increase the evaporative enrichment during the thaw season gibson et al 2005 smaller inter lake variation in δ2hi than in δ2hl fig 7a c suggests that most lakes have similar inflow seasonality and sources whereas evaporation indicated by decreasing d excess 0 92 per 100 km fig 7d increases moving southeast moreover some lakes possibly have δ2hl values influenced by factors in addition to evaporative enrichment some of the lakes might be groundwater fed since till and glaciofluvial aquifers are common in this region kortelainen karhu 2004 however there are no significant differences between the isotopic composition of precipitation and shallow groundwater till aquifers in northern finland and sweden kortelainen karhu 2004 both follow the same seasonal cycle with most enriched values in late fall and most depleted values after snowmelt we do therefore not expect shallow groundwater recharge to the lakes to significantly alter δ2hl lakes on the southeastern side of the scandinavian mountains most likely also receive precipitation from other moisture sources such as the baltic region and eurasia these sources are more depleted schmidt et al 1999 bailey et al 2021 but the travel distance may be shorter potentially resulting in less distillation and precipitation that is relatively enriched compared to atlantic moisture a phenomenon also observed in precipitation events in arctic alaska putman et al 2017 in summer precipitation can be induced by local convection and less influenced by atmospheric circulation jaagus 2009 local moisture could in this way at least partly explain the slightly enriched δ2hl of lakes closest to the bothnian bay fig 7a furthermore transpiration another process most important in summer can partly compensate for isotopic depletion caused by distillation during moisture transport by recycling soil moisture without fractionation rozanski et al 1982 the relative contribution of moisture from different source regions and the resulting isotopic compositions of precipitation can be assessed on an event basis at a given station bailey et al 2021 mellat et al 2021 but we do not have any data on this over longer time scales i e covering our study period or know how it varies within our study region most likely the isotopic composition of precipitation along our transect and therefore lake water inflow is controlled by a combination of different moisture source regions local convection and evapotranspiration 5 1 3 lake location and inflow seasonality comparing δ2hi to precipitation δ2h data from tromsø naimakka and rovaniemi as well as oipc modeled precipitation δ2h bowen 2021 suggests that winter precipitation is more important for inland lakes whereas coastal lakes tend to be summer biased or have an isotopic composition close to mean annual precipitation δ2h fig 7b a similar trend is seen on western greenland likely reflecting lake water inflow seasonality along an aridity gradient cluett thomas 2020 in our study area the inland region normally receives a greater fraction of the annual precipitation during the summer months fig 2 this lake water bias towards winter precipitation for inland lakes is likely due to lower relative humidity and higher evapotranspiration at inland sites in summer fig 2 even if a greater fraction of total precipitation falls in summer bowen et al 2018 that coastal lakes appear to be summer biased is somewhat unexpected considering that tromsø receives more winter precipitation than naimakka and rovaniemi figs 2 and 9d e oipc modeled precipitation δ2h values are based on interpolation using gnip values they are therefore biased towards the nearest gnip stations i e naimakka and rovaniemi which are more continental and experience a larger seasonality than tromsø figs 2 and 3 we compare the oipc values with precipitation samples collected in tromsø in 2019 2021 and can confirm that the modeled coastal values are indeed too depleted compared to our new precipitation isotope dataset fig 7a b however it cannot be excluded that the 2h depleted winter isotopes might have been efficiently flushed from some coastal lakes with short residence times especially considering the high precipitation amounts in june 2018 and 2019 fig 9 this suggests that lakes in this region likely reflect a range of summer to mean annual to winter biased precipitation δ2h figs 3 and 7 5 2 lake water δ2h and inferred inflow δ2h changes over time 5 2 1 interannual variability sampling campaigns concentrated in the first week of july in 2018 2019 and 2020 allowed us to get an insight into the interannual variability in δ2hl and δ2hi we focus this comparison on the transect lakes since we sampled coastal lakes in different locations each year i e in the tromsø area vs along the northern coast only three coastal lakes were sampled two or three of these years and they follow similar interannual patterns as the transect lakes fig 8a we sampled the transect lakes in 2019 and 2020 and extended the transect farther southeast in 2020 fig 7 twelve transect lakes sampled in both years had more 2h depleted δ2hl in 2020 and a lel intersecting the mwl at a more depleted value compared to 2019 fig 6b and 7a suggesting more depleted inflow water in 2020 than in 2019 this is supported by more depleted modeled δ2hi in 2020 compared to in 2019 fig 7b we suggest that the more 2h depleted values in 2020 were a response to 1 more precipitation in winter 2019 2020 than in 2018 2019 fig 9d e 2 later spring melt in 2020 than 2019 fig 9e resulting in less time prior to our july sampling for 2h enriched summer precipitation to flush the 2h depleted winter melt out of the lakes and or 3 more may june rainfall in 2019 than in 2020 fig 9d contributing to higher snowmelt bypass in 2019 i e more snow melting off the high elevation portions landscape before the lakes become ice free in the first half of june which would remove 2h depleted winter precipitation from the catchment without entering the lake the high precipitation amounts in january march 2020 were associated with extreme ao conditions and an exceptionally strong stratospheric polar vortex causing strong winter westerlies that carried greater than average amounts of moisture from the north atlantic over fennoscandia lawrence et al 2020 fig 9a d e an additional explanation for 2h depleted lake inflow values in 2020 could be a change in moisture source surface waters in the baltic sea are relatively 18o depleted compared to the north atlantic schmidt et al 1999 and a greater influence of baltic moisture to our study area could therefore contribute to more depleted precipitation in winter 2018 2019 most of the bothnian bay was sea ice covered whereas winter 2019 2020 baltic sea sea ice cover set a record for minimum winter extent in the 120 year long measuring period sjöfartsverket smhi 2020a 2020b however predominantly southwesterly winds and pressure systems moving eastward over the baltic sea in both years imply a low impact of baltic sea moisture to our study area during this period some lakes in the area have been sampled in previous studies allowing us to extend our interannual comparison further back in time in 2013 nine of the transect lakes were relatively enriched compared to the same lakes sampled in 2019 and or 2020 balascio et al 2018 fig 6a and 8 the interannual changes in lake water isotopic composition were parallel to the mwl suggesting that the lakes had more 2h enriched inflow water in 2013 than in 2019 and 2020 but that all years had a similar influence of evaporation the hydrological year 2012 2013 was relatively dry compared to 2018 2019 and 2019 2020 especially in tromsø fig 9d e however june and july 2013 were wet fig 9d and the lakes were sampled several weeks later than in 2019 and 2020 july 26 2013 n balascio personal communication suggesting that the relatively enriched lake water values reflect greater summer precipitation inflow to the lakes in 2013 two lakes close to naimakka oikojärvi and keitjoru that were sampled by st amour 2009 in july 2003 2004 and 2006 displayed a similar magnitude of interannual variability to the lakes in our dataset fig 8a the oikojärvi samples from july 2004 and 2006 were close to the mwl whereas the 2003 sample was evaporatively enriched along a lel perhaps due to exceptional dryness that year as suggested by st amour 2009 5 2 2 seasonal variability the lake water isotopic composition also follows a seasonal cycle st amour 2009 collected monthly samples excluding february and december from the two lakes in naimakka from 2002 to 2005 generally recording lowest values in the beginning of the ice free season due to isotopically depleted snowmelt increasing values over summer due to more enriched inflow isotopic composition and or evaporative enrichment and high and relatively stable composition during the ice cover season fig 8b guossajavri northern sweden showed a similar trend in 2007 and 2008 with the lake moving up along the lel during the summer months and being recharged in winter rosqvist et al 2013 fig 8b this is in agreement with other lakes in northern sweden jonsson et al 2009 and elsewhere in the arctic leng anderson 2003 tondu et al 2013 we sampled two lakes in tromsø in march june july and or september in 2018 2020 except for a low march value the seasonal isotope patterns in these lakes are similar to interannual patterns in all the lakes isotope values tend to move parallel to the mwl implying changes in inflow isotopic composition rather than changes in evaporation although we do not have samples to examine seasonal variability in the transect lakes given the similarities in interannual variability between the coast and transect we hypothesize the transect lakes experience similar seasonal changes in inflow isotopic composition with constant influence of evaporative enrichment 5 3 implications for precipitation proxy reconstructions interpreting isotope proxy records often assumes that for a given record the control on the lake water isotopic variability is constant through time we have demonstrated that lakes in this region display variable sensitivity to changes in inflow precipitation isotopic composition and to evaporative enrichment and that these controls vary in both time and space resolving these controls on modern lake water isotopes is important for making quantitative paleoclimate inferences depending on what aspect of the hydrological cycle we aim to reconstruct e g atmospheric circulation precipitation amount or seasonality moisture balance we can target different lakes in parts of our study area modern precipitation isotopes have strong seasonal variability figs 2 and 7 and if this signal is preserved in lake sediment proxy records we can use it to reconstruct changes in precipitation seasonality cluett thomas 2020 thomas et al 2020 the seasonality preserved in a proxy record depends on the δ2h or δ18o of source lake or soil water at the time of proxy synthesis which can vary between proxies corcoran et al 2021 lake water isotopic composition and seasonal variability depends on the lake water residence time jonsson et al 2010 tondu et al 2013 ala aho et al 2018 which may also change through time previous paleoclimate work in northern fennoscandia suggests that changes in holocene precipitation isotopes are strongly linked to changes in air temperature and air mass sources lacustrine carbonates biogenic silica and cellulose from non evaporated lakes in northern sweden have been used to reconstruct past changes in lake water δ18o and precipitation shemesh et al 2001 hammarlund et al 2002 rosqvist et al 2004 2007 2013 st amour 2009 jonsson et al 2010 in most of these studies depleted summer lake water δ18o was inferred to reflect increased influence of arctic air masses furthermore rosqvist et al 2013 suggested that periods of relatively high δ18odiatom reflect a dominance of summer precipitation related to a positive ao index whereas low δ18odiatom reflects dominant winter precipitation due to positive nao studying modern conditions can aid proxy interpretations since it allows us to directly link isotopic changes to observations of atmospheric circulation change arctic ocean and baltic sea surface waters are relatively depleted compared to north atlantic moisture legrande schmidt 2006 bonne et al 2019 suggesting that depleted precipitation isotopes and thereby lake water isotopes may reflect a change to dominance of arctic or baltic air masses however this will depend on the location of the lake and the moisture travel distance atlantic moisture which is originally less depleted that has been transported a long distance may have experienced more distillation than more locally derived moisture with a more depleted starting isotopic composition and therefore also be relatively depleted putman et al 2017 cluett et al 2021 our 2h depleted lake water values in 2020 were likely not caused by a shift in moisture source region but by high winter precipitation amounts associated with ao conditions and an increase in north atlantic moisture lawrence et al 2020 greater than average winter precipitation amounts over fennoscandia can result from both extremely positive and negative winter ao conditions although from different moisture sources north atlantic vs barents sea lawrence et al 2020 bailey et al 2021 complicating things further modern moisture from the barents sea has an isotopic composition comparable to north atlantic moisture due to increased strength of the north atlantic current bailey et al 2021 if conditions were similar in the past the atlantic and barents sea moisture sources would be difficult to distinguish from one another in proxy records our lake water isotope observations imply that seasonal changes in precipitation amounts need to be taken into account when inferring atmospheric circulation from a proxy record in this region and that changes in precipitation isotope values can be a result of a change in precipitation seasonality moisture source or a combination of both for reconstructions of atmospheric circulation and precipitation we should target lakes that are minimally impacted by evaporative enrichment since evaporation overprints the precipitation signal in our dataset most lakes 100 km from the coast have low d excess values suggesting that evaporative enrichment affects them to some degree regardless of their throughflow regime figs 3 6a and 7 all transect lakes appear to fall on similar lels but with slope and intercept varying from year to year depending on seasonality fig 6 on interannual and seasonal timescales changes in inflow appear to have a larger impact than evaporation with isotope values moving along the mwl fig 8 on longer timescales evaporation may be more important making it difficult to disentangle how much of the variability derives from each process i e inflow vs evaporation hence we suggest that through flowing coastal lakes are better targets for precipitation reconstructions since changes in their lake water isotopic composition are more likely to primarily reflect changes in the inflow for evapo concentrated lakes there are a few possible approaches to separate the precipitation from the evaporation signal including 1 comparing two lakes with contrasting residence times anderson et al 2001 2 comparing terrestrial and aquatic leaf waxes in the same lake rach et al 2017 or 3 measuring both δ2h and δ18o in the same records gibson et al 2005 for the first approach one needs to identify a non evaporated lake with short residence time low δ2hl δ2hi and one evaporated lake with longer residence time high δ2hl δ2hi anderson et al 2001 moreover the lakes must receive source water reflecting the same precipitation seasonality and evaporation should be the only factor that differs between the two the offset between δ2hl and δ2hi for our transect lakes is 10 independent of throughflow suggesting that it will be difficult to identify an unevaporated lake in this region which would be needed for this approach using the second approach one compares terrestrial and aquatic leaf wax δ2h in the same record which have source water representing the same seasonality in areas where terrestrial plant source water is evaporatively enriched but the aquatic plant source water is not the isotopic difference between the two reflects leaf water evaporative enrichment rach et al 2017 thomas et al 2018 curtin et al 2019 in contrast lake water in arid areas has been suggested to be more evaporatively enriched than terrestrial leaf water meaning that the difference primarily reflects the evaporative enrichment of lake water mügler et al 2008 balascio et al 2013 along our transect both aquatic and terrestrial leaf waxes likely incorporate a signal of evaporative 2h enrichment due to low relative humidity and warm conditions in summer figs 2 and 9b c thus a dual leaf wax approach to separate precipitation and evaporation signals might not be applicable along the transect but may be possible at coastal lakes for the third approach one measures δ2h and δ18o in the same lakes which may allow estimation of past changes in the slope of the lel gibson et al 2005 that could subsequently be used to infer past inflow values theoretically this is possible however it involves many uncertainties first one needs to analyze the same proxies at the same time slice in several lakes second those two proxies one with δ2h and one with δ18o need to reflect the same pool of water for the same window of time in a season moreover one needs to have good constraints on biosynthetic and other fractionation factors brandriss et al 1998 sachse et al 2012 lombino et al 2021 to be able to estimate lake water δ2h and δ18o and directly compare δ2h and δ18o from different proxies corcoran et al 2021 a more recent approach to guide paleoclimate interpretations is to use proxy system modeling which uses modern climate variables as inputs to mathematical descriptions of lake water isotope and energy balance e g prysm2 0 dee et al 2018 by conducting sensitivity tests in which we iteratively change values of one or more climate parameters e g lower relative humidity more winter precipitation we can quantify the parameter or combination of parameters that could explain changes recorded in lake water isotope proxies for lakes in our transect we could for example focus on variables that affect the lake water inflow isotopic signal and amount of evaporative enrichment to assess the sensitivity of the lake water isotopic composition to these variables if we have an estimate of how a change in moisture source would affect the precipitation isotopes we can modify the inflow isotope value in the model to see how this would impact the lake water isotope value one way to simulate how a shift in moisture source would influence the lake water inflow value is to use a one dimensional rayleigh type distillation model along a theoretical trajectory sodemann et al 2008 steen larsen et al 2011 cluett et al 2021 these approaches can provide us with quantitative constraints on past climate changes when interpreting lake water derived isotope proxy data from northern fennoscandia we need to consider the magnitude of variability in both inflow isotopic composition and evaporation on the coast inflow causes more variability than evaporation considering the variability among the transect lakes the ranges for δ2hi and δ2hl are similar suggesting that inflow and evaporation might be equally important interannual variability is largely due to changes in inflow isotopic composition however suggesting the importance of inflow isotopic composition even in lakes that are strongly influenced by evaporation therefore we recommend targeting through flowing lakes by the coast for precipitation reconstructions if working with more continental records we need to address the significance of both inflow and evaporation processes importantly our data show that we cannot interpret all isotopic variability in evapo concentrated basins in terms of evaporation as there might also be a substantial variability in inflow isotopic composition through time data availability water isotope data are freely available in the water

3587,floods cause substantial damage across the world every year accurate and timely prediction of floods can significantly minimize the loss of life and property recently numerous machine learning models have been used for flood prediction showing that their performance is preferable to traditional statistical models however the existing models neglect the spatial features of floods which drive flood generation and concentration in this paper the area of interest is divided into grids based on longitude and latitude and the rainfall and discharge collected by stations are combined into tensors according to station coordinates different from one dimensional time series our input feature is a two dimensional time series with spatial information hence combining a convolutional neural network cnn with a long short term memory network lstm we propose the convolution lstm convlstm to extract spatiotemporal features of hydrological information the methodology is demonstrated using the hydrological data collected at the xi county stations located on the huai river in henan province china numerical results indicate that the relative error of arrival time is within 30 and the relative error of peak discharge is within 20 satisfying the 2005 chinese water resource standard on flood prediction permit error the experiments also show that the convlstm outperforms the recent models in terms of flood arrival time and peak discharge thereby proving a promising alternative keywords flood prediction spatiotemporal characteristics convlstm deep learning 1 introduction floods are typically affected by numerous factors such as precipitation evaporation solar radiation underlying surfaces and atmospheric circulation they present the composite features of strong nonlinearity and high uncertainty southern china is a flood prone area each year floods cause massive damage to human life infrastructure agriculture and the socioeconomic system accurate and timely prediction of floods can help decision making in flood control and greatly minimize the losses currently there are various methods for flood prediction the traditional statistical model is based on the principle of flood formation such as the xin anjiang model zhang et al 2016 although statistical models showed considerable capabilities in predicting a diverse range of flooding scenarios they often require various hydro geomorphological monitoring datasets requiring intensive computation wang et al 2021 which prohibits short term prediction and takes significant time and resources to develop similar to numerical and statistical models data driven models also have a long tradition in flood modeling machine learning ml has gained significant popularity as a recent data driven technique the ml based time series predictive models used in hydrology have shown better performance which are also more cost effective as a typical time series predictive model recurrent neural networks rnn have been utilized to construct hydrological models since the 2000s in sajikumar and thandaveswara 1999 the authors compared the performance of rnn models with physical models and demonstrated that they outperformed their counterparts with finite datasets basin rainfall has been used as the time series input to obtain the probability distribution function of the rainfall in the future amit 2019 long short term memory lstm network evolved from rnn has been widely used in flood prediction since it can not only address the issues related to gradient disappearance and explosion but also improve the accuracy of time series prediction ye et al 2019 in widiasari et al 2018 the authors used the lstm model to process the time series data such as rainfall and water level and compared the lstm with the basic rnn model the results showed that the lstm was more accurate in predicting the downstream water level although the time series predictive algorithms can better extract the time features hydrological information also has spatial features dembélé et al 2020 for example the upstream and downstream relationships between two gage stations determine the process of flood production and concentration hence spatial representation of hydrological information is crucial for accurate flood prediction termeh et al combined adaptive neural fuzzy inference system anfis with different heuristic algorithms to extract spatial features of hydrological data to map flood hazard areas monjardin et al 2020 panahi and sadhasivam et al used a convolutional neural network cnn model to create an groundwater regime map panahi et al 2020 teng and lang et al proposed a flood event recognition method based on semantics and cnn to address the multi label image classification lv et al 2021 by incorporating people s experience and the cnn obtained spatial features teng et al 2017 table 1 summarizes the accuracy of the flood prediction models mentioned above traditional methods extract either temporal or spatial features without extracting the spatiotemporal features of hydrological information in this paper we designed a new paradigm of combining spatial features with time series prediction to extract spatiotemporal characteristics the main challenge in flood prediction is to predict hydrological data at time t n through the hydrological data at time t 1 t 2 t n 1 we divided a geographical area into an m n grid according to longitude and latitude as shown in fig 1 each grid represents a small area and p is the observation value of rainfall which can be regarded as continuous in the small surrounding area hence for each moment t the spatial distribution matrix of rainfall can be obtained and stacked together with different moments the spatial distribution tensor obtained through this is similar to the tensor obtained by stacking several pixel matrices with time correlation that is the video data considering the fact that videos can provide spatiotemporal hydrological information this paper uses video predictive technology for flood prediction in computer vision video prediction tang et al 2019 has become a hot research topic since it can be trained with massive unlabeled natural video data wan et al 2022 thereby offering numerous applications pan et al proposed a deep neural network based on spatiotemporal characteristics to predict future images pan et al 2019 goswami et al predicted the motion track of strong convective cloud based on cnns to realize the large scale precipitation forecast goswami et al 2020 the video predictive algorithm called the convolution lstm convlstm pfeuffer and dietmayer 2019 combines the time series prediction and the spatial features extraction based on the convlstm this paper predicts the discharge in the next 20 h according to the rainfall and discharge in the xi county basin the experiments show that the algorithm can extract the spatiotemporal characteristics of regional hydrological information and achieve better prediction results as shown in fig 2 the flood prediction methods are divided into four categories the thick blue arrow represents the time series prediction based on statistical models used in early years the thick orange arrow indicates the time series prediction based on deep learning used heavily now the thick green arrow indicates the spatiotemporal series prediction based on statistical models the thick red arrow represents the spatiotemporal series prediction based on deep learning used in this paper the main contributions of this paper are as follows a new paradigm of adding spatial features to time series prediction combination of two distinct models from different fields cnn and lstm for flood prediction the time and peak re of flood in xi county is less than 20 and 10 respectively convlstm model improves the prediction accuracy of discharge compared with other models the remainder of this paper is organized as follows section i reviews the state of the art and highlights the significance of flood prediction section ii introduces the study area and the dataset used section iii provides the system predictive model section iv explains the experiments performed based on the dataset from xi county finally section v draws conclusions and point out future research directions 2 study area and data 2 1 study area the basin studied in this paper is located in xi county which is located to xinyang city henan province china it is located in the southeast of henan province and northeast of xinyang city it crosses the huai river from north to south between 113 2977 to 114 7325 e and 31 5971 to 32 6176 n of which 1715 79 square kilometres is land accounting for 90 66 176 67 square kilometres is water area accounting for 9 34 the total water resources are accounting for 7 84 among which the surface water is about 525 million cubic meters and the groundwater is about 259 million cubic meters xi county is located in the humid monsoon area of transition from north subtropical to warm temperate zone the annual average temperature is 15 2 c due to the unique location the rainy season is from april to september with an average precipitation of 946 mm fig 3 shows the specific rainfall distribution and hydrological stations in the xi county basin there are 50 rainfall stations constantly monitoring the rainfall situation at the outlet of the basin there is a discharge station for monitoring the water level and discharge located on the southern edge of the huanghuai plain it is mainly low lying plain terrain with an average altitude of 47 meters the terrain in the north of the huai river is slightly inclined from northwest to southeast and the terrain in the south of the huai river gradually decreases from northeast to southwest due to the long term influence of geology external forces and erosion the surface morphology can be divided into three types hills depressions and plains all rivers in the xi county belong to the huai river system except the huai river and all of them are sourced by precipitation for simplicity all symbols used in the paper are listed in table 2 2 2 data process 2 2 1 construct dataset in this paper we use the rainfall data recorded from january 1 2010 to december 31 2018 in the xi county basin where the discharge at the basin outlet is selected as the research dataset we divide the dataset into training set validation set and test set according to the ratio of 5 2 2 in which the training set is used to fit the model the validation set is a separate dataset in the process of model training which can be used to adjust the hyperparameters of the model and evaluate its ability to prevent overfitting the test set is used to evaluate the generalization ability of the final model due to the limitations of data acquisition equipment and human errors in the collection process some data are lost therefore we use linear interpolation to complete the missing hydrological data points chen and chou 2019 the traditional flood predictive models process the hydrological data of the whole basin into one dimensional time series and only predict the flood based on the time dimension which results in the loss of spatial information of hydrological data hence we use the image feature extraction model to address this issue based on the convolution calculation to use the convolution calculation better we grid the studied watershed according to longitude and latitude and process its hydrological information into a 23 19 matrix the missing elements in the matrix are completed by kriging interpolation li et al 2020 which is based on the first law of geography i e it uses the weighted sum of all the known stations to estimate the data of unknown stations as 1 z o i 1 n λ i z i where λ i is the weight coefficient which is different from the inverse distance weighting precisely it is not the reciprocal of the distance but a set of coefficients minimizing the error between the estimated value z 0 and the actual value z i hence we can get the spatial distribution of hydrological data by gridding then we can stack the spatial distribution matrices of hydrological data at different moments to obtain its two dimensional spatiotemporal characteristics which are used when training the model table 3 shows an example of spatiotemporal data at a certain time after processing 2 2 2 data analysis there are two perspectives in the time series analysis one is the analysis of historical series where the data can be intuitively observed allowing us to determine the cause the other is trend prediction in which the future trend of the data is judged by its historical fluctuation as shown in fig 4 the paper decomposes the rainfall to extract more information from the fluctuations in rainfall seasonal shows a clear periodic pattern revealing a uniform seasonal change resid denotes outliers or missing values which are the stochastic characteristics of rainfall trend shows consistent upwards or downwards slopes and there is a peak between may and september every year when the data is decomposed into the predictable part and the random fluctuation part if the proportion of the predictable part is much higher than the random one the sequence can help predict future trends hence we can predict the future hydrologic characteristics of rainfall after decomposing it based on the analysis of the constructed dataset fig 5 shows that the fluctuation of rainfall and discharge are roughly similar i e there is a time correlation between them hence the rainfall will affect the discharge in the future fig 6 shows the spatial distribution of rainfall in the basin revealing that the rainfall has obvious spatial trends and strong spatial autocorrelation characteristics it is confirmed in patabendige et al 2019 that rainfall has a relatively stable spatial variation law 3 methodology 3 1 model for the comprehensive analysis of spatiotemporal characteristics of rainfall this paper integrates the image spatial features extraction into time series analysis for the first time in literature we apply convlstm to flood prediction which is derived from the fully connected long short term memory network fc lstm the main difference between convlstm and fc lstm is the input dimension since the fc lstm input data is one dimensional it is unsuitable for spatial sequence data such as video satellite and radar image datasets hence in this paper convlstm is designed for the three dimensional hydrological data as its input including longitude latitude elevation rainfall discharge and other information of each station convlstm replaces the all connection layer with convolution calculation i e the matrix multiplication becomes convolution according to the following eq 2 2 z u v i j x i j k u i v j convlstm replaces the matrix multiplication of each gate in the lstm with convolution through which it captures the basic spatial features in the multidimensional data therefore convlstm is a time series processing model which can extract spatial features fig 7 shows the model unit structure in which the input output and forgetting layer states are obtained as below 3 i t σ w xi χ t w hi h t 1 w ci c t 1 b i 4 f t σ w xf χ t w hf h t 1 w cf c t 1 b f 5 c t f t c t 1 i t tanh w xc χ t w hc h t 1 b c 6 o t σ w xo χ t w ho h t 1 w co c t b o 7 h t o t tanh c t where denotes the convolution o denotes the hadamard multiplication w is the weight matrix of each layer i t is the input gate state f t is the forget gate state using to determine the proportion of the previous state c t 1 can be retained for the current moment furthermore c t is the state of the cell at the current moment and o t is the state of the output gate both c t and o t are used to determine the state of the hidden layer h t which is simultaneously input to the next unit of the same layer and the next network layer compared to the fc lstm the weight matrix is respectively multiplied by input and hidden states while the convlstm is convoluted and the spatial characteristics of hydrological data are extracted by adding convolution kernels to realize the spatiotemporal prediction we use convlstm as a basic building block the stacked convlstm extracts the highly abstract features layer by layer and then predicts by mapping them to the pixel value space in the convlstm architecture as illustrated in fig 8 the cell states are constrained inside each convlstm layer and updated horizontally the information is conveyed upwards by only the hidden states such a temporal memory flow is reasonable in supervised learning since the hidden representations can be more and more abstract from the bottom upwards according to the study of the stacked convolutional layers considering these this paper constructs a flood predictive model by stacking multi layer convlstm cells fig 9 illustrates the architecture of the proposed model which can be explained from a similar point of view as in sutskever et al 2014 and the following equation can be used to describe the multi step prediction 8 y t 1 y t 2 y t 3 arg max p y t 1 y t 2 y t 3 x t 2 x t 1 x t f decoder f encoder x t 2 x t 1 x t this architecture is also similar to the predictive model in srivastava et al 2015 which is based on the lstm however our input and output elements are all 3d tensors preserving spatial information furthermore since the network has multiple stacked convlstm layers it has strong representational power that makes it suitable for the prediction of complex dynamical systems such as the flood prediction problem we study here 4 experiment 4 1 evaluation index to minimize the material and nonmaterial losses caused by floods we must predict the arrival time and the discharge of the flood peak to evaluate the performance of our model in terms of flood peak s arrival time and discharge prediction we use the root mean squared error rmse relative error re and coefficient of determination r 2 rmse describes the average offset between the predicted and real values estimating the standard deviation of the residual error the higher the rmse the higher the predictive accuracy of the model re is the ratio between the absolute error and the real value in general re can better reflect the credibility of a model r 2 varies from 0 to 1 and a larger r 2 refers to a better fitting degree of the experimental model to the observed value 4 2 simulation result 4 2 1 determine model parameters the computer configuration and software environment used in the experiment are as follows the processor is i9 9900 k the graphics card is geforce rtx 2080 ti the memory is 64260 kb the system is ubuntu 16 04 1 64 bit the program language version is python 3 7 the integrated development environment is the anaconda lastly the model is designed based on the keras framework the pred iction accuracy of the model depends on the setting of its hyperparameters gradient descent is one of the most popular methods used to determine the optimal parameters of ml algorithms i e unconstrained optimization problems it can solve the minimum loss function and find the model parameters step by step which takes the partial derivative of the loss function concerning model parameters weight and bias the partial derivative of each parameter expressed by the vector is gradient along the opposite direction of the gradient vector that is loss w loss b the loss function decreases the fastest hence it is easier to find its minimum value the most significant factors for the gradient descent algorithm are the step size α and the descent direction the model learning rate determines whether we can find the global optimal solution with an appropriate step size as we can see from fig 10 if α is too large e g α 4 it may skip the optimal solution such as the optimal model parameter x 3 differently if the selected value is too small e g α 2 it will fall into the local optimal solution such as x 2 hence the appropriate selection of the step size is crucial in this paper we used 0 005 and 0 001 as the step size of model training and fig 11 shows the loss trend in the model training process under the used step sizes as shown the model oscillates when α is 0 001 and stabilizes when α is 0 005 therefore we use α as 0 005 in our experiments the descent direction of the algorithm largely determines whether we can find the optimal direction fig 10 shows that the loss will be higher if the algorithm chooses w a as the descent direction in practice different optimizers choose different descending directions in this paper we use adaptive moment estimation adam and stochastic gradient descent sgd as optimizers where algorithms 1 and 2 provide their pseudocodes respectively the stochastic objective function of these algorithms is the evaluation index defined in section 4 1 from the pseudocode of adam we can observe that it increases the first order momentum which is the exponential moving average of the gradient direction at each timestep in other words the descending direction at timestep t is determined by not only the gradient direction of the current timestep but also the previously accumulated descending direction which can effectively suppress the oscillation of sgd adam can also introduce a second order momentum based on sgd allowing it to update each parameter with a different learning rate that is significant for dnns with a high number of parameters which are not always available for parameters that are updated frequently we accumulate a lot of knowledge about them and we do not want to be affected too much by a single sample and hope that the learning rate will be slower we do not know much about the occasionally updated parameters hence we hope to learn more from each accidental sample which refers to a higher learning rate fig 12 illustrates the results of using sgd and adam as optimizers of the convlstm model based on the convergence speed and the performance of each optimizer shown in fig 12 adam is selected due to its timeliness in flood prediction

values of other hyperparameters we use the control variable method we know that with the increase of batch size in a certain range the faster the training speed the more accurate the direction of finding the optimal gradient descent and the smaller the fluctuation in training if the batch size is too large however it will slow down the optimization of network parameters similarly with the increase of epoch in a reasonable range network training oscillation gets smaller if the epoch is too large the network will appear over fitting a set of loss graphs shown in fig 13 is obtained through several experiments which allowed us to set the batch size and epoch of the network to 64 and 20 respectively the network width and depth are also important factors affecting the model performance the former refers to the number of neurons in a particular layer while the latter is represented by the number of layers in the network the higher the number of network layers the stronger the characterization ability however the performance enhancement slows down with the increasing number of network layers which also greatly reduces the training speed to determine the number of network layers and neurons in each layer we design the following structures for each convolution and pooling layer table 4 shows the predictive errors corresponding to various network structures where 3 3 represents the size of the convolution kernel and 40 10 1 represents the number of convolution kernels in each network layer or the neurons in the fully connected layer finally we choose a three layer convolution network with 40 10 1 convolution kernels in each layer and a superimposed three layer fully connected network with 100 60 20 neurons in each layer as the final model to be used in our experiments table 5 lists the values of each parameter used in the final model 4 2 2 results analysis to train the model we use the training and validation sets and to test it we use the data from 2017 and 2018 fig 14 shows the predictive results at the xixian station for the prediction times of the to 5 10 15 20 and 25 h respectively as table 6 reveals the predictive accuracy gradually decreases with the increasing prediction time however when the prediction time is 5 h the prediction accuracy is lower than that of longer prediction times such as 10 15 h that is mainly because when the prediction time is too short the input hydrological characteristics will be fewer resulting in less information that the model can learn which will inevitably lower the prediction accuracy to address this issue we increase the length of the input tensor enriching the information that the model can learn as fig 14 shows the model accuracy has improved when the predictive time is 5 h however the computation time will prolong as the length of the input tensor increases there are many variants of convolution and the calculation is complex most of the time is spent on convolution calculation when the neural network runs the development of the model increases the depth of the network hence it is crucial to optimize the convolution calculation otherwise reducing the complexity of the model will not be possible fig 14 shows that the flooding process predicted by the convlstm is roughly similar to the observed data when the prediction time is 10 h independent of the flood predictive model the peak value and the peak arrival time of the flood are the most concerning problems of each flood control department for a more intuitive understanding of model predictive accuracy we extract five flood processes with a discharge of more than 800 m 3 s as shown in fig 15 table 7 shows the arrival time of the actual peak the predictive peak the peak relative error the actual peak discharge the predictive peak discharge and the peak discharge relative error considering also the results in fig 14 we observe that the arrival time of the peak relative error is within 30 and the peak discharge relative error is within 20 satisfying the 2005 chinese water resource standard on flood prediction permit error press 2005 therefore the proposed convlstm model based on spatiotemporal characteristics has a good predictive effect fig 16 compares the observed discharge in the xixian station in 2017 and 2018 with the discharge predicted by convlstm and lstm models the rmse and r 2 of the lstm model are 0 0642 and 0 7432 respectively compared with table 6 the predictive accuracy of the traditional time series predictive model i e lstm is inferior to that of our model which shows that the addition of spatial characteristics to time series can improve the accuracy of the model 5 conclusion in this paper we divided a rainfall discharge area with hydrological information into grids and transformed it into an image like structure then we used the proposed convlstm model combined with image processing capabilities for flood prediction our model incorporates a typical cnn for image processing and a conventional time series predictor for extracting the spatiotemporal characteristics of hydrological information which cannot be efficiently handled by the traditional machine learning models the hydrological data e g rainfall and flow were interpolated and grouped into a dataset to train the proposed convlstm model the numerical results revealed that the convlstm could provide better predictive results than the existing methods concerning three statistical indexes therefore the proposed method is a promising alternative for improving the accuracy of medium and short term discharge prediction there are still some interesting open problems related to flood prediction based on time series which include the following our proposed model achieves comparable performance for medium and short term discharge prediction through numerical experiments however it is challenging to make a long term more than 72 h flood prediction the long term prediction with high accuracy strives for more time for various preparations for flood control although the model can make accurate predictions it has limitations such as being complex and requiring more parameters for the training which refer to more samples from the area of interest therefore flood prediction of areas with few samples needs further investigation declaration of competing interest the authors declare

basic rnn model the results showed that the lstm was more accurate in predicting the downstream water level although the time series predictive algorithms can better extract the time features hydrological information also has spatial features dembélé et al 2020 for example the upstream and downstream relationships between two gage stations determine the process of flood production and concentration hence spatial representation of hydrological information is crucial for accurate flood prediction termeh et al combined adaptive neural fuzzy inference system anfis with different heuristic algorithms to extract spatial features of hydrological data to map flood hazard areas monjardin et al 2020 panahi and sadhasivam et al used a convolutional neural network cnn model to create an groundwater regime map panahi et al 2020 teng and lang et al proposed a flood event recognition method based on semantics and cnn to address the multi label image classification lv et al 2021 by incorporating people s experience and the cnn obtained spatial features teng et al 2017 table 1 summarizes the accuracy of the flood prediction models mentioned above traditional methods extract either temporal or spatial features without extracting the spatiotemporal features of hydrological information in this paper we designed a new paradigm of combining spatial features with time series prediction to extract spatiotemporal characteristics the main challenge in flood prediction is to predict hydrological data at time t n through the hydrological data at time t 1 t 2 t n 1 we divided a geographical area into an m n grid according to longitude and latitude as shown in fig 1 each grid represents a small area and p is the observation value of rainfall which can be regarded as continuous in the small surrounding area hence for each moment t the spatial distribution matrix of rainfall can be obtained and stacked together with different moments the spatial distribution tensor obtained through this is similar to the tensor obtained by stacking several pixel matrices with time correlation that is the video data considering the fact that videos can provide spatiotemporal hydrological information this paper uses video predictive technology for flood prediction in computer vision video prediction tang et al 2019 has become a hot research topic since it can be trained with massive unlabeled natural video data wan et al 2022 thereby offering numerous applications pan et al proposed a deep neural network based on spatiotemporal characteristics to predict future images pan et al 2019 goswami et al predicted the motion track of strong convective cloud based on cnns to realize the large scale precipitation forecast goswami et al 2020 the video predictive algorithm called the convolution lstm convlstm pfeuffer and dietmayer 2019 combines the time series prediction and the spatial features extraction based on the convlstm this paper predicts the discharge in the next 20 h according to the rainfall and discharge in the xi county basin the experiments show that the algorithm can extract the spatiotemporal characteristics of regional hydrological information and achieve better prediction results as shown in fig 2 the flood prediction methods are divided into four categories the thick blue arrow represents the time series prediction based on statistical models used in early years the thick orange arrow indicates the time series prediction based on deep learning used heavily now the thick green arrow indicates the spatiotemporal series prediction based on statistical models the thick red arrow represents the spatiotemporal series prediction based on deep learning used in this paper the main contributions of this paper are as follows a new paradigm of adding spatial features to time series prediction combination of two distinct models from different fields cnn and lstm for flood prediction the time and peak re of flood in xi county is less than 20 and 10 respectively convlstm model improves the prediction accuracy of discharge compared with other models the remainder of this paper is organized as follows section i reviews the state of the art and highlights the significance of flood prediction section ii introduces the study area and the dataset used section iii provides the system predictive model section iv explains the experiments performed based on the dataset from xi county finally section v draws conclusions and point out future research directions 2 study area and data 2 1 study area the basin studied in this paper is located in xi county which is located to xinyang city henan province china it is located in the southeast of henan province and northeast of xinyang city it crosses the huai river from north to south between 113 2977 to 114 7325 e and 31 5971 to 32 6176 n of which 1715 79 square kilometres is land accounting for 90 66 176 67 square kilometres is water area accounting for 9 34 the total water resources are accounting for 7 84 among which the surface water is about 525 million cubic meters and the groundwater is about 259 million cubic meters xi county is located in the humid monsoon area of transition from north subtropical to warm temperate zone the annual average temperature is 15 2 c due to the unique location the rainy season is from april to september with an average precipitation of 946 mm fig 3 shows the specific rainfall distribution and hydrological stations in the xi county basin there are 50 rainfall stations constantly monitoring the rainfall situation at the outlet of the basin there is a discharge station for monitoring the water level and discharge located on the southern edge of the huanghuai plain it is mainly low lying plain terrain with an average altitude of 47 meters the terrain in the north of the huai river is slightly inclined from northwest to southeast and the terrain in the south of the huai river gradually decreases from northeast to southwest due to the long term influence of geology external forces and erosion the surface morphology can be divided into three types hills depressions and plains all rivers in the xi county belong to the huai river system except the huai river and all of them are sourced by precipitation for simplicity all symbols used in the paper are listed in table 2 2 2 data process 2 2 1 construct dataset in this paper we use the rainfall data recorded from january 1 2010 to december 31 2018 in the xi county basin where the discharge at the basin outlet is selected as the research dataset we divide the dataset into training set validation set and test set according to the ratio of 5 2 2 in which the training set is used to fit the model the validation set is a separate dataset in the process of model training which can be used to adjust the hyperparameters of the model and evaluate its ability to prevent overfitting the test set is used to evaluate the generalization ability of the final model due to the limitations of data acquisition equipment and human errors in the collection process some data are lost therefore we use linear interpolation to complete the missing hydrological data points chen and chou 2019 the traditional flood predictive models process the hydrological data of the whole basin into one dimensional time series and only predict the flood based on the time dimension which results in the loss of spatial information of hydrological data hence we use the image feature extraction model to address this issue based on the convolution calculation to use the convolution calculation better we grid the studied watershed according to longitude and latitude and process its hydrological information into a 23 19 matrix the missing elements in the matrix are completed by kriging interpolation li et al 2020 which is based on the first law of geography i e it uses the weighted sum of all the known stations to estimate the data of unknown stations as 1 z o i 1 n λ i z i where λ i is the weight coefficient which is different from the inverse distance weighting precisely it is not the reciprocal of the distance but a set of coefficients minimizing the error between the estimated value z 0 and the actual value z i hence we can get the spatial distribution of hydrological data by gridding then we can stack the spatial distribution matrices of hydrological data at different moments to obtain its two dimensional spatiotemporal characteristics which are used when training the model table 3 shows an example of spatiotemporal data at a certain time after processing 2 2 2 data analysis there are two perspectives in the time series analysis one is the analysis of historical series where the data can be intuitively observed allowing us to determine the cause the other is trend prediction in which the future trend of the data is judged by its historical fluctuation as shown in fig 4 the paper decomposes the rainfall to extract more information from the fluctuations in rainfall seasonal shows a clear periodic pattern revealing a uniform seasonal change resid denotes outliers or missing values which are the stochastic characteristics of rainfall trend shows consistent upwards or downwards slopes and there is a peak between may and september every year when the data is decomposed into the predictable part and the random fluctuation part if the proportion of the predictable part is much higher than the random one the sequence can help predict future trends hence we can predict the future hydrologic characteristics of rainfall after decomposing it based on the analysis of the constructed dataset fig 5 shows that the fluctuation of rainfall and discharge are roughly similar i e there is a time correlation between them hence the rainfall will affect the discharge in the future fig 6 shows the spatial distribution of rainfall in the basin revealing that the rainfall has obvious spatial trends and strong spatial autocorrelation characteristics it is confirmed in patabendige et al 2019 that rainfall has a relatively stable spatial variation law 3 methodology 3 1 model for the comprehensive analysis of spatiotemporal characteristics of rainfall this paper integrates the image spatial features extraction into time series analysis for the first time in literature we apply convlstm to flood prediction which is derived from the fully connected long short term memory network fc lstm the main difference between convlstm and fc lstm is the input dimension since the fc lstm input data is one dimensional it is unsuitable for spatial sequence data such as video satellite and radar image datasets hence in this paper convlstm is designed for the three dimensional hydrological data as its input including longitude latitude elevation rainfall discharge and other information of each station convlstm replaces the all connection layer with convolution calculation i e the matrix multiplication becomes convolution according to the following eq 2 2 z u v i j x i j k u i v j convlstm replaces the matrix multiplication of each gate in the lstm with convolution through which it captures the basic spatial features in the multidimensional data therefore convlstm is a time series processing model which can extract spatial features fig 7 shows the model unit structure in which the input output and forgetting layer states are obtained as below 3 i t σ w xi χ t w hi h t 1 w ci c t 1 b i 4 f t σ w xf χ t w hf h t 1 w cf c t 1 b f 5 c t f t c t 1 i t tanh w xc χ t w hc h t 1 b c 6 o t σ w xo χ t w ho h t 1 w co c t b o 7 h t o t tanh c t where denotes the convolution o denotes the hadamard multiplication w is the weight matrix of each layer i t is the input gate state f t is the forget gate state using to determine the proportion of the previous state c t 1 can be retained for the current moment furthermore c t is the state of the cell at the current moment and o t is the state of the output gate both c t and o t are used to determine the state of the hidden layer h t which is simultaneously input to the next unit of the same layer and the next network layer compared to the fc lstm the weight matrix is respectively multiplied by input and hidden states while the convlstm is convoluted and the spatial characteristics of hydrological data are extracted by adding convolution kernels to realize the spatiotemporal prediction we use convlstm as a basic building block the stacked convlstm extracts the highly abstract features layer by layer and then predicts by mapping them to the pixel value space in the convlstm architecture as illustrated in fig 8 the cell states are constrained inside each convlstm layer and updated horizontally the information is conveyed upwards by only the hidden states such a temporal memory flow is reasonable in supervised learning since the hidden representations can be more and more abstract from the bottom upwards according to the study of the stacked convolutional layers considering these this paper constructs a flood predictive model by stacking multi layer convlstm cells fig 9 illustrates the architecture of the proposed model which can be explained from a similar point of view as in sutskever et al 2014 and the following equation can be used to describe the multi step prediction 8 y t 1 y t 2 y t 3 arg max p y t 1 y t 2 y t 3 x t 2 x t 1 x t f decoder f encoder x t 2 x t 1 x t this architecture is also similar to the predictive model in srivastava et al 2015 which is based on the lstm however our input and output elements are all 3d tensors preserving spatial information furthermore since the network has multiple stacked convlstm layers it has strong representational power that makes it suitable for the prediction of complex dynamical systems such as the flood prediction problem we study here 4 experiment 4 1 evaluation index to minimize the material and nonmaterial losses caused by floods we must predict the arrival time and the discharge of the flood peak to evaluate the performance of our model in terms of flood peak s arrival time and discharge prediction we use the root mean squared error rmse relative error re and coefficient of determination r 2 rmse describes the average offset between the predicted and real values estimating the standard deviation of the residual error the higher the rmse the higher the predictive accuracy of the model re is the ratio between the absolute error and the real value in general re can better reflect the credibility of a model r 2 varies from 0 to 1 and a larger r 2 refers to a better fitting degree of the experimental model to the observed value 4 2 simulation result 4 2 1 determine model parameters the computer configuration and software environment used in the experiment are as follows the processor is i9 9900 k the graphics card is geforce rtx 2080 ti the memory is 64260 kb the system is ubuntu 16 04 1 64 bit the program language version is python 3 7 the integrated development environment is the anaconda lastly the model is designed based on the keras framework the pred iction accuracy of the model depends on the setting of its hyperparameters gradient descent is one of the most popular methods used to determine the optimal parameters of ml algorithms i e unconstrained optimization problems it can solve the minimum loss function and find the model parameters step by step which takes the partial derivative of the loss function concerning model parameters weight and bias the partial derivative of each parameter expressed by the vector is gradient along the opposite direction of the gradient vector that is loss w loss b the loss function decreases the fastest hence it is easier to find its minimum value the most significant factors for the gradient descent algorithm are the step size α and the descent direction the model learning rate determines whether we can find the global optimal solution with an appropriate step size as we can see from fig 10 if α is too large e g α 4 it may skip the optimal solution such as the optimal model parameter x 3 differently if the selected value is too small e g α 2 it will fall into the local optimal solution such as x 2 hence the appropriate selection of the step size is crucial in this paper we used 0 005 and 0 001 as the step size of model training and fig 11 shows the loss trend in the model training process under the used step sizes as shown the model oscillates when α is 0 001 and stabilizes when α is 0 005 therefore we use α as 0 005 in our experiments the descent direction of the algorithm largely determines whether we can find the optimal direction fig 10 shows that the loss will be higher if the algorithm chooses w a as the descent direction in practice different optimizers choose different descending directions in this paper we use adaptive moment estimation adam and stochastic gradient descent sgd as optimizers where algorithms 1 and 2 provide their pseudocodes respectively the stochastic objective function of these algorithms is the evaluation index defined in section 4 1 from the pseudocode of adam we can observe that it increases the first order momentum which is the exponential moving average of the gradient direction at each timestep in other words the descending direction at timestep t is determined by not only the gradient direction of the current timestep but also the previously accumulated descending direction which can effectively suppress the oscillation of sgd adam can also introduce a second order momentum based on sgd allowing it to update each parameter with a different learning rate that is significant for dnns with a high number of parameters which are not always available for parameters that are updated frequently we accumulate a lot of knowledge about them and we do not want to be affected too much by a single sample and hope that the learning rate will be slower we do not know much about the occasionally updated parameters hence we hope to learn more from each accidental sample which refers to a higher learning rate fig 12 illustrates the results of using sgd and adam as optimizers of the convlstm model based on the convergence speed and the performance of each optimizer shown in fig 12 adam is selected due to its timeliness in flood prediction

values of other hyperparameters we use the control variable method we know that with the increase of batch size in a certain range the faster the training speed the more accurate the direction of finding the optimal gradient descent and the smaller the fluctuation in training if the batch size is too large however it will slow down the optimization of network parameters similarly with the increase of epoch in a reasonable range network training oscillation gets smaller if the epoch is too large the network will appear over fitting a set of loss graphs shown in fig 13 is obtained through several experiments which allowed us to set the batch size and epoch of the network to 64 and 20 respectively the network width and depth are also important factors affecting the model performance the former refers to the number of neurons in a particular layer while the latter is represented by the number of layers in the network the higher the number of network layers the stronger the characterization ability however the performance enhancement slows down with the increasing number of network layers which also greatly reduces the training speed to determine the number of network layers and neurons in each layer we design the following structures for each convolution and pooling layer table 4 shows the predictive errors corresponding to various network structures where 3 3 represents the size of the convolution kernel and 40 10 1 represents the number of convolution kernels in each network layer or the neurons in the fully connected layer finally we choose a three layer convolution network with 40 10 1 convolution kernels in each layer and a superimposed three layer fully connected network with 100 60 20 neurons in each layer as the final model to be used in our experiments table 5 lists the values of each parameter used in the final model 4 2 2 results analysis to train the model we use the training and validation sets and to test it we use the data from 2017 and 2018 fig 14 shows the predictive results at the xixian station for the prediction times of the to 5 10 15 20 and 25 h respectively as table 6 reveals the predictive accuracy gradually decreases with the increasing prediction time however when the prediction time is 5 h the prediction accuracy is lower than that of longer prediction times such as 10 15 h that is mainly because when the prediction time is too short the input hydrological characteristics will be fewer resulting in less information that the model can learn which will inevitably lower the prediction accuracy to address this issue we increase the length of the input tensor enriching the information that the model can learn as fig 14 shows the model accuracy has improved when the predictive time is 5 h however the computation time will prolong as the length of the input tensor increases there are many variants of convolution and the calculation is complex most of the time is spent on convolution calculation when the neural network runs the development of the model increases the depth of the network hence it is crucial to optimize the convolution calculation otherwise reducing the complexity of the model will not be possible fig 14 shows that the flooding process predicted by the convlstm is roughly similar to the observed data when the prediction time is 10 h independent of the flood predictive model the peak value and the peak arrival time of the flood are the most concerning problems of each flood control department for a more intuitive understanding of model predictive accuracy we extract five flood processes with a discharge of more than 800 m 3 s as shown in fig 15 table 7 shows the arrival time of the actual peak the predictive peak the peak relative error the actual peak discharge the predictive peak discharge and the peak discharge relative error considering also the results in fig 14 we observe that the arrival time of the peak relative error is within 30 and the peak discharge relative error is within 20 satisfying the 2005 chinese water resource standard on flood prediction permit error press 2005 therefore the proposed convlstm model based on spatiotemporal characteristics has a good predictive effect fig 16 compares the observed discharge in the xixian station in 2017 and 2018 with the discharge predicted by convlstm and lstm models the rmse and r 2 of the lstm model are 0 0642 and 0 7432 respectively compared with table 6 the predictive accuracy of the traditional time series predictive model i e lstm is inferior to that of our model which shows that the addition of spatial characteristics to time series can improve the accuracy of the model 5 conclusion in this paper we divided a rainfall discharge area with hydrological information into grids and transformed it into an image like structure then we used the proposed convlstm model combined with image processing capabilities for flood prediction our model incorporates a typical cnn for image processing and a conventional time series predictor for extracting the spatiotemporal characteristics of hydrological information which cannot be efficiently handled by the traditional machine learning models the hydrological data e g rainfall and flow were interpolated and grouped into a dataset to train the proposed convlstm model the numerical results revealed that the convlstm could provide better predictive results than the existing methods concerning three statistical indexes therefore the proposed method is a promising alternative for improving the accuracy of medium and short term discharge prediction there are still some interesting open problems related to flood prediction based on time series which include the following our proposed model achieves comparable performance for medium and short term discharge prediction through numerical experiments however it is challenging to make a long term more than 72 h flood prediction the long term prediction with high accuracy strives for more time for various preparations for flood control although the model can make accurate predictions it has limitations such as being complex and requiring more parameters for the training which refer to more samples from the area of interest therefore flood prediction of areas with few samples needs further investigation declaration of competing interest the authors declare

3588,in this paper we introduce approximate analytical solutions for groundwater flows in semi infinite fields confined by two rectilinear boundaries both constant head or both impermeable which are intersected at an angle between 90 and 180 the solutions are based on the method of images their main special feature is that both boundary conditions are observed at the expense of the continuity of the velocity field along a particular straight line first we discuss the range of application of each solution and the validity of the results using physical arguments then we compare our results with numerical ones obtained by modflow namely an established numerical tool discrepancies are generally small the main attractive feature of the proposed approximate analytical procedures compared to numerical ones is that the computational load is much smaller at all stages a introduction of fictitious boundaries to contain the flow field is reduced to definition of the radius of influence of the wells b no grid construction is required and c calculation of the hydraulic head is conducted separately at any point of the flow field moreover accuracy of the results is good compared to that of numerical methods which depends on the dimensions of the respective grid keywords method of images groundwater flow boundary conditions approximate analytical solutions modflow euclidean geometry 1 introduction a simulation model is a tool to predict the response of a given system to natural or man induced changes quite often the term is used as equivalent with the term mathematical model namely it is interpreted as a set of mathematical relationships describing the response of a system to its environment griffiths 1999 the first step of simulation though is to conceive the system in adequate detail or to produce a realistic description of it a very good question of course is what does realistic description mean or what adequate detail is already in the 4th century bce plato stated that our approach to nature is just a plausible account or description εἰκώς λόγος this statement appears in his work timaeus which by the way introduced the well known legend of atlantis katsifarakis 2009 when there are no available analytical solutions for a mathematical model numerical solutions are the most common alternative lin et al 2016 wang et al 2017 nevertheless the respective computational volume might be too large e g due to local grid refinement around wells yang et al 2021 this is particularly important when simulation is part of an optimization process by means of meta heuristic methods redoloza and li 2019 siade et al 2019 this process requires solution of the numerical model for hundreds or even thousands of times in such cases surrogate models sreekanth and datta 2011 christelis et al 2019 or approximate analytical solutions offer an attractive alternative jankowski et al 2016 mathias et al 2008 wen et al 2013 up to now there are no analytical solutions for flows in semi infinite aquifers bounded by 2 rectilinear boundaries intersected at an angle θ between 90 and 180 the well known method of images holds for the two limiting cases θ 90 and 180 only as in its classical form it fails to satisfy both boundary conditions in this paper we introduce a set of new approximate analytical solutions for drawdown calculation in semi infinite flow fields which can be used for any angle of boundary intersection they are based on the method of images and on the idea of using two branch functions to describe the flow the main practical advantage of the new solutions over numerical methods finite differences or finite elements is that the computational load is much smaller at all stages a introduction of fictitious boundaries to contain the flow field is reduced to definition of the radius of influence of the wells b no grid construction is required and c calculation of the hydraulic head is conducted separately at any point of the flow field this is an important asset in many groundwater management problems where hydraulic head values are required at very few points only moreover accuracy of the results is as good if not better compared to that of numerical methods which depends on the dimensions of the respective grid finally the proposed set of approximate analytical solutions can be used in other physical problems e g of electrostatics magnetics etc with mathematical description similar to that of groundwater flows towards systems of wells in semi infinite aquifers 2 a short description of the method of images the method of images has been used at least since the beginning of the 20th century in problems of electricity and magnetism jeans 1925 and it is still used in these fields cheng and greengard 1998 lee and park 2002 later on it became popular in groundwater flow simulation milne thomson 1938 and is extensively presented in standard textbooks on groundwater hydraulics bear 1979 de marsily 1986 it offers analytical solutions for homogeneous semi infinite aquifers bounded by one rectilinear impermeable or constant head boundary and its use is extensive anderson 2000 anderson 2003 irsa and zhang 2012 hwang and lu 2007 katsifarakis 2008 kuo et al 1994 lim et al 2014 lin et al 2016 mantoglou 2003 steward and allen 2013 van der veer 1994 the method has been also used in other scientific fields like optics makris and christodoulides 2006 and geometrostatics misner 1963 the basic idea of the method is that a boundary can be removed by adding a number of fictitious wells symmetrical of the real ones with respect to it the relationship between the flow rate of each fictitious or image well and that of the respective real one depends on the boundary condition along the removed boundary and guarantees that it is observed suppose that there are n wells in the flow field a straight line constant head boundary is replaced by a set of n imaginary wells with opposite sign namely recharge wells are the images of pumped wells and vice versa in this way the hydraulic head level drawdown caused by any real well at any point of the boundary is compensated by the influence of its image on the other hand a rectilinear impermeable boundary is replaced by a set of n imaginary wells of the same sign in this way at any point of the boundary the velocity normal to it caused by any real well is counteracted by the velocity caused by its image the method of images can also be used in flow fields with two rectilinear boundaries provided that the angle θ which is formed by the two boundaries and contains the flow field is an integer submultiple of 180 for boundaries of the same kind or of 90 for boundaries of different kinds only for these cases the following conditions are fulfilled a the number nw of image wells is finite b all of them lie outside the real flow field and c the sign of their flow rate pumped or injected is uniquely defined nw is a function of θ and is given as 1 1 n w 360 θ 1 for instance in fig 1 ox1 is a constant head boundary and ox2 an impermeable one forming an angle θ 90 then nw 3 all of the image wells lie outside the real flow field and the sign of their flow rate is uniquely determined if the real well w is pumped image wells w2 and w3 are pumped too while w1 is a recharge well the condition on θ expressed by eq 1 1 poses a severe restriction on application of the method of images to cases of practical interest in this paper we introduce and evaluate a set of approximate analytical solutions based of the method of images and the idea of using two branch functions to describe the flow these new solutions can be used in a standard way when 180 θ 90 namely for a large range of practical problems their features are discussed in the following section 3 approximate analytical solutions based on the method of images 3 1 previous works works on approximate application of the method of images in fields with two boundaries intersecting at angles other than those resulting from eq 1 1 are quite few to our knowledge koutsourelakis et al 2006 investigated optimization of a system of 5 wells pumping from a semi infinite aquifer bounded by 2 constant head boundaries which are intersected at an angle θ 120 their aim was to choose the optimal locations of the wells in order to minimize the sum of 2 cost items a annual pumping cost and b amortization of the construction of the pipe network which connects the wells with a central water tank they combined genetic algorithms as optimization tool with an approximate form of the method of images used to simulate groundwater flow for each real well w they introduced its two images w1 and w2 with respect to the two boundaries plus one more image well w3 symmetric to the real one with respect to the point of the boundary intersection they concluded that their approximate flow simulation model allowed for proper comparison of the solutions in the framework of the optimization process tselepidou 2008 investigated a similar semi infinite aquifer with θ 120 too she considered one well w pumping at rate equal to qw and took into account its two images w1 and w2 with respect to the two boundaries she assumed that 3 1 q w 1 q w 2 aq w bq w where qw1 qw2 are the flow rates of the image wells and a b nonnegative constants fulfilling the constraint a b 1 the constraint guarantees that inflow through the constant head boundary is equal to the flow rate of the real well then she used genetic algorithms to find the combination of a b values that minimizes violation of the boundary conditions she concluded that the best combination is a 1 b 0 or a 0 b 1 namely that only the image with respect to the boundary closest to the real well should be used moreover tselepidou investigated further the heuristic approach of koutsourelakis et al 2006 assuming that 3 2 q w 1 q w 2 q w 3 aq w bq w cq w in eq 3 2 the constants a b and c fulfill the following constraints 3 3a a b c 1 3 3b 0 a b c 1 5 the constraint 3 3a is needed to guarantee that inflow through the constant head boundary is equal to the flow rate of the real well results indicate that close to each boundary the influence of the respective image well is predominant around the bisector of angle θ though the influence of both boundaries should be taken into account 3 2 the basic idea and the structure of the new approximate analytical solutions we study semi infinite flow fields which are bounded by two rectilinear boundaries ox1 and ox2 intersected at point o the angle θ ox1 ox2 which contains the real flow field is between 90 and 180 our aim is to achieve good approximation of hydraulic head distribution using a small number of fictitious wells according to the previous section the method of images offers exact analytical solutions for fields confined by a one straight line boundary which could be conceived as two boundaries intersected at an angle of 180 and b two straight line boundaries intersected at an angle of 90 in the first case one image well has to be used for each real one while 3 image wells should be used in the second we postulate then that the approximate solutions should make use of 1 to 3 image wells we name the images of the real well w as follows see fig 2 w1 its image with respect to the boundary ox1 which is closest to w w2 its image with respect to boundary ox2 w3 the image of w1 with respect to ox2 and w4 the image of w2 with respect to ox1 we call w1 and w2 first order images and w3 w4 second order images we also assume that the second order images if used should have smaller effect than the first order ones at any point of the real flow field this is discussed further in sections 4 1 2 and 4 2 4 description and applicability range of the proposed approximate solutions in the following paragraphs we present and discuss three approximate forms of the method of images and we offer guidelines for their use through application examples to steady state flows in semi infinite confined aquifers 4 1 flow fields with two rectilinear constant head boundaries in this case the first order images of a pumped well are injection wells while the second order ones are pumped wells first we have rejected the idea of using the two first order images only because it leads to erroneous results from the physical point of view for instance pumping at a flow rate equal to qw from the real well would lead to a an increase of the hydraulic head level at part of the real flow field and b a water inflow to the flow field larger than qw through the constant head boundary then we examine application of the following options a use only the first order image with respect to the boundary closest to the well w1 in fig 2 for any point of the real flow field b use of one first order image w1 for one part of the flow field and w2 for the other namely use of a two branch function to describe the hydraulic head level drawdown called in the following simply drawdown c use of both first order images for the whole flow field plus one of the second order ones to selected parts of the flow fields again a two branch function has to be used to describe drawdown 4 1 1 use of first order images only the simplest approach is to use image w1 only this approach leads to observance of the boundary condition along ox1 along ox2 though the zero drawdown condition is not observed and the deviation could be substantial if the real well is close to the bisector of θ a better approximation close to boundary ox2 can be achieved through the following approach make use of the image w1 in the major part of the flow field included between ox1 and the perpendicular bisector of the line segment w1w2 and of the image w2 for the rest the perpendicular bisector according to lemma 1 of appendix a passes through o and is shown as ox3 in fig 3 the idea is to use the first order image which is closest to the field point at which drawdown is calculated as shown in fig 3 b and 3c images w1 and w2 are used at the largest and smallest part of the field respectively since according to lemma 3 the angle ox2 ox3 is equal to the angle β ox1 ow the drawdown s at any point x y of an infinite flow field due to pumping from one well at a flow rate qw is given as 4 1 s x y 1 2 π t q w l n x x w 2 y y w 2 r in eq 4 1 t is the aquifer s transmissivity while xw yw are the coordinates of the well consequently taking into account the real and one image well and using the superposition principle we come up with the following two branch function for the drawdown at any point of the studied semi infinite flow field 4 2 s x y 1 2 π t q w ln x x w 2 y y w 2 x x w 1 2 y y w 1 2 1 2 π t q w ln x x w 2 y y w 2 x x w 2 2 y y w 2 2 in eq 4 2 xw1 yw1 and xw2 yw2 are the coordinates of the first order image wells with respect to boundaries ox1 and ox2 respectively the major advantage of this approach is that both boundary conditions are fully observed moreover the drawdown function is continuous since each point of ox3 has equal distances from w1 and w2 it should be mentioned though that observance of both boundary conditions is achieved by allowing discontinuity of the velocity field along ox3 observance of both boundary conditions increases the accuracy at the most crucial parts of the flow field it allows then use of the approximate solutions when the interaction between streams and adjacent aquifers is studied at least for preliminary estimates this is an important topic of current research smerdon et al 2012 zipper et al 2019 4 1 2 use of both first order and one second order images as stated above second order images are pumped wells then use of two first order images and one second order image lying outside the real flow field does not result in a water inflow to the flow field larger than qw through the constant head boundary we have examined then the alternate use of image wells w3 and w4 in parts of the flow field separated by the line ow which according to lemma 2 of appendix a is the perpendicular bisector of w3w4 the idea is to use w3 with the larger part of the real flow field which is close to ox2 and w4 for the rest with this approach both boundary conditions are fully observed moreover the drawdown function is continuous since each point of ow has equal distances from w3 and w4 it should be mentioned though that observance of both boundary conditions is achieved by allowing discontinuity of the velocity field along ow observance of both boundary conditions has all the advantages mentioned in the section 4 1 1 before using this approximate solution we should check whether both w3 and w4 lie outside the real flow field namely if the basic precondition for meaningful results is fulfilled according to lemma 4 of appendix a if θ 144 one or both of the second order images will be located inside the real flow field and the approximate solution cannot be used then we investigate whether this approximate solution leads to more accurate results than the simpler approximate approach of using w1 only this approach would produce the exact drawdown values if the flow field were bounded by ox1 only actual drawdown at any point of the real flow field is smaller since the boundary ox2 namely the zero drawdown condition is closer to it compared to the infinite field it follows that the introduction of the pair of wells w2 w4 should lead to smaller drawdowns at any point of the real flow field it results that the distance of the point from recharge well w2 should be smaller than that from the pumping well w4 the same should be true for the pair of wells w1 w3 according to the corollary of lemma 5 of appendix a θ 120 is a necessary condition for both first order images to be closer to any point of the real flow field than the respective second order ones let us investigate further flow fields with 90 θ 120ο according to lemma 5 both of the following conditions should hold a β φ namely ow should lie in the interior of angle ox1 ox4 of fig 4 b γ φ namely ow should lie in the interior of angle ox2 ox5 of fig 4 it results that angle δ is given as 4 3 δ o x 4 ox 5 θ 2 θ φ 2 φ θ according to 4 3 for θ 120ο δ 0 while for θ 90ο δ 90o then we should use the both first order plus one second order image approach when the real well w lies inside angle δ in this case for two pumped and two injection wells the drawdown s at any point x y is given by the following two branch function for the field sections shown in fig 5 a and 5b respectively 4 4 s x y 1 2 π t q w ln x x w 2 y y w 2 x x w 3 2 y y w 3 2 x x w 1 2 y y w 1 2 x x w 2 2 y y w 2 2 1 2 π t q w ln x x w 2 y y w 2 x x w 4 2 y y w 4 2 x x w 1 2 y y w 1 2 x x w 2 2 y y w 2 2 in eq 4 4 xw3 yw3 and xw4 yw4 are the coordinates of the second order image wells w3 and w4 respectively when the real well w lies outside angle δ only the first order image with respect to the closest boundary should be used 4 2 flow field with two rectilinear impermeable boundaries in this case both the first order and the second order images of a pumped well are pumped wells too again we have rejected the idea of using the two first order images only because it leads to erroneous results from the physical point of view for instance pumping at a flow rate equal to qw from the real well would lead to water outflow from the real flow field increasing with qw then we examine the 3 options discussed in section 4 1 for two intersecting constant head boundaries the advantages and drawbacks of using the first two options involving first order images only are exactly the same since the real and the image wells are both pumped in this case the respective two branch function for the drawdown reads 4 5 s x y 1 2 π t q w ln x x w 2 y y w 2 x x w 1 2 y y w 1 2 r 2 1 2 π t q w ln x x w 2 y y w 2 x x w 2 2 y y w 2 2 r 2 the third option deserves some further consideration if we assume that second order images should have smaller effect than the first order ones then the analysis of section 4 1 2 is valid nevertheless this assumption has no physical basis in the case of impermeable boundaries since all images are pumped wells then we propose the use of both first order and one second order images as described in section 4 1 2 but with one restriction only the second order images should lie outside the real flow field this restriction cannot be fulfilled if θ greater than 144ο according to lemma 4 of appendix a while it is guaranteed if θ 120ο since all real and image wells are both pumped in this case the respective two branch function for the drawdown reads 4 6 s x y 1 2 π t q w ln j x x j 2 y y j 2 r 4 for j w w 1 w 2 w 3 1 2 π t q w ln j x x j 2 y y j 2 r 4 f o r j w w 1 w 2 w 4 5 evaluation of the quality of the results the best way to evaluate approximate solutions is to compare their results with those of exact solutions for special cases aghlmand and abbasi 2019 malekzadeh et al 2019 in this framework we mention the following a as angle θ approaches 180 the distance between the two first order image wells w1 and w2 decreases until they coincide for θ 180 as angle θ approaches 90 the distance between the two second order image wells w3 and w4 diminishes until they coincide for θ 90 moreover angle δ increases until it becomes equal to θ for θ 90 it follows that the proposed approximate analytical solutions reproduce the exact ones for the limiting cases 5 1 comparison with numerical results to evaluate further the proposed approximate analytical solutions we compare results with those obtained by modflow 2005 namely an established numerical tool for groundwater flows harbaugh 2005 harbaugh et al 2017 while numerical results are inherently approximate too favorable comparison can offer additional confidence while large discrepancies may indicate inaccuracies in either or both of them huang et al 2018 we consider 7 cases of semi infinite confined aquifers bounded by two rectilinear boundaries intersecting at the point o 0 3000 one of them is described by the equation x 0 a well with coordinates 300 2800 pumps at a flow rate qw 0 05 m3 s we consider steady state flow conditions in order to facilitate calculations and comparisons the hydraulic parameters of the well and the aquifer are listed below a radius of the well r0 0 4 m b hydraulic conductivity κ 0 00005 m s c thickness of aquifer a 50 m to use modflow we have added two fictitious constant head boundaries at a large distance from the well they are described by the equations y 0 and x 3000 respectively moreover we have used the well package with coordinates 299 2800 we have run modflow using a 10 10 and a 5 5 grid and we compared the results with those of the proposed approximate analytical solutions at two sets of points shown in fig 6 they lie on two straight lines ε1 y 2800 and ε2 x 300 which intersect at the well first we considered 4 cases with two constant head boundaries intersecting at angles θ 90ο 100 120 and 140 respectively the radius of influence of the well does not enter the calculations for such boundaries case 1 θ 90 in this case the method of images is exact discrepancies then are due to the approximate nature of the numerical solution the obtained drawdown values sa and sm from the approximate analytical solutions and modflow respectively are summarized in tables 1 and 2 of appendix b we observe the following a the analytical solution generally renders larger drawdown values than modflow b modflow renders results closer to the analytical ones when the finer grid 5 5 is used c the discrepancies are smaller than 5 where the drawdown is substantial larger than 3 m except for the location of the well where it exceeds 10 even for the finer grid this is not surprising since in the numerical solution the well flow rate concentrated load is represented less accurately case 2 θ 100ο the obtained drawdown values are summarized in tables 3 and 4 of appendix b we observe the following a the approximate analytical solutions render larger drawdown values than modflow b modflow results are always closer to those of the 3 image solution than to those of the 1 image solution c results of the 3 image solution are generally closer to modflow results obtained using the finer grid than those obtained using the coarser grid d the discrepancies are close to 6 where the drawdown is substantial larger than 3 m except for the location of the well where it exceeds 14 even for the finer grid we can assume that the maximum drawdown value rendered by the approximate analytical solution is more accurate since as mentioned above in the numerical solution the well flow rate concentrated load is represented less accurately moreover the modelmuse winston 2009 winston 2020 a graphical user interface for groundwater models has been used in order to visualize the results drawdowns have been calculated by both methods on all grid nodes in this way fig 7 has been produced equipotential lines lines of equal drawdown look quite similar case 3 θ 120ο in this case the approximate analytical solution entails use of one image well only as discussed in section 4 the obtained drawdown values are summarized in tables 5 and 6 of appendix b we observe the following a the approximate analytical solution renders larger drawdown values than modflow b modflow renders results closer to those of the approximate analytical solution when the finer grid 5 5 is used c the discrepancies are close to 6 where the drawdown is substantial larger than 3 m moreover we can assume that the maximum drawdown value rendered by the approximate analytical solution is more accurate since as mentioned above in the numerical solution the well flow rate concentrated load is represented less accurately case 4 θ 140ο the obtained drawdown values for this case are summarized in tables 7 and 8 of appendix b comparison of the results leads to comments similar to those of case 3 the only difference is that discrepancies may exceed 10 where the drawdown is substantial moreover we considered 3 cases with impermeable boundaries intersecting at angles θ 90ο 100 and 120 respectively for the approximate analytical solution we have checked two values for the radius of influence namely r 2700 m and r 3000 m which are compatible with the placement of the fictitious boundaries in the modflow solution the comments per case follow case 5 θ 90ο in this case the method of images is exact regarding the number and the locations of the image wells nevertheless results depend on the choice of r the obtained drawdown values sa and sm are summarized in tables 9 and 10 of appendix b we observe the following a the analytical solution generally renders smaller drawdown values than modflow for both r except for the location of the well b the analytical results are closer to those of modflow when the value r 3000 is used d the discrepancies are smaller than 4 5 case 6 θ 100ο the obtained drawdown values are summarized in tables 11 and 12 of appendix b we observe the following a the approximate analytical 3 image solution renders larger drawdown values than modflow for r 3000 m moreover they are closer to those obtained using the coarser grid b the approximate analytical 3 image solution renders smaller drawdown values than modflow for r 2700 m except for the location of the well moreover they are closer to those obtained using the finer grid the respective discrepancies are small namely close or 1 in most of the flow field c at the location of the well the approximate analytical solution exceeds the numerical one 7 we can assume that the maximum drawdown value rendered by the approximate analytical solution is more accurate as mentioned in previous cases case 7 θ 120ο in this case the approximate analytical solution entails use of one image well only the obtained drawdown values are summarized in tables 13 and 14 of appendix b we observe the following a the approximate analytical solutions render smaller drawdown values than modflow for both r values b modflow renders results closer to those of the approximate analytical solution when the finer grid 5 5 is used c the discrepancies are generally large in particular when r 2700 m the comparison between the drawdowns sa and sm along the line ε1 is summarized in figs 8 and 9 for the constant head and the impermeable boundaries respectively on the y axis of figs 8a and 9a the differences sa sm are shown while in figs 8b and 9b the respective reduced differences sa sm sa are shown 6 conclusions in this paper approximate forms of the method of images have been introduced for semi infinite flow fields with two rectilinear boundaries either both impermeable or both constant head ones which are intersected at an angle θ between 90 and 180 one or three image wells are used which may be different for different sections of the flow field the major advantage of this approach is that both boundary conditions are fully observed continuity of the hydraulic head drawdown function is preserved since a the image wells w1 and w2 or w3 and w4 which are alternately used have equal flow rates and b the calculation formula changes along ox3 the perpendicular bisector of the line segment defined by the these images the price though for the observance of both boundary conditions is that the velocity field is discontinuous along ox3 the results can be considered as dependable for the following reasons a the approximate solutions coincide with the exact ones for the two limiting cases θ 90 and 180 respectively and b results compare favorably with those obtained numerically in particular when a fine grid is used it should be mentioned though that the value of the radius of influence has to be carefully selected if the flow field is bound by impermeable boundaries the main practical advantage of the proposed approximate analytical solutions is their low computational load which is very important in particular when they are combined with metaheuristic optimization tools to optimize groundwater resources management declaration of competing interest the authors

w3w4 according to lemma 1 moreover a the quadrilateral ww1w3w2 is an isosceles trapezoid since ox2 is the perpendicular bisector of both w1w3 and ww2 then its diagonals ww3 and w1w2 are equal b the quadrilateral ww1w2w4 is an isosceles trapezoid since ox1 is the perpendicular bisector of both ww1 and w2w4 then its sides ww4 and w1w2 are equal to each other it follows that ww3 ww4 namely w is on

3588,in this paper we introduce approximate analytical solutions for groundwater flows in semi infinite fields confined by two rectilinear boundaries both constant head or both impermeable which are intersected at an angle between 90 and 180 the solutions are based on the method of images their main special feature is that both boundary conditions are observed at the expense of the continuity of the velocity field along a particular straight line first we discuss the range of application of each solution and the validity of the results using physical arguments then we compare our results with numerical ones obtained by modflow namely an established numerical tool discrepancies are generally small the main attractive feature of the proposed approximate analytical procedures compared to numerical ones is that the computational load is much smaller at all stages a introduction of fictitious boundaries to contain the flow field is reduced to definition of the radius of influence of the wells b no grid construction is required and c calculation of the hydraulic head is conducted separately at any point of the flow field moreover accuracy of the results is good compared to that of numerical methods which depends on the dimensions of the respective grid keywords method of images groundwater flow boundary conditions approximate analytical solutions modflow euclidean geometry 1 introduction a simulation model is a tool to predict the response of a given system to natural or man induced changes quite often the term is used as equivalent with the term mathematical model namely it is interpreted as a set of mathematical relationships describing the response of a system to its environment griffiths 1999 the first step of simulation though is to conceive the system in adequate detail or to produce a realistic description of it a very good question of course is what does realistic description mean or what adequate detail is already in the 4th century bce plato stated that our approach to nature is just a plausible account or description εἰκώς λόγος this statement appears in his work timaeus which by the way introduced the well known legend of atlantis katsifarakis 2009 when there are no available analytical solutions for a mathematical model numerical solutions are the most common alternative lin et al 2016 wang et al 2017 nevertheless the respective computational volume might be too large e g due to local grid refinement around wells yang et al 2021 this is particularly important when simulation is part of an optimization process by means of meta heuristic methods redoloza and li 2019 siade et al 2019 this process requires solution of the numerical model for hundreds or even thousands of times in such cases surrogate models sreekanth and datta 2011 christelis et al 2019 or approximate analytical solutions offer an attractive alternative jankowski et al 2016 mathias et al 2008 wen et al 2013 up to now there are no analytical solutions for flows in semi infinite aquifers bounded by 2 rectilinear boundaries intersected at an angle θ between 90 and 180 the well known method of images holds for the two limiting cases θ 90 and 180 only as in its classical form it fails to satisfy both boundary conditions in this paper we introduce a set of new approximate analytical solutions for drawdown calculation in semi infinite flow fields which can be used for any angle of boundary intersection they are based on the method of images and on the idea of using two branch functions to describe the flow the main practical advantage of the new solutions over numerical methods finite differences or finite elements is that the computational load is much smaller at all stages a introduction of fictitious boundaries to contain the flow field is reduced to definition of the radius of influence of the wells b no grid construction is required and c calculation of the hydraulic head is conducted separately at any point of the flow field this is an important asset in many groundwater management problems where hydraulic head values are required at very few points only moreover accuracy of the results is as good if not better compared to that of numerical methods which depends on the dimensions of the respective grid finally the proposed set of approximate analytical solutions can be used in other physical problems e g of electrostatics magnetics etc with mathematical description similar to that of groundwater flows towards systems of wells in semi infinite aquifers 2 a short description of the method of images the method of images has been used at least since the beginning of the 20th century in problems of electricity and magnetism jeans 1925 and it is still used in these fields cheng and greengard 1998 lee and park 2002 later on it became popular in groundwater flow simulation milne thomson 1938 and is extensively presented in standard textbooks on groundwater hydraulics bear 1979 de marsily 1986 it offers analytical solutions for homogeneous semi infinite aquifers bounded by one rectilinear impermeable or constant head boundary and its use is extensive anderson 2000 anderson 2003 irsa and zhang 2012 hwang and lu 2007 katsifarakis 2008 kuo et al 1994 lim et al 2014 lin et al 2016 mantoglou 2003 steward and allen 2013 van der veer 1994 the method has been also used in other scientific fields like optics makris and christodoulides 2006 and geometrostatics misner 1963 the basic idea of the method is that a boundary can be removed by adding a number of fictitious wells symmetrical of the real ones with respect to it the relationship between the flow rate of each fictitious or image well and that of the respective real one depends on the boundary condition along the removed boundary and guarantees that it is observed suppose that there are n wells in the flow field a straight line constant head boundary is replaced by a set of n imaginary wells with opposite sign namely recharge wells are the images of pumped wells and vice versa in this way the hydraulic head level drawdown caused by any real well at any point of the boundary is compensated by the influence of its image on the other hand a rectilinear impermeable boundary is replaced by a set of n imaginary wells of the same sign in this way at any point of the boundary the velocity normal to it caused by any real well is counteracted by the velocity caused by its image the method of images can also be used in flow fields with two rectilinear boundaries provided that the angle θ which is formed by the two boundaries and contains the flow field is an integer submultiple of 180 for boundaries of the same kind or of 90 for boundaries of different kinds only for these cases the following conditions are fulfilled a the number nw of image wells is finite b all of them lie outside the real flow field and c the sign of their flow rate pumped or injected is uniquely defined nw is a function of θ and is given as 1 1 n w 360 θ 1 for instance in fig 1 ox1 is a constant head boundary and ox2 an impermeable one forming an angle θ 90 then nw 3 all of the image wells lie outside the real flow field and the sign of their flow rate is uniquely determined if the real well w is pumped image wells w2 and w3 are pumped too while w1 is a recharge well the condition on θ expressed by eq 1 1 poses a severe restriction on application of the method of images to cases of practical interest in this paper we introduce and evaluate a set of approximate analytical solutions based of the method of images and the idea of using two branch functions to describe the flow these new solutions can be used in a standard way when 180 θ 90 namely for a large range of practical problems their features are discussed in the following section 3 approximate analytical solutions based on the method of images 3 1 previous works works on approximate application of the method of images in fields with two boundaries intersecting at angles other than those resulting from eq 1 1 are quite few to our knowledge koutsourelakis et al 2006 investigated optimization of a system of 5 wells pumping from a semi infinite aquifer bounded by 2 constant head boundaries which are intersected at an angle θ 120 their aim was to choose the optimal locations of the wells in order to minimize the sum of 2 cost items a annual pumping cost and b amortization of the construction of the pipe network which connects the wells with a central water tank they combined genetic algorithms as optimization tool with an approximate form of the method of images used to simulate groundwater flow for each real well w they introduced its two images w1 and w2 with respect to the two boundaries plus one more image well w3 symmetric to the real one with respect to the point of the boundary intersection they concluded that their approximate flow simulation model allowed for proper comparison of the solutions in the framework of the optimization process tselepidou 2008 investigated a similar semi infinite aquifer with θ 120 too she considered one well w pumping at rate equal to qw and took into account its two images w1 and w2 with respect to the two boundaries she assumed that 3 1 q w 1 q w 2 aq w bq w where qw1 qw2 are the flow rates of the image wells and a b nonnegative constants fulfilling the constraint a b 1 the constraint guarantees that inflow through the constant head boundary is equal to the flow rate of the real well then she used genetic algorithms to find the combination of a b values that minimizes violation of the boundary conditions she concluded that the best combination is a 1 b 0 or a 0 b 1 namely that only the image with respect to the boundary closest to the real well should be used moreover tselepidou investigated further the heuristic approach of koutsourelakis et al 2006 assuming that 3 2 q w 1 q w 2 q w 3 aq w bq w cq w in eq 3 2 the constants a b and c fulfill the following constraints 3 3a a b c 1 3 3b 0 a b c 1 5 the constraint 3 3a is needed to guarantee that inflow through the constant head boundary is equal to the flow rate of the real well results indicate that close to each boundary the influence of the respective image well is predominant around the bisector of angle θ though the influence of both boundaries should be taken into account 3 2 the basic idea and the structure of the new approximate analytical solutions we study semi infinite flow fields which are bounded by two rectilinear boundaries ox1 and ox2 intersected at point o the angle θ ox1 ox2 which contains the real flow field is between 90 and 180 our aim is to achieve good approximation of hydraulic head distribution using a small number of fictitious wells according to the previous section the method of images offers exact analytical solutions for fields confined by a one straight line boundary which could be conceived as two boundaries intersected at an angle of 180 and b two straight line boundaries intersected at an angle of 90 in the first case one image well has to be used for each real one while 3 image wells should be used in the second we postulate then that the approximate solutions should make use of 1 to 3 image wells we name the images of the real well w as follows see fig 2 w1 its image with respect to the boundary ox1 which is closest to w w2 its image with respect to boundary ox2 w3 the image of w1 with respect to ox2 and w4 the image of w2 with respect to ox1 we call w1 and w2 first order images and w3 w4 second order images we also assume that the second order images if used should have smaller effect than the first order ones at any point of the real flow field this is discussed further in sections 4 1 2 and 4 2 4 description and applicability range of the proposed approximate solutions in the following paragraphs we present and discuss three approximate forms of the method of images and we offer guidelines for their use through application examples to steady state flows in semi infinite confined aquifers 4 1 flow fields with two rectilinear constant head boundaries in this case the first order images of a pumped well are injection wells while the second order ones are pumped wells first we have rejected the idea of using the two first order images only because it leads to erroneous results from the physical point of view for instance pumping at a flow rate equal to qw from the real well would lead to a an increase of the hydraulic head level at part of the real flow field and b a water inflow to the flow field larger than qw through the constant head boundary then we examine application of the following options a use only the first order image with respect to the boundary closest to the well w1 in fig 2 for any point of the real flow field b use of one first order image w1 for one part of the flow field and w2 for the other namely use of a two branch function to describe the hydraulic head level drawdown called in the following simply drawdown c use of both first order images for the whole flow field plus one of the second order ones to selected parts of the flow fields again a two branch function has to be used to describe drawdown 4 1 1 use of first order images only the simplest approach is to use image w1 only this approach leads to observance of the boundary condition along ox1 along ox2 though the zero drawdown condition is not observed and the deviation could be substantial if the real well is close to the bisector of θ a better approximation close to boundary ox2 can be achieved through the following approach make use of the image w1 in the major part of the flow field included between ox1 and the perpendicular bisector of the line segment w1w2 and of the image w2 for the rest the perpendicular bisector according to lemma 1 of appendix a passes through o and is shown as ox3 in fig 3 the idea is to use the first order image which is closest to the field point at which drawdown is calculated as shown in fig 3 b and 3c images w1 and w2 are used at the largest and smallest part of the field respectively since according to lemma 3 the angle ox2 ox3 is equal to the angle β ox1 ow the drawdown s at any point x y of an infinite flow field due to pumping from one well at a flow rate qw is given as 4 1 s x y 1 2 π t q w l n x x w 2 y y w 2 r in eq 4 1 t is the aquifer s transmissivity while xw yw are the coordinates of the well consequently taking into account the real and one image well and using the superposition principle we come up with the following two branch function for the drawdown at any point of the studied semi infinite flow field 4 2 s x y 1 2 π t q w ln x x w 2 y y w 2 x x w 1 2 y y w 1 2 1 2 π t q w ln x x w 2 y y w 2 x x w 2 2 y y w 2 2 in eq 4 2 xw1 yw1 and xw2 yw2 are the coordinates of the first order image wells with respect to boundaries ox1 and ox2 respectively the major advantage of this approach is that both boundary conditions are fully observed moreover the drawdown function is continuous since each point of ox3 has equal distances from w1 and w2 it should be mentioned though that observance of both boundary conditions is achieved by allowing discontinuity of the velocity field along ox3 observance of both boundary conditions increases the accuracy at the most crucial parts of the flow field it allows then use of the approximate solutions when the interaction between streams and adjacent aquifers is studied at least for preliminary estimates this is an important topic of current research smerdon et al 2012 zipper et al 2019 4 1 2 use of both first order and one second order images as stated above second order images are pumped wells then use of two first order images and one second order image lying outside the real flow field does not result in a water inflow to the flow field larger than qw through the constant head boundary we have examined then the alternate use of image wells w3 and w4 in parts of the flow field separated by the line ow which according to lemma 2 of appendix a is the perpendicular bisector of w3w4 the idea is to use w3 with the larger part of the real flow field which is close to ox2 and w4 for the rest with this approach both boundary conditions are fully observed moreover the drawdown function is continuous since each point of ow has equal distances from w3 and w4 it should be mentioned though that observance of both boundary conditions is achieved by allowing discontinuity of the velocity field along ow observance of both boundary conditions has all the advantages mentioned in the section 4 1 1 before using this approximate solution we should check whether both w3 and w4 lie outside the real flow field namely if the basic precondition for meaningful results is fulfilled according to lemma 4 of appendix a if θ 144 one or both of the second order images will be located inside the real flow field and the approximate solution cannot be used then we investigate whether this approximate solution leads to more accurate results than the simpler approximate approach of using w1 only this approach would produce the exact drawdown values if the flow field were bounded by ox1 only actual drawdown at any point of the real flow field is smaller since the boundary ox2 namely the zero drawdown condition is closer to it compared to the infinite field it follows that the introduction of the pair of wells w2 w4 should lead to smaller drawdowns at any point of the real flow field it results that the distance of the point from recharge well w2 should be smaller than that from the pumping well w4 the same should be true for the pair of wells w1 w3 according to the corollary of lemma 5 of appendix a θ 120 is a necessary condition for both first order images to be closer to any point of the real flow field than the respective second order ones let us investigate further flow fields with 90 θ 120ο according to lemma 5 both of the following conditions should hold a β φ namely ow should lie in the interior of angle ox1 ox4 of fig 4 b γ φ namely ow should lie in the interior of angle ox2 ox5 of fig 4 it results that angle δ is given as 4 3 δ o x 4 ox 5 θ 2 θ φ 2 φ θ according to 4 3 for θ 120ο δ 0 while for θ 90ο δ 90o then we should use the both first order plus one second order image approach when the real well w lies inside angle δ in this case for two pumped and two injection wells the drawdown s at any point x y is given by the following two branch function for the field sections shown in fig 5 a and 5b respectively 4 4 s x y 1 2 π t q w ln x x w 2 y y w 2 x x w 3 2 y y w 3 2 x x w 1 2 y y w 1 2 x x w 2 2 y y w 2 2 1 2 π t q w ln x x w 2 y y w 2 x x w 4 2 y y w 4 2 x x w 1 2 y y w 1 2 x x w 2 2 y y w 2 2 in eq 4 4 xw3 yw3 and xw4 yw4 are the coordinates of the second order image wells w3 and w4 respectively when the real well w lies outside angle δ only the first order image with respect to the closest boundary should be used 4 2 flow field with two rectilinear impermeable boundaries in this case both the first order and the second order images of a pumped well are pumped wells too again we have rejected the idea of using the two first order images only because it leads to erroneous results from the physical point of view for instance pumping at a flow rate equal to qw from the real well would lead to water outflow from the real flow field increasing with qw then we examine the 3 options discussed in section 4 1 for two intersecting constant head boundaries the advantages and drawbacks of using the first two options involving first order images only are exactly the same since the real and the image wells are both pumped in this case the respective two branch function for the drawdown reads 4 5 s x y 1 2 π t q w ln x x w 2 y y w 2 x x w 1 2 y y w 1 2 r 2 1 2 π t q w ln x x w 2 y y w 2 x x w 2 2 y y w 2 2 r 2 the third option deserves some further consideration if we assume that second order images should have smaller effect than the first order ones then the analysis of section 4 1 2 is valid nevertheless this assumption has no physical basis in the case of impermeable boundaries since all images are pumped wells then we propose the use of both first order and one second order images as described in section 4 1 2 but with one restriction only the second order images should lie outside the real flow field this restriction cannot be fulfilled if θ greater than 144ο according to lemma 4 of appendix a while it is guaranteed if θ 120ο since all real and image wells are both pumped in this case the respective two branch function for the drawdown reads 4 6 s x y 1 2 π t q w ln j x x j 2 y y j 2 r 4 for j w w 1 w 2 w 3 1 2 π t q w ln j x x j 2 y y j 2 r 4 f o r j w w 1 w 2 w 4 5 evaluation of the quality of the results the best way to evaluate approximate solutions is to compare their results with those of exact solutions for special cases aghlmand and abbasi 2019 malekzadeh et al 2019 in this framework we mention the following a as angle θ approaches 180 the distance between the two first order image wells w1 and w2 decreases until they coincide for θ 180 as angle θ approaches 90 the distance between the two second order image wells w3 and w4 diminishes until they coincide for θ 90 moreover angle δ increases until it becomes equal to θ for θ 90 it follows that the proposed approximate analytical solutions reproduce the exact ones for the limiting cases 5 1 comparison with numerical results to evaluate further the proposed approximate analytical solutions we compare results with those obtained by modflow 2005 namely an established numerical tool for groundwater flows harbaugh 2005 harbaugh et al 2017 while numerical results are inherently approximate too favorable comparison can offer additional confidence while large discrepancies may indicate inaccuracies in either or both of them huang et al 2018 we consider 7 cases of semi infinite confined aquifers bounded by two rectilinear boundaries intersecting at the point o 0 3000 one of them is described by the equation x 0 a well with coordinates 300 2800 pumps at a flow rate qw 0 05 m3 s we consider steady state flow conditions in order to facilitate calculations and comparisons the hydraulic parameters of the well and the aquifer are listed below a radius of the well r0 0 4 m b hydraulic conductivity κ 0 00005 m s c thickness of aquifer a 50 m to use modflow we have added two fictitious constant head boundaries at a large distance from the well they are described by the equations y 0 and x 3000 respectively moreover we have used the well package with coordinates 299 2800 we have run modflow using a 10 10 and a 5 5 grid and we compared the results with those of the proposed approximate analytical solutions at two sets of points shown in fig 6 they lie on two straight lines ε1 y 2800 and ε2 x 300 which intersect at the well first we considered 4 cases with two constant head boundaries intersecting at angles θ 90ο 100 120 and 140 respectively the radius of influence of the well does not enter the calculations for such boundaries case 1 θ 90 in this case the method of images is exact discrepancies then are due to the approximate nature of the numerical solution the obtained drawdown values sa and sm from the approximate analytical solutions and modflow respectively are summarized in tables 1 and 2 of appendix b we observe the following a the analytical solution generally renders larger drawdown values than modflow b modflow renders results closer to the analytical ones when the finer grid 5 5 is used c the discrepancies are smaller than 5 where the drawdown is substantial larger than 3 m except for the location of the well where it exceeds 10 even for the finer grid this is not surprising since in the numerical solution the well flow rate concentrated load is represented less accurately case 2 θ 100ο the obtained drawdown values are summarized in tables 3 and 4 of appendix b we observe the following a the approximate analytical solutions render larger drawdown values than modflow b modflow results are always closer to those of the 3 image solution than to those of the 1 image solution c results of the 3 image solution are generally closer to modflow results obtained using the finer grid than those obtained using the coarser grid d the discrepancies are close to 6 where the drawdown is substantial larger than 3 m except for the location of the well where it exceeds 14 even for the finer grid we can assume that the maximum drawdown value rendered by the approximate analytical solution is more accurate since as mentioned above in the numerical solution the well flow rate concentrated load is represented less accurately moreover the modelmuse winston 2009 winston 2020 a graphical user interface for groundwater models has been used in order to visualize the results drawdowns have been calculated by both methods on all grid nodes in this way fig 7 has been produced equipotential lines lines of equal drawdown look quite similar case 3 θ 120ο in this case the approximate analytical solution entails use of one image well only as discussed in section 4 the obtained drawdown values are summarized in tables 5 and 6 of appendix b we observe the following a the approximate analytical solution renders larger drawdown values than modflow b modflow renders results closer to those of the approximate analytical solution when the finer grid 5 5 is used c the discrepancies are close to 6 where the drawdown is substantial larger than 3 m moreover we can assume that the maximum drawdown value rendered by the approximate analytical solution is more accurate since as mentioned above in the numerical solution the well flow rate concentrated load is represented less accurately case 4 θ 140ο the obtained drawdown values for this case are summarized in tables 7 and 8 of appendix b comparison of the results leads to comments similar to those of case 3 the only difference is that discrepancies may exceed 10 where the drawdown is substantial moreover we considered 3 cases with impermeable boundaries intersecting at angles θ 90ο 100 and 120 respectively for the approximate analytical solution we have checked two values for the radius of influence namely r 2700 m and r 3000 m which are compatible with the placement of the fictitious boundaries in the modflow solution the comments per case follow case 5 θ 90ο in this case the method of images is exact regarding the number and the locations of the image wells nevertheless results depend on the choice of r the obtained drawdown values sa and sm are summarized in tables 9 and 10 of appendix b we observe the following a the analytical solution generally renders smaller drawdown values than modflow for both r except for the location of the well b the analytical results are closer to those of modflow when the value r 3000 is used d the discrepancies are smaller than 4 5 case 6 θ 100ο the obtained drawdown values are summarized in tables 11 and 12 of appendix b we observe the following a the approximate analytical 3 image solution renders larger drawdown values than modflow for r 3000 m moreover they are closer to those obtained using the coarser grid b the approximate analytical 3 image solution renders smaller drawdown values than modflow for r 2700 m except for the location of the well moreover they are closer to those obtained using the finer grid the respective discrepancies are small namely close or 1 in most of the flow field c at the location of the well the approximate analytical solution exceeds the numerical one 7 we can assume that the maximum drawdown value rendered by the approximate analytical solution is more accurate as mentioned in previous cases case 7 θ 120ο in this case the approximate analytical solution entails use of one image well only the obtained drawdown values are summarized in tables 13 and 14 of appendix b we observe the following a the approximate analytical solutions render smaller drawdown values than modflow for both r values b modflow renders results closer to those of the approximate analytical solution when the finer grid 5 5 is used c the discrepancies are generally large in particular when r 2700 m the comparison between the drawdowns sa and sm along the line ε1 is summarized in figs 8 and 9 for the constant head and the impermeable boundaries respectively on the y axis of figs 8a and 9a the differences sa sm are shown while in figs 8b and 9b the respective reduced differences sa sm sa are shown 6 conclusions in this paper approximate forms of the method of images have been introduced for semi infinite flow fields with two rectilinear boundaries either both impermeable or both constant head ones which are intersected at an angle θ between 90 and 180 one or three image wells are used which may be different for different sections of the flow field the major advantage of this approach is that both boundary conditions are fully observed continuity of the hydraulic head drawdown function is preserved since a the image wells w1 and w2 or w3 and w4 which are alternately used have equal flow rates and b the calculation formula changes along ox3 the perpendicular bisector of the line segment defined by the these images the price though for the observance of both boundary conditions is that the velocity field is discontinuous along ox3 the results can be considered as dependable for the following reasons a the approximate solutions coincide with the exact ones for the two limiting cases θ 90 and 180 respectively and b results compare favorably with those obtained numerically in particular when a fine grid is used it should be mentioned though that the value of the radius of influence has to be carefully selected if the flow field is bound by impermeable boundaries the main practical advantage of the proposed approximate analytical solutions is their low computational load which is very important in particular when they are combined with metaheuristic optimization tools to optimize groundwater resources management declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper appendix a simple lemmas from the euclidean geometry the following lemmas can be easily proved fig a1 lemma 1 all image wells are located on a circle having o as center and radius equal to ow proof it follows from the definition of the method of images that o lies on the perpendicular bisector of the line segments ww1 ww2 w1w3 and w2w4 lemma 2 ow is the perpendicular bisector of w3w4 proof o is on the perpendicular bisector of w3w4 according to lemma 1 moreover a the quadrilateral ww1w3w2 is an isosceles trapezoid since ox2 is the perpendicular bisector of both w1w3 and ww2 then its diagonals ww3 and w1w2 are equal b the quadrilateral ww1w2w4 is an isosceles trapezoid since ox1 is the perpendicular bisector of both ww1 and w2w4 then its sides ww4 and w1w2 are equal to each other it follows that ww3 ww4 namely w is on the perpendicular bisector of w3w4 together with o lemma 3 the angle ox2 ox3 is equal to the angle β ox1 ow proof consider circle o ow β is half of the central angle ow ow1 therefore it is equal to the inscribed angle w2w1 w2w but ox2 ox3 is equal to w2w1 w2w because their sides are vertical to each other lemma 4 if θ 144o one or both of the second order images will be located inside the real

3589,reservoir ecological operation creates artificial hydrological and hydrodynamic conditions to meet the demand of fish during key life periods which provides eco environmental protection to alleviate the negative impact of hydropower development on ecosystems however based on practical ecological operation experience the flow experiments were rough in terms of plan design most of which were implemented over short time frames and circumstances where downstream flow conditions existed were inconsistent with fish requirements during periods affected by different local reservoir operation conditions this finding suggests that current ecological operations leave considerable space for strategy refinement this study proposed a methodology for designing refined operation strategies incorporating more ecological demands into reservoir operation releases to create and improve suitable ecological conditions for the spawning of representative fish species a joint water quantity operation model of cascade reservoirs and an under dam river hydrodynamic model coupling the operation conditions of hydroelectric generators was built the proposed methodology was applied to the three gorges dam tgd and gezhouba gzb dam cascade reservoirs in china the simulation results indicated that 1 in most cases the target of continuous flow increase on an hourly scale could be simply accomplished via hourly joint water quantity operation of tgd gzb cascade reservoirs 2 maintenance of the average dajiang and erjiang generator output during the spawning period of chinese sturgeon at a high outflow of 15000 m3 s could more effectively expand the integrated suitable space of chinese sturgeon we aimed to provide suggestions and references suitable for cascade reservoirs in china and worldwide to develop and optimize ecological operation conditions in more refined and diverse ways keywords cascade reservoir ecological operation refined strategy four major chinese carps chinese sturgeon 1 introduction the development of hydropower cascade reservoirs is the main method for utilizing water resources worldwide approximately two thirds of the world s rivers contain a large number of cascade hydropower stations grill et al 2019 which promote flood control power generation irrigation navigation and water supply hogeboom et al 2018 huang et al 2018 jaramillo and destouni 2015 nguyen tien et al 2018 shang et al 2019 with the successive commitments to being carbon neutral among the major global economies hydropower as a clean and renewable energy source plays a vital role in the transition to clean low carbon safe and high efficiency energy systems dranka and ferreira 2018 kuriqi et al 2020 li et al 2020 e g the annual multiyear regulation power station is charged with assuring peak regulation and frequency regulation with flexibility in the power grid deng et al 2019b zhang et al 2019 however cascade hydropower development has inevitably altered the natural environment of rivers driving habitat condition changes such as longitudinal connectivity loss water depletion downstream of the diversion and water temperature variations thereby negatively impacting river ecosystems kuriqi et al 2021 tao et al 2020 wen et al 2018 in regard to large scale water control projects involving cascade hydropower stations reservoirs exhibit an enormous capacity to regulate natural runoff which drastically alters the natural hydrological regime destroys the normal biorhythm of aquatic organisms such as fish and further exacerbates adverse impacts on downstream river ecosystems wang et al 2018 therefore the widespread concern across river management hydropower generation and environmental research focused on embedding indispensable environmental flow designs within the reoperation of existing dams to preserve riverine ecosystems and support the sustainable development of hydropower arthington et al 2018 kuriqi et al 2019a kuriqi et al 2019b opperman et al 2018 since the 1970s western countries have focused on the notable ecological and environmental issues caused by hydropower stations and have carried out research and implemented large scale flow experiments downstream of dams konrad et al 2011 olden et al 2014 owusu et al 2021 thompson et al 2018 for example the hume reservoir in the murray river australia restored certain small to medium level floods that increased the timing of peaks and duration of floods to trigger the spawning and recruitment of native golden and silver perch from mid october until mid december 2005 king et

hydrologic factors associated with the spawning of the four major chinese carps fmcc wang et al 2014 used genetic programming to identify important environmental factors including flow increase duration and flow increase rate that influence fmcc spawning and larval abundance yi et al 2010 stated that varying daily discharge increase levels were required to achieve different initial discharge levels during the reproductive season of carp species ban et al 2018 showed that optimizing the power discharge allocation of the gezhouba gzb dam could improve the hydrodynamic conditions for spawning chinese sturgeon acipenser sinensis since the suitable local hydrodynamic conditions of the spawning habitat require a high flow pulse yang et al 2021 used a hierarchical model incorporating the flow thermal parameters water quality and their complex interaction effects in six hydropower stations on the middle reach of the yangtze river suggesting that water releases should be performed in a timely manner during fish gonadal development wang et al 2021 proposed reservoir outflow variations across different time scales ovdts as a novel indicator to optimize reservoir operating rule curves considering the full life cycles of fish in the danjiangkou reservoir considering these executed large scale flow experiments we found that these experiments for dam reoperation were rough in terms of plan design most of which were implemented over short time frames lyon et al 2019 and lacked subsequent refinement davies et al 2014 however it is acknowledged that the manipulated operation cannot be predicted to function with certainty because ecological responses to flow releases may exhibit time lags and the effect of the experiments may even be opposite to the desired effect and thus the microcosmic mechanism would not be captured thompson et al 2018 coupled with global climate change and the uncertainty of environmental conditions a short term flow experiment with coarse grained ecological metrics does not enable sustained ecological restoration that is long term experiments with continuous adaptive management are required to improve them nevertheless all of these experiments have gathered large amounts of monitoring data and accumulated awareness of how conservation goals respond to reservoir operation along with a better understanding of biological demand reservoir operation experiments that alleviate the decline in fish resources in important river basins await refined strategy design therefore how to design refined strategies for reservoir operation to drive the ecological response of fish species remains an issue the primary objective of this study was to explore the refined operation design with the natural flow characteristics and ecological preference of conservation goals that is incorporating more biological demands into the environmental flow releases we 1 established a methodological framework of refined reservoir operation considering the ecological demand of fish species and the corresponding models and 2 described a case study of tgd gzb cascade reservoirs in china the fmcc species and chinese sturgeon which have been described as flagship species of the yangtze river basin were selected as conservation targets 3 we refined water quantity operation strategies of cascade reservoirs for hydrological process sensitive fish and refined generator operation strategies of reservoirs for habitat hydrodynamic sensitive fish and 4 discussed the application prospects of the proposed methodological framework and adaptive management for ongoing refinement we aimed to provide ideas and references suitable for chinese and other international cascade reservoirs to develop and optimize ecological operation conditions in more flexible and diverse ways 2 methodology 2 1 overview in the long process of natural evolution many fish species have developed reproductive habits that require special current stimulation for example the natural reproduction of black carp mylopharyngodon piceus grass carp ctenopharyngodon idellus silver carp hypophthalmichthys molitrix and bighead carp hypophthalmichthys nobilis requires hydrological stimulation of a continuous flow increase process for days ban et al 2019 chinese sturgeon acipenser sinensis and lake sturgeon acipenser fulvescens require hydrodynamic conditions of spawning grounds to trigger spawning activities bennion and manny 2014 zhang et al 2009 therefore the study of reservoir refined operation considering fish ecological demand was designed in four steps 1 representative fish species were selected to identify the ecological demand of natural spawning including the hydrology or hydrodynamic conditions of the habitat 2 to address the ecological demand of the representative fish species refined ecological operation strategies were designed 3 refined operation models were established to apply the proposed strategies for hydrological process sensitive fish a joint water quantity operation model of cascade reservoirs was established for habitat hydrodynamic sensitive fish under dam river hydrodynamic model coupling the operation conditions of hydroelectric generators was established 4 simulation results were obtained to analyze and propose the optimization strategy of refined operation the framework of the methodology is presented as follows fig 1 this methodology focused on hydropower stations with a certain regulation capacity without distinguishing the development type such as run of river additionally the primary objective of this methodology was prioritizing the riverine conservation goals therefore the trade off between human water needs and ecosystem maintenance was not the major factor of concern 2 2 joint water quantity operation model of cascade reservoirs previous joint operation models of cascade reservoirs were more concerned with the optimal effect of hydropower under common constraints and disregarded the ecological demands of fish in the downstream river which failed to meet the development requirements of eco friendly hydropower in recent years this study proposed a joint water quantity operation model of cascade reservoirs the ecological demands of fish were converted to a time varying objective function to obtain solution sets that satisfied the objective function with different operation strategies and ultimately determined the optimal operation strategy for hydropower generation the objective function of the ecological demand of fish was determined as follows 1 f m a x i 1 n t 1 t δ o i t δ t where δ o i t denotes the time varying objective function of fish ecological demand other common constraints for reservoir operation included the water balance reservoir water level reservoir storage

the reservoir inflow at time step t q t is the reservoir outflow at time step t and the loss due to evaporation is disregarded in the water balance constraint the discharges of the tgd and gzb reservoirs are essentially equal 2 water level constraint 3 z min z t z m a x where z t denotes the reservoir water level at time step t z min and z max are the lower limit and upper limit respectively of the reservoir water level 3 reservoir storage constraint 4 v min v t v max where v t denotes the reservoir storage at time step t v min and v max are the lower limit and upper limit respectively of reservoir storage at time step t 4 discharge capacity constraint 5 q min q t q max where q t denotes the reservoir discharge at time step t q min and q max are the minimum reservoir discharge capacity and maximum reservoir discharge capacity respectively 5 hydropower generation constraint 6 n min n t n max where n t denotes the hydropower generation at time step t n min and n max are the lower limit and upper limit respectively of the power generation capacity of the hydropower station 2 3 under dam river hydrodynamic model coupling operation conditions of hydroelectric generators normal computational fluid dynamic cfd models are only concerned with the total discharge when solving upstream and downstream problems however for hydropower stations outlet facilities include hydroelectric generators spillways sluices etc especially under regular operation conditions nonflood season the operation conditions of hydroelectric generators will significantly change the hydrodynamic conditions of the downstream river reach adjacent to the dam the hydrodynamic model proposed in this study precisely divided the mesh of the upstream boundary according to the generator outlet location during mesh modeling and the boundary conditions were set according to the generator operation mode under different operation strategies the time averaged continuity equation and

river impoundment in june 2003 and a normal water level was reached in october 2010 which became the largest integrated water control project globally subsequently the xiangjiaba and xiluodu hydropower stations upstream from the tgd were built the baihetan and wudongde hydropower stations will soon be put into production thus the world s largest cascade reservoirs will be established in the upper and middle reaches of the yangtze river with the current development pattern of cascade reservoirs in the main stream of the yangtze river the tgd reservoir is the key reservoir in the middle reaches of the yangtze river and the gzb reservoir regulates the tgd reservoir as the last reservoir among cascade reservoirs in the upper and middle reaches of the yangtze river the yangtze river section extending from downstream of the gzb dam to the estuary of the yangtze river remains a naturally connected river many fish spawning grounds exist downstream from the gzb dam i e the river reaches from shilihong to yanzhiba and from xianrenqiao to huyatan contain the largest and most stable fmcc spawning grounds in the main stream of the yangtze river moreover the river reach from shilihong to yanzhiba is the only known chinese sturgeon spawning ground in existence xin and zhong lin 1997 zhang et al 2016 there have been more than 10 ecological operations carried out at the tgd gzb cascades on an annual basis since 2011 which have enhanced the flow pulses during the fmcc spawning period and have effectively stimulated the spawning of the fmcc in the lower reaches of the gzb dam cheng et al 2018 xu et al 2020 zheng 2016 the past decade has seen encouraging effects due to implementing the tgd gzb ecological operation experiments however practical experience has indicated that there is a considerable scope for plan refinement of ecological operation therefore this study selected the tgd gzb cascade reservoirs which are representative cascade reservoirs in the upper and middle reaches of the yangtze river as a study case the study area is located dozens of kilometers downstream from the gzb dam which is most directly and notably affected by tgd ecological operation fig 2 3 2 refined water quantity operation of cascade reservoirs for hydrological process sensitive fish 3 2 1 ecohydrological demand of hydrological process sensitive fish the fmcc species are the most economically important fish species in the yangtze river during the initial operation period of the tgd project the hydrological conditions required for fmcc spawning deteriorated resulting in a fish stock decline in 2009 the fmcc egg abundance reached its lowest level of less than 0 042 billion in the jianli section compared with an egg abundance of 40 3 billion in the 1960 s and the fmcc spawning scale sharply decreased the main spawning season of the fmcc extends from late april to early july when water temperatures rise above 18 c flood peaks with water fluctuations trigger the spawning activity of the fmcc wang et al 2014 clearly the spawning of the fmcc is closely related to the flow and water level rise of the river most spawning activities occur during rising flood events the spawning scale is positively related to the duration of rising floods and the relative growth rate of water discharge bai et al 2014 the previous analysis of ecohydrological demand during the fmcc spawning periods before tgd impoundment showed that the flood frequency was 2 to 3 times in may the flood duration was 3 8 days the daily rate of flow increase was 910 2208 m s and the rate of water level increase was 0 41 0 85 m d the flood frequency was 2 to 4 times in june the daily rate of flow increase was 1355 2931 m s and the rate of water level increase was 0 41 0 74 m d guo et al 2011 3 2 2 operation strategy design more than 10 ecological operations have been carried out to promote fmcc spawning at the tgd since 2011 according to the storage reduction need before the flood season the current ecological operation plan involves the establishment of artificial flood peaks to stimulate downstream carp spawning by continuously increasing the discharge combined with the upstream inflow process of the tgd to ensure safety the obtained statistics of hydrological indicators during 12 ecological operation periods at the tgd from 2011 to 2018 revealed that ecological operation experiments were carried out from may to june every year when the river water temperature was above 18 initial discharge ranged from 6800 15300 m3 s daily flow increase rate ranged from 1170 3140 m3 s d and duration of flow increase ranged from 3 to 8 d in the actual ecological operation process the tgd discharge increased during daytime and reduced during nighttime typically from 23 00 to 07 00 to meet the load peak regulation requirements of the power grid leading to cyclic water level increases and declines there was no guarantee of a continuously rising flood level at an hourly scale however fmcc spawning usually occurs before dawn and the above mentioned nighttime decline may not effectively stimulate natural fmcc spawning to study the composite pattern of cascade reservoirs which comprises a large control reservoir and a corresponding downstream reregulation reservoir with a distinct storage disparity and to fully utilize the coordinate operation of cascade reservoirs to create a continuous process of flow increase that not only closely resembles natural flow patterns on a daily scale but also satisfies the ecohydrological demand of fish on an hourly scale this study designed three refined ecological operation optimization strategies strategy 1 took precedence over the other operation strategies strategy 2 was adopted if strategy 1 did not meet the abovementioned constraints while strategy 3 was employed if the other two strategies failed to reach the goal the designed strategies and constraints are described in greater detail in the following table see table 1 3 2 3 model establishment the implementation of refined ecological operation aimed to control the hourly reservoir discharge and the operation model in section 2 2 was adopted the objective functions were calculated as follows 15 f m a x i 1 n t 1 t δ o i t δ t 16 δ o i t s g n q t 1 gzb q t gzb where f is the objective function of the ecological demand of fish n is the number of sequential days for ecological operation t is the number of calculation time periods and δ o i t denotes the time varying objective function of the ecological demand of the fmcc

level variations in the gzb reservoir 18 δ z d gzb 3 m δ z h gzb 1 m where z min and z max are the upper limit and lower limit of the reservoir water level respectively δ z d tgd is the daily decrease rate of the tgd reservoir water level and δ z d gzb and δ z h gzb are the daily decrease rate and hourly variation in the gzb reservoir water level respectively the water level of the gzb reservoir may fluctuate from 63 to 66 5 m with reregulation operation in regard to the tgd reservoir the maximum daily water level variation is 3 m and the maximum hourly water level variation is 1 m 3 2 4 simulation results according to the measured data in 12 ecological operation experiments conducted at the tgd from 2011 to 2018 the gzb reservoir inflow was input into the model as the inflow boundary and the initial water level of the gzb reservoir was employed as the initial operation condition the designed operation strategies in section 3 2 2 were adopted to simulate the gzb release process at different inflow levels and the flow process corresponding to the maximum hydropower generation and flood control limit was selected from all of the feasible solutions each year fig 3 shows a series of typical ecological operation results on an hourly scale for strategy 1 other results are given in supplementary material which revealed that after refined adjustment except for the test in 2014 the test in 2015 and the second test in 2018 strategy 1 could realize a continuous flow increase process on an hourly scale with regular constraints during the ecological operation period in the remaining experiments which showed that the simulation operation processes were feasible the daily release rate decreased by 0 06 almost no change as shown in fig 3b 1 08 1 change as shown in fig 3a 2 07 2 change fig 3c and 3 05 3 change as shown in fig 3d fig 4 shows the refined ecological operation results for strategy 2 while strategy 1 failed to meet the constraints fig 5 shows the ecological operation optimization results after adopting strategy 3 while the other two strategies failed to reach the optimization goal the hydrological and generation indexes for the different operation strategies are listed in tables 2 3 and 4 the results indicated that the average daily outflow of the gzb reservoir ranged from 3 42 2 47 with the designed strategies and the variation in the outflow change rate was mostly within 3 the cumulative rise in the daily flow during the ecological operation period changed in the same way as the actual process the daily flow increase rate varied from 10 97 to 13 39 compared with the regular process and most of the changes were within 4 the downstream water level rise rate varied from 37 74 to 25 58 and most of the changes fell within 7 while the tgd release discharge remained unchanged for strategy 1 and strategy 2 the total hydropower generation output of the gzb dam improved in most experiments and the output variation ranged from 0 38 5 91 after slight changes were employed to the outflow of the tgd with strategy 3 the total output of the tgd during the ecological operation period showed a small change range of 0 52 0 08 and the total output of the gzb dam decreased within the range of 4 59 2 84 during actual operation the output plan of the cascade can be appropriately increased or decreased according to the real time working conditions and operating conditions especially the gzb output plan 3 3 refined generator operation of reservoirs for habitat hydrodynamic sensitive fish 3 3 1 ecohydrological demand of habitat hydrodynamic sensitive fish chinese sturgeon as a species under first grade national protection exhibited a spawning population of 2176 downstream from the gzb dam after river closure during the gzb project in 1983 and 1984 wang et al 2013 the annual spawning population fell to 363 during 1996 2001 wei et al 2009 with fewer than 100 remaining after 2013 from 1983 to 2003 the annual spawning number of chinese sturgeon reached 1 7 which decreased to 1 1 during 2004 2012 wu et al 2017 natural chinese sturgeon spawning was not observed downstream from the gzb dam between 2013 and 2015 although small scale natural spawning occurred in 2016 this pattern was interrupted again in 2017 chinese sturgeon became increasingly endangered and was upgraded to critically endangered cr status in 2010 by the international union for the conservation of nature iucn the spawning season of chinese sturgeon extends from mid october to december and the appropriate water temperature for spawning ranges from 18 0 to 20 0 c guo et al 2011 li et al 2013 yang et al 2007 before the gzb dam s construction the spawning grounds were historically distributed in the pingshan and yibin sections in the upper reaches of the yangtze river after river closure due to the gzb project a new chinese sturgeon spawning ground was formed under the gzb dam and the river reach from the gzb dam to shilihong is the only known chinese sturgeon spawning ground in existence previous studies revealed that the spawning activity of chinese sturgeon was restricted by the local hydrodynamic conditions of the spawning ground hui et al 2012 yu et al 2008 the flow of this spawning ground ranges from 7000 16000 m3 s during spawning periods according to gzb dam chinese sturgeon spawning ground monitoring data acquired during 51 spawning periods from 1988 to 2010 the preferred hydrodynamic conditions for chinese sturgeon spawning include a flow velocity ranging from 0 73 to 2 13 m s and a water depth ranging from 5 93 to 21 29 m luo 2013 which were considered the hydrodynamic demands of chinese sturgeon spawning in this study 3 3 2 operation strategy design the distribution of chinese sturgeon was mainly influenced by the flow pattern and water depth qiao 2006 during the spawning season the preferred velocity and water depth ranges of the chinese sturgeon spawning ground comprise its suitable spawning space this study designed a series of operation strategies to investigate the influences of the various generator operation conditions of the gzb dajiang and erjiang hydropower plants on the improvement of the hydrodynamic conditions of spawning grounds in the downstream river flow condition scenarios according to statistics the suitable flow range of chinese sturgeon is from 7000 16000 m3 s during its spawning periods luo 2013 therefore three flow condition scenarios were designed to represent the lowest 7000 m3 s moderate 10000 m3 s and highest 15000 m3 s outflow discharges among the daily data of chinese sturgeon historical spawning records three spawning days of october 17 2004 15100 m3 s december 12 2004 10150 m3 s and december 9 2006 7090 m3 s were chosen as base boundary conditions for the numerical model the actual outflow of the gzb reservoir matched the set outflow for the different scenarios and corresponded to the downstream water level at the yichang hydrological station operation condition strategies according to the operating procedure of the gzb hydropower station the dajiang power plant with 14 generators provides a total installed capacity of 1750 mw and the maximum discharge capacity is 11928 m3 s with 7 generators the erjiang power plant provides a total installed capacity of 965 mw and the maximum discharge capacity is 6385 m3 s three typical refined operation strategies were established under the first operation condition the average output of the dajiang and erjiang generators was maintained the flow ratio of the dajiang and erjiang generators was 1 81 based on the proportion of the total installed capacity under the second operation condition the dajiang generator output was prioritized the flow was preferentially discharged by the dajiang generators and the remaining flow was discharged by the erjiang generators if needed under the last operation condition the erjiang generator output was prioritized the flow was preferentially discharged by the erjiang generators and the remaining flow was discharged by the dajiang generators if needed the flow distribution parameters of the specific condition combinations are listed in table 5 3 3 3 model establishment based on the underwater channel topography measured in 2003 by the three gorges bureau of hydrology this study generalized the corresponding hydraulic structure boundaries including the erjiang sluice scouring sluice dajiang navigation lock diversion dike and generator outlet a 3d hydrodynamic model of the downstream river section of the gzb reservoir was established and the river reach containing the spawning ground of chinese sturgeon downstream from the gzb dam approximately 6 km river reach from the gzb dam to shilihong was chosen as the simulation area as shown in fig 6 the model adopted a structural hexahedral mesh the average size of the planar mesh is 20 m the vertical mesh was locally refined near the water air interface to obtain a minimum size of 0 1 m and the total number of meshes was 455120 the boundary conditions of the numerical model were established according to the actual inflow conditions during previous chinese sturgeon spawning periods and water level monitoring data obtained at the downstream yichang hydrological station the chinese sturgeon spawning season coincided with the dry season and all the upstream inflows passed through the generators the dajiang navigation lock and sanjiang were intermittently opened to allow ship passage and the outflow of the lock reached approximately 20 50 m3 s compared to a discharge ranging from 7000 16000 m3 s observed during the chinese sturgeon spawning period luo 2013 the outflow of the lock can be disregarded the upstream boundary was established as the power station inlet of gzb and the gzb power station had 21 generators fourteen generators were installed in dajiang and 7 generators were installed in erjiang the inflow was distributed between the dajiang generator and erjiang generator according to the different strategies based on the actual flow conditions and the dajiang navigation lock and sanjiang were defined as zero flow inlet boundaries the downstream boundary was set as the water level boundary and the remaining boundaries were defined as wall boundaries including the erjiang sluice scouring sluice diversion dike and riverbed 3 3 4 simulation results 1 influence on the spawning flow field with different operation condition strategies as a bottom dwelling fish species the bottom flow field characteristics of chinese sturgeon spawning grounds impose an obvious influence on the resultant spawning activities the simulation results of the bottom flow field 0 8 times the water depth in the chinese sturgeon spawning grounds under the different operation condition strategies at the flow level of 15100 m3 s are shown in fig 7 other results under different flow conditions are given in supplementary material the largest area was in a suitable bottom velocity range of 0 73 2 13 m s using the strategy involving the maintenance of the average dajiang and erjiang generator output for the strategy prioritizing the dajiang generator output the yielded area with a bottom flow velocity suitable for chinese sturgeon spawning was slightly smaller compared with the strategy based on the average dajiang and erjiang generator output the most disadvantaged strategy was the strategy prioritizing the erjiang generator output under lower flow conditions with an evident disparity in the split flow ratio between the dajiang generator and the erjiang generator in which the outflow of the erjiang generators at a lower discharge capacity was 9 times that of the dajiang generators as a result most of the flow field formed by the confluence of dajiang and erjiang was unsuitable for chinese sturgeon spawning similarly the other flow condition scenarios showed a consistent influence with only quantity variance 2 influence on water depth in the spawning ground under different flow conditions most of the chinese sturgeon preferred to distribute themselves in spawning grounds with a water depth ranging from 5 93 to 21 29 m the results showed that different operation strategies achieved roughly similar water depth spaces under the same flow conditions given the suitability degree of the bottom flow field for the operation strategies fig 8 only shows the water depth in the spawning ground for the strategy of maintaining average dajiang and erjiang generator output levels under different flow conditions other results for different operation strategies are given in supplementary material under the high flow condition of 15100 m3 s the deepest water depth of the area was 38 57 m between the upper and lower spawning grounds while the entire spawning ground area was within the suitable water depth range in the case of medium and lower flow conditions of 10150 m3 s and 7090 m3 s respectively the water depth greatly decreased in the spawning ground where shoals surrounding the spawning ground rose at the core of the river and shallow waters on the left bank and right bank expanded simultaneously tailwater downstream from the power plants yielded large areas that exceeded the suitable range of water depth 3 integrated suitable space for spawning grounds research shows that in the spawning ground downstream from the gzb dam the suitable flow for the chinese sturgeon spawning period was 0 73 2 13 m s and the suitable water depth was 5 93 21 29 m luo 2013 accordingly this study calculated the suitable space for flow velocity water depth and their integration simultaneously satisfying the suitable range of flow velocity and water depth using calculus the integrated suitable space distribution in the chinese sturgeon spawning grounds for the different operation strategies under a flow of 15100 m3 s is shown in fig 9 other results under different flow conditions are given in supplementary material the statistical data are summarized in table 6 in the upper spawning ground the suitable space area varied with flow levels almost all the areas in the first three scenarios were suitable under the high flow of 15100 m3 s while operation effects occurred in different varieties when the flow was medium and low as the flow decreased to 10150 m3 s the spawning ground remained suitable in scenarios 4 and 5 yet almost the entire area exceeded the suitable range in scenario 6 suitable areas of the spawning ground sharply decreased when the flow q 7090 m3 s approximately half of the area went beyond the suitable range in scenarios 7 and 8 while all parts of the area fell out of the suitable range in scenario 9 the three operation strategies manifested nearly the same variation trend in the lower spawning grounds where all the areas were in the suitable range of flow velocity and water depth under flows of 15100 m3 s and 10150 m3 s and approximately a quarter of the area exceeded the suitable range under a flow of 7090 m3 s 4 discussion 4 1 refined strategy optimization for hydrological process sensitive fish the simulation results presented in section 3 2 4 indicated that a notable effect could be obtained through hourly refined operation of the gzb reservoir despite its very low storage capacity among most of the ecological operation experiments executed the gzb reservoir effectively shifted the flood peak on an hourly scale strategy 1 fig 3 or a constant outflow was maintained at night with flood peak shifting during daytime strategy 2 fig 4 to create a continuous flow increase process without altering the original outflow discharge of the tgd reservoir notably in most ecological operation experiments the variation in the ecohydrological fmcc did not exceed 15 and hydropower generation increased in may and june after refined optimization adjustment which yielded favorable results only a few ecological operation experiments with a duration longer than 8 days established a continuous flow increase process on an hourly scale over several days due to peak regulation of the tgd reservoir during the nighttime load valley period slight changes in the joint outflow of the tgd and gzb reservoirs were needed with the constraint of maintaining the daily water level decline to less than 0 6 m and the peak regulation capacity below 3 million kw strategy 3 fig 5 although some hydropower generation loss occurred during the operation of the tgd gzb cascade reservoirs a continuous hourly flow increase process was sustained over more than 8 days based on the implemented changes overall for the current operation strategy of the tgd gzb cascade reservoirs during the ecological operation period the expected effect of a continuous hourly flow increase downstream from the gzb reservoir could be achieved in most cases via only the hourly refined operation of the gzb reservoir strategies 1 and 2 in which the hydropower generation output was improved to a certain extent thus achieving mutually beneficial progress in ecology and economics hence it is suggested that this strategy could be implemented in the gzb reservoir to further optimize ecological operations in the future 4 2 refined strategy optimization for habitat hydrodynamic sensitive fish the volume variation trend of the suitable space in the chinese sturgeon spawning grounds for the refined operation strategies is shown in fig 10 at the same outflow discharge level the strategy based on the average dajiang and erjiang generator output obtained the largest area of the integrated suitable space when the outflow of the gzb reservoir was high q 15100 m3 s the refined operation conditions of the generators imposed a minimal influence on the integrated suitable space of the chinese sturgeon spawning grounds conversely when the outflow of the gzb reservoir was moderate q 10150 m3 s or low q 7090 m3 s a notable influence on the integrated suitable space of the chinese sturgeon spawning grounds was observed under the various generator operation conditions the best strategy considering chinese sturgeon spawning was the strategy based on the average dajiang and erjiang generator output followed by the strategies prioritizing the dajiang generator output and those prioritizing the erjiang generator output therefore the proposed optimization strategy of gzb ecological operation should focus on the average dajiang and erjiang generator output during the chinese sturgeon spawning period at a high outflow level 15000 m3 s in general the flow field environment of fish species sensitive to local hydrodynamic conditions could be optimized by adjusting the generator operation conditions through a combination of continuous discharge release satisfying the requirements of target fish species with the upstream control reservoir based on adjustment of the reregulation reservoir operation conditions over the last cascade the downstream flow field environment could be further improved 4 3 application prospects in regard to fish the ideal reservoir ecological operation conditions involve the establishment of near natural ecological conditions that satisfy the key spawning demands baumgartner et al 2014 as mentioned above a continuous flow increase process over several days is required during the fmcc spawning period and specific flow velocity and water depth conditions are needed for the chinese sturgeon however under current ecological operation conditions subject to reservoir operations such as load peak regulation of the hydropower stations in conjunction with the electrical power grid system moog 1993 operation adjustment of the different hydropower generators and the limits of the reservoir capacity operating water level discharge capacity and other rigid constraints it is difficult to meet the ecohydrological demands of fish by relying on the single operation of a control reservoir during the whole ecological operation period opperman et al 2019 to improve the comprehensive benefit of the control reservoir in cascade reservoir development a small reregulation reservoir is often built downstream of the control reservoir richter and thomas 2007 generally the reregulation reservoir is a run of river hydropower station with a small storage capacity that does not perform load peak regulation of the power grid pearsall et al 2005 the station mainly regulates the unstable flow released from the upstream control reservoir and takes load peak regulation measures of the electrical network through reregulation to improve the flow conditions of the downstream river typical control and reregulation cascade reservoirs in china are represented by tgd gzb on the yangtze river in the usa the folsom nimbus dam on the american river in california titus et al 2003 and the fort randall dam gavins point dam on the missouri river in nebraska hay et al 2008 are examples of such reservoirs the joint operation of cascade reservoirs can be adopted to create the corresponding hydrological conditions that satisfy the ecohydrological demands of fish during the spawning period such as creating a continuous flow increase process on an hourly scale and slowing the sudden rise and sharp drop in river water level refined ecological operation of cascade reservoirs enhances the reservoir comprehensive effect by coordinating the contradictory relationship between ecological goals and nonecological goals by reducing the risk of water abandonment in the reregulation reservoir during the peak time of the power grid and by guaranteeing the power generation benefits of the reregulation reservoir during the ecological operation period the joint operation of cascade reservoirs can overcome some constraints by leveraging the reregulation capacity between two cascade reservoirs thus incorporating spawning demands in environmental flow design many fish physiological activities are susceptible to hydrodynamic alterations such as the propagation of sexually mature fish migration of larvae and fattening of young fish deng et al 2019a altered local hydrodynamic conditions in spawning grounds affect the reproductive success and population of chinese sturgeon jiao et al 2019 the basic flow velocity that triggers fish migration weakens due to reservoir impoundment leading to fish being unable to detect the correct migration direction xu et al 2017 total dissolved gas tdg supersaturation that occurs in the tailrace causes gas bubble disease and mortality in anadromous fish politano et al 2017 to compensate for these problems arising from hydrodynamic alterations the refined operation of reservoir outlet facilities could be a useful approach to improve the habitat and spawning ground conditions of fish and this approach designs an environmental flow that contains the habitat space preference to match the driving hydrodynamic conditions stimulating fish spawning 4 4 adaptive management recent studies have shown that with the reservoir outflow operating close to the natural regime it may fail to achieve the full benefit of conservation goals as the natural flow regime has drastically shifted chen and olden 2017 horne et al 2017a poff et al 2017 from the perspective of elasticity theory the elasticity of ecosystems depends not only on historical traits but also on the current state daw et al 2016 the emphasis of system recovery is on constantly updating and adapting to achieve dynamic equilibrium with an external disturbance that is stressing the intrinsic resilience of system function recovery poff 2018 hence it is more realistic to set ecological objectives that are not strictly natural to design refined strategies with a deeper understanding of the linkages between the manipulated flow regime and biological responses bestgen et al 2020 specifically the refined design of the ecological operation release of reservoirs should integrate the key ecological demands into a continuum indicator in the case of ecological operation experiments it is clearly a location specific problem horne et al 2017b so the design of environmental flow calls for multiple interactive effects beyond the simple correlations between flow variables and biological responses for example during the ecological operation process because of the particularity of local hydrodynamic conditions in spawning grounds the spawning behavior of the fmcc would not be stimulated by the flow increase in all river reaches in this case designing a flow that integrates hydrological conditions and hydrodynamic conditions as a new targeting flow regime can be an appropriate approach to match the biological response in which both factors would be complementary components gosselin et al 2019 a key limitation that hinders the implementation of ecological operation experiments is the conflict between ecosystem functions and societal values due to the uncertainty of incoming water discharge biological response and electricity demand it is a typical uncertain problem to restore the adverse ecological effects of reservoirs on fish via refined ecological operation and the way to pursue the ecological benefit on par with the other benefits of cascade ecological operation on the aspect of specific operation needs to be further improved and optimized with adaptive management webb et al 2018 in practice the water temperature substrate water quality and other ecological factors should be tracked and monitored to analyze the preference threshold of key ecological factors thus parsing metrics to capture the long term regime of the current regulated hydrological process to explore and summarize effective refined operation strategies to stimulate fish spawning 5 conclusion this study focuses on the design of refined reservoir operation strategies we proposed a methodology of refined reservoir operation considering the ecological demand of fish species and it built a joint water quantity operation model of cascade reservoirs with flexible ecological constraints and an under dam river hydrodynamic model coupling the operation conditions of hydroelectric generators the optimized refined strategies of ecological operation can be summarized as follows 1 it is feasible to combine joint water quantity operation strategies to realize a continuous and smooth flow increase process on an hourly scale in the downstream river reach during the whole ecological operation period based on the very low regulation capacity of the gzb reservoir 2 maintaining the average dajiang and erjiang generator output at a high outflow level of 15000 m3 s during the chinese sturgeon spawning period could more effectively increase the integrated suitable space in downstream chinese sturgeon spawning grounds our study shows that designing a refined operation strategy incorporating more biological demands into environmental flow releases could be a viable way to meet conservation goals thereby providing a reference for the future improvement of reservoir ecological operation related monitoring and effect evaluation work

3589,reservoir ecological operation creates artificial hydrological and hydrodynamic conditions to meet the demand of fish during key life periods which provides eco environmental protection to alleviate the negative impact of hydropower development on ecosystems however based on practical ecological operation experience the flow experiments were rough in terms of plan design most of which were implemented over short time frames and circumstances where downstream flow conditions existed were inconsistent with fish requirements during periods affected by different local reservoir operation conditions this finding suggests that current ecological operations leave considerable space for strategy refinement this study proposed a methodology for designing refined operation strategies incorporating more ecological demands into reservoir operation releases to create and improve suitable ecological conditions for the spawning of representative fish species a joint water quantity operation model of cascade reservoirs and an under dam river hydrodynamic model coupling the operation conditions of hydroelectric generators was built the proposed methodology was applied to the three gorges dam tgd and gezhouba gzb dam cascade reservoirs in china the simulation results indicated that 1 in most cases the target of continuous flow increase on an hourly scale could be simply accomplished via hourly joint water quantity operation of tgd gzb cascade reservoirs 2 maintenance of the average dajiang and erjiang generator output during the spawning period of chinese sturgeon at a high outflow of 15000 m3 s could more effectively expand the integrated suitable space of chinese sturgeon we aimed to provide suggestions and references suitable for cascade reservoirs

opperman et al 2018 since the 1970s western countries have focused on the notable ecological and environmental issues caused by hydropower stations and have carried out research and implemented large scale flow experiments downstream of dams konrad et al 2011 olden et al 2014 owusu et al 2021 thompson et al 2018 for example the hume reservoir in the murray river australia restored certain small to medium level floods that increased the timing of peaks and duration of floods to trigger the spawning and recruitment of native golden and silver perch from mid october until mid december 2005 king et al 2010 rice 2013 at the glen canyon dam on the colorado river usa high flow experiments were conducted to recover the endangered humpback chub gila cypha and maintain populations of other native fish in 1996 2004 2008 and 2012 melis 2011 melis et al 2015 yao and rutschmann 2015 on the durance river in france experimental clear water was released to restore benthic habitat conditions prior to spawning periods of trout at four out of eight dams during 2014 2019 bêche et al 2015 loire et al 2019 following the study of the eco environment effect of hydropower projects chinese studies have emphasized and implemented reservoir ecological operation research since the 21st century zhang et al 2000 adopted the factor criteria system reconstruction analysis method to analyze the ecological hydrologic factors associated with the spawning of the four major chinese carps fmcc wang et al 2014 used genetic programming to identify important environmental factors including flow increase duration and flow increase rate that influence fmcc spawning and larval abundance yi et al 2010 stated that varying daily discharge increase levels were required to achieve different initial discharge levels during the reproductive season of carp species ban et al 2018 showed that optimizing the power discharge allocation of the gezhouba gzb dam could improve the hydrodynamic conditions for spawning chinese sturgeon acipenser sinensis since the suitable local hydrodynamic conditions of the spawning habitat require a high flow pulse yang et al 2021 used a hierarchical model incorporating the flow thermal parameters water quality and their complex interaction effects in six hydropower stations on the middle reach of the yangtze river suggesting that water releases should be performed in a timely manner during fish gonadal development wang et al 2021 proposed reservoir outflow variations across different time scales ovdts as a novel indicator to optimize reservoir operating rule curves considering the full life cycles of fish in the danjiangkou reservoir considering these executed large scale flow experiments we found that these experiments for dam reoperation were rough in terms of plan design most of which were implemented over short time frames lyon et al 2019 and lacked subsequent refinement davies et al 2014 however it is acknowledged that the manipulated operation cannot be predicted to function with certainty because ecological responses to flow releases may exhibit time lags and the effect of the experiments may even be opposite to the desired effect and thus the microcosmic mechanism would not be captured thompson et al 2018 coupled with global climate change and the uncertainty of environmental conditions a short term flow experiment with coarse grained ecological metrics does not enable sustained ecological restoration that is long term experiments with continuous adaptive management are required to improve them nevertheless all of these experiments have gathered large amounts of monitoring data and accumulated awareness of how conservation goals respond to reservoir operation along with a better understanding of biological demand reservoir operation experiments that alleviate the decline in fish resources in important river basins await refined strategy design therefore how to design refined strategies for reservoir operation to drive the ecological response of fish species remains an issue the primary objective of this study was to explore the refined operation design with the natural flow characteristics and ecological preference of conservation goals that is incorporating more biological demands into the environmental flow releases we 1 established a methodological framework of refined reservoir operation considering the ecological demand of fish species and the corresponding models and 2 described a case study of tgd gzb cascade reservoirs in china the fmcc species and chinese sturgeon which have been described as flagship species of the yangtze river basin were selected as conservation targets 3 we refined water quantity operation strategies of cascade reservoirs for hydrological process sensitive fish and refined generator operation strategies of reservoirs for habitat hydrodynamic sensitive fish and 4 discussed the application prospects of the proposed methodological framework and adaptive management for ongoing refinement we aimed to provide ideas and references suitable for chinese and other international cascade reservoirs to develop and optimize ecological operation conditions in more flexible and diverse ways 2 methodology 2 1 overview in the long process of natural evolution many fish species have developed reproductive habits that require special current stimulation for example the natural reproduction of black carp mylopharyngodon piceus grass carp ctenopharyngodon idellus silver carp hypophthalmichthys molitrix and bighead carp hypophthalmichthys nobilis requires hydrological stimulation of a continuous flow increase process for days ban et al 2019 chinese sturgeon acipenser sinensis and lake sturgeon acipenser fulvescens require hydrodynamic conditions of spawning grounds to trigger spawning activities bennion and manny 2014 zhang et al 2009 therefore the study of reservoir refined operation considering fish ecological demand was designed in four steps 1 representative fish species were selected to identify the ecological demand of natural spawning including the hydrology or hydrodynamic conditions of the habitat 2 to address the ecological demand of the representative fish species refined ecological operation strategies were designed 3 refined operation models were established to apply the proposed strategies for hydrological process sensitive fish a joint water quantity operation model of cascade reservoirs was established for habitat hydrodynamic sensitive fish under dam river hydrodynamic model coupling the operation conditions of hydroelectric generators was established 4 simulation results were obtained to analyze and propose the optimization strategy of refined operation the framework of the methodology is presented as follows fig 1 this methodology focused on hydropower stations with a certain regulation capacity without distinguishing the development type such as run of river additionally the primary objective of this methodology was prioritizing the riverine conservation goals therefore the trade off between human water needs and ecosystem maintenance was not the major factor of concern 2 2 joint water quantity operation model of cascade reservoirs previous joint operation models of cascade reservoirs were more concerned with the optimal effect of hydropower under common constraints and disregarded the ecological demands of fish in the downstream river which failed to meet the development requirements of eco friendly hydropower in recent years this study proposed a joint water quantity operation model of cascade reservoirs the ecological demands of fish were converted to a time varying objective function to obtain solution sets that satisfied the objective function with different operation strategies and ultimately determined the optimal operation strategy for hydropower generation the objective function of the ecological demand of fish was determined as follows 1 f m a x i 1 n t 1 t δ o i t δ t where δ o i t denotes the time varying objective function of fish ecological demand other common constraints for reservoir operation included the water balance reservoir water level reservoir storage

the reservoir inflow at time step t q t is the reservoir outflow at time step t and the loss due to evaporation is disregarded in the water balance constraint the discharges of the tgd and gzb reservoirs are essentially equal 2 water level constraint 3 z min z t z m a x where z t denotes the reservoir water level at time step t z min and z max are the lower limit and upper limit

discharge capacity and maximum reservoir discharge capacity respectively 5 hydropower generation constraint 6 n min n t n max where n t denotes the hydropower generation at time step t n min and n max are the lower limit and upper limit respectively of the power generation capacity of the hydropower station 2 3 under dam river hydrodynamic model coupling operation conditions of hydroelectric generators normal computational fluid dynamic cfd models are only concerned with the total discharge when solving upstream and downstream problems however for hydropower stations outlet facilities include hydroelectric generators spillways sluices etc especially under regular operation conditions nonflood season the operation conditions of hydroelectric generators will significantly change the hydrodynamic conditions of the downstream river reach adjacent to the dam the hydrodynamic model proposed in this study precisely divided the mesh of the upstream boundary according to the generator outlet location during mesh modeling and the boundary conditions were set according to the generator operation mode under different operation strategies the time averaged continuity equation and navier stokes equation reynolds averaged navier stokes rans equation were considered governing equations continuity equation 7 u i x i 0 momentum equation 8 ρ u i t u j u i x j p x i x j μ u i x j ρ u

longest river worldwide the yangtze river originates in the tanggula mountains on the qinghai tibet plateau and flows through the three gradient terrains of the chinese mainland the yangtze basin exhibits a complex topography well developed river networks and river systems a varied climate and abundant fish resources it is estimated that 378 fish species exist across the yangtze basin ranking as the largest population among all chinese water systems 162 of which are endemic species to the yangtze basin including 11 migratory marine fish species and 7 nationally protected fish species chen et al 2009 park et al 2003 ye et al 2011 yu et al 2005 zhang et al 2020 the yangtze basin is an important area and major germplasm bank of chinese freshwater fisheries which account for more than 60 of the total freshwater fish production guo and li 2003 sifa 1998 the gzb project is the first large scale hydropower project in the mainstream of the yangtze river river closure was completed in january 1981 and impoundment was initiated in may 1981 electricity generation commenced in december 1988 representing a milestone in the chinese hydropower generation history during the 20th century the gzb dam divided the yangtze river into three parts dajiang erjiang and sanjiang the dam consists of two hydropower plants located in dajiang and erjiang where dajiang on the right bank is the main stream entering the 21st century the development of cascade hydroelectric power in the main stream of the yangtze river accelerated the tgd located 38 km upstream from the gzb project began staged river impoundment in june 2003 and a normal water level was reached in october 2010 which became the largest integrated water control project globally subsequently the xiangjiaba and xiluodu hydropower stations upstream from the tgd were built the baihetan and wudongde hydropower stations will soon be put into production thus the world s largest cascade reservoirs will be established in the upper and middle reaches of the yangtze river with the current development pattern of cascade reservoirs in the main stream of the yangtze river the tgd reservoir is the key reservoir in the middle reaches of the yangtze river and the gzb reservoir regulates the tgd reservoir as the last reservoir among cascade reservoirs in the upper and middle reaches of the yangtze river the yangtze river section extending from downstream of the gzb dam to the estuary of the yangtze river remains a naturally connected river many fish spawning grounds exist downstream from the gzb dam i e the river reaches from shilihong to yanzhiba and from xianrenqiao to huyatan contain the largest and most stable fmcc spawning grounds in the main stream of the yangtze river moreover the river reach from shilihong to yanzhiba is the only known chinese sturgeon spawning ground in existence xin and zhong lin 1997 zhang et al 2016 there have been more than 10 ecological operations carried out at the tgd gzb cascades on an annual basis since 2011 which have enhanced the flow pulses during the fmcc spawning period and have effectively stimulated the spawning of the fmcc in the lower reaches of the gzb dam cheng et al 2018 xu et al 2020 zheng 2016 the past decade has seen encouraging effects due to implementing the tgd gzb ecological operation experiments however practical experience has indicated that there is a considerable scope for plan refinement of ecological operation therefore this study selected the tgd gzb cascade reservoirs which are representative cascade reservoirs in the upper and middle reaches of the yangtze river as a study case the study area is located dozens of kilometers downstream from the gzb dam which is most directly and notably affected by tgd ecological operation fig 2 3 2 refined water quantity operation of cascade reservoirs for hydrological process sensitive fish 3 2 1 ecohydrological demand of hydrological process sensitive fish the fmcc species are the most economically important fish species in the yangtze river during the initial operation period of the tgd project the hydrological conditions required for fmcc spawning deteriorated resulting in a fish stock decline in 2009 the fmcc egg abundance reached its lowest level of less than 0 042 billion in the jianli section compared with an egg abundance of 40 3 billion in the 1960 s and the fmcc spawning scale sharply decreased the main spawning season of the fmcc extends from late april to early july when water temperatures rise above 18 c flood peaks with water fluctuations trigger the spawning activity of the fmcc wang et al 2014 clearly the spawning of the fmcc is closely related to the flow and water level rise of the river most spawning activities occur during rising flood events the spawning scale is positively related to the duration of rising floods and the relative growth rate of water discharge bai et al 2014 the previous analysis of ecohydrological demand during the fmcc spawning periods before tgd impoundment showed that the flood frequency was 2 to 3 times in may the flood duration was 3 8 days the daily rate of flow increase was 910 2208 m s and the rate of water level increase was 0 41 0 85 m d the flood frequency was 2 to 4 times in june the daily rate of flow increase was 1355 2931 m s and the rate of water level increase was 0 41 0 74 m d guo et al 2011 3 2 2 operation strategy design more than 10 ecological operations have been carried out to promote fmcc spawning at the tgd since 2011 according to the storage reduction need before the flood season the current ecological operation plan involves the establishment of artificial flood peaks to stimulate downstream carp spawning by continuously increasing the discharge combined with the upstream inflow process of the tgd to ensure safety the obtained statistics of hydrological indicators during 12 ecological operation periods at the tgd from 2011 to 2018 revealed that ecological operation experiments were carried out from may to june every year when the river water temperature was above 18 initial discharge ranged from 6800 15300 m3 s daily flow increase rate ranged from 1170 3140 m3 s d and duration of flow increase ranged from 3 to 8 d in the actual ecological operation process the tgd discharge increased during daytime and reduced during nighttime typically from 23 00 to 07 00 to meet the load peak regulation requirements of the power grid leading to cyclic water level increases and declines there was no guarantee of a continuously rising flood level at an hourly scale however fmcc spawning usually occurs before dawn and the above mentioned nighttime decline may not effectively stimulate natural fmcc spawning to study the composite pattern of cascade reservoirs which comprises a large control reservoir and a corresponding downstream reregulation reservoir with a distinct storage disparity and to fully utilize the coordinate operation of cascade reservoirs to create a continuous process of flow increase that not only closely resembles natural flow patterns on a daily scale but also satisfies the ecohydrological demand of fish on an hourly scale this study designed three refined ecological operation optimization strategies strategy 1 took precedence over the other operation strategies strategy 2 was adopted if strategy 1 did not meet the abovementioned constraints while strategy 3 was employed if the other two strategies failed to reach the goal the designed strategies and constraints are described in greater detail in the following table see table 1 3 2 3 model establishment the implementation of refined ecological operation aimed to control the hourly reservoir discharge and the operation model in section 2 2 was adopted the objective functions were calculated as follows 15 f m a x i 1 n t 1 t δ o i t δ t 16 δ o i t s g n q t 1 gzb q t gzb where f is the objective function of the ecological demand of fish n is the number of sequential days for ecological operation t is the number of calculation time periods and δ o i t denotes the time varying objective function of the ecological demand of the fmcc referring to the outflow fluctuation of the gzb reservoir at time t 1 compared with time t on day i q t 1 gzb and q t gzb denote the gzb reservoir discharge at time step t 1 and time step t respectively sgn is the step function q t 1 gzb q t gzb 0 s g n q t 1 gzb q t gzb 1 q t 1 gzb q t gzb 0 s g n q t 1 gzb q t gzb 0 q t 1 gzb q t gzb 0 s g n q t 1 gzb q t gzb 1 and δ t is the calculation time step of the gzb reservoir inflow and outflow processes based on the guidelines contained in the three gorges normal operation period gezhouba water control cascade operation regulation the operation constraints of the gzb reservoir contained the following variables reservoir water level daily decrease rate of the tgd 17 δ z d tgd 0 6 m daily and hourly reservoir water level variations in the gzb reservoir 18 δ z d gzb 3 m δ z h gzb 1 m where z min and z max are the upper limit and lower limit of the reservoir water level respectively δ z d tgd is the daily decrease rate of the tgd reservoir water level and δ z d gzb and δ z h gzb are the daily decrease rate and hourly variation in the gzb reservoir water level respectively the water level of the gzb reservoir may fluctuate from 63 to 66 5 m with reregulation operation in regard to the tgd reservoir the maximum daily water level variation is 3 m and the maximum hourly water level variation is 1 m 3 2 4 simulation results according to the measured data in 12 ecological operation experiments conducted at the tgd from 2011 to 2018 the gzb reservoir inflow was input into the model as the inflow boundary and the initial water level of the gzb reservoir was employed as the initial operation condition the designed operation strategies in section 3 2 2 were adopted to simulate the gzb release process at different inflow levels and the flow process corresponding to the maximum hydropower generation and flood control limit was selected from all of the feasible solutions each year fig 3 shows a series of typical ecological operation results on an hourly scale for strategy 1 other results are given in supplementary material which revealed that after refined adjustment except for the test in 2014 the test in 2015 and the second test in 2018 strategy 1 could realize a continuous flow increase process on an hourly scale with regular constraints during the ecological operation period in the remaining experiments which showed that the simulation operation processes were feasible the daily release rate decreased by 0 06 almost no change as shown in fig 3b 1 08 1 change as shown in fig 3a 2 07 2 change fig 3c and 3 05 3 change as shown in fig 3d fig 4 shows the refined ecological operation results for strategy 2 while strategy 1 failed to meet the constraints fig 5 shows the ecological operation optimization results after adopting strategy 3 while the other two strategies failed to reach the optimization goal the hydrological and generation indexes for the different operation strategies are listed in tables 2 3 and 4 the results indicated that the average daily outflow of the gzb reservoir ranged from 3 42 2 47 with the designed strategies and the variation in the outflow change rate was mostly within 3 the cumulative rise in the daily flow during the ecological operation period changed in the same way as the actual process the daily flow increase rate varied from 10 97 to 13 39 compared with the regular process and most of the changes were within 4 the downstream water level rise rate varied from 37 74 to 25 58 and most of the changes fell within 7 while the tgd release discharge remained unchanged for strategy 1 and strategy 2 the total hydropower generation output of the gzb dam improved in most experiments and the output variation ranged from 0 38 5 91 after slight changes were employed to the outflow of the tgd with strategy 3 the total output of the tgd during the ecological operation period showed a small change range of 0 52 0 08 and the total output of the gzb dam decreased within the range of 4 59 2 84 during actual operation the output plan of the cascade can be appropriately increased or decreased according to the real time working conditions and operating conditions especially the gzb output plan 3 3 refined generator operation of reservoirs for habitat hydrodynamic sensitive fish 3 3 1 ecohydrological demand of habitat hydrodynamic sensitive fish chinese sturgeon as a species under first grade national protection exhibited a spawning population of 2176 downstream from the gzb dam after river closure during the gzb project in 1983 and 1984 wang et al 2013 the annual spawning population fell to 363 during 1996 2001 wei et al 2009 with fewer than 100 remaining after 2013 from 1983 to 2003 the annual spawning number of chinese sturgeon reached 1 7 which decreased to 1 1 during 2004 2012 wu et al 2017 natural chinese sturgeon spawning was not observed downstream from the gzb dam between 2013 and 2015 although small scale natural spawning occurred in 2016 this pattern was interrupted again in 2017 chinese sturgeon became increasingly endangered and was upgraded to critically endangered cr status in 2010 by the international union for the conservation of nature iucn the spawning season of chinese sturgeon extends from mid october to december and the appropriate water temperature for spawning ranges from 18 0 to 20 0 c guo et al 2011 li et al 2013 yang et al 2007 before the gzb dam s construction the spawning grounds were historically distributed in the pingshan and yibin sections in the upper reaches of the yangtze river after river closure due to the gzb project a new chinese sturgeon spawning ground was formed under the gzb dam and the river reach from the gzb dam to shilihong is the only known chinese sturgeon spawning ground in existence previous studies revealed that the spawning activity of chinese sturgeon was restricted by the local hydrodynamic conditions of the spawning ground hui et al 2012 yu et al 2008 the flow of this spawning ground ranges from 7000 16000 m3 s during spawning periods according to gzb dam chinese sturgeon spawning ground monitoring data acquired during 51 spawning periods from 1988 to 2010 the preferred hydrodynamic conditions for chinese sturgeon spawning include a flow velocity ranging from 0 73 to 2 13 m s and a water depth ranging from 5 93 to 21 29 m luo 2013 which were considered the hydrodynamic demands of chinese sturgeon spawning in this study 3 3 2 operation strategy design the distribution of chinese sturgeon was mainly influenced by the flow pattern and water depth qiao 2006 during the spawning season the preferred velocity and water depth ranges of the chinese sturgeon spawning ground comprise its suitable spawning space this study designed a series of operation strategies to investigate the influences of the various generator operation conditions of the gzb dajiang and erjiang hydropower plants on the improvement of the hydrodynamic conditions of spawning grounds in the downstream river flow condition scenarios according to statistics the suitable flow range of chinese sturgeon is from 7000 16000 m3 s during its spawning periods luo 2013 therefore three flow condition scenarios were designed to represent the lowest 7000 m3 s moderate 10000 m3 s and highest 15000 m3 s outflow discharges among the daily data of chinese sturgeon historical spawning records three spawning days of october 17 2004 15100 m3 s december 12 2004 10150 m3 s and december 9 2006 7090 m3 s were chosen as base boundary conditions for the numerical model the actual outflow of the gzb reservoir matched the set outflow for the different scenarios and corresponded to the downstream water level at the yichang hydrological station operation condition strategies according to the operating procedure of the gzb hydropower station the dajiang power plant with 14 generators provides a total installed capacity of 1750 mw and the maximum discharge capacity is 11928 m3 s with 7 generators the erjiang power plant provides a total installed capacity of 965 mw and the maximum discharge capacity is 6385 m3 s three typical refined operation strategies were established under the first operation condition the average output of the dajiang and erjiang generators was maintained the flow ratio of the dajiang and erjiang generators was 1 81 based on the proportion of the total installed capacity under the second operation condition the dajiang generator output was prioritized the flow was preferentially discharged by the dajiang generators and the remaining flow was discharged by the erjiang generators if needed under the last operation condition the erjiang generator output was prioritized the flow was preferentially discharged by the erjiang generators and the remaining flow was discharged by the dajiang generators if needed the flow distribution parameters of the specific condition combinations are listed in table 5 3 3 3 model establishment based on the underwater channel topography measured in 2003 by the three gorges bureau of hydrology this study generalized the corresponding hydraulic structure boundaries including the erjiang sluice scouring sluice dajiang navigation lock diversion dike and generator outlet a 3d hydrodynamic model of the downstream river section of the gzb reservoir was established and the river reach containing the spawning ground of chinese sturgeon downstream from the gzb dam approximately 6 km river reach from the gzb dam to shilihong was chosen as the simulation area as shown in fig 6 the model adopted a structural hexahedral mesh the average size of the planar mesh is 20 m the vertical mesh was locally refined near the water air interface to obtain a minimum size of 0 1 m and the total number of meshes was 455120 the boundary conditions of the numerical model were established according to the actual inflow conditions during previous chinese sturgeon spawning periods and water level monitoring data obtained at the downstream yichang hydrological station the chinese sturgeon spawning season coincided with the dry season and all the upstream inflows passed through the generators the dajiang navigation lock and sanjiang were intermittently opened to allow ship passage and the outflow of the lock reached approximately 20 50 m3 s compared to a discharge ranging from 7000 16000 m3 s observed during the chinese sturgeon spawning period luo 2013 the outflow of the lock can be disregarded the upstream boundary was established as the power station inlet of gzb and the gzb power station had 21 generators fourteen generators were installed in dajiang and 7 generators were installed in erjiang the inflow was distributed between the dajiang generator and erjiang generator according to the different strategies based on the actual flow conditions and the dajiang navigation lock and sanjiang were defined as zero flow inlet boundaries the downstream boundary was set as the water level boundary and the remaining boundaries were defined as wall boundaries including the erjiang sluice scouring sluice diversion dike and riverbed 3 3 4 simulation results 1 influence on the spawning flow field with different operation condition strategies as a bottom dwelling fish species the bottom flow field characteristics of chinese sturgeon spawning grounds impose an obvious influence on the resultant spawning activities the simulation results of the bottom flow field 0 8 times the water depth in the chinese sturgeon spawning grounds under the different operation condition strategies at the flow level of 15100 m3 s are shown in fig 7 other results under different flow conditions are given in supplementary material the largest area was in a suitable bottom velocity range of 0 73 2 13 m s using the strategy involving the maintenance of the average dajiang and erjiang generator output for the strategy prioritizing the dajiang generator output the yielded area with a bottom flow velocity suitable for chinese sturgeon spawning was slightly smaller compared with the strategy based on the average dajiang and erjiang generator output the most disadvantaged strategy was the strategy prioritizing the erjiang generator output under lower flow conditions with an evident disparity in the split flow ratio between the dajiang generator and the erjiang generator in which the outflow of the erjiang generators at a lower discharge capacity was 9 times that of the dajiang generators as a result most of the flow field formed by the confluence of dajiang and erjiang was unsuitable for chinese sturgeon spawning similarly the other flow condition scenarios showed a consistent influence with only quantity variance 2 influence on water depth in the spawning ground under different flow conditions most of the chinese sturgeon preferred to distribute themselves in spawning grounds with a water depth ranging from 5 93 to 21 29 m the results showed that different operation strategies achieved roughly similar water depth spaces under the same flow conditions given the suitability degree of the bottom flow field for the operation strategies fig 8 only shows the water depth in the spawning ground for the strategy of maintaining average dajiang and erjiang generator output levels under different flow conditions other results for different operation strategies are given in supplementary material under the high flow condition of 15100 m3 s the deepest water depth of the area was 38 57 m between the upper and lower spawning grounds while the entire spawning ground area was within the suitable water depth range in the case of medium and lower flow conditions of 10150 m3 s and 7090 m3 s respectively the water depth greatly decreased in the spawning ground where shoals surrounding the spawning ground rose at the core of the river and shallow waters on the left bank and right bank expanded simultaneously tailwater downstream from the power plants yielded large areas that exceeded the suitable range of water depth 3 integrated suitable space for spawning grounds research shows that in the spawning ground downstream from the gzb dam the suitable flow for the chinese sturgeon spawning period was 0 73 2 13 m s and the suitable water depth was 5 93 21 29 m luo 2013 accordingly this study calculated the suitable space for flow velocity water depth and their integration simultaneously satisfying the suitable range of flow velocity and water depth using calculus the integrated suitable space distribution in the chinese sturgeon spawning grounds for the different operation strategies under a flow of 15100 m3 s is shown in fig 9 other results under different flow conditions are given in supplementary material the statistical data are summarized in table 6 in the upper spawning ground the suitable space area varied with flow levels almost all the areas in the first three scenarios were suitable under the high flow of 15100 m3 s while operation effects occurred in different varieties when the flow was medium and low as the flow decreased to 10150 m3 s the spawning ground remained suitable in scenarios 4 and 5 yet almost the entire area exceeded the suitable range in scenario 6 suitable areas of the spawning ground sharply decreased when the flow q 7090 m3 s approximately half of the area went beyond the suitable range in scenarios 7 and 8 while all parts of the area fell out of the suitable range in scenario 9 the three operation strategies manifested nearly the same variation trend in the lower spawning grounds where all the areas were in the suitable range of flow velocity and water depth under flows of 15100 m3 s and 10150 m3 s and approximately a quarter of the area exceeded the suitable range under a flow of 7090 m3 s 4 discussion 4 1 refined strategy optimization for hydrological process sensitive fish the simulation results presented in section 3 2 4 indicated that a notable effect could be obtained through hourly refined operation of the gzb reservoir despite its very low storage capacity among most of the ecological operation experiments executed the gzb reservoir effectively shifted the flood peak on an hourly scale strategy 1 fig 3 or a constant outflow was maintained at night with flood peak shifting during daytime strategy 2 fig 4 to create a continuous flow increase process without altering the original outflow discharge of the tgd reservoir notably in most ecological operation experiments the variation in the ecohydrological fmcc did not exceed 15 and hydropower generation increased in may and june after refined optimization adjustment which yielded favorable results only a few ecological operation experiments with a duration longer than 8 days established a continuous flow increase process on an hourly scale over several days due to peak regulation of the tgd reservoir during the nighttime load valley period slight changes in the joint outflow of the tgd and gzb reservoirs were needed with the constraint of maintaining the daily water level decline to less than 0 6 m and the peak regulation capacity below 3 million kw strategy 3 fig 5 although some hydropower generation loss occurred during the operation of the tgd gzb cascade reservoirs a continuous hourly flow increase process was sustained over more than 8 days based on the implemented changes overall for the current operation strategy of the tgd gzb cascade reservoirs during the ecological operation period the expected effect of a continuous hourly flow increase downstream from the gzb reservoir could be achieved in most cases via only the hourly refined operation of the gzb reservoir strategies 1 and 2 in which the hydropower generation output was improved to a certain extent thus achieving mutually beneficial progress in ecology and economics hence it is suggested that this strategy could be implemented in the gzb reservoir to further optimize ecological operations in the future 4 2 refined strategy optimization for habitat hydrodynamic sensitive fish the volume variation trend of the suitable space in the chinese sturgeon spawning grounds for the refined operation strategies is shown in fig 10 at the same outflow discharge level the strategy based on the average dajiang and erjiang generator output obtained the largest area of the integrated suitable space when the outflow of the gzb reservoir was high q 15100 m3 s the refined operation conditions of the generators imposed a minimal influence on the integrated suitable space of the chinese sturgeon spawning grounds conversely when the outflow of the gzb reservoir was moderate q 10150 m3 s or low q 7090 m3 s a notable influence on the integrated suitable space of the chinese sturgeon spawning grounds was observed under the various generator operation conditions the best strategy considering chinese sturgeon spawning was the strategy based on the average dajiang and erjiang generator output followed by the strategies prioritizing the dajiang generator output and those prioritizing the erjiang generator output therefore the proposed optimization strategy of gzb ecological operation should focus on the average dajiang and erjiang generator output during the chinese sturgeon spawning period at a high outflow level 15000 m3 s in general the flow field environment of fish species sensitive to local hydrodynamic conditions could be optimized by adjusting the generator operation conditions through a combination of continuous discharge release satisfying the requirements of target fish species with the upstream control reservoir based on adjustment of the reregulation reservoir operation conditions over the last cascade the downstream flow field environment could be further improved 4 3 application prospects in regard to fish the ideal reservoir ecological operation conditions involve the establishment of near natural ecological conditions that satisfy the key spawning demands baumgartner et al 2014 as mentioned above a continuous flow increase process over several days is required during the fmcc spawning period and specific flow velocity and water depth conditions are needed for the chinese sturgeon however under current ecological operation conditions subject to reservoir operations such as load peak regulation of the hydropower stations in conjunction with the electrical power grid system moog 1993 operation adjustment of the different hydropower generators and the limits of the reservoir capacity operating water level discharge capacity and other rigid constraints it is difficult to meet the ecohydrological demands of fish by relying on the single operation of a control reservoir during the whole ecological operation period opperman et al 2019 to improve the comprehensive benefit of the control reservoir in cascade reservoir development a small reregulation reservoir is often built downstream of the control reservoir richter and thomas 2007 generally the reregulation reservoir is a run of river hydropower station with a small storage capacity that does not perform load peak regulation of the power grid pearsall et al 2005 the station mainly regulates the unstable flow released from the upstream control reservoir and takes load peak regulation measures of the electrical network through reregulation to improve the flow conditions of the downstream river typical control and reregulation cascade reservoirs in china are represented by tgd gzb on the yangtze river in the usa the folsom nimbus dam on the american river in california titus et al 2003 and the fort randall dam gavins point dam on the missouri river in nebraska hay et al 2008 are examples of such reservoirs the joint operation of cascade reservoirs can be adopted to create the corresponding hydrological conditions that satisfy the ecohydrological demands of fish during the spawning period such as creating a continuous flow increase process on an hourly scale and slowing the sudden rise and sharp drop in river water level refined ecological operation of cascade reservoirs enhances the reservoir comprehensive effect by coordinating the contradictory relationship between ecological goals and nonecological goals by reducing the risk of water abandonment in the reregulation reservoir during the peak time of the power grid and by guaranteeing the power generation benefits of the reregulation reservoir during the ecological operation period the joint operation of cascade reservoirs can overcome some constraints by leveraging the reregulation capacity between two cascade reservoirs thus incorporating spawning demands in environmental flow design many fish physiological activities are susceptible to hydrodynamic alterations such as the propagation of sexually mature fish migration of larvae and fattening of young fish deng et al 2019a altered local hydrodynamic conditions in spawning grounds affect the reproductive success and population of chinese sturgeon jiao et al 2019 the basic flow velocity that triggers fish migration weakens due to reservoir impoundment leading to fish being unable to detect the correct migration direction xu et al 2017 total dissolved gas tdg supersaturation that occurs in the tailrace causes gas bubble disease and mortality in anadromous fish politano et al 2017 to compensate for these problems arising from hydrodynamic alterations the refined operation of reservoir outlet facilities could be a useful approach to improve the habitat and spawning ground conditions of fish and this approach designs an environmental flow that contains the habitat space preference to match the driving hydrodynamic conditions stimulating fish spawning 4 4 adaptive management recent studies have shown that with the reservoir outflow operating close to the natural regime it may fail to achieve the full benefit of conservation goals as the natural flow regime has drastically shifted chen and olden 2017 horne et al 2017a poff et al 2017 from the perspective of elasticity theory the elasticity of ecosystems depends not only on historical traits but also on the current state daw et al 2016 the emphasis of system recovery is on constantly updating and adapting to achieve dynamic equilibrium with an external disturbance that is stressing the intrinsic resilience of system function recovery poff 2018 hence it is more realistic to set ecological objectives that are not strictly natural to design refined strategies with a deeper understanding of the linkages between the manipulated flow regime and biological responses bestgen et al 2020 specifically the refined design of the ecological operation release of reservoirs should integrate the key ecological demands into a continuum indicator in the case of ecological operation experiments it is clearly a location specific problem horne et al 2017b so the design of environmental flow calls for multiple interactive effects beyond the simple correlations between flow variables and biological responses for example during the ecological operation process because of the particularity of local hydrodynamic conditions in spawning grounds the spawning behavior of the fmcc would not be stimulated by the flow increase in all river reaches in this case designing a flow that integrates hydrological conditions and hydrodynamic conditions as a new targeting flow regime can be an appropriate approach to match the biological response in which both factors would be complementary components gosselin et al 2019 a key limitation that hinders the implementation of ecological operation experiments is the conflict between ecosystem functions and societal values due to the uncertainty of incoming water discharge biological response and electricity demand it is a typical uncertain problem to restore the adverse ecological effects of reservoirs on fish via refined ecological operation and the way to pursue the ecological benefit on par with the other benefits of cascade ecological operation on the aspect of specific operation needs to be further improved and optimized with adaptive management webb et al 2018 in practice the water temperature substrate water quality and other ecological factors should be tracked and monitored to analyze the preference threshold of key ecological factors thus parsing metrics to capture the long term regime of the current regulated hydrological process to explore and summarize effective refined operation strategies to stimulate fish spawning 5 conclusion this study focuses on the design of refined reservoir operation strategies we proposed a methodology of refined reservoir operation considering the ecological demand of fish species and it built a joint water quantity operation model of cascade reservoirs with flexible ecological constraints and an under dam river hydrodynamic model coupling the operation conditions of hydroelectric generators the optimized refined strategies of ecological operation can be summarized as follows 1 it is feasible to combine joint water quantity operation strategies to realize a continuous and smooth flow increase process on an hourly scale in the downstream river reach during the whole ecological operation period based on the very low regulation capacity of the gzb reservoir 2 maintaining the average dajiang and erjiang generator output at a high outflow level of 15000 m3 s during the chinese sturgeon spawning period could more effectively increase the integrated suitable space in downstream chinese sturgeon spawning grounds our study shows that designing a refined operation strategy incorporating more biological demands into environmental flow releases could be a viable way to meet conservation goals thereby providing a reference for the future improvement of reservoir ecological operation related monitoring and effect evaluation work
