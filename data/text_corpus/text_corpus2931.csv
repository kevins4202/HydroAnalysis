14655,the performance of conventional photocatalytic reactors suffers from low photocatalyst mass loading densities affixed to surfaces and light scattering losses or light attenuation in slurry reactors these limitations are overcome by fabrication of high mass loading g c3n4 embedded metamaterial porous structures on flexible polymeric optical fibers g c3n4 pofs in this study the fabricated g c3n4 pofs contain g c3n4 with mass loading 100 1000x higher than previouly reported enabling efficient light delivery to g c3n4 and improved pollutant mass transport within metamaterial porous structures the key fabrication step involved using acetone based on its high saturated vapor pressure and low dielectric constant making roll to roll mass production of high mass loading photocatalyst embedded metamaterial pofs possible at room temperature within seconds using bundles of 150 individual g c3n4 pofs in the reactors we achieved 4x higher degradation rates for micropollutants under visible light irradiation at 420 nm compared with equivalent mass to volume ratios of photocatalysts in a slurry suspension reactor the bundled g c3n4 pof reactor showed no degradation in the structural integrity or loss of pollutant degradation using deionized or model drinking water under accumulated ho exposures of 4 5 10 9 m s after 20 cycles of treatment it operates continuously at g c3n4 dosages equivalent to 100 1000 g l and a water depth over 40 cm making it a feasible alternative to conventional photocatalytic reactors graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords

have enormous potential to address environment pollution or energy challenges through water splitting nakata and fujishima 2012 boyjoo et al 2017 ahmed et al 2018 however the efficiency of most photocatalytic slurry based applications is limited by the need to recover the photocatalysts from water and the light scattering or occlusion by photocatalysts and other aqueous constituents reduce the photonic quantum efficiency de lasa et al 2005 immobilizing photocatalysts on supporting media including the quartz protection tube of uv lamps cho et al 2007 yoo et al 2015 reactor walls dijkstra et al 2001 van grieken et al 2009 nickheslat et al 2013 mesh bestetti et al 2010 wang et al 2018 membranes horovitz et al 2016 plates hakki et al 2019 and sponges su et al 2018 li et al 2020 can eliminate the energy requirements associated with catalyst recovery but does not prevent light scattering or occlusion by aqueous constituents and sometimes even exacerbated by supporting media binjhade et al 2022 for example photocatalysts immobilized in fixed bed film reactors degrading clofibric acid achieved lower quantum yields 44 to 65 compared against those by equivalent photocatalyst loadings in slurry manassero et al 2017 in contrast photocatalyst coated optical fibers show great potential to solve the aforementioned challenges by light attenuation scattering or occlusion because light is delivered from within the fiber to catalysts mounted on the fiber surface which is in contact with water containing pollutants peill et al 1995 danion et al 2007 xu et al 2008 ling et al 2017 tugaoen et al 2018 visan et al 2019 song et al 2021 zhao et al 2021 such a strategy achieved 2x to 5x higher quantum yields than those of equivalent photocatalyst loading in slurry in degrading malic acid danion et al 2007 or methylene blue ling et al 2017 an added benefit of this inside out light delivery by optical fibers is that photocatalyst coated optical fibers can be used in waters with low transmittance such as colored groundwaters turbid surface water activated sludge bioreactors with high biomass levels ni et al 2022 and even colored industrial wastewater most photocatalyst coated optical fiber studies use one or only a few fibers in batch reactors and a key limitation of larger scale investigations has been in creating low cost scalable manufacturing of photocatalyst coated optical fibers capable of using energy efficient light sources quartz optical fibers hereafter denoted as qofs have high uv c transmittance and have been the most widely reported approach to fabricate photocatalyst coated optical fibers peill et al 1995 danion et al 2007 xu et al 2008 ling et al 2017 tugaoen et al 2018 song et al 2021 zhao et al 2021 as light propagates along the qof core photons either refract out from the fiber core modes 1 and 2 in fig 1 a peill et al 1995 danion et al 2007 xu et al 2008 ling et al 2017 tugaoen et al 2018 song et al 2021 zhao et al 2021 or generate evanescent energy waves mode 3 in fig 1a to activate photocatalysts coated on the surface ling et al 2017 song et al 2021 zhao et al 2021 fabrication of metamaterial structures of surface coated photocatalyst layers minimizes refracted light and maximizes evanescent waves generated during total internal reflection to reduce light loss and enhance quantum yields in activating photocatalysts song et al 2021 uv c compatible qofs have a high cost 10 usd per meter bare fiber another limitation of photocatalyst coated qofs has been reliance on electrostatic interaction based dip coating methods for photocatalysts to adhere to the fiber surface matsuzawa et al 2008 because they are only suitable for metal oxide photocatalysts with strong electrostatic affinity to quartz but not for non metallic ones such as g c3n4 which lacks any cationic charge dip coating methods are also not economically scalable or able to achieve constituent coating quality for example some fabrication techniques form dense coating layers to increase photocatalyst loadings with limited photocatalytic activity and pollutant mass transport efficiency from water into the surface active region thus greatly hindering their pollutant degradation potential ling et al 2017 tugaoen et al 2018 song et al 2021 zhao et al 2021 in addition qofs bare or coated are brittle and breakage during manufacturing or use in water treatment which inherently limits their use in practice polymeric optical fibers hereafter denoted as pofs open up a range of surface coating fabrication techniques which are not limited to the electrostatic fabrication technique pofs possess excellent physical toughness flexibility and durability thus can be fabricated into flexible linear illuminators using a wide range of polymers while not compatible with uv c or uv b wavelengths pofs has excellent light transmittance at wavelengths between 360 and 760 nm thereby covering the spectrum of sunlight or absorption spectra of many uv a and visible light photocatalysts alobaidani et al 2010 pofs can side emitting light that launched into their cores through surface texturing or achieving asymmetries in fiber core cladding geometry by adding specific scatters or fluorescent additives coating polymers differences in refractive indices n or leaving diffusive cavities e g air bubbles spigulis et al 2005 for example low cost pofs 0 015 usd per meter are commercially available with a polymethyl methacrylate pmma npmma 1 49 core and polyvinylidene fluoride pvdf npvdf 1 42 as the outer cladding these structural modifications of pofs enabled a better control of the surface emission of the core transmitted light radiation to prevent light oversaturation along the entire pof length cm to meters spigulis et al 2005 kallweit et al 2021 consequently coating pofs with photocatalysts offer more design opportunities lower costs and are easier to be scale up manufactured compared with photocatalyst coated qofs common methods to fabricate photocatalyst coated pofs include electrostatic interaction based dip coating joo et al 2003 nagakawa et al 2020 atmospheric pressure plasma driven coating baba et al 2017 or polymer assisted dip coating lin et al 2015 the electrostatic interaction based method forms rather thin and unstable photocatalyst layers on pofs joo et al 2003 nagakawa et al 2020 the atmospheric pressure plasma driven coating method forms stable photocatalyst coatings but it requires complicated instrumentation and procedures with high energy and chemical costs baba et al 2017 furthermore this technique forms thin films with low photocatalyst loading and porosity leading to inefficient mass transfer and low reactivity the polymer assisted dip coating method was reported to fabricate photocatalyst coated pofs with better stability and applicable to a wide range of photocatalysts lin et al 2015 while this method takes up to 36 h of curing when fabricating one photocatalyst coated pof which is unfavorable for mass production in addition current fabrication methods with no exception involve additional pretreatment to remove the pvdf cladding of pofs joo et al 2003 nagakawa et al 2020 baba et al 2017 lin et al 2015 given the known scale up challenges that exist there is a need to develop a rapid and robust fabrication method compatible with high throughput manufacturing e g roll to roll at room temperature with low toxicity solvents or photocatalytst particles that can produce low cost photocatalyst coated pofs with high photocatalytic activity inspired by the fabrication of porous pvdf electrospun fibers that utilize rapidly evaporating porogens as good solvents e g acetone for pvdf issa et al 2016 moshfeghian et al 2021 we hypothesize that good solvents for pvdf may modify the pvdf cladding of pofs by dissolving and re solidifying the cladding the re solidification process has the potential to create a metamaterial porous structure consisting of physically immobilized photocatalysts within the walls but exposed to water within the interconnected pores of the pvdf cladding these metamaterials possess exceptional characteristics due to their structure allowing them to guide light to reach the photocatalysts and facilitating quick removal of pollutants from the water into the photocatalyst infused porous cladding within the pof hence the use of good solvents to modify the pvdf cladding of pofs to fabricate photocatalyst coated pofs not only takes the advantage of the existing pvdf cladding but also creates stable photocatalyst embedded metamaterial porous structure on pofs to enable efficient light deliver and pollutant transfer within pofs meanwhile the development of such metamaterials may also provide a new strategy to implement our previous reported photocatalytic chlorine monochloramine activation processes to achieve higher radical yield for pollutant degradation cheng et al 2020 2021 2023 this study presents a new scalable fabrication method to create photocatalyst embedded metamaterial pofs that degrade pollutants in water and are stable over time the specific objectives are 1 to fabricate and characterize the photocatalyst embedded metamaterial pofs using different organic solvents 2 to investigate the mechanisms of how organic solvents influence metamaterial structure formation and 3 to demonstrate the performance of the fabricated photocatalyst embedded metamaterial pofs in different water matrices across multiple treatment use cycles 2 materials and methods 2 1

nom to ddi water stirring overnight and filtering the solution through a 0 45 μm pore size fiber membrane whatman two model pollutants were selected based upon having similar molecular weights but differing molecular charges and widespread use that facilitates comparison to other photocatalyst studies methylene blue mb was used in the initial screening because it has a high molecular weight 320 g mole heterocyclic aromatic structure and cationic behavior which should hinder its diffusion into porous polymer structures thus this represents a potential worse case compared against other lower molecular weight compounds that are among the greatest challenges to treat in water carbamazepine cbz 236 g mole has a carbamoyl substituent at the azepine nitrogen and is used as an anticonvulsant pharmaceutical and is widely present in wastewater or drinking water cbz is widely reported in assessing oxidative water treatment processes sun et al 2019 kim et al 2022 and therefore was used as a

via the polycondensation of melamine at 550 c for 4 h in a furnace cheng et al 2023 suspensions of g c3n4 were prepared in acetone ethanol or water which possess different pvdf dis solubilities and volatilities table s2 100 of each solvent acetone a100 ethanol e100 water w100 was used as three suspensions or mixed into four different suspensions with varying ratios of solvents 80 acetone and 20 ethanol a80 e20 60 acetone and 40 ethanol a60 e40 80 acetone and 20 water a80 w20 and 60 acetone and 40 water a60 w40 these suspensions were continuously mixed and used as pof coating solvents a commercially available 0 75 mm diameter pmma pvdf pof jiangxi daishing pof co ltd was used in a batch coating method fig s1a to produce 7 cm long g c3n4 pof segments and later in a continuous roll to roll process fig s1b to fabricate meter long lengths of uniformly coated g c3n4 pof which were later cut into 40 cm segments for testing both fabrication methods used the same solvent treatment strategy a virgin or bare pof was dipped into the g c3n4 solvent suspension for 3 s removed and allowed to air dry for 10 s the mass loading of g c3n4 on the pof mg cm was determined gravimetrically see details in text s1 the surface morphology and elemental distribution of the virgin and fabricated g c3n4 pofs was characterized using scanning electron microscopy and energy dispersive

combined and submerged into a glass reactor the 7 cm fiber bundles fabricated by the batch method were used in the 150 ml reactor 4 cm diameter which was filled with 100 ml of the model test water a 700 ml reactor 5 cm diameter filled with 600 ml of model test water was used for the 40 cm fiber bundles fabricated by continuous roll to roll method reactors were continuously mixed with a magnetic stir bar light was launched into the bundled g c3n4 pofs from either a 5 w 420 nm light emitting diode led ep u4545k a3 epileds in the 150 ml reactor or a 16 w visible light led led16wrgb hio lighting co ltd in the 700 ml reactor their spectra are shown in fig s2 prior to starting a g c3n4 pofs pollutant degradation experiment the system was pre equilibrated for 30 min in the dark i e led was turned off the led was then turned on to start kinetic experiments in which 1 5 to 2 0 ml of sample were collected over time and analyzed for mb concentration 5 0 mgcl2 l free chlorine which was prepared by diluting the 4 5 naclo stock solution to around 3 0 gcl2 l was only added to the solution in degrading the chlorine refractory micropollutant cbz chlorine was quenched with 5 0 μl of 0 1 m sodium thiosulphate after which cbz were then analyzed in the collected sample control experiments were performed with non coated virgin pofs and a slurry of g c3n4 following a similar manner as ling et al 2017 all experiments were performed in at least duplicate and analyzed in duplicate data on the plots represent the average of these replicates pseudo first order rate constants k were fitted from the changes over time in mb and cbz concentrations the stability over time and the reusability of g c3n4 pofs were examined by conducting 20 consecutive experiments using the micropollutant cbz experiments were performed using both ddi water and the model surface water 2 4 analytical methods residual free chlorine concentration was measured by a dpd colorimetric method apha 2005 the mb

cheng et al 2020 3 results and discussion 3 1 selection of solvents impacts fabrication of g c3n4 pofs the type of solvent used influences the amount of photocatalyst coated on the pofs and the morphology of the metamaterials neither water w100 nor ethanal e100 alone can coat g c3n4 on pofs because ethanol and water are poor solvents incapable of dissolving pvdf fig 1c shows that the g c3n4 mass loading of the pof varies from 0 19 mg cm with 100 acetone a100 to only 0 003 mg cm with a60 w40 other blends of acetone ethanol and or water yielded intermediate g c3n4 mass loadings fig 1c higher mass loadings were achieved using larger percentages of the good solvent i e acetone for pvdf regardless of the second solvent being water or ethanol the order of highest to lowest mass loadings i e a100 a80 e20 a60 e40 a80 w20 a60 w40 trended reasonably well with the saturated vapor pressure of solvents calculated using raoult s law see text s2 the g c3n4 mass loading of the g c3n4 pofs using a100 a80 e20 and a60 e40 decrease linearly with their corresponding saturated vapor pressure fig 1d however using a80 w20 and a60 w40 a significant drop in mass loadings occurred because water in the mixtures significantly increases the dielectric constants of the coating solvents and thus is likely to impede the modification of the high lipophilic pvdf jiang et al 2021 the impacts of the dielectric constants of solvents used in coating on the g c3n4 mass loading were confirmed as seen in fig 1e the g c3n4 mass loading was the highest when using a100 with the lowest dielectric constant 20 8 and decreased hyperbolically with increasing dielectric constants when using a80 e20 21 5 a60 e40 22 2 a80 w20 32 6 and a60 w40 44 5 details in text s2 the three solvent design variables percentage of good solvent saturated vapor pressure and dielectric constant also allowed tunability of the metamaterial morphologies of the fabricated g c3n4 pofs fig 1f 1k a100 produced a rough and porous g c3n4 coating layer fig 1g a80 e20 and a60 e40 also produced a rough surface but with only a few small pores on the surface and most photocatalysts fully or partially covered by pvdf fig 1h and 1i nonetheless a80 w20 and a60 w40 produced smooth surfaces fig 1j and 1k similar to the bare pofs fig 1f porosity of the coated layer is essential so as to allow organic pollutants to diffuse into and throughout the coating layer where it contacts the g c3n4 surface to enable heterogeneous catalysis and or reacts with reactive oxygen species within the pores therefore a good solvent with low dielectric constant and high saturated vapor pressure is crucial in creating a metamaterial consisting of a porous structure containing high mass loadings of g c3n4 on the pof 3 2 selection of solvents impacts adsorption kinetics and photocatalytic performance of g c3n4 pofs the impacts of different mass loadings and metamaterial morphologies from three solvent suspensions a100 a80 e20 and a80 w20 on organic pollutant adsorption capacities and photocatalytic activities were assessed using bundles of 150 individual 7 cm long g c3n4 pofs for mb adsorption and cbz degradation respectively fig 2 a shows negligible adsorption in the dark without leds of mb mb concentration decreased from 2 0 to 1 92 mg l on a80 w20 fabricated g c3n4 pofs presumably due to its low g c3n4 mass loading the g c3n4 pofs fabricated using a100 and a80 e20 rapidly adsorbed mb and approached equilibrium mb concentrations of 0 94 and 1 24 mg l respectively after 30 to 90 min the dark phase adsorption rates represent mass transport kinetic limitations within the porous metamaterial structure followed by mb adsorption to the g c3n4 surface i e no adsorption by the pvdf alone adsorption mass transport rates were fitted using a simple pseudo second order kinetic model dqt dt k2 qe qt 2 where qe is the equilibrium adsorbed mass mgmb g g c3n4 and k2 the associated mass transport rate constant g mg min data fitting is shown in fig 2b statistics provided in text s3 the values qe and k2 of the g c3n4 pofs fabricated using a100 were 0 18 mg g and 1 0 g mg min respectively which were both 50 higher than those fabricated using a80 e20 higher mass transport and capacity related values suggest both larger g c3n4 exposed surface area and more pore structure i e more open pores for a100 in fig 1g versus fig 1h for a80 e20 conducive to faster mass transport of the organic pollutant after a pre adsorption period in the dark negligible cbz was adsorbed by the g c3n4 pofs and the photocatalytic degradation kinetics of cbz were well fitted by pseudo first order kinetics fig s3a the first order reaction rate constant k cbz value was very low for a80 w20 and were higher for a80 e20 and a100 0 013 min 1 and 0 021 min 1 respectively the k cbz values were proportional to g c3n4 mass loading mg cm fig s3b and mb adsorption capacities fig s3c overall a100 created the best metamaterial structure containing the highest mass loading of g c3n4 and interconnected pores capable of rapid micropollutant mass transport and degradation 3 3 mechanisms for formation of g c3n4 pofs metamaterials the above characterization adsorption and degradation experiments showed that a suspension of g c3n4 pure acetone a100 produced a superior metamaterial structure on the pof this section provides additional characterization to justify a mechanistic explanation for their formation the role of acetone in forming metamaterial porous structures was further revealed by characterizing the cross sections fig 3 a 3c and surfaces fig 3d 3f of the bare pofs acetone treated pofs and g c3n4 pofs the pvdf cladding of the g c3n4 pofs fig 3a is thicker than that of bare pofs fig 3b the thicker pvdf layer of g c3n4 pof is attributed to the insertion of g c3n4 into the pvdf cladding as shown in fig 3c acetone alone produced pores in the pvdf layer fig 3d but acetone plus g c3n4 resulted in larger pores and a thicker overall cladding layer we speculate that the rate of acetone evaporation was slower in the presence of g c3n4 fig 3g shows similar peak locations in the ftir spectra of the surfaces for the bare pofs and acetone treated pofs but larger peak intensities were observed after acetone treatment this means that acetone exposure retained the pdvf composition but changed the macroscale structure of the cladding yin et al 2019 compared with acetone treatment alone incorporation of g c3n4 into acetone during treatment of the pvdf layer altered the ftir spectrum fig 3g due to the insertion of g c3n4 into pvdf layer as both g c3n4 and pvdf characteristic peaks were observed ling et al 2023 a stepwise process is proposed in scheme 1 to illustrate the fabrication mechanisms of a metamaterial pof cladding stage 1 involves dissolution of pvdf in acetone which then allows for g c3n4 diffusion based upon a concentration gradient associated with the high g c3n4 concentration in acetone stage 2 allows contiguous pores to form as acetone evaporates out of the gel like g c3n4 pvdf matrix the surface tension of acetone on g c3n4 surfaces prevents these surfaces from being coated with pvdf acetone evaporation induces re solidification of the dissolved pvdf wherein the g c3n4 particles are enmeshed yet exposed to the open pore space an analogy can be made where g c3n4 acts as the aggregate and pvdf serves as the cement binder constructing a metamaterial structure in the pof cladding surface tension of acetone on the g c3n4 surface prevents its complete encapsulation within pvdf which is critical in maintaining surface exposure to water that will later fill the pores as demonstrated in the mb adsorption and cbz catalysis occuring on the surface in figs 2 and 5 finally acetone acts as a sacrificial porogen that creates a contiguous and interconnected pore structure as it evaporates out of the cladding the metamaterial porous structures should be retained regardless of the ratio of aggregate to binder i e g c3n4 and pvdf respectively according to their formation mechanisms modulating the ratio of g c3n4 to pvdf was then examined using various g c3n4 concentrations of 60 100 200 300 1250 and 2000 g l in pure acetone as expected increasing the g c3n4 concentration lead to higher g c3n4 mass loadings that proportional with g c3n4 concentration in acetone fig 4 the highest mass loading achieved 1 2 0 1 mg cm was 2 3 orders of magnitude greater than those fabricated by conventional dip coating and sol gel methods danion et al 2007 ling et al 2017 song et al 2021 zhao et al 2021 surprisingly increasing the g c3n4 concentrations also produced a thicker pvdf based cladding layer swelling by 28x from 3 3 0 1 to 88 8 1 4 μm fig 4 changes in both the g c3n4 mass loading and cladding thickness details in text s4 fig s4 were linearly related mass loading thickness 0 0142 r2 0 99 the density of g c3n4 in the pvdf cladding defined as the g c3n4 mass loading per volume of the g c3n4 coating layer decreased from a high of 0 95 g cm3 at the g c3n4 coating solution concentration of 60 g l to 0 6 g cm3 for g c3n4 coating solution concentrations above 100 g l table s4 and text s5 these densities are lower than either the density of g c3n4 1 22 g cm3 or pvdf 1 76 g cm3 meaning significant pore volumes were produced the highest density of the g c3n4 in the pvdf cladding at the lowest g c3n4 coating solution concentration may because the g c3n4 mass loading is too low to increase the porosity and strengthen the stability of the porous structure as shown in fig s5a the sem images in fig s5b s5f show greater porosity in the pvdf cladding with lower g c3n4 densities i e higher g c3n4 coating solution concentrations as the increasing g c3n4 coating solution concentrations from 60 to 100 g l allow more g c3n4 particles diffuse to the acetone dissolved pvdf layer to form a more porous structures possessing lower densities there are also more g c3n4 surfaces exposed within the metamaterial i e pvdf g c3n4 cladding layer for higher g c3n4 coating solution concentrations based upon proportionally higher mb adsorption capacities in the adsorption experiment results shown in fig s6 3 4 photocatalytic application and stability of bundles of g c3n4 pofs attached to leds bundles of 150 individual g c3n4 pofs fabricated to have more porous and higher g c3n4 mass loading i e lower density cladding should be capable of efficiently facilitating pollutant mass transport and side emitting and utilizing light for photocatalysis within the metamaterial structure first the mb dark adsorption and degradation rate constants for mb kmb were shown to increase by 6x from 0 24 to 1 44 mg and by 11x from 0 035 0 007 to 0 38 0 04 h 1 respectively for mass loadings ranging from 0 05 to 1 2 mg g c3n4 cm fibers on 7 cm fig 5 a this confirmed that pollutant was efficiently transported and light was effectively utilized within the metamaterial structure the stability of metamaterial structure on pofs was assessed using pofs with low 0 07 mg g c3n4 cm fibers and high 1 2 mg g c3n4 cm fibers g c3n4 mass loadings the residual mb concentration treated by 0 07 and 1 2 mg 7 cm g c3n4 pofs bundles during 5 cycles all decreased to around 0 6 and 0 2 mg l fig s7 respectively there were no changes p 0 05 in kmb values across 5 cycles of operation with different g c3n4 mass loaded fibers fig 5b indicating the stability of the metamaterial structure furthermore 4x higher kmb values for the bundled g c3n4 pof reactor were observed compared with the g c3n4 slurry reactors using the same led fig 5c details in text s6 similar trends were observed using bundles of 150 individual 7 cm or 40 cm long g c3n4 pofs fig 5d thus the metamaterial and effective light delivery using the g c3n4 pofs reduce the historical problematic issues of light scattering or occlusion occurring in slurry based reactors that rely upon extremely high photocatalyst loading visible light 420 nm photocatalytic degradation of cbz was achieved using bundles of 150 individual 7 cm g c3n4 pofs in ddi and model surface waters during dark adsorption negligible cbz was adsorbed by the g c3n4 pofs which is consistent with what we previously observed using g c3n4 in suspension cheng et al 2020 cbz degradation over time was well fitted by a pseudo first order rate expression and rate constant kcbz fig s7 for regression and raw data for similar mass loaded fibers 0 27 mg cm the values for kcbz and kmb were comparable and of order of 0 003 min 1 in ddi water compared with ddi water kcbz value was 18 8 lower in model surface water fig 6 a the cbz concentration only decreased from 2 0 to 1 5 and 1 6 μm in ddi and model surface water respectively after 90 min of reaction the inefficient cbz degradation 25 in ddi water and 20 5 in model surface water by the g c3n4 pofs under visible light irradiation is because cbz can only be degraded by the photogenerated holes of g c3n4 while no ho can be produced by g c3n4 generated under visible light irradiation cheng et al 2020 free chlorine was added to the system to boost cbz degradation since chlorine activation by photocatalytic processes were shown previously to enhance cbz oxidation by increasing the ho and clo concentrations in slurry reactors cheng et al 2020 2021 as ho and clo react quickly with cbz at rate constants of 8 8 109 m 1 s 1 and 9 2 107 m 1 s 1 respectively in the presence of 5 0 mgcl2 l free chlorine kcbz values increased by 8x fig 6a and cbz degradation enhanced by 3 5x in ddi water in which the cbz concentration decreased from 2 0 to 0 3 μm after 90 min this was attributed to the enhanced ho and clo yields through chlorine activation by photogenerated electrons superoxide radicals e c b o2 and holes h v b respectively eqs 1 3 cheng et al 2020 2021 leading to an increased equivalent ho exposure from 3 27 10 11 to 2 25 10 10 m s detailed calculation in text s7 even in the presence of free chlorine there was only a 18 2 lower kcbz and a 7 2 less cbz degraded in the model surface water residual cbz concentration 0 4 μm vs ddi water resiudal cbz concentration 0 3 μm which was attributed to the presence of dom ammonia bicarbonate and other inorganic ions competing for chlorine and reactive species hu et al 2019 fig s9 see text s8 for details the presence of a free chlorine residual in water is not a concern for the pofs because both pvdf and pmma are resistant to oxidation by hypochlorous acid or hypochlorite ions fig 6b confirms this stability as across 20 cycles of experiments in the presence of free chlorine in either ddi and model surface waters under accumulated ho exposures of 4 5 10 9 m s showed no change in performance of the pof over longer periods radicals could perhaps oxidize pvdf and this is a focus of longer term pilot testing being considered in terms of the disinfection by products dbps formations the photocatalytic chlorine activation process was also reported to form lower concentrations of dbps than uv chlorine process due to faster decay of chlorine zhang et al

degrading a wide spectrum of aqueous pollutants fig s10 in addition other inorganic semiconductor photocatalyst such as tio2 can also be coated on the pofs following the same fabrication method the kcbz values of the tio2 pofs under 390 nm led irradiation were comparable with those of the g c3n4 pofs under 420 nm led irradiation fig s11 4 conclusions in this study high mass loading g c3n4 embedded metamaterial porous structures on pofs were fabricated and demonstrated to have great potential in overcoming the limitations of conventional photocatalytic reactors the synthesis process shown here for a pvdf acetone g c3n4 system can likely be applied to other polymers solvents and photocatalysts to produce similar metamaterials suitable for photocatalysis on pofs with comparable formation mechanisms the fabricated high loading and porous photocatalyst coated pofs showed remarkable versatility in more practical photocatalytic reactor designs by adjusting the numbers of packed fibers as well as their coating mass the reactor can be performed at different equivalent photocatalyst concentrations and fiber volume ratios such versatility allows the photocatalytic processes to

14655,the performance of conventional photocatalytic reactors suffers from low photocatalyst mass loading densities affixed to surfaces and light scattering losses or light attenuation in slurry reactors these limitations are overcome by fabrication of high mass loading g c3n4 embedded metamaterial porous structures on flexible polymeric optical fibers g c3n4 pofs in this study the fabricated g c3n4 pofs contain g c3n4 with mass loading 100 1000x higher than previouly reported enabling efficient light delivery to g c3n4 and improved pollutant mass transport within metamaterial porous structures the key fabrication step involved using acetone based on its high saturated vapor pressure and low dielectric constant making roll to roll mass production of high mass loading photocatalyst embedded metamaterial pofs possible at room temperature within seconds using bundles of 150 individual g c3n4 pofs in the reactors we achieved 4x higher degradation rates for micropollutants under visible light irradiation at 420 nm compared with equivalent mass to volume ratios of photocatalysts in a slurry suspension reactor the bundled g c3n4 pof reactor showed no degradation in the structural integrity or loss of pollutant degradation using deionized or model drinking water under accumulated ho exposures of 4 5 10 9 m s after 20 cycles of treatment it operates continuously at g c3n4 dosages equivalent to 100 1000 g l and a water depth over 40 cm making it a feasible alternative to conventional photocatalytic reactors graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords

have enormous potential to address environment pollution or energy challenges through water splitting nakata and fujishima 2012 boyjoo et al 2017 ahmed et al 2018 however the efficiency of most photocatalytic slurry based applications is limited by the need to recover the photocatalysts from water and the light scattering or occlusion by photocatalysts and other aqueous constituents reduce the photonic quantum efficiency de lasa et al 2005 immobilizing photocatalysts on supporting media including the quartz protection tube of uv lamps cho et al 2007 yoo et al 2015 reactor walls dijkstra et al 2001 van grieken et al 2009 nickheslat et al 2013 mesh bestetti et al 2010 wang et al 2018 membranes horovitz et al 2016 plates hakki et al 2019 and sponges su et al 2018 li et al 2020 can eliminate the energy requirements associated with catalyst recovery but does not prevent light scattering or occlusion by aqueous constituents and sometimes even exacerbated by supporting media binjhade et al 2022 for example photocatalysts immobilized in fixed bed film reactors degrading clofibric acid achieved lower quantum yields 44 to 65 compared against those by equivalent photocatalyst loadings in slurry manassero et al 2017 in contrast photocatalyst coated optical fibers show great potential to solve the aforementioned challenges by light attenuation scattering or occlusion because light is delivered from within the fiber to catalysts mounted on the fiber surface which is in contact with water containing pollutants peill et al 1995 danion et al 2007 xu et al 2008 ling et al 2017 tugaoen et al 2018 visan et al 2019 song et al 2021 zhao et al 2021 such a strategy achieved 2x to 5x higher quantum yields than those of equivalent photocatalyst loading in slurry in degrading malic acid danion et al 2007 or methylene blue ling et al 2017 an added benefit of this inside out light delivery by optical fibers is that photocatalyst coated optical fibers can be used in waters with low transmittance such as colored groundwaters turbid surface water activated sludge bioreactors with high biomass levels ni et al 2022 and even colored industrial wastewater most photocatalyst coated optical fiber studies use one or only a few fibers in batch reactors and a key limitation of larger scale investigations has been in creating low cost scalable manufacturing of photocatalyst coated optical fibers capable of using energy efficient light sources quartz optical fibers hereafter denoted as qofs have high uv c transmittance and have been the most widely reported approach to fabricate photocatalyst coated optical fibers peill et al 1995 danion et al 2007 xu et al 2008 ling et al 2017 tugaoen et al 2018 song et al 2021 zhao et al 2021 as light propagates along the qof core photons either refract out from the fiber core modes 1 and 2 in fig 1 a peill et al 1995 danion et al 2007 xu et al 2008 ling et al 2017 tugaoen et al 2018 song et al 2021 zhao et al 2021 or generate evanescent energy waves mode 3 in fig 1a to activate photocatalysts coated on the surface ling et al 2017 song et al 2021 zhao et al 2021 fabrication of metamaterial structures of surface coated photocatalyst layers minimizes refracted light and maximizes evanescent waves generated during total internal reflection to reduce light loss and enhance quantum yields in activating photocatalysts song et al 2021 uv c compatible qofs have a high cost 10 usd per meter bare fiber another limitation of photocatalyst coated qofs has been reliance on electrostatic interaction based dip coating methods for photocatalysts to adhere to the fiber surface matsuzawa et al 2008 because they are only suitable for metal oxide photocatalysts with strong electrostatic affinity to quartz but not for non metallic ones such as g c3n4 which lacks any cationic charge dip coating methods are also not economically scalable or able to achieve constituent coating quality for example some fabrication techniques form dense coating layers to increase photocatalyst loadings with limited photocatalytic activity and pollutant mass transport efficiency from water into the surface active region thus greatly hindering their pollutant degradation potential ling et al 2017 tugaoen et al 2018 song et al 2021 zhao et al 2021 in addition qofs bare or coated are brittle and breakage during manufacturing or use in water treatment which inherently limits their use in practice polymeric optical fibers hereafter denoted as pofs open up a range of surface coating fabrication techniques which are not limited to the electrostatic fabrication technique pofs possess excellent physical toughness flexibility and durability thus can be fabricated into flexible linear illuminators using a wide range of polymers while not compatible with uv c or uv b wavelengths pofs has excellent light transmittance at wavelengths between 360 and 760 nm thereby covering the spectrum of sunlight or absorption spectra of many uv a and visible light photocatalysts alobaidani et al 2010 pofs can side emitting light that launched into their cores through surface texturing or achieving asymmetries in fiber core cladding geometry by adding specific scatters or fluorescent additives coating polymers differences in refractive indices n or leaving diffusive cavities e g air bubbles spigulis et al 2005 for example low cost pofs 0 015 usd per meter are commercially available with a polymethyl methacrylate pmma npmma 1 49 core and polyvinylidene fluoride pvdf npvdf 1 42 as the outer cladding these structural modifications of pofs enabled a better control of the surface emission of the core transmitted light radiation to prevent light oversaturation along the entire pof length cm to meters spigulis et al 2005 kallweit et al 2021 consequently coating pofs with photocatalysts offer more design opportunities lower costs and are easier to be scale up manufactured compared with photocatalyst coated qofs common methods to fabricate photocatalyst coated pofs include electrostatic interaction based dip coating joo et al 2003 nagakawa et al 2020 atmospheric pressure plasma driven coating baba et al 2017 or polymer assisted dip coating lin et al 2015 the electrostatic interaction based method forms rather thin and unstable photocatalyst layers on pofs joo et al 2003 nagakawa et al 2020 the atmospheric pressure plasma driven coating method forms stable photocatalyst coatings but it requires complicated instrumentation and procedures with high energy and chemical costs baba et al 2017 furthermore this technique forms thin films with low photocatalyst loading and porosity leading to inefficient mass transfer and low reactivity the polymer assisted dip coating method was reported to fabricate photocatalyst coated pofs with better stability and applicable to a wide range of photocatalysts lin et al 2015 while this method takes up to 36 h of curing when fabricating one photocatalyst coated pof which is unfavorable for mass production in addition current fabrication methods with no exception involve additional pretreatment to remove the pvdf cladding of pofs joo et al 2003 nagakawa et al 2020 baba et al 2017 lin et al 2015 given the known scale up challenges that exist there is a need to develop a rapid and robust fabrication method compatible with high throughput manufacturing e g roll to roll at room temperature with low toxicity solvents or photocatalytst particles that can produce low cost photocatalyst coated pofs with high photocatalytic activity inspired by the fabrication of porous pvdf electrospun fibers that utilize rapidly evaporating porogens as good solvents e g acetone for pvdf issa et al 2016 moshfeghian et al 2021 we hypothesize that good solvents for pvdf may modify the pvdf cladding of pofs by dissolving and re solidifying the cladding the re solidification process has the potential to create a metamaterial porous structure consisting of physically immobilized photocatalysts within the walls but exposed to water within the interconnected pores of the pvdf cladding these metamaterials possess exceptional characteristics due to their structure allowing them to guide light to reach the photocatalysts and facilitating quick removal of pollutants from the water into the photocatalyst infused porous cladding within the pof hence the use of good solvents to modify the pvdf cladding of pofs to fabricate photocatalyst coated pofs not only takes the advantage of the existing pvdf cladding but also creates stable photocatalyst embedded metamaterial porous structure on pofs to enable efficient light deliver and pollutant transfer within pofs meanwhile the development of such metamaterials may also provide a new strategy to implement our previous reported photocatalytic chlorine monochloramine activation processes to achieve higher radical yield for pollutant degradation cheng et al 2020 2021 2023 this study presents a new scalable fabrication method to create photocatalyst embedded metamaterial pofs that degrade pollutants in water and are stable over time the specific objectives are 1 to fabricate and characterize the photocatalyst embedded metamaterial pofs using different organic solvents 2 to investigate the mechanisms of how organic solvents influence metamaterial structure formation and 3 to demonstrate the performance of the fabricated photocatalyst embedded metamaterial pofs in different water matrices across multiple treatment use cycles 2 materials and methods 2 1

nom to ddi water stirring overnight and filtering the solution through a 0 45 μm pore size fiber membrane whatman two model pollutants were selected based upon having similar molecular weights but differing molecular charges and widespread use that facilitates comparison to other photocatalyst studies methylene blue mb was used in the initial screening because it has a high molecular weight 320 g mole heterocyclic aromatic structure and cationic behavior which should hinder its diffusion into porous polymer structures thus this represents a potential worse case compared against other lower molecular weight compounds that are among the greatest challenges to treat in water carbamazepine cbz 236 g mole has a carbamoyl substituent at the azepine nitrogen and is used as an anticonvulsant pharmaceutical and is widely present in wastewater or drinking water cbz is widely reported in assessing oxidative water treatment processes sun et al 2019 kim et al 2022 and therefore was used as a

via the polycondensation of melamine at 550 c for 4 h in a furnace cheng et al 2023 suspensions of g c3n4 were prepared in acetone ethanol or water which possess different pvdf dis solubilities and volatilities table s2 100 of each solvent acetone a100 ethanol e100 water w100 was used as three suspensions or mixed into four different suspensions with varying ratios of solvents 80 acetone and 20

commercially available 0 75 mm diameter pmma pvdf pof jiangxi daishing pof co ltd was used in a batch coating method fig s1a to produce 7 cm long g c3n4 pof segments and later in a continuous roll to roll process fig s1b to fabricate meter long lengths of uniformly coated g c3n4 pof which were later cut into 40 cm segments for testing both fabrication methods used the same solvent treatment strategy a virgin or bare pof was dipped into the g c3n4 solvent suspension for 3 s removed and allowed to air dry for 10 s the mass loading of g c3n4 on the pof mg cm was determined gravimetrically

700 ml reactor 5 cm diameter filled with 600 ml of model test water was used for the 40 cm fiber bundles fabricated by continuous roll to roll method reactors were continuously mixed with a magnetic stir bar light was launched into the bundled g c3n4 pofs from either a 5 w 420 nm light emitting diode led ep u4545k a3 epileds in the 150 ml reactor or a 16 w visible light led led16wrgb hio lighting co ltd in the 700 ml reactor their spectra are shown in fig s2 prior to starting a g c3n4 pofs pollutant degradation experiment the system was pre equilibrated for 30 min in the dark i e led was turned off the led was then turned on to start kinetic experiments in which 1 5 to 2 0 ml of sample were collected over time and analyzed for mb concentration 5 0 mgcl2 l free chlorine which was prepared by diluting the 4 5 naclo stock solution to around 3 0 gcl2 l was only added to the solution in degrading the chlorine refractory micropollutant cbz chlorine was quenched with 5 0 μl of 0 1 m sodium thiosulphate after which cbz were then analyzed in the collected sample control experiments were performed with non coated virgin pofs and a slurry of g c3n4 following a similar manner as ling et al 2017 all experiments were performed in at least duplicate and analyzed in duplicate data on the plots represent the average of these replicates pseudo first order rate constants k were fitted from the changes over time in mb and cbz concentrations the stability over time and the reusability of g c3n4 pofs were examined by conducting 20 consecutive experiments using the micropollutant cbz

cheng et al 2020 3 results and discussion 3 1 selection of solvents impacts fabrication of g c3n4 pofs the type of solvent used influences the amount of photocatalyst coated on the pofs and the morphology of the metamaterials neither water w100 nor ethanal e100 alone can coat g c3n4 on pofs because ethanol and water are poor solvents incapable of dissolving pvdf fig 1c shows that the g c3n4 mass loading of the pof varies from 0 19 mg cm with 100 acetone a100 to only 0 003 mg cm with a60 w40 other blends of acetone ethanol and or water yielded intermediate g c3n4 mass loadings fig 1c higher mass loadings were achieved using larger percentages of the good solvent i e acetone for pvdf regardless of the second solvent being water or ethanol the order of highest to lowest mass loadings i e a100 a80 e20 a60 e40 a80 w20 a60 w40 trended reasonably well with the saturated vapor pressure of solvents calculated using raoult s law see text s2 the g c3n4 mass loading of the g c3n4 pofs using a100 a80 e20 and a60 e40 decrease linearly with their corresponding saturated vapor pressure fig 1d however using a80 w20 and a60 w40 a significant drop in mass loadings occurred because water in the mixtures significantly increases the dielectric constants of the coating solvents and thus is likely to impede the modification of the high lipophilic pvdf jiang et al 2021 the impacts of the dielectric constants of solvents used in coating on the g c3n4 mass loading were confirmed as seen in fig 1e the g c3n4 mass loading was the highest when using a100 with the lowest dielectric constant 20 8 and decreased hyperbolically with increasing dielectric constants when using a80 e20 21 5 a60 e40 22 2 a80 w20 32 6 and a60 w40 44 5 details in text s2 the three solvent design variables percentage of good solvent saturated vapor pressure and dielectric constant also allowed tunability of the metamaterial morphologies of the fabricated g c3n4 pofs fig 1f 1k a100 produced a rough and porous g c3n4 coating layer fig 1g a80 e20 and a60 e40 also produced a rough surface but with only a few small pores on the surface and most photocatalysts fully or partially covered by pvdf fig 1h and 1i nonetheless a80 w20 and a60 w40 produced smooth surfaces fig 1j and 1k similar to the bare pofs fig 1f porosity of the coated layer is essential so as to allow organic pollutants to diffuse into and throughout the coating layer where it contacts the g c3n4 surface to enable heterogeneous catalysis and or reacts with reactive oxygen species within the pores therefore a good solvent with low dielectric constant and high saturated vapor pressure is crucial in creating a metamaterial consisting of a porous structure containing high mass loadings of g c3n4 on the pof 3 2 selection of solvents impacts adsorption kinetics and photocatalytic performance of g c3n4 pofs the impacts of different mass loadings and metamaterial morphologies from three solvent suspensions a100 a80 e20 and a80 w20 on organic pollutant adsorption capacities and photocatalytic activities were assessed using bundles of 150 individual 7 cm long g c3n4 pofs for mb adsorption and cbz degradation respectively fig 2 a shows negligible adsorption in the dark without leds of mb mb concentration decreased from 2 0 to 1 92 mg l on a80 w20 fabricated g c3n4 pofs presumably due to its low g c3n4 mass loading the g c3n4 pofs fabricated using a100 and a80 e20 rapidly adsorbed mb and approached equilibrium mb concentrations of 0 94 and 1 24 mg l respectively after 30 to 90 min the dark phase adsorption rates represent mass transport kinetic limitations within the porous metamaterial structure followed by mb adsorption to the g c3n4 surface i e no adsorption by the pvdf alone adsorption mass transport rates were fitted using a simple pseudo second order kinetic model dqt dt k2 qe qt 2 where qe is the equilibrium adsorbed mass mgmb g g c3n4 and k2 the associated mass transport rate constant g mg min data fitting is shown in fig 2b statistics provided in text s3 the values qe and k2 of the g c3n4 pofs fabricated using a100 were 0 18 mg g and 1 0 g mg min respectively which were both 50 higher than those fabricated using a80 e20 higher mass transport and capacity related values suggest both larger g c3n4 exposed surface area and more pore structure i e more open pores for a100 in fig 1g versus fig 1h for a80 e20 conducive to faster mass transport of the organic pollutant after a pre adsorption period in the dark negligible cbz was adsorbed by the g c3n4 pofs and the photocatalytic degradation kinetics of cbz were well fitted by pseudo first order kinetics fig s3a the first order reaction rate constant k cbz value was very low for a80 w20 and were higher for a80 e20 and a100 0 013 min 1 and 0 021 min 1 respectively the k cbz values were proportional to g c3n4 mass loading mg cm fig s3b and mb adsorption capacities fig s3c overall a100 created the best metamaterial structure containing the highest mass loading of g c3n4 and interconnected pores capable of rapid micropollutant mass transport and degradation 3 3 mechanisms for formation of g c3n4 pofs metamaterials the above characterization adsorption and degradation experiments showed that a suspension of g c3n4 pure acetone a100 produced a superior metamaterial structure on the pof this section provides additional characterization to justify a mechanistic explanation for their formation the role of acetone in forming metamaterial porous structures was further revealed by characterizing the cross sections fig 3 a 3c and surfaces fig 3d 3f of the bare pofs acetone treated pofs and g c3n4 pofs the pvdf cladding of the g c3n4 pofs fig 3a is thicker than that of bare pofs fig 3b the thicker pvdf layer of g c3n4 pof is attributed to the insertion of g c3n4 into the pvdf cladding as shown in fig 3c acetone alone produced pores in the pvdf layer fig 3d but acetone plus g c3n4 resulted in larger pores and a thicker overall cladding layer we speculate that the rate of acetone evaporation was slower in the presence of g c3n4 fig 3g shows similar peak locations in the ftir spectra of the surfaces for the bare pofs and acetone treated pofs but larger peak intensities were observed after acetone treatment this means that acetone exposure retained the pdvf composition but changed the macroscale structure of the cladding yin et al 2019 compared with acetone treatment alone incorporation of g c3n4 into acetone during treatment of the pvdf layer altered the ftir spectrum fig 3g due to the insertion of g c3n4 into pvdf layer as both g c3n4 and pvdf characteristic peaks were observed ling et al 2023 a stepwise process is proposed in scheme 1 to illustrate the fabrication mechanisms of a metamaterial pof cladding stage 1 involves dissolution of pvdf in acetone which then allows for g c3n4 diffusion based upon a concentration gradient associated with the high g c3n4 concentration in acetone stage 2 allows contiguous pores to form as acetone evaporates out of the gel like g c3n4 pvdf matrix the surface tension of acetone on g c3n4 surfaces prevents these surfaces from being coated with pvdf acetone evaporation induces re solidification of the dissolved pvdf wherein the g c3n4 particles are enmeshed yet exposed to the open pore space an analogy can be made where g c3n4 acts as the aggregate and pvdf serves as the cement binder constructing a metamaterial structure in the pof cladding surface tension of acetone on the g c3n4 surface prevents its complete encapsulation within pvdf which is critical in maintaining surface exposure to water that will later fill the pores as demonstrated in the mb adsorption and cbz catalysis occuring on the surface in figs 2 and 5 finally acetone acts as a sacrificial porogen that creates a contiguous and interconnected pore structure as it evaporates out of the cladding the metamaterial porous structures should be retained regardless of the ratio of aggregate to binder i e g c3n4 and pvdf respectively according to their formation mechanisms modulating the ratio of g c3n4 to pvdf was then examined using various g c3n4 concentrations of 60 100 200 300 1250 and 2000 g l in pure acetone as expected increasing the g c3n4 concentration lead to higher g c3n4 mass loadings that proportional with g c3n4 concentration in acetone fig 4 the highest mass loading achieved 1 2 0 1 mg cm was 2 3 orders of magnitude greater than those fabricated by conventional dip coating and sol gel methods danion et al 2007 ling et al 2017 song et al 2021 zhao et al 2021 surprisingly increasing the g c3n4 concentrations also produced a thicker pvdf based cladding layer swelling by 28x from 3 3 0 1 to 88 8 1 4 μm fig 4 changes in both the g c3n4 mass loading and cladding thickness details in text s4 fig s4 were linearly related mass loading thickness 0 0142 r2 0 99 the density of g c3n4 in the pvdf cladding defined as the g c3n4 mass loading per volume of the g c3n4 coating layer decreased from a high of 0 95 g cm3 at the g c3n4 coating solution concentration of 60 g l to 0 6 g cm3 for g c3n4 coating solution concentrations above 100 g l table s4 and text s5 these densities are lower than either the density of g c3n4 1 22 g cm3 or pvdf 1 76 g cm3 meaning significant pore volumes were produced the highest density of the g c3n4 in the pvdf cladding at the lowest g c3n4 coating solution concentration may because the g c3n4 mass loading is too low to increase the porosity and strengthen the stability of the porous structure as shown in fig s5a the sem images in fig s5b s5f show greater porosity in the pvdf cladding with lower g c3n4 densities i e higher g c3n4 coating solution concentrations as the increasing g c3n4 coating solution concentrations from 60 to 100 g l allow more g c3n4 particles diffuse to the acetone dissolved pvdf layer to form a more porous structures possessing lower densities there are also more g c3n4 surfaces exposed within the metamaterial i e pvdf g c3n4 cladding layer for higher g c3n4 coating solution concentrations based upon proportionally higher mb adsorption capacities in the adsorption experiment results shown in fig s6 3 4 photocatalytic application and stability of bundles of g c3n4 pofs attached to leds bundles of 150 individual g c3n4 pofs fabricated to have more porous and higher g c3n4 mass loading i e lower density cladding should be capable of efficiently facilitating pollutant mass transport and side emitting and utilizing light for photocatalysis within the metamaterial structure first the mb dark adsorption and degradation rate constants for mb kmb were shown to increase by 6x from 0 24 to 1 44 mg and by 11x from 0 035 0 007 to 0 38 0 04 h 1 respectively for mass loadings ranging from 0 05 to 1 2 mg g c3n4 cm fibers on 7 cm fig 5 a this confirmed that pollutant was efficiently transported and light was effectively utilized within the metamaterial structure the stability of metamaterial structure on pofs was assessed using pofs with low 0 07 mg g c3n4 cm fibers and high 1 2 mg g c3n4 cm fibers g c3n4 mass loadings the residual mb concentration treated by 0 07 and 1 2 mg 7 cm g c3n4 pofs bundles during 5 cycles all decreased to around 0 6 and 0 2 mg l fig s7 respectively there were no changes p 0 05 in kmb values across 5 cycles of operation with different g c3n4 mass loaded fibers fig 5b indicating the stability of the metamaterial structure furthermore 4x higher kmb values for the bundled g c3n4 pof reactor were observed compared with the g c3n4 slurry reactors using the same led fig 5c details in text s6 similar trends were observed using bundles of 150 individual 7 cm or 40 cm long g c3n4 pofs fig 5d thus the metamaterial and effective light delivery using the g c3n4 pofs reduce the historical problematic issues of light scattering or occlusion occurring in slurry based reactors that rely upon extremely high photocatalyst loading visible light 420 nm photocatalytic degradation of cbz was achieved using bundles of 150 individual 7 cm g c3n4 pofs in ddi and model surface waters during dark adsorption negligible cbz was adsorbed by the g c3n4 pofs which is consistent with what we previously observed using g c3n4 in suspension cheng et al 2020 cbz degradation over time was well fitted by a pseudo first order rate expression and rate constant kcbz fig s7 for regression and raw data for similar mass loaded fibers 0 27 mg cm the values for kcbz and kmb were comparable and of order of 0 003 min 1 in ddi water compared with ddi water kcbz value was 18 8 lower in model surface water fig 6 a the cbz concentration only decreased from 2 0 to 1 5 and 1 6 μm in ddi and model surface water respectively after 90 min of reaction the inefficient cbz degradation 25 in ddi water and 20 5 in model surface water by the g c3n4 pofs under visible light irradiation is because cbz can only be degraded by the photogenerated holes of g c3n4 while no ho can be produced by g c3n4 generated under visible light irradiation cheng et al 2020 free chlorine was added to the system to boost cbz degradation since chlorine activation by photocatalytic processes were shown previously to enhance cbz oxidation by increasing the ho and clo concentrations in slurry reactors cheng et al 2020 2021 as ho and clo react quickly with cbz at rate constants of 8 8 109 m 1 s 1 and 9 2 107 m 1 s 1 respectively in the presence of 5 0 mgcl2 l free chlorine kcbz values increased by 8x fig 6a and cbz degradation enhanced by 3 5x in ddi water in which the cbz concentration decreased from 2 0 to 0 3 μm after 90 min this was attributed to the enhanced ho and clo yields through chlorine activation by photogenerated electrons superoxide radicals e c b o2 and holes h v b respectively eqs 1 3 cheng et al 2020 2021 leading to an increased equivalent ho exposure from 3 27 10 11 to 2 25 10 10 m s detailed calculation in text s7 even in the presence of free chlorine there was only a 18 2 lower kcbz and a 7 2 less cbz degraded in the model surface water residual cbz concentration 0 4 μm vs ddi water resiudal cbz concentration 0 3 μm which was attributed to the presence of dom ammonia bicarbonate and other inorganic ions competing for chlorine and reactive species hu et al 2019 fig s9 see text s8 for details the presence of a free chlorine residual in water is not a concern for the pofs because both pvdf and pmma are resistant to oxidation by hypochlorous acid or hypochlorite ions fig 6b confirms this stability as across 20 cycles of experiments in the presence of free chlorine in either ddi and model surface waters under accumulated ho exposures of 4 5 10 9 m s showed no change in performance of the pof over longer periods radicals could perhaps oxidize pvdf and this is a focus of longer term pilot testing being considered in terms of the disinfection by products dbps formations the photocatalytic chlorine activation process was also reported to form lower concentrations of dbps than uv chlorine process due to faster decay of chlorine zhang et al

degrading a wide spectrum of aqueous pollutants fig s10 in addition other inorganic semiconductor photocatalyst such as tio2 can also be coated on the pofs following the same fabrication method the kcbz values of the tio2 pofs under 390 nm led irradiation were comparable with those of the g c3n4 pofs under 420 nm led irradiation fig s11 4 conclusions in this study high mass loading g c3n4 embedded metamaterial porous structures on pofs were fabricated and demonstrated to have great potential in overcoming the limitations of conventional photocatalytic reactors the synthesis process shown here for a pvdf acetone g c3n4 system can likely be applied to other polymers solvents and photocatalysts to produce similar metamaterials suitable for photocatalysis on pofs with comparable formation mechanisms the fabricated high loading and porous photocatalyst coated pofs showed remarkable versatility in more practical photocatalytic reactor designs by adjusting the numbers of packed

14656,microplastics mps and their derivatives have received worldwide attention owing to their adverse effects on ecosystems however molecular diversity and dynamic formation of dissolved organic matter dom during the photoaging of mps remain unclear herein we explored a molecular level formation mechanism for polystyrene mp mpps derived dom psdom during the photoaging of mps to explain the evolution heterogeneity and sequential response of molecules to irradiation two dimensional correlation spectroscopy was applied to correlate the variations of psdom molecules detected by fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry with those of mpps functional groups detected by fourier transform infrared spectroscopy irradiation induced psdom contained the most highly unsaturated structures with oxygen but showed fewer aromatic structures than natural aquatic dom photochemical transformations occurred between saturated reduced and oxidized molecules during psdom leaching with the low oxidized and high oxidized molecules undergoing considerable changes in the normal carbon oxidation state and molecular number respectively the primary sequential response of psdom molecules to increasing irradiation time low oxidized high weight 450 m z 800 high oxidized saturated low weight molecules m z 450 corresponded to the response of mpps functional groups aromatic c h carbonyl aromatic ring ch2 bend c h groups demonstrating well synergistic relationships between them these novel findings will contribute to the understanding of underappreciated behaviors or risks of mpdom in aquatic ecosystems graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords molecular parameters fluorescence properties unique molecules heterogeneous correlations leaching responses dynamic formation data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction microplastics mps with size 5 mm have attracted worldwide attention with a major concern for ecological health sun et al 2022 high concentration of mps has been found in aquatic ecosystems as water networks collect plastics from extensive anthropogenic sources bai et al 2022 he et al 2023 mai et al 2019 reported that the annual riverine input of mps in the pearl river delta china was 2400 3800 tons of plastic debris mps is carbon based chain structures and the chemical modification of mps induced by aging processes causes severe damage to these structures releasing substantial quantities of dissolved organic matter mpdom into waters disrupting the existing carbon cycle lee et al 2022 ren et al 2022 however despite mpdom is becoming more prevalent in aquatic ecosystems little is known about its leaching properties and molecular diversity a comprehensive understanding of the complex molecular composition of mpdom and its dynamic formation is necessary to accurately predict the emerging risks of mps in aquatic ecosystems uv irradiation is a strong driving force for the production of mpdom from mps photoaging the humic like components in mpdom are much visible under uv irradiation and the protein phenol like components can serve as good fluorescent representations for dom from bisphenol a containing mps lee et al 2020 therefore identifying the fluorescent and molecular compounds in irradiation derived mpdom is essential as they control their fate in aquatic ecosystems the excitation emission matrix parallel factor analysis eem parafac and fourier transform infrared spectrometry ftir have been applied to track the spectral signatures of irradiation derived mpdom from mineral adsorption lee and hur 2020 chlorine disinfection lee et al 2020 and copper interaction lee et al 2021 however few efforts have been made to explore the molecular composition and transformation of irradiation derived mpdom using high resolution mass spectrometry fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry ft icr ms with unparalleled mass resolving power has been developed to provide valuable molecular information of natural dom chen et al 2022 the joint analysis of spectral and ft icr ms datasets will help understand the molecular complexity of mpdom however the complementary information linking the molecular composition and spectroscopic parameters of mpdom is still highly required the leaching behavior of mpdom depends on the photodegradation conditions which makes remarkable diversity of molecules however the molecular level interrelationships in the changes between mpdom formation and mps degradation during irradiation remain unanswered owing to the lack of methods to link heterogeneous datasets on mpdom molecules and mps functional groups to overcome this issue two dimensional correlation spectroscopy 2d cos can improve the spectral resolution along two dimensions and establish the relationships between different probe signals song et al 2023 2d cos has advantages in revealing the sequential order of dynamic spectral variables in response to external perturbations huang et al 2012 abdulla et al 2013 joint 2d cos analysis of heterogeneous spectrum and mass datasets e g ft icr ms vs ftir is believed to facilitate a comprehensive understanding of the dynamic characteristics and formation mechanism of mpdom during mps photoaging nevertheless this topic is rarely explored at the molecular level we hypothesize that there are diversity heterogeneity and sequential responses of mpdom molecules with increasing irradiation time which can be closely related to the stepwise photodegradation of mps functional groups such an explicit analysis of targeted datasets allows for a better mechanistic interpretation of irradiation induced mpdom formation herein the dynamic formation mechanism of psdom during the photoaging of polystyrene mp mpps with increasing irradiation time were elucidated using 2d cos combined with ft icr ms and spectroscopic techniques the objectives were to 1 characterize the molecular diversity of irradiation induced psdom and its association with fluorescent components 2 explore the heterogeneous correlations and dynamic leaching responses of individual psdom molecules to increasing irradiation time 3 evaluate the reaction heterogeneities sequential responses and interrelationships of psdom molecules with photoaged mpps functional groups and 4 try to propose a molecular level dynamic formation mechanism of psdom 2 materials and methods 2 1 psdom leaching experiments during mpps photoaging the leaching experiments of psdom during mpps photoaging were conducted in a photochemical reactor equipped with a 500 w mercury lamp and recycled cooling system 25 c 0 5 c in the dark and under uv light eight groups of 5 0 g plastic l 1 mpps were added to eight 1l sterilized glass bottles and then shaken at 250 rpm during the designated times of 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 and 8 d each batch of mpps mixing solutions was separately filtered through a 0 45 μm filter membrane to obtain psdom supernatants named filtered psdomx x day and photoaged mpps to guarantee the priority of psdom research a widely used 0 45 μm membrane was selected for separation to better reflect the original properties of psdom the pretreatments avoided mechanical damages to original size of mpps minimizing the formation of nanoplastics during mpps photoaging control experiments without mpps were conducted simultaneously as blanks the leaching experiment was performed in duplicate because the internal space design of photochemical reactor used allowed complete the duplicate photoaging experiments in the same batch at one time this one time duplicate experiment at the same time and in the same space can effectively reduce the deviation caused by the experiment frequency and ensure the consistency of operation and the validity of data under the same photoaging condition the filtered psdom from each day s irradiation were subjected to uv photoaging for one more day s irradiation to explore the degradation of psdom itself named photoaged psdomx 1 moreover aquatic dom adom of suwannee river dom srdom fulvic acid srfa and humic acid srha were purchased from ihss as a comparison of psdom 10 mgc l 1 srdom was selected for photoaging experiments in the same photochemical reactor under the same photoaging conditions as mpps after designated photoaging times of 2 5 and 8 d srdom solutions was filtered through a 0 45 μm filter membrane and stored for later measurement 2 2 spectroscopic measurements of psdom adom and photoaged mpps uv vis eem and ftir spectra of filtered psdom before and after solid phase extraction spe treatment photoaged psdom srdom and photoaged mpps were measured using a spectrophotometer fluorescence spectrometer and ftir spectrometer respectively detailed measurement preparation settings and spectral data preprocessing are shown in the supporting information murphy et al 2010 ohno 2002 lawaetz and stedmon 2009 eem ftir measurements of spe purified psdom were used to better compare with molecular properties and to reduce the influence of possible nanoplastics in solutions on spectroscopic measurements due to the size particularity of nanoplastics it is difficult to reduce the impact of possible nanoplastics to zero therefore it is still necessary to develop effective technologies taking into account both the removal of nanoplastics and the maintenance of original properties of psdom 2 3 ft icr ms measurements of psdom and adom a widely accepted spe treatment was conducted to purify psdom due to the highly representative sample characters in isolates liu et al 2023 standard procedures and appropriate extraction efficiency of spe treatment ensured proper quality control spe ppl cartridges were purified with 20 ml methanol and acidified ultrapure water the filtered psdom were adjusted to ph 2 and then injected into cartridges the cartridges was washed with 20 ml acidified ultrapure water and dried with n2 flow the adsorbed psdom was eluted out from the cartridges with 10 ml methanol moreover part of psdom extracts were dried under n2 and dissolved in ultrapure water for doc and spectroscopic measurements extraction efficiency was calculated as the doc in methanol extract divided by doc in the corresponding psdom the previously determined mean doc extraction efficiency 60 of used spe ppl was consistent with those reported by dittmar et al 2008 although spe treatment may selectively adsorbed organic compounds in psdom it is an essential pretreatment for ft icr ms analysis providing rich and comparable molecular information ft icr ms measurements of psdom and adom were conducted using an ultra apex ft icr mass spectrometer bruker daltonics bremen germany with a 9 4 t superconducting magnet interfaced with negative ion electrospray ionization the purified psdom adom 50 mg l 1 was injected into an electrospray source at 250 μl h 1 detailed optimization molecular assignment and quality control for ft icr ms measurements are shown in the supporting information the assigned molecular formulas were classified into condensed aromatic structures cas aimod 0 67 aromatic structures as 0 5 aimod 0 67 highly unsaturated structures with low oxygen huslo aimod 0 5 h c 1 5 o c 0 5 highly unsaturated structures with high oxygen husho aimod 0 5 h c 1 5 0 5 o c 0 9 aliphatics 1 5 h c 2 o c 0 9 n 0 peptides 1 5 h c 2 o c 0 9 n 0 and sugars o c 0 9 he et al 2016 the intensity weighted double bond equivalent dbe dbe o c modified aromaticity index aimod and normal oxidation state of carbon nosc were calculated using nmc matlab package supporting information lv et al 2016 liu et al 2020 2 4 generalized and hetero 2d cos analyses for psdom formation generalized and hetero 2d cos analyses were performed to explore the sequential changes and associations of pdom molecules and mpps functional groups with increasing irradiation time 2d cos signal variations and correlations are well interpreted according to noda s rules supporting information noda and ozaki 2009 chen et al 2015 the van krevelen diagram of molecules in each psdom was divided into two separate diagrams the first diagram had the h c ratio as the x axis ranging from 0 30 to 2 15 with increment of 0 01 and the second diagram had the o c ratio as the x axis ranging from 0 10 to 1 33 with increment of 0 01 the number and nosc of molecules at each h c and o c increment as the y axis generalized and hetero 2d cos were performed between 1 the h c and o c diagrams of psdom molecules 2 the ftir absorbance of photoaged mpps and 3 the relative intensity nosc of ft icr ms molecules of psdom and the ftir absorbance of photoaged mpps statistical analyses are shown in the supporting information 2 5 method limitations and data reliability analyses considering the spe extraction and ionization efficiency the unextracted and macromolecular compounds 1000 da in psdom were hard to detect by ft icr ms d andrilli et al 2020 therefore the detected psdom compounds represent only a fraction of the overall pool several important processes were conducted to solve the limitations of used methods to the maximum extent a standardized data processing routine e g dreem and reliable open database e g openfluor org for fluorescence analysis were applied to strengthen model interpretation and result comparison reducing ambiguous labeling and number misestimating of components rosario ortiz and korak 2017 eem ftir spectra of psdom after spe treatment were measured to establish their correlations with mass datasets ensuring as much as possible that the target components analyzed by different methods were the same the targeted and hypothesis driven data with clear expectation were interpreted to avoid perfunctory misidentified correlations between spectroscopy and mass datasets the essential analyses of data acquisition mass patterns and intentional assessments for complementary information were conducted to help produce sound interpretation of psdom formation mechanism the low standard deviation sd of doc and normalized eem peak intensity of psdom between replicates indicated the reliability of the data table s1 the average doc under uv irradiation was 203 40 11 84 mg l thus the sd divided by the average value was small below 5 8 the average normalized intensity of peak p peak h and peak l was 0 32 0 02 5 05 0 27 and 3 17 0 23 r u respectively and the low sd indicated the reliability of fluorescence data the reliability of ft icr ms measurement was evaluated before use based on the evaluation of molecular parameter of srfa as reported by he et al 2020 the provided relative sd of repeatability and reproducibility had a range of 1 4 based on the h c value formulae number and peak intensity from repeat measurements ft icr ms and fluorescence measurements of psdom were conducted in one time avoiding the variability caused by different measurement times the measurement and analysis of psdom datasets were conducted according to the standardized processes to ensure the reliability of data results 3 results and discussion 3 1 leaching and fluorescence properties of psdom the particle size of mpps was less than 200 μm and the surface morphology was irregular blocks with granular debris attached figure s1 diverse mpps functional groups were distinguished using ftir x ray photoelectron spectroscopy such as aliphatic carbonyl aromatic groups supporting information figure s2 the average dissolved organic carbon doc of psdom increased from 8 08 to 80 04 mg l g ps with increasing irradiation time exhibiting positive and statistically significant linear correlations under uv light r 0 992 p 0 001 and under dark condition r 0 814 p 0 014 figure s3 therefore the photodegradation of mpps was a non negligible source of dom peak p 310 265 nm appeared in the protein phenol like region of dark uv treated psdom while peaks h l 410 295 and 410 240 nm only appeared in the humic like region of uv treated psdom spagnuolo et al 2017 figures s4 s5 peaks h l of srdom showed longer em and ex wavelengths than those of psdom thus the peak h l ratio could effectively distinguish mpdom from adom figure s6 as the irradiation time increased eem signals of srdom disappeared obviously indicating that most of the fluorescent components were photodegraded this phenomenon was consistent with the apparent loss of fluorescence of psdom after one more day s irradiation where only the protein phenol like components showed weak signals under 3 5 day s irradiation figure s7 therefore the remaining fluorescent components after one more day s irradiation had little contribution to the fluorescence of filtered psdom in the next stage in contrast the photoaging of mpps functional groups still produced abundant fluorescent components figure s4 therefore fluorescent components formed in each stage were related to the photodegradation of mpps and psdom while the contribution of the former was far greater than that of the latter parafac components of psdom fem maxima included f 348 f 406 and f 426 before spe treatment and f 392 f 408 and f 440 after spe treatment fig 1 a b s8 s9 f 392 f 406 f 408 f 426 corresponded to humic like components f 348 was associated with protein phenol like components which did not observe in psdom after spe treatment therefore spe treatment changed the fluorescence properties of psdom especially for components with strong biolabile properties which was related to the extraction efficiency and selective adsorption of spe ppl conformation changes or charge transfer of psdom during spe treatment could also result in loss of fluorescence the intensities of parafac components varied with increasing irradiation time indicating simultaneous photolytic degradation and formation of fluorescent components 3 2 psdom molecular diversity and its association with fluorescent components 3 2 1 molecular diversity and chemical properties the average molecular weight mw w 402 95 da o c w 0 43 dbe w 6 80 aimod w 0 16 and nosc w 0 55 of psdom were lower than the average mw w 417 49 da o c w 0 56 dbe w 11 04 aimod w 0 43 and nosc w 0 21 of adom table s2 therefore psdom contained more relatively low molecular weight saturated and low aromatic molecules than adom cho molecules were dominant in psdom with number percentages of 64 27 80 69 comparable to those 73 05 85 45 in adom several additives with complex molecular structures and physiochemical properties were presented in mps such as the plasticizers flame retardants antioxidants and light stabilizers for example some nitrogen containing additives including the complexes of 2 thioacitic acid benzothiazol and the uv absorbers of 2 2 hydroxy 5 methylphenyl benzotriazole and bis 2 2 6 6 tetramethyl 4 piperidyl sebacate have been found in mpps although the nitrogen containing additives were present in small quantities in mpps they could undergo the degradation reactions of molecular bond breaking or chemical phototransformation during mpps photoaging contributing to the formation of chon molecules shakeri yekta et al 2012 as the irradiation time increased to the fourth day the h cw value of psdom increased to a maximum value of 1 50 while the o cw dbew and aimodw values showed minimum values of 0 40 6 22 and 0 12 respectively table s2 subsequently the o cw dbew and aimodw values increased to the maximum on the seventh day therefore psdom molecules with the highest saturation were formed in the middle stage of mpps photoaging while more oxidized unsaturated aromatic molecules could be formed under long term irradiation moreover the negative dbe o c w and noscw values indicated the formation of more reduced molecules which was most noticeable on the second and fourth day of irradiation for comparison the number of srdom molecules decreased from 7314 to 292 with increasing irradiation time indicating that significant photodegradation occurred fig 1c in contrast continuous mpps degradation significantly promoted the formation of abundant molecules as the mw w o c w ai modw and nosc w of srdom decreased a small number of highly saturated molecules formed indicating the transition of some oxidized high weight molecules to saturated low weight molecules the huslo 30 54 39 46 and husho 13 94 28 66 percentages of psdom were higher and lower than the huslo 18 03 25 24 and husho 29 90 41 40 percentages of adom respectively fig 2 a s10 s11 table s3 therefore psdom contained less highly oxidized condensed structures than adom the percentages of aliphatic peptide molecules in psdom 10 54 24 44 were considerably greater than those in adom 1 76 3 24 which suggested that psdom contained more protein like molecules that were believed to undergo rapid phototransformation compared to adom romera castillo et al 2018 furthermore the fluctuating percentage changes in psdom molecules with increasing irradiation time might be related to the synergistic reactions of molecular formation and photodegradation or the chemical transformation between molecules bittar et al 2015 for example husho molecules containing carboxy rich alicyclic acids increased considerably at 1 3 d and 5 8 d which may be related to the decomposition of polymers via photochemical cleavage or the norrish reaction in the dbe o c vs nosc plots 46 83 62 66 of psdom molecules possessed negative dbe o c and nosc values indicating the formation of more saturated reduced molecules fig 2b s12 s13 table s4 the majority of psdom molecules 69 46 86 72 and adom molecules 69 04 73 54 exhibited mostly reduced and oxidized properties respectively moreover the proportion of unsaturated reduced molecules in psdom overall increased as irradiation time increased table s4 which implied that psdom molecules with double bonds and activated aromatic rings showed progressively increasing contribution zhang et al 2021a the increase decrease in the percentage of saturated reduced molecules in psdom was accompanied by a decrease increase in the percentage of unsaturated saturated oxidized molecules with increasing irradiation time which suggested the photochemical conversion between reduced and oxidized molecules 3 2 2 unique molecules and relationships between common molecules and fluorescents unique molecules were detected only in a specific psdom and more unique molecules 119 322 were observed on the fourth and seventh days compared to other days 15 64 fig 2c s14a which could be due to the degradation mutations of more mpps structures or the enhanced intermolecular phototransformation 60 49 of unique psdom molecules were mainly concentrated in the nosc 0 region fig 2c s14b which indicated that the newly formed molecules exhibited predominantly strong reduction properties the unique molecules located in the nosc 0 region were mainly in psdom7 and belonged to the tannin like cas husho molecules with high oxidation degrees some unique molecules with high nosc values were mostly found in psdom formed at irradiation times 4 d fig 2d indicating that more new oxidized molecules were formed during prolonged irradiation the formation of unique molecules was dynamic due to the simultaneous photodegradation of mpps and psdom the one more day s irradiation of filtered psdom showed that most of the molecules disappeared and a small number of new molecules formed fig 1d s15 the newly formed molecules showed unique properties among different psdoms as did the degradation of molecules within one day s period indicating that psdom photodegradation could be the source of a small number of unique molecules specifically after one more day s irradiation the average m z values of psdom molecules decreased from 397 49 406 59 to 282 77 361 12 and the stronger reduction occurred at the beginning of photoaging which contributed to the formation of more saturated unique molecules around m z 300 figure s16 the density distribution of molecules along increasing m z value showed that more molecules with m z 400 and m z 400 were observed in psdom before and after one more day s irradiation respectively fig 2e therefore the chemical conversion of high mass molecules to low mass molecules exhibited during psdom photoaging which might promote the formation of unique low molecular weight molecules furthermore the unique molecules produced by mpps and psdom photodegradation were quite different fig 2f s14a which indicated that mpps photodegradation significantly altered the number and types of unique molecules therefore unique molecules at each stage were formed by the photoaging of mpps and psdom but the contribution of mpps photodegradation to unique molecule formation was much higher than that of psdom photodegradation common molecules were all detected in all filtered psdom and the common carboxyl rich alicyclic acids and huslo molecules were dominant with contribution of 42 88 38 85 supporting information figures s17 s18 for psdom before spe treatment highly unsaturated phenolic molecules exhibited positive correlations with f 348 f 406 and husho molecules h c 1 5 o c 0 5 contributed more to f 406 than to f 348 figure s19 the humic like f 406 showed negative correlations with aliphatic peptide molecules therefore humic like components were more shifted towards common aromatic oxygen rich molecules for psdom after spe treatment fluorescents showed obvious weak correlations with common aliphatic peptide molecules figure s20 this was due to the less adsorption of saturated components by ppl sorbent huslo and husho showed more positive and negative correlations with fluorescents especially f 392 and f 440 respectively and the correlations between husho and fluorescents became stronger after spe treatment f 440 also showed stronger correlations with common molecules than f 408 indicating that humic like components with long wavelengths might be related to photoresistant molecules fu et al 2016 3 3 heterogeneous correlations and dynamic leaching responses of psdom molecules 3 3 1 leaching responses of psdom molecules based on 2d ft icr ms cos two positive regions v1 v2 at h c 0 5 1 5 0 5 1 5 and 1 55 2 0 1 55 2 0 and one negative region at h c 1 55 2 0 0 6 1 5 were observed in the number dependent synchronous map fig 3 a which showed that most of molecules across a broad h c range had the same trend of number change the nosc dependent synchronous signs of psdom molecules showed that the nosc changes were more complicated than the number changes such as their opposite signs at h c 1 1 2 0 0 5 1 0 fig 3a therefore the changes in the number and nosc of psdom molecules were inconsistent for example the formation of many new molecules with low nosc or the photodegradation of few molecules with high nosc could cause the opposite changes in the molecular number and nosc the number of molecules with o c 0 4 0 9 had negative synchronous crosscorrelations with those at o c 0 1 0 35 fig 3b which indicated that the number of molecules with different oxidation degrees evolved in different trends as irradiation time increased the broad distribution of positive nosc dependent synchronous signs indicated the same nosc trend among molecules except for molecules with o c 0 4 0 5 fig 3b the higher number dependent and nosc dependent synchronous intensities were observed at o c 0 4 0 9 and o c 0 1 0 35 respectively which suggested that molecules with low and high oxidation had more significant changes in nosc and number respectively even though the van krevelen diagrams of psdom had molecular formulas falling in the o c 0 9 region this region showed less significant synchronous correlations based on o c diagrams fig 3b therefore psdom molecules in this region might be dynamically stable likely being either molecules that resisted photodegradation or molecules with a rate of reduction similar to that of supply the sign distribution of asynchronous crosscorrelations based on the h c diagrams indicated that the dynamic evolution of psdom molecules was very complex especially at h c 0 5 1 5 0 5 1 5 and h c 1 55 2 0 1 55 2 0 fig 3a the negative number nosc dependent asynchronous correlations were dominant at h c 1 55 2 0 1 2 1 7 while number dependent and nosc dependent asynchronous correlations showed dominant positive and negative signs at h c 1 55 2 0 0 6 0 95 respectively according to noda s rules the sequential response of number nosc of unsaturated molecules h c 0 6 0 95 to increasing irradiation time preceded those of saturated molecules h c 1 2 2 0 furthermore in the asynchronous distribution based on o c diagrams positive correlations at approximately o c 0 4 0 8 0 1 0 35 were dominant for the number dependent crosspeaks while positive correlations at 0 4 0 55 and negative correlations at 0 6 0 8 were observed for nosc dependent crosspeaks fig 3b therefore the nosc of low oxidized molecules o c 0 1 0 35 had prioritized response to increasing irradiation time than that of high oxidized molecules o c 0 4 0 8 the combined asynchronous conclusions above indicated that oxidized psdom molecules were active and preferentially formed during mpps photoaging four regions with o c versus h c at approximately 0 15 0 35 0 45 1 4 1 5 2 0 and 0 4 0 9 0 45 1 4 1 5 2 0 were observed in the number nosc dependent heterosynchronous maps which were mainly associated with huslo husho lipid and aliphatic peptide molecules fig 3c husho and lipid molecules had stronger positive intensities than other molecules in the number dependent and nosc dependent heterosynchronous maps respectively therefore the number of husho molecules and the nosc of lipid molecules changed more obviously as irradiation time increased moreover the number changes of lipid and husho molecules showed different trends with increasing irradiation time which was opposite to the same trend of number changes of aliphatic peptide and huslo molecules the nosc of molecules belonging to the same molecular class except for huslo had almost the same trend of changes furthermore the sequential irradiation responses of thousands of psdom molecules were very complex as shown by the complex heteroasynchronous sign distribution figure s21 for example the dominant negative heteroasynchronous region for lipid class implied that the irradiation responses of number nosc of high saturated molecules h c 1 5 2 0 preceded those of low oxidized molecules o c 0 15 0 35 3 3 2 nosc leaching responses of individual psdom molecules in the examining regions at m z 200 350 350 500 500 650 and 650 800 fig 4 the negative and positive crosscorrelations were dominant within m z 200 650 and m z 650 800 respectively and the highest blue shades within m z 350 500 indicated the intense correlations therefore the relatively low weight molecules of psdom showed more diversity in their nosc reactivity than relatively high weight molecules the crosscorrelations between psdom molecules falling in m z 425 036 425 197 versus those over the entire m z range were further plotted at high resolution fig 3d molecular formulas of c19h22o11 c20h26o10 and c25h30o6 falling in lignin like region showed similar correlation patterns along the entire m z range which behaved completely different from c17h14o13 and c21h14o10 falling in tannin like and condensed aromatic region respectively in the asynchronous hetrocorrelation versus m z plots c10h13o5 c17h29o5 c19h25o9 c20h25o10 c27h29o11 c28h35o14 c36h49o13 and c40h59o12 with high heterocorrelation intensities exhibited large variance in positive negative distribution and intensity fig 4c the heterocorrelation intensity of individual molecules decreased as molecular mass increased such as a hundred times stronger of c10h13o5 c17h29o5 intensities than c36h49o13 c40h59o12 intensities therefore the cooperative nosc changes between low molecular weight molecules were more obvious moreover the mostly opposite crosscorrelation signals between heterosynchronous and heteroasynchronous maps indicated that the nosc change responses of relatively high weight molecules preceded those of relatively low weight molecules fig 4a b the intensities and number percentages of positive and negative heterocorrelations between individual molecules showed more subtle differences in nosc responses for c10h13o5 c17h29o5 m z 350 c36h49o13 c40h59o12 m z 650 and c19h25o9 c28h35o14 m z 350 650 the number percentages of positive heterocorrelations 39 5 47 6 were lower than those of negative heterocorreations 52 4 60 5 fig 4c therefore the nosc changes of these individual molecules showed broad association differences with those of more than half of remaining individual molecules 3 4 evolution of psdom and mpps functional groups and their associations with molecules 3 4 1 evolution associations between psdom functional groups and molecules ftir spectra of psdom before and after spe treatment were different which suggested that spe treatment selectively adsorbed specific components such as carboxylic acids and phenols figure s22 ftir spectra of psdom before and after one more day s irradiation showed that absorption peak almost disappeared after more irradiation accompanied by the appearance of a small number of weak absorption peaks figure s23 therefore most of the functional groups of psdom were photodegraded after one more day s irradiation which was consistent with the change of fluorescence features the remaining functional groups might arise from photostable or newly formed components therefore the large psdom components with different functional groups showed obvious degradation while the photodegradation products with few functional groups might contribute slightly to the molecular formation in the latter irradiation stage four primary functional groups were identified from the obvious ftir features at 1800 800 cm 1 of psdom after spe treatment including aromatic c h phenolic aliphatic c h and carboxylic groups fig 5 a the evolution associations between molecules and four functional groups were explored using 2d cos synchronous heterocorrelations between normalized ft icr ms intensity and ftir absorbance the aromatic c h and carboxylic groups showed weaker and stronger correlations with molecules respectively positive correlations indicated the same evolution feature while negative correlations strongly correlate with the coexistence of degradation and formation of psdom components huslo 33 1 33 9 husho 20 4 1 6 aliphatics 18 2 21 8 and peptides 11 4 15 8 showed high number percentages of positive negative heterocorrelations fig 5b s24 suggesting their significant formation or photodegradation properties in conjunction with the main functional groups the inconsistent trends between psdom functional groups and molecules with increasing irradiation time were explored using negative heterocorrelations which most likely involved the photodegradation of high weight molecules with different functional groups to generate low weight molecules this was supported by the reduction in molecular weight and functional groups of psdom after one more day s irradiation mostly opposite heterosynchronous and heteroasynchronous signals also supported photodegradation of functional groups prior to molecular changes figure s25 the density distribution of functional groups showed that various inconsistent changes were mainly observed in relatively low weight psdom molecules m z 450 especially cas sugars which were closely related to the photodegradation of macromolecules fig 6 a d moreover in the relatively low molecular weight range m z 450 psdom molecules with carboxylic groups and aliphatic c h phenolic aromatic c h groups mainly contributed to the inconsistent changes degradation vs formation of husho and sugars huslo respectively in the relatively high molecular weight range 450 m z 800 huslo showed more obvious opposite trends with major functional groups therefore the mass changes of different molecular components during psdom photoaging were likely related to the photodegradation of different functional groups 3 4 2 photoaged evolution of mpps functional groups the obvious ftir features of photoaged mpps were mainly observed at 1800 800 cm 1 which were related to various functional groups such as oxidized groups monomer carboxylates in additives and carbonyl groups fig 3e s26 table s5 the degree of change in peak intensity varied with irradiation time and the peaks with large changes were related to functional groups with high photoaging sensitivity in the 2d ftir cos maps of mpps functional groups several distinctive synchronous autopeaks were observed on the diagonal lines which showed that ch2 1450 cm 1 and aromatic ring 1490 1600 cm 1 groups had strong autocorrelations fig 3c the valid asynchronous crosspeaks of mpps revealed the sequential changes in functional groups in response to increasing photoaging time which were distinguished and summarized in table s6 specifically the positive regions at v1 v2 of 1700 1770 1012 1083 1296 1608 cm 1 with centers of 1600 1495 1450 1360 and 1030 cm 1 several positive slender strips at 1450 1495 1690 800 1000 1450 1600 cm 1 and one negative slender strip at 1296 1600 1030 cm 1 were observed in the asynchronous map fig 3c table s6 the combined synchronous asynchronous signs and distribution showed that the primary sequential photoaging response of ftir peaks of mpps followed as 1012 1083 1700 1770 1450 1495 1600 1280 1450 800 1000 cm 1 according to the ftir peak assignments the primary sequential photoaging response of mpps functional groups had an order of aromatic c h bend carbonyl groups aromatic ring stretch ch2 bend c h bond stretch groups this result implied that the photodegradation of unsaturated aromatic structures of mpps was favored over the photodegradation of saturated structures which was consistent with the preferential formation of unsaturated oxidized psdom molecules 3 4 3 associations between photoaged mpps functional groups and psdom molecules the primary ftir wavenumber locations showed more significant heterocorrelations with the molecular m z in the 2d ftir ft icr ms cos map which suggested that the dominant mpps functional groups were more associated with the formation of psdom molecules fig 5c d the positive heterocorrelations were more pronounced than the negative heterocorrelations showing the good synergy and consistency for the changes of mpps groups and psdom molecules the distribution of heterocorrelation intensities showed that psdom molecules with m z 450 800 had higher heterocorrelations with mpps functional groups than molecules with m z 200 450 fig 5c therefore mpps functional groups had stronger change associations with the relatively high molecular weight psdom molecules 450 m z 800 while the relatively low molecular weight molecules m z 450 could arise from the photodegradation or transformation of mpps functional groups as indicated by the increased blue signs the negative heterocorrelations could suggest that the photodegradation of mpps functional groups contributed the formation of psdom molecules the number percentages of negative heterocorrelations of huslo 34 1 husho 21 1 aliphatics 20 6 and peptides 14 2 among correlated psdom molecules were much higher than those of other molecular classes 0 7 6 1 fig 5d therefore the huslo husho aliphatics peptides variations showed more pronounced correlations with the changes of major mpps functional groups moreover the density distribution of mpps functional groups along correlated psdom molecular m z showed that c h bond aromatic c h groups had more diverse distributions than ch2 aromatic ring oxidized carbonyl groups fig 6e h s27 therefore the photodegradation of c h bond aromatic c h groups of mpps was more active which contributed more to the diversity of psdom molecules for example the photodegradation of aromatic c h oxidized groups played an important role in the formation of huslo husho e g c17h25o8 c16h21o8 and c18h23o7 and aliphatic molecules e g c16h25o6 c15h23o and c14h21o6 respectively figure s28 the molecules below m z 450 exhibited more diverse heterocorrelations suggesting that the relatively low molecular weight molecules m z 450 formed from a broad source of photodegradation of mpps functional groups fig 6e h s27 the relatively high molecular weight molecules 450 m z 800 formed from the photodegradation of major mpps functional groups mainly focused on the aliphatic peptide huslo husho molecules which showed wider m z ranges and higher heterocorrelation intensities than cas sugar as molecules fig 6e h s27 this result indicated that photodegradation of major mpps functional groups was more likely to directly form the relatively high molecular weight molecules 450 m z 800 the relatively low molecular weight molecules m z 450 could be formed by mpps photodegradation or by transformation of relatively high molecular weight molecules 450 m z 800 thereby reducing their heterocorrelation intensities 3 5 molecular level psdom formation mechanism from photodegradation of mpps functional groups based on the main outstanding contribution of mpps photodegradation to psdom formation the molecular level formation mechanism of psdom during mpps photoaging was innovatively proposed to interpret the evolution heterogeneity and sequential response of different molecular classes with increasing irradiation time fig 7 this molecular level mechanism showed that the photodegradation of different mpps functional groups significantly contributed to the formation of different psdom molecular classes implying synergistic relationships and irradiation phase characteristics between them the sequential response of psdom molecules to increasing irradiation time can be categorized into prioritized intermediate and later stages this is following a primary response order of low oxidized high weight molecules 450 m z 800 high oxidized molecules saturated low weight molecules m z 450 fig 7 the prioritized photodegradation responses of aromatic c h groups of mpps to increasing irradiation time contributed to the initial formation of low oxidized and high weight psdom molecules 450 m z 800 which was consistent with the highest huslo percentage fig 7 the chromophore groups like aromatics in mpps macromolecules acted as initiators responsible for triggering photochemical reactions such as the absorption of light quanta by benzene ring to form excited singlet state mpps wu et al 2022 the aromatic c h c c groups of mpps could be preferentially cleaved under sufficient irradiation energy induction resulting in the scission of mpps polymer backbone and the formation of relatively high weight psdom molecules this phenomenon was consistent with the reported low break energy of c c bonds 284 368 kj mol and c h bonds 380 410 kj mol during ps photodegradation wu et al 2022 the subsequent photodegradation reactions involving free radicals of specific mpps functional groups could cause a series of chain induction diffusion scission and termination resulting in the formation of low oxidized psdom molecules with hydroxyl carboxyl carbonyl groups yousif and haddad 2013 zhu et al 2020 for example the preferential breaks of aromatic c h bonds of mpps could react with oxygen to generate c o thereby further oxidizing to unsaturated molecules e g aldehydes ketones ethers with carbonyl and phenolic hydroxyl groups through free radical reactions occurred qiu et al 2022 the low oxidized psdom molecules formed in this stage showed diverse chemical properties and were more sensitive to the changing irradiation time causing their significant nosc changes the intermediate photodegradation responses of carbonyl and aromatic ring groups of mpps to increasing irradiation time were mainly related to the formation of high oxidized psdom molecules such as the second largest percentage of husho fig 7 the obvious reactions of carbonyl groups of mpps in this stage could be due to the dissociation and chain scission of polystyryl radicals formed by generating excited states during the initial photochemical reactions yousif and haddad 2013 zhang et al 2021b the apparent responses of carbonyl groups of mpps to increasing irradiation time indicated the occurrence of oxidation reactions with chain scission leading to the formation of psdom molecules with high oxidation degree wu et al 2022 moreover the apparent reactions of aromatic ring groups of mpps provided direct support for the reactions involving ring structure induced by uv irradiation zhang et al 2000 the oxygen uptake by the ring and the increased symmetry of chromophore by attaching functional groups at the para position of ring provided the possibility for the conversion reaction from aromatic vibration of mpps to dissolved oxygen containing species zhang et al 2000 for example when the benzene ring with free radicals was close to the hydroxyl radicals new phenol like molecules in psdom were easily formed through cross linking during the fragmentation of phenyl centers overall the fragmentation oxidation free radical reactions during mpps photoaging were more pronounced which resulted in more significant changes in the number of high oxidized psdom molecules such as the transformation from reduced molecules to oxidized molecules through the enhanced reactions of polystyryl peroxy radicals with oxygen yousif and haddad 2013 the later photodegradation responses of ch2 c h groups of mpps to increasing irradiation time mainly contributed to the later formation of saturated and low weight psdom molecules m z 450 especially aliphatic peptide molecules fig 7 after the photochemical reactions of aromatic rings of mpps the excitation energy could be transferred to the h atom in the nearest c h ch2 bond through the intramolecular resulting in the cleavage of hydrogen and the formation of saturated psdom molecules such as aliphatic molecules with alkyl groups wu et al 2022 yousif and haddad 2013 therefore the saturation of mpps functional groups in this later photodegradation stage played a major role in the secondary reactions such as chain scission intramolecular breakdown reactions ainali et al 2021 resulting in a broad formation source of psdom molecules moreover the apparent generation of saturated psdom molecules was an important reason for the strong sensitivity of their nosc property to increasing irradiation time the large changes in molecular weights of psdom could be related to the intramolecular hydrogen transfer followed by the mid chain carbon bond scission and random scission during photodegradation of mpps ainali et al 2021 the dynamic formation of molecules could also involve a partial conversion from high weight molecules with different functional groups to low weight molecules during photoaging of psdom itself but this was much smaller than the contribution of mpps photodegradation to low weight molecules the photodegradation of psdom with aromatic aliphatic c h phenolic carboxylic groups mainly contributed to the huslo husho aliphatics peptides formation which was more pronounced for low molecular weight molecules m z 450 the psdom molecules formed in the previous stage of irradiation especially easily photodegradable molecules formed in the early stage of photoaging were almost photodegraded after one more day s irradiation which was supported by the dramatic disappearance of features of fluorescent components and functional groups therefore a small amount of photodegradation products produced by psdom itself had little effect on the formation characteristics of filtered psdom in the next irradiation stage which also highlighted the dominant role of mpps photoaging on the molecular formation we demonstrated the significant difference in photoaging between mpps and psdom using the information comparison which was crucial for understanding the dynamic formation mechanism of psdom molecules given that mpps and psdom were photodegraded simultaneously in the same aging system how to separate and quantify their specific contributions to different molecules still needs to be further explored 4 conclusions the powerful 2d ft icr ms ftir cos application helps establish a novel molecular level psdom formation mechanism for the first time demonstrating the heterogeneity dynamic evolution and sequential irradiation response of psdom molecules during mpps photoaging photochemical transformations occurred between saturated reduced and oxidized molecules during psdom leaching the photodegradation of mpps functional groups showed higher contribution to the huslo husho aliphatics peptides variations and to the formation of psdom molecules with m z 450 800 than molecules with m z 200 450 the photodegradation of c h bond and aromatic c h bend groups of mpps was more active which contributed more to the diversity of psdom molecules moreover the primary sequential response of psdom molecules to increasing irradiation time low oxidized high weight 450 m z 800 high oxidized saturated low weight molecules m z 450 corresponded to the response of mpps functional groups aromatic c h carbonyl aromatic ring ch2 bend c h groups showing well synergistic relationships between them these novel findings will contribute to the understanding of formation transformation and underappreciated behaviors of mpdom in aquatic ecosystems

14656,microplastics mps and their derivatives have received worldwide attention owing to their adverse effects on ecosystems however molecular diversity and dynamic formation of dissolved organic matter dom during the photoaging of mps remain unclear herein we explored a molecular level formation mechanism for polystyrene mp mpps derived dom psdom during the photoaging of mps to explain the evolution heterogeneity and sequential response of molecules to irradiation two dimensional correlation spectroscopy was applied to correlate the variations of psdom molecules detected by fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry with those of mpps functional groups detected by fourier transform infrared spectroscopy irradiation induced psdom contained the most highly unsaturated structures with oxygen but showed fewer aromatic structures than natural aquatic dom photochemical transformations occurred between saturated reduced and oxidized molecules during psdom leaching with the low oxidized and high oxidized molecules undergoing considerable changes in the normal carbon oxidation state and molecular number respectively the primary sequential response of psdom molecules to increasing irradiation time low oxidized high weight 450 m z 800 high oxidized saturated low weight molecules m z 450 corresponded to the response of mpps functional groups aromatic c h carbonyl aromatic ring ch2 bend c h groups demonstrating well synergistic relationships between them these novel findings will contribute to the understanding of underappreciated behaviors or risks of mpdom in aquatic ecosystems graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords molecular parameters fluorescence properties unique molecules heterogeneous correlations leaching responses dynamic formation data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction microplastics mps with size 5 mm have attracted worldwide attention with a major concern for ecological health sun et al 2022 high concentration of mps has been found in aquatic ecosystems as water networks collect plastics from extensive anthropogenic sources bai et al 2022 he et al 2023 mai et al 2019 reported that the annual riverine input of mps in the pearl river delta china was 2400 3800 tons of plastic debris mps is carbon based chain structures and the chemical modification of mps induced by aging processes causes severe damage to these structures releasing substantial quantities of dissolved organic matter mpdom into waters disrupting the existing carbon cycle lee et al 2022 ren et al 2022 however despite mpdom is becoming more prevalent in aquatic ecosystems little is known about its leaching properties and molecular diversity a comprehensive understanding of the complex molecular composition of mpdom and its dynamic formation is necessary to accurately predict the emerging risks of mps in aquatic ecosystems uv irradiation is a strong driving force for the production of mpdom from mps photoaging the humic like components in mpdom are much visible under uv irradiation and the protein phenol like components can serve as good fluorescent representations for dom from bisphenol a containing mps lee et al 2020 therefore identifying the fluorescent and molecular compounds in irradiation derived mpdom is essential as they control their fate in aquatic ecosystems the excitation emission matrix parallel factor analysis eem parafac and fourier transform infrared spectrometry ftir have been applied to track the spectral signatures of irradiation derived mpdom from mineral adsorption lee and hur 2020 chlorine disinfection lee et al 2020 and copper interaction lee et al 2021 however few efforts have been made to explore the molecular composition and transformation of irradiation derived mpdom using high resolution mass spectrometry fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry ft icr ms with unparalleled mass resolving power has been developed to provide valuable molecular information of natural dom chen et al 2022 the joint analysis of spectral and ft icr ms datasets will help understand the molecular complexity of mpdom however the complementary information linking the molecular composition and spectroscopic parameters of mpdom is still highly required the leaching behavior of mpdom depends on the photodegradation conditions which makes remarkable diversity of molecules however the molecular level interrelationships in the changes between mpdom formation and mps degradation during irradiation remain unanswered owing to the lack of methods to link heterogeneous datasets on mpdom molecules and mps functional groups to overcome this issue two dimensional correlation spectroscopy 2d cos can improve the spectral resolution along two dimensions and establish the relationships between different probe signals song et al 2023 2d cos has advantages in revealing the sequential order of dynamic spectral variables in response to external perturbations huang et al 2012 abdulla et al 2013 joint 2d cos analysis of heterogeneous spectrum and mass datasets e g ft icr ms vs ftir is believed to facilitate a comprehensive understanding of the dynamic characteristics and formation mechanism of mpdom during mps photoaging nevertheless this topic is rarely explored at the molecular level we hypothesize that there are diversity heterogeneity and sequential responses of mpdom molecules with increasing irradiation time which can be closely related to the stepwise photodegradation of mps functional groups such an explicit analysis of targeted datasets allows for a better mechanistic interpretation of irradiation induced mpdom formation herein the dynamic formation mechanism of psdom during the photoaging of polystyrene mp mpps with increasing irradiation time were elucidated using 2d cos combined with ft icr ms and spectroscopic techniques the objectives were to 1 characterize the molecular diversity of irradiation induced psdom and its association with fluorescent components 2 explore the heterogeneous correlations and dynamic leaching responses of individual psdom molecules to increasing irradiation time 3 evaluate the reaction heterogeneities sequential responses and interrelationships of psdom molecules with photoaged mpps functional groups and 4 try to propose a molecular level dynamic formation mechanism of psdom 2 materials and methods 2 1 psdom leaching experiments during mpps photoaging the leaching experiments of psdom during mpps photoaging were conducted in a photochemical reactor equipped with a 500 w mercury lamp and recycled cooling system 25 c 0 5 c in the dark and under uv light eight groups of 5 0 g plastic l 1 mpps were added to eight 1l sterilized glass bottles and then shaken at 250 rpm during the designated times of 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 and 8 d each batch of mpps mixing solutions was separately filtered through a 0 45 μm filter membrane to obtain psdom supernatants named filtered psdomx x day and photoaged mpps to guarantee the priority of psdom research a widely used 0 45 μm membrane was selected for separation to better reflect the original properties of psdom the pretreatments avoided mechanical damages to original size of mpps minimizing the formation of nanoplastics during mpps photoaging control experiments without mpps were conducted simultaneously as blanks the leaching experiment was performed in duplicate because the internal space design of photochemical reactor used allowed complete the duplicate photoaging experiments in the same batch at one time this one time duplicate experiment at the same time and in the same space can effectively reduce the deviation caused by the experiment frequency and ensure the consistency of operation and the validity of data under the same photoaging condition the filtered psdom from each day s irradiation were subjected to uv photoaging for one more day s irradiation to explore the degradation of psdom itself named photoaged psdomx 1 moreover aquatic dom adom of suwannee river dom srdom fulvic acid srfa and humic acid srha were purchased from ihss as a comparison of psdom 10 mgc l 1 srdom was selected for photoaging experiments in the same photochemical reactor under the same photoaging conditions as mpps after designated photoaging times of 2 5 and 8 d srdom solutions was filtered through a 0 45 μm filter membrane and stored for later measurement 2 2 spectroscopic measurements of psdom adom and photoaged mpps uv vis eem and ftir spectra of filtered psdom before and after solid phase extraction spe treatment photoaged psdom srdom and photoaged mpps were measured using a spectrophotometer fluorescence spectrometer and ftir spectrometer respectively detailed measurement preparation settings and spectral data preprocessing are shown in the supporting information murphy et al 2010 ohno 2002 lawaetz and stedmon 2009 eem ftir measurements of spe purified psdom were used to better compare with molecular properties and to reduce the influence of possible nanoplastics in solutions on spectroscopic measurements due to the size particularity of nanoplastics it is difficult to reduce the impact of possible nanoplastics to zero therefore it is still necessary to develop effective technologies taking into account both the removal of nanoplastics and the maintenance of original properties of psdom 2 3 ft icr ms measurements of psdom and adom a widely accepted spe treatment was conducted to purify psdom due to the highly representative sample characters in isolates liu et al 2023 standard procedures and appropriate extraction efficiency of spe treatment ensured proper quality control spe ppl cartridges were purified with 20 ml methanol and acidified ultrapure water the filtered psdom were adjusted to ph 2 and then injected into cartridges the cartridges was washed with 20 ml acidified ultrapure water and dried with n2 flow the adsorbed psdom was eluted out from the cartridges with 10 ml methanol moreover part of psdom extracts were dried under n2 and dissolved in ultrapure water for doc and spectroscopic measurements extraction efficiency was calculated as the doc in methanol extract divided by doc in the corresponding psdom the previously determined mean doc extraction efficiency 60 of used spe ppl was consistent with those reported by dittmar et al 2008 although spe treatment may selectively adsorbed organic compounds in psdom it is an essential pretreatment for ft icr ms analysis providing rich and comparable molecular information ft icr ms measurements of psdom and adom were conducted using an ultra apex ft icr mass spectrometer bruker daltonics bremen germany with a 9 4 t superconducting magnet interfaced with negative ion electrospray ionization the purified psdom adom 50 mg l 1 was injected into an electrospray source at 250 μl h 1 detailed optimization molecular assignment and quality control for ft icr ms measurements are shown in the supporting information the assigned molecular formulas were classified into condensed aromatic structures cas aimod 0 67

oxidation state of carbon nosc were calculated using nmc matlab package supporting information lv et al 2016 liu et al 2020 2 4 generalized and hetero 2d cos analyses for psdom formation generalized and hetero 2d cos analyses were performed to explore the sequential changes and associations of pdom molecules and mpps functional groups with increasing irradiation time 2d cos signal variations and correlations are well interpreted according to noda s rules supporting information noda and ozaki 2009 chen et al 2015 the van krevelen diagram of molecules in each psdom was divided into two separate diagrams the first diagram had the h c ratio as the x axis ranging from 0 30 to 2 15 with increment of 0 01 and the second diagram had the o c ratio as the x axis ranging from 0 10 to 1 33 with increment of 0 01 the number and nosc of molecules at each h c and o c increment as the y axis generalized and hetero 2d cos were performed between 1 the h c and o c diagrams of psdom molecules 2 the ftir absorbance of photoaged mpps and 3 the relative intensity nosc of ft icr ms molecules of psdom and the ftir absorbance of photoaged mpps statistical analyses are shown in the supporting information 2 5 method limitations and data reliability analyses considering the spe extraction and ionization efficiency the unextracted and macromolecular compounds 1000 da in psdom were hard to detect by ft icr ms d andrilli et al 2020 therefore the detected psdom compounds represent only a fraction of the overall pool several important processes were conducted to solve the limitations of used methods to the maximum extent a standardized data processing routine e g dreem and reliable open database e g openfluor org for fluorescence analysis were applied to strengthen model interpretation and result comparison reducing ambiguous labeling and number misestimating of components rosario ortiz and korak 2017 eem ftir spectra of psdom after spe treatment were measured to establish their correlations with mass datasets ensuring as much as possible that the target components analyzed by different methods were the same the targeted and hypothesis driven data with clear expectation were interpreted to avoid perfunctory misidentified correlations between spectroscopy and mass datasets the essential analyses of data acquisition mass patterns and intentional assessments for complementary information were conducted to help produce sound interpretation of psdom formation mechanism the low standard deviation sd of doc and normalized eem peak intensity of psdom between replicates indicated the reliability of the data table s1 the average doc under uv irradiation was 203 40 11 84 mg l thus the sd divided by the average value was small below 5 8 the average normalized intensity of peak p peak h and peak l was 0 32 0 02 5 05 0 27 and 3 17 0 23 r u respectively and the low sd indicated the reliability of fluorescence data the reliability of ft icr ms measurement was evaluated before use based on the evaluation of molecular parameter of srfa as reported by he et al 2020 the provided relative sd of repeatability and reproducibility had a range of 1 4 based on the h c value formulae number and peak intensity from repeat measurements ft icr ms and fluorescence measurements of psdom were conducted in one time avoiding the variability caused by different measurement times the measurement and analysis of psdom datasets were conducted according to the standardized processes to ensure the reliability of data results 3 results and discussion 3 1 leaching and fluorescence properties of psdom the particle size of mpps was less than 200 μm and the surface morphology was irregular blocks with granular debris attached figure s1 diverse mpps functional groups were distinguished using ftir x ray photoelectron spectroscopy such as aliphatic carbonyl aromatic groups supporting information figure s2 the average dissolved organic carbon doc of psdom increased from 8 08 to 80 04 mg l g ps with increasing irradiation time exhibiting positive and statistically significant linear correlations under uv light r 0 992 p 0 001 and under dark condition r 0 814 p 0 014 figure s3 therefore the photodegradation of mpps was a non negligible source of dom peak p 310 265 nm appeared in the protein phenol like region of dark uv treated psdom while peaks h l 410 295 and 410 240 nm only appeared in the humic like region of uv treated psdom spagnuolo et al 2017 figures s4 s5 peaks h l of srdom showed longer em and ex wavelengths than those of psdom thus the peak h l ratio could effectively distinguish mpdom from adom figure s6 as the irradiation time increased eem signals of srdom disappeared obviously indicating that most of the fluorescent components were photodegraded this phenomenon was consistent with the apparent loss of fluorescence of psdom after one more day s irradiation where only the protein phenol like components showed weak signals under 3 5 day s irradiation figure s7 therefore the remaining fluorescent components after one more day s irradiation had little contribution to the fluorescence of filtered psdom in the next stage in contrast the photoaging of mpps functional groups still produced abundant fluorescent components figure s4 therefore fluorescent components formed in each stage were related to the photodegradation of mpps and psdom while the contribution of the former was far greater than that of the latter parafac components of psdom fem maxima included f 348 f 406 and f 426 before spe treatment and f 392 f 408 and f 440 after spe treatment fig 1 a b s8 s9 f 392 f 406 f 408 f 426 corresponded to humic like components f 348 was associated with protein phenol like components which did not observe in psdom after spe treatment therefore spe treatment changed the fluorescence properties of psdom especially for components with strong biolabile properties which was related to the extraction efficiency and selective adsorption of spe ppl conformation changes or charge transfer of psdom during spe treatment could also result in loss of fluorescence the intensities of parafac components varied with increasing irradiation time indicating simultaneous photolytic degradation and formation of fluorescent components 3 2 psdom molecular diversity and its association with fluorescent components 3 2 1 molecular diversity and chemical properties the average molecular weight mw w 402 95 da o c w 0 43 dbe w 6 80 aimod w 0 16 and nosc w 0 55 of psdom were lower than the average mw w 417 49 da o c w 0 56 dbe w 11 04 aimod w 0 43 and nosc w 0 21 of adom table s2 therefore psdom contained more relatively low molecular weight saturated and low aromatic molecules than adom cho molecules were dominant in psdom with number percentages of 64 27 80 69 comparable to those 73 05 85 45 in adom several additives with complex molecular structures and physiochemical properties were presented in mps such as the plasticizers flame retardants antioxidants and light stabilizers for example some nitrogen containing additives including the complexes of 2 thioacitic acid benzothiazol and the uv absorbers of 2 2 hydroxy 5 methylphenyl benzotriazole and bis 2 2 6 6 tetramethyl 4 piperidyl sebacate have been found in mpps although the nitrogen containing additives were present in small quantities in mpps they could undergo the degradation reactions of molecular bond breaking or chemical phototransformation during mpps photoaging contributing to the formation of chon molecules shakeri yekta et al 2012 as the irradiation time increased to the fourth day the h cw value of psdom increased to a maximum value of 1 50 while the o cw dbew and aimodw values showed minimum values of 0 40 6 22 and 0 12 respectively table s2 subsequently the o cw dbew and aimodw values increased to the maximum on the seventh day therefore psdom molecules with the highest saturation were formed in the middle stage of mpps photoaging while more oxidized unsaturated aromatic molecules could be formed under long term irradiation moreover the negative dbe o c w and noscw values indicated the formation of more reduced molecules which was most noticeable on the second and fourth day of irradiation for comparison the number of srdom molecules decreased from 7314 to 292 with increasing irradiation time indicating that significant photodegradation occurred fig 1c in contrast continuous mpps degradation significantly promoted the formation of abundant molecules as the mw w o c w ai modw and nosc w of srdom decreased a small number of highly saturated molecules formed indicating the transition of some oxidized high weight molecules to saturated low weight molecules the huslo 30 54 39 46 and husho 13 94 28 66 percentages of psdom were higher and lower than the huslo 18 03 25 24 and husho 29 90 41 40 percentages of adom respectively fig 2 a s10 s11 table s3 therefore psdom contained less highly oxidized condensed structures than adom the percentages of aliphatic peptide molecules in psdom 10 54 24 44 were considerably greater than those in adom 1 76 3 24 which suggested that psdom contained more protein like molecules that were believed to undergo rapid phototransformation compared to adom romera castillo et al 2018 furthermore the fluctuating percentage changes in psdom molecules with increasing irradiation time might be related to the synergistic reactions of molecular formation and photodegradation or the chemical transformation between molecules bittar et al 2015 for example husho molecules containing carboxy rich alicyclic acids increased considerably at 1 3 d and 5 8 d which may be related to the decomposition of polymers via photochemical cleavage or the norrish reaction in the dbe o c vs nosc plots 46 83 62 66 of psdom molecules possessed negative dbe o c and nosc values indicating the formation of more saturated reduced molecules fig 2b s12 s13 table s4 the majority of psdom molecules 69 46 86 72 and adom molecules 69 04 73 54 exhibited mostly reduced and oxidized properties respectively moreover the proportion of unsaturated reduced molecules in psdom overall increased as irradiation time increased table s4 which implied that psdom molecules with double bonds and activated aromatic rings showed progressively increasing contribution zhang et al 2021a the increase decrease in the percentage of saturated reduced molecules in psdom was accompanied by a decrease increase in the percentage of unsaturated saturated oxidized molecules with increasing irradiation time which suggested the photochemical conversion between reduced and oxidized molecules 3 2 2 unique molecules and relationships between common molecules and fluorescents unique molecules were detected only in a specific psdom and more unique molecules 119 322 were observed on the fourth and seventh days compared to other days 15 64 fig 2c s14a which could be due to the degradation mutations of more mpps structures or the enhanced intermolecular phototransformation 60 49 of unique psdom molecules were mainly concentrated in the nosc 0 region fig 2c s14b which indicated that the newly formed molecules exhibited predominantly strong reduction properties the unique molecules located in the nosc 0 region were mainly in psdom7 and belonged to the tannin like cas husho molecules with high oxidation degrees some unique molecules with high nosc values were mostly found in psdom formed at irradiation times 4 d fig 2d indicating that more new oxidized molecules were formed during prolonged irradiation the formation of unique molecules was dynamic due to the simultaneous photodegradation of mpps and psdom the one more day s irradiation of filtered psdom showed that most of the molecules disappeared and a small number of new molecules formed fig 1d s15 the newly formed molecules showed unique properties among different psdoms as did the degradation of molecules within one day s period indicating that psdom photodegradation could be the source of a small number of unique molecules specifically after one more day s irradiation the average m z values of psdom molecules decreased from 397 49 406 59 to 282 77 361 12 and the stronger reduction occurred at the beginning of photoaging which contributed to the formation of more saturated unique molecules around m z 300 figure s16 the density distribution of molecules along increasing m z value showed that more molecules with m z 400 and m z 400 were observed in psdom before and after one more day s irradiation respectively fig 2e therefore the chemical conversion of high mass molecules to low mass molecules exhibited during psdom photoaging which might promote the formation of unique low molecular weight molecules furthermore the unique molecules produced by mpps and psdom photodegradation were quite different fig 2f s14a which indicated that mpps photodegradation significantly altered the number and types of unique molecules therefore unique molecules at each stage were formed by the photoaging of mpps and psdom but the contribution of mpps photodegradation to unique molecule formation was much higher than that of psdom photodegradation common molecules were all detected in all filtered psdom and the common carboxyl rich alicyclic acids and huslo molecules were dominant with contribution of 42 88 38 85 supporting information figures s17 s18 for psdom before spe treatment highly unsaturated phenolic molecules exhibited positive correlations with f 348 f 406 and husho molecules h c 1 5 o c 0 5 contributed more to f 406 than to f 348 figure s19 the humic like f 406 showed negative correlations with aliphatic peptide molecules therefore humic like components were more shifted towards common aromatic oxygen rich molecules for psdom after spe treatment fluorescents showed obvious weak correlations with common aliphatic peptide molecules figure s20 this was due to the less adsorption of saturated components by ppl sorbent huslo and husho showed more positive and negative correlations with fluorescents especially f 392 and f 440 respectively and the correlations between husho and fluorescents became stronger after spe treatment f 440 also showed stronger correlations with common molecules than f 408 indicating that humic like components with long wavelengths might be related to photoresistant molecules fu et al 2016 3 3 heterogeneous correlations and dynamic leaching responses of psdom molecules 3 3 1 leaching responses of psdom molecules based on 2d ft icr ms cos two positive regions v1 v2 at h c 0 5 1 5 0 5 1 5 and 1 55 2 0 1 55 2 0 and one negative region at h c 1 55 2 0 0 6 1 5 were observed in the number dependent synchronous map fig 3 a which showed that most of molecules across a broad h c range had the same trend of number change the nosc dependent synchronous signs of psdom molecules showed that the nosc changes were more complicated than the number changes such as their opposite signs at h c 1 1 2 0 0 5 1 0 fig 3a therefore the changes in the number and nosc of psdom molecules were inconsistent for example the formation of many new molecules with low nosc or the photodegradation of few molecules with high nosc could cause the opposite changes in the molecular number and nosc the number of molecules with o c 0 4 0 9 had negative synchronous crosscorrelations with those at o c 0 1 0 35 fig 3b which indicated that the number of molecules with different oxidation degrees evolved in different trends as irradiation time increased the broad distribution of positive nosc dependent synchronous signs indicated the same nosc trend among molecules except for molecules with o c 0 4 0 5 fig 3b the higher number dependent and nosc dependent synchronous intensities were observed at o c 0 4 0 9 and o c 0 1 0 35 respectively which suggested that molecules with low and high oxidation had more significant changes in nosc and number respectively even though the van krevelen diagrams of psdom had molecular formulas falling in the o c 0 9 region this region showed less significant synchronous correlations based on o c diagrams fig 3b therefore psdom molecules in this region might be dynamically stable likely being either molecules that resisted photodegradation or molecules with a rate of reduction similar to that of supply the sign distribution of asynchronous crosscorrelations based on the h c diagrams indicated that the dynamic evolution of psdom molecules was very complex especially at h c 0 5 1 5 0 5 1 5 and h c 1 55 2 0 1 55 2 0 fig 3a the negative number nosc dependent asynchronous correlations were dominant at h c 1 55 2 0 1 2 1 7 while number dependent and nosc dependent asynchronous correlations showed dominant positive and negative signs at h c 1 55 2 0 0 6 0 95 respectively according to noda s rules the sequential response of number nosc of unsaturated molecules h c 0 6 0 95 to increasing irradiation time preceded those of saturated molecules h c 1 2 2 0 furthermore in the asynchronous distribution based on o c diagrams positive correlations at approximately o c 0 4 0 8 0 1 0 35 were dominant for the number dependent crosspeaks while positive correlations at 0 4 0 55 and negative correlations at 0 6 0 8 were observed for nosc dependent crosspeaks fig 3b therefore the nosc of low oxidized molecules o c 0 1 0 35 had prioritized response to increasing irradiation time than that of high oxidized molecules o c 0 4 0 8 the combined asynchronous conclusions above indicated that oxidized psdom molecules were active and preferentially formed during mpps photoaging four regions with o c versus h c at approximately 0 15 0 35 0 45 1 4 1 5 2 0 and 0 4 0 9 0 45 1 4 1 5 2 0 were observed in the number nosc dependent heterosynchronous maps which were mainly associated with huslo husho lipid and aliphatic peptide molecules fig 3c husho and lipid molecules had stronger positive intensities than other molecules in the number dependent and nosc dependent heterosynchronous maps respectively therefore the number of husho molecules and the nosc of lipid molecules changed more obviously as irradiation time increased moreover the number changes of lipid and husho molecules showed different trends with increasing irradiation time which was opposite to the same trend of number changes of aliphatic peptide and huslo molecules the nosc of molecules belonging to the same molecular class except for huslo had almost the same trend of changes furthermore the sequential irradiation responses of thousands of psdom molecules were very complex as shown by the complex heteroasynchronous sign distribution figure s21 for example the dominant negative heteroasynchronous region for lipid class implied that the irradiation responses of number nosc of high saturated molecules h c 1 5 2 0 preceded those of low oxidized molecules o c 0 15 0 35 3 3 2 nosc leaching responses of individual psdom molecules in the examining regions at m z 200 350 350 500 500 650 and 650 800 fig 4 the negative and positive crosscorrelations were dominant within m z 200 650 and m z 650 800 respectively and the highest blue shades within m z 350 500 indicated the intense correlations therefore the relatively low weight molecules of psdom showed more diversity in their nosc reactivity than relatively high weight molecules the crosscorrelations between psdom molecules falling in m z 425 036 425 197 versus those over the entire m z range were further plotted at high resolution fig 3d molecular formulas of c19h22o11 c20h26o10 and c25h30o6 falling in lignin like region showed similar correlation patterns along the entire m z range which behaved completely different from c17h14o13 and c21h14o10 falling in tannin like and condensed aromatic region respectively in the asynchronous hetrocorrelation versus m z plots c10h13o5 c17h29o5 c19h25o9 c20h25o10 c27h29o11 c28h35o14 c36h49o13 and c40h59o12 with high heterocorrelation intensities exhibited large variance in positive negative distribution and intensity fig 4c the heterocorrelation intensity of individual molecules decreased as molecular mass increased such as a hundred times stronger of c10h13o5 c17h29o5 intensities than c36h49o13 c40h59o12 intensities therefore the cooperative nosc changes between low molecular weight molecules were more obvious moreover the mostly opposite crosscorrelation signals between heterosynchronous and heteroasynchronous maps indicated that the nosc change responses of relatively high weight molecules preceded those of relatively low weight molecules fig 4a b the intensities and number percentages of positive and negative heterocorrelations between individual molecules showed more subtle differences in nosc responses for c10h13o5 c17h29o5 m z 350 c36h49o13 c40h59o12 m z 650 and c19h25o9 c28h35o14 m z 350 650 the number percentages of positive heterocorrelations 39 5 47 6 were lower than those of negative heterocorreations 52 4 60 5 fig 4c therefore the nosc changes of these individual molecules showed broad association differences with those of more than half of remaining individual molecules 3 4 evolution of psdom and mpps functional groups and their associations with molecules 3 4 1 evolution associations between psdom functional groups and molecules ftir spectra of psdom before and after spe treatment were different which suggested that spe treatment selectively adsorbed specific components such as carboxylic acids and phenols figure s22 ftir spectra of psdom before and after one more day s irradiation showed that absorption peak almost disappeared after more irradiation accompanied by the appearance of a small number of weak absorption peaks figure s23 therefore most of the functional groups of psdom were photodegraded after one more day s irradiation which was consistent with the change of fluorescence features the remaining functional groups might arise from photostable or newly formed components therefore the large psdom components with different functional groups showed obvious degradation while the photodegradation products with few functional groups might contribute slightly to the molecular formation in the latter irradiation stage four primary functional groups were identified from the obvious ftir features at 1800 800 cm 1 of psdom after spe treatment including aromatic c h phenolic aliphatic c h and carboxylic groups fig 5 a the evolution associations between molecules and four functional groups were explored using 2d cos synchronous heterocorrelations between normalized ft icr ms intensity and ftir absorbance the aromatic c h and carboxylic groups showed weaker and stronger correlations with molecules respectively positive correlations indicated the same evolution feature while negative correlations strongly correlate with the coexistence of degradation and formation of psdom components huslo 33 1 33 9 husho 20 4 1 6 aliphatics 18 2 21 8 and peptides 11 4 15 8 showed high number percentages of positive negative heterocorrelations fig 5b s24 suggesting their significant formation or photodegradation properties in conjunction with the main functional groups the inconsistent trends between psdom functional groups and molecules with increasing irradiation time were explored using negative heterocorrelations which most likely involved the photodegradation of high weight molecules with different functional groups to generate low weight molecules this was supported by the reduction in molecular weight and functional groups of psdom after one more day s irradiation mostly opposite heterosynchronous and heteroasynchronous signals also supported photodegradation of functional groups prior to molecular changes figure s25 the density distribution of functional groups showed that various inconsistent changes were mainly observed in relatively low weight psdom molecules m z 450 especially cas sugars which were closely related to the photodegradation of macromolecules fig 6 a d moreover in the relatively low molecular weight range m z 450 psdom molecules with carboxylic groups and aliphatic c h phenolic aromatic c h groups mainly contributed to the inconsistent changes degradation vs formation of husho and sugars huslo respectively in the relatively high molecular weight range 450 m z 800 huslo showed more obvious opposite trends with major functional groups therefore the mass changes of different molecular components during psdom photoaging were likely related to the photodegradation of different functional groups 3 4 2 photoaged evolution of mpps functional groups the obvious ftir features of photoaged mpps were mainly observed at 1800 800 cm 1 which were related to various functional groups such as oxidized groups monomer carboxylates in additives and carbonyl groups fig 3e s26 table s5 the degree of change in peak intensity varied with irradiation time and the peaks with large changes were related to functional groups with high photoaging sensitivity in the 2d ftir cos maps of mpps functional groups several distinctive synchronous autopeaks were observed on the diagonal lines which showed that ch2 1450 cm 1 and aromatic ring 1490 1600 cm 1 groups had strong autocorrelations fig 3c the valid asynchronous crosspeaks of mpps revealed the sequential changes in functional groups in response to increasing photoaging time which were distinguished and summarized in table s6 specifically the positive regions at v1 v2 of 1700 1770 1012 1083 1296 1608 cm 1 with centers of 1600 1495 1450 1360 and 1030 cm 1 several positive slender strips at 1450 1495 1690 800 1000 1450 1600 cm 1 and one negative slender strip at 1296 1600 1030 cm 1 were observed in the asynchronous map fig 3c table s6 the combined synchronous asynchronous signs and distribution showed that the primary sequential photoaging response of ftir peaks of mpps followed as 1012 1083 1700 1770 1450 1495 1600 1280 1450 800 1000 cm 1 according to the ftir peak assignments the primary sequential photoaging response of mpps functional groups had an order of aromatic c h bend carbonyl groups aromatic ring stretch ch2 bend c h bond stretch groups this result implied that the photodegradation of unsaturated aromatic structures of mpps was favored over the photodegradation of saturated structures which was consistent with the preferential formation of unsaturated oxidized psdom molecules 3 4 3 associations between photoaged mpps functional groups and psdom molecules the primary ftir wavenumber locations showed more significant heterocorrelations with the molecular m z in the 2d ftir ft icr ms cos map which suggested that the dominant mpps functional groups were more associated with the formation of psdom molecules fig 5c d the positive heterocorrelations were more pronounced than the negative heterocorrelations showing the good synergy and consistency for the changes of mpps groups and psdom molecules the distribution of heterocorrelation intensities showed that psdom molecules with m z 450 800 had higher heterocorrelations with mpps functional groups than molecules with m z 200 450 fig 5c therefore mpps functional groups had stronger change associations with the relatively high molecular weight psdom molecules 450 m z 800 while the relatively low molecular weight molecules m z 450 could arise from the photodegradation or transformation of mpps functional groups as indicated by the increased blue signs the negative heterocorrelations could suggest that the photodegradation of mpps functional groups contributed the formation of psdom molecules the number percentages of negative heterocorrelations of huslo 34 1 husho 21 1 aliphatics 20 6 and peptides 14 2 among correlated psdom molecules were much higher than those of other molecular classes 0 7 6 1 fig 5d therefore the huslo husho aliphatics peptides variations showed more pronounced correlations with the changes of major mpps functional groups moreover the density distribution of mpps functional groups along correlated psdom molecular m z showed that c h bond aromatic c h groups had more diverse distributions than ch2 aromatic ring oxidized carbonyl groups fig 6e h s27 therefore the photodegradation of c h bond aromatic c h groups of mpps was more active which contributed more to the diversity of psdom molecules for example the photodegradation of aromatic c h oxidized groups played an important role in the formation of huslo husho e g c17h25o8 c16h21o8 and c18h23o7 and aliphatic molecules e g c16h25o6 c15h23o and c14h21o6 respectively figure s28 the molecules below m z 450 exhibited more diverse heterocorrelations suggesting that the relatively low molecular weight molecules m z 450 formed from a broad source of photodegradation of mpps functional groups fig 6e h s27 the relatively high molecular weight molecules 450 m z 800 formed from the photodegradation of major mpps functional groups mainly focused on the aliphatic peptide huslo husho molecules which showed wider m z ranges and higher heterocorrelation intensities than cas sugar as molecules fig 6e h s27 this result indicated that photodegradation of major mpps functional groups was more likely to directly form the relatively high molecular weight molecules 450 m z 800 the relatively low molecular weight molecules m z 450 could be formed by mpps photodegradation or by transformation of relatively high molecular weight molecules 450 m z 800 thereby reducing their heterocorrelation intensities 3 5 molecular level psdom formation mechanism from photodegradation of mpps functional groups based on the main outstanding contribution of mpps photodegradation to psdom formation the molecular level formation mechanism of psdom during mpps photoaging was innovatively proposed to interpret the evolution heterogeneity and sequential response of different molecular classes with increasing irradiation time fig 7 this molecular level mechanism showed that the photodegradation of different mpps functional groups significantly contributed to the formation of different psdom molecular classes implying synergistic relationships and irradiation phase characteristics between them the sequential response of psdom molecules to increasing irradiation time can be categorized into prioritized intermediate and later stages this is following a primary response order of low oxidized high weight molecules 450 m z 800 high oxidized molecules saturated low weight molecules m z 450 fig 7 the prioritized photodegradation responses of aromatic c h groups of mpps to increasing irradiation time contributed to the initial formation of low oxidized and high weight psdom molecules 450 m z 800 which was consistent with the highest huslo percentage fig 7 the chromophore groups like aromatics in mpps macromolecules acted as initiators responsible for triggering photochemical reactions such as the absorption of light quanta by benzene ring to form excited singlet state mpps wu et al 2022 the aromatic c h c c groups of mpps could be preferentially cleaved under sufficient irradiation energy induction resulting in the scission of mpps polymer backbone and the formation of relatively high weight psdom molecules this phenomenon was consistent with the reported low break energy of c c bonds 284 368 kj mol and c h bonds 380 410 kj mol during ps photodegradation wu et al 2022 the subsequent photodegradation reactions involving free radicals of specific mpps functional groups could cause a series of chain induction diffusion scission and termination resulting in the formation of low oxidized psdom molecules with hydroxyl carboxyl carbonyl groups yousif and haddad 2013 zhu et al 2020 for example the preferential breaks of aromatic c h bonds of mpps could react with oxygen to generate c o thereby further oxidizing to unsaturated molecules e g aldehydes ketones ethers with carbonyl and phenolic hydroxyl groups through free radical reactions occurred qiu et al 2022 the low oxidized psdom molecules formed in this stage showed diverse chemical properties and were more sensitive to the changing irradiation time causing their significant nosc changes the intermediate photodegradation responses of carbonyl and aromatic ring groups of mpps to increasing irradiation time were mainly related to the formation of high oxidized psdom molecules such as the second largest percentage of husho fig 7 the obvious reactions of carbonyl groups of mpps in this stage could be due to the dissociation and chain scission of polystyryl radicals formed by generating excited states during the initial photochemical reactions yousif and haddad 2013 zhang et al 2021b the apparent responses of carbonyl groups of mpps to increasing irradiation time indicated the occurrence of oxidation reactions with chain scission leading to the formation of psdom molecules with high oxidation degree wu et al 2022 moreover the apparent reactions of aromatic ring groups of mpps provided direct support for the reactions involving ring structure induced by uv irradiation zhang et al 2000 the oxygen uptake by the ring and the increased symmetry of chromophore by attaching functional groups at the para position of ring provided the possibility for the conversion reaction from aromatic vibration of mpps to dissolved oxygen containing species zhang et al 2000 for example when the benzene ring with free radicals was close to the hydroxyl radicals new phenol like molecules in psdom were easily formed through cross linking during the fragmentation of phenyl centers overall the fragmentation oxidation free radical reactions during mpps photoaging were more pronounced which resulted in more significant changes in the number of high oxidized psdom molecules such as the transformation from reduced molecules to oxidized molecules through the enhanced reactions of polystyryl peroxy radicals with oxygen yousif and haddad 2013 the later photodegradation responses of ch2 c h groups of mpps to increasing irradiation time mainly contributed to the later formation of saturated and low weight psdom molecules m z 450 especially aliphatic peptide molecules fig 7 after the photochemical reactions of aromatic rings of mpps the excitation energy could be transferred to the h atom in the nearest c h ch2 bond through the intramolecular resulting in the cleavage of hydrogen and the formation of saturated psdom molecules such as aliphatic molecules with alkyl groups wu et al 2022 yousif and haddad 2013 therefore the saturation of mpps functional groups in this later photodegradation stage played a major role in the secondary reactions such as chain scission intramolecular breakdown reactions ainali et al 2021 resulting in a broad formation source of psdom molecules moreover the apparent generation of saturated psdom molecules was an important reason for the strong sensitivity of their nosc property to increasing irradiation time the large changes in molecular weights of psdom could be related to the intramolecular hydrogen transfer followed by the mid chain carbon bond scission and random scission during photodegradation of mpps ainali et al 2021 the dynamic formation of molecules could also involve a partial conversion from high weight molecules with different functional groups to low weight molecules during photoaging of psdom itself but this was much smaller than the contribution of mpps photodegradation to low weight molecules the photodegradation of psdom with aromatic aliphatic c h phenolic carboxylic groups mainly contributed to the huslo husho aliphatics peptides formation which was more pronounced for low molecular weight molecules m z 450 the psdom molecules formed in the previous stage of irradiation especially easily photodegradable molecules formed in the early stage of photoaging were almost photodegraded after one more day s irradiation which was supported by the dramatic disappearance of features of fluorescent components and functional groups therefore a small amount of photodegradation products produced by psdom itself had little effect on the formation characteristics of filtered psdom in the next irradiation stage which also highlighted the dominant role of mpps photoaging on the molecular formation we demonstrated the significant difference in photoaging between mpps and psdom using the information comparison which was crucial for understanding the dynamic formation mechanism of psdom molecules given that mpps and psdom were photodegraded simultaneously in the same aging system how to separate and quantify their specific contributions to different molecules still needs to be further explored 4 conclusions the powerful 2d ft icr ms ftir cos application helps establish a novel molecular level psdom formation mechanism for the first time demonstrating the heterogeneity dynamic evolution and sequential irradiation response of psdom molecules during mpps photoaging photochemical transformations occurred between saturated reduced and oxidized molecules during psdom leaching the photodegradation of mpps functional groups showed higher contribution to the huslo husho aliphatics peptides variations and to the formation of psdom molecules with m z 450 800 than molecules with m z 200 450 the photodegradation of c h bond and aromatic c h bend groups of mpps was more active which contributed more to the diversity of psdom molecules moreover the primary sequential response of psdom molecules to increasing irradiation time low oxidized high weight 450 m z 800 high oxidized saturated low weight molecules m z 450 corresponded to the response of mpps functional groups aromatic c h carbonyl aromatic ring ch2 bend c h groups showing well synergistic relationships between them these novel findings will contribute to the understanding of formation transformation and underappreciated behaviors of mpdom in aquatic ecosystems

14657,dissolved effluent organic matter efom plays an important role in ozonation decomposition and hydroxyl radical oh scavenging in ozonation for the degradation of trace organic contaminants trocs in municipal secondary effluents the properties of efom have been considered a major concern in this process because efom fractions act differently as initiator promoter or inhibitor of ozone decomposition and oh scavenging which further impacts the degradation effectiveness of trocs this study isolated efom from three wastewater treatment plants into six fractions hoa hob hon hia hib and hin to understand the reaction kinetics as a function of efom and its isolated fractions their reaction rate constants with oh kefom oh and their roles as the initiator promoter and inhibitor in the oh chain reactions in ozone decomposition were further quantified the results showed that kefom oh of hydrophilic fractions hif accounting for 17 reached up to 10 times as high as that for hydrophobic fractions hof accounting for 83 7 92 108 m 1 s 1 versus 0 78 108 m 1 s 1 suggesting the dominating role of hif in oh scavenging hydrophilic base hib was the most important fraction dominating the ozone decomposition and reaction with oh due to its highest rate constants of initiation and promotion this study quantifies the kinetics and contribution of efom fractions in oh scavenging which will guide the optimization implementation of ozonation and other oh mediated aops toward wastewater effluents graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords ozonation dissolved effluent organic

purification in wastewater treatment plants wwtps during the ozonation pollutants can be removed by the direct oxidation with ozone and or the oxidation with the generated strong and non selective oxidant hydroxyl radical oh coha et al 2021 however it has been demonstrated that the existing dissolved effluent organic matter efom can play multiple roles in the degradation and transformation of trace organic contaminants trocs during ozonation mainly via competing with trocs as major oh scavengers wert et al 2009 yang et al 2021 2022 despite a comprehensive understanding of the importance of efom on scavenging oh the reactivity of efom with oh has not been well understood yet due to the heterogeneity of efom fractions and their complex properties therefore improving the understanding of the reactivity of efom with o3 and oh is beneficial to trocs elimination during ozonation and other oh mediated water purification efom is a mixture of natural organic matter nom soluble microbial products and organic micropollutants su et al 2021 the difficulty in defining its nature is a limitation in understanding its reactivity dong et al 2010 yang et al 2022 numerous studies have determined the rate constants of efom with oh k oh efom to model and predict the removal of trocs with the co existence of efom in secondary effluent in addition it has been reported that k oh efom are generally affected by the molecular weight dong et al 2010 westerhoff et al 2007 functional groups staehelln and hoigne 1985 and polarity keen et al 2014 westerhoff et al 2007 of efom molecules but with some discrepancies for example keen et al 2014 collected and characterized 28 wastewater effluent samples to figure out the influencing factors for the reactivity of efom with oh they reported that chemical oxygen demand retention onto nh2 extraction medium fluorescence index and total organic carbon are four main influencing factors accounting for around 62 of the variability of rate constants of efom with oh dong et al 2010 further isolated efom into distinct apparent molecular weight amw fractions and found the negative correlation between k oh efom and amw furthermore the hydrophilic and hydrophobic characteristics of efom influence its chemical activity and performance polubesova and chefetz 2014 and is postulated to impact its reactivity with oh westerhoff et al 2007 found that the reaction rate constants of oh with hydrophilic fractions hif isolated from nom doubled those for hydrophobic fractions hof but without further investigation of other efom fractions the understanding of reactivity of efom with oh as a function of its isolated fractions is conducive to the explanation of reaction mechanisms and prediction optimization of contaminant elimination during oh mediated water purification furthermore efom with different chemical structures and physicochemical characteristics has been demonstrated to involve in ozone decomposition and radical production and chain reactions westerhoff et al 1999 that is there are four reaction modes of efom in ozonation including direct reaction with ozone initiation promotion and inhibition of the chain reactions as defined by staehelln and hoigne 1985 the rct concept was put forward to represent the ratio of the oh exposure to o3 exposure as a function of time elovitz and von gunten 1999 and has been commonly used to quantify the oh concentration generated from ozone decomposition and model the removal of organic pollutants yong and lin 2012 integrated the rct concept and the transient steady state oh concentration to develop a new kinetic model to quantify the rate constants of these four reaction modes of nom and efom the quantification of initiation promotion and inhibition of isolated efom fractions could help clarify the roles and contribution to the reactivity of efom with oh efom can be isolated into different fractions according to different physicochemical properties i e hydrophilic acids hia hydrophilic bases hib hydrophilic neutrals hin hydrophobic acids hoa hydrophobic bases hob and hydrophobic neutrals hon in spite of several studies regarding the reaction rate of efom with oh to the best of the authors knowledge the oh reactivity and contributions of isolated efom fractions to oh scavenging have not been systematically reported in addition most prior studies on oh were obtained using pulse radiolysis wherein this study will determine reaction rates during the ozonation of water therefore this study aims to clarify the roles of efom and its fractions in ozone decomposition and oh scavenging during the ozonation by efom fractionation reaction kinetics of efom fractions with oh and subsequent their contribution quantification the objectives go as follows 1 to isolate efom into six individual fractions using the modified resin isolated method 2 to characterize efom and its fractions 3 to determine their reaction rate constants with oh using the

in the dark at 4 c for rapid analysis the efom fractionation and isolation was conducted with modified resins method leenheer 1981 świetlik et al 2004 zhang et al 2009 as illustrated in text s2 and fig s2 and efom was fractioned into hoa hob hon hia hib and hin then the isolated six fractions were collected and stored at 4 c 2 3 ozonation experiments all samples were diluted to the same doc concentration 2 mg l the water samples were pre acidified and purged with ultra pure n2 bubbling to remove hco3 co3 2 for kinetic studies elovitz and von gunten 1999 other potential salts such as ammonia nitrate nitrite and bromide were not considered as major oh scavengers due to their low concentrations in effluents as shown in tables s1 and s2 and or low reaction rates with oh table s3 in addition the concentrations of these salts in our samples should be extremely low because the effluents were diluted at least 4 times to ensure doc concentrations of 2 mg l raw doc concentrations for wwtp q s and j were 21 30 8 25 40 51 mg l respectively in table s1 the kinetic method was used to determine the pseudo second order reaction rate constants of efom fractions with oh and the initiation promotion and inhibition capacities of efom fractions in ozonation elovitz and von gunten 1999 keen et al 2014 yong and lin 2012 all experiments were conducted at 20 1 c the reactivity of efom and its fractions with ozone and oh can be obtained from the determination of reaction rate constants yong and lin 2016 in brief ozone was produced by an ozone generator togc2 triogen ltd scotland uk with high purity o2 99 995 as a gas source a concentrated ozone stock solution was prepared by purging ozone containing oxygen until o3 in di water ph was adjusted at around 2 and cooled in an ice bath reached equilibrium the concentration of concentrated ozone stock solution was measured at about 60 mg l 1 25 mm and the ozone solution temperature is 0 c the ozone solution was freshly prepared and the ozone concentration was measured before every use a volume of 500 ml water samples was added into the reactor at ph 8 using 10 mm na2hpo4 and nah2po4 as buffer solutions p cba 0 5 μm was added as a oh probe compound yong and lin 2012 tert butyl alcohol tba solutions at various concentrations 0 20 60 100 250 and 500 μm were added as the inhibitor the reaction was initiated with the addition of ozone stock solution to achieve the o3 to doc ratio of 1 1 the solution ph stayed constant throughout the experiments with a maximum variation of 0 1 ph unit aliquots of the samples were collected at

correlation analysis was conducted after data normalization using spss 28 0 software ibm usa 2 5 contribution to oh scavenging the scavenging rate of efom with oh is not only related to oh reaction rate constants but also to different proportions of isolated efom fractions in real ozonation applications therefore the contribution of efom fractions to the oh scavenging was defined as eq 1 1 c o n

fraction distribution the water quality parameters of secondary effluents from wwtps q s and j are summarized in table s1 water samples from wwtp j had the highest doc at 40 51 mg l and that for wwtp s was the lowest at 8 25 mg l due to different treatment processes in different wwtps fig s1 the efom fraction distribution was similar among three wwtps as shown in fig 1 and table s4 it is found that hof was dominant in efom accounting for 66 in the range of 58 73 of doc compared with hif average at 17 in the range of 12 25 consistent with the dominance of hof in efom reported in previous studies qi et al 2018 świetlik et al 2004 wang et al 2007 zhang et al 2009 the organic loss was around 18 during efom fractionation notably 100 of doc recovery cannot be achieved for efom fractionation resulting from the trace resin dissolution detection errors etc as shown in fig 1 hon was higher than hoa with hob the lowest only 2 among hof and the same trend was also found in hif despite with larger deviations among different wwtps consistent with some previous studies qi et al 2018 zhang et al 2009 the large variations in efom fraction distribution among different studies are most likely attributed to different wastewater sources and treatment processes indicating the high site specificity of efom fraction distribution jin et al 2016 zhang et al 2009 eem spectra represent the chemical structure of efom in the water matrix and it can be found that three apparent eem peaks representing tyrosine like aromatic protein fulvic acid and humic acid were all observed for three wwtps table s5 table s6 and fig s3 consistent with that reported by jin et al 2016 3 2 rate constants between oh and efom and its isolated fractions in order to quantify the reactivity of efom and its fractions with oh their reaction rate constants k oh efom from three wwtps were calculated text s3 and shown in table 1 it should be noted that the impact of carbonate in efom was pre excluded and the impact of ammonia nitrogen nitrite and nitrate in efom was extremely lower than that of organic matter with oh and therefore their reaction rate constants were deducted keen et al 2014 the k oh efom values of efom was in the range of 1 27 108 3 06 108 m 1 s 1 average at 2 36 0 95 108 m 1 s 1 which were in the same order of magnitude as those reported in previous studies dong et al 2010 keen et al 2014 in spite of some discrepancies numerous studies indicated that the k oh efom values are related to some water quality parameters including doc uv254 molecular weight mw etc for example dong et al 2010 and rosario ortiz et al 2008 reported that k oh efom positively correlated to suva254 while westerhoff et al 2007 reported that there was no relation between the oh capture ability of nom and suva254 in this study k oh efom values for three wwtps was found negatively related to their mw this may be due to the fact that the molecular size and geometry of efom may limit the diffusion of oh and therefore reduce the reaction rate between efom and oh westerhoff et al 2007 resulting in lower rate constants of high mw efom however no obvious relationship was found between k oh efom values and uv254 and doc with poor fitting figs s4 probably attributed to the low sample size the correlation of k oh efom with suva254 r2 0 09 was also compared with the correlation of rate constants for co3 cl2 br br2 and so4 with suva254 yang et al 2022 as presented in fig s5 as shown in table 1 the largely different k oh efom values of isolated efom fractions from those of efom in three wwtps suggest that isolated efom fractions exhibited different characteristics and oh scavenging ability from their mixture to be specific the reaction rate constants of hif with oh 7 92 1 74 108 m 1 s 1 were around 10 times as high as that for hof 0 78 0 44 108 m 1 s 1 and this is also true for bases acids as well as neutrals i e hib hob hia hoa and hin hon p 0 05 westerhoff et al 2007 also reported that the reaction rate constants of oh with hif isolated from nom doubled those for hof this indicates that hif had a higher reactivity with oh than hof and may play a dominant role as oh scavenger in ozonation furthermore the k oh efom values of hif followed the order of hib hia hin but without significant difference p 0 05 average at 9 24 0 56 108 8 15 0 83 108 and 6 37 2 19 108 m 1 s 1 respectively similar trends were also found for hof indicating that the acidic base and neutral characteristics had no obvious effects on the reactivity with oh the high k oh efom values of hif may be attributed to their abundance of hydrophilic functional groups such as oh cho cooh and nh2 leenheer 1981 principally consisting of aliphatic carboxylic acids aliphatic amino acids and aliphatic amines polypeptides and polysaccharide compounds table s7 michael kordatou et al 2015 the ample hydroxyl and carboxyl groups in hif are more susceptible to ozonation leading to higher reaction rate constants of hif with oh keen et al 2014 staehelln and hoigne 1985 on the other hand hif had a lower molecular weight table s8 which can also explain their high reactivity with oh the reaction rate constants of oh with reactive sites at the center of large molecules are close to diffusional limitation rates even though some sites are probably blocked due to the self folding of larger molecules westerhoff et al 1999 in this regard as the molecular weight decreases the three dimensional structure of efom may become less aggregated and more exposed leading to higher reactivity on a per carbon atom basis dong et al 2010 westerhoff et al 2007 this is consistent with the significantly negative correlation between k oh efom of isolated efom fractions and their doc values p 0 05 fig s4 because efom fractions with lower doc values were generally associated with a longer biological treatment process in wwtps resulting in the formation of smaller efom molecules with higher reactivity keen et al 2014 3 3 initiation promotion and inhibition rate constants of efom and its isolated fractions efom can directly react with ozone and simultaneously act as an initiator promotor and inhibitor in the oh chain reactions during ozonation cai and lin 2016 staehelln and hoigne 1985 yong and lin 2012 the rate constants of initiation ki direct reaction kd promotion kp and inhibition ks of efom and its fractions were calculated by eqs 2 7 as shown in fig s6 and table 2 the kd ki kp and ks values of different efom fractions were in the same order of magnitudes average at 3 52 10 4 3 77 10 3 4 18 104 and 6 25 103 l mgc 1 s 1 respectively compared with the only report on the quantification of ki kd kp and ks of efom cai and lin 2016 the kd and kp values were of the same magnitude and the ki and ks values were an order of magnitude higher in this study the kd ki was further calculated to differentiate the contributions of direct reaction and initiation reaction to the reactivity of efom toward ozone while kp ks was calculated to differentiate the contributions of promotion and inhibition the kd ki and kp ks values were 0 09 and 6 7 indicating the dominance of initiation in the ozone efom reaction consuming 92 of ozone and promotion dominated the oh efom reaction consuming 87 of oh the dominance of promotion was consistent with previous cases of efom cai and lin 2016 and nom yong and lin 2016 in spite of the dominance of direct reaction rather than initiation in the ozone efom reaction in their studies the initiation promotion and inhibition rate constants of isolated efom fractions were also shown in table 2 to further understand their capacity as initiators promotors and inhibitors during ozone decomposition the results indicate that the ki values of isolated efom fractions showed a significant difference between hif and hof average at 6 58 10 3 and 3 39 10 3 l mgc 1 s 1 respectively p 0 05 the abundance of hydroxyl groups in hif made a dominant contribution which can initiate the decomposition of o3 to o3 staehelln and hoigne 1985 to be specific the average ki values of isolated efom fractions followed the order of hib hia hin hoa hon hob but no significant difference was found among the ki values of acids bases and neutrals p 0 05 this indicates the dominance of hif in initiation reaction and the important role of the hydrophily hydrophobicity of efom fractions in initiation reaction rather than their acid base properties in spite of no significant difference found for both ks and kp values of hif and hof the kp values of isolated efom fractions followed the order of hib hob hia hon hoa hin this suggests that bases played a principal role in the promotion reaction followed by acids and neutrals average at 15 76 104 8 16 104 and 7 93 104 l mgc 1 s 1 respectively in comparison the ks values were in the order of hon hib hin hob hoa hia with the values of 10 07 103 8 81 103 6 96 103 4 09 103 1 28 103 and 0 92 103 l mgc 1 s 1 respectively indicating the major effects of neutrals and bases on promotion reaction in brief hib was found to be the maximal initiator and promotor on the oh production in three wwtps with the average ki and kp values of 10 58 10 3 l mgc 1 s 1 and 9 07 104 l mgc 1 s 1 respectively the ks value of hib also ranked the second only behind that of hon in terms of inhibition therefore hib was the most important fraction dominating the ozone decomposition and oh capture determining the reactivity of efom in ozonation 3 4 contribution of isolated efom fractions to oh scavenging during the ozonation of secondary effluents from wwtps co existing efom is highly competitive to capture non selective oh significantly reducing the removal of trocs lee et al 2013 therefore it is crucial to pick out efom subcomponents with the highest contribution to oh scavenging the contribution of isolated efom fractions to the oh scavenging was calculated according to eq 1 and the results are shown in fig 2 and table s9 it is found that hif contributed more than hof in all three wwtps with an average of 80 consistent with their higher rate constants with oh table 1 in spite of their lower doc table s4 specifically hia contributed the most in wwtps q and j accounting for 61 and 43 respectively whereas hin was the fraction with the greatest contribution in wwtp s accounting for 43 in contrast hob made the minimal contribution in wwtps s and j while hon contributed the lowest in wwtp q the initiation promotion and inhibition contributions of isolated efom fractions in wwtps were further calculated according to eq 1 with results presented in fig 3 and table s10 it can be found that hof contributed more to initiation promotion as well as inhibition compared with hif which is inverse to the dominance of hif in the contribution to reaction rate constants with oh this is probably due to the higher doc of hof as shown in fig 1 the contributions of acids and neutrals were close to initiation 46 and 43 respectively while neutral components predominantly contributed to promotion and inhibition at 55 and 74 respectively it is worth noting that although the reactivity of efom fractions with oh may have little difference among different wwtps their proportions in efom are mostly likely to vary greatly resulting in their different contributions to oh scavenging therefore it is suggested to roughly determine the proportions of hydrophilic and hydrophobic fractions to estimate their contribution to oh scavenging in this case efom fractions with the highest contribution are suggested to be reduced or removed during pre treatment processes before ozonation to increase the removal of trocs some advanced wastewater treatment techniques such as adsorption liang et al 2021 ion exchange liu et al 2019 and membrane filtration shao et al 2022 have been reported to remove organic matter with different molecular weights and hydrophobicity to varying degrees the applications of these methods should be able to change the efom fractions and further change the rate constant of efom with oh however a pretreatment process that can preferentially and cost efficiently remove hydrophilic fractions is suggested to be developed in the future 4 conclusions this study investigated the reactivity of efom with oh as a function of its isolated efom fractions and further quantified their contribution to oh scavenging during ozonation of municipal secondary effluents our results demonstrate the vital role of hydrophily hydrophobicity characteristics of efom in its reactivity with oh during ozonation the reaction rate constant of hif with oh reaches up to 10 times as high as that for hof indicating that hif plays a crucial role in oh scavenging furthermore hib was found to be the most important fraction dominating the ozone decomposition and reactivity with oh we further defined and evaluated the contribution to oh scavenging and found that hif made a predominant contribution it should be noted that among hif hia made the highest contribution with the highest reaction rate constants with oh therefore for the three wwtps in this study it is crucial to minimize hif especially hia in the pre treatment process to increase the efficiency of ozonation and the development of corresponding proper pre treatment processes is worthy of future investigation the findings of this study will also give us some fundamental ideas of which classes of efom fractions should be removed in the pretreatment process to enhance the removal of trace

14657,dissolved effluent organic matter efom plays an important role in ozonation decomposition and hydroxyl radical oh scavenging in ozonation for the degradation of trace organic contaminants trocs in municipal secondary effluents the properties of efom have been considered a major concern in this process because efom fractions act differently as initiator promoter or inhibitor of ozone decomposition and oh scavenging which further impacts the degradation effectiveness of trocs this study isolated efom from three wastewater treatment plants into six fractions hoa hob hon hia hib and hin to understand the reaction kinetics as a function of efom and its isolated fractions their reaction rate constants with oh kefom oh and their roles as the initiator promoter and inhibitor in the oh chain reactions in ozone decomposition were further quantified the results showed that kefom oh of hydrophilic fractions hif accounting for 17 reached up to 10 times as high as that for hydrophobic fractions hof accounting for 83 7 92 108 m 1 s 1 versus 0 78 108 m 1 s 1 suggesting the dominating role of hif in oh scavenging hydrophilic base hib was the most important fraction dominating the ozone decomposition and reaction with oh due to its highest rate constants of initiation and promotion this study quantifies the kinetics and contribution of efom fractions in oh scavenging which will

purification in wastewater treatment plants wwtps during the ozonation pollutants can be removed by the direct oxidation with ozone and or the oxidation with the generated strong and non selective oxidant hydroxyl radical oh coha et al 2021 however it has been demonstrated that the existing dissolved effluent organic matter efom can play multiple roles in the degradation and transformation of trace organic contaminants trocs during ozonation mainly via competing with trocs as major oh scavengers wert et al 2009 yang et al 2021 2022 despite a comprehensive understanding of the importance of efom on scavenging oh the reactivity of efom with oh has not been well understood yet due to the heterogeneity of efom fractions and their complex properties therefore improving the understanding of the reactivity of efom with o3 and oh is beneficial to trocs elimination during ozonation and other oh mediated water purification efom is a mixture of natural organic matter nom soluble microbial products and organic micropollutants su et al 2021 the difficulty in defining its nature is a limitation in understanding its reactivity dong et al 2010 yang et al 2022 numerous studies have determined the rate constants of efom with oh k oh efom to model and predict the removal of trocs with the co existence of efom in secondary effluent in addition it has been reported that k oh efom are generally affected by the molecular weight dong et al 2010 westerhoff et al 2007 functional groups staehelln and hoigne 1985 and polarity keen et al 2014 westerhoff et al 2007 of efom molecules but with some discrepancies for example keen et al 2014 collected and characterized 28 wastewater effluent samples to figure out the influencing factors for the reactivity of efom with oh they reported that chemical oxygen demand retention onto nh2 extraction medium fluorescence index and total organic carbon are four main influencing factors accounting for around 62 of the variability of rate constants of efom with oh dong et al 2010 further isolated efom into distinct apparent molecular weight amw fractions and found the negative correlation between k oh efom and amw furthermore the hydrophilic and hydrophobic characteristics of efom influence its chemical activity and performance polubesova and chefetz 2014 and is postulated to impact its reactivity with oh westerhoff et al 2007 found that the reaction rate constants of oh with hydrophilic fractions hif isolated from nom doubled those for hydrophobic fractions hof but without further investigation of other efom fractions the understanding of reactivity of efom with oh as a function of its isolated fractions is conducive to the explanation of reaction mechanisms and prediction optimization of contaminant elimination during oh mediated water purification furthermore efom with different chemical structures and physicochemical characteristics has been demonstrated to involve in ozone decomposition and radical production and chain reactions westerhoff et al 1999 that is there are four reaction modes of efom in ozonation including direct reaction with ozone initiation promotion and inhibition of the chain reactions as

used to quantify the oh concentration generated from ozone decomposition and model the removal of organic pollutants yong and lin 2012 integrated the rct concept and the transient steady state oh concentration to develop a new kinetic model to quantify the rate constants of these four reaction modes of nom and efom the quantification of initiation promotion and inhibition of isolated efom

rate constants but also to different proportions of isolated efom fractions in real ozonation applications therefore the contribution of efom fractions to the oh scavenging was defined as eq 1 1 c o n

fraction distribution the water quality parameters of secondary effluents from wwtps q s and j are summarized in table s1 water samples from wwtp j had the highest doc at 40 51 mg l and that for wwtp s was the lowest at 8 25 mg l due to different treatment processes in different wwtps fig s1 the efom fraction distribution was similar among three wwtps as shown in fig 1 and table s4 it is found that hof was dominant in efom accounting for 66 in the range of 58 73 of doc compared with hif average at 17 in the range of 12 25 consistent with the dominance of hof in efom reported in previous studies qi et al 2018 świetlik et al 2004 wang et al 2007 zhang et al 2009 the organic loss was around 18 during efom fractionation notably 100 of doc recovery cannot be achieved for efom fractionation resulting from the trace resin dissolution detection errors etc as shown in fig 1 hon was higher than hoa with hob the lowest only 2 among hof and the same trend was also found in hif despite with larger deviations among different wwtps consistent with some previous studies qi et al 2018 zhang et al 2009 the large variations in efom fraction distribution among different studies are most likely attributed to different wastewater sources and treatment processes indicating the high site specificity of efom fraction distribution jin et al 2016 zhang et al 2009 eem spectra represent the chemical structure of efom in the water matrix and it can be found that three apparent eem peaks representing tyrosine like aromatic protein fulvic acid and humic acid were all observed for three wwtps table s5 table s6 and fig s3 consistent with that reported by jin et al 2016 3 2 rate constants between oh and efom and its isolated fractions in order to quantify the reactivity of efom and its fractions with oh their reaction rate constants k oh efom from three wwtps were calculated text s3 and shown in table 1 it should be noted that the impact of carbonate in efom was pre excluded and the impact of ammonia nitrogen nitrite and nitrate in efom was extremely lower than that of organic matter with oh and therefore their reaction rate constants were deducted keen et al 2014 the k oh efom values of efom was in the range of 1 27 108 3 06 108 m 1 s 1 average at 2 36 0 95 108 m 1 s 1 which were in the same order of magnitude as those reported in previous studies dong et al 2010 keen et al 2014 in spite of some discrepancies numerous studies indicated that the k oh efom values are related to some water quality parameters including doc uv254 molecular weight mw etc for example dong et al 2010 and rosario ortiz et al 2008 reported that k oh efom positively correlated to suva254 while westerhoff et al 2007 reported that there was no relation between the oh capture ability of nom and suva254 in this study k oh efom values for three wwtps was found negatively related to their mw this may be due to the fact that the molecular size and geometry of efom may limit the diffusion of oh and therefore reduce the reaction rate between efom and oh westerhoff et al 2007 resulting in lower rate constants of high mw efom however no obvious relationship was found between k oh efom values and uv254 and doc with poor fitting figs s4 probably attributed to the low sample size the correlation of k oh efom with suva254 r2 0 09 was also compared with the correlation of rate constants for co3 cl2 br br2 and so4 with suva254 yang et al 2022 as presented in fig s5 as shown in table 1 the largely different k oh efom values of isolated efom fractions from those of efom in three wwtps suggest that isolated efom fractions exhibited different characteristics and oh scavenging ability from their mixture to be specific the reaction rate constants of hif with oh 7 92 1 74 108 m 1 s 1 were around 10 times as high as that for hof 0 78 0 44 108 m 1 s 1 and this is also true for bases acids as well as neutrals i e hib hob hia hoa and hin hon p 0 05 westerhoff et al 2007 also reported that the reaction rate constants of oh with hif isolated from nom doubled those for hof this indicates that hif had a higher reactivity with oh than hof and may play a dominant role as oh scavenger in ozonation furthermore the k oh efom values of hif followed the order of hib hia hin but without significant difference p 0 05 average at 9 24 0 56 108 8 15 0 83 108 and 6 37 2 19 108 m 1 s 1 respectively similar trends were also found for hof indicating that the acidic base and neutral characteristics had no obvious effects on the reactivity with oh the high k oh efom values of hif may be attributed to their abundance of hydrophilic functional groups such as oh cho cooh and nh2 leenheer 1981 principally consisting of aliphatic carboxylic acids aliphatic amino acids and aliphatic amines polypeptides and polysaccharide compounds table s7 michael kordatou et al 2015 the ample hydroxyl and carboxyl groups in hif are more susceptible to ozonation leading to higher reaction rate constants of hif with oh keen et al 2014 staehelln and hoigne 1985 on the other hand hif had a lower molecular weight table s8 which can also explain their high reactivity with oh the reaction rate constants of oh with reactive sites at the center of large molecules are close to diffusional limitation rates even though some sites are probably blocked due to the self folding of larger molecules westerhoff et al 1999 in this regard as the molecular weight decreases the three dimensional structure of efom may become less aggregated and more exposed leading to higher reactivity on a per carbon atom basis dong et al 2010 westerhoff et al 2007 this is consistent with the significantly negative correlation between k oh efom of isolated efom fractions and their doc values p 0 05 fig s4 because efom fractions with lower doc values were generally associated with a longer biological treatment process in wwtps resulting in the formation of smaller efom molecules with higher reactivity keen et al 2014 3 3 initiation promotion and inhibition rate constants of efom and its isolated fractions efom can directly react with ozone and simultaneously act as an initiator promotor and inhibitor in the oh chain reactions during ozonation cai and lin 2016 staehelln and hoigne 1985 yong and lin 2012 the rate constants of initiation ki direct reaction kd promotion kp and inhibition ks of efom and its fractions were calculated by eqs 2 7 as shown in fig s6 and table 2 the kd ki kp and ks values of different efom fractions were in the same order of magnitudes average at 3 52 10 4 3 77 10 3 4 18 104 and 6 25 103 l mgc 1 s 1 respectively compared with the only report on the quantification of ki kd kp and ks of efom cai and lin 2016 the kd and kp values were of the same magnitude and the ki and ks values were an order of magnitude higher in this study the kd ki was further calculated to differentiate the contributions of direct reaction and initiation reaction to the reactivity of efom toward ozone while kp ks was calculated to differentiate the contributions of promotion and inhibition the kd ki and kp ks values were 0 09 and 6 7 indicating the dominance of initiation in the ozone efom reaction consuming 92 of ozone and promotion dominated the oh efom reaction consuming 87 of oh the dominance of promotion was consistent with previous cases of efom cai and lin 2016 and nom yong and lin 2016 in spite of the dominance of direct reaction rather than initiation in the ozone efom reaction in their studies the initiation promotion and inhibition rate constants of isolated efom fractions were also shown in table 2 to further understand their capacity as initiators promotors and inhibitors during ozone decomposition the results indicate that the ki values of isolated efom fractions showed a significant difference between hif and hof average at 6 58 10 3 and 3 39 10 3 l mgc 1 s 1 respectively p 0 05 the abundance of hydroxyl groups in hif made a dominant contribution which can initiate the decomposition of o3 to o3 staehelln and hoigne 1985 to be specific the average ki values of isolated efom fractions followed the order of hib hia hin hoa hon hob but no significant difference was found among the ki values of acids bases and neutrals p 0 05 this indicates the dominance of hif in initiation reaction and the important role of the hydrophily hydrophobicity of efom fractions in initiation reaction rather than their acid base properties in spite of no significant difference found for both ks and kp values of hif and hof the kp values of isolated efom fractions followed the order of hib hob hia hon hoa hin this suggests that bases played a principal role in the promotion reaction followed by acids and neutrals average at 15 76 104 8 16 104 and 7 93 104 l mgc 1 s 1 respectively in comparison the ks values were in the order of hon hib hin hob hoa hia with the values of 10 07 103 8 81 103 6 96 103 4 09 103 1 28 103 and 0 92 103 l mgc 1 s 1 respectively indicating the major effects of neutrals and bases on promotion reaction in brief hib was found to be the maximal initiator and promotor on the oh production in three wwtps with the average ki and kp values of 10 58 10 3 l mgc 1 s 1 and 9 07 104 l mgc 1 s 1 respectively the ks value of hib also ranked the second only behind that of hon in terms of inhibition therefore hib was the most important fraction dominating the ozone decomposition and oh capture determining the reactivity of efom in ozonation 3 4 contribution of isolated efom fractions to oh scavenging during the ozonation of secondary effluents from wwtps co existing efom is highly competitive to capture non selective oh significantly reducing the removal of trocs lee et al 2013 therefore it is crucial to pick out efom subcomponents with the highest contribution to oh scavenging the contribution of isolated efom fractions to the oh scavenging was calculated according to eq 1 and the results are shown in fig 2 and table s9 it is found that hif contributed more than hof in all three wwtps with an average of 80 consistent with their higher rate constants with oh table 1 in spite of their lower doc table s4 specifically hia contributed the most in wwtps q and j accounting for 61 and 43 respectively whereas hin was the fraction with the greatest contribution in wwtp s accounting for 43 in contrast hob made the minimal contribution in wwtps s and j while hon contributed the lowest in wwtp q the initiation promotion and inhibition contributions of isolated efom fractions in wwtps were further calculated according to eq 1 with results presented in fig 3 and table s10 it can be found that hof contributed more to initiation promotion as well as inhibition compared with hif which is inverse to the dominance of hif in the contribution to reaction rate constants with oh this is probably due to the higher doc of hof as shown in fig 1 the contributions of acids and neutrals were close to initiation 46 and 43 respectively while neutral components predominantly contributed to promotion and inhibition at 55 and 74 respectively it is worth noting that although the reactivity of efom fractions with oh may have little difference among different wwtps their proportions in efom are mostly likely to vary greatly resulting in their different contributions to oh scavenging therefore it is suggested to roughly determine the proportions of hydrophilic and hydrophobic fractions to estimate their contribution to oh scavenging in this case efom fractions with the highest contribution are suggested to be reduced or removed during pre treatment processes before ozonation to increase the removal of trocs some advanced wastewater treatment techniques such as adsorption liang et al 2021 ion exchange liu et al 2019 and membrane filtration shao et al 2022 have been reported to remove organic matter with different molecular weights and hydrophobicity to varying degrees the applications of these methods should be able to change the efom fractions and further change the rate constant of efom with oh however a pretreatment process that can preferentially and cost efficiently remove hydrophilic fractions is suggested to be developed in the future 4 conclusions this study investigated the reactivity of efom with oh as a function of its isolated efom fractions and further quantified their contribution to oh scavenging during ozonation of municipal secondary effluents our results demonstrate the vital role of hydrophily hydrophobicity characteristics of efom in its reactivity with oh during ozonation the reaction rate constant of hif with oh reaches up to 10 times as high as that for hof indicating that hif plays a crucial role in oh scavenging furthermore hib was found to be the most important fraction dominating the ozone decomposition and reactivity with oh we further defined and evaluated the contribution to oh scavenging and found that hif made a predominant contribution it should be noted that among hif hia made the highest contribution with the highest reaction rate constants with oh therefore for the three wwtps in this study it is crucial to minimize hif especially hia in the pre treatment process to increase the efficiency of ozonation and the development of corresponding proper pre treatment processes is worthy of future investigation the findings of this study will also give us some fundamental ideas of which classes of efom fractions should be removed in the pretreatment process to enhance the removal of trace

14658,electrocoagulation represents a promising process for hardness removal from cooling water nevertheless the slow hydrolysis reaction severely restricted the floc formation inhibiting the hardness co precipitation and simultaneously causing secondary pollution from dissolved al3 inspired by the detrimental membrane fouling phenomenon in conventional electrodialysis we reported a rational strategy to substantially enhance the hardness removal efficiency in electrocoagulation by introducing a special membrane polarization catalyzed h2o dissociation herein leveraging the electron transfer between functional groups so3 and n ch3 3 of ion exchange membrane iem and surface adsorbed h2o under the electric field induced ion depletion scenario h2o dissociation could be effectively catalyzed with this catalytic activity more intensive in so3 than in n ch3 3 such a special h2o dissociation beneficially created a widely distributed and well simulated alkalinity zone around the anodic region of iem which promoted the conversion of dissolved al3 to floc al thereby enhancing floc formation and circumventing secondary pollution all these features enabled the resulting membrane enhanced electrocoagulation meec to achieve a super prominent hardness removal rate of 318 9 g h 1 m 2 with an ultra low specific energy consumption of 3 8 kwh kg 1 caco3 considerably outperforming those of other conventional hardness removal processes reported to date additionally in conjunction with a facile air scoured washing method meec exhibited excellent stability and universal applicability in various reaction conditions graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords electrocoagulation floc formation hardness co precipitation membrane polarization catalyzed h2o dissociation alkalinity zone 1 introduction with the rapid development of various industries cooling water has become a major contributor to industrial wastewater repetitive circulation of this water in the cooling system leads to vaporization which concentrates major hardness ion ca2 leading to problematic scale formation li et al 2011 scale formation substantially lowers the heat transfer efficiency of the cooling system and even blocks pipelines imposing potential risks to industrial production gal et al 2002 the most extensively used methods presently for hardness removal mainly comprise inhibitor addition chemical precipitation coagulation reverse osmosis ro ion exchange electroprecipitation ep and electrocoagulation ec in spite of satisfactory efficacy the addition of the inhibitor which contains considerable phosphates may contribute to severe eutrophication after entering into the receiving water chemical precipitation coagulation is easily operated but it consumes massive chemical reagents which is wasteful prasad et al 2011 ro is efficient under good control but it will produce concentrated water which may cause secondary pollution ion exchange is another alternative but saturated resin should be periodically regenerated by the strong acid base which also produces concentrated water hu et al 2015 turan 2004 ep owns several advantages including environmental friendliness easy operation as well as mild reaction conditions and has received growing interest recently for hardness removal yu et al 2019 nevertheless the hardness removal in ep relies on the cathodic precipitation reaction which means the removal efficiency strongly depends on the cathode area jin et al 2019 in order to ensure adequate efficacy a tremendous electrode area is required which inevitably incurs extremely high investment and huge land occupation by contrast ec is envisaged to be more attractive because it can produce moderate flocs which provide plenty of co precipitation area for hardness removal liberating the hardness removal from the restriction of the cathode area and leading to less investment liao et al 2009 there is a critical weakness however inherent in the conventional ec process due to the slow diffusion of al3 from the anode and continuous evolution of the h2 bubble near the cathode dissolved al3 can barely reach the cathode which means that the floc formation is accomplished virtually via relatively slow hydrolysis reaction rather than direct reaction with the oh produced at the cathode chen et al 2002 this restricts the amounts of flocs produced accordingly lowering the co precipitation efficiency for hardness removal zhi and zhang 2016 to make matters worse the inefficient floc formation will inevitably lead to considerable dissolved al3 remaining in the aqueous solution which in turn increases the risk of secondary pollution membrane polarization is considered to be a detrimental phenomenon in conventional electrodialysis ed lee et al 2013 in pilot or large scale applications the current applied in ed usually has an upper limit beyond which the membrane polarization will prevail such a membrane polarization can induce h2o dissociation and then the produced oh is inclined to chemically precipitate with metal ions and alkalinity ions on the ion exchange membrane iem surface typical as caco3 leading to membrane fouling eventually the selective permeation of other targeted ions such as na cl so4 2 etc is weakened deteriorating the ion separation efficiency therefore to ensure persistent permeation efficiency the current of ed is usually maintained below the trigger value for membrane polarization however this offers us brand new enlightenment if this commonly detrimental phenomenon in ed can be skillfully exploited the inherent issues confronting ec can possibly be resolved as aforementioned membrane polarization induced water dissociation will generate abundant oh which may be beneficial for the floc production process substantially enhancing the co precipitation efficiency for hardness removal better still the promoted formation of floc will simultaneously minimize the dissolved al3 circumventing secondary pollution to the best of our knowledge there are no similar published reports on introducing membrane polarization catalyzed h2o dissociation to enhance ec performance and the mechanism underlying this process has never if ever been investigated in this study we endeavor to overcome the limited co precipitation efficiency of the conventional ec process by introducing a special membrane polarization catalyzed h2o dissociation and this novel process is named membrane enhanced electrocoagulation meec the major aims of this study were to 1 investigate hardness removal performance 2 disclose the mechanism of membrane polarization catalyzed h2o dissociation 3 establish the h2o dissociation modeling 4 assess the stability and superiority of meec 2

calculation and modeling are shown in text s2 3 results and discussion 3 1 hardness removal performance of meec 3 1 1 effect of iem type it is common knowledge that the membrane is the heart of an electrochemical membrane reactor and its property will affect reactor performance based on the consideration above two types of iems i e cem and aem were tested in meec as shown in fig s3 the effluent hardness of meec cem was lower than that of meec aem and their difference enlarged as time prolonged which indicated that the cem enabled meec to have superior performance the removal of the hardness ion was then fitted using a pseudo first order equation text s3 the results indicated the hardness removal in meec well followed the pseudo first order kinetic and the kp were calculated to be 0 16 and 0 12 min 1 for cem and aem respectively fig 1 a this further verified that cem performed better than aem in terms of hardness removal and summarily cem was selected as the optimal iem for use in the subsequent the reason why cem was more efficient than aem was illustrated in section 3 2 3 1 2 effects of operating conditions it is well known that the current density is one of the crucial factors affecting electrochemical reaction thus herein we investigated its effect first chen et al 2000 cid et al 2018 yang et al 2016 y yu et al 2018 as the current density increased the effluent hardness decreased rapidly initially and then decreased slowly fig 1b the initial rapid decrease was mainly attributed to the intensified floc production while the subsequent slow decrease was primarily ascribed to the occurrence of the mass transfer limitation which was explained in text s4 in detail the variation trend of kp was synchronized with that of the effluent hardness fig s4 fig 1b also shows the hardness removal rate hrr which is also a crucial parameter in evaluating the performance of the electrochemical process text s5 consistent with the effluent hardness variation trend hrr increased initially with the current density and nearly reached a plateau thereafter as the current density increased however specific energy consumption sec increased while current efficiency ce decreased text s5 and fig s5 since the flow rate determines the retention time of the solution we evaluated its impact on meec it can be observed clearly from fig 1c that as the flow rate increased effluent hardness increased consecutively in general ec process involves two steps i e destabilization and aggregation the former occurs quickly whereas the latter is relatively more gradual with the increase of the flow rate the aggregation proceeded insufficiently lowering the co precipitation efficiency despite that hrr displayed an ascending trend along with a decrease in sec figs 1c and s5 that was understandable because the volume of the treated solution increased when the flow rate increased increasing the total amount of hardness removal per unit of time to this end there existed a trade off between removal efficiency and treatment capacity considering that the hrr almost reached a plateau after 80 l h 1 fig 1c which indicated the rate determine step changed from mass transfer to interfacial electron transfer thus a flow rate higher than 80 l h 1 was considered to be inappropriate as it barely promoted hrr but only lowered the removal efficiency the ph of the cooling water may vary within a certain range and thus the performance of meec may fluctuate correspondingly fig 1d presents the effluent hardness as a function of influent ph as the influent ph elevated from 5 1 to 9 4 the effluent hardness of meec fell from 281 8 to 209 2 mg l 1 accompanied by the increase of hrr from 45 5 to 93 9 g h 1 m 2 this hardness removal enhancement was associated with the double layer compression in high ph value leading to the stronger floc formation and hardness precipitation tendency as shown in fig 1e an effluent ph increase occurred in low influent ph whereas an effluent ph drop occurred in high influent ph above results indicated that meec could function as a ph neutralizer the ph increase in acidic conditions was the consequence of the following mechanisms first if the solution was acidic the formed floc would tend to react with excess h and then dissolve hence causing the ph increase secondly certain anions such as cl hco3 co3 and so4 2 presented in solution would exchange partially with al oh 3 to release oh which would also result in ph elevation thirdly co2 which was oversaturated in solution under low ph would be released continuously leading to a ph rise conversely the ph decrease in alkaline conditions could be also from the following reasons one of them was co precipitation reinforcement at high ph floc formation and hardness co precipitation could be both accelerated and thus more oh would be consumed giving rise to ph reduction another reason causing the ph decrease was the floc conversion al oh 3 was recognized as a typical amphoteric metal hydroxide and it might at least partially convert to al oh 4 at high ph which again lowered the ph meanwhile with the increase of influent ph sec decreased while ce increased fig s5 overall meec was resistant to the ph variation influent hardness is regarded as another critical factor that can influence the electrochemical reactor performance jin et al 2020 m m tlili et al 2003 2003 y yu et al 2018 as depicted in fig 1f hrr varied almost linearly with the influent hardness accompanied by a decrease in sec and an increase in ce fig s5 the enhanced hardness removal was primarily attributable to the improved mass transfer at high influent hardness considering that the cooling water usually contains a certain concentration of inhibitor the effect of the inhibitor addition on hardness removal was investigated then it can be found that the presence of inhibitor was unfavorable for the hardness removal figs 1g and s5 to further unravel the underlying mechanism the precipitate was analyzed by xps and xrd and modes of action by inhibitor were summarized as follows 1 adsorption effect fig 1h displays the xps survey spectra of the precipitate with the atomic concentrations detailed in table s2 as the inhibitor concentration increased the atomic concentration of ca decreased whereas those of al and p increased generally p was considered as a common element in the inhibitor and the increased p concentration in the precipitate implied that the adsorption of the inhibitor onto flocs was intensified this reduced the number of co precipitation sites on flocs affecting the co precipitation efficiency accordingly 2 lattice distortion effect as shown in fig 1i aside from the gibbsite originating from the al oh 3 caco3 existed as the calcite in crystals precipitated without inhibitor in the presence of the inhibitor however the crystalline form of caco3 was gradually transformed from calcite to aragonite it should be noted here that though calcite and aragonite were both categorized as caco3 the latter was more soluble than the former which meant that a part of the precipitate would redissolve after adding inhibitor additionally it is necessary to point out that in industrial applications the water composition such as influent hardness ph and inhibitor vary from plant to plant and the treatment capacity of our meec can be facilely achieved by adjusting the current density and numbers of iem which indicated the good scalability of meec 3 2 mechanistic insight into membrane polarization catalyzed h2o dissociation in meec 3 2 1 hardness removal pathways in meec hardness removal would be accomplished via multiple routes such as ion exchange ep ec and possible iem induced removal and relative contribution of each part was unknown to disclose the possible mechanism in meec comparative experiments were performed in different processes ion exchange without electricity ep with non sacrificial dsa electrodes ec with al electrodes and without membrane ec fm with al electrodes and filtration membranes fms meec cem with al electrodes and cems and meec aem with al electrodes and aems as depicted in fig 2 a the hardness removal efficiencies via ion exchange were only 0 2 and 2 1 with aem and cem respectively this was understandable because the functional group in cem so3 was capable of exchanging with cation ions whereas that in aem n ch3 3 could only exchange with anion ions as for single ep and ec their hardness removal efficiencies reached 10 3 and 22 6 respectively the better hardness removal obtained in ec would be comprehensible because ep relied in principle exclusively upon the cathodic precipitation reaction while ec produced abundant flocs that could serve as nuclei for hardness ion co precipitation consequently liberating the hardness removal from the restriction of the cathode area nevertheless owing to the limited flocs produced by slow hydrolysis it was difficult to improve hardness removal efficiency of conventional ec any further after the introduction of aem and cem the hardness removal prominently elevated up to 49 5 and 61 4 respectively which robustly evidenced there existed iem induced hardness removal is there any correlation between the removal of hco3 and ca2 during meec process to disclose this potential correlation the δhco3 δca2 in meec was analyzed and the results are shown in fig 2b it was found that the δhco3 and δca2 had a good linearity with δhco3 δca2 being about 1 9 and 2 1 for aem and cem respectively theoretically the concentration of co3 2 was determined by the two step ionization reactions represented by eqs s24 s27 text s7 by further derivation the precipitation reaction equilibrium constant of the caco3 could be written as eq s29 both k1 and k2 were constants c h 2 c o 3 approached constant at the open system where h2co3 could continuously exchange with air and reached a dynamic equilibrium and this was a typical condition in the cooling system let k k 1 c h 2 c o 3 k 2 then eq s29 could be rewritten as 1 k cac o 3 k c c a 2 c hco 3 2 to this end a modified caco3 precipitation reaction equation could be deduced from the obtained caco3 precipitation reaction equilibrium constant 2 c a 2 2 hco 3 cac o 3 h 2 c o 3 although it was an empirical chemical equation the stoichiometric number ratio between ca2 and hco3 indicated that the δhco3 δca2 followed the theoretical ratio of 2 during caco3 precipitation reaction quietly consistent with our experimental results 3 2 2 membrane polarization catalyzed h2o dissociation the specific enhancement mechanism nevertheless still remained indeterminate one plausible reason was that the iem could separate the flocs formed at the anode from the h2 generated at the cathode eliminating the floc retention shortage under the buoyancy of bubbles to validate this speculation an experiment was carried out by substituting a non selective fm for the currently used iem it appears nevertheless ec fm only displayed a 3 3 promotion in hardness removal compared with ec alone fig 2a which was far away from the hardness removal obtained in meec unequivocally ruling out the significant profitable outcome derived from the bubble floc separation for this reason there existed another iem induced removal mechanism and the turbidity in the effluent was first analyzed obviously the turbidity in meec aem and meec cem were 120 4 and 190 5 ntu respectively much higher than those in ec fm 64 8 ntu and ec 60 4 ntu fig 2c denoting that the existence of iem could promote the floc formation thereafter the fate of al was analyzed and three types of speciation floc al dissolved al3 and ion exchanged al could be identified the total al electrolyzed from the anode was calculated based on faraday s law text s8 similar taxonomic distributions were observed between ec and ec fm with dissolved al3 45 0 46 7 and floc al 53 3 54 9 overwhelmingly dominating the al speciation fig 2c notably after introducing iem floc al became increasingly predominant 86 2 and 91 9 for aem and cem respectively while dissolved al3 was less abundant 13 6 and 4 7 for aem and cem respectively revealing that dissolved al3 was converted to floc al under the assistance of iem especially with cem this unequivocally validated that the existence of iem not only could enhance the floc formation but also was beneficial for minimizing the dissolved al3 in the aqueous solution thereby circumventing the potential secondary pollution by further quantitatively calculating the contribution of each route the iem induced removal mechanism accounted for 47 3 and 54 4 of hardness removal in meec aem and meec cem respectively fig 2d elaborating that the iem induced removal played a vital role in meec herein we hypothesized that membrane polarization might be responsible for the enhanced hardness removal in meec to verify this the voltage current curve was conducted three regions could be divided from the voltage current curve according to the slope of the curve which represented the resistance of meec fig 3 a regions 1 and 3 both displayed linearity with stable resistance but the resistance of the latter was smaller than that of the former while transition region 2 displayed curvilinearity with gradually decreased resistance generally ions permeated through iem under the electric field cations anions permeated through cem aem and toward cathode anode and this permeation would be intensified along with the strengthening of the electric field which resulted in an almost linear correlation in region 1 however the diffusion from the bulk solution toward the iem vicinity remained unchanged as such there existed a critical current at which the permeation rate within iem equaled the diffusion rate in the bulk solution if the applied current exceeded the critical value ion permeation would be faster than diffusion this rendered a rapid ion depletion on the surface of iem anodic side for cem cathodic side for aem and therefore catalyzed a membrane polarization there upon membrane polarization h2o would be dissociated into h and oh which was beneficial for gradually reducing the resistance of meec region 2 with the further increase of the current membrane polarization was intensified and became dominant region 3 by intersecting tangents of regions 1 and 3 the critical current density could be obtained and it was estimated to be 115 and 90 a m 2 for aem and cem respectively to uncover the intrinsic reason causing the membrane polarization difference between cem and aem dft calculation was employed to investigate the dissociation ability of h2o the entire processes of h2o dissociation on so3 and n ch3 3 are shown in fig s6 a stronger charge density difference could be found between so3 and interfacial adsorbed h2o 0 22 e than that between n ch3 3 and interfacial adsorbed h2o 0 17 e fig 3b more importantly a much lower activation energy for h2o dissociation could be found in so3 0 23 ev than that in n ch3 3 0 75 ev fig 3c elucidating that cem was more efficient in catalyzing h2o dissociation than aem 3 2 3 mathematical modeling of h2o dissociation subsequently the h oh produced by h2o dissociation permeated through cem aem together with other cations anions and migrated toward the cathode anode to offset the ion permeation deficiency which create an alkalinity around the anodic bulk zone of iem in view of this the interfacial ph at the anodic side of iem was first monitored and it was found that as the current density elevated the interfacial ph at the anodic side of iem increased initially and then almost came to a standstill fig 4 a the maximum interfacial ph at the anodic side of iem could reach 11 7 and 12 5 for aem and cem respectively again proving the superior h2o dissociation capability of cem after understanding the interfacial ph of iem the ph distribution around the whole anodic zone of iem still remained unknown for this reason it is important to explore the h2o dissociation pattern of iem considering that the h2o dissociation at iem and water electrolysis at the cathode were both highly dependent on the applied current it is rational to speculate that there might exist a correlation between those two the interfacial ph at the cathode was calculated according to faraday s and fick s laws text s9 and the experimental results further confirmed that the interfacial ph at the cathode matched the theoretical value fig 4b subsequently the correlation between iem interfacial oh concentration and cathode interfacial oh concentration at a wide range of current density was investigated and the result was well fitted the power function fig 4c by combing such a correlation with faraday s law which was generally used to describe the water electrolysis at the cathode the pattern of h2o dissociation at iem could be well established text s10 3 n oh aem 8 52 1 0 4 i 0 82 i z oh f 4 n oh cem 0 02 i 0 53 i z oh f where noh is the flux of oh mol m 2 s 1 i is the current density a m 2 zoh is the valence of oh f is the faraday constant 96 485 c mol 1 on the basis of the h2o dissociation equation above the ph distribution around the whole anodic zone of iem was modeled before modeling the hydraulic property in meec was investigated first using a tracer pulse experiment with details shown in text s11 from the cumulative residence time distribution crtd curve fig s7 the cumulative tracer displayed a gently increased and widely dispersed feature according to crtd the mean retention time θ dispersive value dv variance σ2 and morrill dispersion index mdi of the tracer could be calculated table s3 θ were calculated to be 7 4 min without current and 7 2 min with current which were less than the theoretical retention time 8 4 min suggesting that part of the tracer outflowed meec ahead of time generally the flow pattern approaches the ideal plug flow as mdi nears 1 while it nears the completely mixed flow as mdi surpasses 3 obviously mdis were as high as 4 5 without current and 6 9 without current respectively revealing that the axial dispersion in the reactor was considerable such a phenomenon was ascribed to the effect of turbulence especially when the current was supplied which electrolyzed water to produce numerous bubbles and thus caused agitation consequently the completely mixed flow was considered as the internal flow pattern in meec and was undertaken in the subsequent simulation fig 4d shows the ph distribution in conventional ec and it was found that the alkalinity zone was located only around the cathode leaving the anodic region remaining neutral this inevitably restricted hardness removal since the floc could be only formed via slow hydrolysis in sharp contrast the presence of iem enabled the alkalinity zone to extend to most of the anodic region fig 4e 4f notably the alkalinity zone distribution was wider and more intensive around the anodic bulk zone of cem than that of aem which was in agreement with the dft results in consequence more oh was available to react with dissolved al3 to form floc which in turn significantly enhanced co precipitation reactions fig 3d and text s6 although there might exist a negative impact caused by al oh 3 al oh 4 conversion the results obtained in fig 4d illustrated that the overall co precipitation reaction was enhanced with the increase of ph which indicated that the negative impact of al oh 3 al oh 4 conversion was minor what needs to be emphasized here is that membrane polarization is a common phenomenon occurred in conventional ed jin et al 2020 it is usually recognized to be detrimental for ed since membrane polarization induced h2o dissociation increases the chemical deposition tendency of ca2 on the surface of iem thus inhibiting the subsequent permeation of other targeted ions such as na cl so4 2 etc therefore the current density of ed was usually maintained below the critical value in real applications to avoid such a detrimental membrane fouling effect but intriguingly herein by applying a current density beyond the critical value membrane polarization was skillfully exploited in meec to generate more floc thus enhancing the hardness removal 3 3 stability and superiority assessment 3 3 1 membrane stability iem is the kernel of meec and its lifetime determines the stability of meec considering the lifetime evaluation is a time consuming procedure in normal conditions the accelerated life test was conducted to exclude the interference caused by the consumption of the al electrode two same dsa electrodes were used herein as shown in fig 5 a the voltage in the absence of iem remained nearly unchanged throughout the entire experiment indicating dsa electrodes maintained undamaged while the voltage in the presence of iem sustained changeless initially and then increased sharply during the last few hours indicating the damage of iem the accelerated service life of iem was defined as working hours when the voltage variation was beyond 5 v as such the accelerated service life of aem and cem were estimated to be 226 and 308 h respectively to decipher the reason for iem damage the functional group in iem was analyzed by ftir in comparison with pristine iem the characteristic peaks of n ch3 3 and so3 became weakened or even faded in damaged aem and cem respectively fig 5b it could be accordingly concluded that the iem damage was the result of functional group destruction it should be noted that the service life of iem was strongly subjected to the applied current generally the lower the current applied the longer the service life for this reason the relationship between service life and current density was explored and it was found that this relationship well followed the power function fig 5c as illustrated below 5 sl 1 i n where n is the coefficient which is 2 2 and 2 4 for aem and cem respectively presuming that the normal current density was 200 a m 2 the service lives of aem and cem were estimated to be approximately 6 5 and 8 8 years 3 3 2 meec operational stability in long term operation there also existed a possibility that a portion of floc would adsorb on the surface of the al electrode or iem the operational stability assessment therefore should be undertaken during the 20 day operation the hardness removal efficiency gradually decreased from 38 3 to 29 2 in meec cem fig 5d in the meantime some precipitate could be clearly observed on the al cathode and cem after 20 days fig s8 a similar deterioration trend could be observed in meec aem fig s9 this robustly evidenced our hypothesis that gradual floc adsorption on the surface of the al electrode or iem caused hardness removal performance deterioration to further decipher this detrimental influence the free corrosion potential of the al electrode was first measured generally the more negative the free corrosion potential is the more rapid the corrosion will be it was found from the tafel polarization diagram that the free corrosion potential of al shifted positively during the 20 day operation fig 5e indicating that the floc adsorption substantially inhibited the electrolysis of al to produce al3 which was unfavorable for subsequent floc formation fig 5f shows the redox cvs of cem obtained in fe cn 6 3 4 redox solution the pristine cem exhibited typical redox response behavior which contained an anodic peak and a corresponding cathodic peak revealing that the pristine cem had reversible selective permeability nonetheless after cem was adsorbed by floc the separation between anodic and cathodic peaks widened indicating the delay of the redox reaction meanwhile the permeation rate of cem decreased from 1 6 to 1 0 μ cm 1 s 1 insert in fig 5f elucidating that the ion selective permeability was gradually restrained as the floc plugged the channels of cem aside from the hardness performance deterioration sec also displayed a gradual increase tendency during the 20 day operation figs 5d and s9 this might be related to the iem resistance increase caused by floc adsorption to this end cv and eis were performed in na2so4 solution clearly a smaller current peak and higher resistance could be found in used cem than those in pristine cem fig 5g 5h which evidenced that the floc adsorption brought about extra resistance likewise the floc adsorption displayed a similar negative effect on the selective permeability and resistance of aem fig s10 in an effort to cope with this problem a facile air scoured washing method was applied for floc detachment the results were encouraging after air scoured washing the al electrode and iem were successfully liberated from floc adsorption fig s8 and the free corrosion potential of air washed al the selective permeability and resistance of air washed iem almost regained their initial value figs 5e 5h and s10 in return the hardness removal and sec of meec showed a responsive recovery figs 5d and s9 these implied that meec could maintain stably under the assistance of periodic air scoured washing 3 3 3 superiority of meec fig 5i compares the hardness removal performance of meec against conventional processes including ec ep ed and ro with detailed information shown in table s4 afonso et al 2004 gabrielli et al 2006 gorni pinkesfeld et al 2013 hasson et al 2008 2011 huang et al 2011 liao et al 2009 shen et al 2016 yu et al 2023 y yu et al 2018 2018 zeppenfeld 2011 zhi and zhang 2016 2014 to make a fair comparison hrr was adopted herein rather than removal efficiency since an almost 100 removal efficiency could be achieved simply by prolonging the retention time fig s3 whereas hrr had an asymptotic limit under different operational conditions furthermore a moderate removal efficiency would be acceptable as the cooling water was repetitively circulated in the cooling system which meant that the cooling water could be repeatedly treated by meec impressively leveraging the special membrane polarization catalyzed h2o dissociation meec displayed significantly higher hrr than aforementioned conventional processes in the meantime although the introduction of iem might append additional resistance to the electrochemical reactor sec of meec was lower than or at least comparable to those of iem free ec and ep which could be attributed in part to the compact structure of the reactor pinpointing that meec was more cost effective than conventional processes for hardness removal 4 conclusions summarily we have developed a rational strategy to substantially enhance the co precipitation efficiency in ec by introducing a special membrane polarization catalyzed h2o dissociation the resulting meec achieved a super prominent hardness removal rate of 318 9 g h 1 m 2 and an ultra low specific energy consumption of 3 8 kwh kg 1 caco3 which all exceeded those of other conventional hardness removal processes reported yet by virtue of the electron transfer between functional groups iem and surface adsorbed h2o under the electric field induced ion depletion h2o dissociation could be effectively catalyzed and so3 in cem was more active than n ch3 3 in aem this special h2o dissociation was favorable for creating a widely distributed and well simulated alkalinity zone around the anodic region of iem which promoted the conversion of dissolved al3 to floc al therefore enhancing floc formation and circumventing secondary pollution furthermore by combing an air scoured washing regeneration method meec featured excellent stability and universal applicability in various reaction conditions this finding highlights the importance of utilizing electroactive membrane catalysis as

14658,electrocoagulation represents a promising process for hardness removal from cooling water nevertheless the slow hydrolysis reaction severely restricted the floc formation inhibiting the hardness co precipitation and simultaneously causing secondary pollution from dissolved al3 inspired by the detrimental membrane fouling phenomenon in conventional electrodialysis we reported a rational strategy to substantially enhance the hardness removal efficiency in electrocoagulation by introducing a special membrane polarization catalyzed h2o dissociation herein leveraging the electron transfer between functional groups so3 and n ch3 3 of ion exchange membrane iem and surface adsorbed h2o under the electric field induced ion depletion scenario h2o dissociation could be effectively catalyzed with this catalytic activity more intensive in so3 than in n ch3 3 such a special h2o dissociation beneficially created a widely distributed and well simulated alkalinity zone around the anodic region of iem which promoted the conversion of dissolved al3 to floc al thereby enhancing floc formation and circumventing secondary pollution all these features enabled the resulting membrane enhanced electrocoagulation meec to achieve a super prominent hardness removal rate of 318 9 g h 1 m 2 with an ultra low specific energy consumption of 3 8 kwh kg 1 caco3 considerably outperforming those of other conventional hardness removal processes reported to date additionally in conjunction with a facile air scoured washing method meec exhibited excellent stability and universal applicability in various reaction conditions graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords electrocoagulation floc formation hardness co precipitation membrane polarization catalyzed h2o dissociation alkalinity zone 1 introduction with the rapid development of various industries cooling water has become a major contributor to industrial wastewater repetitive circulation of this water in the cooling system leads to vaporization which concentrates major hardness ion ca2 leading to problematic scale formation li et al 2011 scale formation substantially lowers the heat transfer efficiency of the cooling system and even blocks pipelines imposing potential risks to industrial production gal et al 2002 the most extensively used methods presently for hardness removal mainly comprise inhibitor addition chemical precipitation coagulation reverse osmosis ro ion exchange electroprecipitation ep and electrocoagulation ec in spite of satisfactory efficacy the addition of the inhibitor which contains considerable phosphates may contribute to severe eutrophication after entering into the receiving water chemical precipitation coagulation is easily operated but it consumes massive chemical reagents which is wasteful prasad et al 2011 ro is efficient under good control but it will produce concentrated water which may cause secondary pollution ion exchange is another alternative but saturated resin should be periodically regenerated by the strong acid base which also produces concentrated water hu et al 2015 turan 2004 ep owns several advantages including environmental friendliness easy operation as well as mild reaction conditions and has received growing interest recently for hardness removal yu et al 2019 nevertheless the hardness removal in ep relies on the cathodic precipitation reaction which means the removal efficiency strongly depends on the cathode area jin et al 2019 in order to ensure adequate efficacy a tremendous electrode area is required which inevitably incurs extremely high investment and huge land occupation by contrast ec is envisaged to be more attractive because it can produce moderate flocs which provide plenty of co precipitation area for hardness removal liberating the hardness removal from the restriction of the cathode area and leading to less investment liao et al 2009 there is a critical weakness however inherent in the conventional ec process due to the slow diffusion of al3 from the anode and continuous evolution of the h2 bubble near the cathode dissolved al3 can barely reach the cathode which means that the floc formation is accomplished virtually via relatively slow hydrolysis reaction rather than direct reaction with the oh produced at the cathode chen et al 2002 this restricts the amounts of flocs produced accordingly lowering the co precipitation efficiency for hardness removal zhi and zhang 2016 to make matters worse the inefficient floc formation will inevitably lead to considerable dissolved al3 remaining in the aqueous solution which in turn increases the risk of secondary pollution membrane polarization is considered to be a detrimental phenomenon in conventional electrodialysis ed lee et al 2013 in pilot or large scale applications the current applied in ed usually has an upper limit beyond which the membrane polarization will prevail such a membrane polarization can induce h2o dissociation and then the produced oh is inclined to chemically precipitate with metal ions and alkalinity ions on the ion exchange membrane iem surface typical as caco3 leading to membrane fouling eventually the selective permeation of other targeted ions such as na cl so4 2 etc is weakened deteriorating the ion separation efficiency therefore to ensure persistent permeation efficiency the current of ed is usually maintained below the trigger value for membrane polarization however this offers us brand new enlightenment if this commonly detrimental phenomenon in ed can be skillfully exploited the inherent issues confronting ec can possibly be resolved as aforementioned membrane polarization induced water dissociation will generate abundant oh which may be beneficial for the floc production process substantially enhancing the co precipitation efficiency for hardness removal better still the promoted formation of floc will simultaneously minimize the dissolved al3 circumventing secondary pollution to the best of our knowledge there are no similar published reports on introducing membrane polarization catalyzed h2o dissociation to enhance ec performance and the mechanism underlying this process has never if ever been investigated in this study we endeavor to overcome the limited co precipitation efficiency of the conventional ec process by introducing a special membrane polarization catalyzed h2o dissociation and this novel process is named membrane enhanced electrocoagulation meec the major aims of this study were to 1 investigate hardness removal performance 2 disclose the mechanism of membrane polarization catalyzed h2o dissociation 3 establish the h2o dissociation modeling 4 assess the stability and superiority of meec 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental setup fig s1 shows the schematic diagram of the experimental setup the reactor with a volume of 1 4 l had a lower left inlet and an upper right outlet ep ec and meec were derived from the same reactor for ec or ep six iem free aluminum al or dsa electrodes were fixed in the reactor while for meec six al electrodes and five cation exchange membranes cems anion exchange membranes aems with the same dimension were alternately fixed in the reactor the detail of iem could be found in table s1 all electrodes which were connected in the dipolar mode had dimension

the insulating barrier the required electrode area reactor volume in the current experimental setup was calculated to be 0 43 cm 1 and the required electrode area reactor volume could be further enlarged by shortening the electrode gap the hydraulic property of meec was evaluated by a tracer pulse test in the test 2 g of na2so4 which served as the tracer was pumped into meec and the effluent

calculation and modeling are shown in text s2 3 results and discussion 3 1 hardness removal performance of meec 3 1 1 effect of iem type it is common knowledge that the membrane is the heart of an electrochemical membrane reactor and its property will affect reactor performance based on the consideration above two types of iems i e cem and aem were tested in meec as shown in fig s3 the effluent hardness of meec cem was lower than that of meec aem and their difference enlarged as time prolonged which indicated that the cem enabled meec to have superior performance the removal of the hardness ion was then fitted using a pseudo first order equation text s3 the results indicated the hardness removal in meec well followed the pseudo first order kinetic and the kp were calculated to be 0 16 and 0 12 min 1 for cem and aem respectively fig 1 a this further verified that cem performed better than aem in terms of hardness removal and summarily cem was selected as the optimal iem for use in the subsequent the reason why cem was more efficient than aem was illustrated in section 3 2 3 1 2 effects of operating conditions it is well known that the current density is one of the crucial factors affecting electrochemical reaction thus herein we investigated its effect first chen et al 2000 cid et al 2018 yang et al 2016 y yu et al 2018 as the current density increased the effluent hardness decreased rapidly initially and then decreased slowly fig 1b the initial rapid decrease was mainly attributed to the intensified floc production while the subsequent slow decrease was primarily ascribed to the occurrence of the mass transfer limitation which was explained in text s4 in detail the variation trend of kp was synchronized with that of the effluent hardness fig s4 fig 1b also shows the hardness removal rate hrr which is also a crucial parameter in evaluating the performance of the electrochemical process text s5 consistent with the effluent hardness variation trend hrr increased initially with the current density and nearly reached a plateau thereafter as the current density increased however specific energy consumption sec increased while current efficiency ce decreased text s5 and fig s5 since the flow rate determines the retention time of the solution we evaluated its impact on meec it can be observed clearly from fig 1c that as the flow rate increased effluent hardness increased consecutively in general ec process involves two steps i e destabilization and aggregation the former occurs quickly whereas the latter is relatively more gradual with the increase of the flow rate the aggregation proceeded insufficiently lowering the co precipitation efficiency despite that hrr displayed an ascending trend along with a decrease in sec figs 1c and s5 that was understandable because the volume of the treated solution increased when the flow rate increased increasing the total amount of hardness removal per unit of time to this end there existed a trade off between removal efficiency and treatment capacity considering that the hrr almost reached a plateau after 80 l h 1 fig 1c which indicated the rate determine step changed from mass transfer to interfacial electron transfer thus a flow rate higher than 80 l h 1 was considered to be inappropriate as it barely promoted hrr but only lowered the removal efficiency the ph of the cooling water may vary within a certain range and thus the performance of meec may fluctuate correspondingly fig 1d presents the effluent hardness as a function of influent ph as the influent ph elevated from 5 1 to 9 4 the effluent hardness of meec fell from 281 8 to 209 2 mg l 1 accompanied by the increase of hrr from 45 5 to 93 9 g h 1 m 2 this hardness removal enhancement was associated with the double layer compression in high ph value leading to the stronger floc formation and hardness precipitation tendency as shown in fig 1e an effluent ph increase occurred in low influent ph whereas an effluent ph drop occurred in high influent ph above results indicated that meec could function as a ph neutralizer the ph increase in acidic conditions was the consequence of the following mechanisms first if the solution was acidic the formed floc would tend to react with excess h and then dissolve hence causing the ph increase secondly certain anions such as cl hco3 co3 and so4 2 presented in solution would exchange partially with al oh 3 to release oh which would also result in ph elevation thirdly co2 which was oversaturated in solution under low ph would be released continuously leading to a ph rise conversely the ph decrease in alkaline conditions could be also from the following reasons one of them was co precipitation reinforcement at high ph floc formation and hardness co precipitation could be both accelerated and thus more oh would be consumed giving rise to ph reduction another reason causing the ph decrease was the floc conversion al oh 3 was recognized as a typical amphoteric metal hydroxide and it might at least partially convert to al oh 4 at high ph which again lowered the ph meanwhile with the increase of influent ph sec decreased while ce increased fig s5 overall meec was resistant to the ph variation influent hardness is regarded as another critical factor that can influence the electrochemical reactor performance jin et al 2020 m m tlili et al 2003 2003 y yu et al 2018 as depicted in fig 1f hrr varied almost linearly with the influent hardness accompanied by a decrease in sec and an increase in ce fig s5 the enhanced hardness removal was primarily attributable to the improved mass transfer at high influent hardness considering that the cooling water usually contains a certain concentration of inhibitor the effect of the inhibitor addition on hardness removal was investigated then it can be found that the presence of inhibitor was unfavorable for the hardness removal figs 1g and s5 to further unravel the underlying mechanism the precipitate was analyzed by xps and xrd and modes of action by inhibitor were summarized as follows 1 adsorption effect fig 1h displays the xps survey spectra of the precipitate with the atomic concentrations detailed in table s2 as the inhibitor concentration increased the atomic concentration of ca decreased whereas those of al and p increased generally p was considered as a common element in the inhibitor and the increased p concentration in the precipitate implied that the adsorption of the inhibitor onto flocs was intensified this reduced the number of co precipitation sites on flocs affecting the co precipitation efficiency accordingly 2 lattice distortion effect as shown in fig 1i aside from the gibbsite originating from the al oh 3 caco3 existed as the calcite in crystals precipitated without inhibitor in the presence of the inhibitor however the crystalline form of caco3 was gradually transformed from calcite to aragonite it should be noted here that though calcite and aragonite were both categorized as caco3 the latter was more soluble than the former which meant that a part of the precipitate would redissolve after adding inhibitor additionally it is necessary to point out that in industrial applications the water composition such as influent hardness ph and inhibitor vary from plant to plant and the treatment capacity of our meec can be facilely achieved by adjusting the current density and numbers of iem which indicated the good scalability of meec 3 2 mechanistic insight into membrane polarization catalyzed h2o dissociation in meec 3 2 1 hardness removal pathways in meec hardness removal would be accomplished via multiple routes such as ion exchange ep ec and possible iem induced removal and relative contribution of each part was unknown to disclose the possible mechanism in meec comparative experiments were performed in different processes ion exchange without electricity ep with non sacrificial dsa electrodes ec with al electrodes and without membrane ec fm with al electrodes and filtration membranes fms meec cem with al electrodes and cems and meec aem with al electrodes and aems as depicted in fig 2 a the hardness removal efficiencies via ion exchange were only 0 2 and 2 1 with aem and cem respectively this was understandable because the functional group in cem so3 was capable of exchanging with cation ions whereas that in aem n ch3 3 could only exchange with anion ions as for single ep and ec their hardness removal efficiencies reached 10 3 and 22 6 respectively the better hardness removal obtained in ec would be comprehensible because ep relied in principle exclusively upon the cathodic precipitation reaction while ec produced abundant flocs that could serve as nuclei for hardness ion co precipitation consequently liberating the hardness removal from the restriction of the cathode area nevertheless owing to the limited flocs produced by slow hydrolysis it was difficult to improve hardness removal efficiency of conventional ec any further after the introduction of aem and cem the hardness removal prominently elevated up to 49 5 and 61 4 respectively which robustly evidenced there existed iem induced hardness removal is there any correlation between the removal of hco3 and ca2 during meec process to disclose this potential correlation the δhco3 δca2 in meec was analyzed and the results are shown in fig 2b it was found that the δhco3 and δca2 had a good linearity with δhco3 δca2 being about 1 9 and 2 1 for aem and cem respectively theoretically the concentration of co3 2 was determined by the two step ionization reactions represented by eqs s24 s27 text s7 by further derivation the precipitation reaction equilibrium constant of the caco3 could be written as eq s29 both k1 and k2 were constants c h 2 c o 3 approached constant at the open system where h2co3 could continuously exchange with air and reached a dynamic equilibrium and this was a typical condition in the cooling system let k k 1 c h 2 c o 3 k 2 then eq s29 could be rewritten as 1 k cac o 3 k c c a 2 c hco 3 2 to this end a modified caco3 precipitation reaction equation could be deduced from the obtained caco3 precipitation reaction equilibrium constant 2 c a 2 2 hco 3 cac o 3 h 2 c o 3 although it was an empirical chemical equation the stoichiometric number ratio between ca2 and hco3 indicated that the δhco3 δca2 followed the theoretical ratio of 2 during caco3 precipitation reaction quietly consistent with our experimental results 3 2 2 membrane polarization catalyzed h2o dissociation the specific enhancement mechanism nevertheless still remained indeterminate one plausible reason was that the iem could separate the flocs formed at the anode from the h2 generated at the cathode eliminating the floc retention shortage under the buoyancy of bubbles to validate this speculation an experiment was carried out by substituting a non selective fm for the currently used iem it appears nevertheless ec fm only displayed a 3 3 promotion in hardness removal compared with ec alone fig 2a which was far away from the hardness removal obtained in meec unequivocally ruling out the significant profitable outcome derived from the bubble floc separation for this reason there existed another iem induced removal mechanism and the turbidity in the effluent was first analyzed obviously the turbidity in meec aem and meec cem were 120 4 and 190 5 ntu respectively much higher than those in ec fm 64 8 ntu and ec 60 4 ntu fig 2c denoting that the existence of iem could promote the floc formation thereafter the fate of al was analyzed and three types of speciation floc al dissolved al3 and ion exchanged al could be identified the total al electrolyzed from the anode was calculated based on faraday s law text s8 similar taxonomic distributions were observed between ec and ec fm with dissolved al3 45 0 46 7 and floc al 53 3 54 9 overwhelmingly dominating the al speciation fig 2c notably after introducing iem floc al became increasingly predominant 86 2 and 91 9 for aem and cem respectively while dissolved al3 was less abundant 13 6 and 4 7 for aem and cem respectively revealing that dissolved al3 was converted to floc al under the assistance of iem especially with cem this unequivocally validated that the existence of iem not only could enhance the floc formation but also was beneficial for minimizing the dissolved al3 in the aqueous solution thereby circumventing the potential secondary pollution by further quantitatively calculating the contribution of each route the iem induced removal mechanism accounted for 47 3 and 54 4 of hardness removal in meec aem and meec cem respectively fig 2d elaborating that the iem induced removal played a vital role in meec herein we hypothesized that membrane polarization might be responsible for the enhanced hardness removal in meec to verify this the voltage current curve was conducted three regions could be divided from the voltage current curve according to the slope of the curve which represented the resistance of meec fig 3 a regions 1 and 3 both displayed linearity with stable resistance but the resistance of the latter was smaller than that of the former while transition region 2 displayed curvilinearity with gradually decreased resistance generally ions permeated through iem under the electric field cations anions permeated through cem aem and toward cathode anode and this permeation would be intensified along with the strengthening of the electric field which resulted in an almost linear correlation in region 1 however the diffusion from the bulk solution toward the iem vicinity remained unchanged as such there existed a critical current at which the permeation rate within iem equaled the diffusion rate in the bulk solution if the applied current exceeded the critical value ion permeation would be faster than diffusion this rendered a rapid ion depletion on the surface of iem anodic side for cem cathodic side for aem and therefore catalyzed a membrane polarization there upon membrane polarization h2o would be dissociated into h and oh which was beneficial for gradually reducing the resistance of meec region 2 with the further increase of the current membrane polarization was intensified and became dominant region 3 by intersecting tangents of regions 1 and 3 the critical current density could be obtained and it was estimated to be 115 and 90 a m 2 for aem and cem respectively to uncover the intrinsic reason causing the membrane polarization difference between cem and aem dft calculation was employed to investigate the dissociation ability of h2o the entire processes of h2o dissociation on so3 and n ch3 3 are shown in fig s6 a stronger charge density difference could be found between so3 and interfacial adsorbed h2o 0 22 e than that between n ch3 3 and interfacial adsorbed h2o 0 17 e fig 3b more importantly a much lower activation energy for h2o dissociation could be found in so3 0 23 ev than that in n ch3 3 0 75 ev fig 3c elucidating that cem was more efficient in catalyzing h2o dissociation than aem 3 2 3 mathematical modeling of h2o dissociation subsequently the h oh produced by h2o dissociation permeated through cem aem together with other cations anions and migrated toward the cathode anode to offset the ion permeation deficiency which create an alkalinity around the anodic bulk zone of iem in view of this the interfacial ph at the anodic side of iem was first monitored and it was found that as the current density elevated the interfacial ph at the anodic side of iem increased initially and then almost came to a standstill fig 4 a the maximum interfacial ph at the anodic side of iem could reach 11 7 and 12 5 for aem and cem respectively again proving the superior h2o dissociation capability of cem after understanding the interfacial ph of iem the ph distribution around the whole anodic zone of iem still remained unknown for this reason it is important to explore the h2o dissociation pattern of iem considering that the h2o dissociation at iem and water electrolysis at the cathode were both highly dependent on the applied current it is rational to speculate that there might exist a correlation between those two the interfacial ph at the cathode was calculated according to faraday s and fick s laws text s9 and the experimental results further confirmed that the interfacial ph at the cathode matched the theoretical value fig 4b subsequently the correlation between iem interfacial oh concentration and cathode interfacial oh concentration at a wide range of current density was investigated and the result was well fitted the power function fig 4c by combing such a correlation with faraday s law which was generally used to describe the water electrolysis at the cathode the pattern of h2o dissociation at iem could be well established text s10 3 n oh aem 8 52 1 0 4 i 0 82 i z oh f 4 n oh cem 0 02 i 0 53 i z oh f where noh is the flux of oh mol m 2 s 1 i is the current density a m 2 zoh is the valence of oh f is the faraday constant 96 485 c mol 1 on the basis of the h2o dissociation equation above the ph distribution around the whole anodic zone of iem was modeled before modeling the hydraulic property in meec was investigated first using a tracer pulse experiment with details shown in text s11 from the cumulative residence time distribution crtd curve fig s7 the cumulative tracer displayed a gently increased and widely dispersed feature according to crtd the mean retention time θ dispersive value dv variance σ2 and morrill dispersion index mdi of the tracer could be calculated table s3 θ were calculated to be 7 4 min without current and 7 2 min with current which were less than the theoretical retention time 8 4 min suggesting that part of the tracer outflowed meec ahead of time generally the flow pattern approaches the ideal plug flow as mdi nears 1 while it nears the completely mixed flow as mdi surpasses 3 obviously mdis were as high as 4 5 without current and 6 9 without current respectively revealing that the axial dispersion in the reactor was considerable such a phenomenon was ascribed to the effect of turbulence especially when the current was supplied which electrolyzed water to produce numerous bubbles and thus caused agitation consequently the completely mixed flow was considered as the internal flow pattern in meec and was undertaken in the subsequent simulation fig 4d shows the ph distribution in conventional ec and it was found that the alkalinity zone was located only around the cathode leaving the anodic region remaining neutral this inevitably restricted hardness removal since the floc could be only formed via slow hydrolysis in sharp contrast the presence of iem enabled the alkalinity zone to extend to most of the anodic region fig 4e 4f notably the alkalinity zone distribution was wider and more intensive around the anodic bulk zone of cem than that of aem which was in agreement with the dft results in consequence more oh was available to react with dissolved al3 to form floc which in turn significantly enhanced co precipitation reactions fig 3d and text s6 although there might exist a negative impact caused by al oh 3 al oh 4 conversion the results obtained in fig 4d illustrated that the overall co precipitation reaction was enhanced with the increase of ph which indicated that the negative impact of al oh 3 al oh 4 conversion was minor what needs to be emphasized here is that membrane polarization is a common phenomenon occurred in conventional ed jin et al 2020 it is usually recognized to be detrimental for ed since membrane polarization induced h2o dissociation increases the chemical deposition tendency of ca2 on the surface of iem thus inhibiting the subsequent permeation of other targeted ions such as na cl so4 2 etc therefore the current density of ed was usually maintained below the critical value in real applications to avoid such a detrimental membrane fouling effect but intriguingly herein by applying a current density beyond the critical value membrane polarization was skillfully exploited in meec to generate more floc thus enhancing the hardness removal 3 3 stability and superiority assessment 3 3 1 membrane stability iem is the kernel of meec and its lifetime determines the stability of meec considering the lifetime evaluation is a time consuming procedure in normal conditions the accelerated life test was conducted to exclude the interference caused by the consumption of the al electrode two same dsa electrodes were used herein as shown in fig 5 a the voltage in the absence of iem remained nearly unchanged throughout the entire experiment indicating dsa electrodes maintained undamaged while the voltage in the presence of iem sustained changeless initially and then increased sharply during the last few hours indicating the damage of iem the accelerated service life of iem was defined as working hours when the voltage variation was beyond 5 v as such the accelerated service life of aem and cem were estimated to be 226 and 308 h respectively to decipher the reason for iem damage the functional group in iem was analyzed by ftir in comparison with pristine iem the characteristic peaks of n ch3 3 and so3 became weakened or even faded in damaged aem and cem respectively fig 5b it could be accordingly concluded that the iem damage was the result of functional group destruction it should be noted that the service life of iem was strongly subjected to the applied current generally the lower the current applied the longer the service life for this reason the relationship between service life and current density was explored and it was found that this relationship well followed the power function fig 5c as illustrated below 5 sl 1 i n where n is the coefficient which is 2 2 and 2 4 for aem and cem respectively presuming that the normal current density was 200 a m 2 the service lives of aem and cem were estimated to be approximately 6 5 and 8 8 years 3 3 2 meec operational stability in long term operation there also existed a possibility that a portion of floc would adsorb on the surface of the al electrode or iem the operational stability assessment therefore should be undertaken during the 20 day operation the hardness removal efficiency gradually decreased from 38 3 to 29 2 in meec cem fig 5d in the meantime some precipitate could be clearly observed on the al cathode and cem after 20 days fig s8 a similar deterioration trend could be observed in meec aem fig s9 this robustly evidenced our hypothesis that gradual floc adsorption on the surface of the al electrode or iem caused hardness removal performance deterioration to further decipher this detrimental influence the free corrosion potential of the al electrode was first measured generally the more negative the free corrosion potential is the more rapid the corrosion will be it was found from the tafel polarization diagram that the free corrosion potential of al shifted positively during the 20 day operation fig 5e indicating that the floc adsorption substantially inhibited the electrolysis of al to produce al3 which was unfavorable for subsequent floc formation fig 5f shows the redox cvs of cem obtained in fe cn 6 3 4 redox solution the pristine cem exhibited typical redox response behavior which contained an anodic peak and a corresponding cathodic peak revealing that the pristine cem had reversible selective permeability nonetheless after cem was adsorbed by floc the separation between anodic and cathodic peaks widened indicating the delay of the redox reaction meanwhile the permeation rate of cem decreased from 1 6 to 1 0 μ cm 1 s 1 insert in fig 5f elucidating that the ion selective permeability was gradually restrained as the floc plugged the channels of cem aside from the hardness performance deterioration sec also displayed a gradual increase tendency during the 20 day operation figs 5d and s9 this might be related to the iem resistance increase caused by floc adsorption to this end cv and eis were performed in na2so4 solution clearly a smaller current peak and higher resistance could be found in used cem than those in pristine cem fig 5g 5h which evidenced that the floc adsorption brought about extra resistance likewise the floc adsorption displayed a similar negative effect on the selective permeability and resistance of aem fig s10 in an effort to cope with this problem a facile air scoured washing method was applied for floc detachment the results were encouraging after air scoured washing the al electrode and iem were successfully liberated from floc adsorption fig s8 and the free corrosion potential of air washed al the selective permeability and resistance of air washed iem almost regained their initial value figs 5e 5h and s10 in return the hardness removal and sec of meec showed a responsive recovery figs 5d and s9 these implied that meec could maintain stably under the assistance of periodic air scoured washing 3 3 3 superiority of meec fig 5i compares the hardness removal performance of meec against conventional processes including ec ep ed and ro with detailed information shown in table s4 afonso et al 2004 gabrielli et al 2006 gorni pinkesfeld et al 2013 hasson et al 2008 2011 huang et al 2011 liao et al 2009 shen et al 2016 yu et al 2023 y yu et al 2018 2018 zeppenfeld 2011 zhi and zhang 2016 2014 to make a fair comparison hrr was adopted herein rather than removal efficiency since an almost 100 removal efficiency could be achieved simply by prolonging the retention time fig s3 whereas hrr had an asymptotic limit under different operational conditions furthermore a moderate removal efficiency would be acceptable as the cooling water was repetitively circulated in the cooling system which meant that the cooling water could be repeatedly treated by meec impressively leveraging the special membrane polarization catalyzed h2o dissociation meec displayed significantly higher hrr than aforementioned conventional processes in the meantime although the introduction of iem might append additional resistance to the electrochemical reactor sec of meec was lower than or at least comparable to those of iem free ec and ep which could be attributed in part to the compact structure of the reactor pinpointing that meec was more cost effective than conventional processes for hardness removal 4 conclusions summarily we have developed a rational strategy to substantially enhance the co precipitation efficiency in ec by introducing a special membrane polarization catalyzed h2o dissociation the resulting meec achieved a super prominent hardness removal rate of 318 9 g h 1 m 2 and an ultra low specific energy consumption of 3 8 kwh kg 1 caco3 which all exceeded those of other conventional hardness removal processes reported yet by virtue of the electron transfer between functional groups iem and surface adsorbed h2o under the electric field induced ion depletion h2o dissociation could be effectively catalyzed and so3 in cem was more active than n ch3 3 in aem this special h2o dissociation was favorable for creating a widely distributed and well simulated alkalinity zone around the anodic region of iem which promoted the conversion of dissolved al3 to floc al therefore enhancing floc formation and circumventing secondary pollution furthermore by combing an air scoured washing regeneration method meec featured excellent stability and universal applicability in various reaction conditions this finding highlights the importance of utilizing electroactive membrane catalysis as

14659,ammonia is a major inhibitor in anaerobic digestion of nitrogen rich organic wastes in this study integrated genome centric metagenomic and metaproteomic analyses were used to identify the key microorganisms and metabolic links causing instability by characterizing the process performance microbial community and metabolic responses of key microorganisms during endogenous ammonia accumulation the identification of 89 metagenome assembled genomes and analysis of their abundance profile in different operational phases permitted the identification of key taxa firmicutes and proteobacteria causing poor performance metabolic reconstruction indicated that the key taxa had the genetic potential to participate in the metabolism of c2 c5 volatile fatty acids vfas further investigation suggested that during phase i the total ammonia nitrogen tan level was maintained below 2000 mg n l and the reactor showed a high methane yield 478 30 33 35 ml g vs and low vfas concentration when the tan accumulated to 2000 mg n l acid accumulation mainly of acetate began to occur and the methane yield gradually decreased to 330 44 ml g vs phase ii during this phase the vfa degradation functions of the community were mainly mediated by firmicutes approximately 61 54 of significant differentially expressed proteins deps related to acetate metabolism in firmicutes were down regulated which led to an increase in acetate concentration to 4897 91 1558 96 mg l however the reactor performance showed spontaneous recovery without any interference phase iii during which firmicutes gradually adapted to the high ammonia conditions approximately 75 of the significant deps related to acetate metabolism of proteobacteria were also up regulated in phase iii compared with phase ii thus vfa related metabolic functions of the community were enhanced which resulted in a decrease in the total vfa concentration to 195 39 mg l when the tan increased above 4000 mg n l the system gradually showed acid accumulation dominated by propionate accompanied by a second decrease in methane yield phase iv during this phase the number of up regulated and down regulated proteins related to acetate metabolism of firmicutes and butyrate valerate metabolism of proteobacteria was comparable with that of phase iii indicating that the metabolic functions related to acetate butyrate and valerate of the microbial community were not significantly affected however for propionate metabolism the expression activity of fumarate hydratase from firmicutes and proteobacteria was severely inhibited by ammonia as shown by down regulation ratios of 63 64 and 85 71 respectively no protein with the same function that was not inhibited by ammonia could be detected and the fumarate degradation function of the microbial community was severely damaged leading to blocked propionate metabolism and irreversible deterioration of reactor performance this study has provided a new perspective on the microecological mechanisms of ammonia inhibition graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords anaerobic digestion ammonia inhibition metagenome assembled genomes metaproteomics data availability the authors are unable or have chosen not to specify which data has been used 1 introduction food waste fw is one of the world s largest waste streams in 2020 125 million tons of fw were generated in china zhu et al 2022a because fw is rich in organic matter anaerobic digestion ad is considered the most suitable technology for treating fw cheng et al 2020 however fw has a high protein content and approximately 33 80 of the proteins and amino acids in fw are degraded to ammonia nitrogen thus ammonia can easily accumulate during the ad process palakodeti et al 2021 ammonia nitrogen mainly exists as free ammonia and ammonium ions free ammonia can penetrate the cell membrane of microorganisms and result in proton imbalances alterations in intracellular ph decreases in the efficiency of enzymatic reactions and increases in the energy required for cell maintenance palakodeti et al 2021 ammonium ions have direct negative effects on the activity of enzymes in anaerobes e g acetyl coa decarbonylase and methyl coenzyme m reductase zhu et al 2022b therefore high concentrations of ammonia nitrogen can negatively influence the performance of ad systems resulting in decreased methane production foaming and even process failure in commercial biogas plants yang et al 2022 various approaches have been used to alleviate ammonia inhibition such as reducing the ammonia concentration e g co digestion zhang et al 2019 and ammonia stripping palakodeti et al 2021 and improving ammonia tolerance e g use of additives yan et al 2020a bioaugmentation li et al 2022 and innovative light assisted bioreactors zhu et al 2022b however the issue of ammonia inhibition has never been fundamentally solved some reactors still showed signs of ammonia inhibition at low concentrations 3000 mg n l even after bioaugmentation of syntrophic acetate oxidizing co cultures fotidis et al 2013 in contrast there are also some reactors with satisfactory methane yield with ammonia concentrations as high as 7250 mg n l yan et al 2020b therefore the mechanism of ammonia inhibition requires further investigation considering that microorganisms are the main functional body in the ad system the fundamental reason for the aforementioned contrasting phenomena primarily lies in differences in microorganisms among systems ad reactors have long been considered as black boxes in recent years omics technologies have gained rapid development for example 16s rrna gene sequencing has permitted high resolution taxonomic analyses of microbial communities zhang et al 2020 gene centric metagenomic sequencing can be used to comprehensively analyze the functions and metabolic pathways of microbial communities li et al 2020 metaproteomic sequencing can be used to characterize protein expression profiles of microbial communities and provide direct evidence of microbial metabolic functions heyer et al 2019 a small number of studies have recently used integrated gene centric metagenomic and metaproteomic sequencing to investigate differences in active microorganisms and the expression of functional proteins between the steady state phase and ammonia induced instability phase in ad reactors zhang et al 2022 liu et al 2021 by contrast genome centric metagenomic approaches can be used to identify metagenome assembled genomes mags through the binning of assembled contigs which can permit the functional traits of individual species to be extracted from complex communities without relying on extant databases and pure culture techniques zhu et al 2019 this approach combined with metaproteomic analysis of the mag activity response can clarify the underlying causes of changes in key mags however few studies have used integrated genome centric metagenomic and metaproteomic analyses to elucidate the responses of the microbial community to ammonia stress in ad system here the responses of the microbial community to ammonia stress during the stability instability recovery secondary instability process during endogenous ammonia accumulation in the fw ad system were explored specifically metagenomic binning was used to recover near complete mags from complex microbial communities the resulting mags were used to manually reconstruct the metabolic pathways of the genomes and then used as a reference platform to analyze the protein expression profiles of the genomes the objectives of this study were to clarify ammonia shaped interspecies interactions and niche differentiation identify the key metabolic links and microorganisms affecting ad performance under ammonia stress and elucidate the metabolic activity response patterns of key microorganisms this study provides new insights that will help optimize the ad process of nitrogen rich wastes 2 material and methods 2 1 substrate and inoculum synthetic high protein fw was made in one batch which contains vegetable meat rice and vegetable oil and the wet based mass ratio of these components was 39 16 44 1 the purpose of using synthetic high protein fw was to avoid excessive fat content of the substrate ensure that ammonia was the only disturbance factor and ensure the uniformity of the substrate and reproducibility of the experimental results zhang et al 2022 before use the substrate was kept in a freezer at 20 c the inoculum was taken from a biogas digester in chongqing and the retrieved sludge was first filtered to remove coarse impurities the filtered sludge was then pre incubated to consume the residual organic matter until the biogas production stopped completely finally the sludge was domesticated to facilitate adaptation to the fw the physicochemical properties of the substrate and inoculum are shown in table s1 2 2 experimental setup and operation the anaerobic digester was operated in a semi continuous mode at 37 1 c the top of the reactor was equipped with a stirring motor at a speed of 100 r min and with a 2 h interval for every 4 h of stirring the organic loading rate and hydraulic retention time were set at 2 5 g vs l d and 40 d respectively during the experiment with daily feeding endogenous ammonia accumulation was induced with synthetic high protein fw and the reactor experienced a process of stability instability phase i and ii natural recovery phase iii of system performance was observed after continuous operation at 106 d of operation a second decrease in methane yield was observed thus the reactor experienced a process of secondary instability phase iv by 120 d operation of the reactor ceased due to a laboratory lockdown caused by the covid 19 pandemic 2 3 chemical analysis before the experiment the ph total solids volatile solids as well as the carbon hydrogen oxygen nitrogen protein fat and carbohydrate contents of the substrate were determined after the start of the experiment the biogas volume and composition were measured daily eight ml of sludge was collected daily for measurements of total

calculate the significance p value of differences between samples significant differentially expressed proteins deps were identified using the following criteria fold change 2 or 0 5 and p 0 05 the ratio of up regulated down regulated proteins refers to the percentage of the number of up regulated down regulated proteins to the total number of up regulated and down regulated proteins 3 results and discussion 3 1 effects of ammonia on ad performance fig 1 shows the response of the reactor performance parameters to ammonia stress the whole experimental period was divided into four phases based on the methane yield in phase i 0 40 d synthetic high protein fw was degraded tan in the reactor increased from 816 34 119 mg n l to 1912 61 152 15 mg n l and the methane yield in the reactor was stable at 478 30 33 35 ml g vs this was within the methane yield range of stable fw ad reactors reported previously 400 500 ml g vs zhang et al 2022 2020 and no acid accumulation was observed only a very low acetate concentration 16 12 4 64 mg l was detected at the end of this phase thus phase i was referred to as the stable phase in phase ii 41 80 d tan gradually increased to 2942 33 137 97 mg n l during this period the vfas concentrations in the system increased especially the acetate concentration which increased from 16 15 1 93 mg l phase i to 4897 91 1558 96 mg l at the end of phase ii the propionate butyrate and valerate concentrations were 684 57 161 65 mg l 473 85 91 06 mg l and 632 56 114 34 mg l respectively at the end of phase ii the accumulation of vfas resulted in a significant decrease in methane yield p 0 05 these results indicated that the reactor was severely inhibited by ammonia in phase ii zhang et al 2020 conducted three sequential batch experiments and found that similar level of ammonia nitrogen could significantly decrease the methane production performance of the reactor p 0 05 and caused a significant acetate accumulation as well peng et al 2018 also observed a similar phenomenon in a dry ad reactor for fw operated at a tan level of about 3000 mg n l in phase iii 81 100 d although tan concentration continued to increase to greater than 4000 mg n l exceeding the inhibition threshold reported by many researchers zhang et al 2022 2020 peng et al 2021 the operational state of the reactor began to improve without taking any recovery measures nor stopping the feeding the methane yield increased from 330 44 ml g vs to 466 00 ml g vs in correspond to the fact that the concentrations of acetate propionate butyrate and valerate also decreased by 88 85 82 40 84 41 and 53 67 respectively from phase ii to phase iii the recovery of reactor performance was not fully unexpected and may be related to the domesticated ammonia tolerant microorganisms jo et al 2022 observed that the methane yield recovered and the reactor reached a pseudo steady state under a prolonged ammonia stress due to a shift from ammonia sensitive methanosaeta to ammonia tolerant methanosarcina and methanobacterium park et al 2018 also found that long term exposure of the inoculum to 1 to 2 5 g n l tan domesticated the ammonia tolerant methanosarcinaceae and methanobacteriaceae thereby enhancing the tolerance of the microbial community to ammonia stress in phase iv 101 120 d when tan concentrations gradually increased to 4536 72 248 64 mg n l a significant decrease in methane yield was again observed p 0 05 however the tan in this phase did not continue to accumulate but stabilized at 4181 02 200 07 mg n l by the end on one hand high ammonia nitrogen may affect the mineralization of organic nitrogen such as amino acids by microorganisms reducing production of tan zhang et al 2022 using metaproteomics technology found that amino acid degradation would be inhibited by high ammonia level when studying the response of functional bacteria and their functional protein expression profiles to ammonia stress on the other hand under high stress conditions microorganisms will produce extracellular polymeric substances eps to protect themselves from inhibition and interference protein is one of the important components of eps and its formation requires ammonia nitrogen yang et al 2022 therefore the ammonia nitrogen may be absorbed by microorganisms to produce eps protein components resulting in a decrease in tan in the liquid phase similar phenomena were also observed in the study by peng et al 2018 despite the stabilization of tan levels reactor performance continued to deteriorate and the final methane yield was only 174 07 ml g vs which was 63 61 lower than the average methane yield observed in phase i an increase in the concentration of vfas in the system was again observed however unlike phase ii only propionate showed a significant accumulation in this phase an increase of 584 compared to phase iii while other vfas did not show a significant increase on one hand this may be related to the short operating time 20 days in this phase as described in section 2 2 phase iv was shut down due to laboratory closure as a result of covid 19 pandemic and the reactor could not continue to operate if the operating time was extended the other vfas accumulation would likely be observed later on the other hand the remarkable increase in propionate concentration along with sharply decreased methane yield indicated that irreversible instability had appeared zhang et al 2020 also observed the phenomenon of mainly propionate accumulation in ad system when irreversible instability occurred and inferred that once propionate metabolism was inhibited the methane generation performance of the reactor would irreversibly deteriorate therefore the above results indicate that the process instability in phase ii and phase iv differ in causing mechanisms in summary ammonia nitrogen had exhibited significant effects on metabolic links in the ad process resulting in four phases of reactor operation stability instability recovery and secondary instability and differences in vfa accumulation were observed between phase ii and phase iv to elucidate the causes of these differences integrated genome centric metagenomic and metaproteomic analyses were performed on reactor samples collected at the end of each phase 3 2 microbial metabolic interactions in different phases reads were co assembled obtaining in total 214 975 contigs with a total size of 1431 mbp contigs larger than 10 kbp accounted for approximately 60 91 of the total number which suggested that the assembly was of high quality a total of 31 17 17 and 24 mags were retrieved for phase i ii iii and iv respectively 3 2 1 hydrolytic and acidogenic bacteria given that ad is a multi stage biochemical process mediated by microorganisms mags were broadly classified according to the reported functions of the microorganisms the results are shown in fig 2 and the abundance of each mag is presented in fig 3 fw is mainly composed of carbohydrates proteins and lipids these three types of complex organic matter are first fermented by hydrolyzers into easily degradable small molecules of organic matter subsequently acid producing bacteria ferment these small organic molecules into intermediate metabolic products such as vfas the hydrolysis and acidogenesis processes are often considered the fastest and most stable steps in ad of easily degradable substrates peng et al 2021 a total of 27 mags involved in hydrolysis and acidogenesis were identified in phase i including p verrucomicrobia p bacteroidetes o actinomycetales c clostridia g propioniciclava o aminicenantales o msbl9 o bacteroidales o bacteroidetes vc2 1 bac22 g treponema c gammaproteobacteria s aminobacterium colombiense and s paludibacter propionicigenesand figs 2 and 3a in phase ii the microbial community gradually became specialized to cope with ammonia disturbance as indicated by a decrease in the number of mags involved in hydrolysis and acidogenesis however most of these mags were further enriched fig 3b there was thus no significant difference in the total abundance of hydrolytic and acidogenic bacteria between phase ii and phase i p 0 05 indicating that ammonia stress did not have a significant effect on hydrolytic and acidogenic bacteria in phase iii the total relative abundance of hydrolytic and acidogenic bacteria decreased by 39 59 fig 3c however as stated in section 3 1 the reactor performance was improved during this phase indicating that the decrease in hydrolytic and acidogenic bacteria abundance did not have a negative impact on system performance in phase iv a few mags such as f ruminococcaceae were not detected however some new mags such as o bacteroidales g sphaerochaeta and p proteobacteria were observed resulting in an increase of 98 49 in the total abundance of hydrolytic and acidogenic bacteria in phase iv compared with phase iii and this was even higher than the total abundance of hydrolytic and acidogenic bacteria in phase i fig 3d thus the functional resistance and redundancy maintained a high abundance of hydrolytic and acidogenic bacteria indicating that the hydrolysis and acidogenesis process may not be influenced by the ammonia inhibition 3 2 2 acetogenic bacteria the products of hydrolytic and acidogenic bacteria are further converted into acetate h2 and co2 which can be directly used by methanogens in this study four mags involved in acetogenesis were detected in phase i with a total relative abundance of 6 00 including g treponema p atribacteria g smithella and s syntrophus aciditrophicus fig 3a the g treponema was determined to be a homoacetogen and this taxon has also been reported as the dominant microorganism in high efficiency reactors li et al 2019 the p atribacteria are newly discovered syntrophic acetate oxidation sao bacteria aoyagi et al 2020 both g smithella and s syntrophus aciditrophicus belong to the phylum proteobacteria the former are typical syntrophic propionate oxidizing bacteria zhang et al 2018 and the latter can degrade four to eight saturated fatty acids into formate acetate co2 and h2 chen et al 2016 in phase ii g treponema remained the most dominant microorganism indicating that it exhibited some degree of ammonia tolerance both functional bacteria in the phyla proteobacteria and the phyla atribacteria involved in the degradation of longer chain vfas lcvfas namely propionate butyrate and valerate were severely inhibited by ammonia and were undetectable in this phase a new mag in the order clostridiales belonging to the phylum firmicutes was observed in phase ii and this order contains many genera that can metabolize vfas however this mag was not dominant its abundance was extremely low only 0 51 fig 3b which may be the main reason for the accumulation of vfas at this phase as the tan concentration increased the p firmicutes gradually adapted to the high ammonia conditions in phase iii as evidenced by the presence of more mags in the phylum firmicutes with higher abundance in the reactor in addition new mags in the phylum proteobacteria were also detected fig 3c the p firmicutes contains strains with diverse functions including hydrolyzers acid producing bacteria and vfa degrading bacteria the p firmicutes have thick cell walls and can produce endospores to survive under extreme conditions zhou et al 2020 it is thus often observed in high ammonia systems most members of the phylum proteobacteria are known to produce h2 by decomposing acetate propionate and butyrate xing et al 2020 the presence of the aforementioned ammonia resistant vfa degrading bacteria restored the acid degrading function of the microbial community confirming the hypothesis derived from the physicochemical analysis in section 3 1 in phase iv ammonia stress was further increased the vfa degrading function of the microbial community was still mediated by p firmicutes and p proteobacteria however the response patterns of mags in both p firmicutes and p proteobacteria differed for example the abundance of p proteobacteria 1 was 19 11 higher in phase iv than in phase iii whereas the abundance of p proteobacteria 2 was 36 47 lower in phase iv than in phase iii fig 3d as mentioned above both p firmicutes and p proteobacteria can utilize various intermediate metabolites thus it is highly likely that mags in these two phyla mediated the oxidation of different vfas the accumulation of propionate in the reactor was most likely caused by the mags with decreased abundance in p firmicutes and p proteobacteria zhang et al 2020 reported that s pelotomaculum and s syntrophomonas were key microorganisms responsible for instability induced by ammonia inhibition and both of them belong to the phylum firmicutes the phylum proteobacteria has also been reported to be the main cause of impaired propionate and butyrate metabolism under ammonia stress liu et al 2021 these results suggest that the low or reduced abundance of taxa in the phyla firmicutes and proteobacteria were the main causes of the poor performance 3 2 3 methanogens finally small molecules of organic matter produced in the acetogenesis step are converted to methane by methanogens through different metabolic pathways usually the methane produced by the acetoclastic methanogenesis pathway and hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis pathway hm pathway account for more than 60 and 30 of the total methane production respectively and these two methanogenesis pathways are the focus of the following discussion in the steady phase phase i only two hydrogenotrophic methanogenic mags g methanospirillum and g methanobacterium were retrieved fig 2 because acetoclastic methanogens are highly sensitive to ammonia exposure even at low tan levels 1000 mg n l wang et al 2022 the number and abundance of methanogens decreased after ammonia disturbance fig 3b suggesting that the inhibition on methanogenesis may also have key effects on reactor performance however in phase iii the abundance of hydrogenotrophic methanogens g candidatus methanoplasma continued to decrease fig 3c yet a gradual recovery in reactor performance was observed in phase iv the abundance of s methanoculleus bourgensis ms2 increased by 72 51 fig 3d which probably stems from the fact that the activity of hydrogenotrophic methanogens could recover at this tan level wang et al 2022 the s methanoculleus bourgensis ms2 was reported to grow fast with a maximum specific growth rate of 0 039 h fotidis et al 2013 and the presence of a large number of redundant methanogenic related genes in s methanoculleus bourgensis ms2 contributed to its high functional plasticity kougias et al 2017 therefore methanoculleus bourgensis ms2 is often used for bioaugmentation to alleviate ammonia inhibition for example yan et al 2020c reported that bioaugmentation with methanoculleus bourgensis ms2 culture markedly enhanced the methane yield by 21 however the increase in the abundance of s methanoculleus bourgensis ms2 and the decrease in methane yield occurred simultaneously in this study suggesting that methanogens may not be responsible for the changes in reactor performance zhang et al 2020 conducted batch experiments with various ammonia concentrations and also observed that the methanogenesis step was not the key metabolic link mediating process instability under ammonia stress 3 2 4 interaction mechanisms considering that the ad process is a cascade of organic matter metabolism redundancy analysis was used to explore the interactive relationship between key physicochemical parameters and ad four stage involving microorganisms so as to decipher the potential interaction mechanism among microorganisms and to provide further evidence for the determination of key microorganisms fig s5 in terms of physicochemical parameters methane yield was negatively correlated with tan and propionate but not significantly correlated with acetate butyrate and valerate confirming that tan lead to reduced methane yield by inhibiting propionate degradation rather than inhibiting the degradation of acetate butyrate and valerate hydrolytic and acidogenic bacteria such as c gammaproteobacteria o msbl9 s paludibacter propionicigenes and s syntrophus aciditrophicus were negatively correlated with tan while hydrolytic and acidogenic bacteria c clostridia and g sphaerochaeta were positively correlated with tan suggesting that hydrolytic and acidogenic bacteria can maintain hydrolysis and acidogenesis functions through functional redundancy similarly g methanospirillum and g methanobacterium were negatively correlated with tan but g candidatus methanoplasma and s methanoculleus bourgensis ms2 were positively correlated with tan indicating the evolution of methanogens under ammonia stress which allowed the stable methane metabolism in comparison the acetogens g smithella and s syntrophus aciditrophicus belonging to proteobacteria were negatively correlated with tan indicating that they were indeed inhibited by ammonia these microorganisms were also negatively correlated with propionate and positively correlated with methane yield suggesting that the decrease in their abundance lead to the accumulation of propionate which in turn caused a decrease in methane yield in addition it was observed that g smithella s syntrophus aciditrophicus g methanospirillum and g methanobacterium were positively correlated but they were negatively correlated with tan reflecting that in a low ammonia nitrogen environment g methanospirillum and g methanobacterium may act as hydrogen consuming microorganisms and engage in symbiosis with g smithella and s syntrophus aciditrophicus for the firmicutes phylum acetogens such as p firmicutes and s syntrophomonas wolfei were positively correlated with tan and ammonia tolerant g candidatus methanoplasma and s methanoculleus bourgensis ms2 implying that under high ammonia stress these microorganisms could engage in cooperative symbiosis however as shown in fig s5 p firmicutes and s syntrophomonas wolfei were positively correlated with propionate indicating that they may have propionate tolerance but were unable to effectively degrade propionate overall it can be inferred that functional microorganisms belonging to proteobacteria phylum were directly inhibited by ammonia while functional microorganisms belonging to firmicutes phylum were unable to effectively degrade vfa especially propionate suggesting that they were the potential key microorganisms that caused a deterioration of reactor performance therefore it is necessary to conduct in depth metabolic activity analysis on them 3 3 genome reconstruction of potential key microorganisms and their metaproteomic responses to ammonia stress to further reveal the metabolic activity response patterns of key microorganisms manual genome annotation and metabolic pathway reconstruction were performed and the expression of active proteins was determined a detailed information regarding the quality control of the metaproteomic data is provided in fig s6 in light of the high vfa accumulation observed in section 3 1 the following discussion will be focused on vfa metabolism primarily achieved by p firmicutes and p proteobacteria 3 3 1 acetate metabolism as shown in fig 4 the sao of microbial communities mainly proceeded through the wood ljungdahl pathway or the glycine cleavage system pathway the identified proteins were mapped to the pathways of kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes figs 4 and 5 shows the numbers of significant deps in phase ii the acetate metabolic activity of p firmicutes was strongly inhibited there was a significant decrease in the expression of acetate kinase ec 2 7 2 1 acka pyruvate ferredoxin oxidoreductase ec 1 2 7 1 pora and glycine hydroxymethyltransferase ec 2 1 2 1 glya in phase ii compared with phase i fig 5a this was consistent with the extremely low abundance of p firmicutes in phase ii in section 3 2 which was accompanied by high acetate accumulation implying that the acetate degradation function of the community was mainly mediated by p firmicutes in phase iii the activities of the above functional enzymes of the p firmicutes recovered and many significantly up regulated deps were newly observed resulting a high percentage 86 96 of significantly up regulated deps phase iii vs phase ii fig 5a this was consistent with the appearance of a large number of mags in the phylum firmicutes at phase iii in section 3 2 thus the presence of functionally redundant microorganisms mitigated the accumulation of acetate in the reactor in this phase the acetate metabolic activity of p proteobacteria was enhanced along with the percentage 75 of significantly up regulated deps phase iii vs phase ii fig 5b this was consistent with the observation of mags belonging to p proteobacteria at phase iii in section 3 2 and contributed to the further enhancement of the sao of microbial communities at higher tan concentrations phase iv no significantly up regulated proteins in the proteobacteria populations were detected and the expression of acetyl coa synthetase ec 6 2 1 1 acss1 2 of this phylum remained significantly inhibited phase iv vs phase iii which resulted in a decrease in the acetate metabolic activity of p proteobacteria fig 5b by contrast the high acetate metabolic activity of p firmicutes was maintained as indicated by the similar number of significantly up regulated proteins 11 and down regulated proteins 12 phase iv vs phase iii fig 5a as discussed above hydrogenotrophic methanogens were also enriched in phase iv given that saohm is an efficient metabolic pathway capable of mediating resistance to extreme ammonia concentrations wang et al 2022 the synergistic effects of the firmicutes populations and hydrogenotrophic methanogens were sufficient for mediating the acetate degradation which may account for the maintenance of the low acetate concentrations in the reactor 3 3 2 propionate metabolism propionate was first activated and then degraded via the methylmalonyl coa pathway mmc pathway and a total of 17 mmc related proteins were expressed fig 4 the impaired propionate metabolic activity of p proteobacteria was observed in phase ii as evidenced by the fact that 80 of the significant deps were down regulated proteins phase ii vs phase i fig 5b this was consistent with the absence of g smithella in phase ii in section 3 2 the propionate metabolic activity of p firmicutes was not affected by ammonia nitrogen as indicated by the similar number of significantly up regulated proteins 10 and down regulated proteins 9 phase ii vs phase i fig 5a however the extremely low abundance of this bacterium did not appear to compensate for the negative effect of the absence of the aforementioned dominant bacteria on the propionate degradation function of the community therefore propionate still accumulated in the reactor in phase iii the propionate metabolic activity of p proteobacteria remained severely inhibited and 92 31 of its significant deps were down regulated phase iii vs phase ii fig 5b however the number of significantly up regulated proteins derived from p firmicutes was 150 higher compared with the number of significantly up regulated proteins for the comparisons of samples collected in phases ii and i this coupled with the lack of a change in the number of significantly down regulated proteins fig 5a indicates that propionate metabolic activity in this taxon was enhanced this was consistent with the observation of many new mags in p firmicutes in phase iii in section 3 2 which also alleviated propionate accumulation in the reactor implying that the propionate degradation function of the community in this phase was mainly mediated by p firmicutes as the tan concentration further increased the propionate metabolic activity of both key taxa was inhibited for p firmicutes the number of significantly down regulated proteins was 133 33 higher in the phase iv vs phase iii comparison than in the phase iii vs phase ii comparison for example all deps were significantly down regulated in both succinyl coa synthetase ec 6 2 1 5 sucd and fumarate hydratase ec 4 2 1 2 fuma fig 5a zhang et al 2022 showed that high ammonia stress inhibited the expression of succinyl coa synthetase which in turn affected the syntrophic propionate oxidation process zhang et al 2020 also observed that propionate degrading bacteria g pelotomaculum belonging to the phylum firmicutes were resistant to ammonia stress at 3000 mg n l however these bacteria were inhibited at tan 6000 mg n l and this inhibition was irreversible for p proteobacteria the propionate metabolic activity was still inhibited the expression of acetyl coa synthetase methylmalonyl coa mutase ec 5 4 99 2 mut fumarate hydratase malate dehydrogenase ec 1 1 1 37 mdh1 and pyruvate carboxylase ec 6 4 1 1 pc was severely inhibited and the proportion of significantly down regulated proteins was 85 71 phase iv vs phase iii fig 5b liu et al 2021 also found that ammonia stress inhibited the expression of acetyl coa synthetase which was one of the reasons for the poor propionate degradation in the reactor therefore the impaired propionate metabolic activity of the key taxa may be the main reason for the high propionate accumulation in the reactor thus the absence of alternative functional proteins or pathways in the reactor made the domestication adaptation of propionate degradation function of the community significantly difficult or even impractical 3 3 3 butyrate and valerate metabolism butyrate was degraded mainly through the β oxidation pathway fig 4 the significant deps in p proteobacteria in the phase ii vs phase i comparison were all down regulated proteins fig 5b indicating that its butyrate metabolic activity was inhibited by ammonia this is consistent with the observation in section 3 2 that butyrate degrading bacteria s syntrophus aciditrophicus belonging to p proteobacteria were absent in phase ii by contrast most of the significant deps in p firmicutes which had a low abundance were up regulated proteins phase ii vs phase i fig 5a indicating that the butyrate metabolic activity of this population was enhanced similar to the propionate metabolism the butyrate metabolic functions of the microbial community mediated by non dominant bacteria p firmicutes were fragile in phase ii which led to the butyrate accumulation in the reactor in phase iii the butyrate metabolic activity of p proteobacteria was still severely inhibited the expression of enoyl coa hydratase ec 4 2 1 17 paaf 3 hydroxybutyryl coa dehydrogenase ec 1 1 1 157 paah and acetyl coa c acetyltransferase ec 2 3 1 9 acat continued to significantly decrease and the ratio of significantly down regulated proteins was 77 78 phase iii vs phase ii fig 5b by contrast the firmicutes population gradually adapted to the high ammonia conditions and the butyrate metabolic activity was further enhanced as evidenced by the fact that all significant deps for the phase iii vs phase ii comparison were up regulated proteins fig 5a this was also consistent with the observation that many new mags in the phylum firmicutes were observed in phase iii in section 3 2 these mags appeared to successfully replace the inhibited p proteobacteria to maintain the butyrate degradation function of the community which efficiently mediated the degradation of the butyrate that had accumulated in phase iii however p firmicutes cannot tolerate extremely high ammonia stress in phase iv the decreased activities of enoyl coa hydratase acetyl coa c acetyltransferase and acetate kinase in p firmicutes were observed thus the percentage of significantly down regulated proteins was 62 96 phase iv vs phase iii fig 5a by contrast the butyrate metabolic activity of p proteobacteria was resistant to ammonia as suggested by the fact that the numbers of significantly down regulated proteins 3 and significantly up regulated proteins 2 were similar for the phase iv vs phase iii comparison fig 5b this maintained the butyrate degradation function of the community and kept the butyrate concentration low similarly for the valerate degradation function of the community most of the significant deps in p firmicutes were up regulated proteins phase ii vs phase i enzymes with significantly enhanced activity included acetyl coa c acetyltransferase and acetate coa transferase ec 2 8 3 18 aarc fig 5a however the valerate metabolic activity of p proteobacteria was strongly inhibited by ammonia as evidenced by a significant decrease in the expression of isovaleryl coa dehydrogenase ec 1 3 8 4 ivo hydroxymethylglutaryl coa lyase ec 4 1 3 4 hmgcl acetyl coa c acetyltransferase and acetyl coa synthetase phase ii vs phase i fig 5b which resulted in the accumulation of valerate in phase iii the valerate degradation function of p proteobacteria showed resistance to ammonia as evidenced by the comparable numbers of significantly down regulated proteins and up regulated proteins phase iii vs phase ii fig 5b the valerate metabolic activity of p firmicutes was further enhanced all significant deps were up regulated proteins phase iii vs phase ii fig 5a the two key taxa together maintained the valerate degradation function of the community and a decrease in the valerate concentration was observed in the reactor in phase iv the valerate metabolic activity of p firmicutes was severely inhibited as evidenced by the fact that the number of significantly down regulated proteins was twice as high as the number of significantly up regulated proteins fig 5a however the valerate metabolic activity of p proteobacteria still showed resistance to ammonia as evidenced by the comparable number of significantly down regulated proteins and significantly up regulated proteins phase iv vs phase iii fig 5b which maintained the valerate degradation function of the community and thus the low valerate concentration in the reactor in sum diverse metabolic functions of the p firmicutes and p proteobacteria including acetate metabolism and lcvfa metabolism were observed in this study which confirmed the observation that firmicutes and proteobacteria members functioned differently as discussed in section 3 2 in phase ii the acetate degradation function of the community was mainly mediated by firmicutes populations their acetate metabolic activity decreased which in turn led to high acetate accumulation in the reactor however in phase iii p firmicutes gradually adapted to the ammonia stress conditions and their acetate metabolic activity recovered in addition the acetate metabolic activity of p proteobacteria was enhanced thus the accumulation of acetate in the reactor was alleviated in phase iv acetate metabolizing bacteria in the phylum proteobacteria were unable to tolerate the high ammonia stress therefore their acetate metabolic activity was decreased however the acetate metabolic activity of p firmicutes was resistant to ammonia this taxon thus maintained the acetate metabolic function of the community through synergistic interactions with hydrogenotrophic methanogens in comparison the lcvfa metabolic activity of p proteobacteria decreased under low ammonia stress phase ii the lcvfa metabolic activity of p firmicutes was not inhibited however because of their extremely low abundance this taxon was unable to fully offset the severely negative effect of the decrease in the lcvfa metabolic activity of the original dominant bacteria which resulted in lcvfa accumulation in the reactor the propionate and butyrate metabolic activity of p proteobacteria remained inhibited as the tan concentration increased phase iii however due to adaptation to high ammonia stress the propionate and butyrate metabolic activity of p firmicutes was further enhanced thus p firmicutes became the main functional bacteria mediating the propionate and butyrate metabolism of the microbial community which mediated the degradation of the propionate and butyrate that had accumulated in the reactor in contrast the valerate metabolic activity of both key taxa was not inhibited therefore a decrease in the valerate concentration was also observed the lcvfa metabolic activity of p firmicutes was strongly inhibited as ammonia stress further increased phase iv the expression of functional proteins related to the propionate metabolism of p proteobacteria was also severely inhibited by ammonia the butyrate and valerate metabolic activity of p proteobacteria showed resistance to ammonia which maintained the butyrate and valerate degradation functions of the microbial community given that the propionate metabolic activity of both key taxa was inhibited by ammonia the propionate metabolism of the community was impaired which might be the underlying cause of the severe propionate accumulation in the reactor under high ammonia stress and the subsequent decrease in methane yield 4 conclusions the key microorganisms responsible for process instability induced by high ammonia stress were p firmicutes and p proteobacteria both of which had exhibited lcvfa and acetate metabolic functions in this study functional redundancy was found as the main mechanism for the maintenance of the acetate butyrate and valerate degradation functions of the microbial community under ammonia stress in contrast the propionate metabolic function of both p firmicutes and p proteobacteria was severely inhibited by high ammonia stress which led to the severe impairment of the propionate metabolic function of the community the accumulation of propionate in the reactor and a decrease in the methane yield therefore the key metabolic link affecting ad performance under ammonia stress was considered as the syntrophic propionate oxidation in engineering applications it is necessary to actively develop alternative pathways for propionate metabolism within the nitrogen rich waste ad reactor such as inducing direct interspecies electron transfer as a substitute for the traditional syntrophic propionate oxidation which will assist in improving ad system performance and stability credit authorship

14659,ammonia is a major inhibitor in anaerobic digestion of nitrogen rich organic wastes in this study integrated genome centric metagenomic and metaproteomic analyses were used to identify the key microorganisms and metabolic links causing instability by characterizing the process performance microbial community and metabolic responses of key microorganisms during endogenous ammonia accumulation the identification of 89 metagenome assembled genomes and analysis of their abundance profile in different operational phases permitted the identification of key taxa firmicutes and proteobacteria causing poor performance metabolic reconstruction indicated that the key taxa had the genetic potential to participate in the metabolism of c2 c5 volatile fatty acids vfas further investigation suggested that during phase i the total ammonia nitrogen tan level was maintained below 2000 mg n l and the reactor showed a high methane yield 478 30 33 35 ml g vs and low vfas concentration when the tan accumulated to 2000 mg n l acid accumulation mainly of acetate began to occur and the methane yield gradually decreased to 330 44 ml g vs phase ii during this phase the vfa degradation functions of the community were mainly mediated by firmicutes approximately 61 54 of significant differentially expressed proteins deps related to acetate metabolism in firmicutes were down regulated which led to an increase in acetate concentration to 4897 91 1558 96 mg l however the reactor performance showed spontaneous recovery without any interference phase iii during which firmicutes gradually adapted to the high ammonia conditions approximately 75 of the significant deps related to acetate metabolism of proteobacteria were also up regulated in phase iii compared with phase ii thus vfa related metabolic functions of the community were enhanced which resulted in a decrease in the total vfa concentration to 195 39 mg l when the tan increased above 4000 mg n l the system gradually showed acid accumulation dominated by propionate accompanied by a second decrease in methane yield phase iv during this phase the number of up regulated and down regulated proteins related to acetate metabolism of firmicutes and butyrate valerate metabolism of proteobacteria was comparable with that of phase iii indicating that the metabolic functions related to acetate butyrate and valerate of the microbial community were not significantly affected however for propionate metabolism the expression activity of fumarate hydratase from firmicutes and proteobacteria was severely inhibited by ammonia as shown by down regulation ratios of 63 64 and 85 71 respectively no protein with the same function that was not inhibited by ammonia could be detected and the fumarate degradation function of the microbial community was severely damaged leading to blocked propionate metabolism and irreversible deterioration of reactor performance this study has provided a new perspective on the microecological mechanisms of ammonia inhibition graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords anaerobic digestion ammonia inhibition metagenome assembled genomes metaproteomics data availability the authors are unable or have chosen not to specify which data has been used 1 introduction food waste fw is one of the world s largest waste streams in 2020 125 million tons of fw were generated in china zhu et al 2022a because fw is rich in organic matter anaerobic digestion ad is considered the most suitable technology for treating fw cheng et al 2020 however fw has a high protein content and approximately 33 80 of the proteins and amino acids in fw are degraded to ammonia nitrogen thus ammonia can easily accumulate during the ad process palakodeti et al 2021 ammonia nitrogen mainly exists as free ammonia and ammonium ions free ammonia can penetrate the cell membrane of microorganisms and result in proton imbalances alterations in intracellular ph decreases in the efficiency of enzymatic reactions and increases in the energy required for cell maintenance palakodeti et al 2021 ammonium ions have direct negative effects on the activity of enzymes in anaerobes e g acetyl coa decarbonylase and methyl coenzyme m reductase zhu et al 2022b therefore high concentrations of ammonia nitrogen can negatively influence the performance of ad systems resulting in decreased methane production foaming and even process failure in commercial biogas plants yang et al 2022 various approaches have been used to alleviate ammonia inhibition such as reducing the ammonia concentration e g co digestion zhang et al 2019 and ammonia stripping palakodeti et al 2021 and improving ammonia tolerance e g use of additives yan et al 2020a bioaugmentation li et al 2022 and innovative light assisted bioreactors zhu et al 2022b however the issue of ammonia inhibition has never been fundamentally solved some reactors still showed signs of ammonia inhibition at low concentrations 3000 mg n l even after bioaugmentation of syntrophic acetate oxidizing co cultures fotidis et al 2013 in contrast there are also some reactors with satisfactory methane yield with ammonia concentrations as high as 7250 mg n l yan et al 2020b therefore the mechanism of ammonia inhibition requires further investigation considering that microorganisms are the main functional body in the ad system the fundamental reason for the aforementioned contrasting phenomena primarily lies in differences in microorganisms among systems ad reactors have long been considered as black boxes in recent years omics technologies have gained rapid development for example 16s rrna gene sequencing has permitted high resolution taxonomic analyses of microbial communities zhang et al 2020 gene centric metagenomic sequencing can be used to comprehensively analyze the functions and metabolic pathways of microbial communities li et al 2020 metaproteomic sequencing can be used to characterize protein expression profiles of microbial communities and provide direct evidence of microbial metabolic functions heyer et al 2019 a small number of studies have recently used integrated gene centric metagenomic and metaproteomic sequencing to investigate differences in active microorganisms and the expression of functional proteins between the steady state phase and ammonia induced instability phase in ad reactors zhang et al 2022 liu et al 2021 by contrast genome centric metagenomic approaches can be used to identify metagenome assembled genomes mags through the binning of assembled contigs which can permit the functional traits of individual species to be extracted from complex communities without relying on extant databases and pure culture techniques zhu et al 2019 this approach combined with metaproteomic analysis of the mag activity response can clarify the underlying causes of changes in key mags however few studies have used integrated genome centric metagenomic and metaproteomic analyses to elucidate the responses of the microbial community to ammonia stress in ad system here the responses of the microbial community to ammonia stress during the stability instability recovery secondary instability process during endogenous ammonia accumulation in the fw ad system were explored specifically metagenomic binning was used to recover near complete mags from complex microbial communities the resulting mags were used to manually reconstruct the metabolic pathways of the genomes and then used as a reference platform to analyze the protein expression profiles of the genomes the objectives of this study were to clarify ammonia shaped interspecies interactions and niche differentiation identify the key metabolic links and microorganisms affecting ad performance under ammonia stress and elucidate the metabolic activity response patterns of key microorganisms this study provides new insights that will help optimize the ad process of nitrogen rich wastes 2 material and methods 2 1 substrate and inoculum synthetic high protein fw was made in one batch which contains vegetable meat rice and vegetable oil and the wet based mass ratio of these components was 39 16 44 1 the purpose of using synthetic high protein fw was to avoid excessive fat content of the substrate ensure that ammonia was the only disturbance factor and ensure the uniformity of the substrate and reproducibility of the experimental results zhang et al 2022 before use the substrate was kept in a freezer at 20 c the inoculum was taken from a biogas digester in chongqing and the retrieved sludge was first filtered to remove coarse impurities the filtered sludge was then pre incubated to consume the residual organic matter until the biogas production stopped completely finally the sludge was domesticated to facilitate adaptation to the fw the physicochemical properties of the substrate and inoculum are shown in table s1 2 2 experimental setup and operation the anaerobic digester was operated in a semi continuous mode at 37 1 c the top of the reactor was equipped with a stirring motor at a speed of 100 r min and with a 2 h interval for every 4 h of stirring the organic loading rate and hydraulic retention time were set at 2 5 g vs l d and 40 d respectively during the experiment with daily feeding endogenous ammonia accumulation was induced with synthetic high protein fw and the reactor experienced a process of stability instability phase i and ii natural recovery phase iii of system performance was observed after continuous operation at 106 d of operation a second decrease in methane yield was observed thus the reactor experienced a process of secondary instability phase iv by 120 d operation of the reactor ceased due to a laboratory

and discussion 3 1 effects of ammonia on ad performance fig 1 shows the response of the reactor performance parameters to ammonia stress the whole experimental period was divided into four phases based on the methane yield in phase i 0 40 d synthetic high protein fw was degraded tan in the reactor increased from 816 34 119 mg n l to 1912 61 152 15 mg n l and the methane yield in the reactor was stable at 478 30 33 35 ml g vs this was within the methane yield range of stable fw ad reactors reported previously 400 500 ml g vs zhang et al 2022 2020 and no acid accumulation was observed only a very low acetate concentration 16 12 4 64 mg l was detected at the end of this phase thus phase i was referred to as the stable phase in phase ii 41 80 d tan gradually increased to 2942 33 137 97 mg n l during this period the vfas concentrations in the system increased especially the acetate concentration which increased from 16 15 1 93 mg l phase i to 4897 91 1558 96 mg l at the end of phase ii the propionate butyrate and valerate concentrations were 684 57 161 65 mg l 473 85 91 06 mg l and 632 56 114 34 mg l respectively at the end of phase ii the accumulation of vfas resulted in a significant decrease in methane yield p 0 05 these results indicated that the reactor was severely inhibited by ammonia in phase ii zhang et al 2020 conducted three sequential batch experiments and found that similar level of ammonia nitrogen could significantly decrease the methane production performance of the reactor p 0 05 and caused a significant acetate accumulation as well peng et al 2018 also observed a similar phenomenon in a dry ad reactor for fw operated at a tan level of about 3000 mg n l in phase iii 81 100 d although tan concentration continued to increase to greater than 4000 mg n l exceeding the inhibition threshold reported by many researchers zhang et al 2022 2020 peng et al 2021 the operational state of the reactor began to improve without taking any recovery measures nor stopping the feeding the methane yield increased from 330 44 ml g vs to 466 00 ml g vs in correspond to the fact that the concentrations of acetate propionate butyrate and valerate also decreased by 88 85 82 40 84 41 and 53 67 respectively from phase ii to phase iii the recovery of reactor performance was not fully unexpected and may be related to the domesticated ammonia tolerant microorganisms jo et al 2022 observed that the methane yield recovered and the reactor reached a pseudo steady state under a prolonged ammonia stress due to a shift from ammonia sensitive methanosaeta to ammonia tolerant methanosarcina and methanobacterium park et al 2018 also found that long term exposure of the inoculum to 1 to 2 5 g n l tan domesticated the ammonia tolerant methanosarcinaceae and methanobacteriaceae thereby enhancing the tolerance of the microbial community to ammonia stress in phase iv 101 120 d when tan concentrations gradually increased to 4536 72 248 64 mg n l a significant decrease in methane yield was again observed p 0 05 however the tan in this phase did not continue to accumulate but stabilized at 4181 02 200 07 mg n l by the end on one hand high ammonia nitrogen may affect the mineralization of organic nitrogen such as amino acids by microorganisms reducing production of tan zhang et al 2022 using metaproteomics technology found that amino acid degradation would be inhibited by high ammonia level when studying the response of functional bacteria and their functional protein expression profiles to ammonia stress on the other hand under high stress conditions microorganisms will produce extracellular polymeric substances eps to protect themselves from inhibition and interference protein is one of the important components of eps and its formation requires ammonia nitrogen yang et al 2022 therefore the ammonia nitrogen may be absorbed by microorganisms to produce eps protein components resulting in a decrease in tan in the liquid phase similar phenomena were also observed in the study by peng et al 2018 despite the stabilization of tan levels reactor performance continued to deteriorate and the final methane yield was only 174 07 ml g vs which was 63 61 lower than the average methane yield observed in phase i an increase in the concentration of vfas in the system was again observed however unlike phase ii only propionate showed a significant accumulation in this phase an increase of 584 compared to phase iii while other vfas did not show a significant increase on one hand this may be related to the short operating time 20 days in this phase as described in section 2 2 phase iv was shut down due to laboratory closure as a result of covid 19 pandemic and the reactor could not continue to operate if the operating time was extended the other vfas accumulation would likely be observed later on the other hand the remarkable increase in propionate concentration along with sharply decreased methane yield indicated that irreversible instability had appeared zhang et al 2020 also observed the phenomenon of mainly propionate accumulation in ad system when irreversible instability occurred and inferred that once propionate metabolism was inhibited the methane generation performance of the reactor would irreversibly deteriorate therefore the above results indicate that the process instability in phase ii and phase iv differ in causing mechanisms in summary ammonia nitrogen had exhibited significant effects on metabolic links in the ad process resulting in four phases of reactor operation stability instability recovery and secondary instability and differences in vfa accumulation were observed between phase ii and phase iv to elucidate the causes of these differences integrated genome centric metagenomic and metaproteomic analyses were performed on reactor samples collected at the end of each phase 3 2 microbial metabolic interactions in different phases reads were co assembled obtaining in total 214 975 contigs with a total size of 1431 mbp contigs larger than 10 kbp accounted for approximately 60 91 of the total number which suggested that the assembly was of high quality a total of 31 17 17 and 24 mags were retrieved for phase i ii iii and iv respectively 3 2 1 hydrolytic and acidogenic bacteria given that ad is a multi stage biochemical process mediated by microorganisms mags were broadly classified according to the reported functions of the microorganisms the results are shown in fig 2 and the abundance of each mag is presented in fig 3 fw is mainly composed of carbohydrates proteins and lipids these three types of complex organic matter are first fermented by hydrolyzers into easily degradable small molecules of organic matter subsequently acid producing bacteria ferment these small organic molecules into intermediate metabolic products such as vfas the hydrolysis and acidogenesis processes are often considered the fastest and most stable steps in ad of easily degradable substrates peng et al 2021 a total of 27 mags involved in hydrolysis and acidogenesis were identified in phase i including p verrucomicrobia p bacteroidetes o actinomycetales c clostridia g propioniciclava o aminicenantales o msbl9 o bacteroidales o bacteroidetes vc2 1 bac22 g treponema c gammaproteobacteria s aminobacterium colombiense and s paludibacter propionicigenesand figs 2 and 3a in phase ii the microbial community gradually became specialized to cope with ammonia disturbance as indicated by a decrease in the number of mags involved in hydrolysis and acidogenesis however most of these mags were further enriched fig 3b there was thus no significant difference in the total abundance of hydrolytic and acidogenic bacteria between phase ii and phase i p 0 05 indicating that ammonia stress did not have a significant effect on hydrolytic and acidogenic bacteria in phase iii the total relative abundance of hydrolytic and acidogenic bacteria decreased by 39 59 fig 3c however as stated in section 3 1 the reactor performance was improved during this phase indicating that the decrease in hydrolytic and acidogenic bacteria abundance did not have a negative impact on system performance in phase iv a few mags such as f ruminococcaceae were not detected however some new mags such as o bacteroidales g sphaerochaeta and p proteobacteria were observed resulting in an increase of 98 49 in the total abundance of hydrolytic and acidogenic bacteria in phase iv compared with phase iii and this was even higher than the total abundance of hydrolytic and acidogenic bacteria in phase i fig 3d thus the functional resistance and redundancy maintained a high abundance of hydrolytic and acidogenic bacteria indicating that the hydrolysis and acidogenesis process may not be influenced by the ammonia inhibition 3 2 2 acetogenic bacteria the products of hydrolytic and acidogenic bacteria are further converted into acetate h2 and co2 which can be directly used by methanogens in this study four mags involved in acetogenesis were detected in phase i with a total relative abundance of 6 00 including g treponema p atribacteria g smithella and s syntrophus aciditrophicus fig 3a the g treponema was determined to be a homoacetogen and this taxon has also been reported as the dominant microorganism in high efficiency reactors li et al 2019 the p atribacteria are newly discovered syntrophic acetate oxidation sao bacteria aoyagi et al 2020 both g smithella and s syntrophus aciditrophicus belong to the phylum proteobacteria the former are typical syntrophic propionate oxidizing bacteria zhang et al 2018 and the latter can degrade four to eight saturated fatty acids into formate acetate co2 and h2 chen et al 2016 in phase ii g treponema remained the most dominant microorganism indicating that it exhibited some degree of ammonia tolerance both functional bacteria in the phyla proteobacteria and the phyla atribacteria involved in the degradation of longer chain vfas lcvfas namely propionate butyrate and valerate were severely inhibited by ammonia and were undetectable in this phase a new mag in the order clostridiales belonging to the phylum firmicutes was observed in phase ii and this order contains many genera that can metabolize vfas however this mag was not dominant its abundance was extremely low only 0 51 fig 3b which may be the main reason for the accumulation of vfas at this phase as the tan concentration increased the p firmicutes gradually adapted to the high ammonia conditions in phase iii as evidenced by the presence of more mags in the phylum firmicutes with higher abundance in the reactor in addition new mags in the phylum proteobacteria were also detected fig 3c the p firmicutes contains strains with diverse functions including hydrolyzers acid producing bacteria and vfa degrading bacteria the p firmicutes have thick cell walls and can produce endospores to survive under extreme conditions zhou et al 2020 it is thus often observed in high ammonia systems most members of the phylum proteobacteria are known to produce h2 by decomposing acetate propionate and butyrate xing et al 2020 the presence of the aforementioned ammonia resistant vfa degrading bacteria restored the acid degrading function of the microbial community confirming the hypothesis derived from the physicochemical analysis in section 3 1 in phase iv ammonia stress was further increased the vfa degrading function of the microbial community was still mediated by p firmicutes and p proteobacteria however the response patterns of mags in both p firmicutes and p proteobacteria differed for example the abundance of p proteobacteria 1 was 19 11 higher in phase iv than in phase iii whereas the abundance of p proteobacteria 2 was 36 47 lower in phase iv than in phase iii fig 3d as mentioned above both p firmicutes and p proteobacteria can utilize various intermediate metabolites thus it is highly likely that mags in these two phyla mediated the oxidation of different vfas the accumulation of propionate in the reactor was most likely caused by the mags with decreased abundance in p firmicutes and p proteobacteria zhang et al 2020 reported that s pelotomaculum and s syntrophomonas were key microorganisms responsible for instability induced by ammonia inhibition and both of them belong to the phylum firmicutes the phylum proteobacteria has also been reported to be the main cause of impaired propionate and butyrate metabolism under ammonia stress liu et al 2021 these results suggest that the low or reduced abundance of taxa in the phyla firmicutes and proteobacteria were the main causes of the poor performance 3 2 3 methanogens finally small molecules of organic matter produced in the acetogenesis step are converted to methane by methanogens through different metabolic pathways usually the methane produced by the acetoclastic methanogenesis pathway and hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis pathway hm pathway account for more than 60 and 30 of the total methane production respectively and these two methanogenesis pathways are the focus of the following discussion in the steady phase phase i only two hydrogenotrophic methanogenic mags g methanospirillum and g methanobacterium were retrieved fig 2 because acetoclastic methanogens are highly sensitive to ammonia exposure even at low tan levels 1000 mg n l wang et al 2022 the number and abundance of methanogens decreased after ammonia disturbance fig 3b suggesting that the inhibition on methanogenesis may also have key effects on reactor performance however in phase iii the abundance of hydrogenotrophic methanogens g candidatus methanoplasma continued to decrease fig 3c yet a gradual recovery in reactor performance was observed in phase iv the abundance of s methanoculleus bourgensis ms2 increased by 72 51 fig 3d which probably stems from the fact that the activity of hydrogenotrophic methanogens could recover at this tan level wang et al 2022 the s methanoculleus bourgensis ms2 was reported to grow fast with a maximum specific growth rate of 0 039 h fotidis et al 2013 and the presence of a large number of redundant methanogenic related genes in s methanoculleus bourgensis ms2 contributed to its high functional plasticity kougias et al 2017 therefore methanoculleus bourgensis ms2 is often used for bioaugmentation to alleviate ammonia inhibition for example yan et al 2020c reported that bioaugmentation with methanoculleus bourgensis ms2 culture markedly enhanced the methane yield by 21 however the increase in the abundance of s methanoculleus bourgensis ms2 and the decrease in methane yield occurred simultaneously in this study suggesting that methanogens may not be responsible for the changes in reactor performance zhang et al 2020 conducted batch experiments with various ammonia concentrations and also observed that the methanogenesis step was not the key metabolic link mediating process instability under ammonia stress 3 2 4 interaction mechanisms considering that the ad process is a cascade of organic matter metabolism redundancy analysis was used to explore the interactive relationship between key physicochemical parameters and ad four stage involving microorganisms so as to decipher the potential interaction mechanism among microorganisms and to provide further evidence for the determination of key microorganisms fig s5 in terms of physicochemical parameters methane yield was negatively correlated with tan and propionate but not significantly correlated with acetate butyrate and valerate confirming that tan lead to reduced methane yield by inhibiting propionate degradation rather than inhibiting the degradation of acetate butyrate and valerate hydrolytic and acidogenic bacteria such as c gammaproteobacteria o msbl9 s paludibacter propionicigenes and s syntrophus aciditrophicus were negatively correlated with tan while hydrolytic and acidogenic bacteria c clostridia and g sphaerochaeta were positively correlated with tan suggesting that hydrolytic and acidogenic bacteria can maintain hydrolysis and acidogenesis functions through functional redundancy similarly g methanospirillum and g methanobacterium were negatively correlated with tan but g candidatus methanoplasma and s methanoculleus bourgensis ms2 were positively correlated with tan indicating the evolution of methanogens under ammonia stress which allowed the stable methane metabolism in comparison the acetogens g smithella and s syntrophus aciditrophicus belonging to proteobacteria were negatively correlated with tan indicating that they were indeed inhibited by ammonia these microorganisms were also negatively correlated with propionate and positively correlated with methane yield suggesting that the decrease in their abundance lead to the accumulation of propionate which in turn caused a decrease in methane yield in addition it was observed that g smithella s syntrophus aciditrophicus g methanospirillum and g methanobacterium were positively correlated but they were negatively correlated with tan reflecting that in a low ammonia nitrogen environment g methanospirillum and g methanobacterium may act as hydrogen consuming microorganisms and engage in symbiosis with g smithella and s syntrophus aciditrophicus for the firmicutes phylum acetogens such as p firmicutes and s syntrophomonas wolfei were positively correlated with tan and ammonia tolerant g candidatus methanoplasma and s methanoculleus bourgensis ms2 implying that under high ammonia stress these microorganisms could engage in cooperative symbiosis however as shown in fig s5 p firmicutes and s syntrophomonas wolfei were positively correlated with propionate indicating that they may have propionate tolerance but were unable to effectively degrade propionate overall it can be inferred that functional microorganisms belonging to proteobacteria phylum were directly inhibited by ammonia while functional microorganisms belonging to firmicutes phylum were unable to effectively degrade vfa especially propionate suggesting that they were the potential key microorganisms that caused a deterioration of reactor performance therefore it is necessary to conduct in depth metabolic activity analysis on them 3 3 genome reconstruction of potential key microorganisms and their metaproteomic responses to ammonia stress to further reveal the metabolic activity response patterns of key microorganisms manual genome annotation and metabolic pathway reconstruction were performed and the expression of active proteins was determined a detailed information regarding the quality control of the metaproteomic data is provided in fig s6 in light of the high vfa accumulation observed in section 3 1 the following discussion will be focused on vfa metabolism primarily achieved by p firmicutes and p proteobacteria 3 3 1 acetate metabolism as shown in fig 4 the sao of microbial communities mainly proceeded through the wood ljungdahl pathway or the glycine cleavage system pathway the identified proteins were mapped to the pathways of kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes figs 4 and 5 shows the numbers of significant deps in phase ii the acetate metabolic activity of p firmicutes was strongly inhibited there was a significant decrease in the expression of acetate kinase ec 2 7 2 1 acka pyruvate ferredoxin oxidoreductase ec 1 2 7 1 pora and glycine hydroxymethyltransferase ec 2 1 2 1 glya in phase ii compared with phase i fig 5a this was consistent with the extremely low abundance of p firmicutes in phase ii in section 3 2 which was accompanied by high acetate accumulation implying that the acetate degradation function of the community was mainly mediated by p firmicutes in phase iii the activities of the above functional enzymes of the p firmicutes recovered and many significantly up regulated deps were newly observed resulting a high percentage 86 96 of significantly up regulated deps phase iii vs phase ii fig 5a this was consistent with the appearance of a large number of mags in the phylum firmicutes at phase iii in section 3 2 thus the presence of functionally redundant microorganisms mitigated the accumulation of acetate in the reactor in this phase the acetate metabolic activity of p proteobacteria was enhanced along with the percentage 75 of significantly up regulated deps phase iii vs phase ii fig 5b this was consistent with the observation of mags belonging to p proteobacteria at phase iii in section 3 2 and contributed to the further enhancement of the sao of microbial communities at higher tan concentrations phase iv no significantly up regulated proteins in the proteobacteria populations were detected and the expression of acetyl coa synthetase ec 6 2 1 1 acss1 2 of this phylum remained significantly inhibited phase iv vs phase iii which resulted in a decrease in the acetate metabolic activity of p proteobacteria fig 5b by contrast the high acetate metabolic activity of p firmicutes was maintained as indicated by the similar number of significantly up regulated proteins 11 and down regulated proteins 12 phase iv vs phase iii fig 5a as discussed above hydrogenotrophic methanogens were also enriched in phase iv given that saohm is an efficient metabolic pathway capable of mediating resistance to extreme ammonia concentrations wang et al 2022 the synergistic effects of the firmicutes populations and hydrogenotrophic methanogens were sufficient for mediating the acetate degradation which may account for the maintenance of the low acetate concentrations in the reactor 3 3 2 propionate metabolism propionate was first activated and then degraded via the methylmalonyl coa pathway mmc pathway and a total of 17 mmc related proteins were expressed fig 4 the impaired propionate metabolic activity of p proteobacteria was observed in phase ii as evidenced by the fact that 80 of the significant deps were down regulated proteins phase ii vs phase i fig 5b this was consistent with the absence of g smithella in phase ii in section 3 2 the propionate metabolic activity of p firmicutes was not affected by ammonia nitrogen as indicated by the similar number of significantly up regulated proteins 10 and down regulated proteins 9 phase ii vs phase i fig 5a however the extremely low abundance of this bacterium did not appear to compensate for the negative effect of the absence of the aforementioned dominant bacteria on the propionate degradation function of the community therefore propionate still accumulated in the reactor in phase iii the propionate metabolic activity of p proteobacteria remained severely inhibited and 92 31 of its significant deps were down regulated phase iii vs phase ii fig 5b however the number of significantly up regulated proteins derived from p firmicutes was 150 higher compared with the number of significantly up regulated proteins for the comparisons of samples collected in phases ii and i this coupled with the lack of a change in the number of significantly down regulated proteins fig 5a indicates that propionate metabolic activity in this taxon was enhanced this was consistent with the observation of many new mags in p firmicutes in phase iii in section 3 2 which also alleviated propionate accumulation in the reactor implying that the propionate degradation function of the community in this phase was mainly mediated by p firmicutes as the tan concentration further increased the propionate metabolic activity of both key taxa was inhibited for p firmicutes the number of significantly down regulated proteins was 133 33 higher in the phase iv vs phase iii comparison than in the phase iii vs phase ii comparison for example all deps were significantly down regulated in both succinyl coa synthetase ec 6 2 1 5 sucd and fumarate hydratase ec 4 2 1 2 fuma fig 5a zhang et al 2022 showed that high ammonia stress inhibited the expression of succinyl coa synthetase which in turn affected the syntrophic propionate oxidation process zhang et al 2020 also observed that propionate degrading bacteria g pelotomaculum belonging to the phylum firmicutes were resistant to ammonia stress at 3000 mg n l however these bacteria were inhibited at tan 6000 mg n l and this inhibition was irreversible for p proteobacteria the propionate metabolic activity was still inhibited the expression of acetyl coa synthetase methylmalonyl coa mutase ec 5 4 99 2 mut fumarate hydratase malate dehydrogenase ec 1 1 1 37 mdh1 and pyruvate carboxylase ec 6 4 1 1 pc was severely inhibited and the proportion of significantly down regulated proteins was 85 71 phase iv vs phase iii fig 5b liu et al 2021 also found that ammonia stress inhibited the expression of acetyl coa synthetase which was one of the reasons for the poor propionate degradation in the reactor therefore the impaired propionate metabolic activity of the key taxa may be the main reason for the high propionate accumulation in the reactor thus the absence of alternative functional proteins or pathways in the reactor made the domestication adaptation of propionate degradation function of the community significantly difficult or even impractical 3 3 3 butyrate and valerate metabolism butyrate was degraded mainly through the β oxidation pathway fig 4 the significant deps in p proteobacteria in the phase ii vs phase i comparison were all down regulated proteins fig 5b indicating that its butyrate metabolic activity was inhibited by ammonia this is consistent with the observation in section 3 2 that butyrate degrading bacteria s syntrophus aciditrophicus belonging to p proteobacteria were absent in phase ii by contrast most of the significant deps in p firmicutes which had a low abundance were up regulated proteins phase ii vs phase i fig 5a indicating that the butyrate metabolic activity of this population was enhanced similar to the propionate metabolism the butyrate metabolic functions of the microbial community mediated by non dominant bacteria p firmicutes were fragile in phase ii which led to the butyrate accumulation in the reactor in phase iii the butyrate metabolic activity of p proteobacteria was still severely inhibited the expression of enoyl coa hydratase ec 4 2 1 17 paaf 3 hydroxybutyryl coa dehydrogenase ec 1 1 1 157 paah and acetyl coa c acetyltransferase ec 2 3 1 9 acat continued to significantly decrease and the ratio of significantly down regulated proteins was 77 78 phase iii vs phase ii fig 5b by contrast the firmicutes population gradually adapted to the high ammonia conditions and the butyrate metabolic activity was further enhanced as evidenced by the fact that all significant deps for the phase iii vs phase ii comparison were up regulated proteins fig 5a this was also consistent with the observation that many new mags in the phylum firmicutes were observed in phase iii in section 3 2 these mags appeared to successfully replace the inhibited p proteobacteria to maintain the butyrate degradation function of the community which efficiently mediated the degradation of the butyrate that had accumulated in phase iii however p firmicutes cannot tolerate extremely high ammonia stress in phase iv the decreased activities of enoyl coa hydratase acetyl coa c acetyltransferase and acetate kinase in p firmicutes were observed thus the percentage of significantly down regulated proteins was 62 96 phase iv vs phase iii fig 5a by contrast the butyrate metabolic activity of p proteobacteria was resistant to ammonia as suggested by the fact that the numbers of significantly down regulated proteins 3 and significantly up regulated proteins 2 were similar for the phase iv vs phase iii comparison fig 5b this maintained the butyrate degradation function of the community and kept the butyrate concentration low similarly for the valerate degradation function of the community most of the significant deps in p firmicutes were up regulated proteins phase ii vs phase i enzymes with significantly enhanced activity included acetyl coa c acetyltransferase and acetate coa transferase ec 2 8 3 18 aarc fig 5a however the valerate metabolic activity of p proteobacteria was strongly inhibited by ammonia as evidenced by a significant decrease in the expression of isovaleryl coa dehydrogenase ec 1 3 8 4 ivo hydroxymethylglutaryl coa lyase ec 4 1 3 4 hmgcl acetyl coa c acetyltransferase and acetyl coa synthetase phase ii vs phase i fig 5b which resulted in the accumulation of valerate in phase iii the valerate degradation function of p proteobacteria showed resistance to ammonia as evidenced by the comparable numbers of significantly down regulated proteins and up regulated proteins phase iii vs phase ii fig 5b the valerate metabolic activity of p firmicutes was further enhanced all significant deps were up regulated proteins phase iii vs phase ii fig 5a the two key taxa together maintained the valerate degradation function of the community and a decrease in the valerate concentration was observed in the reactor in phase iv the valerate metabolic activity of p firmicutes was severely inhibited as evidenced by the fact that the number of significantly down regulated proteins was twice as high as the number of significantly up regulated proteins fig 5a however the valerate metabolic activity of p proteobacteria still showed resistance to ammonia as evidenced by the comparable number of significantly down regulated proteins and significantly up regulated proteins phase iv vs phase iii fig 5b which maintained the valerate degradation function of the community and thus the low valerate concentration in the reactor in sum diverse metabolic functions of the p firmicutes and p proteobacteria including acetate metabolism and lcvfa metabolism were observed in this study which confirmed the observation that firmicutes and proteobacteria members functioned differently as discussed in section 3 2 in phase ii the acetate degradation function of the community was mainly mediated by firmicutes populations their acetate metabolic activity decreased which in turn led to high acetate accumulation in the reactor however in phase iii p firmicutes gradually adapted to the ammonia stress conditions and their acetate metabolic activity recovered in addition the acetate metabolic activity of p proteobacteria was enhanced thus the accumulation of acetate in the reactor was alleviated in phase iv acetate metabolizing bacteria in the phylum proteobacteria were unable to tolerate the high ammonia stress therefore their acetate metabolic activity was decreased however the acetate metabolic activity of p firmicutes was resistant to ammonia this taxon thus maintained the acetate metabolic function of the community through synergistic interactions with hydrogenotrophic methanogens in comparison the lcvfa metabolic activity of p proteobacteria decreased under low ammonia stress phase ii the lcvfa metabolic activity of p firmicutes was not inhibited however because of their extremely low abundance this taxon was unable to fully offset the severely negative effect of the decrease in the lcvfa metabolic activity of the original dominant bacteria which resulted in lcvfa accumulation in the reactor the propionate and butyrate metabolic activity of p proteobacteria remained inhibited as the tan concentration increased phase iii however due to adaptation to high ammonia stress the propionate and butyrate metabolic activity of p firmicutes was further enhanced thus p firmicutes became the main functional bacteria mediating the propionate and butyrate metabolism of the microbial community which mediated the degradation of the propionate and butyrate that had accumulated in the reactor in contrast the valerate metabolic activity of both key taxa was not inhibited therefore a decrease in the valerate concentration was also observed the lcvfa metabolic activity of p firmicutes was strongly inhibited as ammonia stress further increased phase iv the expression of functional proteins related to the propionate metabolism of p proteobacteria was also severely inhibited by ammonia the butyrate and valerate metabolic activity of p proteobacteria showed resistance to ammonia which maintained the butyrate and valerate degradation functions of the microbial community given that the propionate metabolic activity of both key taxa was inhibited by ammonia the propionate metabolism of the community was impaired which might be the underlying cause of the severe propionate accumulation in the reactor under high ammonia stress and the subsequent decrease in methane yield 4 conclusions the key microorganisms responsible for process instability induced by high ammonia stress were p firmicutes and p proteobacteria both of which had exhibited lcvfa and acetate metabolic functions in this study functional redundancy was found as the main mechanism for the maintenance of the acetate butyrate and valerate degradation functions of the microbial community under ammonia stress in contrast the propionate metabolic function of both p firmicutes and p proteobacteria was severely inhibited by high ammonia stress which led to the severe impairment of the propionate metabolic function of the community the accumulation of propionate in the reactor and a decrease in the methane yield therefore the key metabolic link affecting ad performance under ammonia stress was considered as the syntrophic propionate oxidation in engineering applications it is necessary to actively develop alternative pathways for propionate metabolism within the nitrogen rich waste ad reactor such as inducing direct interspecies electron transfer as a substitute for the traditional syntrophic propionate oxidation which will assist in improving ad system performance and stability credit authorship
