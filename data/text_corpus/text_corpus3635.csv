18175,volunteer monitoring in the hudson river watershed since 2012 has identified that the wallkill river and rondout creek tributary complex have elevated concentrations of the fecal indicator bacteria enterococci concentrations of enterococci do not provide insight into the sources of pollution and are imperfect indicators of health risks in 2017 the regular monthly volunteer monitoring campaign for culturable enterococci at 24 sites on the wallkill and rondout expanded to include 1 culturable measurements of e coli and quantification of e coli and enterococcus specific markers vis nanoscale qpcr 2 microbial source tracking mst assays avian human bovine and equine via real time pcr and nanoscale qpcr and 3 quantification of 12 gastrointestinal pathogens including viruses bacteria and protozoa via nanoscale qpcr three human associated mst markers humm2 hf183 and b theta corroborated that human pollution was present in rondout creek and widespread in the wallkill river the presence of b theta was associated with increased concentrations of culturable e coli genes for adenovirus 40 and 41 conserved region rotavirus a nsp3 e coli eae and stx1 and giardia lamblia 18s rrna were detected in 45 of samples abundance of rotavirus a nsp3 genes was significantly correlated to the bovine marker gene cowm3 though wild bird sources cannot be ruled out this is the first

bacteria 1 introduction fecal pollution due to point and nonpoint sources is a concern in many watersheds the presence of fecal pollution is typically analyzed via culture based and molecular methods that measure the concentrations of either escherichia coli enterococci or fecal and total coliforms these fecal indicator bacteria fib are found in the fecal matter of warm blooded animals to guide remediation efforts in a watershed knowledge of the sources of pollution is essential microbial source tracking mst is a technique that uses real time pcr rt pcr and quantitative pcr qpcr methods to detect and quantify gene markers associated with microorganisms found in the feces of human or other specific animal species boehm et al 2013 cao et al 2018 harwood et al 2014 layton et al 2013 li et al 2019 recent studies have looked to relate gene copy levels for human mst markers with acceptable risk levels boehm et al 2015 harwood et al 2014 quantification of fib and mst markers do not provide direct information on the presence of waterborne pathogens previous studies point to the weaknesses in solely using fibs to estimate the risk of waterborne pathogens mcquaig et al 2012 wu et al 2011 statistical analysis of forty years of published water quality data has demonstrated that a single fecal indicator organism cannot reliably predict the risk of all three classes of waterborne pathogens viral bacterial and protozoal in recreational waters wu et al 2011 at a marine beach in southern california impacted by nonpoint pollution the risk of adenovirus was not correlated to the concentrations of culturable enterococci fecal coliforms or total coliforms mcquaig et al 2012 in a river in georgia usa concentrations of enterococcus spp 23s rrna and e coli spp 23s rrna were not correlated to salmonella spp inva and culturable campylobacter spp bradshaw et al 2016 goh et al 2019 recently observed weak or no correlations between fib and viral pathogens and between coliphages and viral pathogens in a two year sampling effort of tropical surface waters due to the variability between fib concentrations and pathogen levels there is a need to quantify pathogens directly direct quantification of pathogens is hampered by their wide diversity generally low concentrations and their spatial and temporal variability traditional qpcr assays detect only a few targets recently researchers have turned to high throughput qpcr techniques e g nanoscale qpcr ns qpcr to enumerate various molecular markers in a single water sample e g li et al 2016 with these molecular methods scientists can simultaneously analyze multiple water samples for multiple molecular targets creating a more complete picture of the magnitude and variability of pathogens in a watershed ns qpcr has been used to enumerate the concentrations of waterborne bacterial pathogens in recreational waters and roof harvested rainwater ahmed et al 2018 byappanahalli et al 2015 zhang et al 2016 the ns qpcr openarray platform has been used to detect the presence of viral bacterial and protozoal pathogens in nasal swabs and blood samples goodman et al 2016 grigorenko et al 2017 2014 these molecular workflows do not confirm viability of the detected pathogens correlations between culturable viable and qpcr based fib assays have been observed though noble et al 2010 shrestha and dorevitch 2019 and

discussed for e coli spp 23s rrna the hudson river watershed is a valuable drinking water and recreational resource new york state is currently undergoing restoration efforts to ensure that the water in the river and its tributaries can be used as source waters for drinking water and are safe to support water recreational activities since 2008 riverkeeper ossining ny based non profit has monitored concentrations of culturable enterococci in the hudson river monthly may october at 74 locations from new york harbor to waterford ny since 2012 riverkeeper and coordinated volunteers have monitored 38 additional sites in the rondout and wallkill tributaries another 3 wallkill sites were added in 2015 above the tidal boundary the wallkill river a large tributary with a large drainage and flow has exhibited some of the highest geometric mean concentrations of enterococci of all tributaries studied from 2012 to 2014 lipscomb et al 2015 from 2012 to 2018 90 of the 937 samples of ambient water collected from the wallkill watershed had fib levels that were higher than the epa s recommended bav of 60 cfu per 100 ml www riverkeeper org which we use herein as a measure of the swimmability of waters in the watersheds there is a need to investigate the risk of waterborne pathogens in this watershed from may to october 2017 we collected monthly water samples from twenty four sites along the wallkill river and rondout creek complex the objectives of our current study were to 1 examine potential sources human avian bovine and horse of fecal pollution in the watershed 2 evaluate how the concentrations of culturable fib were related to the presence of source associated markers rainfall and sampling location and 3 examine the presence and concentration of waterborne pathogens and relate this to the presence of source associated markers culturable concentrations of enterococci and e coli were measured and five real time pcr assays were used to determine the presence of human associated bacteroides 16s rrna hf183 human associated bacteroides thetaiotaomicron specific α 1 6 mannanase b theta haugland et al 2010 yampara iquise et al 2008 bovine associated and equine

the 10 l samples from the six wallkill sites was concentrated via tangential flow ultrafiltration as described in rhodes et al 2012 using a hollow fiber ultrafilter rexseed 25s asahi usa for each sampling date 10 l sterile nanopure water served as the negative processing control the samples were concentrated to a final volume of 300 ml of retentate to aid in virus precipitation bovine serum albumin at 0 001 w w 0 9 m sodium chloride and 0 012 w w polyethylene glycol were added to the retentate collected after the entire sample had been processed modified from polaczyk et al 2008 after overnight precipitation at 4 c the concentrated samples were centrifuged at 10 000 g for 30 min at 4 c the supernatant was decanted and the pelleted material was resuspended in 4 5 ml of sterile pbs distributed into 1 ml aliquots and stored at 80 c 2 2 4 nucleic acid extraction nucleic acids rna or dna were extracted from both the membrane filters and the 1 ml aliquots of the resuspended ultrafiltration retentate pellets following the manufacturer s protocol of dnaeasy powersoil dna extraction kit qiagen inc valencia ca an exogenous control bacteriophage ms2 atcc 15 597 b1 was added to the resuspended ultrafiltration retentate pellets prior to extraction to serve as an extraction and amplification control dreier et al 2005 the concentration of ms2 added to these samples was intended to result in cycle threshold ct values of 17 18 for the ms2 target on the ns qpcr platform the nucleic acid extracts were stored at 80 c 2 2 5 microbial source tracking real time polymerase

in an 18 3 format 18 targets with 3 technical replicates per sample each plate contained 48 subarrays to accommodate up to 48 samples per panel details on the ns qpcr workflow can be found in goodman et al 2016 briefly prior to the ns qpcr assays the extracted nucleic acid pool was first heated to 100 c for 5 min to denature rotavirus dsrna a pre amplification step including reverse transcription and amplification of the genetic markers was performed 15 min at 50 c 1 min at 95 c 20 cycles of 15 s at 95 c then 2 min at 60 c and 99 9 c for 10 min reagents for the pre amplification included a solution containing all primers of the ns qpcr assays at 0 6 μm taqman fast virus 1 step master mix thermofisher and the extracted nucleic acids the pre amplified samples were diluted 1 5 in te buffer to avoid non specific amplification from the pre amp primer pool each diluted pre amplified sample was mixed with taqman openarray real time pcr master mix thermofisher at a ratio of 1 1 and loaded onto the ns qpcr plates for amplification using the accufill instrument the openarray qpcr platform uses a quantitation algorithm based on the shape of each curve as opposed to a crossing point readout referred to as ct value in this paper for consistency nucleic acids extracted from each sample were independently pre amplified and run in duplicate or triplicate on different plates if at least one independent replicate was above detection or above the lowest quantifiable standard lqs for that target the sample was considered to be above detection or above lqs for that target a non template control nanopure water was also run on each plate and was negative for 17 of 18 targets enterococcus spp was the only target detected at 53 7 36 copies per 100 ml across all four runs which was lower than the lowest quantifiable standard for that target table s6 reference standards for the 17 targets used in the ns qpcr panel were obtained as either genomic dna salmonella spp control

kit the norovirus viral dna was obtained as a plasmid and linearized using the scai hf enzyme prior to in vitro transcription the standards were pooled into two standard pools at 106 copies per μl and then each standard pool was diluted with a 1 1 by volume mix of commercial nucleic acid dilution buffer thermo fisher and te buffer via serial dilution to obtain concentrations ranging from 100 to 106 copies per μl ms2 bacteriophage was spiked into the standard pools at a concentration intended to result in ct readings of 17 18 for the ms2 target on the ns qpcr panels standards were run on each ns qpcr panel data on the efficiency linearity r2 and lqs for each standard can be found in table s6 2 3 statistical analyses we examined correlations between the ns qpcr target concentrations of the six sampling sites across each of the sampling events using the pearson correlation matrix via the rmcorr package in r version 3 3 2 r core team 2017 a heatmap displaying mean ns qpcr target

statistics for windows version 22 0 ibm corp armonk ny linear mixed models evaluated the associations of concentrations of culturable enterococci or e coli with fixed effect variables such as the presence of specific mst markers site location nested in tributary sampling month four day total rainfall turbidity of the water concentration of culturable fecal indicator organism e g e coli if enterococci was the dependent variable and vice versa and mean daily air temperature at each site models were selected by the lowest akaike information criterion aic value and alternative models that

associations were determined at alpha 0 05 and the estimated means and confidence intervals were reported 3 results 3 1 site conditions and culturable fib data we conducted monthly water quality monitoring may october 2017 at 24 sites in wallkill river and rondout creek two arms of a large tributary complex of the hudson river fig 1a in both tributaries monitoring of cultural concentrations of e coli and enterococci found that the bav for enterococci was more frequently exceeded than the bav for e coli table 1 figs s2 and s3 the wallkill river had higher enterococci concentrations than the rondout table 1 fig s2 the august sampling event had the highest mean rainfall and mean concentrations of enterococci and e coli table 1 figs s2 and s3 3 2 microbial source tracking with singleplex rt pcr assays we conducted singleplex rt pcr microbial source tracking assays using five mst markers to determine potential sources of fib in the watershed many samples were positive but below the lowest quantifiable standard for the target table s4 therefore the data was evaluated qualitatively presence or absence at the 24 sites surveyed across the six months 144 sampling events gfd was most frequently detected 59 7 of samples followed by hf183 33 3 and b theta 22 2 tables s7 and s8 one site in the rondout rc 31 55 and six sites in the wallkill wr 68 80 wr 61 61 quck wr 25 86 sk us wr 10 76 had either or both human markers observed in four or more months fig 2 table s8 cowm3 was detected in only 11 of the 144 sampling events 7 6 with the majority 6 occurring in the month of july only two locations in the wallkill had multiple months of bovine signal detection in two months for ruck and wr 68 80 table s9 out of all the sampling events the equine marker was only observed twice at two sites in the rondout rc bk 0 14 and rc 11 43 in july data not shown we evaluated how frequently each mst marker occurred by itself or in combination with other markers for the 144 sampling events table 2 the most frequently occurring event was only gfd was detected 29 9 frequency table 2 table s7 indicates the specific sample months when this occurred the second most frequently occurring combination was that gfd was detected with either or both hf183 and b theta 26 4 frequency table 2 these samples included those from one site in the upper wallkill quck in all months and one site in the lower wallkill wr 10 76 in five out of six months fig 2 the third most frequently observed result was no mst markers were detected 25 7 frequency table 2 july and september saw the highest number of no detects 10 and 9 sites with no detects respectively august the sampling event with the highest rainfall saw the fewest number of no detects only 3 out of 24 sites table s10 most sites had

theta were the only markers detected table 2 table s8 this was observed the most frequently at wr 25 86 and wr 18 64 in 3 out of 6 months cowm3 was detected by itself in only 4 sampling events which all occurred in the months of june at rc 41 35 and july wr sk 0 49 wr 11 56 wr 10 63 table 2 table s9 3 3 associations between culturable fib concentrations and presence of rt pcr mst markers we conducted a linear mixed model analysis to determine which fixed effects tributary site sampling month turbidity of water four day total rainfall in mean air temperature c log concentration of the corresponding culturable fib and the presence of gfd b theta hf183 and cowm3 in the singleplex rt pcr assays were associated with log concentrations of culturable enterococci or e coli table 3 there was only one model for enterococci and it was selected for further evaluation the wallkill tributary had significantly larger concentration of log enterococci p 0 001 estimated mean 2 85 95 ci 2 718 2 983 than rondout the presence of gfd was associated with larger log concentrations of enterococci p 0 005 estimate mean 2 686 95 ci 2 559 2 814 the sampling month was also significantly associated with log concentrations of enterococci p 0 001 the sampling event in may had significantly lower concentration of enterococci estimated mean 2 013 95 ci 1 785 2 240 and was significantly lower than the enterococci concentrations in the other sampling months the july sampling event had the largest concentration of enterococci estimated mean 2 909 95 ci 2 727 3 092 and was significantly larger than the sampling event in may the four day total rainfall was also associated with larger concentration of enterococci p 0 005 there were three linear mixed models that effectively evaluated the associations of log concentrations of e coli e coli models a b and c table 3 of the three models model b was selected for further evaluation because the presence of b theta was included as an independent variable the presence of b theta was associated with higher log concentrations of e coli p 0 135 estimated mean 2 295 95 ci 2 097 2 493 samples taken in the wallkill river had significantly larger log concentrations of e coli p 0 001 estimated mean 2 485 95 ci 2 328 2 642 the month of each sampling event was also significantly associated with log concentrations of e coli p 0 001 the august sampling event had the largest concentration of culturable e coli estimated mean 2 742 95 ci 2 420 3 065 and was significantly larger than the log concentrations in of e coli in the may september and october sampling events estimated means 1 937 2 050 2 000 respectively p 0 01 0 001 0 03 respectively 95 ci 1 700 2 174 1 790 2 311 1 755 2 245 respectively the may sampling event had the lowest concentration of culturable e coli estimated mean 1 937 95 ci 1 700 2 174 and was significantly lower than the log concentrations of e coli in the sampling events in july and august estimated means 2 477 and 2 742 respectively p 0 001 and 0 01 respectively 95 ci 2 276 2 678 and 2 420 3 065 respectively the four day total rainfall was also significantly associated with the log concentration of e coli p 0 029 3 4 high throughput ns qpcr panel results for the ns qpcr analyses we sampled six sites fig 1 along the more polluted wallkill river in five months may june july august and october some of the targets on the ns qpcr panel were detected more frequently and at higher concentrations than others fig 3 a and b in terms of the fecal indicator bacteria enterococcus spp 23s rrna and general e coli unknown gene were detected in all samples fig 3b but enterococcus spp 23s rrna mean concentration across all samples was higher than e coli unknown gene fig 3a the bav was exceeded in 93 3 and 36 6 of samples for culturable enterococci and e coli respectively table s11 for the mst markers on the ns qpcr panel humm2 was detected in 96 7 of samples cowm3 was detected in 56 7 of samples and poultry associated marker brevibacterium spp la35 16s rrna was never detected in any samples fig 3a and b cowm3 was detected more frequently on the ns qpcr panels than in the singleplex rt pcr assays only in 10 of samples due to the lower detection limit of the ns qpcr panel fig 3 table s6 and table s9 in terms of the six bacterial pathogens e coli eae was detected the most frequently 93 3 of samples then campylobacter spp 53 5 e coli o157 rfbe 20 e coli stx1 13 3 salmonella spp 10 and shigella spp ipah 3 3 fig 3b neither the salmonella spp or shigella spp target were detected above their lqs 9 3 or 5 7 copies per 100 ml respectively fig 3a in terms of the five viral pathogens rotavirus a nsp3 was detected the most frequently 93 3 then adenovirus type 40 41 56 7 and norovirus group ii qnif2d cog2r 26 7 enterovirus highly conserved 5 noncoding region and hepatitis a highly conserved 5 noncoding region were never detected in any of the samples fig 3 the protozoal pathogen giardia lamblia 18s rrna was detected in 46 7 of samples fig 3b ms2 was added as an internal amplification control to all our experimental ns qpcr samples prior to nucleic acid extraction to our standard pools and to two experimental samples after nucleic acid extraction we frequently did not detect ms2 rep in our samples where ms2 was added prior to extraction whereas ms2 rep was detected in the standard pools and the other two samples where additional ms2 was added after extraction table s12 this suggests that suboptimal titration prior to nucleic acid extraction as well as inhibition during ns qpcr may have been the cause for internal control failure in our samples we also examined the reproducibility of replicates on the open array panels data not shown for all the enterococcus spp 23s rrna assays run we observed an average 7 relative standard deviation rsd for triplicate technical qpcr replicates run on the same open array panel an average 68 rsd for nucleic acid extract samples run on multiple open array panels independent replicates and an average 57 rsd between biological replicates the marker for norovirus group ii qnif2d cog2r was detected at all sites in october and at wr 68 80 in may and july fig 4 we observed some spatial patterns in target occurrence at wr 10 76 the sampling site furthest downstream wallkill river we saw increases in the concentrations of enterococcus spp 23s rrna humm2 e coli eae e coli general unknown gene during the june and october sampling events fig 4 fig s4 the two sampling events with the highest concentrations of cowm3 and high rotavirus concentrations occurred in the two most upstream sites on the wallkill wr 68 80 and wr 61 61 in the wet sampling events in july and august fig s4 fig 4 table 1 a heatmap was constructed to visualize concentrations of the fib mst markers and pathogen targets on the ns qpcr panel at the six wallkill sites across the five months fig 4 we observed grouping of the humm2 marker with e coli eae and the e coli spp general marker whereas the cowm3 marker grouped with e coli stx1 and e coli o157 rfbe fig 4 and s4 we observed a positive correlation between the concentrations of rotavirus a nsp3 and cowm3 in our samples r 0 659 95 ci 0 339 0 842 whereas no correlation was observed between the rotavirus and humm2 concentrations r 0 023 95 ci 0 431 0 393 fig 5 and s5 positive correlations were found between the concentrations of humm2 e coli eae and the general e coli spp gene as well as between cowm3 and e coli stx1 and e coli o157 rfbe fig 5 and s5 4 discussion in our study the culturable concentrations of enterococci and e coli frequently exceeded the bav indicating that waters may not be safe for swimming especially in the wallkill river table 1 in 5 out of 30 sampling events the average ns qpcr based concentrations for enterococcus spp 23s rrna exceeded the recommended recreational water quality criteria in epa method 1611 1 9600 gene copies per 100 ml us epa 2012 fig 3 whereas all 30 out of 30 samples had culturable enterococci above the bav level of 60 cfu per 100 ml table 1 rt pcr assay results indicate that human and especially bird mst markers were the most frequently detected mst markers in the watershed table 2 our mixed model analysis found that the presence of gfd marker which targets the feces of wild birds and poultry was significantly associated with higher log concentrations of culturable enterococci table 3 nguyen et al 2018 also used the gfd marker and found that birds were the major source of fecal pollution in a florida watershed managed for wildlife conservation we never detected poultry associated brevibacterium spp la35 16s rrna in the ns qpcr panel however the amplicon size 571 bp was not ideal for ns qpcr which may have adversely impacted the detection limit debode et al 2017 we ran three different human mst marker assays hf183 and b theta via rt pcr and humm2 via ns qpcr the epa has recently published methods for the hf183 and humm2 assays methods 1696 and 1697 respectively us epa 2019a 2019b in our singleplex rt pcr assays hf183 was detected more frequently than b theta similarly layton et al 2013 found that hf183 had increased sensitivity compared to b theta in sewage spiked river water boehm et al 2015 suggested that a 30 in 1000 swimmers risk level corresponds to 4200 and 2800 gene copies per 100 ml for hf183 and humm2 respectively in recreational beaches contaminated with raw sewage the majority of samples in our dataset had humm2 levels below the suggested limit only 2 out of 30 sampling events were above the limit fig 3 the fact that the culture based bavs were more frequently exceeded than the qpcr based recommended bavs humm2 and enterococcus spp 23s rrna could be due to some degree of partial inhibition in ns qpcr reactions leading to an underestimation of actual marker concentrations in 22 7 of sampling events the bav for either or both of the culturable fibs were exceeded but none of the rt pcr mst assays were positive the mst markers could be present but below our detection limits or other sources of feces could be contributing to fib concentrations in the watershed e g dog deer additionally culturable fibs can be more persistent than mst markers especially for mst assays targeting obligate anaerobes such as bacteroidetes dick et al 2010 fibs can persist and reproduce in sediments in the hudson estuary o mullan et al 2019 resuspension of existing fibs from the sediment may partially explain our relatively high concentrations of culturable fib despite a lack of detection of mst markers in our monitoring of twelve waterborne pathogens at a subset of six wallkill river sites via ns qpcr assays rotavirus a nps3 was the most frequently detected along with e coli eae and most abundant pathogen fig 3 we do not know the source s of rotavirus in our samples as rotavirus can originate from many different animal sources further genome sequencing of our samples will enable us to pinpoint the possible source s byappanahalli et al 2015 examined pathogenic bacteria in water algae and sand samples from lake michigan and observed that e coli eae was the most frequently observed pathogenic marker in their watershed adenovirus type 40 41 vtb1 hadvf and giardia lamblia 18s rrna were also detected relatively frequently in our study 45 of samples were positive while we found more occasional detection of norovirus e coli o157 rfbe and e coli stx1 5 conclusions variability in the available assessment methods used to determine whether water meets recreational water quality standards was noted with culturable enterococci triggering the greatest percentage of poor quality samples followed by culturable e coli then ns qpcr based enterococcus spp 23s rrna quantification and finally ns qpcr based humm2 quantification rt pcr results suggest a mixture of natural wild bird and anthropogenic sources of fecal pollution are at play in the wallkill rondout tributary of the hudson river with detection of bird mst correlated strongly with culturable enterococci and a human marker b theta correlating with culturable e coli ns qpcr openarray qpcr arrays data support the grouping of general e coli spp gene concentrations and human mst humm2 gene concentrations mitigation of fecal pollution in the wallkill should focus on human pollution especially in the highly and consistently polluted quaker creek tributary of the 12 pathogens monitored using ns qpcr only a few were consistently detected and quantifiable in the wallkill samples rotavirus e coli eae adenovirus type 40 41 and giardia lamblia these organisms and norovirus which was only widespread in october merit a risk assessment to determine the public health risk of

concentrations of culturable enterococci in the hudson river monthly may october at 74 locations from new york harbor to waterford ny since 2012 riverkeeper and coordinated volunteers have monitored 38 additional sites in the rondout and wallkill tributaries another 3 wallkill sites were added in 2015 above the tidal boundary the wallkill river a large tributary with a large drainage and flow has exhibited some of the highest geometric mean concentrations of enterococci of all tributaries studied from 2012 to 2014 lipscomb et al 2015 from 2012 to 2018 90 of the 937 samples of ambient water collected from the wallkill watershed had fib levels that were higher than the epa s recommended bav of 60 cfu per 100 ml www riverkeeper org which we use herein as a measure of the swimmability of

wallkill river and rondout creek complex the objectives of our current study were to 1 examine potential sources human avian bovine and horse of fecal pollution in the watershed 2 evaluate how the concentrations of culturable fib were related to the presence of source associated markers rainfall and sampling location and 3 examine the presence and concentration of waterborne pathogens and relate this to the presence of source associated markers culturable concentrations of enterococci and e coli were measured and five real time pcr assays were used to determine the presence of human

to avoid non specific amplification from the pre amp primer pool each diluted pre amplified sample was mixed with taqman openarray real time pcr master mix thermofisher at a ratio of 1 1 and loaded onto the ns qpcr plates for amplification using the accufill instrument the openarray qpcr platform uses a quantitation algorithm based on the shape of each curve as opposed to a crossing point readout referred to as ct value in this paper for consistency nucleic acids extracted from each sample were independently pre amplified and run in duplicate or triplicate on different plates if at least one independent replicate was above detection or above the lowest quantifiable standard lqs for that target the sample was considered to be above detection or above lqs for that target a non

and october some of the targets on the ns qpcr panel were detected more frequently and at higher concentrations than others fig 3 a and b in terms of the fecal indicator bacteria enterococcus spp 23s rrna and general e coli unknown gene were detected in all samples fig 3b but enterococcus spp 23s rrna mean concentration across all samples was higher than e coli unknown gene fig 3a the bav was exceeded in 93 3 and 36 6 of samples for culturable enterococci and e coli respectively table s11 for the mst markers on the ns qpcr panel humm2 was detected in 96 7 of samples cowm3 was detected in 56 7 of samples and poultry associated marker brevibacterium spp la35 16s rrna was never detected in any samples fig 3a and b cowm3 was detected more frequently on the ns qpcr panels than in the singleplex rt pcr assays only in 10 of samples due to the lower detection limit of the ns qpcr panel fig 3 table s6 and table s9 in terms of the six bacterial pathogens e coli eae was detected the

were detected above their lqs 9 3 or 5 7 copies per 100 ml respectively fig 3a in terms of the five viral pathogens rotavirus a nsp3 was detected the most frequently 93 3 then adenovirus type 40 41 56 7 and norovirus group ii qnif2d cog2r 26 7 enterovirus highly conserved 5 noncoding region and hepatitis a highly conserved 5 noncoding region were never detected in any of the samples fig 3 the protozoal pathogen giardia lamblia 18s rrna was detected in 46 7 of samples fig 3b ms2 was added as an internal amplification control to all our experimental ns qpcr samples prior to nucleic acid extraction to our standard pools and to two experimental samples after nucleic acid extraction we frequently did not detect ms2 rep in our samples where ms2 was added prior to extraction whereas ms2 rep was detected in the standard pools and the other two samples where additional ms2 was added after extraction table s12 this suggests that suboptimal titration prior to nucleic acid extraction as well as inhibition during ns qpcr may have been the cause for internal control failure in our samples we also examined the reproducibility of replicates on the open array panels data not shown for all the enterococcus spp 23s rrna assays run we observed an average 7 relative standard deviation rsd for triplicate technical qpcr replicates run on the same open array panel an average 68 rsd for nucleic acid extract samples run on multiple open array panels independent replicates and an average 57 rsd between biological replicates the marker for norovirus group ii qnif2d cog2r was detected at all sites in october and at wr 68 80 in may and july fig 4 we observed some spatial patterns in target occurrence at wr 10 76 the sampling site furthest downstream wallkill river we saw increases in the concentrations of enterococcus spp 23s rrna humm2 e coli eae e coli general unknown gene during the june and october sampling events fig 4 fig s4 the two sampling events with the highest concentrations of cowm3 and high rotavirus concentrations occurred in the two most upstream sites on the wallkill wr 68 80 and wr 61 61 in the wet sampling events in july and august fig s4 fig 4 table 1 a heatmap was constructed to visualize concentrations of the fib mst markers and pathogen targets on the ns qpcr panel at the six wallkill sites across the five months fig 4 we observed grouping of the humm2 marker with e coli eae and the e coli spp general marker whereas the cowm3 marker grouped with e coli stx1 and e coli o157 rfbe fig 4 and s4 we observed a positive correlation between the concentrations of rotavirus a nsp3 and cowm3 in our samples r 0 659 95 ci 0 339 0 842 whereas no correlation was observed between the rotavirus and humm2 concentrations r 0 023 95 ci 0 431 0 393 fig 5 and s5 positive correlations were found between the concentrations of humm2 e coli eae and the general e coli spp gene as well as between cowm3 and e coli stx1 and e coli o157 rfbe fig 5 and s5 4 discussion in our study the culturable concentrations of enterococci and e coli frequently exceeded the bav indicating that waters may not be safe for swimming especially in the wallkill river table 1 in 5 out of 30 sampling events the average ns qpcr based concentrations for enterococcus spp 23s rrna exceeded the recommended recreational water quality criteria in epa method 1611 1 9600 gene copies per 100 ml us epa 2012 fig 3 whereas all 30 out of 30 samples had culturable enterococci above the bav level of 60 cfu per 100 ml table 1 rt pcr assay results indicate that human and especially bird mst markers were the most frequently detected mst markers in the watershed table 2 our mixed model analysis found that the presence of gfd marker which targets the feces of wild birds and poultry was significantly associated with higher log concentrations of culturable enterococci table 3 nguyen et al 2018 also used the gfd marker and found that birds were the major source of fecal pollution in a florida watershed managed for wildlife conservation we never detected poultry associated brevibacterium spp la35 16s rrna in the ns qpcr panel however the amplicon size 571 bp was not ideal for ns qpcr which may have adversely impacted the detection limit debode et al 2017 we ran three different human mst marker assays hf183 and b theta via rt pcr and humm2 via ns qpcr the epa has recently published methods for the hf183 and humm2 assays methods 1696 and 1697 respectively us epa 2019a 2019b in our singleplex rt pcr assays hf183 was detected more frequently than b theta similarly layton et al 2013 found that hf183 had increased sensitivity compared to b theta in sewage spiked river water boehm et al 2015 suggested that a 30 in 1000 swimmers risk level corresponds to 4200 and 2800 gene copies per 100 ml for hf183 and humm2 respectively in recreational beaches contaminated with raw sewage the majority of samples in our dataset had humm2 levels below the suggested limit only 2 out of 30 sampling events were above the limit fig 3 the fact that the culture based bavs were more frequently exceeded than the qpcr based recommended bavs humm2 and enterococcus spp 23s rrna could be due to some degree of partial inhibition in ns qpcr reactions leading to an underestimation of actual marker concentrations in 22 7 of sampling events the bav for either or both of the culturable fibs were exceeded but none of the rt pcr mst assays were positive the mst markers could be present but below our detection limits or other sources of feces could be contributing to fib concentrations in the watershed e g dog deer additionally culturable fibs can be more persistent than mst markers especially for mst assays targeting obligate anaerobes such as bacteroidetes dick et al 2010 fibs can persist and reproduce in sediments in the hudson estuary o mullan et al 2019 resuspension of existing fibs from the sediment may partially explain our relatively high concentrations of culturable fib despite a lack of detection of mst markers in our monitoring of twelve waterborne pathogens at a subset of six wallkill river sites via ns qpcr assays rotavirus a nps3 was the most frequently detected along with e coli eae and most abundant pathogen fig 3 we do not know the source s of rotavirus in our samples as rotavirus can originate from many different animal sources further genome sequencing of our samples will enable us to pinpoint the possible source s byappanahalli et al 2015 examined pathogenic bacteria in water algae and sand samples from lake michigan and observed that e coli eae was the most frequently observed pathogenic marker in their watershed adenovirus type 40 41 vtb1 hadvf and giardia lamblia 18s rrna were also detected relatively frequently in our study 45 of samples were positive while we found more occasional detection of norovirus e coli o157 rfbe and e coli stx1 5 conclusions variability in the available assessment methods used to determine whether water meets recreational water quality standards was noted with culturable enterococci triggering the greatest percentage of poor quality samples followed by culturable e coli then ns qpcr based enterococcus spp 23s rrna quantification and finally ns qpcr based humm2 quantification rt pcr results suggest a mixture of natural wild bird and anthropogenic sources of fecal pollution are at play in the wallkill rondout tributary of the hudson river with detection of bird mst correlated strongly with culturable enterococci and a human marker b theta correlating with culturable e coli ns qpcr openarray qpcr arrays data support the grouping of general e coli spp gene concentrations and human mst humm2 gene concentrations mitigation of fecal pollution in the wallkill should focus on human pollution especially in the highly and consistently polluted quaker creek tributary of the 12 pathogens monitored using ns qpcr only a few were consistently detected and quantifiable in the wallkill samples rotavirus e coli eae adenovirus type 40 41 and giardia lamblia these organisms and norovirus which was only widespread in october merit a risk assessment to determine the public health risk of recreational contact with the wallkill river waters some pathogens were strongly correlated with specific mst markers rotavirus a with the cowm3 marker and e coli eae with the humm2 marker declaration

18176,disinfection by products dbps precursors can be regarded mainly from the drinking water sources and the water treatment processes a recent study showed that dissolved organic matter dom in atmosphere is an important precursor source of dbps through atmospheric wet deposition however little information is available on the characteristics of dom derived from dry deposition particulate matter pm and the impact of dry deposition on cx3r type dbp formation this study determined whether dry deposition directly contributed the production of dbps during chlor am ination and investigated the mechanism behind the contribution based on the combination of the resin and membrane for fractionating dom fractions the results showed that the hydrophilic fraction hpi contributed the most dom and low molecular weight dom 10 kda was the main component of hpi in addition aromatic proteins and soluble microbial products like compounds were the dominant fluorescent species in dom derived from pm and 10 kda transphilic was the most abundant the concentrations of c dbps and n dbps in disinfected pm solution were trihalomethanes thms haloacetic acids haas haloaldehydes and haloacetamides haloacetonitriles halonitromethanes for both chlorination and chloramination the main contributors of calculated toxicity are transphilic and hydrophobic in chlorination and chloramination respectively dry deposition pm was deduced to contribute dom and dbp formation after chlorination in surface water especially thms and haas these results presented herein provide key information for

their similar molecular structure which have been extensively studied in previous studies for their high detection rates concentrations and toxicities in finished water richardson et al 2007 chu et al 2012 zhang et al 2017 atmospheric deposition plays an important role in carbon cycle fowler et al 2009 kuang et al 2016 recently many studies found that the organic matters derived from atmosphere will increase concentrations of dom in surface water sources through precipitation gao et al 2018 warner and saros 2019 xing et al 2019 however dry deposition especially particulate matters pm deposition as another way transporting atmospheric organic matters to the surface water sources may have important implications for the contribution of dom in water sources according to a previous study jacobson et al 2000 pm contained abundant organic matters for instance ti et al 2018 found that the contribution of atmospheric dry deposition to the total don of taihu lake was 1 4 indicating that dry deposition especially pm deposition can be an important source of dom in surface water sources therefore there is a contact opportunity for dom in pm and disinfectants during disinfection process for wet deposition precipitation only one study examined the contribution of atmospheric dom from wet deposition to the formation of dbps hou et al 2018 however till now little has been known about the effect of atmospheric pm from dry deposition on the formation and the toxicity of dbps which is necessary to be estimated considering that dry deposition is also an important pathway transporting atmospheric dom to drinking water sources dom is a complex organic mixture with a broad spectrum of molecular weights functional groups distributions it is vital to isolate the dom into more homogeneous groups based on different chemical or physical properties such as size structure and functionality to better understand the formation mechanism of dbps and finally achieve good control effect among various isolation methods resin fractionation and membrane filtration are the most commonly adopted methods chen et al 2014 han et al 2015 pan et al 2016 an et al 2017 zhang et al 2018 in the past resin fractionation and membrane filtration were used respectively for obtaining the hydrophobicity and molecular weight mw distribution of dom in drinking water sources however no information is available concerning the combination of resin fractionation and membrane filtration to further fractionate dom it is possible to get more detailed information concerning characteristics of dom and dbps precursors due to further refine the dom based on hydrophobicity and mw this study attempted to apply the combination of resin fractionation and membrane filtration to fractionate dom from atmosphere pm for the first time this novelty in this study can be seen clearly and detailly in fig s1 supporting information the objectives of this study were to 1 determine the contribution of atmospheric dry deposition on dom and the production of dbps during chlor am ination in surface water 2 investigate the characteristics of dom fractions from atmospheric dry deposition pm 3 assess the formation potential fp of cx3r type dbps thms haas hals hans hnms and hams formed from atmospheric dry deposition dom 4 evaluate the integrated risk of these cx3r type dbps and the contribution of dry deposition pm to the dbps toxicity the results presented herein would provide key information for dwtps to control dbps from the perspectives of atmospheric dry deposition especially in the case of heavy air pollution 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemicals and materials cx3r type dbps standard solutions including thms haas hals hans hnms and hams were purchased from supelco st louis missouri usa xad 4 and xad 8 resins were purchased from sigma aldrich a set of stirred millipore ultra filtration cells model 8400 and ultra filtration membranes with molecular size cut offs at 100 kda 10 kda and 1 kda were obtained from usa millipore potassium dihydrogen phosphate kh2po4 and dipotassium hydrogen phosphate k2hpo4 were supplied by sigma aldrich usa sodium hypochlorite naocl and nitric acid hno3 were obtained from sinopharm chemical reagent co shanghai china methyl tert butyl ether was purchased from aladdin industrial inc shanghai china other information is available in supplementary material all other chemicals were obtained from sinopharm chemical reagent co ltd shanghai china and were of analytical grade unless otherwise noted 2 2 experimental procedures 2 2 1 natural dry deposition in order to determine the contribution of atmospheric dry deposition on dom in surface water sources and dbp formation during disinfection a natural dry deposition experiment was carried out three sampling basins filled with 2 l of fresh ultrapure water as parallel samples were placed at the roof of the mingjing building shanghai for 24 h to naturally collect the atmospheric dry deposition afterwards the water with atmospheric dom was stirred by a magnetic stirrer with a speed of 150 r min to ensure a complete mixing state and then filtered through 0 45 μm glass fiber filters for water parameters analysis as well as the subsequent disinfection experiment which can be found in section 2 2 3 2 2 2 dom fractionation in order to quickly collect more pm for subsequent research resin and membrane fractionation three total pm samplers zr 3920c junray qingdao were mounted on the roof of the mingjing building in the campus of tongji university yangpu shanghai china and to collect pm total pm derived dom solutions were prepared as follows total pm were collected on the quartz microfiber filters with pore diameter of 1 6 μm 1851 090 whatman england and the total mass of pm was approximately 78 mg three filters were rinsed using ultrapure water for three times respectively and then all the solutions containing isolated particles were transferred into the corresponding beakers and finally additional ultrapure water was further added into the beaker until its solution volume reached 1 l solution was then stirred by a magnetic stirrer with a speed of 150 r min to ensure a complete mixing state the mixing process proceeded for 24 h to guarantee sufficient dissolution of pm derived dom then total pm derived dom solutions were filtered through 0 45 μm glass fiber filters finally 3 l pm derived dom solutions were concentrated to 1 l by a reverse osmosis unit which can contain the majority of dom zhao et al 2006 pressman et al 2012 concentrated dom solution was stored in the dark at 4 c until use the storage time of all solutions was no longer than 7 days characteristics of concentrated dom solutions derived from pm are presented in table s1 a portion of concentrated dom solutions derived from pm was acidified to ph 2 using sulfuric acid and then passed through xad 8 resin followed by xad 4 resin the effluent from the xad 4 resin was referred to as the hydrophilic fraction hpi the fraction adsorbed by xad 8 resin and subsequently back eluted from the resin column using sodium hydroxide solution with ph 11 was referred to as the hydrophobic fraction hpo the xad 4 resin retained organic compounds comprising the transphilic fraction tpi and were also eluted using the same sodium hydroxide solution in the reverse direction the ph of the three fractions was adjusted to 7 using sulfuric acid or sodium hydroxide and the volume of all fractions was adjusted to the initial sample volume using ultrapure water the detailed hydrophobicity fractionation procedure can be found in previous studies hua and reckhow 2007 chu et al 2010 han et al 2015 then the water samples with different hydrophilicities were fractionated using a 400 ml stirred cell millipore us with millipore ultrafiltration membranes amicon billerica ma with mw cut offs of 100 kda 10 kda and 1 kda respectively usually the threshold value between high and low mw organic matter is 10 kda liu et al 2012 1 kda and 100 kda of dom represent even lower and higher mw organic matter the detailed mw fractionation procedure can be found in previous studies hua and reckhow 2007 chu et al 2014 han et al 2015 finally dbp fp tests were carried out for the separated twelve fractions and the details can be found in section 2 2 3 2 2 3 dbp fp tests dbp fp tests were performed in 40 ml amber glass volumetric bottles under headspace free conditions in the dark at a temperature controlled 25 0 0 5 c room based on the procedure reported in previous studies krasner et al 2004 zhang et al 2017 the disinfectant dosages for dbp fp tests were chlorine cl2 3 doc mg l 7 6 nh3 n mg l 10 mg l the fresh monochloramine nh2cl solutions were prepared in advance following the procedures of mitch mitch and sedlak 2002 and nh2cl dosage 3 doc mg l 2 3 analytical methods some general parameters such as uv vis dissolved organic carbon doc don and specific ultraviolet absorbance suva can be used to predict the amount and characterization of dom hua et al 2015 uv absorbance at 254 nm suva254 and 285 nm suva285 were measured using a uv vis spectrophotometer uv 9000s metash instrument shanghai to characterize the aromaticity of dom which were calculated by dividing the uv absorbance at 254 nm and 285 nm by solution doc respectively three dimensional spectrofluorometry f 7100 fluorescence hitachi japan has been widely used to characterize different functional groups and sources of dom han et al 2015 li et al 2020 fluorescence scans λex 200 450 nm λem 220 550 nm was performed with 5 nm slits for excitation and emission doc and total dissolved nitrogen tdn were measured using a toc analyzer shimadzu toc vcph japan the detection limits of doc and tdn were 0 1 mg l concentrations of different dissolved inorganic nitrogen din species i e nh3 n no3 and no2 were measured using their respective hach test kits with a uv vis spectrophotometer hach dr6000 the detection limits of nh3 n no3 and no2 were 0 02 mg l 0 002 mg l and 0 1 mg l respectively don is the difference between tdn and din thms including dichloromethane dcm trichloromethane tcm hans including dichloroacetonitrile dcan and trichloroacetonitrile tcan hnms including dichloronitromethane dcnm and trichloronitromethane tcnm hams including dichloroacetamide dcam trichloroacetamide tcam and hals including dichloroacetaldehyde dcal and trichloroacetaldehyde ch were detected using gas chromatography electron capture detection gc ecd qp2010plus shimadzu corporation japan haas including chloroacetic acid dichloroacetic acid dcaa and trichloroacetic acid tcaa were measured with a gas chromatography mass spectrometer gc ms qp2020 shimadzu corporation japan detailed information on the analytical methods of these cx3r type dbps were presented elsewhere hou et al 2018 zhang et al 2019a 2019b 3 results and discussion 3 1 dbp formation from natural dry deposition the results of dbp formation during the disinfection of ultra pure water with and without atmospheric dry deposition dom are shown in fig 1 as is shown in fig 1 a doc and don concentrations evidently increased by 0 71 mg l and 0 35 mg l respectively due to 24 h contact with atmosphere it is difficult to estimate the exact contribution of atmospheric dry deposition to dom in real surface water sources based on the results of doc and don presented in fig 1 however considering that usually hydraulic retention time in surface waters such as lake river and reservoir is from a few days to months giraldo and garzón 2002 kawara et al 1998 soares et al 2012 wang et al 2017 much longer than 24 h in this study which may cause more organic matters deposition to surface water therefore atmospheric dry deposition is deduced to contribute dom in surface water to some degree fig 1 b presents that atmospheric dry deposition resulted in the increase of dbp formation to some degree specifically tcm increased by approximately 50 μg l as a result of dry deposition and the value for dcaa and tcaa was 10 15 μg l whereas other dbps were minor according to previous studies zhai et al 2017 zhang et al 2017 tcm doc ratio was in the range of 10 45 μg mg in natural surface water which was less than that from dry deposition pm 53 μg mg evidentially different from the source of dom in natural surface water atmospheric pm originates from mainly combustion of biomass and fossil fuel seinfeld and pankow 2003 huang et al 2014 yao et al 2016 which may explain why higher tcm doc ratio was observed in atmospheric dry deposition pm than nature surface water to sum up dry deposition pm was deduced to be a source of dbps precursors and it is necessary to study the composition and characteristics of organic matters from dry deposition as well as the formation characteristics of dbps 3 2 characteristics of dom fractions derived from atmospheric dry deposition pm 3 2 1 hydrophobicity distribution the dom derived from atmospheric dry deposition pm was fractioned into three fractions hpi tpi and hpo fig 2 shows the doc and the don percentages of each fraction it can be observed that nearly half of doc belonged to hpi and 30 6 of doc was hpo while only 19 7 of doc was tpi which suggests that hpi was the dominant fraction in dry deposition pm this result is consistent with yellow river water hu et al 2014 the relatively high percentage of hpi suggests that the dom derived from atmospheric dry deposition pm mainly originate from anthropogenic sources which is in agreement with the formation of pm yao et al 2016 chang et al 2019 similarly hpi accounted for largest proportion 74 1 of don but the percentage of tpi and hpo were 6 1 and 10 9 respectively suggesting that hpi has higher nitrogen containing organic matters than tpi and hpo fig s2 which may cause higher n dbp formation usually hpi cannot be removed by conventional drinking water treatment processes coagulation sedimentation filtration owing to low octanol water partition coefficient zhao et al 2009 wang et al 2013 therefore the hydrophobicity distribution results indicate that probably a large proportion of dom derived from atmospheric dry deposition pm will react with disinfectants chlorine etc to form dbps during the subsequent disinfection process to further investigate the spectroscopic characteristics of dom derived from pm the results with respect to fluorescence excitation emission matrix eem spectra and suva254 and suva285 are shown in fig 3 and fig s3 respectively fig 3 a shows that the most intense regions were aromatic proteins λex 250 nm λem 380 nm and soluble microbial product smp like regions λex 250 nm λem 380 nm indicating that the fluorescent compounds in pm were mainly aps and smp like compounds which have been regarded as important precursors of hams chu et al 2010 this is different with surface water which mainly exist humic acid and fulvic acid like compounds graeber et al 2012 fig 3 b d show that dom in hpi tpi and hpo also have the most intense peaks at ex em of 250 340 nm in the regions of aps and smp like region and the second highest peak at ex em of 330 440 nm in humic acid like region which indicate that they had similar dom compositions by comparing fig 3 b d it can be gotten that tpi has much higher aps smp like and humic acid like region contents than hpi and hpo suva254 and suva285 commonly represent aromaticity of dom buffle et al 1982 krasner et al 1996 in particular suva285 serves as an indicator of benzene carboxylic acids and phenols buffle et al 1982 krasner et al 1996 fig s3 presents that both suva254 and suva285 values for tpi are greater than hpi and hpo indicating that aromatic dom such as aps benzene carboxylic acids and phenols majorly distributed in tpi which is in agreement with the results of eem spectra the latter two fractions show almost the same suva254 and suva285 values suggesting that their dom had similar aromaticity 3 2 2 mw distribution of different hydrophobicity fractions the dom derived from three different hydrophobicity fractions were further fractioned into four mw groups 1 kda 1 10 kda 10 100 kda and 100 kda fig 4 presents the mw distribution of different hydrophobicity dom fractions and the others shown in fig 4 represents a small portion of the dom lost during the fractionation process including residues on ultrafiltration membranes and ultrafiltration devices for hpi tpi and hpo 1 kda fraction contributed 41 8 25 9 and 34 5 doc respectively which were relatively higher than other fractions with 1 kda dom with 100 kda mw was greater than 10 100 kda fraction in high mw organic matter for hpi tpi and hpo it is noteworthy that dom with 10 kda in hpi and tpi were greater than 50 the results indicate that hpi with low mw fraction 10 kda which is hardly removed by the conventional treatment processes zhao et al 2009 occupied a large proportion of dom in the dry deposition pm this is in agreement with many polluted surface water sources zhao et al 2006 rosario ortiz et al 2007 fig 5 shows the eem spectra for different mw fractions of different hydrophobicity dom derived from atmospheric dry deposition pm as presented in fig 5 a d all the mw fractions of hpi have a most intense peak in smp like λex 250 nm λem 380 nm and aps regions λex 250 nm λem 380 nm moreover the fluorescence intensity increased with the increase of mw suggesting that high mw organic matter in hpi contained more abundant smps and aps compounds than low mw organic matter which is similar with hpo differently tpi with mw 100 kda and 1 kda included more smps and aps compounds than 1 100 kda fig s4 shows suva254 and suva285 of different mw of different hydrophobicity dom fractions derived from pm as for hpi suva254 and suva285 values decreased in the following order 100 kda 10 100 kda 1 kda 1 10 kda suggesting that high mw organic matter 10 kda contained more aromatic structures and humic compounds than low mw organic matter 10 kda which is the same with the results of eem suva254 and suva285 values for 10 kda fraction in tpi were higher than that of 10 kda suva254 and suva285 values apart from 10 100 kda fraction were basically the same for the other fractions in hpo indicating that aromatic structure in tpi and hpo fractions mainly occurred at low and high mw organic matters respectively 3 2 3 the relationship of cx3r type dbp fp and suva a previous study has demonstrated that suva254 can be used to predict dbp fp hua et al 2015 fig s5 presents the correlation of suva254 and suva285 as well as thms haas hals hans hams and hnms for the different dom fractions derived from pm after chlor am ination suva254 and suva285 have similar results which indicated that suva285 can also be used to predict dbp fp and the following discussion is performed with suva254 as illustrated in fig s5 a and b thms shows the strongest correlation r 2 0 90 and 0 71 for chlorination and chloramination respectively with suva254 indicating uv absorbing compounds are the primary precursors to form thms hams also showed a good correlation with suva254 r 2 0 70 during chlorination this indicates that uv absorbing compounds and aromatic carbon containing nitrogen within dom derived from pm are the primary sources of precursors for hams however the correlation of hams and suva254 became weak r 2 0 42 during chloramination which is mainly due to a new source of nitrogen from nh2cl a generally weak correlation r 2 0 28 0 33 and 0 24 was observed between suva254 and hals hans and hnms during chlorination and haas has a poor correlation with suva254 which indicated that non humic substances can contribute a large number of cx3r type dbps for chloramination a similar result was shown for hals hans and hnms while a weak correlation occurred between haas and suva254 r 2 0 47 which may be due to different formation mechanism 3 3 c dbp fp characteristics during chlor am ination 3 3 1 thms in order to avoid concentration effects the dbp fp was normalized by doc fig 6 and fig s6 show the results of three c dbp fps of different dom fractions derived from dry deposition pm after chlor am ination the previous study has demonstrated that the concentrations of c dbps in finished drinking water were thms haas hals for both chlorination and chloramination goslan et al 2009 which is consistent with the results from most dom fractions in this study this indicates that the composition of the precursors of c dbps might be similar in the atmospheric dry deposition pm and drinking water source by comparing fig 6 a and b higher total thm fp was observed for most dom fractions during chlorination than chloramination indicating that chloramination generally resulted in less thms which is in agreement with the results from natural water disinfection hua and reckhow 2007 bougeard et al 2010 it might be explained by that chlorine has higher oxidative ability than chloramine during chlorination thm fp was generated by tpi especially 10 kda tpi which is obvious more than other fractions during chloramination more thm fp was also observed in tpi this indicated that tpi was main precursors for generating thm fp during chlor am iantion in addition fig s6 a and b shows that tcm fp was greater than dcm fp in all dom fractions during chlorination while the results were opposite during chloramination dcm fp tcm fp which is consistent with a previous research using surface water yang et al 2014 this could be because the oxidizing power of nh2cl is weaker than cl2 and it is impossible to further transform dcm to tcm 3 3 2 haas fig 6 c 6 d s6 c and s6 d display the haa fp of each dom fraction derived from pm as shown in fig 6 c and d similar to thms total haas were greater during chlorination than that during chloramination in most fractions in addition haas mainly formed by 1 100 kda hpo during chlorination which is almost an order of magnitude higher than other fractions during chloramination the majority of haas was generated by tpi as presented in fig s6 c and d tcaa was the most main haas species during chlorination nevertheless the formed dcaa was more than tcaa for most fractions during chloramination which is similar with the results of a previous study goslan et al 2009 this could be because the oxidizing capacity of nh2cl is weaker than cl2 and it is impossible to further transform dcaa to tcaa 3 3 3 hals the hal fp for different dom fractions derived from pm is shown in fig 6 e 6 f s6 e and s6 f similarly total hals were greater during chlorination than that during chloramination in most fractions as illustrated in fig 6 e and f more hal fp was seen in hpo during chlorination while hpo did not form hals during chloramination as shown in fig s6 e and f ch fp was higher than dcal fp during chlorination in addition hals was detectable only in hpi during chloramination and dcal was main species while ch was not detected as a result of below the detection limit 3 4 n dbp fp characteristics during chlor am ination 3 4 1 hans fig 7 and fig s7 show the n dbp fps of different dom fractions derived from pm after chlor am ination han fp of each dom fraction after chlor am ination is shown in fig 7 a and 7 b s7 a and s7 b as shown in fig 7 a and b total hans were greater during chlorination than that during chloramination in most fractions in addition as seen in fig s7 a tpi was main precursors of hans during chlorination and dcan was main hans while no hans were detected in tpi during chloramination as shown in fig s7 a and b dcan was dominant hans species in most fractions irrespectively of chlorination or chloramination further hans was only detected in hpi with 1 kda fraction during chlorination but hans was also produced by other hpi fractions during chloramination indicating nh2cl is also an important source of nitrogen in n dbps which was consistent with a previous study yang et al 2010 shah and mitch 2012 chu et al 2016 in addition hpi with highest don doc did not exhibited higher han fp fig s2 which may be related to the structure of the organic matter and the formation path of hans 3 4 2 hams ham fp formed during chlor am ination of different dom derived from pm is illustrated in fig 7 c and 7 d s7 c and s7 d as shown in fig 7 c and d more ham fp was observed in tpi during chlorination while more ham fp was observed in hpi during chloramination as shown in fig s7 c and d both dcam and tcam were detectable during chlor am ination of most fractions and dcam fp was much higher than tcam fp in all fractions regardless of chlorination or chloramination 3 4 3 hnms the results of hnm fp formed by different dom fractions derived from pm after chlor am ination are displayed in fig 7 e 7 f s7 e and s7 f as shown in fig 7 e and 7 f hnms were only detected in few fractions during chlor am ination overall chloramination formed more hnms than chlorination which is disagreement with previous studies bougeard et al 2010 hu et al 2010 probably because there is a new formation path due to different dom nature further 1 kda tpi was major precursors of hnms during chlorination while 1 kda hpo was major precursors of hnms during chloramination in summary the dom derived from pm can form hans hams and hnms during chlor am ination among of which hams were the most followed by hans and hnms which is in disagreement in finished water in real drinking water plants in which hans were the most n dbps richardson et al 2007 bond et al 2011 2015 chu et al 2011 3 5 integrated toxic risk of selected cx3r type dbps in the past plewa and his colleagues systematically investigated the cytotoxicity and genotoxicity of a range of halogenated dbps plewa et al 2004 2008b muellner et al 2007 the integrated toxic risk values itrv were calculated to evaluate the comprehensive risk of dbps based on cytotoxicity and genotoxicity fig 8 shows itrv of eight cx3r type dbps tcm dcaa tcaa dcan tcan dcam dcam and tcnm after chlor am ination of dom fractions derived from dry deposition pm and surface raw water zhang et al 2017 to compare the overall toxicity based on same organic matters level the itrv are the reciprocal of the averaged c½ cytotoxicity and the scge genotoxic potency genotoxicity values which were calculated using equation 1 1 i t r v x 1 n 1 c 1 2 x g e n o t o x i c i t y p o t e n c y x m c x where c1 2x and genotoxic potencyx are cyto and geno toxicity of each dbp compound m is the relative molecular mass of each dbp compound cx is the fp of each dbp compound nm x is the specific dbp compound as is shown in fig 8 a and b dbps formed during chlorination and chloramination have similar itrv and the main contributors of itrv are tpi and hpo for chlorination and chloramination respectively in addition the itrv of tcm was obviously higher than that of other cx3r type dbps during chlorination for chloramination tcnm was the major contributor to itrv as is shown in fig 8 c the itrv of pm solution is higher than that of raw water during chlorination much more tcm and tcaa were formed in pm solutions than in raw water during chlorination all the cx3r type dbps but tcan were observed to be higher in pm solution than in raw water signifying that the organic matters in dry deposition pm will promote the formation of cx3r type dbps in raw water in summary the increase in the formation of dbps derived from dry deposition pm to surface raw water are noteworthy 4 conclusion the main conclusions were as follows 1 atmospheric dry deposition pm was deduced to contribute dom and be a source of dbps precursors in surface water especially tcm dcaa and tcaa therefore the increase in the formation of dbps derived from dry deposition pm to surface raw water are noteworthy 2 among dry deposition pm hpi contributed the most dom and low mw dom was the main component of hpi fluorescent compounds in pm were mainly aps and smp like compounds and tpi contained more abundant smps and aps compounds than hpi and hpo 3 among c dbps thms concentrations were much higher than haas and hals formed during chlor am ination more thms haas and hals were formed during chlorination than chloraminationm it is noteworthy that the main precursor of haas formed during chlorination was 1 100 kda hpo the n dbp formation during chlor am ination was in the following order hams hans hnms only small mw dom 1 kda was the precursor of the formation of hnms during chlor am inaiton 4 dbps formed during chlorination and chloramination has similar comprehensive toxicity and the main contributors of integrated toxicity are tpi and hpo for chlorination and chloramination respectively the toxicity of tcm formed during chlorination was obviously higher than other cx3r type dbps for chloramination tcnm was the major contributor to comprehensive toxicity

18176,disinfection by products dbps precursors can be regarded mainly from the drinking water sources and the water treatment processes a recent study showed that dissolved organic matter dom in atmosphere is an important precursor source of dbps through atmospheric wet deposition however little information is available on the characteristics of dom derived from dry deposition particulate matter pm and the impact of dry deposition on cx3r type dbp formation this study determined whether dry deposition directly contributed the production of dbps during chlor am ination and investigated the mechanism behind the contribution based on the combination of the resin and membrane for fractionating dom fractions the results showed that the hydrophilic fraction hpi contributed the most dom and low molecular weight dom 10 kda was the main component of hpi in addition aromatic proteins and soluble microbial products like compounds were the dominant fluorescent species in dom derived from pm and 10 kda transphilic was the most abundant the concentrations of c dbps and n dbps in disinfected pm solution were trihalomethanes thms haloacetic acids haas haloaldehydes and haloacetamides haloacetonitriles halonitromethanes for both chlorination and chloramination the main contributors of calculated toxicity are transphilic and hydrophobic in chlorination and chloramination respectively dry deposition pm was deduced to contribute dom and dbp formation after chlorination in surface water especially thms and haas these results presented herein provide key information for

han and zhang 2018 trihalomethanes thms and haloacetic acids haas as carbonaceous dbps c dbps are frequently detected in finished water and are strictly limited in regulatory guidelines by us

toxicity than c dbps e g thms muellner et al 2007 plewa et al 2008a 2008b wagner and plewa 2017 these six classes of dbps mentioned earlier can be classified as cx3r type x h cl br or i dbps due to their similar molecular structure which have been extensively studied in previous studies for their high detection rates concentrations and toxicities in finished water richardson et al 2007 chu et al 2012 zhang et al 2017 atmospheric deposition plays an important role in carbon cycle fowler et al 2009 kuang et al 2016 recently many studies found that the organic matters derived from atmosphere will increase concentrations of dom in surface water sources through precipitation gao et al 2018 warner and saros 2019 xing et al 2019 however dry deposition especially particulate matters pm deposition as another way transporting atmospheric organic matters to the surface water sources may have important implications for the contribution of dom in water sources according to a previous study jacobson et al 2000 pm contained abundant organic matters for instance ti et al 2018 found that the contribution of atmospheric dry deposition to the total don of taihu lake was 1 4 indicating that dry deposition especially pm deposition can be an important source of dom in surface water sources therefore there is a contact opportunity for dom in pm and disinfectants during disinfection process for wet deposition precipitation only one study examined the contribution of atmospheric dom from wet deposition to the formation of dbps hou et al 2018 however till now little has been known about the effect of atmospheric pm from dry deposition on the formation and the toxicity of dbps which is necessary to be estimated considering that dry deposition is also an important pathway transporting atmospheric dom to drinking water sources dom is a complex organic mixture with a broad spectrum of molecular weights functional groups distributions it is vital to isolate the dom into more homogeneous groups based on different chemical or physical properties such as size structure and functionality to better understand the formation mechanism of dbps and finally achieve good control effect among various isolation methods resin fractionation and membrane filtration are the most commonly adopted methods chen et al 2014 han et al 2015 pan et al 2016 an et al 2017 zhang et al 2018 in the past resin fractionation and membrane filtration were used respectively for obtaining the hydrophobicity and molecular weight mw distribution of dom in drinking water sources however no information is available concerning the combination of resin fractionation and membrane filtration to further fractionate dom it is possible to get more detailed information concerning characteristics of dom and dbps precursors due to further refine the dom based on hydrophobicity and mw this study attempted to apply the combination of resin fractionation and membrane filtration to fractionate dom from atmosphere pm for the first time this novelty in this study can be seen clearly and detailly in fig s1 supporting information the objectives of this study were to 1 determine the contribution of atmospheric dry deposition on dom and the production of dbps during chlor am ination in surface water 2 investigate the characteristics of dom fractions from atmospheric dry deposition pm 3 assess the formation potential fp of cx3r type dbps thms haas hals hans hnms and hams formed from atmospheric dry deposition dom 4 evaluate the integrated risk of these cx3r type dbps and the contribution of dry deposition pm to the dbps toxicity the results presented herein would provide key information for dwtps to control dbps from the perspectives of atmospheric dry deposition especially in the case of heavy air pollution 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemicals and materials cx3r type dbps standard solutions including thms haas hals hans hnms and hams were purchased from supelco st louis missouri usa xad 4 and xad 8 resins were purchased from sigma aldrich a set of stirred millipore ultra filtration cells model 8400 and ultra filtration membranes with molecular size cut offs at 100 kda 10 kda and 1 kda were obtained from usa millipore potassium dihydrogen phosphate kh2po4 and dipotassium hydrogen phosphate k2hpo4 were supplied by sigma aldrich usa sodium hypochlorite naocl and nitric acid hno3 were obtained from sinopharm chemical reagent co shanghai china methyl tert butyl ether was purchased from aladdin industrial inc shanghai china other information is available in supplementary material all other chemicals were obtained from sinopharm chemical reagent co ltd shanghai china and were of analytical grade unless otherwise noted 2 2 experimental procedures 2 2 1 natural dry deposition in order to determine the contribution of atmospheric dry deposition on dom in surface water sources and dbp formation during disinfection a natural dry deposition experiment was carried out three sampling basins filled with 2 l of fresh ultrapure water as parallel samples were placed at the roof of the mingjing building shanghai for 24 h to naturally collect the atmospheric dry deposition afterwards the water with atmospheric dom was stirred by a magnetic stirrer with a speed of 150 r min to ensure a complete mixing state and then filtered through 0 45 μm glass fiber filters for water parameters analysis as well as the subsequent disinfection experiment which can be found in section 2 2 3 2 2 2 dom fractionation in order to quickly collect more pm for subsequent research resin and membrane fractionation three total pm samplers zr 3920c junray qingdao were mounted on the roof of the mingjing building in the campus of tongji university yangpu shanghai china and to collect pm total pm derived dom solutions were prepared as follows total pm were collected on the quartz microfiber filters with pore diameter of 1 6 μm 1851 090 whatman england and the total mass of pm was approximately 78 mg three filters were rinsed using ultrapure water for three times respectively and then all the solutions containing isolated particles were transferred into the corresponding beakers and finally additional ultrapure water was further added into the beaker until its solution volume reached 1 l solution was then stirred by a magnetic stirrer with a speed of 150 r min to ensure a complete mixing state the mixing process proceeded for 24 h to guarantee sufficient dissolution of pm derived dom then total pm derived dom solutions were filtered through 0 45 μm glass fiber filters finally 3 l pm derived dom solutions were concentrated to 1 l by a reverse osmosis unit which can contain the majority of dom zhao et al 2006 pressman et al 2012 concentrated dom solution was stored in the dark at 4 c until use the storage time of all solutions was no longer than 7 days characteristics of concentrated dom solutions derived from pm are presented in table s1 a portion of concentrated dom solutions derived from pm was acidified to ph 2 using sulfuric acid and then passed through xad 8 resin followed by xad 4 resin the effluent from the xad 4 resin was referred to as the hydrophilic fraction hpi the fraction adsorbed by xad 8 resin and subsequently back eluted from the resin column using sodium hydroxide solution with ph 11 was referred to as the hydrophobic fraction hpo the xad 4 resin retained organic compounds comprising the transphilic fraction tpi and were also eluted using the same sodium hydroxide solution in the reverse direction the ph of the three fractions was adjusted to 7 using sulfuric acid or sodium hydroxide and the volume of all fractions was adjusted to the initial sample volume using ultrapure water the detailed hydrophobicity fractionation procedure can be found in previous studies hua and reckhow 2007 chu et al 2010 han et al 2015 then the water samples with different hydrophilicities were fractionated using a 400 ml stirred cell millipore us with millipore ultrafiltration membranes amicon billerica ma with mw cut offs of 100 kda 10 kda and 1 kda respectively usually the threshold value between high and low mw organic matter is 10 kda liu et al 2012 1 kda and 100 kda of dom represent even lower and higher mw organic matter the detailed mw fractionation procedure can be found in previous studies hua and reckhow 2007 chu et al 2014 han et al 2015 finally dbp fp tests were carried out for the separated twelve fractions and the details can be found in section 2 2 3 2 2 3 dbp fp tests dbp fp tests were performed in 40 ml amber glass volumetric bottles under headspace free conditions in the dark at a temperature controlled 25 0 0 5 c room based on the procedure reported in previous studies krasner et al 2004 zhang et al 2017 the disinfectant dosages for dbp fp tests were chlorine cl2 3 doc mg l 7 6 nh3 n mg l 10 mg l the fresh monochloramine nh2cl solutions were prepared in advance following the procedures of mitch mitch and sedlak 2002 and nh2cl dosage 3 doc mg l 2 3 analytical methods some general parameters such as uv vis dissolved organic carbon doc don and specific ultraviolet absorbance suva can be used to predict the amount and characterization of dom hua et al 2015 uv absorbance at 254 nm suva254 and 285 nm suva285 were measured using a uv vis spectrophotometer uv 9000s metash instrument shanghai to characterize the aromaticity of dom which were calculated by dividing the uv absorbance at 254 nm and 285 nm by solution doc respectively three dimensional spectrofluorometry f 7100 fluorescence hitachi japan has been widely used to characterize different functional groups and sources of dom han et al 2015 li et al 2020 fluorescence scans λex 200 450 nm λem 220 550 nm was performed with 5 nm slits for excitation and emission doc and total dissolved nitrogen tdn were measured using a toc analyzer shimadzu toc vcph japan the detection limits of doc and tdn were 0 1 mg l concentrations of different dissolved inorganic nitrogen din species i e nh3 n no3 and no2 were measured using their respective hach test kits with a uv vis spectrophotometer hach dr6000 the detection limits of nh3 n no3 and no2 were 0 02 mg l 0 002 mg l and 0 1 mg l respectively don is the difference between tdn and din thms including dichloromethane dcm trichloromethane tcm hans including dichloroacetonitrile dcan and trichloroacetonitrile tcan hnms including dichloronitromethane dcnm and trichloronitromethane tcnm hams including dichloroacetamide dcam trichloroacetamide tcam and hals including dichloroacetaldehyde dcal and trichloroacetaldehyde ch were detected using gas chromatography electron capture detection gc ecd qp2010plus shimadzu corporation japan haas including chloroacetic acid dichloroacetic acid dcaa and trichloroacetic acid tcaa were measured with a gas chromatography mass spectrometer gc ms qp2020 shimadzu corporation japan detailed information on the analytical methods of these cx3r type dbps were presented elsewhere hou et al 2018 zhang et al 2019a 2019b 3 results and discussion 3 1 dbp formation from natural dry deposition the results of dbp formation during the disinfection of ultra pure water with and without atmospheric dry deposition dom are shown in fig 1 as is shown in fig 1 a doc and don concentrations evidently increased by 0 71 mg l and 0 35 mg l respectively due to 24 h contact with atmosphere it is difficult to estimate the exact contribution of atmospheric dry deposition to dom in real surface water sources based on the results of doc and don presented in fig 1 however considering that usually hydraulic retention time in surface waters such as lake river and reservoir is from a few days to months giraldo and garzón 2002 kawara et al 1998 soares et al 2012 wang et al 2017 much longer than 24 h in this study which may cause more organic matters deposition to surface water therefore atmospheric dry deposition is deduced to contribute dom in surface water to some degree fig 1 b presents that atmospheric dry deposition resulted in the increase of dbp formation to some degree specifically tcm increased by approximately 50 μg l as a result of dry deposition and the value for dcaa and tcaa was 10 15 μg l whereas other dbps were minor according to previous studies zhai et al 2017 zhang et al 2017 tcm doc ratio was in the range of 10 45 μg mg in natural surface water which was less than that from dry deposition pm 53 μg mg evidentially different from the source of dom in natural surface water atmospheric pm originates from mainly combustion of biomass and fossil fuel seinfeld and pankow 2003 huang et al 2014 yao et al 2016 which may explain why higher tcm doc ratio was observed in atmospheric dry deposition pm than nature surface water to sum up dry deposition pm was deduced to be a source of dbps precursors and it is necessary to study the composition and characteristics of organic matters from dry deposition as well as the formation characteristics of dbps 3 2 characteristics of dom fractions derived from atmospheric dry deposition pm 3 2 1 hydrophobicity distribution the dom derived from atmospheric dry deposition pm was fractioned into three fractions hpi tpi and hpo fig 2 shows the doc and the don percentages of each fraction it can be observed that nearly half of doc belonged to hpi and 30 6 of doc was hpo while only 19 7 of doc was tpi which suggests that hpi was the dominant fraction in dry deposition pm this result is consistent with yellow river water hu et al 2014 the relatively high percentage of hpi suggests that the dom derived from atmospheric dry deposition pm mainly originate from anthropogenic sources which is in agreement with the formation of pm yao et al 2016 chang et al 2019 similarly hpi accounted for largest proportion 74 1 of don but the percentage of tpi and hpo were 6 1 and 10 9 respectively suggesting that hpi has higher nitrogen containing organic matters than tpi and hpo fig s2 which may cause higher n dbp formation usually hpi cannot be removed by conventional drinking water treatment processes coagulation sedimentation filtration owing to low octanol water partition coefficient zhao et al 2009 wang et al 2013 therefore the hydrophobicity distribution results indicate that probably a large proportion of dom derived from atmospheric dry deposition pm will react with disinfectants chlorine etc to form dbps during the subsequent disinfection process to further investigate the spectroscopic characteristics of dom derived from pm the results with respect to fluorescence excitation emission matrix eem spectra and suva254 and suva285 are shown in fig 3 and fig s3 respectively fig 3 a shows that the most intense regions were aromatic proteins λex 250 nm λem 380 nm and soluble microbial product smp like regions λex 250 nm λem 380 nm indicating that the fluorescent compounds in pm were mainly aps and smp like compounds which have been regarded as important precursors of hams chu et al 2010 this is different with surface water which mainly exist humic acid and fulvic acid like compounds graeber et al 2012 fig 3 b d show that dom in hpi tpi and hpo also have the most intense peaks at ex em of 250 340 nm in the regions of aps and smp like region and the second highest peak at ex em of 330 440 nm in humic acid like region which indicate that they had similar dom compositions by comparing fig 3 b d it can be gotten that tpi has much higher aps smp like and humic acid like region contents than hpi and hpo suva254 and suva285 commonly represent aromaticity of dom buffle et al 1982 krasner et al 1996 in particular suva285 serves as an indicator of benzene carboxylic acids and phenols buffle et al 1982 krasner et al 1996 fig s3 presents that both suva254 and suva285 values for tpi are greater than hpi and hpo indicating that aromatic dom such as aps benzene carboxylic acids and phenols majorly distributed in tpi which is in agreement with the results of eem spectra the latter two fractions show almost the same suva254 and suva285 values suggesting that their dom had similar aromaticity 3 2 2 mw distribution of different hydrophobicity fractions the dom derived from three different hydrophobicity fractions were further fractioned into four mw groups 1 kda 1 10 kda 10 100 kda and 100 kda fig 4 presents the mw distribution of different hydrophobicity dom fractions and the others shown in fig 4 represents a small portion of the dom lost during the fractionation process including residues on ultrafiltration membranes and ultrafiltration devices for hpi tpi and hpo 1 kda fraction contributed 41 8 25 9 and 34 5 doc respectively which were relatively higher than other fractions with 1 kda dom with 100 kda mw was greater than 10 100 kda fraction in high mw organic matter for hpi tpi and hpo it is noteworthy that dom with 10 kda in hpi and tpi were greater than 50 the results indicate that hpi with low mw fraction 10 kda which is hardly removed by the conventional treatment processes zhao et al 2009 occupied a large proportion of dom in the dry deposition pm this is in agreement with many polluted surface water sources zhao et al 2006 rosario ortiz et al 2007 fig 5 shows the eem spectra for different mw fractions of different hydrophobicity dom derived from atmospheric dry deposition pm as presented in fig 5 a d all the mw fractions of hpi have a most intense peak in smp like λex 250 nm λem 380 nm and aps regions λex 250 nm λem 380 nm moreover the fluorescence intensity increased with the increase of mw suggesting that high mw organic matter in hpi contained more abundant smps and aps compounds than low mw organic matter which is similar with hpo differently tpi with mw 100 kda and 1 kda included more smps and aps compounds than 1 100 kda fig s4 shows suva254 and suva285 of different mw of different hydrophobicity dom fractions derived from pm as for hpi suva254 and suva285 values decreased in the following order 100 kda 10 100 kda 1 kda 1 10 kda suggesting that high mw organic matter 10 kda contained more aromatic structures and humic compounds than low mw organic matter 10 kda which is the same with the results of eem suva254 and suva285 values for 10 kda fraction in tpi were higher than that of 10 kda suva254 and suva285 values apart from 10 100 kda fraction were basically the same for the other fractions in hpo indicating that aromatic structure in tpi and hpo fractions mainly occurred at low and high mw organic matters respectively 3 2 3 the relationship of cx3r type dbp fp and suva a previous study has demonstrated that suva254 can be used to predict dbp fp hua et al 2015 fig s5 presents the correlation of suva254 and suva285 as well as thms haas hals hans hams and hnms for the different dom fractions derived from pm after chlor am ination suva254 and suva285 have similar results which indicated that suva285 can also be used to predict dbp fp and the following discussion is performed with suva254 as illustrated in fig s5 a and b thms shows the strongest correlation r 2 0 90 and 0 71 for chlorination and chloramination respectively with suva254 indicating uv absorbing compounds are the primary precursors to form thms hams also showed a good correlation with suva254 r 2 0 70 during chlorination this indicates that uv absorbing compounds and aromatic carbon containing nitrogen within dom derived from pm are the primary sources of precursors for hams however the correlation of hams and suva254 became weak r 2 0 42 during chloramination which is mainly due to a new source of nitrogen from nh2cl a generally weak correlation r 2 0 28 0 33 and 0 24 was observed between suva254 and hals hans and hnms during chlorination and haas has a poor correlation with suva254 which indicated that non humic substances can contribute a large number of cx3r type dbps for chloramination a similar result was shown for hals hans and hnms while a weak correlation occurred between haas and suva254 r 2 0 47 which may be due to different formation mechanism 3 3 c dbp fp characteristics during chlor am ination 3 3 1 thms in order to avoid concentration effects the dbp fp was normalized by doc fig 6 and fig s6 show the results of three c dbp fps of different dom fractions derived from dry deposition pm after chlor am ination the previous study has demonstrated that the concentrations of c dbps in finished drinking water were thms haas hals for both chlorination and chloramination goslan et al 2009 which is consistent with the results from most dom fractions in this study this indicates that the composition of the precursors of c dbps might be similar in the atmospheric dry deposition pm and drinking water source by comparing fig 6 a and b higher total thm fp was observed for most dom fractions during chlorination than chloramination indicating that chloramination generally resulted in less thms which is in agreement with the results from natural water disinfection hua and reckhow 2007 bougeard et al 2010 it might be explained by that chlorine has higher oxidative ability than chloramine during chlorination thm fp was generated by tpi especially 10 kda tpi which is obvious more than other fractions during chloramination more thm fp was also observed in tpi this indicated that tpi was main precursors for generating thm fp during chlor am iantion in addition fig s6 a and b shows that tcm fp was greater than dcm fp in all dom fractions during chlorination while the results were opposite during chloramination dcm fp tcm fp which is consistent with a previous research using surface water yang et al 2014 this could be because the oxidizing power of nh2cl is weaker than cl2 and it is impossible to further transform dcm to tcm 3 3 2 haas fig 6 c 6 d s6 c and s6 d display the haa fp of each dom fraction derived from pm as shown in fig 6 c and d similar to thms total haas were greater during chlorination than that during chloramination in most fractions in addition haas mainly formed by 1 100 kda hpo during chlorination which is almost an order of magnitude higher than other fractions during chloramination the majority of haas was generated by tpi as presented in fig s6 c and d tcaa was the most main haas species during chlorination nevertheless the formed dcaa was more than tcaa for most fractions during chloramination which is similar with the results of a previous study goslan et al 2009 this could be because the oxidizing capacity of nh2cl is weaker than cl2 and it is impossible to further transform dcaa to tcaa 3 3 3 hals the hal fp for different dom fractions derived from pm is shown in fig 6 e 6 f s6 e and s6 f similarly total hals were greater during chlorination than that during chloramination in most fractions as illustrated in fig 6 e and f more hal fp was seen in hpo during chlorination while hpo did not form hals during chloramination as shown in fig s6 e and f ch fp was higher than dcal fp during chlorination in addition hals was detectable only in hpi during chloramination and dcal was main species while ch was not detected as a result of below the detection limit 3 4 n dbp fp characteristics during chlor am ination 3 4 1 hans fig 7 and fig s7 show the n dbp fps of different dom fractions derived from pm after chlor am ination han fp of each dom fraction after chlor am ination is shown in fig 7 a and 7 b s7 a and s7 b as shown in fig 7 a and b total hans were greater during chlorination than that during chloramination in most fractions in addition as seen in fig s7 a tpi was main precursors of hans during chlorination and dcan was main hans while no hans were detected in tpi during chloramination as shown in fig s7 a and b dcan was dominant hans species in most fractions irrespectively of chlorination or chloramination further hans was only detected in hpi with 1 kda fraction during chlorination but hans was also produced by other hpi fractions during chloramination indicating nh2cl is also an important source of nitrogen in n dbps which was consistent with a previous study yang et al 2010 shah and mitch 2012 chu et al 2016 in addition hpi with highest don doc did not exhibited higher han fp fig s2 which may be related to the structure of the organic matter and the formation path of hans 3 4 2 hams ham fp formed during chlor am ination of different dom derived from pm is illustrated in fig 7 c and 7 d s7 c and s7 d as shown in fig 7 c and d more ham fp was observed in tpi during chlorination while more ham fp was observed in hpi during chloramination as shown in fig s7 c and d both dcam and tcam were detectable during chlor am ination of most fractions and dcam fp was much higher than tcam fp in all fractions regardless of chlorination or chloramination 3 4 3 hnms the results of hnm fp formed by different dom fractions derived from pm after chlor am ination are displayed in fig 7 e 7 f s7 e and s7 f as shown in fig 7 e and 7 f hnms were only detected in few fractions during chlor am ination overall chloramination formed more hnms than chlorination which is disagreement with previous studies bougeard et al 2010 hu et al 2010 probably because there is a new formation path due to different dom nature further 1 kda tpi was major precursors of hnms during chlorination while 1 kda hpo was major precursors of hnms during chloramination in summary the dom derived from pm can form hans hams and hnms during chlor am ination among of which hams were the most followed by hans and hnms which is in disagreement in finished water in real drinking water plants in which hans were the most n dbps richardson et al 2007 bond et al 2011 2015 chu et al 2011 3 5 integrated toxic risk of selected cx3r type dbps in the past plewa and his colleagues systematically investigated the cytotoxicity and genotoxicity of a range of halogenated dbps plewa et al 2004 2008b muellner et al 2007 the integrated toxic risk values itrv were calculated to evaluate the comprehensive risk of dbps based on cytotoxicity and genotoxicity fig 8 shows itrv of eight cx3r type dbps tcm dcaa tcaa dcan tcan dcam dcam and tcnm after chlor am ination of dom fractions derived from dry deposition pm and surface raw water zhang et al 2017 to compare the overall toxicity based on same organic matters level the itrv are the reciprocal of the averaged c½ cytotoxicity and the scge genotoxic potency genotoxicity values which were calculated using equation 1 1 i t r v x 1 n 1 c 1 2 x g e n o t o x i c i t y p o t e n c y x m c x where c1 2x and genotoxic potencyx are cyto and geno toxicity of each dbp compound m is the relative molecular mass of each dbp compound cx is the fp of each dbp compound nm x is the specific dbp compound as is shown in fig 8 a and b dbps formed during chlorination and chloramination have similar itrv and the main contributors of itrv are tpi and hpo for chlorination and chloramination respectively in addition the itrv of tcm was obviously higher than that of other cx3r type dbps during chlorination for chloramination tcnm was the major contributor to itrv as is shown in fig 8 c the itrv of pm solution is higher than that of raw water during chlorination much more tcm and tcaa were formed in pm solutions than in raw water during chlorination all the cx3r type dbps but tcan were observed to be higher in pm solution than in raw water signifying that the organic matters in dry deposition pm will promote the formation of cx3r type dbps in raw water in summary the increase in the formation of dbps derived from dry deposition pm to surface raw water are noteworthy 4 conclusion the main conclusions were as follows 1 atmospheric dry deposition pm was deduced to contribute dom and be a source of dbps precursors in surface water especially tcm dcaa and tcaa therefore the increase in the formation of dbps derived from dry deposition pm to surface raw water are noteworthy 2 among dry deposition pm hpi contributed the most dom and low mw dom was the main component of hpi fluorescent compounds in pm were mainly aps and smp like compounds and tpi contained more abundant smps and aps compounds than hpi and hpo 3 among c dbps thms concentrations were much higher than haas and hals formed during chlor am ination more thms haas and hals were formed during chlorination than chloraminationm it is noteworthy that the main precursor of haas formed during chlorination was 1 100 kda hpo the n dbp formation during chlor am ination was in the following order hams hans hnms only small mw dom 1 kda was the precursor of the formation of hnms during chlor am inaiton 4 dbps formed during chlorination and chloramination has similar comprehensive toxicity and the main contributors of integrated toxicity are tpi and hpo for chlorination and chloramination respectively the toxicity of tcm formed during chlorination was obviously higher than other cx3r type dbps for chloramination tcnm was the major contributor to comprehensive toxicity

18177,despite the advantage of model based design anaerobic digesters are seldom designed using biokinetic models due to lack of reliable kinetic coefficients and or systematic approaches for incorporating kinetic models into digester design this study presents a systematic framework which couples practical identifiability uncertainty quantification and attainable region ar concepts for defining process performance targets especially when reliable kinetic coefficients are unavailable within the framework we introduce the concept of self optimizing ars which define performance targets that results in near optimal operation in spite of variations in kinetic coefficients using the case of modified hill model only 3 out of the 6 model parameters unidentifiable set are responsible for the model prediction uncertainty the uncertainty bands mean 10th percentile and 90th percentile on the model states has been computed using the monte carlo simulation procedure and attainable regions for the different levels of uncertainty has been constructed and the boundaries interpreted into digester structures the self optimizing attainable regions have been defined as the intersection region of the attainable regions corresponding to the mean 10th percentile and 90th percentile incorporating uncertainty significantly reduces performance targets of the process but increases self optimality in defining performance targets unlike the attainable region which represents the limits of achievability for defined kinetics the self optimizing attainable region represents the set of all possible states attainable by the system even in cases of kinetic uncertainty in summary the concept of self optimizing ars provides a systematic way of defining process performance targets and making economic decisions under conditions of uncertainty graphical abstract graphical abstract showing the self optimizing attainable region image 1 keywords self optimizing attainable regions practical identifiability uncertainty quantification anaerobic digester synthesis 1 introduction anaerobic digestion ad of animal manure is of great importance to the waste treatment and bioenergy industries since the biomethane produced is a promising renewable energy alternative to fossil fuels the modelling of anaerobic treatment process is a mature research area now with a strong shift from model development towards application development aimed at solving various design and operational challenges various models have been constructed to describe the anaerobic treatment process and the key motivations for model development have mainly been operational analysis technology development as well as digester design batstone 2006 the model based design is particularly important as the capital cost for anaerobic digesters determined from design is a key motivation for implementers the kinetics captured by ad models is highly important for an optimal digester design since operating conditions volumetric gas production process stability finn et al 2013 yu et al 2013 batstone 2006 kythreotou et al 2014 as well as effluent quality can be predicted kythreotou et al 2014 yu et al 2013 despite the advantage of model based design anaerobic digesters are seldom designed using biokinetic models but rather based on a combination of hydraulic and organic loading where the digester capacity is determined for a given loading rate temperature regime mixing etc wang et al 2007 this is because the use of biokinetic models is highly dependent upon availability of kinetic coefficients batstone 2006 wang et al 2007 but it is often difficult to get reliable kinetic parameters in practical operation which results in kinetic uncertainty and hence uncertain process performance if the models are used for digester design summarily three main challenges can be mentioned with the use of models to design anaerobic digesters 1 lack of systematic approaches for incorporating process kinetics in digester design 2 the reliability of some of the studies using kinetic models to guide design of anaerobic digesters is undermined by uncertainty existing in the in kinetic coefficients 3 existing model based studies are limited to single stage digesters and operating the process as a single stage generally limits overall performance this is supported by the fact that ad involves multiple bioreactions steps each step catalyzed by a specific group of microorganisms and when operated as a single stage it limits the possible combination of pathways since the process conditions are only suitable for all microorganisms with no reaction being optimized epa 2006 however most of the modeling studies on ad have focused on the model development approach techniques for parameter estimation with less effort devoted to assessing model reliability identifiability and uncertainty or how to incorporate uncertainty in digester design and operation a systematic approach for handling kinetic uncertainty in design of anaerobic digesters with focus on multi stage anaerobic digesters networks as opposed to single stage systems will be a breakthrough in advancing model based optimization of anaerobic digestion this study is therefore designed to develop a systematic model based framework fig 1 for performance targeting and synthesis of anaerobic digester networks when reliable kinetic models are not available the framework fig 1 is realized in two phases which may involve feedback checks at specific steps depending on the system performance after every step in the first phase model reliability assessment one selects a kinetic model appropriate for a digested substrate of interest e g solid waste sludge wastewater etc assesses the model s reliability and quantifies the model prediction uncertainty resulting from kinetic uncertainty in the second phase self optimizing design one mainly defines the robust performance targets of the system considering the uncertainty bounds computed in phase 1 phase 2 is based on the concept of attainable regions which is a geometric optimization technique that is used for both performance targeting and reactor network synthesis hildebrandt et al 1990 the ar is a collection of all possible output for all possible reactor designs by interpreting chemical processes as geometric objects that define a region of achievability without having to explicitly enumerate all possible design combinations hildebrandt and glasser 1990 central to the ar concept is the availability of reliable kinetic models of all fundamental processes e g biochemical physicochemical physical in the case of ad occurring within the system in particular simplified kinetic process models are emphasized as the ar theory involves mixing and attainability of states through a relatively complex geometric and hydrodynamic analysis hildebrandt et al 1990 ming et al 2016 the novel idea presented in this study is that instead of using ar to define an optimal performance target which can only be achieved some of the times due to kinetic uncertainty the authors define a near optimal performance target which can be attained all the time this however involves an acceptable loss in process performance resulting from the kinetic uncertainty anaerobic digester systems designed with such an acceptable loss in performance resulting from uncertainty in kinetic coefficients are referred to as self optimizing self optimizing operation also referred to as self optimizing design systems permin et al 2016 gausemeier et al 2006 is when we can achieve an acceptable loss by using constant setpoint values for design operation variables e g temperature kinetics substrate characteristics etc for the case of anaerobic digestion without the need to reoptimize when variations occur in the case of this study we define self optimizing operation as an attainable region or performance target that results in near optimal operation despite variations in kinetic coefficients of the process in the context of process engineering a similar concept has been applied to plant wide control known as self optimizing control characterized by the choice of self optimizing controlled variables skogestad 2000 jäschke et al 2017 in order to illustrate the applicability of the framework presented in fig 1 the modified hill model published by finn et al 2013 was selected as a case study the model considers substrate effects and applies to anaerobic digestion of animal manure diary poultry beef or swine wastes and predicts acidogens methanogens organic substrate and volatile acids in addition the model eliminates the need for factors such as alkalinity concentration of cation dissolved co2 and ammonia gas because their effect is already lumped into two important parameters found in the model the biodegradability constant b 0 and acidity factor a f even though the modified hill model has been selected it is important for readers to note that the major contribution of this study is the development of a systematic framework which couples practical identifiability uncertainty quantification and attainable region ar concepts for defining process performance targets and synthesizing anaerobic digester networks especially when reliable kinetic coefficients are unavailable the framework can be used for any other dynamic model selected to describe the kinetics of the anerobic treatment process our recent studies have been first to illustrate the usefulness of ar to define performance targets and model digester configurations that optimize methane productivity and volatile solids reduction abunde neba et al 2019c as well as stability of methanogenic archaea abunde neba et al 2019b both studies put together have illustrated that a change in the kinetic model structure or value of kinetic coefficients induced by differences in substrate and inoculum characteristics significantly influences the performance target as well as the optimal digester configuration required to achieve the target in another recent study by the authors a framework was developed and embedded into a software for using simplified microbial kinetic models for ar analysis in cases where data requirements are limited abunde neba et al 2020a the integration of economic feasibility indicators such as payback period benefit cost ratio net present value and internal rate of returns with attainable region analysis has also been presented by the authors which is very interesting for synthesizing digester structures based on economic objectives abunde neba et al 2019a finally another approach which only relies on experimental data no model required is developed by coupling attainable regions and fuzzy multicriteria decision making for selection of digester subunits and synthesis of digester network configurations abunde neba et al 2020b it is interesting to mention at this point that unlike other model based studies on ar which assume that the kinetic coefficients of a model are known before constructing the attainable regions this study is novel in that it rather quantifies the uncertainty in the kinetic coefficients and propagates it onto the attainable regions the authors call such regions self optimizing attainable regions because they will always be attained even if variations occur in kinetic coefficients once the ar is obtained its boundary can always be interpreted into digester structures which can be used for industrial operation in order to achieve the performance target defined by the region 2 theoretical concepts and methods description 2 1 model reliability assessment the reliability of a mechanistic model has to do with the degree of uncertainty the confidence band of its model parameters and it is influenced by three main factors sin et al 2009 2010a 1 the mathematical structure of the model 2 the nature of the experimental data used for identification and 3 the set of model parameters used in the identification process in this paper the focus is on analyzing the relation amongst model structure factor 1 identifiable set of parameters factor 2 and reliability of anaerobic digestion model although the discussion of the results is extended to also reflect on the impact of the information content in the experimental data factor 2 given a kinetic model for a process we define the following three key steps needed to completely assess the reliability and usage of the model step 1 perform a sensitivity based identifiability to determine the identifiable set of model parameters step 2 estimate the identifiable set of model parameters and quantify the confidence band step 3 quantify the model prediction output uncertainty using the unidentifiable parameter set as inputs for studying the identifiability of the biokinetic models the sensitivity and collinearity analysis are used for parameter estimation the method of first order gradients with gradients computed using the discrete adjoint method was used and 95 joint and marginal confidence regions were used to assess the identifiability following parameter estimation for the input output uncertainty analysis the monte carlo simulation procedure was used the objective of this section is to analyze the aforementioned necessary steps with respect to its application to the anaerobic treatment process however the analysis requires that the process model is known and we therefore begin by describing the model of the anaerobic treatment process 2 1 1 model selection and description a number of simplified state space dynamic models for the anaerobic digestion process have been reviewed by finn et al 2013 the modified hill model which was developed for anaerobic digestion of animal manure diary poultry beef and swine wastes was selected for this study the model lumps the effect of hydrolysis alkalinity cation concentration dissolved carbon dioxide and ammonia into two important constants the biodegradability constant bo and acidity factor af present in the modified hill model the hill model is a mechanistic model parameters have a physical meaning which makes it interesting to understand the identifiability characteristics of the model the identifiability characteristics of a model relates to set of parameters to be estimated in order to accurately describe the observed mechanisms described by the model donoso bravo et al 2013 an overcalibrated model would accurately describe fit experimental data but would lose its capability to predict donoso bravo et al 2011 which weakens the model s reliability and hence applicability for design purposes fig 2 presents an illustration of the model by showing the flow of information between four compartments in the methane bioreactor which include inoculum substrate liquid phase and gas phase the species conservation and biogas production equations for the modified hills model is presented as follows a biodegradable volatile solids s 1 in the liquid phase of the bioreactor 1 d s 1 d t s 1 i n s 1 d k 1 μ 1 x 1 b volatile fatty acids s 2 in the liquid phase of

of volatile fatty acids contained in the substrate per unit mass of biodegradable volatile solids 6 s 1 i n b 0 s i n 7 s 2 i n a f s 1 i n in the modified hill model the anaerobic biodegradability

methanogenic microorganisms 12 μ 1 μ m 1 s 1 k s 1 s 1 it is known that anaerobic digestion is sensitive to a wide range of inhibitory conditions either from toxic substrates or by products of microbial metabolism chen et al 2014 since the methanogenic archaea are most sensitive to inhibition than any other group of anaerobic microorganisms chen et al 2008 the monod function used to describe the growth rate of methanogenic archaea will be replaced by an inhibition counterpart the haldane model eq 13 the haldane model is suited for growth processes affected by the allosteric effectors present in the acidified substrate non competitive inhibition kythreotou et al 2014 13 μ 2 μ m 2 s 2 k s 2 s 2 1 s 2 k i after having defined the kinetic model we now proceed with assessing the model s reliability for synthesis of anaerobic digesters 2 1 2 sensitivity based identifiability model sensitivity analysis provides dynamic information on how the states of a process vary with changes in the model parameters this information can be used to identify time intervals where experimental data points carry more or less importance for the parameter estimation process for instance if the sensitivity of a model state to a given parameter is zero or close to zero in some time interval then variations in that parameter would have a little influence on that state variable what this means in practical operation is that having a more accurate experimental measurement of the state variable at that insensitive time interval will not serve to improve the reliability of the parameter estimate the sensitivity based identifiability consist of analyzing the sensitivity of the model states to the model parameters and using these sensitivities to screen for parameter significance ranking by calculating a sensitivity measure δ k m s q r and for analyzing the near linear dependency between parameters by a measure called the collinearity index k given a model for a process the following five key steps needs to be performed in order to completely assess the reliability and usage of the model brun et al 2002 step 1 compute the absolute sensitivity since we do not have an explicit solution to the differential equation model the absolute sensitivities must be computed using the sensitivity equations for an n dimensional system given by eq 14 14 y f t y β y 0 y 0 with state variable y r n the parameter β r p and y 0 the initial condition the matrix of sensitivities y β satisfy 15 d d t y β f y y β f β with initial conditions 16 y 0 β 0 n p y β is the jacobian of the system the sensitivity equations are coupled with the original model differential equations and solved to obtain the parameter sensitivities for the necessary time points the resulting matrix of absolute sensitivities at time point t s a t y β will be of the form shown by eq 17 17 s a t s a 11 s a 12 s a 1 p s a 21 s a 22 s a 2 p s a n 1 s a 12 s a n p step 2 compute the non dimensional sensitivity the sensitivities of the observables are scaled using the same weights as in eq 18 resulting in scaled sensitivities for an output j and a parameter i 18 s n d s a t w the non dimensional scaling weighting matrix w is of the form shown by eq 19 while the resulting non dimensional sensitivity of the form given by eq 20 19 w β 1 s c 1 β 2 s c 1 β p s c 1 β 1 s c 2 β 2 s c 2 β p s c 2 β 1 s c 3 β 2 s c 3 β p s c n 20 s n d t s n d 11 s n d 12 s n d 1 p s n d 21 s n d 22 s n d 2 p s n d n 1 s n d 12 s n d n p step 3 compute the sensitivity measure from the matrix of non dimensional sensitivities we compute an overall coring for each parameter called root mean squared sensitivity δ k m s q r to consider changes in time or across experiments the root mean squared sensitivity is computed using eq 21 21 δ k m s q r 1 n l 1 n s n d l k 2 n is the number of state variables and k 1 2 p where p is the number of model parameters a vector of root mean squared sensitivities of the different model parameters is created of the form given by eq 22 22 δ m s q r δ 1 m s q r δ 2 m s q r δ p m s q r the sensitivity measure δ m s q r measures the relative importance of the parameters with respect to how the influence the model outputs states the higher the magnitude of the sensitivity measure the more important the influence of the parameter on the states step 4 compute the normalized sensitivity from the matrix of non dimensional sensitivity we compute the normalized sensitivity for each parameter using eq 23 re written as eq 24 23 s n o r m s n d l k s n d t 24 s n o r m s n d l k k 1 n s n d l k 2 l 1 2 n k 1 2 p step 5 compute the collinearity index finally step five consist of computing the collinearity index γ k using eq 25 25 γ k 1 min λ k λ k e i g e n s n o r m k t s n o r m k k stands for the index of the parameter subset which is a combinatorial function of the parameter vector β if the sensitivity functions of two or more parameters are orthogonal implying parameters are independent the index of that parameter subset k is equal to unity but if the parameters are linearly dependent the index approaches infinity in order to find an identifiable parameter subset a threshold value 1 15 is usually used brun et al 2002 sin and vanrolleghem 2007 where by any parameter subset having an index k greater than the threshold is said to be unidentifiable 2 1 3 parameter estimation confidence bounds and correlation analysis in this section we describe the adjoint based gradient method for parameter estimation the method is selected rather than the standard finite difference method because it takes less computing time and is less sensitive to round off and truncation errors which becomes very attractive for optimization problems with large number of variables benítez et al 2017 to facilitate mathematical developments in subsequent sections we redefine the model states and parameters as follows y 1 s 1 y 2 s 2 y 3 x 1 y 4 x 2

nonlinear optimization problem where the constraints are differential algebraic equations in order to find the numerical solution of the problem there exist indirect and direct methods of minimization of the objective function in the direct method the state equations are influenced only by the parameters and the minimization of the function is done by direct adjustment of the model parameters the simplest approach to a direct method is that of first order gradients in which the state and co state equations remain separated the system of continuous equations is regarded as a limiting case of a system of discrete equations as the time of a subinterval approaches zero the optimization problem is solved using the method of conjugate gradients with the gradient computed by the adjoint method the conjugate gradient algorithm is illustrated as follows given j r n r and j β let β 0 be the initial guess and set w 0 β j β 0 f o r k 0 1 2 3 step 1 perform a line search in the direction of to

and 64bits operating system 2 1 4 uncertainty quantification in model predictions as mentioned in section 1 self optimizing operation of anaerobic digesters is when we have an acceptable loss in performance as a result of kinetic uncertainty in the model in order to therefore use the model to model the self optimizing performance target one needs to quantify the model prediction uncertainty resulting from uncertainty in kinetic coefficients in order to quantify the model prediction uncertainty the monte carlo simulation procedure presented in fig 3 was applied in a similar way as in sin et al 2010b input output uncertainty analysis is highly dependent on the input uncertainty range confidence bounds as well as correlation coefficients the variance metrics and correlation coefficients of the unidentifiable set of model parameters for the different biokinetic models were obtained by estimating the complete set of parameters identifiable and unidentifiable using the estimation procedure presented in section 2 1 3 2 2 self optimizing performance targeting given a set of reactions and associated kinetics the following five key steps needs to be performed in order to define the performance target of a process using attainable region analysis ming et al 2016 define the reaction dimension and feed set define the fundamental processes occurring in the system generate the ar using combinations of the fundamental processes interpret the ar boundary in terms of reactor equipment define the objective function and overlay this onto the ar to determine point of intersection with the ar boundary determine the specific reactor configuration required to achieve the intersection point the previous two bullet points are important if the attainable region is to be used to answer a specific design or optimization question some necessary conditions for ar can be summarized as follows hildebrandt and glasser 1990 hildebrandt et al 1990 the ar includes all feeds to the system the ar is convex no process vector point out of the ar boundary no rate vectors in the complement of the ar when extended backward intersects the ar the objective of this section is to analyze the aforementioned necessary requirements with respect to its application to the anaerobic treatment process 2 2 1 reaction scheme and process kinetics using the information flow diagram of the kinetic model presented in fig 2 a stoichiometric scheme of the bioreaction occurring in the anaerobic digester consist of two main reactions catalyzed by acid forming bacteria eq 33 and methane forming bacteria eq 34 33 k 1 s 1 r x 1 x 1 k 2 s 2 34 k 3 s 2 r x 2 x 2 k 4 c h 4 if we assume the specific death rate to be negligible compared to the specific growth rate of both microbial populations the rate expressions for the different reaction species is defined by eq 35 38 35 r x 1 μ 1 x 1 36 r x 2 μ 2 x 2 37 r s 1 k 1 μ 1 x 1 38 r s 2 k 2 μ 1 x 1 k 3 μ 2 x 2 2 2 2 fundamental processes various fundamental processes can occur within a system which for bioreactors may include mass transfer mixing bioreaction biodegradation bioconversion adsorption heat transfer etc the ar approach requires the fundamental processes taking place in the system be identified the following two main fundamental processes are identified to be associated with the anaerobic treatment process biodegradation and mixing the attainable region ar for the anaerobic treatment process therefore represents the set of all possible states that can be achieved by a combination the two fundamental processes biodegradation and mixing in ar theory mixing is performed by a continuous stirred tank reactor cstr while reaction biodegradation is achieved in a plug flow reactor pfr since the operation of both reactors respectively mimic the two fundamental processes at steady state operation the general mathematical representation of a cstr and pfr are given by eqs 39 and 40 respectively 39 c c f τ r c 40 d c d τ r c c is the state vector while r c is the reaction rate vector as shown by eqs 41 and 42 respectively 41 c x 1 x 2 s 1 s 2 t 42 r c r x 1 r x 2 r s 1 r s 2 t 2 2 3 dimensionality analysis and model reduction the reaction stoichiometry of the system can be used to determine the dimension of the system the dimension of the ar is determined from the number of independent reactions occurring in the reactor system which defines the dimension of the stoichiometric subspace the rank of the stoichiometric coefficient matrix a in which the ar must reside since there are two independent reactions occurring in the system the set of points generated by the anaerobic treatment process must reside in a two dimensional subspace in r 5 ming et al 2016 the reduced state and reaction rate vectors are therefore presented by eqs 43 and 44 43 c s 2 x 2 t 44 r c r s 2 r x 2 t the reduction involved expressing s 1 and x 1 as a function of s 2 and x 2 as shown by eqs 45 and 46 45 s 1 s 1 i n k 1 x 1 x 1 i n 46 x 1 x 1 i n 1 k 2 s 2 s 2 i n k 3 x 2 x 2 i n this reduction in the dimensions of the state and rate vectors was done using the approach illustrate in our recent study using attainable regions for synthesis and optimization of methane bioreactors ref the model reduction assumes that the specific death rates of acidogens and methanogens is negligible compared to their respective specific growth rates 2 2 4 ar construction and defining performance target for the system after stating the process kinetics the ar construction process is initiated by defining feed point and process conditions that influence the system in anaerobic treatment the digester is normally maintained at constant temperature isothermal process throughout retention time which makes the ar dependent on the particular temperature in the system the anaerobic digestion was carried out under mesophilic conditions at a temperature of 35 c using the specified feed kinetics and temperature conditions the set of points generated by solving the pfr equation are called the pfr trajectory and those generated by solving the cstr equation are called the cstr locus the convex hull of the set of points generated by the system defines the attainable region which represents the limits of achievability by the system 3 results and discussion in this section data from a real experiment is utilized to illustrate the theories presented in the previous sections the case study is based on a batch methane bioreactor operated with diary manure where experimental measurements of volatile fatty acids and methane gas flowrate which can be used to get the concentration of methanogenic archae were obtained zaher et al 2009 3 1 parameter identifiability measures 3 1 1 sensitivity analysis in this section the objective was to determine which set of parameters should be estimated to accurately describe the mechanisms of the anaerobic digestion process this depends on analyzing the sensitivity function of the model parameters with respect to with respect to the states fig 4 presents the sensitivity functions dynamic sensitivities of the states for the parameters of the biokinetic model from the shape of the sensitivity functions the authors made the following remarks 1 all the states show some sensitivity to the model parameters which can either be a negative or positive sensitivity 2 the anaerobic microorganisms mostly show negative sensitivity while the substrates show both negative and positive sensitivities to the model parameters table 1 presents the numerical characteristics sensitivity analysis which include the nominal values and scale of the model parameters the mean minimum and maximum values of the dynamic sensitivities the sensitivity measures l1 and l2 as well as the number of data points n the 130 data points corresponds to the small time step of 0 0769 that was used to integrate the sensitivity equations from 0 to 10days particularly it is worth mentioning that for the substrates the biodegradable volatile solids is most sensitive to the acid yield coefficient k 2 while volatile fatty acids are most sensitivity to the monod saturation constant for volatile acids k s 2 and inhibition constant k i for the anaerobic microorganisms the acidogenic bacteria is highly sensitive to the monod saturation constant k s 2 while the methanogenic archae are highly sensitive to inhibition constant k i these outcome accurately describe the underlying theories of the anaerobic treatment process which include breakdown of volatile solids into volatile fatty acids by acidogenic bacteria utilization of volatile fatty acids for growth of methanogenic archaea as well as high sensitivity of methanogenic archaea to inhibitions henze et al 2008 wang et al 2007 hence the results clearly illustrate the ability of the model to describe the anaerobic digestion process fig 5 presents the use of the sensitivity measure sum of sensitivity functions of the available measurements with respect to parameters to rank the model parameters which reveals the relative significance of the parameters with respect to the observable states only the relative ranking for volatile acids methanogenic archaea as well as volatile acids methanogenic archae as model as model outputs are considered this is because the experimental data which is used as our case study only contains measurements for volatile acids methanogenic archae calculated form methane flowrate and we therefore determine the set of model parameters that are identifiable considering these two observable states it is noteworthy that the yield coefficient k 1 is found completely not sensitive to any of the observable states the inhibition constant k i was found most significant for all the observable states followed by the yield coefficient k 3 the monod constants k s 1 and k s 2 and the yield coefficient k 2 were found significant albeit to a relatively lower degree the practical relevance of the parameter significance ranking is that only those parameters with significant sensitivity measure with respect to the observable states can be identified therefore considering volatile fatty acids and methanogenic archaea as the only observable states in the system the yield coefficient k 1 cannot be identified from the available data since it has a sensitivity measure of zero this implies only 5 out of the 6 model parameters can be candidates for parameter estimation 3 1 2 collinearity analysis this section of the identifiability analysis only considers those set of parameters 5 out of the 6 model parameters were significant which have a significant effect on the observable states the collinearity analysis screens all possible subsets of the potential candidate parameters to determine the identifiable subsets using a collinearity index the five potential candidates for parameter estimation gives a total of approximately 31 parameter subset combinations with a maximum subset size of five parameters fig 6 a presents the collinearity analysis for all possible combinations of parameter subsets while fig 6b presents collinearity analysis for the potentially identifiable subsets from fig 6 it can be observed that of the 31 possible subset combinations only 18 are potentially identifiable those having collinearity index less than 15 and with a maximum identifiable subset size of three parameters these findings suggest that for a given set of observable states experimental measurements there exist many identifiable subset combinations of model parameters having a maximum number of parameters that can be estimated uniquely unique estimation means that by using an identifiable subset the estimated parameters should have a relatively lower correlation values and or confidence intervals the results corroborate the theoretical premise that subjecting an overparameterized model to limited quality quantity of data limits the number of parameter that can be estimated to uniquely and accurately describe the system brun et al 2002 sin and vanrolleghem 2007 3 2 model fits and parameter uncertainty two cases of parameter estimation were considered one with an identifiable subset specifically k 2 k s 2 and k i and one with all the model parameters known as the nominal case so that the effect of identifiability analysis can be ascertained the model fits for both cases are presented in fig 7 while parameter estimates together with their 95 marginal confidence intervals are shown in table 2 visually both cases show a good fit between the experimental measurements and model predictions with no observable difference in both cases however from a numerical perspective see table 2 the parameter estimates from the nominal case shows a much higher degree of uncertainty given as the standard deviation which relates to the 95 marginal confidence interval than that of the identifiable case put it in another way the identifiability analysis has served to reduce the degree of uncertainty in model parameter estimates the results indicate that despite variation in parameter uncertainty the quality of the model fit to experimental data is not compromised and using an identifiable subset of model parameters serves to improve the quality of the model parameters it is worth mentioning that the identifiable parameter subset utilized for parameter estimation is just one of the three identifiable subsets available with size of 3 other three parameter combinations of identifiable subsets can still be selected as candidates for the parameter estimation the focus of this study is not to consider all the identifiable subset but to illustrate how these identifiability issues should be incorporated in digester synthesis 3 3 uncertainty quantification on model states recall from step 3 of section 2 which stated the need to quantify the model prediction state uncertainty using the unidentifiable parameter set as inputs from section 3 2 we have demonstrated the use of an identifiable parameter subset k 2 k s 2 and k i to reduce uncertainty in model parameters even though the use of an identifiable subset reduces parameter uncertainty it causes another problem which is that of model uncertainty this is because those parameters that are not identifiable k 1 k 2 and k s 1 need to be kept constant probably using values estimated from previous studies or independent experiments which influences the reliability of the model since the geometric optimization technique of attainable regions presented in this study for synthesis of anaerobic digesters is unique for a given kinetic model an unreliable model will therefore result in an unreliable digester system which can easily lead to operational failure hence before using the model to construct the attainable regions which can be interpreted into digester structures we quantify and incorporate the model prediction uncertainty into the limits of achievability of the system which is defined by the attainable regions fig 8 presents the results obtained from the monte carlo simulations from a general perspective the results indicate that each of the model states have a time varying uncertainty band defined by the 10th and the 90th percentile the methanogenic archaea shows insignificant uncertainty band to the model inputs at certain times instants where the mean 10th and 90th percentile are equal the width of the band difference between the 10th and the 90th percentile describes the spread of the distribution of the model states resulting from parameter uncertainty and the larger the width the higher the degree of model output uncertainty this is often called mapping propagating parameter input uncertainty onto states output uncertainty the state uncertainty bands presented in fig 8 are highly dependent on the uncertainty range of the model parameters the study used the joint confidence region fig 9 of the sampled parameters which takes into consideration the correlation amongst model parameters and eliminates the need to define the correlation amongst model parameters during the monte carlo procedure the interpretation of these results is based on the relationship between uncertainty band and model quality the higher the uncertainty band the lower the model quality hence model predictions for biodegradable volatile solids followed by volatile fatty acids and acidogenic bacteria are deemed of low quality large uncertainty bands while that of methanogenic archaea can be deemed acceptable 3 4 self optimizing attainable regions surely whether of acceptable quality or not the prediction uncertainty around the model states affects the limits of achievability of the anaerobic digestion process and hence the nature of the optimal digester structures this is because for synthesis of methane bioreactors using attainable region analysis the predicted performance target or limits of achievability by the system is computed by the area of the convex hull for the set of states outputs achievable by the system hence when using attainable regions for performance targeting and digester network synthesis we suggest that it should be mandatory to incorporate uncertainty of model prediction during construction of the attainable regions the approach here relies on constructing the attainable regions using the three key points of the state s prediction mean 10th and 90th percentile and superposing the regions to obtain a robust region which considers the effect of uncertainty fig 10 presents the ar for the 10th percentile mean and 90th percentile state predictions on to which the digester structures required to attain points on the ar boundary has been overlaid a detailed explanation of how the ar boundary has been interpreted into digester structures is presented in our recent publication abunde neba et al 2019c it can be observed that for all the cases where the ar boundary is convex the optimal digester structure involves a plug flow digester in order to attain points on the ar boundary this can be explained by the intrinsic geometric characteristics of this type of reactor in relation to the properties of the ar boundary the ar boundary is composed entirely of reaction and mixing surfaces only reaction surfaces are always convex and the points that form convex sections of the ar boundary arise specifically from points on pfr trajectories ming et al 2016 this is so because governing equations of a pfr is a system of first order ordinary differential equations eq 17 where a phase plane presentation of the solution of the system for a given organic load and digestion time is called pfr trajectory geometrically the rate vector evaluated at points on the pfr trajectory is tangent to all points on the trajectory hildebrandt and glasser 1990 ming et al 2016 this implies the boundary of a true ar will always contain points originating from pfr trajectory otherwise it becomes a candidate ar fig 10d present the intersection of the three regions to define the self optimizing attainable region it can be observed that the region looks smaller than any of the three individual regions 10th percentile mean and 90th percentile this illustrates the accept loss in process operation mentioned in section 1 it is necessary here to re clarify exactly what is meant by self optimizing attainable regions unlike the attainable region which represents the set of all possible states that is attainable by the system for a defined kinetics and initial condition feed point the self optimizing attainable region represents the set of all possible states attainable by the system even in cases of kinetic uncertainty the size of the self optimizing attainable region is related to the domain of uncertainty defined for the unidentifiable set of model parameters used for the uncertainty propagation the presence of uncertainty reduces the size of the self optimizing ar and if the domain of uncertainty is reduced the size increases as mentioned in section 1 the attainable region defines the limits of achievability performance targets by a system this implies that considering uncertainty has greatly reduced the limits of achievability by the system even though we have benefited from increased robustness the authors will also like to clarify at this point that by performance targets the authors refer to the totality concentration of microorganisms and substrates that can be output by the different digester combinations using the fundamental processes occurring in the system this is defined by the attainable region of the system for a given kinetics and by the self optimizing attainable region for different kinetic variations within a defined domain the findings from this study are therefore highly important in making economic feasibility decisions about the performance of biogas plants especially in cases where accuracy is very necessary put it in another way when assessing the economic feasibility of the anaerobic treatment process one can now consider the economic performance of the process even in cases of uncertainty and reliably compare it with other process alternatives in summary coupling uncertainty analysis and attainable region theory provides a systematic methodological framework for dealing with kinetic uncertainty during design of biogas digesters and hence allows biogas engineers to benefit from the advantages of model based design these advantages include easy digester scale up less experimental runs hence less cost as well as obtain optimal design parameters and digester configurations this approach is therefore recommended as a reliable strategy for design of biogas plants in cases of kinetic uncertainty which is very common with biokinetic models for anaerobic digestion 4 conclusion a systematic model based framework for the synthesis of biogas reactors under cases of kinetic uncertainty has been developed using the case of the modified hill model for anaerobic digestion the following conclusions are made identifiability analysis reveals that only 5 out of the 6 model parameters can be candidates for parameter estimation the 5 potential candidates for parameter estimation gives a total of approximately 31 parameter subset combinations with a maximum subset size of 5 of the 31 possible subset combinations only 18 are potentially identifiable and with a maximum identifiable subset size of 3 parameter estimation indicates that despite variation in parameter uncertainty the quality of the model fit to experimental data is not compromised and using an identifiable subset of model parameters serves reduce the degree of uncertainty confidence interval in model parameter estimates following sensitivity analysis the biodegradable volatile solids are most sensitive to the acid yield coefficient k 2 while volatile fatty acids are most sensitivity to the monod saturation constant for volatile acids k s 2 and inhibition constant k i for the anaerobic microorganisms the acidogenic bacteria is highly sensitive to the monod saturation constant k s 2 while the methanogenic archae are highly sensitive to inhibition constant k i uncertainty quantification reveals that of the four model states the methanogenic archaea shows an insignificant uncertainty band to the model inputs at certain times instants while all the other sates show a degree of significant uncertainty to the model inputs at all times instants the systematic model based framework proposed in this study has been based on the concept of attainable regions hence when using attainable regions for performance targeting and digester network synthesis we suggest that it should be mandatory to incorporate uncertainty of model prediction during construction of the attainable regions the attainable region obtained in such cases is referred to as a self optimizing attainable region which is generally smaller than the attainable region it is concluded that incorporating kinetic uncertainty onto attainable regions has greatly reduces the limits of achievability by the system even though we have benefited from increased robustness when the ar is obtained the boundary of the ar can be interpreted into digester structures whereby the optimal digester structure always involves a plug flow digester in combination with either a cstr and or bypass streams in summary coupling identifiability analysis uncertainty quantification and the attainable region theory provides a systematic methodological framework for defining the performance targets of the anaerobic treatment process under conditions of uncertainty it is also worth mentioning that even though the study is based on the anaerobic treatment process the framework can be applied to optimally design other environmental chemical processes which can be described with a kinetic model more research is needed to extend the concept of self optimizing attainable regions in the field of anaerobic digestion this study has focused on kinetic uncertainty and it would be interesting to assess the effects of other potential sources of uncertainty such as substrate characteristics presence of inhibitions or temperature variations on the performance targets

18177,despite the advantage of model based design anaerobic digesters are seldom designed using biokinetic models due to lack of reliable kinetic coefficients and or systematic approaches for incorporating kinetic models into digester design this study presents a systematic framework which couples practical identifiability uncertainty quantification and attainable region ar concepts for defining process performance targets especially when reliable kinetic coefficients are unavailable within the framework we introduce the concept of self optimizing ars which define performance targets that results in near optimal operation in spite of variations in kinetic coefficients using the case of modified hill model only 3 out of the 6 model parameters unidentifiable set are responsible for the model prediction uncertainty the uncertainty bands mean 10th percentile and 90th percentile on the model states has been computed using the monte carlo simulation procedure and attainable regions for the different levels of uncertainty has been constructed and the boundaries interpreted into digester structures the self optimizing attainable regions have been defined as the intersection region of the attainable regions corresponding to the mean 10th percentile and 90th percentile incorporating uncertainty significantly reduces performance targets of the process but increases self optimality in defining performance targets unlike the attainable region which represents the limits of achievability for defined kinetics the self optimizing attainable region represents the set of all possible states attainable by the system even in cases of kinetic uncertainty in summary the concept of self optimizing ars provides a systematic way of defining process performance targets and making economic decisions under conditions of uncertainty graphical abstract graphical abstract showing the self optimizing attainable region image 1 keywords self optimizing attainable regions practical identifiability uncertainty quantification anaerobic digester synthesis 1 introduction anaerobic digestion ad of animal manure is of great importance to the waste treatment and bioenergy industries since the biomethane produced is a promising renewable energy alternative to fossil fuels the modelling of anaerobic treatment process is a mature research area now with a strong shift from model development towards application development aimed at solving various design and operational challenges various models have been constructed to describe the anaerobic treatment process and the key motivations for model development have mainly been operational analysis technology development as well as digester design batstone 2006 the model based design is particularly important as the capital cost for anaerobic digesters determined from design is a key motivation for implementers the kinetics captured by ad models is highly important for an optimal digester design since operating conditions volumetric gas production process stability finn et al 2013 yu et al 2013 batstone 2006 kythreotou et al 2014 as well as effluent quality can be predicted kythreotou et al 2014 yu et al 2013 despite the advantage of model based design anaerobic digesters are seldom designed using biokinetic models but rather based on a combination of hydraulic and organic loading where the digester capacity is determined for a given loading rate temperature regime mixing etc wang et al 2007 this is because the use of biokinetic models is highly dependent upon availability of kinetic coefficients batstone 2006 wang et al 2007 but it is often difficult to get reliable kinetic parameters in practical operation which results in kinetic uncertainty and hence uncertain process performance if the models are used for digester design summarily three main challenges can be mentioned with the use of models to design anaerobic digesters 1 lack of systematic approaches for incorporating process kinetics in digester design 2 the reliability of some of the studies using kinetic models to guide design of anaerobic digesters is undermined by uncertainty existing in the in kinetic coefficients 3 existing model based studies are limited to single stage digesters and operating the process as a single stage generally limits overall performance this is supported by the fact that ad involves multiple bioreactions steps each step catalyzed by a specific group of microorganisms and when operated as a single stage it limits the possible combination of pathways since the process conditions are only suitable for all microorganisms with no reaction being optimized epa 2006 however most of the modeling studies on ad have focused on the model development approach techniques for parameter estimation with less effort devoted to assessing model reliability identifiability and uncertainty or how to incorporate uncertainty in digester design and operation a systematic approach for handling kinetic uncertainty in design of anaerobic digesters with focus on multi stage anaerobic digesters networks as opposed to single stage systems will be a breakthrough in advancing model based optimization of anaerobic digestion this study is therefore designed to develop a systematic model based framework fig 1 for performance targeting and synthesis of anaerobic digester networks when reliable kinetic models are not available the framework fig 1 is realized in two phases which may involve feedback checks at specific steps depending on the system performance after every step in the first phase model reliability assessment one selects a kinetic model appropriate for a digested substrate of interest e g solid waste sludge wastewater etc assesses the model s reliability and quantifies the model prediction uncertainty resulting from kinetic uncertainty in the second phase self optimizing design one mainly defines the robust performance targets of the system considering the uncertainty bounds computed in phase 1 phase 2 is based on the concept of attainable regions which is a geometric optimization technique that is used for both performance targeting and reactor network synthesis hildebrandt et al 1990 the ar is a collection of all possible output for all possible reactor designs by interpreting chemical processes as geometric objects that define a region of achievability without having to explicitly enumerate all possible design combinations hildebrandt and glasser 1990 central to the ar concept is the availability of reliable kinetic models of all fundamental processes e g biochemical physicochemical physical in the case of ad occurring within the system in particular simplified kinetic process models are emphasized as the ar theory involves mixing and attainability of states through a relatively complex geometric and hydrodynamic analysis hildebrandt et al 1990 ming et al 2016 the novel idea presented in this study is that instead of using ar to define an optimal performance target which can only be achieved some of the times due to kinetic uncertainty the authors define a near optimal performance target which can be attained all the time this however involves an acceptable loss in process performance resulting from the kinetic uncertainty anaerobic digester systems designed with such an acceptable loss in performance resulting from uncertainty in kinetic coefficients are referred to as self optimizing self optimizing operation also referred to as self optimizing design systems permin et al 2016 gausemeier et al 2006 is when we can achieve an acceptable loss by using constant setpoint values for design operation variables e g temperature kinetics substrate characteristics etc for the case of anaerobic digestion without the need to reoptimize when variations occur in the case of this study we define self optimizing operation as an attainable region or performance target that results in near optimal operation despite variations in kinetic coefficients of the process in the context of process engineering a similar concept has been applied to plant wide control known as self optimizing control characterized by the choice of self optimizing controlled variables skogestad 2000 jäschke et al 2017 in order to illustrate the applicability of the framework presented in fig 1 the modified hill model published by finn et al 2013 was selected as a case study the model considers substrate effects and applies to anaerobic digestion of animal manure diary poultry beef or swine wastes and predicts acidogens methanogens organic substrate and volatile acids in addition the model eliminates the need for factors such as alkalinity concentration of cation dissolved co2 and ammonia gas because their effect is already lumped into two important parameters found in the model the biodegradability constant b 0 and acidity factor a f even though the modified hill model has been selected it is important for readers to note that the major contribution of this study is the development of a systematic framework which couples practical identifiability uncertainty quantification and attainable region ar concepts for defining process performance targets and synthesizing anaerobic digester networks especially when reliable kinetic coefficients are unavailable the framework can be used for any other dynamic model selected to describe the kinetics of the anerobic treatment process our recent studies have been first to illustrate the usefulness of ar to define performance targets and model digester configurations that optimize methane productivity and volatile solids reduction abunde neba et al 2019c as well as stability of methanogenic archaea abunde neba et al 2019b both studies put together have illustrated that a change in the kinetic model structure or value of kinetic coefficients induced by differences in substrate and inoculum characteristics significantly influences the performance target as well as the optimal digester configuration required to achieve the target in another recent study by the authors a framework was developed and embedded into a software for using simplified microbial kinetic models for ar analysis in cases where data requirements are limited abunde neba et al 2020a the integration of economic feasibility indicators such as payback period benefit cost ratio net present value and internal rate of returns with attainable region analysis has also been presented by the authors which is very interesting for synthesizing digester structures based on economic objectives abunde neba et al 2019a finally another approach which only relies on experimental data no model required is developed by coupling attainable regions and fuzzy multicriteria decision making for selection of digester subunits and synthesis of digester network configurations abunde neba et al 2020b it is interesting to mention at this point that unlike other model based studies on ar which assume that the kinetic coefficients of a model are known before constructing the attainable regions this study is novel in that it rather quantifies the uncertainty in the kinetic coefficients and propagates it onto the attainable regions the authors call such regions self optimizing attainable regions because they will always be attained even if variations occur in kinetic coefficients once the ar is obtained its boundary can always be interpreted into digester structures which can be used for industrial operation in order to achieve the performance target defined by the region 2 theoretical concepts and methods description 2 1 model reliability assessment the reliability of a mechanistic model has to do with the degree of uncertainty the confidence band of its model parameters and it is influenced by three main factors sin et al 2009 2010a 1 the mathematical structure of the model 2 the nature of the experimental data used for identification and 3 the set of model parameters used in the identification process in this paper the focus is on analyzing the relation amongst model structure factor 1 identifiable set of parameters factor 2 and reliability of anaerobic digestion model although the discussion of the results is extended to also reflect on the impact of the information content in the experimental data factor 2 given a kinetic model for a process we define the following three key steps needed to completely assess the reliability and usage of the model step 1 perform a sensitivity based identifiability to determine the identifiable set of model parameters step 2 estimate the identifiable set of model parameters and quantify the confidence band step 3 quantify the model prediction output uncertainty using the unidentifiable parameter set as inputs for studying the identifiability of the biokinetic models the sensitivity and collinearity analysis are used for parameter estimation the method of first order gradients with gradients computed using the discrete adjoint method was used and 95 joint and marginal confidence regions were used to assess the identifiability following parameter estimation for the input output uncertainty analysis the monte carlo simulation procedure was used the objective of this section is to analyze the aforementioned necessary steps with respect to its application to the anaerobic treatment process however the analysis requires that the process model is known and we therefore begin by describing the model of the anaerobic treatment process 2 1 1 model selection and description a number of simplified state space dynamic models for the anaerobic digestion process have been reviewed by finn et al 2013 the modified hill model which was developed for anaerobic digestion of animal manure diary poultry beef and swine wastes was selected for this study the model lumps the effect of hydrolysis alkalinity cation concentration dissolved carbon dioxide and ammonia into two important constants the biodegradability constant bo and acidity factor af present in the modified hill model the hill model is a mechanistic model parameters have a physical meaning which makes it interesting to understand the identifiability characteristics of the model the identifiability characteristics of a model relates to set of parameters to be estimated in order to accurately describe the observed mechanisms described by the model donoso bravo et al 2013 an overcalibrated model would accurately describe fit experimental data but would lose its capability to predict donoso bravo et al 2011 which weakens the model s reliability and hence applicability for design purposes fig 2 presents an illustration of the model by showing the flow of information between four compartments in the methane bioreactor which include inoculum substrate liquid phase and gas phase the species conservation and biogas production equations for the modified

methanogenic microorganisms 12 μ 1 μ m 1 s 1 k s 1 s 1 it is known that anaerobic digestion is sensitive to a wide range of inhibitory conditions either from toxic substrates or by products of microbial metabolism chen et al 2014 since the methanogenic archaea are most sensitive to inhibition than any other group of anaerobic microorganisms chen et al 2008 the monod function used to describe the growth rate of methanogenic archaea will be replaced by an inhibition counterpart the haldane model eq 13 the haldane model is suited for growth processes affected by the allosteric effectors present in the acidified substrate non competitive inhibition kythreotou et al 2014 13 μ 2 μ m 2 s 2 k s 2 s 2 1 s 2 k i after having defined the kinetic model we now proceed with assessing the model s reliability for synthesis of anaerobic digesters 2 1 2 sensitivity based identifiability model sensitivity analysis provides dynamic information on how the states of a process vary with changes in the model parameters this information can be used to identify time intervals where experimental data points carry more or less importance for the parameter estimation process for instance if the sensitivity of a model state to a given parameter is zero or close to zero in some time interval then variations in that parameter would have a little influence on that state variable what this means in practical operation is that having a more accurate experimental measurement of the state variable at that insensitive time interval will not serve to improve the reliability of the parameter estimate the sensitivity based identifiability consist of analyzing the sensitivity of the model states to the model parameters and using these sensitivities to screen for parameter significance ranking by calculating a sensitivity measure δ k m s q r and for analyzing the near linear dependency between parameters by a measure called the collinearity index k given a model for a process the following five key steps needs to be performed in order to completely assess the reliability and usage of the model brun et al 2002 step 1 compute the absolute sensitivity since we do not have an explicit solution to the differential equation model the absolute sensitivities must be computed using the sensitivity equations for an n dimensional system given by eq 14 14 y f t y β y 0 y 0 with state variable y r n the parameter β r p and y 0 the initial condition the matrix of sensitivities y β satisfy 15 d d t y β f y y β f β with initial conditions 16 y 0 β 0 n p y β is the jacobian of the system the sensitivity equations are coupled with the original model differential equations and solved to obtain the parameter sensitivities for the necessary time points the resulting matrix of absolute sensitivities at time point t s a t y β will be of the form shown by eq 17 17 s a t s a 11 s a 12 s a 1 p s a 21 s a 22 s a 2 p s a n 1 s a 12 s a n p step 2 compute the non dimensional sensitivity the sensitivities of the observables are scaled using the same weights as in eq 18 resulting in scaled sensitivities for an output j and a parameter i 18 s n d s a t w the non dimensional scaling weighting matrix w is of the form shown by eq 19 while the resulting non dimensional sensitivity of the form given by eq 20 19 w β 1 s c 1 β 2 s c 1 β p s c 1 β 1 s c 2 β 2 s c 2 β p s c 2 β 1 s c 3 β 2 s c 3 β p s c n 20 s n d t s n d 11 s n d 12 s n d 1 p s n d 21 s n d 22 s n d 2 p s n d n 1 s n d 12 s n d n p step 3 compute the sensitivity measure from the matrix of non dimensional sensitivities we compute an overall coring for each parameter called root mean squared sensitivity δ k m s q r to consider changes in time or across experiments the root mean squared sensitivity is computed using eq 21 21 δ k m s q r 1 n l 1 n s n d l k 2 n is the number of state variables and k 1 2 p where p is the number of model parameters a vector of root mean squared sensitivities of the different model parameters is created of the form given by eq 22 22 δ m s q r δ 1 m s q r δ 2 m s q r δ p m s q r the sensitivity measure δ m s q r measures the relative importance of the parameters with respect to how the influence the model outputs states the higher the magnitude of the sensitivity measure the more important the influence of the parameter on the states step 4 compute the normalized sensitivity from the matrix of non dimensional sensitivity we compute the normalized sensitivity for each parameter using eq 23 re written as eq 24 23 s n o r m s n d l k s n d t 24 s n o r m s n d l k k 1 n s n d l k 2 l 1 2 n k 1 2 p step 5 compute the collinearity index finally step five consist of computing the collinearity index γ k using eq 25 25 γ k 1 min λ k λ k e i g e n s n o r m k t s n o r m k k stands for the index of the parameter subset which is a combinatorial function of the parameter vector β if the sensitivity functions of two or more parameters are orthogonal implying parameters are independent the index of that parameter subset k is equal to unity but if the parameters are linearly dependent the index approaches infinity in order to find an identifiable parameter subset a threshold value 1 15 is usually used brun et al 2002 sin and vanrolleghem 2007 where by any parameter subset having an index k greater than the threshold is said to be unidentifiable 2 1 3 parameter estimation confidence bounds and correlation analysis in this section we describe the adjoint based gradient method for parameter estimation the method is selected rather than the standard finite difference method because it takes less computing time and is less sensitive to round off and truncation errors which becomes very attractive for optimization problems

nonlinear optimization problem where the constraints are differential algebraic equations in order to find the numerical solution of the problem there exist indirect and direct methods of minimization of the objective function in the direct method the state equations are influenced only by the parameters and the minimization of the function is done by direct adjustment of the model parameters the simplest approach to a direct method is that of first order gradients in which the state and co state equations remain separated the system of continuous equations is regarded as a limiting case of a system of discrete equations as the time of a subinterval approaches zero the optimization problem is solved using the method of conjugate gradients with the gradient computed by the adjoint method the conjugate gradient algorithm is illustrated as follows given j r n r and j β let β 0 be the initial guess and set w 0 β j β 0 f o r k 0 1 2 3 step 1 perform a line search in the direction of to

set k k 1 and return to step 2 until a termination condition is reached all the work on the computer was carried out using matlab r2017b mathworks natick using i7 6600u 2 6 ghz cpu pc with 16 gb ram and 64bits operating system 2 1 4 uncertainty quantification in model predictions as mentioned in section 1 self optimizing operation of anaerobic digesters is when we have an acceptable loss in performance as a result of kinetic uncertainty in the model in order to therefore use the model to model the self optimizing performance target one needs to quantify the model prediction uncertainty resulting from uncertainty in kinetic coefficients in order to quantify the model prediction uncertainty the monte carlo simulation procedure presented in fig 3 was applied in a similar way as in sin et al 2010b input output uncertainty analysis is highly dependent on the input uncertainty range confidence bounds as well as correlation coefficients the variance metrics and correlation coefficients of the unidentifiable set of model parameters for the different biokinetic models were obtained by estimating the complete set of parameters identifiable and unidentifiable using the estimation procedure presented in section 2 1 3 2 2 self optimizing performance targeting given a set of reactions and associated kinetics the following five key steps needs to be performed in order to define the performance target of a process using attainable region analysis ming et al 2016 define the reaction dimension and feed set define the fundamental processes occurring in the system generate the ar using combinations of the fundamental processes interpret the ar boundary in terms of reactor equipment define the objective function and overlay this onto the ar to determine point of intersection with the ar boundary determine the specific reactor configuration required to achieve the intersection point the previous two bullet points are important if the attainable region is to be used to answer a specific design or optimization question some necessary conditions for ar can be summarized as follows hildebrandt and glasser 1990 hildebrandt et al 1990 the ar includes all feeds to the system the ar is convex no process vector point out of the ar boundary no rate vectors in the complement of the ar when extended backward intersects the ar the objective of this section is to analyze the aforementioned necessary requirements with respect to its application to the anaerobic treatment process 2 2 1 reaction scheme and process kinetics using the information flow diagram of the kinetic model presented in fig 2 a stoichiometric scheme of the bioreaction occurring in the anaerobic digester consist of two main reactions catalyzed by acid forming bacteria eq 33 and methane forming bacteria eq 34 33 k 1 s 1 r x 1 x 1 k 2 s 2 34 k 3 s 2 r x 2 x 2 k 4 c h 4 if we assume the specific death rate to be negligible compared to the specific growth rate of both microbial populations the rate expressions for the different reaction species is defined by eq 35 38 35 r x 1 μ 1 x 1 36 r x 2 μ 2 x 2 37 r s 1 k 1 μ 1 x 1 38 r s 2 k 2 μ 1 x 1 k 3 μ 2 x 2 2 2 2 fundamental processes various fundamental processes can occur within a system which for bioreactors may include mass transfer mixing bioreaction biodegradation bioconversion adsorption heat transfer etc the ar approach requires the fundamental processes taking place in the system be identified the following two main fundamental processes are identified to be associated with the anaerobic treatment process biodegradation and mixing the attainable region ar for the anaerobic treatment process therefore represents the set of all possible states that can be achieved by a combination the two fundamental processes biodegradation and mixing in ar theory mixing is performed by a continuous stirred tank reactor cstr while reaction biodegradation is achieved in a plug flow reactor pfr since the operation of both reactors respectively mimic the two fundamental processes at steady state operation the general mathematical representation of a cstr and pfr are given by eqs 39 and 40 respectively 39 c c f τ r c 40 d c d τ r c c is the state vector while r c is the reaction rate vector as shown by eqs 41 and 42 respectively 41 c x 1 x 2 s 1 s 2 t 42 r c r x 1 r x 2 r s 1 r s 2 t 2 2 3 dimensionality analysis and model reduction the reaction stoichiometry of the system can be used to determine the dimension of the system the dimension of the ar is determined from the number of independent reactions occurring in the reactor system which defines the dimension of the stoichiometric subspace the rank of the stoichiometric coefficient matrix a in which the ar must reside since there are two independent reactions occurring in the system the set of points generated by the anaerobic treatment process must reside in a two dimensional subspace in r 5 ming et al 2016 the reduced state and reaction rate vectors are therefore presented by eqs 43 and 44 43 c s 2 x 2 t 44 r c r s 2 r x 2 t the reduction involved expressing s 1 and x 1 as a function of s 2 and x 2 as shown by eqs 45 and 46 45 s 1 s 1 i n k 1 x 1 x 1 i n 46 x 1 x 1 i n 1 k 2 s 2 s 2 i n k 3 x 2 x 2 i n this reduction in the dimensions of the state and rate vectors was done using the approach illustrate in our recent study using attainable regions for synthesis and optimization of methane bioreactors ref the model reduction assumes that the specific death rates of acidogens and methanogens is negligible compared to their respective specific growth rates 2 2 4 ar construction and defining performance target for the system after stating the process kinetics the ar construction process is initiated by defining feed point and process conditions that influence the system in anaerobic treatment the digester is normally maintained at constant temperature isothermal process throughout retention time which makes the ar dependent on the particular temperature in the system the anaerobic digestion was carried out under mesophilic conditions at a temperature of 35 c using the specified feed kinetics and temperature conditions the set of points generated by solving the pfr equation are called the pfr trajectory and those generated by solving the cstr equation are called the cstr locus the convex hull of the set of points generated by the system defines the attainable region which represents the limits of achievability by the system 3 results and discussion in this section data from a real experiment is utilized to illustrate the theories presented in the previous sections the case study is based on a batch methane bioreactor operated with diary manure where experimental measurements of volatile fatty acids and methane gas flowrate which can be used to get the concentration of methanogenic archae were obtained zaher et al 2009 3 1 parameter identifiability measures 3 1 1 sensitivity analysis in this section the objective was to determine which set of parameters should be estimated to accurately describe the mechanisms of the anaerobic digestion process this depends on analyzing the sensitivity function of the model parameters with respect to with respect to the states fig 4 presents the sensitivity functions dynamic sensitivities of the states for the parameters of the biokinetic model from the shape of the sensitivity functions the authors made the following remarks 1 all the states show some sensitivity to the model parameters which can either be a negative or positive sensitivity 2 the anaerobic microorganisms mostly show negative sensitivity while the substrates show both negative and positive sensitivities to the model parameters table 1 presents the numerical characteristics sensitivity analysis which include the nominal values and scale of the model parameters the mean minimum and maximum values of the dynamic sensitivities the sensitivity measures l1 and l2 as well as the number of data points n the 130 data points corresponds to the small time step of 0 0769 that was used to integrate the sensitivity equations from 0 to 10days particularly it is worth mentioning that for the substrates the biodegradable volatile solids is most sensitive to the acid yield coefficient k 2 while volatile fatty acids are most sensitivity to the monod saturation constant for volatile acids k s 2 and inhibition constant k i for the anaerobic microorganisms the acidogenic bacteria is highly sensitive to the monod saturation constant k s 2 while the methanogenic archae are highly sensitive to inhibition constant k i these outcome accurately describe the underlying theories of the anaerobic treatment process which include breakdown of volatile solids into volatile fatty acids by acidogenic bacteria utilization of volatile fatty acids for growth of methanogenic archaea as well as high sensitivity of methanogenic archaea to inhibitions henze et al 2008 wang et al 2007 hence the results clearly illustrate the ability of the model to describe the anaerobic digestion process fig 5 presents the use of the sensitivity measure sum of sensitivity functions of the available measurements with respect to parameters to rank the model parameters which reveals the relative significance of the parameters with respect to the observable states only the relative ranking for volatile acids methanogenic archaea as well as volatile acids methanogenic archae as model as model outputs are considered this is because the experimental data which is used as our case study only contains measurements for volatile acids methanogenic archae calculated form methane flowrate and we therefore determine the set of model parameters that are identifiable considering these two observable states it is noteworthy that the yield coefficient k 1 is found completely not sensitive to any of the observable states the inhibition constant k i was found most significant for all the observable states followed by the yield coefficient k 3 the monod constants k s 1 and k s 2 and the yield coefficient k 2 were found significant albeit to a relatively lower degree the practical relevance of the parameter significance ranking is that only those parameters with significant sensitivity measure with respect to the observable states can be identified therefore considering volatile fatty acids and methanogenic archaea as the only observable states in the system the yield coefficient k 1 cannot be identified from the available data since it has a sensitivity measure of zero this implies only 5 out of the 6 model parameters can be candidates for parameter estimation 3 1 2 collinearity analysis this section of the identifiability analysis only considers those set of parameters 5 out of the 6 model parameters were significant which have a significant effect on the observable states the collinearity analysis screens all possible subsets of the potential candidate parameters to determine the identifiable subsets using a collinearity index the five potential candidates for parameter estimation gives a total of approximately 31 parameter subset combinations with a maximum subset size of five parameters fig 6 a presents the collinearity analysis for all possible combinations of parameter subsets while fig 6b presents collinearity analysis for the potentially identifiable subsets from fig 6 it can be observed that of the 31 possible subset combinations only 18 are potentially identifiable those having collinearity index less than 15 and with a maximum identifiable subset size of three parameters these findings suggest that for a given set of observable states experimental measurements there exist many identifiable subset combinations of model parameters having a maximum number of parameters that can be estimated uniquely unique estimation means that by using an identifiable subset the estimated parameters should have a relatively lower correlation values and or confidence intervals the results corroborate the theoretical premise that subjecting an overparameterized model to limited quality quantity of data limits the number of parameter that can be estimated to uniquely and accurately describe the system brun et al 2002 sin and vanrolleghem 2007 3 2 model fits and parameter uncertainty two cases of parameter estimation were considered one with an identifiable subset specifically k 2 k s 2 and k i and one with all the model parameters known as the nominal case so that the effect of identifiability analysis can be ascertained the model fits for both cases are presented in fig 7 while parameter estimates together with their 95 marginal confidence intervals are shown in table 2 visually both cases show a good fit between the experimental measurements and model predictions with no observable difference in both cases however from a numerical perspective see table 2 the parameter estimates from the nominal case shows a much higher degree of uncertainty given as the standard deviation which relates to the 95 marginal confidence interval than that of the identifiable case put it in another way the identifiability analysis has served to reduce the degree of uncertainty in model parameter estimates the results indicate that despite variation in parameter uncertainty the quality of the model fit to experimental data is not compromised and using an identifiable subset of model parameters serves to improve the quality of the model parameters it is worth mentioning that the identifiable parameter subset utilized for parameter estimation is just one of the three identifiable subsets available with size of 3 other three parameter combinations of identifiable subsets can still be selected as candidates for the parameter estimation the focus of this study is not to consider all the identifiable subset but to illustrate how these identifiability issues should be incorporated in digester synthesis 3 3 uncertainty quantification on model states recall from step 3 of section 2 which stated the need to quantify the model prediction state uncertainty using the unidentifiable parameter set as inputs from section 3 2 we have demonstrated the use of an identifiable parameter subset k 2 k s 2 and k i to reduce uncertainty in model parameters even though the use of an identifiable subset reduces parameter uncertainty it causes another problem which is that of model uncertainty this is because those parameters that are not identifiable k 1 k 2 and k s 1 need to be kept constant probably using values estimated from previous studies or independent experiments which influences the reliability of the model since the geometric optimization technique of attainable regions presented in this study for synthesis of anaerobic digesters is unique for a given kinetic model an unreliable model will therefore result in an unreliable digester system which can easily lead to operational failure hence before using the model to construct the attainable regions which can be interpreted into digester structures we quantify and incorporate the model prediction uncertainty into the limits of achievability of the system which is defined by the attainable regions fig 8 presents the results obtained from the monte carlo simulations from a general perspective the results indicate that each of the model states have a time varying uncertainty band defined by the 10th and the 90th percentile the methanogenic archaea shows insignificant uncertainty band to the model inputs at certain times instants where the mean 10th and 90th percentile are equal the width of the band difference between the 10th and the 90th percentile describes the spread of the distribution of the model states resulting from parameter uncertainty and the larger the width the higher the degree of model output uncertainty this is often called mapping propagating parameter input uncertainty onto states output uncertainty the state uncertainty bands presented in fig 8 are highly dependent on the uncertainty range of the model parameters the study used the joint confidence region fig 9 of the sampled parameters which takes into consideration the correlation amongst model parameters and eliminates the need to define the correlation amongst model parameters during the monte carlo procedure the interpretation of these results is based on the relationship between uncertainty band and model quality the higher the uncertainty band the lower the model quality hence model predictions for biodegradable volatile solids followed by volatile fatty acids and acidogenic bacteria are deemed of low quality large uncertainty bands while that of methanogenic archaea can be deemed acceptable 3 4 self optimizing attainable regions surely whether of acceptable quality or not the prediction uncertainty around the model states affects the limits of achievability of the anaerobic digestion process and hence the nature of the optimal digester structures this is because for synthesis of methane bioreactors using attainable region analysis the predicted performance target or limits of achievability by the system is computed by the area of the convex hull for the set of states outputs achievable by the system hence when using attainable regions for performance targeting and digester network synthesis we suggest that it should be mandatory to incorporate uncertainty of model prediction during construction of the attainable regions the approach here relies on constructing the attainable regions using the three key points of the state s prediction mean 10th and 90th percentile and superposing the regions to obtain a robust region which considers the effect of uncertainty fig 10 presents the ar for the 10th percentile mean and 90th percentile state predictions on to which the digester structures required to attain points on the ar boundary has been overlaid a detailed explanation of how the ar boundary has been interpreted into digester structures is presented in our recent publication abunde neba et al 2019c it can be observed that for all the cases where the ar boundary is convex the optimal digester structure involves a plug flow digester in order to attain points on the ar boundary this can be explained by the intrinsic geometric characteristics of this type of reactor in relation to the properties of the ar boundary the ar boundary is composed entirely of reaction and mixing surfaces only reaction surfaces are always convex and the points that form convex sections of the ar boundary arise specifically from points on pfr trajectories ming et al 2016 this is so because governing equations of a pfr is a system of first order ordinary differential equations eq 17 where a phase plane presentation of the solution of the system for a given organic load and digestion time is called pfr trajectory geometrically the rate vector evaluated at points on the pfr trajectory is tangent to all points on the trajectory hildebrandt and glasser 1990 ming et al 2016 this implies the boundary of a true ar will always contain points originating from pfr trajectory otherwise it becomes a candidate ar fig 10d present the intersection of the three regions to define the self optimizing attainable region it can be observed that the region looks smaller than any of the three individual regions 10th percentile mean and 90th percentile this illustrates the accept loss in process operation mentioned in section 1 it is necessary here to re clarify exactly what is meant by self optimizing attainable regions unlike the attainable region which represents the set of all possible states that is attainable by the system for a defined kinetics and initial condition feed point the self optimizing attainable region represents the set of all possible states attainable by the system even in cases of kinetic uncertainty the size of the self optimizing attainable region is related to the domain of uncertainty defined for the unidentifiable set of model parameters used for the uncertainty propagation the presence of uncertainty reduces the size of the self optimizing ar and if the domain of uncertainty is reduced the size increases as mentioned in section 1 the attainable region defines the limits of achievability performance targets by a system this implies that considering uncertainty has greatly reduced the limits of achievability by the system even though we have benefited from increased robustness the authors will also like to clarify at this point that by performance targets the authors refer to the totality concentration of microorganisms and substrates that can be output by the different digester combinations using the fundamental processes occurring in the system this is defined by the attainable region of the system for a given kinetics and by the self optimizing attainable region for different kinetic variations within a defined domain the findings from this study are therefore highly important in making economic feasibility decisions about the performance of biogas plants especially in cases where accuracy is very necessary put it in another way when assessing the economic feasibility of the anaerobic treatment process one can now consider the economic performance of the process even in cases of uncertainty and reliably compare it with other process alternatives in summary coupling uncertainty analysis and attainable region theory provides a systematic methodological framework for dealing with kinetic uncertainty during design of biogas digesters and hence allows biogas engineers to benefit from the advantages of model based design these advantages include easy digester scale up less experimental runs hence less cost as well as obtain optimal design parameters and digester configurations this approach is therefore recommended as a reliable strategy for design of biogas plants in cases of kinetic uncertainty which is very common with biokinetic models for anaerobic digestion 4 conclusion a systematic model based framework for the synthesis of biogas reactors under cases of kinetic uncertainty has been developed using the case of the modified hill model for anaerobic digestion the following conclusions are made identifiability analysis reveals that only 5 out of the 6 model parameters can be candidates for parameter estimation the 5 potential candidates for parameter estimation gives a total of approximately 31 parameter subset combinations with a maximum subset size of 5 of the 31 possible subset combinations only 18 are potentially identifiable and with a maximum identifiable subset size of 3 parameter estimation indicates that despite variation in parameter uncertainty the quality of the model fit to experimental data is not compromised and using an identifiable subset of model parameters serves reduce the degree of uncertainty confidence interval in model parameter estimates following sensitivity analysis the biodegradable volatile solids are most sensitive to the acid yield coefficient k 2 while volatile fatty acids are most sensitivity to the monod saturation constant for volatile acids k s 2 and inhibition constant k i for the anaerobic microorganisms the acidogenic bacteria is highly sensitive to the monod saturation constant k s 2 while the methanogenic archae are highly sensitive to inhibition constant k i uncertainty quantification reveals that of the four model states the methanogenic archaea shows an insignificant uncertainty band to the model inputs at certain times instants while all the other sates show a degree of significant uncertainty to the model inputs at all times instants the systematic model based framework proposed in this study has been based on the concept of attainable regions hence when using attainable regions for performance targeting and digester network synthesis we suggest that it should be mandatory to incorporate uncertainty of model prediction during construction of the attainable regions the attainable region obtained in such cases is referred to as a self optimizing attainable region which is generally smaller than the attainable region it is concluded that incorporating kinetic uncertainty onto attainable regions has greatly reduces the limits of achievability by the system even though we have benefited from increased robustness when the ar is obtained the boundary of the ar can be interpreted into digester structures whereby the optimal digester structure always involves a plug flow digester in combination with either a cstr and or bypass streams in summary coupling identifiability analysis uncertainty quantification and the attainable region theory provides a systematic methodological framework for defining the performance targets of the anaerobic treatment process under conditions of uncertainty it is also worth mentioning that even though the study is based on the anaerobic treatment process the framework can be applied to optimally design other environmental chemical processes which can be described with a kinetic model more research is needed to extend the concept of self optimizing attainable regions in the field of anaerobic digestion this study has focused on kinetic uncertainty and it would be interesting to assess the effects of other potential sources of uncertainty such as substrate characteristics presence of inhibitions or temperature variations on the performance targets

18178,controlled release materials crms are emerging oxidant delivery techniques for in situ chemical oxidation isco for groundwater remediation successful implementation of crm relies on good understandings of the kinetics and mechanism of controlled release of reactive agents in this study batch experiments and model simulations were conducted to explore the impacts of crm properties composition and size and environmental conditions temperature ph water volume and anions on kmno4 release from kmno4 paraffin controlled release beads experimental results indicated that higher kmno4 paraffin mass ratio resulted in shorter release longevities and higher release rate larger bead resulted in lower release rate longer release longevity and more kmno4 released higher incubation temperature resulted in higher release rate and shorter release longevity but did not affect the total mass of kmno4 released acidic ph decreased the total mass of kmno4 released while alkaline ph did not affect kmno4 release the presence of so4 2 co3 2 cl and br had negligible impacts on kmno4 release a dissolution diffusion conceptual model was developed the above experimental observation and the associated controlled release mechanisms can be qualitatively explained by the conceptual model a more detailed two film boundary mathematical model was developed to simulate kmno4 release process comparison of modeling results with experimental data suggest that the new mathematical model gave a good quantitatively predication overall this study shows that properly designed crm can sustain release for years thus representing a cost effective and low maintenance groundwater remediation technology both crm properties and environmental conditions significantly affect the release kinetics and longevity therefore these factors should be considered in the design and maintenance of crm based isco system keywords controlled release slow release soil remediation contaminated site aquifer in situ remediation 1 introduction in situ chemical oxidation isco is a widely used groundwater remediation technology lee et al 2014 liu et al 2014 tsitonaki et al 2010 isco involves the introduction of chemical oxidants into the aquifer to react with contaminants and convert them into less harmful products liu et al 2014 2016 conventional isco techniques have several limitations such as back diffusion liu and ball 2002 tailing zhang and brusseau 1999 and rebound de barros et al 2013 o connor et al 2018b which deteriorate its long term effectiveness for pollutant removal in order to overcome these challenges a novel technology named controlled release materials crms has been developed in recent years kang et al 2004 ross et al 2005 crms combine reactive reagents with binding agents and or buffering reagents which achieves long term sustained release of reactants without the need for continuous dosing common ways of preparing crms include mixing and setting in mold liang et al 2011b 2014 freezing thaw lin et al 2012 heating wax and cooling christenson et al 2012 liang and chen 2017 in situ chelation lee and gupta 2014 yang et al 2016 and encapsulation by oil separation yuan et al 2012 crm technologies have several advantages 1 delivering oxidants in a controlled and sustained way 2 degrading pollutants over prolonged periods of time months years rather than days weeks christenson et al 2016 3 low maintenance and low cost rauscher et al 2012b 4 reducing the nonproductive consumption of oxidants yuan et al 2012 commonly used isco crm reagents include persulfate and permanganate o connor et al 2018a studies have showed that isco crms are capable of completely degrading a variety of organic pollutants christenson et al 2012 2016 kambhu et al 2012 2017 liang et al 2014 rauscher et al 2012a yuan et al 2012 2013 release kinetics of crm directly determines how long the crm is able to sustain reactant release and whether a sufficient amount of reactive reagents can be released which is critical for the performance of crm application however the majority of previous researches focused primarily on pollutant removal kinetics by crm rather than the release kinetics of active agents christenson et al 2016 liang et al 2011a rauscher et al 2012a a few studies explored the release kinetics of active agents but these studies used the observed data as supporting evidence for pollutant degradation christenson et al 2012 lee and schwartz 2007 liang and chen 2017 liang et al 2011a 2014 xiong et al 2016 no peer review paper focuses on the controlled release kinetics and the underlining mechanisms for the controlled release the physicochemical properties of crm e g composition and size directly affect its release kinetics however no peer review paper has systematically explored how physicochemical properties of crm affect the release kinetics environmental conditions e g temperature ph and anions may also affect the crm release process xiong et al conducted fractional factorial design experiments with nine parallel tests to investigate the impacts of ph dissolved oxygen do and temperatures on the release kinetics of kmno4 wax granules xiong et al 2016 their preliminary data suggested that temperature and ph had greater influence on the kmno4 release than do xiong et al 2016 although fractional factorial design makes experiments cheaper and faster to run it may obfuscate interactions between factors therefore a more systematical and better designed study is needed mathematical models are important tools for fundamental understanding design and optimization of isco remediation system huling and pivetz 2006 there are two categories of mathematical models empirical models and theoretical models empirical models are developed using a regression analysis of field observations or experimental data theoretical models are developed based on the basic transport and reaction mechanisms most of current models that describe the slow release process of crm are all empirical models which simply fitting measured data from bench scale release experiments with regression models such as first order kinetics schwartz et al 1968 exponential kinetics kang et al 2004 yuan et al 2013 and hyperbola model al zahrani 2000 although these simple empirical models help to understand the observed data they are too simple to understand the release mechanisms more powerful theoretical models that consider the transport mechanisms would definitely help to improve current understanding on the controlled release mechanisms in this study the impacts of crm physicochemical properties composition and size and environmental conditions temperature ph water volume and anions on the release kinetics of kmno4 paraffin beads were investigated based on experimental results a preliminary conceptual model and a more detailed two film boundary dissolution diffusion mathematical model were developed to describe the controlled release process model prediction results were compared with experimental measurement data to test its reliability 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials potassium permanganate kmno4 ar

from tong guang fine chemicals company guangan china sulfuric acid h2so4 99 was purchased from beijing chemical works beijing china all solutions were prepared using ultrapure water 18 2 mω cm from a bench ultrapure water system master ruv hitech instruments china 2 2 preparation of kmno4 controlled release beads the kmno4 controlled release beads crbs were prepared by the hot melt encapsulation method solid paraffin wax was melted to 70 c in a water bath and then kmno4 was added and stirred well using glass rod the paraffin kmno4 mixture was then poured into a stainless bead mold at room temperature the bead mold was consisted of two symmetrical hemispherical molds the paraffin kmno4 bead was pushed from the mold after cooling the mass of paraffin kmno4 beads were weighed and recorded to calculate the average mass the bead with a mass deviation greater than 3 were discarded the properties of the kmno4 crb with kmno4 paraffin mass ratio of 4 1 5 1 and 6 1 were showed in table 1 2 3 batch release experiment batch experiments were conducted in triplicate in glass vials each vial contained one crb and 100 ml water the vials were incubated in a constant temperature incubator hzq f160 suzhou peiying china most experiments were conducted using 1 cm crb with kmno4 paraffin mass ratio of 5 1 at 15 c the specific condition in each batch experiment was described as follows to explore the impact of kmno4 paraffin mass ratio release experiments were conducted for crb with kmno4 paraffin mass ratio of 4 1 5 1 and 6 1 to explore the impact of bead size release experiments were conducted for crbs with diameters of 1 cm and 2 cm the mno4 paraffin mass ratio in this experiment was 6 1 to explore the impact of temperature release experiments were conducted at 4 15 30 40 and 50 c to explore the impact of solution ph release experiments were conducted at ph of 3 0 4 0 10 0 11 0 and 12 0 crbs with kmno4 paraffin mass ratio of 5 1 were used for experiments of ph 2 3 4 and 7 crb with kmno4 paraffin mass ratio of 6 1 were used for experiments of ph 7 10 11 and 12 to explore the impact of water volume release experiments were conducted in reactor containing 50 100 200 and 300 ml of water to explore the impact of anions experiments were conducted in reactors containing 10 mm of nacl nabr na2co3 and na2so4 2 4 analysis the kmno4 concentration was analyzed using a uv visible spectrophotometer cary 60 agilent usa by measuring the absorption at 525 nm wavelength at each sampling time 100 μl solution was collected and diluted 200 times before kmno4 concentration measurement the morphology and pore structures of crb before and after the release experiment were characterized using a fei quanta 250 environmental scanning electron microscope esem thermofisher usa 3 results and discussion 3 1 conceptual model of kmno4 controlled release kmno4 release patterns in all batch experiments had similar biphasic trends which were characterized by an initial rapid release followed by a slow and sustained release later fig 1 we proposed a conceptual model to explain the biphasic trends kmno4 release from control release bead crb is a dissolution diffusion process fig 2 the initial fast release was due to rapid dissolution of kmno4 particles embedded on the surface of the crb which were readily assessible to bulk water fig 3 a dissolution of kmno4 particles left empty crevices or pores which generated inter bead openings and channels within the bead matrix the empty crevices formed after kmno4 dissolution were verified by environmental scanning electron microscope fig 3b as a result water penetrated into the bead matrix and contacted with the remaining kmno4 inside once contacted with penetrating water kmno4 inside the bead dissolved and diffused through pore water to reach the bulk water outside the bead the bead matrix containing kmno4 is named kmno4 undissolved zone and the bead matrix with pore space occupied by penetrating water is named kmno4 dissolved zone fig 2 the interface between kmno4 undissolved zone and kmno4 dissolved zone is named dissolution front kmno4 dissolution occurred on the dissolution front since aqueous phase diffusion in the pore water is relatively slow kmno4 release rate gradually decreased as the dissolution front moved from the bead surface into the bead core this step is the key mechanism for the controlled and sustained release of crb based on this conceptual model a detailed mathematical model was further developed in section 3 4 3 2 key parameters describing kmno4 release kinetics four parameters including release longevity release rate total kmno4 mass released and release efficiency are used in the following text to illustrate the kmno4 release kinetics release longevity t longevity day is defined as how long crbs can sustain kmno4 release which can be described by the time for the dissolved kmno4 concentration to reach a plateau level in fig 1 total kmno4 mass released from the bead m mg is defined as the cumulative mass of kmno4 released at time t longevity release rate r mg day g bead is defined as the quantity of kmno4 released per unit time and the total mass of crb which can be calculated by equation 1 m crb is the total mass of crb release efficiency is defined as the proportion of the released kmno4 mass to the total kmno4 mass in the crb which can be calculated by multiplying m crb by the ratio of kmno4 in crb 1 r m t l o n g e v i t y m c r b 3 3 impacts of crb properties and environmental conditions on kmno4 release kinetics 3 3 1 kmno4 paraffin mass ratio of crb higher kmno4 paraffin mass ratio resulted in shorter release longevities and higher release rate the release longevity of crbs with kmno4 paraffin ratio of 6 1 5 1 and 4 1 were 9 23 37 days respectively fig 1a and table s1 kang et al reported similar phenomenon for paraffin kmno4 pellet kang et al 2004 they found that the theoretical release longevity of the pellets with kmno4 paraffin mass ratios of 1 1 1 2 and 1 5 were 1 6 months 19 3 years and 472 years respectively kang et al 2004 higher kmno4 paraffin mass ratios also resulted in faster release rate table s1 hydrophobic paraffin hinder water penetration into the pore space of bead matrix thus slowing down the kmno4 dissolution rate and release rate liang and chen 2017 therefore crbs with higher kmno4 paraffin mass ratio had lower release rate and longer release longevity more sustained release almost 100 kmno4 encapsulated in the crb were finally released into the water for kmno4 paraffin ratio of 4 1 5 1 and 6 1 initial kmno4 mass were 832 mg 796 mg and 728 mg respectively and 100 1 100 2 and 99 of the initial kmno4 mass were finally released table s1 this shows that our crb has a very high release efficiency and almost all kmno4 can release and used for contaminant oxidation in contrast liang et al reported a much lower release efficiency for crms they made liang et al 2014 their crm contained kmno4 polycaprolactone and starch 63 8 after 76 days of release 3 3 2 size of crb larger bead resulted in lower release rate longer release longevity and more kmno4 released the kmno4 release rate of 1 cm bead was 5 times higher than that of 2 cm bead fig 1b and table s2 the release longevity of 2 cm bead was 4 5 times longer than that of 1 cm bead similar results have been reported for persulfate paraffin candles kambhu et al found that the persulfate release rate of 0 71 and 1 27 cm candles were 97 mg day g candle and 30 mg day g candle and the corresponding release longevity were 6 and 25 days respectively kambhu et al 2012 larger beads had smaller specific surface area i e mass transfer interface area which led to lower release rate larger beads contained more kmno4 thus resulting in more kmno4 released the total mass of kmno4 released from 2 cm beads was 8 times of that of 1 cm beads table s2 similar phenomenon was reported by sakulthaew et al sakulthaew and chokejaroenrat 2016 they explored the impact of the size of control release candle 1 28 0 64 0 32 cm in length and found 1 28 cm candle released the maximum amount of kmno4 sakulthaew and chokejaroenrat 2016 since larger beads contained more kmno4 but have lower release rate their release longevities were much longer the release efficiency of both 1 cm and 2 cm crb were all closed to 100 table s2 3 3 3 temperature higher incubation temperature resulted in higher release rate and shorter release longevity as the temperature increased from 4 to 50 c the kmno4 release rate increased from 12 6 mg day g bead to 283 1 mg day g bead and the kmno4 release longevity decreased from 60 to 3 days fig 1c and table s3 high temperature accelerated the molecular thermodynamic motion both dissolution and diffusion of kmno4 were promoted by high temperature therefore the overall kmno4 release rate increased with temperature xiong et al also found that temperature significantly increased the release rate of kmno4 granules xiong et al 2016 temperature did not affect the total mass of kmno4 released nearly of 100 of the kmno4 was released from the beads at temperatures from 4 to 50 c table s3 3 3 4 solution ph acidic ph reduced the total amount of kmno4 that can be released while alkaline ph did not affect kmno4 release kmno4 release experiments were conducted under ph 2 3 4 7 control 10 11 and 12 note that crbs with kmno4 paraffin mass ratio of 5 1 were used for experiments of ph 2 3 and 4 but crbs with kmno4 paraffin mass ratio of 6 1 were used for experiments of ph 10 11 and 12 the treatment of ph 2 3 and 4 had significantly lower total amount of kmno4 released while the treatment of ph 10 11 and 12 released almost 100 of kmno4 fig 1d and e and table s4 crbs incubated at ph 2 only release 58 5 of kmno4 xiong et al found that the kmno4 release efficiency of kmno4 wax granules increased as the solution ph increased from 6 to 8 xiong et al 2016 kmno4 can spontaneously decompose into mno2 and o2 reaction 1 seol et al 2003 this reaction is very slow at neutral and alkaline ph but is accelerated by h reaction 2 xiong et al 2016 at ph 2 4 acidic ph promoted kmno4 decomposition and produced mno2 the produced mno2 plug the pores inside the bead seol et al 2003 west et al 2008 and reduced the bead permeability li and schwartz 2004a b this reduced the kmno4 release rate and decreased the total amount of kmno4 that can be released although we did not measure the production of mno2 and o2 increasing ph level during batch release experiment provided an indirect evidence for the occurrence of reaction 2 at ph 2 4 table s4 1a 4 m n o 4 2 h 2 o 4 m n o 2 3 o 2 4 o h 2a 4 m n o 4 4 h 4 m n o 2 3 o 2 2 h 2 o 3 3 5 water volume in reactors kmno4 release kinetics were monitored for the same crbs that were incubated in the reactors with different volume of water the total amount of kmno4 released from the same crbs was independent of the volume of water in the reactors containing 50 100 200 and 300 ml of water 786 798 763 and 790 mg of kmno4 were finally released and the corresponding kmno4 release efficiency were 98 8 100 2 95 8 and 99 2 fig 1f and table s5 indicating that the crbs kept high release efficiency in different volume of water the kmno4 release rate and release longevity were independent of the volume of water for the reactors containing 50 300 ml of water the release rate was 33 3 36 4 mg day g bead and the release longevity was 23 24 days liang and chen conducted the flow through experiments to monitor the persulfate release kinetics from sustained release rods with different water flushing rate and found that the release longevity were similar and were not affected by flushing rate liang and chen 2017 3 3 6 water matrix anions the presence of so4 2 co3 2 cl and br had negligible impacts on kmno4 release the release plots of the treatments containing 10 mm of so4 2 co3 2 cl and br overlapped with the plot of the no anion control fig 1g the total mass of kmno4 released and the release efficiency in the presence of so4 2 co3 2 cl and br were very close to the control table s6 to our best knowledge the impacts of water chemistry on crm release kinetics have never been investigated our results suggest that common water matrix anions play negligible roles in determining the releases characteristics of crm 3 4 mathematical model that simulate kmno4 controlled release 3 4 1 model development based on the conceptual mode presented in section 3 1 and the experimental results presented in section 3 3 a detailed two film boundary dissolution diffusion mathematical model was developed this model was based on the following assumptions 1 dissolution of kmno4 occurs only at the interface between the dissolved zone and undissolved zone i e on the dissolution front 2 the aqueous concentration of kmno4 on the dissolution front is its solubility 3 once kmno4 reached bulk water outside crb it immediately distributed evenly in the entire bulk water 4 kmno4 decomposition reactions reaction 1 and 2 are not considered table 2 lists all symbols used in the mathematical model kmno4 release from crb was a dissolution diffusion process thus the kmno4 mass release rate dm dt kg s can be calculated by fick s law equation 2 2 d m s d t d e d c d r 3 s 4 π r 2 c substitute equation 3 into equation

data cumulative mass of kmno4 released m presented in fig 1 can be incorporated into equation 12 to calculate the radius of the undissolved zone r in crb the calculated r and the corresponding release time t are then incorporated into equation 18 to calculate the effective diffusion coefficient de the de values calculated based on data of fig 1 were plotted against the radius of the undissolved zone r fig s1 as fig s1 shows crb composition and temperature significantly changed the value of de but bead size has relatively small impacts interestingly the relationship between de and temperature well satisfied the arrhenius formula which provided the basis to predict the kmno4 release kinetics at different temperatures table s7 and fig s2 diffusion is a temperature dependent process engel and reid 2012 higher temperature often results in higher diffusion rate since diffusion is the result of random movements of particles that move particles from areas of high concentration to areas of lower concentration as temperature increases particle movement rates increase thus resulting in faster diffusion engel and reid 2012 many studies have showed that the diffusion coefficient of various compounds in water solution showed arrhenius type behaviors thus corroborating our results bonoli and witherspoon 1968 poudyal and adhikari 2014 rossi et al 2015 sharma and adhikari 2014 witherspoon and saraf 1965 18 m 4 3 π a r 0 3 r 3 fig 4 show the predicted kmno4 concentration released by our model and the concentration measured under different scenarios kmno4 paraffin mass ratio bead size temperature water volume in reactors the modeling results are very close to the measured data verifying the reliability of our model details on model simulation process can be found in text s1 of the supplementary material 3 4 3 more scenarios predicted by model the model was used to predict kmno4 release process under different conditions e g kmno4 paraffin mass ratio bead diameter and temperature details on model simulation process can be found in text s1 of the supplementary material fig 5 shows that model simulation results were consistent with the batch experimental results corroborating that 1 higher kmno4 paraffin mass ratio resulted in shorter release longevities and higher release rate 2 larger bead resulted in lower release rate longer release longevity and more kmno4 released 3 higher incubation temperature resulted in higher release rate and shorter release longevity but the total mass of kmno4 released and the release efficiency kept the same our model did not consider chemical reactions so influence of solution ph and water matrix anions can not be modeled since release longevity is a key design parameter for crm based isco remedial system we simulated the kmno4 release longevity under different scenarios bead diameter ranging from 1 cm to 7 cm and temperature at 4 c 15 c and 30 c fig 6 suggests that release longevity significantly increases with increasing bead size the bead with diameters of 7 cm could keep releasing for several years which is corroborated by a five year monitoring field study christenson et al 2016 christenson et al kmno4 candles with the length of 91 4 cm long and diameter of 5 1 cm or 7 6 cm still maintain an inner undissolved core after five years of release groundwater temperature is another critical parameter that greatly influenced the release longevity this should be considered when design crm based isco system for contaminated sites located in different climate zone although our mathematical model has several limitations fig 5 can be used as references by practitioners and engineers for technology selection design and maintenance persulfate is another commonly used controlled release isco oxidant similar to kmno4 persufalte is also an inorganic salt thus the controlled release process of persulfate based crm may also follow the dissolution diffusion conceptual model and the mathematical model developed for kmno4 may also be applicable to persulfate further release experiments are needed to test the applicability of the mathematical model to descript persulfate sustained release 4 conclusions successful implementation of controlled release materials crm technology relies on good understandings of kinetics and mechanism of controlled release of reactive agents in this study the kmno4 paraffin controlled release beads crbs with near 100 release efficiency were constructed batch experiments show that both crm properties size and composition and environmental conditions temperature ph water volume and anions significantly affect the release kinetics these factors should be considered in the design and maintenance of crm based isco system a dissolution diffusion conceptual model was developed to qualitatively explain the experimental data as well as the associated controlled release mechanisms based on these results a more detailed two film boundary mathematical model was established comparison of modeling results with experimental data suggest that the new mathematical model can give good quantitative predications our results suggest that properly designed crm can sustain reagent release for years without replenishments therefore crm represents a cost effective and low maintenance technology that can provide a long term solution for

temperature resulted in higher release rate and shorter release longevity but did not affect the total mass of kmno4 released acidic ph decreased the total mass of kmno4 released while alkaline ph did not affect kmno4 release the presence of so4 2 co3 2 cl and br had negligible impacts on kmno4 release a dissolution diffusion conceptual model was developed the above experimental observation and the associated controlled release mechanisms can be qualitatively explained by the conceptual model a more detailed two film boundary mathematical model was developed to simulate kmno4 release process comparison of modeling results with experimental data suggest that the new mathematical model gave a good quantitatively predication overall this study shows that properly designed crm can sustain release for years thus representing a cost effective and low maintenance groundwater remediation technology both crm properties and environmental conditions significantly affect the release kinetics and longevity therefore these factors should be considered in the design and maintenance of crm based isco system keywords controlled release slow release soil remediation contaminated site aquifer in situ remediation 1 introduction in situ chemical oxidation isco is a widely used groundwater remediation technology lee et al 2014 liu et al 2014 tsitonaki et al 2010 isco involves the introduction of chemical oxidants into the aquifer to react with contaminants and convert them into less harmful products liu et al 2014 2016 conventional isco techniques have several limitations such as back diffusion liu and ball 2002 tailing zhang and brusseau 1999 and rebound de barros et al 2013 o connor et al 2018b which deteriorate its long term effectiveness for pollutant removal in order to overcome these challenges a novel technology named controlled release materials crms has been developed in recent years kang et al 2004 ross et al 2005 crms combine reactive reagents with binding agents and or buffering reagents which achieves long term sustained release of reactants without the need for continuous dosing common ways of preparing crms include mixing and setting in mold liang et al 2011b 2014 freezing thaw lin et al 2012 heating wax and cooling christenson et al 2012 liang and chen 2017 in situ chelation lee and gupta 2014 yang et al 2016 and encapsulation by oil separation yuan et al 2012 crm technologies have several advantages 1 delivering oxidants in a controlled and sustained way 2 degrading pollutants over prolonged periods of time months years rather than days weeks christenson et al 2016 3 low maintenance and low cost rauscher et al 2012b 4 reducing the nonproductive consumption of oxidants yuan et al 2012 commonly used isco crm reagents include persulfate and permanganate o connor et al 2018a studies have showed that isco crms are capable of completely degrading a variety of organic pollutants christenson et al 2012 2016 kambhu et al 2012 2017 liang et al 2014 rauscher et al 2012a yuan et al 2012 2013 release kinetics of crm directly determines how long the crm is able to sustain reactant release and whether a sufficient amount of reactive reagents can be released which is critical for the performance of crm application however the majority of previous researches focused primarily on pollutant removal kinetics by crm rather than the release kinetics of active agents christenson et al 2016 liang et al 2011a rauscher et al 2012a a few studies explored the release kinetics of active agents but these studies used the observed data as supporting evidence for pollutant degradation christenson et al 2012 lee and schwartz 2007 liang and chen 2017 liang et al 2011a 2014 xiong et al 2016 no peer review paper focuses on the controlled release kinetics and the underlining mechanisms for the controlled release the physicochemical properties of crm e g composition and size directly affect its release kinetics however no peer review paper has systematically explored how physicochemical properties of crm affect the release kinetics environmental conditions e g temperature ph and anions may also affect the crm release process xiong et al conducted fractional factorial design experiments with nine parallel tests to investigate the impacts of ph dissolved oxygen do and temperatures on the release kinetics of kmno4 wax granules xiong et al 2016 their preliminary data suggested that temperature and ph had greater influence on the kmno4 release than do xiong et al 2016 although fractional factorial design makes experiments cheaper and faster to run it may obfuscate interactions between factors therefore a more systematical and better designed study is needed mathematical models are important tools for fundamental understanding design and optimization of isco remediation system huling and pivetz 2006 there are two categories of mathematical models empirical models and theoretical models empirical models are developed using a regression analysis of field observations or experimental data theoretical models are developed based on the basic transport and reaction mechanisms most of current models that describe the slow release process of crm are all empirical models which simply fitting measured data from bench scale release experiments with regression models such as first order kinetics schwartz et al 1968 exponential kinetics kang et al 2004 yuan et al 2013 and hyperbola model al zahrani 2000 although these simple empirical models help to understand the observed data they are too simple to understand the release mechanisms more powerful theoretical models that consider the transport mechanisms would definitely help to improve current understanding on the controlled release mechanisms in this study the impacts of crm physicochemical properties composition and size and environmental conditions temperature ph water volume and anions on the release kinetics of kmno4 paraffin beads were investigated based on experimental results a preliminary conceptual model and a more detailed two film boundary dissolution diffusion mathematical model were developed to describe the controlled release process model prediction results were compared with experimental measurement data to test its reliability 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials potassium permanganate kmno4 ar

bench ultrapure water system master ruv hitech instruments china 2 2 preparation of kmno4 controlled release beads the kmno4 controlled release beads crbs were prepared by the hot melt encapsulation method solid paraffin wax was melted to 70 c in a water bath and then kmno4 was added and stirred well using glass rod the paraffin kmno4 mixture was then poured into a stainless bead mold at room temperature the bead mold was consisted of two symmetrical hemispherical molds the paraffin kmno4 bead was pushed from the mold after cooling the mass of paraffin kmno4 beads were weighed and recorded to calculate the average mass the bead with a mass deviation greater than 3 were discarded the properties of the kmno4 crb with kmno4 paraffin mass ratio of 4 1 5 1 and 6 1 were showed in table 1 2 3 batch release experiment batch experiments were conducted in triplicate in glass vials each vial contained one crb and 100 ml water the vials were incubated in a constant temperature incubator hzq f160 suzhou peiying china most experiments were conducted using 1 cm crb with kmno4 paraffin mass ratio of 5 1 at 15 c the specific condition in each batch experiment was described as follows to explore the impact of kmno4 paraffin mass ratio release experiments were conducted for crb with kmno4 paraffin mass ratio of 4 1 5 1 and 6 1 to explore the impact of bead size release experiments were conducted for crbs with diameters of 1 cm and 2 cm the mno4 paraffin mass ratio in this experiment was 6 1 to explore the impact of temperature release experiments were conducted at 4 15 30 40 and 50 c to explore the impact of solution ph release experiments were conducted at ph of 3 0 4 0 10 0 11 0 and 12 0 crbs with kmno4 paraffin mass ratio of 5 1 were used for experiments of ph 2 3 4 and 7 crb with kmno4 paraffin mass ratio of 6 1 were used for experiments of ph 7 10 11 and 12 to explore the impact of water volume release experiments were conducted in reactor containing 50 100 200 and 300 ml of water to explore the impact of anions experiments were conducted in reactors containing 10 mm of nacl nabr na2co3 and na2so4 2 4 analysis the kmno4 concentration was analyzed using a uv visible spectrophotometer cary 60 agilent usa by measuring the absorption at 525 nm wavelength at each sampling time 100 μl solution was collected and diluted 200 times before kmno4 concentration measurement the morphology and pore structures of crb before and after the release experiment were characterized using a fei quanta 250 environmental scanning electron microscope esem thermofisher usa 3 results and discussion 3 1 conceptual model of kmno4 controlled release kmno4 release patterns in all batch experiments had similar biphasic trends which were characterized by an initial rapid release followed by a slow and sustained release later fig 1 we proposed a conceptual model to explain the biphasic trends kmno4 release from control release bead crb is a dissolution diffusion process fig 2 the initial fast release was due to rapid dissolution of kmno4 particles embedded on the surface of the crb which were readily assessible to bulk water fig 3 a dissolution of kmno4 particles left empty crevices or pores which generated inter bead openings and channels within the bead matrix the empty crevices formed after kmno4 dissolution were verified by environmental scanning electron microscope fig 3b as a result water penetrated into the bead matrix and contacted with the remaining kmno4 inside once contacted with penetrating water kmno4 inside the bead dissolved and diffused through pore water to reach the bulk water outside the bead the bead matrix containing kmno4 is named kmno4 undissolved zone and the bead matrix with pore space occupied by penetrating water is named kmno4 dissolved zone fig 2 the interface between kmno4 undissolved zone and kmno4 dissolved zone is named dissolution front kmno4 dissolution occurred on the dissolution front since aqueous phase diffusion in the pore water is relatively slow kmno4 release rate gradually decreased as the dissolution front moved from the bead surface into the bead core this step is the key mechanism for the controlled and sustained release of crb based on this conceptual model a detailed mathematical model was further developed in section 3 4 3 2 key parameters describing kmno4 release kinetics four parameters including release longevity release rate total kmno4 mass released and release efficiency are used in the following text to illustrate the kmno4 release kinetics release longevity t longevity day is defined as how long crbs can sustain kmno4 release which can be described by the time for the dissolved kmno4 concentration to reach a plateau level in fig 1 total kmno4 mass released from the bead m mg is defined as the cumulative mass of kmno4 released at time t longevity release rate r mg day g bead is defined as the quantity of kmno4 released per unit time and the total mass of crb which can be calculated by equation 1 m crb is the total mass of crb release efficiency is defined as the proportion of the released kmno4 mass to the total kmno4 mass in the crb which can be calculated by multiplying m crb by the ratio of kmno4 in crb 1 r m t l o n g e v i t y m c r b 3 3 impacts of crb properties and environmental conditions on kmno4 release kinetics 3 3 1 kmno4 paraffin mass ratio of crb higher kmno4 paraffin mass ratio resulted in shorter release longevities and higher release rate the release longevity of crbs with kmno4 paraffin ratio of 6 1 5 1 and 4 1 were 9 23 37 days respectively fig 1a and table s1 kang et al reported similar phenomenon for paraffin kmno4 pellet kang et al 2004 they found that the theoretical release longevity of the pellets with kmno4 paraffin mass ratios of 1 1 1 2 and 1 5 were 1 6 months 19 3 years and 472 years respectively kang et al 2004 higher kmno4 paraffin mass ratios also resulted in faster release rate table s1 hydrophobic paraffin hinder water penetration into the pore space of bead matrix thus slowing down the kmno4 dissolution rate and release rate liang and chen 2017 therefore crbs with higher kmno4 paraffin mass ratio had lower release rate and longer release longevity more sustained release almost 100 kmno4 encapsulated in the crb were finally released into the water for kmno4 paraffin ratio of 4 1 5 1 and 6 1 initial kmno4 mass were 832 mg 796 mg and 728 mg respectively and 100 1 100 2 and 99 of the initial kmno4 mass were finally released table s1 this shows that our crb has a very high release efficiency and almost all kmno4 can release and used for contaminant oxidation in contrast liang et al reported a much lower release efficiency for crms they made liang et al 2014 their crm contained kmno4 polycaprolactone and starch 63 8 after 76 days of release 3 3 2 size of crb larger bead resulted in lower release rate longer release longevity and more kmno4 released the kmno4 release rate of 1 cm bead was 5 times higher than that of 2 cm bead fig 1b and table s2 the release longevity of 2 cm bead was 4 5 times longer than that of 1 cm bead similar results have been reported for persulfate paraffin candles kambhu et al found that the persulfate release rate of 0 71 and 1 27 cm candles were 97 mg day g candle and 30 mg day g candle and the corresponding release longevity were 6 and 25 days respectively kambhu et al 2012 larger beads had smaller specific surface area i e mass transfer interface area which led to lower release rate larger beads contained more kmno4 thus resulting in more kmno4 released the total mass of kmno4 released from 2 cm beads was 8 times of that of 1 cm beads table s2 similar phenomenon was reported by sakulthaew et al sakulthaew and chokejaroenrat 2016 they explored the impact of the size of control release candle 1 28 0 64 0 32 cm in length and found 1 28 cm candle released the maximum amount of kmno4 sakulthaew and chokejaroenrat 2016 since larger beads contained more kmno4 but have lower release rate their release longevities were much longer the release efficiency of both 1 cm and 2 cm crb were all closed to 100 table s2 3 3 3 temperature higher incubation temperature resulted in higher release rate and shorter release longevity as the temperature increased from 4 to 50 c the kmno4 release rate increased from 12 6 mg day g bead to 283 1 mg day g bead and the kmno4 release longevity decreased from 60 to 3 days fig 1c and table s3 high temperature accelerated the molecular thermodynamic motion both dissolution and diffusion of kmno4 were promoted by high temperature therefore the overall kmno4 release rate increased with temperature xiong et al also found that temperature significantly increased the release rate of kmno4 granules xiong et al 2016 temperature did not affect the total mass of kmno4 released nearly of 100 of the kmno4 was released from the beads at temperatures from 4 to 50 c table s3 3 3 4 solution ph acidic ph reduced the total amount of kmno4 that can be released while alkaline ph did not affect kmno4 release kmno4 release experiments were conducted under ph 2 3 4 7 control 10 11 and 12 note that crbs with kmno4 paraffin mass ratio of 5 1 were used for experiments of ph 2 3 and 4 but crbs with kmno4 paraffin mass ratio of 6 1 were used for experiments of ph 10 11 and 12 the treatment of ph 2 3 and 4 had significantly lower total amount of kmno4 released while the treatment of ph 10 11 and 12 released almost 100 of kmno4 fig 1d and e and table s4 crbs incubated at ph 2 only release 58 5 of kmno4 xiong et al found that the kmno4 release efficiency of kmno4 wax granules increased as the solution ph increased from 6 to 8 xiong et al 2016 kmno4 can spontaneously decompose into mno2 and o2 reaction 1 seol et al 2003 this reaction is very slow at neutral and alkaline ph but is accelerated by h reaction 2 xiong et al 2016 at ph 2 4 acidic ph promoted kmno4 decomposition and produced mno2 the produced mno2 plug the pores inside the bead seol et al 2003 west et al 2008 and reduced the bead permeability li and schwartz 2004a b this reduced the kmno4 release rate and decreased the total amount of kmno4 that can be released although we did not measure the production of mno2 and o2 increasing ph level during batch release experiment provided an indirect evidence for the occurrence of reaction 2 at ph 2 4 table s4 1a 4 m n o 4 2 h 2 o 4 m n o 2 3 o 2 4 o h 2a 4 m n o 4 4 h 4 m n o 2 3 o 2 2 h 2 o 3 3 5 water volume in reactors kmno4 release kinetics were monitored for the same crbs that were incubated in the reactors with different volume of water the total amount of kmno4 released from the same crbs was independent of the volume of water in the reactors containing 50 100 200 and 300 ml of water 786 798 763 and 790 mg of kmno4 were finally released and the corresponding kmno4 release efficiency were 98 8 100 2 95 8 and 99 2 fig 1f and table s5 indicating that the crbs kept high release efficiency in different volume of water the kmno4 release rate and release longevity were independent of the volume of water for the reactors containing 50 300 ml of water the release rate was 33 3 36 4 mg day g bead and the release longevity was 23 24 days liang and chen conducted the flow through experiments to monitor the persulfate release kinetics from sustained release rods with different water flushing rate and found that the release longevity were similar and were not affected by flushing rate liang and chen 2017 3 3 6 water matrix anions the presence of so4 2 co3 2 cl and br had negligible impacts on kmno4 release the release plots of the treatments containing 10 mm of so4 2 co3 2 cl and br overlapped with the plot of the no anion control fig 1g the total mass of kmno4 released and the release efficiency in the presence of so4 2 co3 2 cl and br were very close to the control table s6 to our best knowledge the impacts of water chemistry on crm release kinetics have never been investigated our results suggest that common water matrix anions play negligible roles in determining the releases characteristics of crm 3 4 mathematical model that simulate kmno4 controlled release 3 4 1 model development based on the conceptual mode presented in section 3 1 and the experimental results presented in section 3 3 a detailed two film boundary dissolution diffusion mathematical model was developed this model was based on the following assumptions 1 dissolution of kmno4 occurs only at the interface between the dissolved zone and undissolved zone i e on the dissolution front 2 the aqueous concentration of kmno4 on the dissolution front is its solubility 3 once kmno4 reached bulk water outside crb it immediately distributed evenly in the entire bulk water 4 kmno4 decomposition reactions reaction 1 and 2 are not considered table 2 lists all symbols used in the mathematical model kmno4 release from crb was a dissolution diffusion process thus the kmno4 mass release rate dm dt kg s can be calculated by fick s law equation 2 2 d m s d t d e d c d r 3 s 4 π r 2 c substitute equation 3 into equation

data cumulative mass of kmno4 released m presented in fig 1 can be incorporated into equation 12 to calculate the radius of the undissolved zone r in crb the calculated r and the corresponding release time t are then incorporated into equation 18 to calculate the effective diffusion coefficient de the de values calculated based on data of fig 1 were plotted against the radius of the undissolved zone r fig s1 as fig s1 shows crb composition and temperature significantly changed the value of de but bead size has relatively small impacts interestingly the relationship between de and temperature well satisfied the arrhenius formula which provided the basis to predict the kmno4 release kinetics at different temperatures table s7 and fig s2 diffusion is a temperature dependent process engel and reid 2012 higher temperature often results in higher diffusion rate since diffusion is the result of random movements of particles that move particles from areas of high concentration to areas of lower concentration as temperature increases particle movement rates increase thus resulting in faster diffusion engel and reid 2012 many studies have showed that the diffusion coefficient of various compounds in water solution showed arrhenius type behaviors thus corroborating our results bonoli and witherspoon 1968 poudyal and adhikari 2014 rossi et al 2015 sharma and adhikari 2014 witherspoon and saraf 1965 18 m 4 3 π a r 0 3 r 3 fig 4 show the predicted kmno4 concentration released by our model and the concentration measured under different scenarios kmno4 paraffin mass ratio bead size temperature water volume in reactors the modeling results are very close to the measured data verifying the reliability of our model details on model simulation process can be found in text s1 of the supplementary material 3 4 3 more scenarios predicted by model the model was used to predict kmno4 release process under different conditions e g kmno4 paraffin mass ratio bead diameter and temperature details on model simulation process can be found in text s1 of the supplementary material fig 5 shows that model simulation results were consistent with the batch experimental results corroborating that 1 higher kmno4 paraffin mass ratio resulted in shorter release longevities and higher release rate 2 larger bead resulted in lower release rate longer release longevity and more kmno4 released 3 higher incubation temperature resulted in higher release rate and shorter release longevity but the total mass of kmno4 released and the release efficiency kept the same our model did not consider chemical reactions so influence of solution ph and water matrix anions can not be modeled since release longevity is a key design parameter for crm based isco remedial system we simulated the kmno4 release longevity under different scenarios bead diameter ranging from 1 cm to 7 cm and temperature at 4 c 15 c and 30 c fig 6 suggests that release longevity significantly increases with increasing bead size the bead with diameters of 7 cm could keep releasing for several years which is corroborated by a five year monitoring field study christenson et al 2016 christenson et al kmno4 candles with the length of 91 4 cm long and diameter of 5 1 cm or 7 6 cm still maintain an inner undissolved core after five years of release groundwater temperature is another critical parameter that greatly influenced the release longevity this should be considered when design crm based isco system for contaminated sites located in different climate zone although our mathematical model has several limitations fig 5 can be used as references by practitioners and engineers for technology selection design and maintenance persulfate is another commonly used controlled release isco oxidant similar to kmno4 persufalte is also an inorganic salt thus the controlled release process of persulfate based crm may also follow the dissolution diffusion conceptual model and the mathematical model developed for kmno4 may also be applicable to persulfate further release experiments are needed to test the applicability of the mathematical model to descript persulfate sustained release 4 conclusions successful implementation of controlled release materials crm technology relies on good understandings of kinetics and mechanism of controlled release of reactive agents in this study the kmno4 paraffin controlled release beads crbs with near 100 release efficiency were constructed batch experiments show that both crm properties size and composition and environmental conditions temperature ph water volume and anions significantly affect the release kinetics these factors should be considered in the design and maintenance of crm based isco system a dissolution diffusion conceptual model was developed to qualitatively explain the experimental data as well as the associated controlled release mechanisms based on these results a more detailed two film boundary mathematical model was established comparison of modeling results with experimental data suggest that the new mathematical model can give good quantitative predications our results suggest that properly designed crm can sustain reagent release for years without replenishments therefore crm represents a cost effective and low maintenance technology that can provide a long term solution for

18179,contamination by herbicides such as clopyralid clp poses a significant threat to human health and ecological systems in the present study efficient removal of clp was achieved by thermo activated persulfate among which sulfate radical was identified as the predominant oxidizing species responsible for the decontamination based on high resolution lc ms derivatization method and density functional theory dft computation the detailed oxidation pathways and mechanisms were proposed the primary oxidation pathways included dechlorination hydroxylation decarboxylation and the formation of quinone like moieties afterwards numerous intermediate byproducts ranging from high molecular to very small ones were identified suggesting the pyridine ring was damaged during the thermo activated persulfate process the detected products containing six and five carbons indicated the pyridine ring cleavage would take place on the quinone structure intermediate further oxidation could continue by breaking each bond on the ring cleavage product yielding a series of short chain carbonyl chemicals carboxylic acids and inorganic ions in addition the presence of dissolved oxygen do was favorable to clp degradation indicating do played an important role in applying such technology the degradation rate constants of clp increased appreciably with increasing temperature and acidic ph facilitated the clp degradation the results obtained in this work would increase our understanding on the environmental fates of nitrogen heterocyclic compounds during sulfate radical so4 based advanced oxidation processes sr aops graphical abstract image 1 keywords sulfate radical pyridine ring cleavage derivatization dissolved oxygen dft calculation 1 introduction sulfate radical so4 based

effectively eliminate contaminants in waters fang et al 2012 so4 e0 2 5 3 1 v is able to oxidize many organic compounds thermodynamically feasible with a second order rate constant ranging from 106 to 109 m 1s 1 ji et al 2016 nitrogen heterocyclic compounds like pyridine and pyridine derivatives have received increasing scientific attention due to their occurrence in the environment and the associated hazard to human health and ecosystems liao et al 2013 stapleton et al 2010 pyridine and its derivatives are normally used as chemical intermediates in the fabrication of pesticides herbicides and pharmaceuticals dell arciprete et al 2007 such chemicals could be released into the environment as a consequence of their widespread use as well as be discharged from urban and industrial effluents padoley et al 2008 clopyralid 3 6 dichhoropyridine 2 carboylic acid clp is a selective herbicide from the chemical class of pyridine compounds and it is normally used to control broad leaf weeds in certain crops abramovic et al 2007 clp presents high water solubility 1000 mg l 1 xu et al 2013 and is environmentally stable with a half life time up to 11 months ebato et al 2015 moreover due to its chemical activity it can penetrate through the soil causing a long term contamination of underground water and surface water corredor et al 2006 in north america concentrations up to 1050 ng l 1 clp were detected in reservoirs fed by snowmelt and rainfall runoff donald et al 2007a clp is hazardous to some endangered plant species and toxic to mammals for instance research studies have shown that clp was evaluated for teratogenic potential in rats hayes et al 1984 also clp spray drifts to sensitive agricultural areas such as potatoes may result in lost yields and economic losses wall 1994 clp is among most abundant chemicals that can be detected in drinking water donald et al 2007b and makes a potential threat to human health as well as ecological systems therefore efforts are needed for a complete removal or at least reduction of its level during the past years various advanced oxidation processes aops have been reported for the removal of clp or its structurally similar chemicals berberidou et al 2016 semitsoglou tsiapou et al 2016 tizaoui et al 2011 such aops can accomplish partial or total degradation of clp while complete mineralization of the reaction solutions is assumed to be unreachable most of past studies have focused on the concentration decrease of the target contaminants and the identification of the main oxidation products nevertheless it has been reported that for the photo degradation of clp a series of short chain carboxylic acids and inorganic ions were detected indicating the occurrence of ring opening reactions xu et al 2013 similar ring cleavage oxidations were also found in the work of westphal et al 2013 where maleic oxalic and oxamic acids as well as chloride were detected and gradually increased with time in the homogeneous fenton reaction recently studies found the pyridine ring break could also take place on the ortho quinone or the ortho hydroxyl structure intermediate for instance li et al 2016 have reported that during the oxidation of 2 3 dihydroxy pyridine an ortho quinone like structure intermediate were observed then further oxidation would take place to form open ring products a similar result was also obtained by zhang et al 2014 who found that ring opening oxidation occurs at the ortho position these findings suggest that clp transformation by ring cleavage and the formation of quinone like products might be important degradation pathways however activation and ultimately destruction of the strong bonds present in pyridine n heterocycles is a significant challenge and our knowledge of the details of the clp chemical processes that involve pyridine ring opening remains limited hence the goal of this study was to investigate the detailed mechanism of clp degradation by reaction with so4 which was generated by using thermo activated ps our main objectives were 1 to identify the primary and secondary carbonyl oxidation products and to propose transformation pathways of clp by sulfate radical 2 based on that to further clarify clp pyridine ring opening process and mechanism 3 finally to evaluate the oxidation efficiency for the removal clp

shimadzu japan 2 4 computational method all the dft calculations were performed with the gaussian 09 package frisch et al 2009 the b3lyp hybrid exchange correlation functional was used for geometry

imaginary frequency for the correct mode the stable species minima were verified to have all real frequencies only the intrinsic reaction coordinate irc following was also conducted for the transition states to verify that they connect two corresponding minima in addition frontier electron densities feds of highest occupied molecular orbitals homo and lowest unoccupied molecular orbitals lumo were determined values of fed2 homo fed2 lumo were calculated to predict reaction sites for the addition of so4 zhou et al 2019 2 5 kinetic study in all the cases and in the different conditions the degradation of clp followed pseudo first order kinetics as described by eq 1 1 ln clp t clp 0 k obs t where k obs is the pseudo first order rate constant clp t represents the concentration of clp at the specific reaction time t and clp 0 is the initial concentration of clp 3 results and discussion 3 1 identification of major reactive species preliminary experiments showed that efficient degradation of clp could be achieved by thermo activated persulfate process under heating temperature at 50 c the removal of clp increased with increasing ps concentration fig s1 sm in accordance with most published works feng et al 2017 nie et al 2014 for example approximately 57 of clp was attenuated in the presence of 1 0 mm ps while more than 74 was removed after the same time period when the initial ps concentration was set at 2 0 mm it is generally accepted that sulfate radical and hydroxyl radical are responsible for the oxidation of clp in thermo activated ps process gao et al 2016 nie et al 2014 to obtain a detailed insight into the reaction pathway and mechanism of clp degradation specific scavengers namely ethanol etoh and tert butanol tba were introduced in the system to evaluate the contributions of ho and so4 zhou et al 2017 different reactivities of these scavengers towards ho and so4 were used to distinguish the dominant radical species in the reaction solutions eqs 2 5 2 etoh ho intermediates k 2 00 109 m 1s 1 3 etoh so4 intermediates k 4 65 107 m 1s 1 4 tba ho intermediates k 5 70 108 m 1s 1 5 tba so4 intermediates k 6 55 105 m 1s 1 in the presence of 2 mm ps at 60 c and ph of 6 0 10 mm phosphate buffer clp degraded at a rate constant of 2 25 10 2 min 1 after the addition of etoh 2 mm and tba 2 mm the decay rate decreased to 0 18 10 2 and 1 49 10 2 min 1 respectively fig s2 this result suggests that ho may play a secondary role in clp transformation it is worthwhile mentioning that etoh scavenges both ho and so4 while tba is a rather selective ho scavenger thus by postulating a quasi stationary state for ho and so4 one gets eqs 6 and 7 upon addition of tba added 6 r o h k o h c l p oh clp k 4 oh tba 7 r s o 4 k s o 4 c l p so 4 clp k 5 so 4 tba this allows the determination of ho and so4 and the degradation of clp can be written as follows 8 r c l p t b a k o h c l p oh clp k s o 4 c l p so 4 clp k o h c l p clp k o h c l p clp k 4 tba r o h k s o 4 c l p clp k s o 4 c l p clp k 5 tba r s o 4 using eq 8 we attempted to assess the contributions of ho and so4 to clp degradation the second order rate constant for clp with ho has been determined at 2 0 108 m 1s 1 semitsoglou tsiapou et al 2016 because the accurate rate constant for so4 with clp was not available herein we used the value for pyridine with so4 at 2 2 108 m 1s 1 therefore when tba clp 100 r clp tba is equal to 9 r c l p t b a 0 0035 r o h 0 77 r s o 4 and in the absence of tba r clp equals to 10 r c l p r o h r s o 4 as mentioned above the values of r clp tba and r clp were estimated at 2 25 10 2 and 2 14 10 2 min 1 respectively thus we can obtain the value of r oh at 0 21 10 3 min 1 indicating that the contribution of ho was quite limited and so4 was the predominant radical in our reaction therefore the following discussion will focus on the interaction of clp with so4 instead of ho 3 2 oxidation products identification 3 2 1 primary oxidation products identification by hr ms the oxidation products generated via reaction between clp and sulfate radicals were firstly identified with the spe hr ms technique using the ms data in negative mode as illustrated in table s2 sm the presence of a cl atom was confirmed by the two isotopic peaks at m and m 1 9971 the parent compound clp was identified firstly at the retention time rt of 1 85 min with m z at 189 9482 191 9450 and 193 9420 in negative mode following this procedure 3 different transformation products tps were identified from the total ion current chromatograms tic of spe enriched samples specifically at rt of 2 46 min tps with m z 205 9429 207 9400 and 209 9369 were identified as the hydroxylation product of clp tp 2 at 1 87 min a decarboxylated tp m z 145 9580 147 9550 and 149 9522 namely 2 5 dichloropyridine tp 1 was observed the last tp with m z of 161 95291 163 94997 and 165 94695 at 5 24 min was labelled as tp 3 which can be formed via hydroxylation of tp 1 or decarboxylation of tp 2 3 2 2 secondary carbonyl products identification by dnph derivatization in order to characterize possible carbonyl intermediates and especially the tps with small molecular weights such as carboxylated and carbonylated compounds using dnph 2 4 dinitrophenylhydrazine derivatization followed by analysis with hr ms was employed in the present study this method can trap carbonyl compounds and separate them from the other by products while the ms analysis is made necessary to get their molecular mass tafer et al 2016 specifically a series of oxidation byproducts were identified and all the detected molecules were oxygenated chemicals ranging from c6 c1 as seen in table 1 and in the detailed ms data shown in fig s3 and table s3 sm the structures given in tables 1 and s3 were proposed based on derivatization data uv absorption around 220 nm 260 nm and 360 nm as well as literature data if any in most cases the established structure listed here is just one eight groups of c6 and c5 tps tp 4 11 were detected in hr ms and some of them are proposed to bear quinone or quinone like structures before the cleavage of the pyridine ring three groups of oxidation products in negative mode were observed specifically tp 4 with m z 348 0222 exhibited three different peaks in the tic spectrum corresponding to three different positions of double bond coupling with dnph tp 4 was assigned as 4 hydroxy 3 6 dioxo 3 6 dihydropyridine 2 carboxylic acid in which two cl atoms on the pyridine ring were both initially substituted by oh groups followed by further oxidation to form the quinone structure similar 4 6 dihydroxypyridine 2 5 dione and 6 hydroxypyridine 2 5 dione exhibited significant peaks in tic and were labelled as tp 5 and tp 6 respectively among tp 4 to tp 6 byproducts tp 5 was the most abundant furthermore numerous carbonyl oxidation products were also detected in hr ms indicating a pyridine ring cleavage pathway tp 7 m z 350 0378 was labelled as the ring cleavage product with an ortho quinone structure tp 8 9 m z 322 0249 and tp 10 11 m z 338 0378 were also obvious products of pyridine ring opening from different positions but their signals in tic were relatively weaker than tp 4 6 otherwise five c4 and eight c3 tps were observed among which c3 products were more abundant than c4 a total of ten c2 and cl chemicals were detected and most of them are assigned as acids or aldehydes which are often regarded as end products in the extended oxidation of organic contaminants herrmann et al 1999 3 3 oxidation pathways and mechanisms 3 3 1 mechanisms of clp primary oxidation pathway on the basis of the hr ms and dft calculation results the degradation mechanism of clp oxidized by the sulfate radical was proposed as shown in fig 1 according to frontier orbital theory positions with higher values of fed2 homo fed2 lumo are more susceptible to electrophilic sulfate addition ji et al 2013 firstly in order to clarify the initial step in ps thermo activated oxidation that involves the clp molecule reacting with so4 we performed the dft calculations and the results are listed in table s4 sm for clp 2c and 3c positions possess higher fed2 homo fed2 lumo values and these positions are more likely to be attacked by so4 therefore for two tps oxidation by so4 and deprotonation can be proposed as seen in fig 2 the initial step was believed to be the sulfate addition on 2c and 3c positions to form the intermediates iii and iv respectively transition states i for iii ii for iv were found to have sulfate addition on the heterocyclic ring with energy barriers at 10 0 kcal mol from i to iii and 4 6 kcal mol from ii to iv respectively these two energy barriers were both easy to overcome in the heated reaction system 50 c however the formation of species ⅰ is thermodynamically less favorable due to its relatively higher energy level with respect to ⅱ thus sulfate addition on 2c is discussed in the following part more thoroughly after sulfate addition iv would undergo hydrolysis to produce vi via another transition state v with sulfate and hydroxyl addition the energy barrier for this process was not high 7 8 kcal mol and we expect that the excess energy in the reaction system is sufficient to overcome it then the attached sulfate is detached from the pyridine ring through the excited state vii yielding a radical cation tp 2 viii this process is barrierless viii is still unstable and could continue to react with another sulfate radical leading to the formation of tp 2 the process vi 1 1 kcal mol vii 1 7 kcal mol viii 23 0 kcal mol tp 2 106 6 kcal mol would not require additional energy and could take place spontaneously to summarize the dft calculation revealed that the initial step was an electron transfer from clp to so4 and a radical cation tp 2 could be formed which was prone to further reaction with so4 leading to the formation of tp 2 another possibility for this hydroxylation process is electron abstraction followed by reaction of the radical cation with water after deprotonation one gets the same species that would also be formed by radical ho addition that species can lose h by reaction with o2 giving the hydroxylated derivative the production of hydroxylated derivatives is a classic pathway of the sulfate radical attack on the benzene ring which is similar to the reaction of smx with so4 resulting in the production of hydroxylated smx ji et al 2015 these hydroxylation processes were also observed in the oxidation of 2 4 dichlorophenoxyacetic acid by so4 chen et al 2017 in addition under the attack of so4 decarboxylation could take place on tp 2 and clp yielding tp 3 and tp 1 respectively similar hydroxylation de chlorination and decarboxylation pathways and these three main products were also reported by semitsoglou tsiapou et al 2016 in the low pressure uv h2o2 system that operates through oh radicals as seen in fig 1 tp 1 and tp 2 might be processed through two different pathways to generate tp 4 to tp 6 the first possibility is to from the substitution of cl by a hydroxyl group and tp 4 tp 6 could be formed previous study under different conditions has reported a product formed by de chlorination and oh radical substitution on one of the two chlorine bearing pyridine rings sojic et al 2009 however this hypothesis was not supported by our experimental data mainly due to the intermediates formed by de chlorination and hydroxylated substitution not being detected in the present work this might be due to the quick transformation of these products preventing their accumulation to reach the detection limit another possibility is the multiple step oxidation of tp 1 and tp 2 to generate the quinone structure products tp 4 and tp 6 which also requires a de chlorination reaction these oxidation pathways were proposed mainly based on the dft calculations specifically similar to clp the initial step for the reaction of tp 1 with so4 would also be the sulfate addition process on 2c position fig s4 sm in this process a transition state with an easily overcome energy barrier of 4 6 kcal mol was estimated afterwards the sulfate adduct could combine with an oh and the release of cl would take place subsequently h abstraction on different positions and sulfate release would occur leading to the formation of two carbon centered radicals containing a carbonyl group depending on the h abstraction positions it should be noted that these two carbon centered radicals could convert into each other fig s5 sm afterwards the unstable carbon centered radical could further react with another so4 and finally produce tp 4 similar reactions might also take place on tp 2 to the best of our knowledge we reported for the first time the formation of these quinone structure products during thermo activated ps oxidation of clp notably direct evidences for the two proposed pathways were still lacking thus further analytical strategies for the identification of hydroxylated products as well as the carbon centered radicals are required to better clarify the underlying mechanisms 3 3 2 further oxidation clp is supposed to be oxidized sequentially and to generate a variety of new compounds heat activated degradation of organic pollutants usually leads to structure break and ultimately conversion into co2 and h2o which can be visualized by the decrease of toc the toc remained quite stable and only 17 9 of it was removed after 120 min by comparison 41 7 clp was degraded by using dnph derivatization followed by analysis with hr ms method we detected a series of short chain products containing different carbon atoms which may explain why the toc did not decrease based on the detection of intermediates and final small molecules a possible degradation mechanism of clp through a ring opening process was discussed in this section the nitrogen atom present in aromatic heterocyclic pyridine has an electron withdrawing effect and can lower the π charge density of the pyridine ring active species could induce an electrophilic reaction in pyridine oxidation by attacking ring positions with high electron density as an electron donating substituent the hydroxyl group could activate the pyridine ring which could be oxidized in the ortho position or meta position and further form quinone structures aramendía et al 2008 previous work found oxygen and hydroxylation were essential for the ring cleavage and it was widely agreed that a polyhydroxylated aromatic ring is more easily opened pang et al 2014 for instance jacob et al 1977 reported in the reaction of ho with benzene and oxygen in aqueous solution that benzene firstly transformed to phenol and then some small carboxylic acid products were observed as the degree of hydroxylation increased the pyridine ring can undergo further oxidation and cleavage therefore we speculate that ring opening easily occurred on hydroxylated products tp 4 to tp 6 in the present work several five carbon and four carbon aldehyde and carboxylic products obtained by loss of one carbon atom were detected by using dnph derivatization indicating pyridine damage during oxidation also short chain products such as carboxylic acids aldehydes were detected moreover the tp 7 was detected which is possibly obtained by fragmentation of an ortho quinone structure we proposed that the ring cleavage reaction was started from the quinone like intermediates take one of aliphatic compounds e 3 z carboxymethylene amino 3 hydroxyacrylic acid tp 10 as an example it still contained five carbon atoms and one nitrogen atom although it was identified with some uncertainty its formation could result from the ring opening of tp 6 and tp 5 as seen in fig 3 tp 10 could undergo oxidative each bond cleavage and the ring cleavage products could again oxidize when the 2 3 bond of tp 10 is broken it is expected to generate formic acid tp 33 and tp 12 which has four carbons and an aldehyde group that will be further oxidized to a carboxyl group leading to the formation of tp 14 similarly after 4 5 bond cleavage we got a product which was unstable and further oxidized to form tp 13 the oxidation of tp 10 could also take place by 1 2 bond cleavage which would give acetic acid and its corresponding carboxylated products tp 17 and tp 19 however we didn t detect acetic acid directly but its oxidation products 2 oxoacetic acid tp 29 was observed when the cleavage occurred on the 1 6 bond we detected the direct products 3 oxopropanoic acid tp 16 and 2 iminoacetic acid tp 27 as well as malonic acid tp 23 which was further oxidized by tp16 when the 5 6 bond breaks the pyridine ring was broken up into small compounds namely tp 18 which contained amino groups as well as tp 29 among all the by products detected by using dnph derivatization formaldehyde tp 32 was the most abundant as seen from fig s6 formation of tp 32 gradually increased with oxidation time and reached a maximum at around 60 min after which a slight decline was started 3 4 reaction kinetics 3 4 1 impact of oxygen dissolved oxygen do is one of the most important components in natural water and recent studies have assessed its influence on so4 mediated oxidation of organic micro pollutants the impact of do mainly depends on the generation of so4 ultimately influencing the degradation efficiency and pathways of organic contaminants beylerian et al 2002 criquet and leitner 2015 liu et al 2016 for instance tan et al 2013 reported the degradation rate of antipyrine decreased with the increasing concentration of do this is mainly due to the sulfate radical is shifted to persulfate ion under anaerobic condition eq 11 14 moreover liu et al 2016 found that radical chain reactions were strongly affected by do whereas from a theoretical point of view do has the potential to accelerate the so4 induced oxidation by decreasing the energy barrier zhang et al 2018 11 o 2 e a q o 2 12 s 2 o 8 2 2 h 2 o h o 2 2 s o 4 2 3 h 13 h o 2 s 2 o 8 2 s o 4 s o 4 2 h o 2 14 2 s 2 o 8 2 2 h 2 o 3 s o 4 2 s o 4 o 2 4 h thus experiments were carried out to determine the impact of sr aops on clp degradation under anaerobic and aerobic conditions as seen in fig 4 a the control experiments showed a fast degradation of clp with a rate constant of 0 0205 min 1 in the absence of oxygen the rate constant decreased to 0 0055 min 1 these data show a beneficial impact of the presence of oxygen on the degradation of clp indicating do is involved somewhere in the reaction pathway in order to clarify the oxygen involved mechanisms a possible minor degradation pathway for tp 1 is proposed in scheme 1 the lone electron on the clp oh ring is attacked by do to generate clp oh o2 that is unstable therefore after a hoo dissociation the formation of tp 1 could be achieved for so4 induced oxidation in the absence of do two sulfate radicals are required for the formation of one clp oh fig 1 in the presence of do the production of one molecule of clp oh would consume one so4 and one molecule of oxygen therefore the presence of oxygen increases the efficiency of the formation of tp 1 as well as the degradation of clp these results suggest that oxygen is very important in sr aops and this technology should be used under aerobic conditions 3 4 2 temperature effects temperature normally plays a critical role in the thermo activated ps degradation process fig 4 b shows that increasing temperature led to higher k obs values which is consistent with degradation of other contaminants by the thermo activated process manz and carter 2017 waldemer et al 2007 the k obs value of clp increased from 0 3 10 3 min 1 at 303 k to 3 29 10 2 min 1 at 333 k higher temperature could accelerate the decomposition of ps and enhance the formation of sulfate radical which in turn facilitates the oxidation of the target compounds johnson et al 2008 15 ln k obs lna e a rt the temperature dependence of kobs was further evaluated with the arrhenius equation eq 15 where a is the pre exponential factor ea is the apparent activation energy kj mol 1 r is the universal gas constant 8 314 j mol 1k 1 and t is the absolute temperature the results suggested a linear relationship between ln kobs and 1 t and from the slope value of the line the activation energy of clp was determined to be 140 0 kj mol 1 3 4 3 effect of ph fig 4 c shows the clp degradation under different ph values at 50 c in the presence of 2 mm ps 10 mm phosphate buffer stock solutions were added to each reaction solution to obtain the desired ph value due to the phosphate buffer the change of solution ph was negligible while the solution ph without buffers gradually decreased from 5 2 to an acidic value of 4 2 4 8 after 2 h also the scavenging effect of phosphate species on so4 was considered as minimal in the present work gao et al 2016 with the increase of solution ph clp degradation was inhibited the kobs of clp decreased from 1 2 10 2min 1 to 7 6 10 3 5 1 10 3 5 0 10 3min 1 and 1 8 10 3 min 1 as the solution ph increased from 4 82 to 6 10 7 15 7 95 and 10 19 respectively neutral clp is the leading form under acidic ph values while anionic clp is the predominant form at basic conditions the removal efficiency is highly ph dependent and acidic conditions are more favorable for clp degradation similar results were also obtained in photo degradation photocatalytic degradation and fenton reactions of clp berberidou et al 2016 westphal et al 2013 xu et al 2013 the following pathways may contribute to this result first according to the nernstian equation the redox potential of so4 is higher at acidic ph which may increase the k obs cai et al 2018 furthermore under alkaline conditions the mineralization of clp may produce some bicarbonate and carbonate ions that can inhibit the oxidation processes qian et al 2018 lipczynska kochany et al 1995 documented that the oxidation rate of 4 chlorophenol by ho in the fenton reaction was inhibited by various anions such as sulfate ion and bicarbonate 4 conclusion in the present work thermo activated ps oxidation of aqueous clp was systematically investigated the efficient elimination of clp could be achieved by thermo activated persulfate and clp degradation followed pseudo first order reaction kinetics by the use of chemical scavengers so4 was identified as the predominant oxidizing species responsible for clp degradation primary byproducts were identified by hr ms and the transformation pathway included dechlorination hydroxylation and decarboxylation as well as the formation of quinone like moieties afterwards numerous intermediate byproducts ranging from high molecular weight to very small were identified by making use of dnph derivatization methods the detected short chain carboxylic acids aldehyde like compounds and inorganic ions indicated the pyridine ring was fragmented during the activated ps oxidation process based on the detected products containing six and five carbons we concluded the pyridine ring cleavage process would take place on the quinone structure intermediate by using the model compound tp 10 it was proved that the ring cleavage products could continue oxidizing by oxidative bond implications of thermo activated ps process to water treatment were further evaluated by investigating the controlling factors specifically increasing the temperature significantly enhanced the degradation of clp the oxidation of clp appeared to be highly ph dependent and higher ph showed inhibitory effects in the absence of do the rate constant decreased significantly indicating oxygen plays an important role in applying such technology formaldehyde concentration was found extremely high after 120 min reaction time and the toc remained quite stable because of the volatility and toxicity of formaldehyde it may become a potential atmospheric pollutant we concluded that heat activated ps was an efficient approach to eliminate clp in water but insufficient reaction time will result in incomplete degradation and formation of potential pollutants practical application of this technology under environmentally realistic condition should be investigated further because naturally existing constituents may have deep impacts on clp degradation the results of this work could help better understand clp fate during sr aops treatment declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal

18179,contamination by herbicides such as clopyralid clp poses a significant threat to human health and ecological systems in the present study efficient removal of clp was achieved by thermo activated persulfate among which sulfate radical was identified as the predominant oxidizing species responsible for the decontamination based on high resolution lc ms derivatization method and density functional theory dft computation the detailed oxidation pathways and mechanisms were proposed the primary oxidation pathways included dechlorination hydroxylation decarboxylation and the formation of quinone like moieties afterwards numerous intermediate byproducts ranging from high molecular to very small ones were identified suggesting the pyridine ring was damaged during the thermo activated persulfate process the detected products containing six and five carbons indicated the pyridine ring cleavage would take place on the quinone structure intermediate further oxidation could continue by breaking each bond on the ring cleavage product yielding a series of short chain carbonyl chemicals carboxylic acids and inorganic ions in addition the presence of dissolved oxygen do was favorable to clp degradation indicating do played an important role in applying such technology the degradation rate constants of clp increased appreciably with increasing temperature and acidic ph facilitated the clp degradation the results obtained in this work would increase our understanding on the environmental fates of nitrogen heterocyclic compounds during sulfate radical so4 based

effectively eliminate contaminants in waters fang et al 2012 so4 e0 2 5 3 1 v is able to oxidize many organic compounds thermodynamically feasible with a second order rate constant ranging from 106 to

associated hazard to human health and ecosystems liao et al 2013 stapleton et al 2010 pyridine and its derivatives are normally used as chemical intermediates in the fabrication of pesticides herbicides and pharmaceuticals dell arciprete et al 2007 such chemicals could be released into the environment as a consequence of their widespread use as well as be discharged from urban and industrial effluents padoley et al 2008 clopyralid 3 6 dichhoropyridine 2 carboylic acid clp is a selective herbicide from the chemical class of pyridine compounds and it is normally used to control broad leaf weeds in certain crops abramovic et al 2007 clp presents high water solubility 1000 mg l 1 xu et al 2013 and is environmentally stable with a half life time up to 11 months ebato et al 2015 moreover due to its chemical activity it can penetrate through the soil causing a long term contamination of underground water and surface water corredor et al 2006 in north america concentrations up to 1050 ng l 1 clp were detected in reservoirs fed by snowmelt and rainfall runoff donald et al 2007a clp is hazardous to some endangered plant species and toxic to mammals for instance research studies have shown that clp was evaluated for teratogenic potential in rats hayes et al 1984 also clp spray drifts to sensitive agricultural areas such as potatoes may result in lost yields and economic losses wall 1994 clp is among most abundant chemicals that can be detected in drinking water donald et al 2007b and makes a potential threat to human health as well as ecological systems therefore efforts are needed for a complete removal or at least reduction of its level during the past years various advanced oxidation processes aops have been reported for the removal of clp or its structurally similar chemicals berberidou et al 2016 semitsoglou tsiapou et al 2016 tizaoui et al 2011 such aops can accomplish partial or total degradation of clp while complete mineralization of the reaction solutions is assumed to be unreachable most of past studies have focused on the concentration decrease of the target contaminants and the identification of the main oxidation products nevertheless it has been reported that for the photo degradation of clp a series of short chain carboxylic acids and inorganic ions were detected indicating the occurrence of ring opening reactions xu et al 2013 similar ring cleavage oxidations were also found in the work of westphal et al 2013 where maleic oxalic and oxamic acids as well as chloride were detected and gradually increased with time in the homogeneous fenton reaction recently studies found the pyridine ring break could also take place on the ortho quinone or the ortho hydroxyl structure intermediate for instance li et al 2016 have reported that during the oxidation of 2 3 dihydroxy pyridine an ortho quinone like structure intermediate were observed then further oxidation would take place to form open ring products a similar result was also obtained by zhang et al 2014 who found that ring opening oxidation occurs at the ortho position these findings suggest that clp transformation by ring cleavage and the formation of quinone like products might be important degradation pathways however activation and ultimately destruction of the strong bonds present in pyridine n heterocycles is a significant challenge and our knowledge of the details of the clp chemical processes that involve pyridine ring opening remains limited hence the goal of this study was to investigate the detailed mechanism of clp degradation by reaction with so4 which was generated by using thermo activated ps our main objectives were 1 to identify the primary and secondary carbonyl oxidation products and to propose transformation pathways of clp by sulfate radical 2 based on that to further clarify clp pyridine ring opening process and mechanism 3 finally to evaluate the oxidation efficiency for the removal clp

shimadzu japan 2 4 computational method all the dft calculations were performed with the gaussian 09 package frisch et al 2009 the b3lyp hybrid exchange correlation functional was used for geometry

states to verify that they connect two corresponding minima in addition frontier electron densities feds of highest occupied molecular orbitals homo and lowest unoccupied molecular orbitals lumo were determined values of fed2 homo fed2 lumo were calculated to predict reaction sites for the addition of so4 zhou et al 2019 2 5 kinetic study in all the cases and in the different conditions the degradation of clp followed pseudo first order kinetics as described by eq 1 1 ln clp t clp 0 k obs t where k obs is the pseudo first order rate constant clp t represents the concentration of clp at the specific reaction time t and clp 0 is the initial concentration of clp 3 results and discussion 3 1 identification of major reactive species preliminary experiments showed that efficient degradation of clp could be achieved by thermo activated persulfate process under heating temperature at 50 c the removal of clp increased with increasing ps concentration fig s1 sm in accordance with most published works feng et al 2017 nie et al 2014 for example approximately 57 of clp was attenuated in the presence of 1 0 mm ps while more than 74 was removed after the same time period when the initial ps concentration was set at 2 0 mm it is generally accepted that sulfate radical and hydroxyl radical are responsible for the oxidation of clp in thermo activated ps process gao et al 2016 nie et al 2014 to obtain a detailed insight into the reaction pathway and mechanism of clp degradation specific scavengers namely ethanol etoh and tert butanol tba were introduced in the system to evaluate the contributions of ho and so4 zhou et al 2017 different reactivities of these scavengers towards ho and so4 were used to distinguish the dominant radical species in the reaction solutions eqs 2 5 2 etoh ho intermediates k 2 00 109 m 1s 1 3 etoh so4 intermediates k 4 65 107 m 1s 1 4 tba ho intermediates k 5 70 108 m 1s 1 5 tba so4 intermediates k 6 55 105 m 1s 1 in the presence of 2 mm ps at 60 c and ph of 6 0 10 mm phosphate buffer clp degraded at a rate constant of 2 25 10 2 min 1 after the addition of etoh 2 mm and tba 2 mm the decay rate decreased to 0 18 10 2 and 1 49 10 2 min 1 respectively fig s2 this result suggests that ho may play a secondary role in clp transformation it is worthwhile mentioning that etoh scavenges both ho and so4 while tba is a rather selective ho scavenger thus by postulating a quasi stationary state for ho and so4 one gets eqs 6 and 7 upon addition of tba added 6 r o h k o h c l p oh clp k 4 oh tba 7 r s o 4 k s o 4 c l p so 4 clp k 5 so 4 tba this allows the determination of ho and so4 and the degradation of clp can be written as follows 8 r c l p t b a k o h c l p oh clp k s o 4 c l p so 4 clp k o h c l p clp k o h c l p clp k 4 tba r o h k s o 4 c l p clp k s o 4 c l p clp k 5 tba r s o 4 using eq 8 we attempted to assess the contributions of ho and so4 to clp degradation the second order rate constant for clp with ho has been determined at 2 0 108 m 1s 1 semitsoglou tsiapou et al 2016 because the accurate rate constant for so4 with clp was not available herein we used the value for pyridine with so4 at 2 2 108 m 1s 1 therefore when tba clp 100 r clp tba is equal to 9 r c l p t b a 0 0035 r o h 0 77 r s o 4 and in the absence of tba r clp equals to 10 r c l p r o h r s o 4 as mentioned above the values of r clp tba and r clp were estimated at 2 25 10 2 and 2 14 10 2 min 1 respectively thus we can obtain the value of r oh at 0 21 10 3 min 1 indicating that the contribution of ho was quite limited and so4 was the predominant radical in our reaction therefore the following discussion will focus on the interaction of clp with so4 instead of ho 3 2 oxidation products identification 3 2 1 primary oxidation products identification by hr ms the oxidation products generated via reaction between clp and sulfate radicals were firstly identified with the spe hr ms technique using the ms data in negative mode as illustrated in table s2 sm the presence of a cl atom was confirmed by the two isotopic peaks at m and m 1 9971 the parent compound clp was identified firstly at the retention time rt of 1 85 min with m z at 189 9482 191 9450 and 193 9420 in negative mode following this procedure 3 different transformation products tps were identified from the total ion current chromatograms tic of spe enriched samples specifically at rt of 2 46 min tps with m z 205 9429 207 9400 and 209 9369 were identified as the hydroxylation product of clp tp 2 at 1 87 min a decarboxylated tp m z 145 9580 147 9550 and 149 9522 namely 2 5 dichloropyridine tp 1 was observed the last tp with m z of 161 95291 163 94997 and 165 94695 at 5 24 min was labelled as tp 3 which can be formed via hydroxylation of tp 1 or decarboxylation of tp 2 3 2 2 secondary carbonyl products identification by dnph derivatization in order to characterize possible carbonyl intermediates and especially the tps with small molecular weights such as carboxylated and carbonylated compounds using dnph 2 4 dinitrophenylhydrazine derivatization followed by analysis with hr ms was employed in the present study this method can trap carbonyl compounds and separate them from the other by products while the ms analysis is made necessary to get their molecular mass tafer et al 2016 specifically a series of oxidation byproducts were identified and all the detected molecules were oxygenated chemicals ranging from c6 c1 as seen in table 1 and in the detailed ms data shown in fig s3 and table s3 sm the structures given in tables 1 and s3 were proposed based on derivatization data uv absorption around 220 nm 260 nm and 360 nm as well as literature data if any in most cases the established structure listed here is just one eight groups of c6 and c5 tps tp 4 11 were detected in hr ms and some of them are proposed to bear quinone or quinone like structures before the cleavage of the pyridine ring three groups of oxidation products in negative mode were observed specifically tp 4 with m z 348 0222 exhibited three different peaks in the tic spectrum corresponding to three different positions of double bond coupling with dnph tp 4 was assigned as 4 hydroxy 3 6 dioxo 3 6 dihydropyridine 2 carboxylic acid in which two cl atoms on the pyridine ring were both initially substituted by oh groups followed by further oxidation to form the quinone structure similar 4 6 dihydroxypyridine 2 5 dione and 6 hydroxypyridine 2 5 dione exhibited significant peaks in tic and were labelled as tp 5 and tp 6 respectively among tp 4 to tp 6 byproducts tp 5 was the most abundant furthermore numerous carbonyl oxidation products were also detected in hr ms indicating a pyridine ring cleavage pathway tp 7 m z 350 0378 was labelled as the ring cleavage product with an ortho quinone structure tp 8 9 m z 322 0249 and tp 10 11 m z 338 0378 were also obvious products of pyridine ring opening from different positions but their signals in tic were relatively weaker than tp 4 6 otherwise five c4 and eight c3 tps were observed among which c3 products were more abundant than c4 a total of ten c2 and cl chemicals were detected and most of them are assigned as acids or aldehydes which are often regarded as end products in the extended oxidation of organic contaminants herrmann et al 1999 3 3 oxidation pathways and mechanisms 3 3 1 mechanisms of clp primary oxidation pathway on the basis of the hr ms and dft calculation results the degradation mechanism of clp oxidized by the sulfate radical was proposed as shown in fig 1 according to frontier orbital theory positions with higher values of fed2 homo fed2 lumo are more susceptible to electrophilic sulfate addition ji et al 2013 firstly in order to clarify the initial step in ps thermo activated oxidation that involves the clp molecule reacting with so4 we performed the dft calculations and the results are listed in table s4 sm for clp 2c and 3c positions possess higher fed2 homo fed2 lumo values and these positions are more likely to be attacked by so4 therefore for two tps oxidation by so4 and deprotonation can be proposed as seen in fig 2 the initial step was believed to be the sulfate addition on 2c and 3c positions to form the intermediates iii and iv respectively transition states i for iii ii for iv were found to have sulfate addition on the heterocyclic ring with energy barriers at 10 0 kcal mol from i to iii and 4 6 kcal mol from ii to iv respectively these two energy barriers were both easy to overcome in the heated reaction system 50 c however the formation of species ⅰ is thermodynamically less favorable due to its relatively higher energy level with respect to ⅱ thus sulfate addition on 2c is discussed in the following part more thoroughly after sulfate addition iv would undergo hydrolysis to produce vi via another transition state v with sulfate and hydroxyl addition the energy barrier for this process was not high 7 8 kcal mol and we expect that the excess energy in the reaction system is sufficient to overcome it then the attached sulfate is detached from the pyridine ring through the excited state vii yielding a radical cation tp 2 viii this process is barrierless viii is still unstable and could continue to react with another sulfate radical leading to the formation of tp 2 the process vi 1 1 kcal mol vii 1 7 kcal mol viii 23 0 kcal mol tp 2 106 6 kcal mol would not require additional energy and could take place spontaneously to summarize the dft calculation revealed that the initial step was an electron transfer from clp to so4 and a radical cation tp 2 could be formed which was prone to further reaction with so4 leading to the formation of tp 2 another possibility for this hydroxylation process is electron abstraction followed by reaction of the radical cation with water after deprotonation one gets the same species that would also be formed by radical ho addition that species can lose h by reaction with o2 giving the hydroxylated derivative the production of hydroxylated derivatives is a classic pathway of the sulfate radical attack on the benzene ring which is similar to the reaction of smx with so4 resulting in the production of hydroxylated smx ji et al 2015 these hydroxylation processes were also observed in the oxidation of 2 4 dichlorophenoxyacetic acid by so4 chen et al 2017 in addition under the attack of so4 decarboxylation could take place on tp 2 and clp yielding tp 3 and tp 1 respectively similar hydroxylation de chlorination and decarboxylation pathways and these three main products were also reported by semitsoglou tsiapou et al 2016 in the low pressure uv h2o2 system that operates through oh radicals as seen in fig 1 tp 1 and tp 2 might be processed through two different pathways to generate tp 4 to tp 6 the first possibility is to from the substitution of cl by a hydroxyl group and tp 4 tp 6 could be formed previous study under different conditions has reported a product formed by de chlorination and oh radical substitution on one of the two chlorine bearing pyridine rings sojic et al 2009 however this hypothesis was not supported by our experimental data mainly due to the intermediates formed by de chlorination and hydroxylated substitution not being detected in the present work this might be due to the quick transformation of these products preventing their accumulation to reach the detection limit another possibility is the multiple step oxidation of tp 1 and tp 2 to generate the quinone structure products tp 4 and tp 6 which also requires a de chlorination reaction these oxidation pathways were proposed mainly based on the dft calculations specifically similar to clp the initial step for the reaction of tp 1 with so4 would also be the sulfate addition process on 2c position fig s4 sm in this process a transition state with an easily overcome energy barrier of 4 6 kcal mol was estimated afterwards the sulfate adduct could combine with an oh and the release of cl would take place subsequently h abstraction on different positions and sulfate release would occur leading to the formation of two carbon centered radicals containing a carbonyl group depending on the h abstraction positions it should be noted that these two carbon centered radicals could convert into each other fig s5 sm afterwards the unstable carbon centered radical could further react with another so4 and finally produce tp 4 similar reactions might also take place on tp 2 to the best of our knowledge we reported for the first time the formation of these quinone structure products during thermo activated ps oxidation of clp notably direct evidences for the two proposed pathways were still lacking thus further analytical strategies for the identification of hydroxylated products as well as the carbon centered radicals are required to better clarify the underlying mechanisms 3 3 2 further oxidation clp is supposed to be oxidized sequentially and to generate a variety of new compounds heat activated degradation of organic pollutants usually leads to structure break and ultimately conversion into co2 and h2o which can be visualized by the decrease of toc the toc remained quite stable and only 17 9 of it was removed after 120 min by comparison 41 7 clp was degraded by using dnph derivatization followed by analysis with hr ms method we detected a series of short chain products containing different carbon atoms which may explain why the toc did not decrease based on the detection of intermediates and final small molecules a possible degradation mechanism of clp through a ring opening process was discussed in this section the nitrogen atom present in aromatic heterocyclic pyridine has an electron withdrawing effect and can lower the π charge density of the pyridine ring active species could induce an electrophilic reaction in pyridine oxidation by attacking ring positions with high electron density as an electron donating substituent the hydroxyl group could activate the pyridine ring which could be oxidized in the ortho position or meta position and further form quinone structures aramendía et al 2008 previous work found oxygen and hydroxylation were essential for the ring cleavage and it was widely agreed that a polyhydroxylated aromatic ring is more easily opened pang et al 2014 for instance jacob et al 1977 reported in the reaction of ho with benzene and oxygen in aqueous solution that benzene firstly transformed to phenol and then some small carboxylic acid products were observed as the degree of hydroxylation increased the pyridine ring can undergo further oxidation and cleavage therefore we speculate that ring opening easily occurred on hydroxylated products tp 4 to tp 6 in the present work several five carbon and four carbon aldehyde and carboxylic products obtained by loss of one carbon atom were detected by using dnph derivatization indicating pyridine damage during oxidation also short chain products such as carboxylic acids aldehydes were detected moreover the tp 7 was detected which is possibly obtained by fragmentation of an ortho quinone structure we proposed that the ring cleavage reaction was started from the quinone like intermediates take one of aliphatic compounds e 3 z carboxymethylene amino 3 hydroxyacrylic acid tp 10 as an example it still contained five carbon atoms and one nitrogen atom although it was identified with some uncertainty its formation could result from the ring opening of tp 6 and tp 5 as seen in fig 3 tp 10 could undergo oxidative each bond cleavage and the ring cleavage products could again oxidize when the 2 3 bond of tp 10 is broken it is expected to generate formic acid tp 33 and tp 12 which has four carbons and an aldehyde group that will be further oxidized to a carboxyl group leading to the formation of tp 14 similarly after 4 5 bond cleavage we got a product which was unstable and further oxidized to form tp 13 the oxidation of tp 10 could also take place by 1 2 bond cleavage which would give acetic acid and its corresponding carboxylated products tp 17 and tp 19 however we didn t detect acetic acid directly but its oxidation products 2 oxoacetic acid tp 29 was observed when the cleavage occurred on the 1 6 bond we detected the direct products 3 oxopropanoic acid tp 16 and 2 iminoacetic acid tp 27 as well as malonic acid tp 23 which was further oxidized by tp16 when the 5 6 bond breaks the pyridine ring was broken up into small compounds namely tp 18 which contained amino groups as well as tp 29 among all the by products detected by using dnph derivatization formaldehyde tp 32 was the most abundant as seen from fig s6 formation of tp 32 gradually increased with oxidation time and reached a maximum at around 60 min after which a slight decline was started 3 4 reaction kinetics 3 4 1 impact of oxygen dissolved oxygen do is one of the most important components in natural water and recent studies have assessed its influence on so4 mediated oxidation of organic micro pollutants the impact of do mainly depends on the generation of so4 ultimately influencing the degradation efficiency and pathways of organic contaminants beylerian et al 2002 criquet and leitner 2015 liu et al 2016 for instance tan et al 2013 reported the degradation rate of antipyrine decreased with the increasing concentration of do this is mainly due to the sulfate radical is shifted to persulfate ion under anaerobic condition eq 11 14 moreover liu et al 2016 found that radical chain reactions were strongly affected by do whereas from a theoretical point of view do has the potential to accelerate the so4 induced oxidation by decreasing the energy barrier zhang et al 2018 11 o 2 e a q o 2 12 s 2 o 8 2 2 h 2 o h o 2 2 s o 4 2 3 h 13 h o 2 s 2 o 8 2 s o 4 s o 4 2 h o 2 14 2 s 2 o 8 2 2 h 2 o 3 s o 4 2 s o 4 o 2 4 h thus experiments were carried out to determine the impact of sr aops on clp degradation under anaerobic and aerobic conditions as seen in fig 4 a the control experiments showed a fast degradation of clp with a rate constant of 0 0205 min 1 in the absence of oxygen the rate constant decreased to 0 0055 min 1 these data show a beneficial impact of the presence of oxygen on the degradation of clp indicating do is involved somewhere in the reaction pathway in order to clarify the oxygen involved mechanisms a possible minor degradation pathway for tp 1 is proposed in scheme 1 the lone electron on the clp oh ring is attacked by do to generate clp oh o2 that is unstable therefore after a hoo dissociation the formation of tp 1 could be achieved for so4 induced oxidation in the absence of do two sulfate radicals are required for the formation of one clp oh fig 1 in the presence of do the production of one molecule of clp oh would consume one so4 and one molecule of oxygen therefore the presence of oxygen increases the efficiency of the formation of tp 1 as well as the degradation of clp these results suggest that oxygen is very important in sr aops and this technology should be used under aerobic conditions 3 4 2 temperature effects temperature normally plays a critical role in the thermo activated ps degradation process fig 4 b shows that increasing temperature led to higher k obs values which is consistent with degradation of other contaminants by the thermo activated process manz and carter 2017 waldemer et al 2007 the k obs value of clp increased from 0 3 10 3 min 1 at 303 k to 3 29 10 2 min 1 at 333 k higher temperature could accelerate the decomposition of ps and enhance the formation of sulfate radical which in turn facilitates the oxidation of the target compounds johnson et al 2008 15 ln k obs lna e a rt the temperature dependence of kobs was further evaluated with the arrhenius equation eq 15 where a is the pre exponential factor ea is the apparent activation energy kj mol 1 r is the universal gas constant 8 314 j mol 1k 1 and t is the absolute temperature the results suggested a linear relationship between ln kobs and 1 t and from the slope value of the line the activation energy of clp was determined to be 140 0 kj mol 1 3 4 3 effect of ph fig 4 c shows the clp degradation under different ph values at 50 c in the presence of 2 mm ps 10 mm phosphate buffer stock solutions were added to each reaction solution to obtain the desired ph value due to the phosphate buffer the change of solution ph was negligible while the solution ph without buffers gradually decreased from 5 2 to an acidic value of 4 2 4 8 after 2 h also the scavenging effect of phosphate species on so4 was considered as minimal in the present work gao et al 2016 with the increase of solution ph clp degradation was inhibited the kobs of clp decreased from 1 2 10 2min 1 to 7 6 10 3 5 1 10 3 5 0 10 3min 1 and 1 8 10 3 min 1 as the solution ph increased from 4 82 to 6 10 7 15 7 95 and 10 19 respectively neutral clp is the leading form under acidic ph values while anionic clp is the predominant form at basic conditions the removal efficiency is highly ph dependent and acidic conditions are more favorable for clp degradation similar results were also obtained in photo degradation photocatalytic degradation and fenton reactions of clp berberidou et al 2016 westphal et al 2013 xu et al 2013 the following pathways may contribute to this result first according to the nernstian equation the redox potential of so4 is higher at acidic ph which may increase the k obs cai et al 2018 furthermore under alkaline conditions the mineralization of clp may produce some bicarbonate and carbonate ions that can inhibit the oxidation processes qian et al 2018 lipczynska kochany et al 1995 documented that the oxidation rate of 4 chlorophenol by ho in the fenton reaction was inhibited by various anions such as sulfate ion and bicarbonate 4 conclusion in the present work thermo activated ps oxidation of aqueous clp was systematically investigated the efficient elimination of clp could be achieved by thermo activated persulfate and clp degradation followed pseudo first order reaction kinetics by the use of chemical scavengers so4 was identified as the predominant oxidizing species responsible for clp degradation primary byproducts were identified by hr ms and the transformation pathway included dechlorination hydroxylation and decarboxylation as well as the formation of quinone like moieties afterwards numerous intermediate byproducts ranging from high molecular weight to very small were identified by making use of dnph derivatization methods the detected short chain carboxylic acids aldehyde like compounds and inorganic ions indicated the pyridine ring was fragmented during the activated ps oxidation process based on the detected products containing six and five carbons we concluded the pyridine ring cleavage process would take place on the quinone structure intermediate by using the model compound tp 10 it was proved that the ring cleavage products could continue oxidizing by oxidative bond implications of thermo activated ps process to water treatment were further evaluated by investigating the controlling factors specifically increasing the temperature significantly enhanced the degradation of clp the oxidation of clp appeared to be highly ph dependent and higher ph showed inhibitory effects in the absence of do the rate constant decreased significantly indicating oxygen plays an important role in applying such technology formaldehyde concentration was found extremely high after 120 min reaction time and the toc remained quite stable because of the volatility and toxicity of formaldehyde it may become a potential atmospheric pollutant we concluded that heat activated ps was an efficient approach to eliminate clp in water but insufficient reaction time will result in incomplete degradation and formation of potential pollutants practical application of this technology under environmentally realistic condition should be investigated further because naturally existing constituents may have deep impacts on clp degradation the results of this work could help better understand clp fate during sr aops treatment declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal
