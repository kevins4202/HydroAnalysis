3500,streamflow variability is affected by both climate change and direct human impacts within the catchment quantification of the role of these two factors have significant implications for water resources in recent years budyko based analytical methods have been widely used for such quantification due to their simplicity and efficacy this paper presents a comparison of such methods to attribute changes in streamflow in four model parameter estimation experiment mopex catchments in the contiguous united states further a new improved two stage decomposition method to separate the role of climate and catchment changes on streamflow is proposed considering the uncertainty in the catchment parameter that further leads to a range of evaporative index values within a catchment we find that climate and catchment effects are sensitive to the choice of budyko equation disaggregation algorithm and approximation technique further the catchment parameter can be expressed probabilistically to account for the uncertainty because of limited hydro meteorological records the proposed approach employs a bootstrap analysis to obtain the stochastic range of the catchment parameter considering different choices of budyko equations we argue that rather than relying on a single budyko based approach for separation of climate and catchment effects on streamflow the proposed method offers a more robust way by considering the entire range of uncertainty of the catchment parameter keywords climate change catchment change budyko framework streamflow decomposition method sensitivity method bootstrap 1 introduction hydrologic processes in river basins are primarily governed by atmospheric mechanisms both large scale and regional the local topography and land use characteristics in the catchment acharya et al 2012 houghton 1996 werth and avissar 2002 the change in streamflow due to changes in precipitation and or temperature is classified as the climate change effect while that due to changes in catchment activities such as human settlements construction of barriers regulations of flow and vegetation changes that impact the streamflow directly constitute the catchment change effect on streamflow disaggregating the influence of climate and catchment effects on streamflow is necessary for answering important questions on regional environmental changes and subsequent impacts on present and future water availability dey and mishra 2017 ma et al 2008 wang et al 2013 zhang et al 2008 several methods are available for separating the individual impacts of climate change and catchment activities on streamflow variability these techniques can be broadly classified as methods based on physical processes such as hydrologic modeling arnell 1999 li et al 2009 liu et al 2013 ma et al 2009 field experiments such as paired catchment methods huang et al 2003 liu et al 2004 and conceptual reasoning such as climate elasticity roderick and farquhar 2011 sankarasubramanian et al 2001 and decomposition methods liang et al 2013 wang and hejazi 2011 hydrologic modeling follows a bottom up approach for capturing physical processes taking place within the hydrological cycle but this approach requires a large amount of data vieux 2001 paired catchment methods on the other hand identify impacts on flow characteristics by comparing two catchments with similar physical properties such as catchment area soil type and vegetation cover loon et al 2019 however this approach is limited to the availability of an ideal reference catchment for comparison liu et al 2004 unlike these approaches methods based on conceptual reasoning have the potential advantage of capturing the hydrological processes without focussing individually on the different physical mechanisms they follow a top down approach that attempts to model catchment properties as a function of observed data wang et al 2016 many conceptual reasoning based techniques rely on the simple proportionality between streamflow and precipitation modelled either as ratios or via regression without physically accounting for the water balance gao et al 2011 sankarasubramanian et al 2001 zhao et al 2014 zheng et al 2009 conceptual methods based on budyko framework overcome this limitation and model the link between supply precipitation and demand potential evapotranspiration using a class of equations known as the budyko based equations this framework is widely preferred for its simplicity and effectiveness jiang et al 2015 liang et al 2015 ning et al 2018 wang and hejazi 2011 wang and tang 2014 xin et al 2019 yang and yang 2011 the budyko framework assumes that the ratio of actual evapotranspiration e to precipitation p is a function of the aridity index that is the ratio of potential evapotranspiration ep to precipitation while also assuming the net storage change to be zero budyko 1974 ol dekop 1911 pike 1964 schreiber 1904 turc 1954 1 e p f e p p this relationship was later appended to include a catchment parameter denoted by c m n w o r Îµ in different studies viz choudhury 1999 fu chinese 1981 wang and tang 2014 yang et al 2008 zhang et al 2004 table 1 presents the different budyko equations based on the different generating functions the catchment parameter is represented in table 1 using different notations for the different equations in their original form for the rest of the present paper we use m to denote the catchment parameter to maintain uniformity the parametric budyko based equations can be written as follows 2 e p f e p p m budyko based approaches for disaggregation of climate and catchment change contributions to streamflow change are broadly classified under sensitivity and decomposition methods while the sensitivity method involves obtaining the total differential of streamflow as a sum of its partial derivatives roderick farquhar 2011 the decomposition method wang and hejazi 2011 uses the relative positions of the watershed on the budyko curve in the pre and post change periods to quantify individual effects of climate and catchment changes on streamflow previous studies have used a single type of decomposition method and validated the results with a single type of elasticity method gao et al 2016 jiang et al 2015 liang et al 2015 ning et al 2018 wang and hejazi 2011 several studies have also assessed climate catchment change contributions by using different budyko equations in a single type of climate elasticity method jiang et al 2015 wu et al 2017 considering the fact that these different budyko based disaggregation methods have their individual strengths and limitations it is important that a comprehensive comparative analysis be taken up and the uncertainty arising from the choice of a method approximation technique or budyko equation be quantified further all the studies listed above consider the catchment parameter m as a deterministic quantity fixed for a catchment for a particular period though the catchment parameter has no a priori physical meaning associated to it it has been shown to be affected by changing climate and catchment properties greve et al 2014 greve et al 2015 leading to a range of evaporative index values gudmundsson et al 2016 in addition the estimation of the catchment parameter m is uncertain because of limited hydro meteorological record length guo et al 2019 further the parametric budyko equations are non equivalent functional forms of each other and thus may contradict each other in terms of evaporative index values while following a constant parameter trajectory reaver et al 2020 effects of uncertainty on disaggregating climate and catchment effects on streamflow change within the budyko framework arising due to non uniqueness nature of catchment parameter while following constant parameter trajectory has not been explored in past studies also the procedural advantages and limitations arising from each method has to be understood for obtaining reliable estimates of climate and catchment changes therefore in the present study each of the method has been classified individually based on the type of approximation and disaggregation technique the study alleviates a new probabilistic approach to quantify uncertainty arising from different budyko equations choice of disaggregation and approximation techniques to address these gaps this study aims at the following objectives 1 a comparative assessment of budyko based methods for disaggregation of climate and catchment effects on streamflow change and their sensitivity to the choice of different budyko equations and approximation techniques 2 to understand the effect of the stochastic uncertainty of the catchment parameter on disaggregation of climate and catchment effects on streamflow using a bootstrap algorithm 3 to propose a new robust method for such disaggregation based on the entire uncertainty range of the evaporative index this method finds an optimized non parametric budyko curve for the pre and post change period of the catchment and finally 4 to compare the performance of the proposed method with respect to existing budyko based methods for disaggregation of climate and catchment effects on streamflow change four model parameter estimation experiment mopex catchments in the contiguous united states are chosen for this analysis 2 methodologies 2 1 model description fig 1 shows an overall schematic of the study the first step towards segregating climate and catchment effects on streamflow is to determine a changepoint in the long term streamflow time series streamflow measured at the outlet of a catchment is obtained after all the major abstractions post precipitation therefore the streamflow is inherent to the catchment and climate effects thus the studies on the budyko framework focuses on finding the change point based on streamflow following which the rank based non parametric pettitt s changepoint test pettitt 1979 is performed on the long term streamflow series gao et al 2016 guo et al 2019 liang et al 2015 wang hejazi 2011 zhao et al 2014 zhang et al 2008 to split the series into pre change period 1 and post change period 2 time periods the change point detection test is done for the four catchments for a significance level of 0 05 and it is observed that all the four catchments show significant change points we have used three budyko based equations namely budyko fu budyko cy and budyko wt the budyko zh equation is not used in this study since it is not able to satisfy the budyko state space for the energy limit condition for catchment lying in humid regions yang et al 2008 the catchment parameter m is estimated from the known values of potential evapotranspiration ep precipitation p and streamflow q averaged over period 1 and period 2 the influence of climate and catchment change activities on streamflow are quantified using different disaggregation methods the one stage roderick and farquhar 2011 and two stage jiang et al 2015 sensitivity methods and the one stage yang et al 2014 and two stage patterson et al 2013 wang and hejazi 2011 decomposition methods uncertainty in the catchment parameter is assessed by applying the bootstrap resampling technique to sets of values of ep p and q for period 1 and period 2 this uncertainty due to the stochastic nature of the catchment parameter as well as due to the choice of budyko equations lead to a range of uncertainty in the evaporative index for each catchment for period 1 and period 2 based on this range of uncertainty in the evaporative index the upper and lower limits of climate and catchment contributions to streamflow are obtained further we propose a new improved two stage decomposition method considering the median of the ensemble of evaporative index values 2 2 budyko based disaggregation techniques to separate climate and catchment effects on streamflow the sensitivity method of separation of climate and catchment effects on streamflow follows the concept of obtaining the total differential of a variable streamflow in this case as a sum of its partial derivatives roderick farquhar 2011 the concept of decomposition method was introduced by wang and hejazi 2011 in this method the contribution of climate and catchment change activities on streamflow is estimated based upon the relative positions of the watershed on the budyko curve from position 1 to position 2 as shown in fig 2 see fig 3 2 2 1 one stage sensitivity method in this approach the partial rate of change of streamflow q with respect to each of the drivers namely precipitation p potential evapotranspiration ep and catchment parameter m yields the streamflow sensitivities to the respective drivers roderick farquhar 2011 which are then separately quantified into climate Î´ q climate and catchment change components Î´ q catchment 3 q p 1 e p using eq 2 q p 1 f n 4 the first order approximation of the total differential of equation 4 gives 5 dq q p d p q e p d e p q n d n following previous studies the infinitesimal changes dq d p d e p a n d d n are replaced by their respective absolute changes Î´ q Î´ p Î´ e p a n d Î´ n gudmundsson et al 2016 renner and bernhofer 2012 from eq 5 the separate contributions of climate Î´ q climate and catchment Î´ q catchment effects to change in streamflow are estimated as 6 Î´ q climate q p Î´ p q e p Î´ e p 7 Î´ q catchment q n Î´ n where Î´ q q 2 q 1 Î´ p p 2 p 1 Î´ e p e p 2 e p 1 and Î´ q Î´ q climate Î´ q catchment here subscripts 1 and 2 refer to period 1 and period 2 respectively it has been reported that using the taylor series expansion up to first order as in eq 5 can yield results that are slightly different from the actual estimates yang et al 2014 with larger errors for catchment effects q n as compared to the climate effects q p q e p therefore the catchment contributions to streamflow change is calculated as the difference between the total streamflow change and the climate contribution given as gao et al 2016 liang et al 2015 8 Î´ q catchment Î´ q q p Î´ p q e p Î´ e p the intervals of Î´ p and Î´ e p can sometimes be large leading to erroneous climate contributions to streamflow jiang et al 2015 yang et al 2014 this limitation is overcome in the two stage sensitivity method described below 2 2 2 two stage sensitivity method the two stage sensitivity method follows the same principle as that of the one stage sensitivity method but instead of the rate of change in q with respect to p and ep over the entire period the average rate of change for period 1 and period 2 is used jiang et al 2015 for the computations 9 Î´ q climate 1 2 q p 1 q p 2 Î´ p 1 2 q e p 1 q e p 2 Î´ e p and Î´ q catchment Î´ q Î´ q climate 10 the two stage sensitivity method can also be used to get the lower and upper limits of the climate catchment change impact on streamflow by using only one rate of change i e q p 1 o r q p 2 at a time in eq 9 it has also been shown that using first order approximation techniques for estimating the catchment contribution to streamflow relative to climate change as given by eq 10 yield results that are comparable to that of the complementary approach of estimating catchment and climate change contributions separately zhou et al 2016 thus justifying the suitability of the two stage sensitivity method for estimation of the lower and upper limit of climate catchment change contribution to streamflow however the two stage sensitivity method is limited by the first order approximation error yang et al 2014 which may be overcome by the decomposition methods 2 2 3 one stage decomposition method the one stage decomposition method involves quantifying the climate contributions to streamflow based on the relative positions of the catchment on the budyko curve as shown in fig 2a accordingly from known values of the long term mean aridity index e p p and the average streamflow q of the catchment the catchment parameter is tuned to fit each of the budyko equations given in table 1 thereafter the budyko curve is plotted for the obtained catchment parameter for the mean value of e p p fig 2a here e p and p represent the climate variables therefore any change in aridity index of the catchment is only due to climate change activities and the catchment follows the budyko curve while moving in the horizontal direction on the other hand the divergence of the catchment from the budyko curve will denote the change in streamflow due to catchment activities this is because of the change in actual evapotranspiration caused by catchment activities to separate the climate and catchment change impact on streamflow yang et al 2014 proposed a modified decomposition approach as shown in fig 2a in this method the catchment parameter is determined by considering the mean values of aridity and evaporative index for the entire data period position 1 of the catchment is determined by aridity value of the catchment for the entire data period used in the study while position 2 of the catchment is determined by adding the change in the aridity value to the long term mean aridity value determined for position 1 climate and catchment contributions to streamflow are estimated as follows 11 q p 1 e p 12 q p 1 f e p p n since the catchment is assumed to move on a single path the catchment parameter n is fixed and climate variables e p and p is allowed to vary 13 Î´ q climate f e p Î´ e p p Î´ p f e p p 14 Î´ q catchment Î´ q Î´ q climate this method assumed the catchment to move along a single budyko curve not accounting for all possible changes in the catchment parameter and may thus result in misleading magnitudes of Î´ q climate using separate budyko curves for the pre and post change periods as used in the two stage decomposition method can overcome this limitation 2 2 4 two stage decomposition method the two stage decomposition method fig 2b involves estimation of the catchment parameter for the pre and post change conditions separately patterson et al 2013 the mean aridity index evaporative index pair for the pre change state of the catchment is plotted at position 1 and that of the post change state is plotted at position 2 both the paths i e 1 2 2 and 1 1 2 are feasible for a catchment to traverse in two stage decomposition method as shown in fig 2b the average change in streamflow from these paths give the catchment contributions to change in streamflow as shown below 15 Î´ q catchment 1 2 2 p 2 e 2

1 2 2 Î´ q 1 1 2 2 2 3 uncertainty in the evaporative index value here the nonparametric bootstrap resampling method kybic and nieuwenhuis 2011 guo et al 2019 is used to obtain the uncertainty in the catchment parameter for the pre change period we generate 10 000 sets of p q and ep values from the pre change period annual records for each such set average p q and ep values are obtained for the pre change period then each set is used to generate a catchment parameter for each of the three budyko equations then for each budyko equation we fit an empirical distribution to the generated catchment parameter values and use the 5th and 95th percentile values of that distribution to obtain the limits of evaporative index for each possible aridity index values theoretically zero to infinity the minimum and maximum values of the evaporative index obtained based on the different budyko equations give the range of uncertainty of evaporative index values as shown in fig 2c similar procedure is followed to obtain the range of uncertainty of evaporative index values for the post change period then the two stage decomposition method is applied using the lower and upper limits of the evaporative index values at the aridity index values of period 1 and period 2 for that catchment 2 4 proposed method based on the above discussion it is clear that the two stage decomposition method is the most robust against errors and approximations however the non uniqueness of the budyko equations and the stochastic nature of the catchment parameter lead to a range of uncertainty in the evaporative index that must be considered in this method for a reliable quantification of climate and catchment contributions to streamflow change in the proposed method we consider this range of uncertainty in the evaporative index values estimated as explained above in section 2 3 the range of evaporative index values corresponding to all possible aridity index values as shown in fig 2c are derived from any one of the budyko equations therefore each trajectory in the ensemble shown in fig 2c for period 1 or period 2 automatically follows the water and energy limits in the budyko state space the movement of catchment from upper limit of evaporative index in period 1 to upper limit in period 2 is estimated using two stage decomposition method to obtain the upper bound of climate catchment change similarly the lower bound is estimated and the probabilistic range for change in climate catchment contribution is shown in table 3 since each trajectory within this uncertainty range is a possible representation of the catchment in period 1 or period 2 the median of the band for each period is considered to determine the location of the catchment in period 1 and period 2 this ensures a realistic movement of the catchment along feasible trajectories in the budyko space resulting in reasonable changes in the evaporative index value Î´ e p 2 1 the median is a choice of representative behaviour of the uncertainty band of possible trajectories the trajectories defined by the different budyko equations are non unique reaver et al 2020 this implies that for catchments where the range of uncertainties in evaporative index for period 1 overlap with that of period 2 with any alternate representative measure such the mean the computed trajectories for period 1 and period 2 might cross each other the median avoids such non uniqueness thus the catchment is located along the median curve for period 1 and period 2 based on the pairs of its aridity and evaporative index values for the two periods respectively since the decomposition method is a graphical concept of the budyko framework one can apply this process without the use of any equation provided the trajectory is defined the two stage decomposition method is applied to the relative positions of the catchment along these median curves to obtain the climate and catchment change effects on streamflow as follows 19 e p 50 th p e r c e n t i l e f e p p 20 q p 1 e p 50 th p e r c e n t i l e 3 study area and dataset four large mopex catchments in the contiguous united states of america duan et al 2006 available at ftp hydrology nws noaa gov with aridity indices ranging from 1 to 4 and a minimum catchment area of 8500 sqkm are chosen for this study these catchments are denoted as non referenced catchments in the geospatial attributes of gages for evaluating streamflow gages ii dataset by falcone 2011 which substantiates the presence of human intervention the catchment details are provided in table 2 catchment 5430500 a rock river at rock county wisconsin state and catchment 6480000 b big sioux river at brookingscounty south dakota state have hydroelectric power plants and urban settlements on the upstreams while catchment 6860000 c smoky hill river at logancounty kansas state is characterized by irrigated agriculture catchment 8205500 d frio river at friocounty texas state is noted to have oil fields along with proximal irrigation falcone 2011 4 results and discussions streamflow is found to increase from period 1 to period 2 in all catchments except catchment c while precipitation increases in all the four catchments as shown in table 2 the potential evapotranspiration on the other hand is observed to remain unchanged thus it may be inferred that the climatic contribution to change in streamflow is entirely due to change in precipitation in this regard if an increase decrease in streamflow q due to climate change Î´ q climate is reflected as an increase decrease in the observed streamflow Î´ q as well it is referred to as a positive effect by climate change on streamflow on the other hand if the increase decrease in streamflow q by climate change corresponds to a decrease increase in the observed streamflow Î´ q it is referred to as negative effect by climate change Î´ q climate on streamflow and is reported accordingly with a negative sign the contribution of climate and catchment change effects on streamflow change calculated using the proposed method and the four sensitivity and decomposition methods for the three budyko based equations the catchment change impacts here are estimated relative to the climate change estimates Î´ q catchment Î´ q Î´ q climate except for the two stage decomposition method where the catchment changes are also estimated from the budyko curve wang and hejazi 2011 4 1 uncertainty in the budyko parameter the empirical distributions fitted to the generated catchment parameter values from the bootstrap resampling technique for each of the four catchments and for the three budyko equations are shown in fig 4 the figure shows the range of catchment parameter values spanned for different budyko equations for different state of each catchment in period 1 the range is obtained from the pairs of annual average values of p q and ep more diverse the combination more uncertainty will be seen in the catchment parameter values for a given catchment the value of the budyko parameter is determined from a fixed pair of values of aridity index and evaporative index from the range of generated pairs of aridity and evaporative indexes the range of the budyko parameter is obtained the catchment parameters can overlap each other as seen in fig 4 because these equations contradict each other while following a constant trajectory in each of their formulation reaver et al 2020 furthermore the width of uncertainty band depends upon the variability in the range of annual hydroclimatic variables that are used to derive the budyko parameters it is observed that the span of budyko wt catchment parameter is concentrated for catchments b c and d and more widespread for catchment a this is because of the smaller range of the budyko wt catchment parameter 0 1 as compared to budyko fu 1 and budyko cy 0 and its smaller sensitivity towards the water limit catchment a being more humid as compared to the other catchments lie towards the energy limit thereby showing a wider band in the probability density of the budyko wt parameter fig 4c the ensemble of trajectories in the budyko state space arising from the uncertainty in evaporative index values for the four catchments are shown in fig 5 a c e g the range of evaporative index at each aridity index value is denoted as the vertical distance fig 5 b d f h shows the value for the vertical distance at each aridity index value the figure also shows the maximum vertical distance and the vertical distance at the aridity index of the catchment marked in green and red respectively for period 1 it is observed from fig 5f and h that for arid catchments the uncertainty in evaporative index values initially increases and decreases sharply catchment c and catchment d on the other hand the uncertainty range in wetter catchments catchment a and catchment b that have aridity index 1 1 and 1 88 respectively continue to remain wide these results imply a greater significance of the uncertainty in evaporative index values in wetter catchments further the choice of budyko equation leads to largest sensitivity in the transition from wet to dry states yang et al 2008 zhou et al 2015 leading to largest uncertainty in the range of aridity index values of 1 4 to 2 4 the budyko parameter range depends upon the state of the catchment catchments a b c and d have runoff coefficients q p 1 e p as 0 22 0 03 0 01 and 0 01 respectively in period 1 the catchments with lower runoff coefficient will exhibit more uncertainty in the transition zone of budyko curve from humid to dry state as compared to catchment having higher runoff coefficient this is due to the asymptotic nature of the budyko curve the catchments with higher runoff coefficient are characterized by lower evaporative index values lying far from the horizontal line of water limit the catchments with higher runoff coefficient values will exhibit less uncertainty since the departure between the budyko curves arising from different parameter ranges would be low due to smooth transitioning from humid to dry state after which they eventually become asymptotic to the budyko limits on the other hand the catchments with lower runoff coefficient show a steep rise and fall in the uncertainty band due to quick transitioning from the humid to dry state accordingly the highest uncertainty in the catchments a b c and d are 0 052 0 07 0 13 and 0 11 respectively 4 2 climate and catchment effects on streamflow the contribution of climate and catchment effects on streamflow change obtained using the proposed method and the four sensitivity and decomposition methods for the three budyko based equations are shown in fig 6 the range of uncertainty of the catchment and climate change contributions shown in fig 6 is derived from the range of evaporative index values based on the 5th and 95th percentile values of the budyko paramater for each catchment in general results are sensitive to the aridity state of catchment the adopted disaggregation and approximation technique and the budyko equation used in catchment a and catchment b the rainfall and the streamflow are found to increase from the pre change period to the post change period suggestive of a positive effect from climate change on streamflow the relative contributions from the catchment change i e 35 3 and 65 7 in catchment a and catchment b respectively the numbers used from hereon for discussion are from the proposed method suggest an increase in streamflow majorly driven by climate change in catchment a while due to catchment characteristics in catchment b however the catchment change has certainly contributed for the increase in streamflow in both the catchments this increase is presumably due to urbanization and releases in river flows caused by hydroelectric power generation upstream of the catchment on the other hand for catchment c the decrease in streamflow from period 1 to period 2 along with a simultaneous increase in rainfall implies that the effects of climate and catchment change on streamflow act in opposite directions the percentage contribution to streamflow from climate change for catchment c is 18 for this catchment climate change has increased the streamflow although the observed streamflow is seen to decrease from period 1 to period 2 this observed decrease can be largely attributed to increased evapotranspiration on account of the irrigation activities in this catchment moreover the aridity index of this catchment is 3 44 indicating a dry catchment in such catchments the dependence of the catchment on climate variables is found to decrease and the catchment becomes more sensitive to catchment changes liang et al 2015 explaining the high catchment change contribution of 118 in streamflow for such catchment catchment d also shows a positive effect of climate change on streamflow this catchment has the largest variability in the contribution from climate catchment change on streamflow as compared to other catchments in addition to the resident land use characteristics this divergence is largely explained by a careful analysis of the position of the catchment on the budyko curve which in turn is governed by the aridity index of the catchment and the choice of the generating function zhou et al 2016 the aridity index of this catchment 2 27 table 2 implies that the catchment is in the transition phase between wet and dry states where the change in streamflow are highly sensitive to m and Ï yang et al 2008 zhou et al 2016 the ranges of climate and catchment change effects on streamflow obtained by the probabilistic framework are shown in table 3 with a few exceptions for catchment d the different disaggregation methods agree with each other for this catchment climate change effects for budyko fu one stage and budyko cy one stage decomposition method are 98 and 101 respectively much higher as compared to other methods this may happen in one stage methods where the elasticity of streamflow is high for a particular budyko equation and the change in magnitude of aridity index between period 2 and period 1 is also considerably large with the different parameter range values for every equation the uncertainty range of evaporative index at each aridity index keeps changing generally the elasticity of precipitation to streamflow for the budyko wt equation remains lower than the other two equations therefore the climate change contribution from the budyko wt equation remains lower as compared to other equations the probabilistic approach to separate the climate and catchment change effects on streamflow gives a range of values for each catchment table 3 the range of values shown in table 3 is calculated from the upper and lower bound of the trajectories obtained from different equations and ranges of budyko parameters further these ranges are able to capture the contribution values obtained by other disaggregation methods shown in fig 6 5 summary and conclusions climate and catchment change activities are major factors that can significantly alter streamflow in a catchment it is important to quantify the changes in streamflow due to these individual factors while formulating any development or restoration strategies for the catchment of interest the budyko based approaches are widely preferred to other alternatives for such quantification on account of their simplicity and effectiveness chang et al 2016 jiang et al 2015 liang et al 2015 xin et al 2019 in this study four budyko based disaggregation algorithms one stage sensitivity two stage sensitivity one stage decomposition and two stage decomposition methods are applied on four mopex catchments in the contiguous united states their performances are compared and their advantages and limitations are discussed three types of single parameter budyko equations are used for each disaggregating method the two stage decomposition method is noted to be the most robust disaggregation technique earlier studies focussing on separating the roles of climate and catchment changes on streamflow do not take into account the probabilistic nature of the catchment parameter neither consider the effect of the choice of budyko equation in this study we present a framework to quantify the uncertainty in evaporative index values arising from the stochasticity of the catchment parameter and from the choice of budyko equation and also propose an improved two stage decomposition method based on this uncertainty range a bootstrap resampling technique is used to arrive at the uncertainty range of evaporative index values the theoretical justification behind consideration of this uncertainty stems from the fact that the catchment can move along many possible paths from a pre change to a post change location in the budyko state space our results show that climate or catchment contributions to streamflow change may vary across a wide range depending on the aridity index and the elasticity of the catchment also wetter catchments are observed to be more prone to larger ranges of uncertainty in the evaporative index as compared to arid catchments in general we observe that climate or catchment effects are sensitive to the choice of disaggregation algorithms or of the budyko equation therefore the proposed method is more robust since it considers the range of uncertainty in the trajectory of the catchment rather than relying on a single method credit authorship

characteristics in the catchment acharya et al 2012 houghton 1996 werth and avissar 2002 the change in streamflow due to changes in precipitation and or temperature is classified as the climate change effect while that due to changes in catchment activities such as human settlements construction of barriers regulations of flow and vegetation changes that impact the streamflow directly constitute the catchment change effect on streamflow disaggregating the influence of climate and catchment effects on streamflow is necessary for answering important questions on regional environmental changes and subsequent impacts on present and future water availability dey and mishra 2017 ma et al 2008 wang et al 2013 zhang et al 2008 several methods are available for separating the individual impacts of climate change and catchment activities on streamflow variability these techniques can be broadly classified as methods based on physical processes such as hydrologic modeling arnell 1999 li et al 2009 liu et al 2013 ma et al 2009 field experiments such as paired catchment methods huang et al 2003 liu et al 2004 and conceptual reasoning such as climate elasticity roderick and farquhar 2011 sankarasubramanian et al 2001 and decomposition methods liang et al 2013 wang and hejazi 2011 hydrologic modeling follows a bottom up approach for capturing physical processes taking place within the hydrological cycle but this approach requires a large amount of data vieux 2001 paired catchment methods on the other hand identify impacts on flow characteristics by comparing two catchments with similar physical properties such as catchment area soil type and vegetation cover loon et al 2019 however this approach is limited to the availability of an ideal reference catchment for comparison liu et al 2004 unlike these approaches methods based on conceptual reasoning have the potential advantage of capturing the hydrological processes without focussing individually on the different physical mechanisms they follow a top down approach that attempts to model catchment properties as a function of observed data wang et al 2016 many conceptual reasoning based techniques rely on the simple proportionality between streamflow and precipitation modelled either as ratios or via regression without physically accounting for the water balance gao et al 2011 sankarasubramanian et al 2001 zhao et al 2014 zheng et al 2009 conceptual methods based on budyko framework overcome this limitation and model the link between supply precipitation and demand potential evapotranspiration using a class of equations known as the budyko based equations this framework is widely preferred for its simplicity and effectiveness jiang et al 2015 liang et al 2015 ning et al 2018 wang and hejazi 2011 wang and tang 2014 xin et al 2019 yang and yang 2011 the budyko framework assumes that the ratio of actual evapotranspiration e to precipitation p is a function of the aridity index that is the ratio of potential evapotranspiration ep to precipitation while also assuming the net storage change to be zero budyko 1974 ol dekop 1911 pike 1964 schreiber 1904 turc 1954 1 e p f e p p this relationship was later appended to include a catchment parameter denoted by c m n w o r Îµ in different studies viz choudhury 1999 fu chinese 1981 wang and tang 2014 yang et al 2008 zhang et al 2004 table 1 presents the different budyko equations based on the different generating functions the catchment parameter is represented in table 1 using different notations for the different equations in their original form for the rest of the present paper we use m to denote the catchment parameter to maintain uniformity the parametric budyko based equations can be written as follows 2 e p f e p p m budyko based approaches for disaggregation of climate and catchment change contributions to streamflow change are broadly classified under sensitivity and decomposition methods while the sensitivity method involves obtaining the total differential of streamflow as a sum of its partial derivatives roderick farquhar 2011 the decomposition method wang and hejazi 2011 uses the relative positions of the watershed on the budyko curve in the pre and post change periods to quantify individual effects of climate and catchment changes on streamflow previous studies have used a single type of decomposition method and validated the results with a single type of elasticity method gao et al 2016 jiang et al 2015 liang et al 2015 ning et al 2018 wang and hejazi 2011 several studies have also assessed climate catchment change contributions by using different budyko equations in a single type of climate elasticity method jiang et al 2015 wu et al 2017 considering the fact that these different budyko based disaggregation methods have their individual strengths and limitations it is important that a comprehensive comparative analysis be taken up and the uncertainty arising from the choice of a method approximation technique or budyko equation be quantified further all the studies listed above consider the catchment parameter m as a deterministic quantity fixed for a catchment for a particular period though the catchment parameter has no a priori physical meaning associated to it it has been shown to be affected by changing climate and catchment properties greve et al 2014 greve et al 2015 leading to a range of evaporative index values gudmundsson et al 2016 in addition the estimation of the catchment parameter m is uncertain because of limited hydro meteorological record length guo et al 2019 further the parametric budyko equations are non equivalent functional forms of each other and thus may contradict each other in terms of evaporative index values while following a constant parameter trajectory reaver et al 2020 effects of uncertainty on disaggregating climate and catchment effects on streamflow change within the budyko framework arising due to non uniqueness nature of catchment parameter while following constant parameter trajectory has not been explored in past studies also the procedural advantages and limitations arising from each method has to be understood for obtaining reliable estimates of climate and catchment changes therefore in the present study each of the method has been classified individually based on the type of approximation and disaggregation technique the study alleviates a new probabilistic approach to quantify uncertainty arising from different budyko equations choice of disaggregation and approximation techniques to address these gaps this study aims at the following objectives 1 a comparative assessment of budyko based methods for disaggregation of climate and catchment effects on streamflow change and their sensitivity to the choice of different budyko equations and approximation techniques 2 to understand the effect of the stochastic uncertainty of the catchment parameter on disaggregation of climate and catchment effects on streamflow using a bootstrap algorithm 3 to propose a new robust method for such disaggregation based on the entire uncertainty range of the evaporative index this method finds an optimized non parametric budyko curve for the pre and post change period of the catchment and finally 4 to compare the performance of the proposed method with respect to existing budyko based methods for disaggregation of climate and catchment effects on streamflow change four model parameter estimation experiment mopex catchments in the contiguous united states are chosen for this analysis 2 methodologies 2 1 model description fig 1 shows an overall schematic of the study the first step towards segregating climate and catchment effects on streamflow is to determine a changepoint in the long term streamflow time series streamflow measured at the outlet of a catchment is obtained after all the major abstractions post precipitation therefore the streamflow is inherent to the catchment and climate effects thus the studies on the budyko framework focuses on finding the change point based on streamflow following which the rank based non parametric pettitt s changepoint test pettitt 1979 is performed on the long term streamflow series gao et al 2016 guo et al 2019 liang et al 2015 wang hejazi 2011 zhao et al 2014 zhang et al 2008 to split the series into pre change period 1 and post change period 2 time periods the change point detection test is done for the four catchments for a significance level of 0 05 and it is observed that all the four catchments show significant change points we have used three budyko based equations namely budyko fu budyko cy and budyko wt the budyko zh equation is not used in this study since it is not able to satisfy the budyko state space for the energy limit condition for catchment lying in humid regions yang et al 2008 the catchment parameter m is estimated from the known values of potential evapotranspiration ep precipitation p and streamflow q averaged over period 1 and period 2 the influence of climate and catchment change activities on streamflow are quantified using different disaggregation methods the one stage roderick and farquhar 2011 and two stage jiang et al 2015 sensitivity methods and the one stage yang et al 2014 and two stage patterson et al 2013 wang and hejazi 2011 decomposition methods uncertainty in the catchment parameter is assessed by applying the bootstrap resampling technique to sets of values of ep p and q for period 1 and period 2 this uncertainty due to the stochastic nature of the catchment parameter as well as due to the choice of budyko equations lead to a range of uncertainty in the evaporative index for each catchment for period 1 and period 2 based on this range of uncertainty in the evaporative index the upper and lower limits of climate and catchment contributions to streamflow are obtained further we propose a new improved two stage decomposition method considering the median of the ensemble of evaporative index values 2 2 budyko based disaggregation techniques to separate climate and catchment effects on streamflow the sensitivity method of separation of climate and catchment effects on streamflow follows the concept of obtaining the total differential of a variable streamflow in this case as a sum of its partial derivatives roderick farquhar 2011 the concept of decomposition method was introduced by wang and hejazi 2011 in this method the contribution of climate and catchment change activities on streamflow is estimated based upon the relative positions of the watershed on the budyko curve from position 1 to position 2 as shown in fig 2 see fig 3 2 2 1 one stage sensitivity method in this approach the partial rate of change of streamflow q with respect to each of the drivers namely precipitation p potential evapotranspiration ep and catchment parameter m yields the streamflow sensitivities to the respective drivers roderick farquhar 2011 which are then separately quantified into climate Î´ q climate and catchment change components Î´ q catchment 3 q p 1 e p using eq 2 q p 1 f n 4 the first

respective absolute changes Î´ q Î´ p Î´ e p a n d Î´ n gudmundsson et al 2016 renner and bernhofer 2012 from eq 5 the separate contributions of climate Î´ q climate and catchment Î´ q catchment

here subscripts 1 and 2 refer to period 1 and period 2 respectively it has been reported that using the taylor series expansion up to first order as in eq 5 can yield results that are slightly different from the actual estimates yang et al 2014 with larger errors for catchment effects q n as compared to the climate effects q p q e p therefore the catchment contributions to streamflow change is calculated as the difference between the total streamflow change and the climate contribution given as gao et al 2016 liang et al 2015 8 Î´ q catchment Î´ q q p Î´ p q e p Î´ e p the intervals of Î´ p and Î´ e p can sometimes be large leading to erroneous climate contributions to streamflow jiang et al 2015 yang et al 2014 this limitation is overcome in the two stage sensitivity method described below 2 2 2 two stage sensitivity method the two stage sensitivity method follows the same principle as that of the one stage sensitivity method but instead of the rate of change in q with respect to p and ep over the entire period the average rate of change for period 1 and period 2 is used jiang et al 2015 for the computations 9 Î´ q climate 1 2 q p 1 q p 2 Î´ p 1 2 q e p 1 q e p 2 Î´

rate of change i e q p 1 o r q p 2 at a time in eq 9 it has also been shown that using first order approximation techniques for estimating the catchment contribution to streamflow relative to climate change as given by eq 10 yield results that are comparable to that of the complementary approach of estimating catchment and climate change contributions separately zhou et al 2016 thus justifying the suitability of the two stage sensitivity method for estimation of the lower and upper limit of climate catchment change contribution to streamflow however the two stage sensitivity method is limited by the first order approximation error yang et al 2014 which may be overcome by the decomposition methods 2 2 3 one stage decomposition method the one stage decomposition method involves quantifying the climate contributions to streamflow based on the relative positions of the catchment on the budyko curve as shown in fig 2a accordingly from known values of the long term mean aridity index e p p and the average streamflow q of the catchment the catchment parameter is tuned to fit each of the budyko equations given in table 1 thereafter the budyko curve is plotted for the obtained catchment parameter for the mean value of e p p fig 2a here e p and p represent the climate variables therefore any change in aridity index of the catchment is only due to climate change activities and the catchment follows the budyko curve while moving in the horizontal direction on the other hand the divergence of the catchment from the budyko curve will denote the change in streamflow due to catchment activities this is because of the change in actual evapotranspiration caused by catchment activities to separate the climate and catchment change impact on streamflow yang et al 2014 proposed a modified decomposition approach as shown in fig 2a in this method the catchment parameter is determined by considering the mean values of aridity and evaporative index for the entire data period position 1 of the catchment is determined by aridity value of the catchment for the entire data period used in the study while position 2 of the catchment is determined by adding the change in the aridity value to the long term mean aridity value determined for position 1 climate and catchment contributions to streamflow are estimated as follows 11 q p 1 e p 12 q p 1 f e p p n since the catchment is assumed to move on a single path the catchment parameter n is fixed and climate variables e p and p is allowed to vary 13 Î´ q climate f e p Î´ e p p Î´ p f e p p 14 Î´ q catchment Î´ q Î´ q climate this method assumed the catchment to move along a single budyko curve not accounting for all possible changes in the catchment parameter and may thus result in misleading magnitudes of Î´ q climate using separate budyko curves for the pre and post change periods as used in the two stage decomposition method can overcome this limitation 2 2 4 two stage decomposition method the two stage decomposition method fig 2b involves estimation of the catchment parameter for the pre and post change conditions separately patterson et al 2013 the mean aridity index evaporative index pair for the pre change state of the catchment is plotted at position 1 and that of the post change state is plotted at position 2 both the paths i e 1 2 2 and 1 1 2 are feasible for a catchment to traverse in two stage decomposition method as shown in fig 2b the average change in streamflow from these paths give the catchment contributions to change in streamflow as shown below 15 Î´ q catchment 1 2 2 p 2 e 2

catchment parameter for the pre change period we generate 10 000 sets of p q and ep values from the pre change period annual records for each such set average p q and ep values are obtained for the pre change period then each set is used to generate a catchment parameter for each of the three budyko equations then for each budyko equation we fit an empirical distribution to the generated catchment parameter values and use the 5th and 95th percentile values of that distribution to obtain the limits of evaporative index for each possible aridity index values theoretically zero to infinity the minimum and maximum values of the evaporative index obtained based on the different budyko equations give the range of uncertainty of evaporative index values as shown in fig 2c similar procedure is followed to obtain the range of uncertainty of evaporative index values for the post change period then the two stage decomposition method is applied using the lower and upper limits of the evaporative index values at the aridity index values of period 1 and period 2 for that catchment 2 4 proposed method based on the above discussion it is clear that the two stage decomposition method is the most robust against errors and approximations however the non uniqueness of the budyko equations and the stochastic nature of the catchment parameter lead to a range of uncertainty in the evaporative index that must be considered in this method for a reliable quantification of climate and catchment contributions to streamflow change in the proposed method we consider this range of uncertainty in the evaporative index values estimated as explained above in section 2 3 the range of evaporative index values corresponding to all possible aridity index values as shown in fig 2c are derived from any one of the budyko equations therefore each trajectory in the ensemble shown in fig 2c for period 1 or period 2 automatically follows the water and energy limits in the budyko state space the movement of catchment from upper limit of evaporative index in period 1 to upper limit in period 2 is estimated using two stage decomposition method to obtain the upper bound of climate catchment change similarly the lower bound is estimated and the probabilistic range for change in climate catchment contribution is shown in table 3 since each trajectory within this uncertainty range is a possible representation of the catchment in period 1 or period 2 the median of the band for each period is considered to determine the location of the catchment in period 1 and period 2 this ensures a realistic movement of the catchment along feasible trajectories in the budyko space resulting in reasonable changes in the evaporative index value Î´ e p 2 1 the median is a choice of representative behaviour of the uncertainty band of possible trajectories the trajectories defined by the different budyko equations are non unique reaver et al 2020 this implies that for catchments where the range of uncertainties in evaporative index for period 1 overlap with that of period 2 with any alternate representative measure such the mean the computed trajectories for period 1 and period 2 might cross each other the median avoids such non uniqueness thus the catchment is located along the median curve for period 1 and period 2 based on the pairs of its aridity and evaporative index values for the two periods respectively since the decomposition method is a graphical concept of the budyko framework one can apply this process without the use of any equation provided the trajectory is defined the two stage decomposition method is applied to the relative positions of the catchment along these median curves to obtain the climate and catchment change effects on streamflow as follows 19 e p 50 th p e r c e n t i l e f e p p 20 q p 1 e p 50 th p e r c e n t i l e 3 study area and dataset four large mopex catchments in the contiguous united states of america duan et al 2006 available at ftp hydrology nws noaa gov with aridity indices ranging from 1 to 4 and a minimum catchment area of 8500 sqkm are chosen for this study these catchments are denoted as non referenced catchments in the geospatial attributes of gages for evaluating streamflow gages ii dataset by falcone 2011 which substantiates the presence of human intervention the catchment details are provided in table 2 catchment 5430500 a rock river at rock county wisconsin state and catchment 6480000 b big sioux river at brookingscounty south dakota state have hydroelectric power plants and urban settlements on the upstreams while catchment 6860000 c smoky hill river at logancounty kansas state is characterized by irrigated agriculture catchment 8205500 d frio river at friocounty texas state is noted to have oil fields along with proximal irrigation falcone 2011 4 results and discussions streamflow is found to increase from period 1 to period 2 in all catchments except catchment c while precipitation increases in all the four catchments as shown in table 2 the potential evapotranspiration on the other hand is observed to remain unchanged thus it may be inferred that the climatic contribution to change in streamflow is entirely due to change in precipitation in this regard if an increase decrease in streamflow q due to climate change Î´ q climate is reflected as an increase decrease in the observed streamflow Î´ q as well it is referred to as a positive effect by climate change on streamflow on the other hand if the increase decrease in streamflow q by climate change corresponds to a decrease increase in the observed streamflow Î´ q it is referred to as negative effect by climate change Î´ q climate on streamflow and is reported accordingly with a negative

equations the catchment change impacts here are estimated relative to the climate change estimates Î´ q catchment Î´ q Î´ q climate except for the two stage decomposition method where the catchment changes are also estimated from the budyko curve wang and hejazi 2011 4 1 uncertainty in the budyko parameter the empirical distributions fitted to the generated catchment parameter values from the bootstrap resampling technique for each of the four catchments and for the three budyko equations are shown in fig 4 the figure shows the range of catchment parameter values spanned for different budyko equations for different state of each catchment in period 1 the range is obtained from the pairs of annual average values of p q and ep more diverse the combination more uncertainty will be seen in the catchment parameter values for a given catchment the value of the budyko parameter is determined from a fixed pair of values of aridity index and evaporative index from the range of generated pairs of aridity and evaporative indexes the range of the budyko parameter is obtained the catchment parameters can overlap each other as seen in fig 4 because these equations contradict each other while following a constant trajectory in each of their formulation reaver et al 2020 furthermore the width of uncertainty band depends upon the variability in the range of annual hydroclimatic variables that are used to derive the budyko parameters it is observed that the span of budyko wt catchment parameter is concentrated for catchments b c and d and more widespread for catchment a this is because of the smaller range of the budyko wt catchment parameter 0 1 as compared to budyko fu 1 and budyko cy 0 and its smaller sensitivity towards the water limit catchment a being more humid as compared to the other catchments lie towards the energy limit thereby showing a wider band in the probability density of the budyko wt parameter fig 4c the ensemble of trajectories in the budyko state space arising from the uncertainty in evaporative index values for the four catchments are shown in fig 5 a c e g the range of evaporative index at each aridity index value is denoted as the vertical distance fig 5 b d f h shows the value for the vertical distance at each aridity index value the figure also shows the maximum vertical distance and the vertical distance at the aridity index of the catchment marked in green and red respectively for period 1 it is observed from fig 5f and h that for arid catchments the uncertainty in evaporative index values initially increases and decreases sharply catchment c and catchment d on the other hand the uncertainty range in wetter catchments catchment a and catchment b that have aridity index 1 1 and 1 88 respectively continue to remain wide these results imply a greater significance of the uncertainty in evaporative index values in wetter catchments further the choice of budyko equation leads to largest sensitivity in the transition from wet to dry states yang et al 2008 zhou et al 2015 leading to largest uncertainty in the range of aridity index values of 1 4 to 2 4 the budyko parameter range depends upon the state of the catchment catchments a b c and d have runoff coefficients q p 1 e p as 0 22 0 03 0 01 and 0 01 respectively in period 1 the catchments with lower runoff coefficient will exhibit more uncertainty in the transition zone of budyko curve from humid to dry state as compared to catchment having higher runoff coefficient this is due to the asymptotic nature of the budyko curve the catchments with higher runoff coefficient are characterized by lower evaporative index values lying far from the horizontal line of water limit the catchments with higher runoff coefficient values will exhibit less uncertainty since the departure between the budyko curves arising from different parameter ranges would be low due to smooth transitioning from humid to dry state after which they eventually become asymptotic to the budyko limits on the other hand the catchments with lower runoff coefficient show a steep rise and fall in the uncertainty band due to quick transitioning from the humid to dry state accordingly the highest uncertainty in the catchments a b c and d are 0 052 0 07 0 13 and 0 11 respectively 4 2 climate and catchment effects on streamflow the contribution of climate and catchment effects on streamflow change obtained using the proposed method and the four sensitivity and decomposition methods for the three budyko based equations are shown in fig 6 the range of uncertainty of the catchment and climate change contributions shown in fig 6 is derived from the range of evaporative index values based on the 5th and 95th percentile values of the budyko paramater for each catchment in general results are sensitive to the aridity state of catchment the adopted disaggregation and approximation technique and the budyko equation used in catchment a and catchment b the rainfall and the streamflow are found to increase from the pre change period to the post change period suggestive of a positive effect from climate change on streamflow the relative contributions from the catchment change i e 35 3 and 65 7 in catchment a and catchment b respectively the numbers used from hereon for discussion are from the proposed method suggest an increase in streamflow majorly driven by climate change in catchment a while due to catchment characteristics in catchment b however the catchment change has certainly contributed for the increase in streamflow in both the catchments this increase is presumably due to urbanization and releases in river flows caused by hydroelectric power generation upstream of the catchment on the other hand for catchment c the decrease in streamflow from period 1 to period 2 along with a simultaneous increase in rainfall implies that the effects of climate and catchment change on streamflow act in opposite directions the percentage contribution to streamflow from climate change for catchment c is 18 for this catchment climate change has increased the streamflow although the observed streamflow is seen to decrease from period 1 to period 2 this observed decrease can be largely attributed to increased evapotranspiration on account of the irrigation activities in this catchment moreover the aridity index of this catchment is 3 44 indicating a dry catchment in such catchments the dependence of the catchment on climate variables is found to decrease and the catchment becomes more sensitive to catchment changes liang et al 2015 explaining the high catchment change contribution of 118 in streamflow for such catchment catchment d also shows a positive effect of climate change on streamflow this catchment has the largest variability in the contribution from climate catchment change on streamflow as compared to other catchments in addition to the resident land use characteristics this divergence is largely explained by a careful analysis of the position of the catchment on the budyko curve which in turn is governed by the aridity index of the catchment and the choice of the generating function zhou et al 2016 the aridity index of this catchment 2 27 table 2 implies that the catchment is in the transition phase between wet and dry states where the change in streamflow are highly sensitive to m and Ï yang et al 2008 zhou et al 2016 the ranges of climate and catchment change effects on streamflow obtained by the probabilistic framework are shown in table 3 with a few exceptions for catchment d the different disaggregation methods agree with each other for this catchment climate change effects for budyko fu one stage and budyko cy one stage decomposition method are 98 and 101 respectively much higher as compared to other methods this may happen in one stage methods where the elasticity of streamflow is high for a particular budyko equation and the change in magnitude of aridity index between period 2 and period 1 is also considerably large with the different parameter range values for every equation the uncertainty range of evaporative index at each aridity index keeps changing generally the elasticity of precipitation to streamflow for the budyko wt equation remains lower than the other two equations therefore the climate change contribution from the budyko wt equation remains lower as compared to other equations the probabilistic approach to separate the climate and catchment change effects on streamflow gives a range of values for each catchment table 3 the range of values shown in table 3 is calculated from the upper and lower bound of the trajectories obtained from different equations and ranges of budyko parameters further these ranges are able to capture the contribution values obtained by other disaggregation methods shown in fig 6 5 summary and conclusions climate and catchment change activities are major factors that can significantly alter streamflow in a catchment it is important to quantify the changes in streamflow due to these individual factors while formulating any development or restoration strategies for the catchment of interest the budyko based approaches are widely preferred to other alternatives for such quantification on account of their simplicity and effectiveness chang et al 2016 jiang et al 2015 liang et al 2015 xin et al 2019 in this study four budyko based disaggregation algorithms one stage sensitivity two stage sensitivity one stage decomposition and two stage decomposition methods are applied on four mopex catchments in the contiguous united states their performances are compared and their advantages and limitations are discussed three types of single parameter budyko equations are used for each disaggregating method the two stage decomposition method is noted to be the most robust disaggregation technique earlier studies focussing on separating the roles of climate and catchment changes on streamflow do not take into account the probabilistic nature of the catchment parameter neither consider the effect of the choice of budyko equation in this study we present a framework to quantify the uncertainty in evaporative index values arising from the stochasticity of the catchment parameter and from the choice of budyko equation and also propose an improved two stage decomposition method based on this uncertainty range a bootstrap resampling technique is used to arrive at the uncertainty range of evaporative index values the theoretical justification behind consideration of this uncertainty stems from the fact that the catchment can move along many possible paths from a pre change to a post change location in the budyko state space our results show that climate or catchment contributions to streamflow change may vary across a wide range depending on the aridity index and the elasticity of the catchment also wetter catchments are observed to be more prone to larger ranges of uncertainty in the evaporative index as compared to arid catchments in general we observe that climate or catchment effects are sensitive to the choice of disaggregation algorithms or of the budyko equation therefore the proposed method is more robust since it considers the range of uncertainty in the trajectory of the catchment rather than relying on a single method credit authorship

3501,recently the use of heat as a tracer to evaluate the process of leakage in embankment dams has attracted wide attention a more accurate flow heat coupling model of embankment dams could help us to better understand the patterns of water flow and heat transfer in embankment dams and provide a scientific basis for the seepage prevention and repair of these dams in this paper combined with thermal conductivity empirical models tcems the saturated unsaturated flow heat coupling model of embankment dams was established through laboratory sand tank experiments of concentrated leakage in embankment dams the accuracy of the flow heat coupling model under 10 types of tcems were tested and compared the results show that the performance of the flow heat coupling model varies under different types of tcems and the chung and horton 1987 model shows better simulation effects with a coefficient of determination r2 root mean square error rmse and relative error re ranging from 0 916 to 0 980 0 266 0 467 and 1 370 2 442 respectively therefore this model could better reflect the dynamic temperature variations in embankment dams finally the flow heat coupling model was improved by modifying the comsol built in equation i e built in comsol model was replaced by the chung and horton 1987 model which further improved the accuracy of the flow heat coupling model in the numerical simulation of seepage heat monitoring based on the improved model the concentrated leakage of embankment dams under dynamic water levels was simulated numerically under the condition of a dynamic water level the flow velocity and pressure at the leakage passage are positively correlated with the water level change and the temperature field also shows the same change trend keywords leakage of embankment dam flow heat coupling model heat tracing method seepage field temperature field 1 introduction embankment dams are one of the most common and important buildings in hydraulic engineering they have the functions of retaining flood water increasing river discharge during the dry season increasing air humidity and reducing regional temperature difference to eliminate urban heat island effect to some extent the embankment dam itself built by earth and stone materials has a certain permeability when the river water level rises in the flood season water seepage must appear in the dam body if the construction quality is not up to standard it will cause a variety of leakage risks al janabi et al 2020 bonelli et al 2019 schmitz et al 2021 as an indispensable part of safety monitoring of embankment dams seepage monitoring can not only detect abnormal parts of seepage and evaluate the operation status of embankment dams husein et al 2015 wang et al 2016 but also predict the development trend of seepage to formulate measures for removing risks and strengthening and to ensure the safe operation of embankment dams abdulsamad et al 2019 ming et al 2021 soueid ahmed et al 2019 as an important engineering safety monitoring method heat tracing method plays a great role in the leakage of earth rock dams yaser et al 2020 seepage of karst water chi et al 2020 crack detection of concrete structures chen et al 2021a chen et al 2021b and hyporheic exchange zhang et al 2019 zhang et al 2021 due to their advantages of high efficiency accuracy and low environmental pollution in recent years research on the heat tracing method in the seepage field has increased and the application of seepage heat monitoring technology in embankment dams has gradually become extensive he et al 2021 jiang et al 2020 liu et al 2019 yan et al 2015 rau et al 2014 summarized the research results of natural heat transfer and induced heat transfer and used heat as a tracer to carry out relevant research yosef et al 2018 analyzed dam seepage by using distributed optical fiber temperature measurement technology and the finite difference method and found that temperature changes in earth rock dams are closely related to seepage conditions seepage heat monitoring technology is also called heat tracing seepage monitoring technology its theoretical basis is the coupling effect of the seepage field and temperature field in rock and soil flow heat coupling water migration in the medium plays a decisive role in the change in the temperature field and the temporal and spatial distribution of the temperature field can invert the characteristics of the seepage field an et al 2018 developed a numerical method combining the flow heat coupling model with the soil atmosphere interaction model and applied it to seepage monitoring in embankments ren et al 2019b established a saturated unsaturated flow heat coupling model through an indoor sand tank experiment and studied the temperature change rule of sand samples under the condition of changing water head and water temperature the results showed that the low temperature area of the sand tank was positively correlated with the infiltration water head and the water temperature had a significant influence on the temperature field of the sand tank bui et al 2019 verified the established flow heat coupling model by using the seepage velocity observation method and found that longitudinal seepage has a greater impact on temperature than other directions however the influence of thermal conductivity on the flow heat coupling model has not been fully considered in previous studies therefore there is still much room to improve the accuracy of flow heat coupling model thermal conductivity is an important parameter in the flow heat coupling model and its value is closely related to soil porosity saturation organic matter content particle size distribution and other factors since the 1970s various prediction models have been proposed campbell 1985 lu et al 2007 nikoosokhan et al 2016 johansen 1975 proposed the normalized thermal conductivity model which can predict the thermal conductivity of soils of different textures and has been widely used at present to simplify the functions in the johansen 1975 model cÃ´tÃ© and konrad 2005 proposed an empirical model of thermal conductivity related only to particle composition and texture on the basis of johansen s 1975 normalized model ren et al 2019a established a new model considering the influence of organic matter content and each grain composition on soil shape factors which further improved the prediction accuracy zhang et al 2020a b developed a new prediction model and a thermal conductivity prediction curve based on an artificial neural network ann by fitting the measured values of thermal conductivity of 257 unsaturated soils to guide engineering practice the model can quantitatively and systematically consider the coupling effect of multiple influencing factors bayat et al 2021 used the ann method to propose a new model for predicting soil thermal conductivity using terrain attributes and soil physical parameters the study found that compared with multiple nonlinear regression this method has higher fitting accuracy it is necessary to find the best thermal conductivity empirical model tcem to improve the accuracy of flow heat coupling numerical simulation by assessing the performance of the various tcems through experiments in previous flow heat coupling model studies simulation accuracy testing under various tcems is rare zhang 2020a b used the data collected from the field heat tracing experiment in the riparian zone to test and compare the flow heat coupling model of the riparian zone under 12 types of tcems however the field experiment is greatly affected by the external environment there are many uncontrollable factors and large data errors in contrast the laboratory experiment is less affected by the external environment the experimental conditions are easy to control and the data error is small which is more convincing for the test of the flow heat coupling model under various tcems in this study the richards equation was used to simulate water flow in the soil based on the richards equation the heat transfer theory of porous media and tcems flow heat models of embankment dams were established through laboratory sand tank experiments of concentrated leakage in embankment dams on the one hand the accuracy of the flow heat coupling model under 10 types of tcems was tested and the optimal thermal conductivity empirical model was obtained on the other hand the effects of head water temperature and leakage passage height on the concentrated leakage of embankment dams were analyzed in addition by modifying the comsol built in equation to replace the built in thermal conductivity model the flow heat coupling model was improved which further improved the accuracy of the flow heat coupling model in the numerical simulation of seepage heat monitoring the seepage field and temperature field of the embankment dam under the condition of dynamic water level were simulated the leakage law was summarized and the response of the temperature field to the seepage field was analyzed 2 flow heat coupling mathematical model and

of minerals pore water and air and its thermal conductivity depends on the thermal conductivity of a single component and its volume fraction assuming that the micro units are a plane with a homogeneous composition of minerals pore water and air we can obtain 29 s s s w s a 1 where s s s w and s a represent the volume fractions of minerals pore water and air respectively and the soil thermal conductivity can be expressed as 30 k eff k s s s k w s w k a s a s where s is cross section area of the sample m2 since 31 s s s 1 n s w s a s n s w s n s r eq 30 can be rewritten as 32 k eff k s 1 n 0 01 k w n s r k a n 1 0 01 s r where the thermal conductivity of minerals can be determined by eq 12 the thermal conductivities of water and air at 20 c are 0 594 w m k and 0 0267 w m k respectively 2 3 8 built in comsol models the comsol multiphysics software provides users with three thermal conductivity empirical models in the porous media heat transfer module the volume average

porous media in comsol were used to describe the flow and heat transfer process of water in the soil and the difference in heat transfer under different water content environments can be realized through custom partial differential equations i e the modification and replacement of thermal conductivity model zhang et al 2020a b proved the feasibility of this method the coefficient type partial

physical meanings in different problems the coefficients can be defined as different types of functions according to actual physical problems for example when establishing a heat transfer equation d a

sensors a multifunction data converter a computer and an earth rock embankment dam the basic structure is shown in fig 2 a the two ends of the sand tank were separated by plexiglass perforated plates and gauze into an upstream inlet section and a downstream outlet section with a width of 0 1 m the embankment dam was filled with fine sand with a section length of 1 92 m and height of 0 45 m the upstream and downstream ratios of the embankment dam slope were both 1 2 and the embankment dam crest was 0 12 m wide the concentrated leakage passage was filled with sand and gravel and the passage section was a circle with a radius of 0 01 m a temperature sensor array was arranged on the central section of the embankment dam to monitor temperature changes 26 temperature sensors were arranged on the dam body and a temperature sensor was arranged in front of the dam used to monitor the change in infiltration water temperature taking point a as the origin fig 2b the coordinates of all temperature sensors are shown in table 2 the type specification of temperature sensors used in the experiment was omb daq 54 55 56 this sensor type has high accuracy good stability and a timely response within the normal temperature measurement range the temperature sensors transmitted signals to the pc in real time through the omega data transmitter three sand samples in the experiment sand were brought back to the laboratory for particle analysis and bulk density measurement the bulk density Ï b and the particle density Ï s of the sand used in the sand tank experiments were measured by individual experiments the porosity n was determined by n 1 Ï b Ï s 100 the values of quartz content q and sand content m s a n d were determined by particle composition analysis the particle composition of the sand samples was determined by a malvern laser particle size analyzer its principle is the dynamic light scattering method also known as the quasi elastic light scattering method it is a mature noninvasive technology that can measure particle size in the range of microns before the start of the experiment the water temperature was controlled within the required temperature range for the experiment all temperature sensors were connected to the data transmitter and the computer was started to record the initial temperature of the temperature sensors after all preparations were completed the water inlet of the corresponding water level was opened to allow water to enter the sand tank and a small water pump was used to circulate the water supply to keep the water level stable at the same time the water outlet at the tail of the sand tank was opened the water outlet and the measuring cylinder were connected by a short plastic pipe to measure the leakage flow of the dam and the data were recorded every 5 min in addition pressure measuring tubes were installed on the outside of the tank to measure the pressure head of the embankment dam and the data were recorded every 30 min the experiments were carried out for 3 different infiltration heads 0 2 m 0 3 m and 0 4 m 3 different infiltration water temperatures 10 c 25 c and 35 c and 3 different leakage passage heights no leakage passage 0 1 m high leakage passage and 0 2 m high leakage passage the specific scheme is shown in table 3 3 2 boundary conditions and numerical modeling setup based on laboratory experiments and mathematical models combined with self defined thermal conductivity partial differential equations comsol software was used to solve the saturated unsaturated embankment dam flow heat coupling model as shown in fig 2b according to different materials and permeabilities the whole model was divided into three areas the main body of the dam was zone 1 the leakage passage was zone 2 and the drainage prism was zone 3 it was assumed that each zone was a homogeneous and isotropic material the boundary conditions were set according to the fifth group of experiments condition 5 there were two main types of seepage field boundaries a constant head boundary the upstream head boundary de was set to 0 4 m and the downstream head boundary cf was set to 0 05 m b no flow boundary the boundaries ab ae bf and cd except those upstream and downstream were set as no flow boundaries there were two main types of temperature field boundaries c constant water temperature boundary the upstream water temperature boundary de was set to 25 the third formula in eq 36 and the temperature boundaries ae ab bf and cf in contact with air were set to 15 c the third formula in eq 36 d adiabatic boundary the temperature boundary of the lower part of the dam was set as the adiabatic boundary the second formula in eq 36 referring to the relevant literature carsel and parrish 1988 naranjo and smith 2016 table 4 gives the hydraulic and thermal parameters to evaluate the flow heat coupling model of the embankment dam where the values of msand msilt mclay and Ïs were measured experimentally the values of longitudinal dispersivity Î±l and transverse dispersivity Î±t in the text were considered to be 0 01 m naranjo and smith 2016 3 3 criterion for model performance evaluation to evaluate the accuracy of the saturated unsaturated flow heat coupling models based on 10 types of tcems the coefficient of determination r2 root mean square error rmse and relative error re were introduced vafakhah 2013 r 2 1 i 1 n o i s i 2 i 1 n o i o 2 r m s e i 1 n o i s i 2 n r e i 1 n o i s i 2 i 1 n o i 2 where o i is the actual measured value at moment i s i is the simulated value at moment i n is the number of samples and o is the average level of the measured value the value of the coefficient of determination represents the degree of correlation the closer r2 is to 1 the higher the correlation between the simulated and measured values the root mean square error a nonnegative value is used to measure the deviation between the simulated values and the measured values the smaller the rmse value is the smaller the deviation between the simulated and measured values the relative error reflects the credibility of the simulated values and is often expressed as a percentage the smaller the re value is the more credible the simulated values are zounemat kermani et al 2016 3 4 numerical simulation of leakage in embankment dams under dynamic water levels due to limitations of the laboratory experiments conditions such as rising falling and sine water level in front of the dam cannot be achieved the condition 5 was taken as the prototype for numerical simulation and parts of the boundary conditions de were changed the relationship between the water level h and time t is shown in table 5 in addition constant head conditions of 0 3 m and 0 4 m were set as a comparison and the other boundary conditions and parameter settings were not changed the transient seepage field and temperature field of the embankment dam when concentrated leakage occurred were simulated 4 results and discussion 4 1 research on water and heat transfer in embankment dams during concentrated leakage 4 1 1 head to study the influence of different heads on the law of water and heat transfer in embankment dams under concentrated leakage conditions the first second and third groups of experiments conditions 1 2 and 3 were selected for comparison by using the temperature data measured by 27 temperature sensors under 3 conditions the temperature field of the center section of the dam was displayed as shown in fig 3 with increasing time the temperature of the dam body gradually increased in the 3 conditions and the temperature changes upstream and around the leakage passage were the most obvious through comparison it could be seen that different heads have a significant impact on the temperature field of the dam with a leakage passage the higher the head was the faster the temperature around the leakage passage changed when the water level was 0 3 m the change in the temperature field around the entire leakage passage could be clearly seen from 90 min which is much earlier than the condition of the 0 2 m water level and later than the condition of the 0 4 m water level according to the seepage discharge data measured in the experiments the curves of the seepage discharge per unit width of the embankment dam under different heads with time were drawn as shown in fig 4 a the seepage discharge per unit width of the embankment dam under the 3 conditions hardly changed when the experiments were carried out for 130 min which proved that the leakage of the embankment dam was stable at this time a higher head meant earlier leakage of the dam body and a larger seepage discharge per unit width of the embankment dam when the seepage was stable 4 1 2 water temperature to study the influence of different water temperatures on the law of water and heat transfer in embankment dams under concentrated leakage conditions the fourth fifth and sixth groups of experiments conditions 4 5 and 6 were selected for comparison the drawing of the temperature field of the dam is shown in fig 3 the temperature field in the center and the downstream section of the dam changed when experiment conditions 5 and 6 were carried out for 30 min and condition 4 was carried out for 90 min which indicated that the higher the water temperature was the faster the temperature field of the embankment dam changed the change curve of the seepage discharge per unit width of the embankment dam with time under the 3 conditions is shown in fig 4b the leakage time of the dam under the 3 conditions was approximately the same and the seepage discharge per unit width was stable when the experiments were carried out for 120 min the higher the water temperature was the larger the seepage discharge per unit width of the embankment dam would be when it was stable 4 1 3 leakage passage height to study the influence of different leakage passage heights on the law of water and heat transfer in embankment dams under concentrated leakage conditions the third fifth and seventh groups of experiments conditions 3 5 and 7 were selected for comparison a drawing of the temperature field of the dam is shown in fig 3 when there was no leakage passage that is no concentrated leakage occurred the temperature field of the dam changed normally over time the temperature of the downstream section was always close to the ambient temperature when the height of the leakage passage was 0 1 m the temperature field in the downstream section of the dam body changed significantly and the temperature distribution was uniform at 300 min when the height of the leakage passage was 0 2 m the changes in the temperature field around the leakage passage could be clearly seen from 90 min and the temperature gradually rose over time the change curve of the seepage discharge per unit width of the embankment dam with time under the 3 conditions is shown in fig 4c when there was a leakage passage in the dam body the leakage time of the two conditions was roughly the same and the seepage discharge per unit width stabilized after 120 min from the beginning of the experiments the stable seepage discharge per unit width of the leakage passage at a height of 0 1 m was greater than that at a height of 0 2 m however when there was no leakage passage in the dam the seepage discharge per unit width stabilized after 30 min from the beginning of the experiment and the stable seepage discharge per unit width was much smaller than the other two conditions 4 2 model test and comparative analysis the condition 5 was taken as the prototype for numerical simulation the flow heat coupling model under 10 types of tcems was tested and compared 4 2 1 test of the seepage field the laboratory experiment device was equipped with piezometer tubes which could reflect the change of the piezometer tube head in real time during the experiments and the dam body saturated lines can be obtained comparing the simulated saturated lines of the flow heat coupling models based on 10 tcems with the measured saturated lines as shown in fig 5 it could be seen that the simulated saturated lines of the flow heat coupling models based on 10 tcems were in good agreement with the measured saturated lines among which the johansen 1975 model chung and horton 1987 model and power law model performed better than others 4 2 2 test of the temperature field the simulated values of measurement points ts13 ts14 ts15 ts19 ts20 and ts21 were selected from the field point probe temperature dataset the reason for the selection is that the length of the seepage path is positively correlated with the experiment error we assume that the dam body is homogeneous and isotropic fig 6 shows a fitting diagram of the simulated temperature data of 10 tcems with the measured temperature data of the laboratory experiment all 10 tcems could simulate the temperature field of the dam body accurately but the accuracy of each model was significantly different table 6 shows the calculated values of r2 rmse and re of the 10 models at the selected 6 measuring points to intuitively reflect the fitting effect of the models at each measuring point the content of table 6 was displayed in the form of a radar chart as shown in fig 7 the performance of the models at each measurement point was significantly different for example for measuring point ts19 the simulation accuracy of the johansen 1975 model and volume average model was relatively high while the simulation accuracy of the cÃ´tÃ© and konrad 2005 model and zhao et al 2019 model was low for measuring point ts20 the simulation accuracy of the johansen 1975 model chung and horton 1987 model ewen and thomas 1987 model volume average model reciprocal average model and power law model was all relatively high while the simulation accuracy of the cÃ´tÃ© and konrad 2005 model and zhao et al 2019 model was low in addition we found that compared with the other 5 measuring points the simulated values of the 10 models at ts21 had a large deviation from the measured values a possible explanation was that the other 5 measuring points all changed from the unsaturated zone to the saturated zone while ts21 was always in the unsaturated zone so the response to the tcems which changed with the change in water content was poor to further evaluate the models the mean values of the three evaluation indicators were plotted as shown in fig 8 among the first 7 empirical models the johansen 1975 model chung and horton 1987 model and ewen and thomas 1987 model have relatively high simulation accuracy through a comprehensive analysis of 3 evaluation indicators it was found that the chung and horton 1987 model performed best even better than the built in comsol models while the performance of the other 4 empirical models was average among which the cÃ´tÃ© and konrad 2005 model and zhao et al 2019 model had large deviations between the simulated values and the measured values among the 3 built in comsol models the power law model showed the best performance which is consistent with the conclusion of zhang et al 2020a b from a global perspective as shown in fig 9 the symbols of the johansen 1975 model the chung and horton 1987 model and the ewen and thomas 1987 model were in a narrower range along the 1 1 line and they had high correlation coefficient values the performance was as good as that of the 3 built in software models from the above results the flow heat coupling model under the chung and horton 1987 model is more accurate to simulate the temperature field of embankment dam by comparing the simulated temperature field based on this model with the measured temperature data the abnormal seepage position can be found more accurately which provides theoretical basis for the danger removal and reinforcement of embankment dam 4 3 analysis of the leakage law and temperature field response of embankment dams under dynamic water levels the built in comsol tcems were replaced by the chung and horton 1987 model the improved flow heat coupling model was used to calculate the seepage field of the embankment dam under 5 dynamic water levels as shown in fig 10 after leakage occurred the flow lines in the leakage passage gradually became denser the flow velocity increased and the saturated line rose at the same time the change in the water level affects the leakage rate and the rise and fall of the saturated line to intuitively reflect the impact of water level changes on the seepage field at the leakage passage a domain point probe was set in the model to monitor the pressure value and flow velocity changes in real time the position of the domain point probe is shown in fig 11 and the coordinates are 0 8 0 2 the pressure value calculated by the model was plotted as shown in fig 12 a between approximately 0 25 min the pressure at the measuring point in each condition showed a rapid rising trend and the rising speed of the two conditions with an initial water level of 0 4 m was faster than that of the other three conditions therefore at approximately 25 min the pressure of these two conditions was greater than that of the other three conditions in the next 50 min the pressure of each measuring point rose at a relatively small speed after approximately 75 min the pressure at the measuring point showed different trends with the change in the water level in each condition the pressures of the 0 3 m and 0 4 m water level conditions were maintained at approximately 730 pa and 1750 pa respectively under the condition of a rising water level the pressure at the measuring point continued to increase at a smaller rate and increased to approximately 1500 pa at 300 min under the condition of a falling water level the pressure at the measuring point continued to decrease at the same speed and decreased to approximately 830 pa at 300 min the pressure in the condition of a sinusoidal water level also roughly presented the shape of a sine curve the flow velocity change at the measuring point is shown in fig 12b at the beginning of leakage the flow velocity at the measuring point of each condition rose rapidly and the higher the initial water head was the greater the acceleration was and the greater the peak flow velocity was after reaching the peak value the flow velocity at the measuring point of each condition showed a downward trend and then tended to be stable the higher the initial water head was the greater the acceleration was and the lower the steady flow velocity was compared with the condition of the 0 4 m water level the fall of water level would cause the steady flow velocity to decrease by approximately 3 5 10 5m s even smaller than the condition of the 0 3 m water level compared with the working condition of the 0 3 m water level the rise of water level would cause the steady flow velocity to increase by approximately 5 10 5m s even greater than the condition of the 0 4 m water level under the working condition of a sinusoidal water level the flow velocity in the leakage passage also fluctuated roughly in the same form compared with the condition where the water level rises and falls at a constant speed the faster the water level changed the larger the flow velocity value changed the existence of a seepage passage changes the seepage field of the embankment dam which will lead to changes in the temperature field of the embankment dam there are two forms of heat transfer in the embankment dam heat conduction and heat convection heat conduction mainly occurs in the vertical direction when the ground temperature changes by 15 the temperature change value at 5 m below the ground is 7 1 and the temperature change value at 10 m below the ground is 1 7 compared with heat conduction heat convection transfer is more obvious even if the water flow is small flow velocity of 10 6 10 7 m s it will have a greater impact on the temperature field therefore the water temperature is the dominant factor affecting the temperature change of the dam the temperature field of each condition calculated based on the improved flow heat coupling model is shown in fig 13 the temperature field responded well to the seepage field as a whole when the water level rose as the water head increased the flow velocity around the leakage passage increased the pressure rose rapidly and the temperature around the passage rose accordingly compared with the condition of the 0 3 m water level the high temperature area around the passage was larger but less than the condition of the 0 4 m water level while the situation was opposite when the water level fell for the condition of a sinusoidal water level the temperature field could also respond quickly to further prove the reliability of the conclusion the temperature values of the measuring points of each condition are plotted in fig 12c the temperature and pressure changes of the measuring point showed the same trend which was very obviously related to the water level change and had a certain degree of hysteresis a similar hysteresis also appeared in the study of song and yosef 2017 4 4 limitation of the research 4 4 1 the concentration points of abnormal temperature in fig 3 it is worth noting that when the height difference between the water level and the leakage passage was 0 2 m conditions 2 4 5 and 6 a concentration point of abnormal temperature appeared near the outlet of the leakage passage a probable explanation was that the leakage passage set up in the experiments did not penetrate the dam body when the seepage water flowed through the passage to the drainage prism it stagnated or even flowed back due to the blockage of sand the seepage velocity is positively correlated with water head when the flow rate is small the gaps between the sand particles ensure that seepage flows through in a timely manner and does not cause erosion damage to sand samples when the flow rate is large the erosion of the sand sample by the water flow increases and the gaps between the particles increase it can be seen that with the increase of water head and seepage velocity the seepage will gather at the downstream of the embankment dam through the centralized leakage passage which is not conducive to the stability of the embankment dam therefore the leakage monitoring of the embankment dam is very necessary 4 4 2 the under estimation of the saturated lines in fig 5 in the downstream section of the embankment dam the simulated saturated line of the flow heat coupling model under any thermal conductivity empirical model is lower than the measured saturated line it is almost certain that this is because the size of the drainage prism in the experiment is too small or the drainage capacity is poor the leakage water cannot be discharged from the dam in time and the water silts downstream of the dam resulting in the rise of the saturated line from the perspective of dam risk analysis this means dam weakening we suggest that good drainage measures must be set in laboratory experiments or engineering construction which is very important to the stability of the dam 4 4 3 jump of measured temperature series in fig 6 it is obvious that the temperature jumps at about t 210 min the temperature increases for ts13 14 15 20 21 but decreases for ts19 the possible reason is the error in water temperature control because the room temperature is lower than the experimental water temperature the heat diffusion leads to a short maintenance time of the experimental water temperature and with the water infiltration the water level in front of the dam decreases we need to add constant temperature water regularly to maintain the water temperature and water level which causes a certain error to the experiment when preparing thermostatic water the water temperature in the upper layer may be low and that in the lower layer may be high due to uneven mixing ts19 is located in the outermost layer of the dam and is very sensitive to the infiltration of low temperature water in the upper layer so the measured value of temperature decreases ts13 14 15 20 21 are located in the inner layer of the dam body when the seepage flow passes through these positions it has been mixed evenly and the temperature is slightly higher than the pore water temperature so the measured temperature rises however the transient temperature jump will not affect the evaluation results of the model and the results are still very convincing although the heat tracing method has the advantages of high efficiency sensitivity and low cost it still has many limitations in embankment dams leakage monitoring for example the arrangement of measuring points of point sensors is limited and it is often difficult to detect all the points when there are many centralized leakage areas in the embankment dams distributed optical fiber sensors can solve this problem to a certain extent and have great engineering application potential however for very long distance of the flow path or very slow flow velocity the water temperature signal might not be detected due to the energy dissipation therefore comprehensive analysis of embankment dam leakage by various methods such as resistivity method transient electromagnetic method etc can improve the reliability of detection results on the other hand the research only carried out numerical simulation for 2d laboratory model for the 3d large scale model or the case with real scale of dams the simplification of model details and the anisotropy of thermal conductivity need to be considered and the setting of boundary conditions on surface area needs to be studied which will become our next work in addition the layout of temperature sensors and the assessment of the necessary input parameters of tcem are also great challenges for 3d real scale embankment dams first of all for the completed embankment dams temperature sensors must be installed without affecting the normal operation of the embankment dams which will be an interesting question for the embankment dams during construction we recommend installing distributed optical fiber temperature sensors designing different layout methods and comparing the monitoring results to determine the best layout method secondly in the process of monitoring regular sampling and testing should be carried out to update the soil parameters in time and improve the accuracy of numerical simulation finally in order to avoid the error caused by too small temperature gradient between water and soil and ensure the accuracy of monitoring results the combination of seepage heat monitoring and other monitoring methods is a good idea 5 conclusions in this paper combined with thermal conductivity empirical models tcems the saturated unsaturated flow heat coupling model of embankment dams was established through laboratory sand tank experiments of concentrated leakage in embankment dams on the one hand the accuracy of the flow heat coupling model under 10 types of tcems was tested and compared and the chung and horton 1987 model shows better simulation effects on the other hand the effects of head water temperature and leakage passage height on the concentrated leakage of embankment dams were analyzed a high temperature and high water head have obvious promotion effects on the leakage of the embankment dam the smaller the distance between the leakage passage and the bottom of the dam is the faster the leakage rate is the flow heat coupling model was improved by modifying the comsol built in equation i e built in comsol model was replaced by the chung and horton 1987 model which further improved the accuracy of the flow heat coupling model in the numerical simulation of seepage heat monitoring based on the improved model the seepage field and temperature field of the embankment dam when concentrated seepage occurred under the conditions of rising falling and sine water level were numerically simulated when the water level changes the seepage field and temperature field of the embankment dam with concentrated leakage passage will also change accordingly the changes in the seepage passage are the most obvious and the pressure and temperature changes are strongly correlated with the water level changes this study still has many limitations the measured saturated lines and temperature data are not perfect due to improper setting of drainage prism and leakage passage in sand tank experiment but have little influence on the experimental results considering the simplification of model details the anisotropy of thermal conductivity and the setting of boundary conditions in surface area 3d numerical simulation on the case with real scale of dams is our next work credit authorship contribution statement shenghao nan

3501,recently the use of heat as a tracer to evaluate the process of leakage in embankment dams has attracted wide attention a more accurate flow heat coupling model of embankment dams could help us to better understand the patterns of water flow and heat transfer in embankment dams and provide a scientific basis for the seepage prevention and repair of these dams in this paper combined with thermal conductivity empirical models tcems the saturated unsaturated flow heat coupling model of embankment dams was established through laboratory sand tank experiments of concentrated leakage in embankment dams the accuracy of the flow heat coupling model under 10 types of tcems were tested and compared the results show that the performance of the flow heat coupling model varies under different types of tcems and the chung and horton 1987 model shows better simulation effects with a coefficient of determination r2 root mean square error rmse and relative error re ranging from 0 916 to 0 980 0 266 0 467 and 1 370 2 442 respectively therefore this model could better reflect the dynamic temperature variations in embankment dams finally the flow heat coupling model was improved by modifying the comsol built in equation i e built in comsol model was replaced by the chung and horton 1987 model which further improved the accuracy of the flow heat coupling model in the numerical simulation of seepage heat monitoring based on the improved model the concentrated leakage of embankment dams under dynamic water levels was simulated numerically under the condition of a dynamic water level the flow velocity and pressure at the leakage passage are positively correlated with the water level change and the temperature field also shows the same change trend keywords leakage of embankment dam flow heat coupling model heat tracing method seepage field temperature field 1 introduction embankment dams are one of the most common and important buildings in hydraulic engineering they have the functions of retaining flood water increasing river discharge during the dry season increasing air humidity and reducing regional temperature difference to eliminate urban heat island effect to some extent the embankment dam itself built by earth and stone materials has a certain permeability when the river water level rises in the flood season water seepage must appear in the dam body if the construction quality is not up to standard it will cause a variety of leakage risks al janabi et al 2020 bonelli et al 2019 schmitz et al 2021 as an indispensable part of safety monitoring of embankment dams seepage monitoring can not only detect abnormal parts of seepage and evaluate the operation status of embankment dams husein et al 2015 wang et al 2016 but also predict the development trend of seepage to formulate measures for removing risks and strengthening and to ensure the safe operation of embankment dams abdulsamad et al 2019 ming et al 2021 soueid ahmed et al 2019 as an important engineering safety monitoring method heat tracing method plays a great role in the leakage of earth rock dams yaser et al 2020 seepage of karst water chi et al 2020 crack detection of concrete structures chen et al 2021a chen et al 2021b and hyporheic exchange zhang et al 2019 zhang et al 2021 due to their advantages of high efficiency accuracy and low environmental pollution in recent years research on the heat tracing method in the seepage field has increased and the application of seepage heat monitoring technology in embankment dams has gradually become extensive he et al 2021 jiang et al 2020 liu et al 2019 yan et al 2015 rau et al 2014 summarized the research results of natural heat transfer and induced heat transfer and used heat as a tracer to carry out relevant research yosef et al 2018 analyzed dam seepage by using distributed optical fiber temperature measurement technology and the finite difference method and found that temperature changes in earth rock dams are closely related to seepage conditions seepage heat monitoring technology is also called heat tracing seepage monitoring technology its theoretical basis is the coupling effect of the seepage field and temperature field in rock and soil flow heat coupling water migration in the medium plays a decisive role in the change in the temperature field and the temporal and spatial distribution of the temperature field can invert the characteristics of the seepage field an et al 2018 developed a numerical method combining the flow heat coupling model with the soil atmosphere interaction model and applied it to seepage monitoring in embankments ren et al 2019b established a saturated unsaturated flow heat coupling model through an indoor sand tank experiment and studied the temperature change rule of sand samples under the condition of changing water head and water temperature the results showed that the low temperature area of the sand tank was positively correlated with the infiltration water head and the water temperature had a significant influence on the temperature field of the sand tank bui et al 2019 verified the established flow heat coupling model by using the seepage velocity observation method and found that longitudinal seepage has a greater impact on temperature than other directions however the influence of thermal conductivity on the flow heat coupling model has not been fully considered in previous studies therefore there is still much room to improve the accuracy of flow heat coupling model thermal conductivity is an important parameter in the flow heat coupling model and its value is closely related to soil porosity saturation organic matter content particle size distribution and other factors since the 1970s various prediction models have been proposed campbell 1985 lu et al 2007 nikoosokhan et al 2016 johansen 1975 proposed the normalized thermal conductivity model which can predict the thermal conductivity of soils of different textures and has been widely used at present to simplify the functions in the johansen 1975 model cÃ´tÃ© and konrad 2005 proposed an empirical model of thermal conductivity related only to particle composition and texture on the basis of johansen s 1975 normalized model ren et al 2019a established a new model considering the influence of organic matter content and each grain composition on soil shape factors which further improved the prediction accuracy zhang et al 2020a b developed a new prediction model and a thermal conductivity prediction curve based on an artificial neural network ann by fitting the measured values of thermal conductivity of 257 unsaturated soils to guide engineering practice the model can quantitatively and systematically consider the coupling effect of multiple influencing factors bayat et al 2021 used the ann method to propose a new model for predicting soil thermal conductivity using terrain attributes and soil physical parameters the study found that compared with multiple nonlinear regression this method has higher fitting accuracy it is necessary to find the best thermal conductivity empirical model tcem to improve the accuracy of flow heat coupling numerical simulation by assessing the performance of the various tcems through experiments in previous flow heat coupling model studies simulation accuracy testing under various tcems is rare zhang 2020a b used the data collected from the field heat tracing experiment in the riparian zone to test and compare the flow heat coupling model of the riparian zone under 12 types of tcems however the field experiment is greatly affected by the external environment there are many uncontrollable factors and large data errors in contrast the laboratory experiment is less affected by the external environment the experimental conditions are easy to control and the data error is small which is more convincing for the test of the flow heat coupling model under various tcems in this study the richards equation was used to simulate water flow in the soil based on the richards equation the heat transfer theory of porous media and tcems flow heat models of embankment dams were established through laboratory sand tank experiments of concentrated leakage in embankment dams on the one hand the accuracy of the flow heat coupling model under 10 types of tcems was tested and the optimal thermal conductivity empirical model was obtained on the other hand the effects of head water temperature and leakage passage height on the concentrated leakage of embankment dams were analyzed in addition by modifying the comsol built in equation to replace the built in thermal conductivity model the flow heat coupling model was improved which further improved the accuracy of the flow heat coupling model in the numerical simulation of seepage heat monitoring the seepage field and temperature field of the embankment dam under the condition of dynamic water level were simulated the leakage law was summarized and the response of the temperature field to the seepage field was analyzed 2 flow heat coupling mathematical model and

too cumbersome cÃ´tÃ© and konrad 2005 introduced the variable Îº the influence of soil type coarse sand fine sand silt sand and clay on the k e s r relationship can be reflected by the Îº value 18 ke

of minerals pore water and air and its thermal conductivity depends on the thermal conductivity of a single component and its volume fraction assuming that the micro units are a plane with a homogeneous composition of minerals pore water and air we can obtain 29 s s s w s a 1 where s s s w and s a represent the volume fractions of minerals pore water and air respectively and the soil thermal conductivity can be expressed as 30 k eff k s s s k w s w k a s a s where s is cross section area of the sample m2 since 31 s s s 1 n s w s a s n s w s n s r eq 30 can be rewritten as 32 k eff

porous media in comsol were used to describe the flow and heat transfer process of water in the soil and the difference in heat transfer under different water content environments can be realized through custom partial differential equations i e the modification and replacement of thermal conductivity model zhang et al 2020a b proved the feasibility of this method the coefficient type partial

temperature sensors are shown in table 2 the type specification of temperature sensors used in the experiment was omb daq 54 55 56 this sensor type has high accuracy good stability and a timely response within the normal temperature measurement range the temperature sensors transmitted signals to the pc in real time through the omega data transmitter three sand samples in the experiment sand were brought back to the laboratory for particle analysis and bulk density measurement the bulk density Ï b and the particle density Ï s of the sand used in the sand tank experiments were measured by individual experiments the porosity n was determined by n 1 Ï b Ï s 100 the values of quartz content q and sand content m s a n d were determined by particle composition analysis the particle composition of the sand samples was determined by a malvern laser particle size analyzer its principle is the dynamic light scattering method also known as the quasi elastic light scattering method it is a mature noninvasive technology that can measure particle size in the range of microns before the start of the experiment the water temperature was controlled within the required temperature range for the experiment all temperature sensors were connected to the data transmitter and the computer was started to record the initial temperature of the temperature sensors after all preparations were completed the water inlet of the corresponding water level was opened to allow water to enter the sand tank and a small water pump was used to circulate the water supply to keep the water level stable at the same time the water outlet at the tail of the sand tank was opened the water outlet and the measuring cylinder were connected by a short plastic pipe to measure the leakage flow of the dam and the data were recorded every 5 min in addition pressure measuring tubes were installed on the outside of the tank to measure the pressure head of the embankment dam and the data were recorded every 30 min the experiments were carried out for 3 different infiltration heads 0 2 m 0 3 m and 0 4 m 3 different infiltration water temperatures 10 c 25 c and 35 c and 3 different leakage passage heights no leakage passage 0 1 m high leakage passage and 0 2 m high leakage passage the specific scheme is shown in table 3 3 2 boundary conditions and numerical modeling setup based on laboratory experiments and mathematical models combined with self defined thermal conductivity partial differential equations comsol software was used to solve the saturated unsaturated embankment dam flow heat coupling model as shown in fig 2b according to different materials and permeabilities the whole model was divided into three areas the main body of the dam was zone 1 the leakage passage was zone 2 and the drainage prism was zone 3 it was assumed that each zone was a homogeneous and isotropic material the boundary conditions were set according to the fifth group of experiments condition 5 there were two main types of seepage field boundaries a constant head boundary the upstream head boundary de was set to 0 4 m and the downstream head boundary cf was set to 0 05 m b no flow boundary the boundaries ab ae bf and cd except those upstream and downstream were set as no flow boundaries there were two main types of temperature field boundaries c constant water temperature boundary the upstream water temperature boundary de was set to 25 the third formula in eq 36 and the temperature boundaries ae ab bf and cf in contact with air were set to 15 c the third formula in eq 36 d adiabatic boundary the temperature boundary of the lower part of the dam was set as the adiabatic boundary the second formula in eq 36 referring to the relevant literature carsel and parrish 1988 naranjo and smith 2016 table 4 gives the hydraulic and thermal parameters to evaluate the flow heat coupling model of the embankment dam where the values of msand msilt mclay and Ïs were measured experimentally the values of longitudinal dispersivity Î±l and transverse dispersivity Î±t in the text were considered to be 0 01 m naranjo and smith 2016 3 3 criterion for model performance evaluation to evaluate the accuracy of the saturated unsaturated flow heat coupling models based on 10 types of tcems the coefficient of determination r2 root mean square error rmse and relative error re were introduced vafakhah 2013 r

samples and o is the average level of the measured value the value of the coefficient of determination represents the degree of correlation the closer r2 is to 1 the higher the correlation between the simulated and measured values the root mean square error a nonnegative value is used to measure the deviation between the simulated values and the measured values the smaller the rmse value is the smaller the deviation between the simulated and measured values the relative error reflects the credibility of the simulated values and is often expressed as a percentage the smaller the re value is the more credible the simulated values are zounemat kermani et al 2016 3 4 numerical simulation of leakage in embankment dams under dynamic water levels due to limitations of the laboratory experiments conditions such as rising falling and sine water level in front of the dam cannot be achieved the condition 5 was taken as the prototype for numerical simulation and parts of the boundary conditions de were changed the relationship between the water level h and time t is shown in table 5 in addition constant head conditions of 0 3 m and 0 4 m were set as a comparison and the other boundary conditions and parameter settings were not changed the transient seepage field and temperature field of the embankment dam when concentrated leakage occurred were simulated 4 results and discussion 4 1 research on water and heat transfer in embankment dams during concentrated leakage 4 1 1 head to study the influence of different heads on the law of water and heat transfer in embankment dams under concentrated leakage conditions the first second and third groups of experiments conditions 1 2 and 3 were selected for comparison by using the temperature data measured by 27 temperature sensors under 3 conditions the temperature field of the center section of the dam was displayed as shown in fig 3 with increasing time the temperature of the dam body gradually increased in the 3 conditions and the temperature changes upstream and around the leakage passage were the most obvious through comparison it could be seen that different heads have a significant impact on the temperature field of the dam with a leakage passage the higher the head was the faster the temperature around the leakage passage changed when the water level was 0 3 m the change in the temperature field around the entire leakage passage could be clearly seen from 90 min which is much earlier than the condition of the 0 2 m water level and later than the condition of the 0 4 m water level according to the seepage discharge data measured in the experiments the curves of the seepage discharge per unit width of the embankment dam under different heads with time were drawn as shown in fig 4 a the seepage discharge per unit width of the embankment dam under the 3 conditions hardly changed when the experiments were carried out for 130 min which proved that the leakage of the embankment dam was stable at this time a higher head meant earlier leakage of the dam body and a larger seepage discharge per unit width of the embankment dam when the seepage was stable 4 1 2 water temperature to study the influence of different water temperatures on the law of water and heat transfer in embankment dams under concentrated leakage conditions the fourth fifth and sixth groups of experiments conditions 4 5 and 6 were selected for comparison the drawing of the temperature field of the dam is shown in fig 3 the temperature field in the center and the downstream section of the dam changed when experiment conditions 5 and 6 were carried out for 30 min and condition 4 was carried out for 90 min which indicated that the higher the water temperature was the faster the temperature field of the embankment dam changed the change curve of the seepage discharge per unit width of the embankment dam with time under the 3 conditions is shown in fig 4b the leakage time of the dam under the 3 conditions was approximately the same and the seepage discharge per unit width was stable when the experiments were carried out for 120 min the higher the water temperature was the larger the seepage discharge per unit width of the embankment dam would be when it was stable 4 1 3 leakage passage height to study the influence of different leakage passage heights on the law of water and heat transfer in embankment dams under concentrated leakage conditions the third fifth and seventh groups of experiments conditions 3 5 and 7 were selected for comparison a drawing of the temperature field of the dam is shown in fig 3 when there was no leakage passage that is no concentrated leakage occurred the temperature field of the dam changed normally over time the temperature of the downstream section was always close to the ambient temperature when the height of the leakage passage was 0 1 m the temperature field in the downstream section of the dam body changed significantly and the temperature distribution was uniform at 300 min when the height of the leakage passage was 0 2 m the changes in the temperature field around the leakage passage could be clearly seen from 90 min and the temperature gradually rose over time the change curve of the seepage discharge per unit width of the embankment dam with time under the 3 conditions is shown in fig 4c when there was a leakage passage in the dam body the leakage time of the two conditions was roughly the same and the seepage discharge per unit width stabilized after 120 min from the beginning of the experiments the stable seepage discharge per unit width of the leakage passage at a height of 0 1 m was greater than that at a height of 0 2 m however when there was no leakage passage in the dam the seepage discharge per unit width stabilized after 30 min from the beginning of the experiment and the stable seepage discharge per unit width was much smaller than the other two conditions 4 2 model test and comparative analysis the condition 5 was taken as the prototype for numerical simulation the flow heat coupling model under 10 types of tcems was tested and compared 4 2 1 test of the seepage field the laboratory experiment device was equipped with piezometer tubes which could reflect the change of the piezometer tube head in real time during the experiments and the dam body saturated lines can be obtained comparing the simulated saturated lines of the flow heat coupling models based on 10 tcems with the measured saturated lines as shown in fig 5 it could be seen that the simulated saturated lines of the flow heat coupling models based on 10 tcems were in good agreement with the measured saturated lines among which the johansen 1975 model chung and horton 1987 model and power law model performed better than others 4 2 2 test of the temperature field the simulated values of measurement points ts13 ts14 ts15 ts19 ts20 and ts21 were selected from the field point probe temperature dataset the reason for the selection is that the length of the seepage path is positively correlated with the experiment error we assume that the dam body is homogeneous and isotropic fig 6 shows a fitting diagram of the simulated temperature data of 10 tcems with the measured temperature data of the laboratory experiment all 10 tcems could simulate the temperature field of the dam body accurately but the accuracy of each model was significantly different table 6 shows the calculated values of r2 rmse and re of the 10 models at the selected 6 measuring points to intuitively reflect the fitting effect of the models at each measuring point the content of table 6 was displayed in the form of a radar chart as shown in fig 7 the performance of the models at each measurement point was significantly different for example for measuring point ts19 the simulation accuracy of the johansen 1975 model and volume average model was relatively high while the simulation accuracy of the cÃ´tÃ© and konrad 2005 model and zhao et al 2019 model was low for measuring point ts20 the simulation accuracy of the johansen 1975 model chung and horton 1987 model ewen and thomas 1987 model volume average model reciprocal average model and power law model was all relatively high while the simulation accuracy of the cÃ´tÃ© and konrad 2005 model and zhao et al 2019 model was low in addition we found that compared with the other 5 measuring points the simulated values of the 10 models at ts21 had a large deviation from the measured values a possible explanation was that the other 5 measuring points all changed from the unsaturated zone to the saturated zone while ts21 was always in the unsaturated zone so the response to the tcems which changed with the change in water content was poor to further evaluate the models the mean values of the three evaluation indicators were plotted as shown in fig 8 among the first 7 empirical models the johansen 1975 model chung and horton 1987 model and ewen and thomas 1987 model have relatively high simulation accuracy through a comprehensive analysis of 3 evaluation indicators it was found that the chung and horton 1987 model performed best even better than the built in comsol models while the performance of the other 4 empirical models was average among which the cÃ´tÃ© and konrad 2005 model and zhao et al 2019 model had large deviations between the simulated values and the measured values among the 3 built in comsol models the power law model showed the best performance which is consistent with the conclusion of zhang et al 2020a b from a global perspective as shown in fig 9 the symbols of the johansen 1975 model the chung and horton 1987 model and the ewen and thomas 1987 model were in a narrower range along the 1 1 line and they had high correlation coefficient values the performance was as good as that of the 3 built in software models from the above results the flow heat coupling model under the chung and horton 1987 model is more accurate to simulate the temperature field of embankment dam by comparing the simulated temperature field based on this model with the measured temperature data the abnormal seepage position can be found more accurately which provides theoretical basis for the danger removal and reinforcement of embankment dam 4 3 analysis of the leakage law and temperature field response of embankment dams under dynamic water levels the built in comsol tcems were replaced by the chung and horton 1987 model the improved flow heat coupling model was used to calculate the seepage field of the embankment dam under 5 dynamic water levels as shown in fig 10 after leakage occurred the flow lines in the leakage passage gradually became denser the flow velocity increased and the saturated line rose at the same time the change in the water level affects the leakage rate and the rise and fall of the saturated line to intuitively reflect the impact of water level changes on the seepage field at the leakage passage a domain point probe was set in the model to monitor the pressure value and flow velocity changes in real time the position of the domain point probe is shown in fig 11 and the coordinates are 0 8 0 2 the pressure value calculated by the model was plotted as shown in fig 12 a between approximately 0 25 min the pressure at the measuring point in each condition showed a rapid rising trend and the rising speed of the two conditions with an initial water level of 0 4 m was faster than that of the other three conditions therefore at approximately 25 min the pressure of these two conditions was greater than that of the other three conditions in the next 50 min the pressure of each measuring point rose at a relatively small speed after approximately 75 min the pressure at the measuring point showed different trends with the change in the water level in each condition the pressures of the 0 3 m and 0 4 m water level conditions were maintained at approximately 730 pa and 1750 pa respectively under the condition of a rising water level the pressure at the measuring point continued to increase at a smaller rate and increased to approximately 1500 pa at 300 min under the condition of a falling water level the pressure at the measuring point continued to decrease at the same speed and decreased to approximately 830 pa at 300 min the pressure in the condition of a sinusoidal water level also roughly presented the shape of a sine curve the flow velocity change at the measuring point is shown in fig 12b at the beginning of leakage the flow velocity at the measuring point of each condition rose rapidly and the higher the initial water head was the greater the acceleration was and the greater the peak flow velocity was after reaching the peak value the flow velocity at the measuring point of each condition showed a downward trend and then tended to be stable the higher the initial water head was the greater the acceleration was and the lower the steady flow velocity was compared with the condition of the 0 4 m water level the fall of water level would cause the steady flow velocity to decrease by approximately 3 5 10 5m s even smaller than the condition of the 0 3 m water level compared with the working condition of the 0 3 m water level the rise of water level would cause the steady flow velocity to increase by approximately 5 10 5m s even greater than the condition of the 0 4 m water level under the working condition of a sinusoidal water level the flow velocity in the leakage passage also fluctuated roughly in the same form compared with the condition where the water level rises and falls at a constant speed the faster the water level changed the larger the flow velocity value changed the existence of a seepage passage changes the seepage field of the embankment dam which will lead to changes in the temperature field of the embankment dam there are two forms of heat transfer in the embankment dam heat conduction and heat convection heat conduction mainly occurs in the vertical direction when the ground temperature changes by 15 the temperature change value at 5 m below the ground is 7 1 and the temperature change value at 10 m below the ground is 1 7 compared with heat conduction heat convection transfer is more obvious even if the water flow is small flow velocity of 10 6 10 7 m s it will have a greater impact on the temperature field therefore the water temperature is the dominant factor affecting the temperature change of the dam the temperature field of each condition calculated based on the improved flow heat coupling model is shown in fig 13 the temperature field responded well to the seepage field as a whole when the water level rose as the water head increased the flow velocity around the leakage passage increased the pressure rose rapidly and the temperature around the passage rose accordingly compared with the condition of the 0 3 m water level the high temperature area around the passage was larger but less than the condition of the 0 4 m water level while the situation was opposite when the water level fell for the condition of a sinusoidal water level the temperature field could also respond quickly to further prove the reliability of the conclusion the temperature values of the measuring points of each condition are plotted in fig 12c the temperature and pressure changes of the measuring point showed the same trend which was very obviously related to the water level change and had a certain degree of hysteresis a similar hysteresis also appeared in the study of song and yosef 2017 4 4 limitation of the research 4 4 1 the concentration points of abnormal temperature in fig 3 it is worth noting that when the height difference between the water level and the leakage passage was 0 2 m conditions 2 4 5 and 6 a concentration point of abnormal temperature appeared near the outlet of the leakage passage a probable explanation was that the leakage passage set up in the experiments did not penetrate the dam body when the seepage water flowed through the passage to the drainage prism it stagnated or even flowed back due to the blockage of sand the seepage velocity is positively correlated with water head when the flow rate is small the gaps between the sand particles ensure that seepage flows through in a timely manner and does not cause erosion damage to sand samples when the flow rate is large the erosion of the sand sample by the water flow increases and the gaps between the particles increase it can be seen that with the increase of water head and seepage velocity the seepage will gather at the downstream of the embankment dam through the centralized leakage passage which is not conducive to the stability of the embankment dam therefore the leakage monitoring of the embankment dam is very necessary 4 4 2 the under estimation of the saturated lines in fig 5 in the downstream section of the embankment dam the simulated saturated line of the flow heat coupling model under any thermal conductivity empirical model is lower than the measured saturated line it is almost certain that this is because the size of the drainage prism in the experiment is too small or the drainage capacity is poor the leakage water cannot be discharged from the dam in time and the water silts downstream of the dam resulting in the rise of the saturated line from the perspective of dam risk analysis this means dam weakening we suggest that good drainage measures must be set in laboratory experiments or engineering construction which is very important to the stability of the dam 4 4 3 jump of measured temperature series in fig 6 it is obvious that the temperature jumps at about t 210 min the temperature increases for ts13 14 15 20 21 but decreases for ts19 the possible reason is the error in water temperature control because the room temperature is lower than the experimental water temperature the heat diffusion leads to a short maintenance time of the experimental water temperature and with the water infiltration the water level in front of the dam decreases we need to add constant temperature water regularly to maintain the water temperature and water level which causes a certain error to the experiment when preparing thermostatic water the water temperature in the upper layer may be low and that in the lower layer may be high due to uneven mixing ts19 is located in the outermost layer of the dam and is very sensitive to the infiltration of low temperature water in the upper layer so the measured value of temperature decreases ts13 14 15 20 21 are located in the inner layer of the dam body when the seepage flow passes through these positions it has been mixed evenly and the temperature is slightly higher than the pore water temperature so the measured temperature rises however the transient temperature jump will not affect the evaluation results of the model and the results are still very convincing although the heat tracing method has the advantages of high efficiency sensitivity and low cost it still has many limitations in embankment dams leakage monitoring for example the arrangement of measuring points of point sensors is limited and it is often difficult to detect all the points when there are many centralized leakage areas in the embankment dams distributed optical fiber sensors can solve this problem to a certain extent and have great engineering application potential however for very long distance of the flow path or very slow flow velocity the water temperature signal might not be detected due to the energy dissipation therefore comprehensive analysis of embankment dam leakage by various methods such as resistivity method transient electromagnetic method etc can improve the reliability of detection results on the other hand the research only carried out numerical simulation for 2d laboratory model for the 3d large scale model or the case with real scale of dams the simplification of model details and the anisotropy of thermal conductivity need to be considered and the setting of boundary conditions on surface area needs to be studied which will become our next work in addition the layout of temperature sensors and the assessment of the necessary input parameters of tcem are also great challenges for 3d real scale embankment dams first of all for the completed embankment dams temperature sensors must be installed without affecting the normal operation of the embankment dams which will be an interesting question for the embankment dams during construction we recommend installing distributed optical fiber temperature sensors designing different layout methods and comparing the monitoring results to determine the best layout method secondly in the process of monitoring regular sampling and testing should be carried out to update the soil parameters in time and improve the accuracy of numerical simulation finally in order to avoid the error caused by too small temperature gradient between water and soil and ensure the accuracy of monitoring results the combination of seepage heat monitoring and other monitoring methods is a good idea 5 conclusions in this paper combined with thermal conductivity empirical models tcems the saturated unsaturated flow heat coupling model of embankment dams was established through laboratory sand tank experiments of concentrated leakage in embankment dams on the one hand the accuracy of the flow heat coupling model under 10 types of tcems was tested and compared and the chung and horton 1987 model shows better simulation effects on the other hand the effects of head water temperature and leakage passage height on the concentrated leakage of embankment dams were analyzed a high temperature and high water head have obvious promotion effects on the leakage of the embankment dam the smaller the distance between the leakage passage and the bottom of the dam is the faster the leakage rate is the flow heat coupling model was improved by modifying the comsol built in equation i e built in comsol model was replaced by the chung and horton 1987 model which further improved the accuracy of the flow heat coupling model in the numerical simulation of seepage heat monitoring based on the improved model the seepage field and temperature field of the embankment dam when concentrated seepage occurred under the conditions of rising falling and sine water level were numerically simulated when the water level changes the seepage field and temperature field of the embankment dam with concentrated leakage passage will also change accordingly the changes in the seepage passage are the most obvious and the pressure and temperature changes are strongly correlated with the water level changes this study still has many limitations the measured saturated lines and temperature data are not perfect due to improper setting of drainage prism and leakage passage in sand tank experiment but have little influence on the experimental results considering the simplification of model details the anisotropy of thermal conductivity and the setting of boundary conditions in surface area 3d numerical simulation on the case with real scale of dams is our next work credit authorship contribution statement shenghao nan

3502,the normal stress dependent hydraulic properties of single fractures are fundamental in hydro mechanical coupling for the fractured reservoirs with increasing normal stress fluid flow through single fractures decreases dramatically in the low stress range and then gradually in the high stress range respectively in order to describe this heterogeneous hydro mechanical behavior analytical relationships between normal stress and fluid flow for single fractures are established based on the two part hooke s model tphm in which the fracture aperture is conceptualized into two parts at a macro scale hard part and soft part the contributions of soft part and hard part apertures on the hydraulic properties are separately evaluated by the different mechanical properties with normal stress the validity of the proposed relationships between normal stress and fluid flow is verified by the good agreements between experimental data and theoretical predictions for natural and induced tensile fractures the significant reductions of permeability and flow rate at low stress are dominated by the soft part and the degree of their nonlinearity highly depends on the spatial correlation of fracture geometry in addition the irrecoverable fracture deformation and flow drop between loading cycles are also greatly affected by the soft part while the fracture modulus of the hard part exhibits a weak dependence on loading cycle the proposed relationships can be used to evaluate the coupled hydro mechanical processes in fractured rock engineering such as geothermal energy development co2 geologic sequestration and stability of fractured rock slope keywords fracture normal stress permeability flow rate two part hooke s model 1 introduction fractures are ubiquitous in many geologic formations and can provide high permeability flow pathways for fluid flow in many practical applications such as geothermal energy development zhao 1994 chen and zhao 2020 yao et al 2020a b co2 geologic sequestration chang et al 2020 chang et al 2021 seepage flow in the fractured rock slope ye et al 2020 2021a ye et al 2021b c xiong et al 2020 wei et al 2021 oil and gas exploitation li et al 2017 and nuclear waste disposal liu et al 1998 kwon et al 2020 in the condition of field stress fluid flow of single fractures is acutely affected by the compression of void space and growth of contact area the related normal stress dependent hydraulic properties are fundamental in modeling coupled hydro mechanical processes in the fractured reservoirs many researchers have investigated the normal stress dependence of hydraulic properties through single fractures by experimental and theoretical approaches the hydro mechanical behavior of natural and induced tensile fractures in granite basalt shale sandstone amphibolite and marble rock samples subject to normal stress were conducted by barton et al 1985 brown et al 1986 gale 1982 raven and gale 1985 witherspoon et al 1980 zhao 1994 pyrak nolte et al 1987 durham 1997 gutierrez et al 2000 lee and cho 2002 watanabe et al 2008 cuss et al 2011 chen et al 2017 kulatilake et al 2020 and cardona et al 2021 it is commonly observed that the fluid flow decreases sharply at low stress at first and then gradually at high stress respectively in order to predict the permeability change with normal stress of single fractures several physical models were established such as the bed of nails model by gangi 1978 void asperity model by tsang and witherspoon 1981 effective pressure model by walsh 1981 aperture frequency model by neuzil and tracy 1981 and hertzian contact model by swan 1983 as a result power barton et al 1985 chen et al 2017 gangi 1978 kulatilake et al 2020 raven and gale 1985 witherspoon et al 1980 pyrak nolte et al 1987 exponential gutierrez et al 2000 and logarithmic walsh 1981 swan 1983 zhao 1994 laws as a function of normal stress were generally developed to describe the normal stress dependent hydraulic properties in single fractures however the relevant parameters of these empirical relationships cannot provide physically robust meaning for the nonlinear hydraulic behavior of single fractures such as the negative value of hydraulic aperture chen et al 2017 some of the assumptions conflict with the reality such as the little effect of surface roughness on the fluid flow gangi 1978 the random spatial distribution of the aperture variation tsang and witherspoon 1981 the discrepancies between these models and measurements are also very apparent for example the data from zhao and brown 1992 are generally higher than that of the bed of nails model by gangi 1978 in this study we therefore intend to develop an analytical model that is more physical reasonable and to properly describe the overall trends for normal stress dependent hydraulic properties due to the increase of normal stress the decreased aperture and increased contact area can lead to flow reduction because of the more tortuous flow pathways and less cross sectional area intuitively the two different hydraulic behaviors remarkable flow drop in low stress range and unremarkable flow reduction in high stress range may be controlled by different mechanisms as indicated by liu et al 2009 liu et al 2011 liu and rutqvist 2013 the hydraulic and mechanical properties of natural fractures can be better characterized by a heterogeneous system because of the structure heterogeneity such as the tphm therefore the primary purpose in this study is to establish the analytical relationships between the normal stress and fluid flow in single fractures and evaluate their validity with existing measured data in natural and induced tensile fractures this study is organized as follows in section 2 the theoretical derivations of the normal stress dependent permeability and flow rate are presented firstly based on the tphm in section 3 the proposed analytical relationships are validated by the comparisons with experimental data 2 theory 2 1 normal stress aperture relationships based on the tphm firstly the tphm developed by liu et al 2009 is demonstrated here in tradition the elastic stress strain relationship in porous and fractured rock is generally governed by the linear hooke s law which was originally found by robert hooke in 1676 and illustrated the strain of homogeneous material increases linearly with the stress in fact natural rock is inherently heterogeneous including pores and fractures the linear hooke s law is invalid to hold the stress dependent elastic mechanical behaviors between stress and strain in many applications jaeger et al 2007 liu et al 2009 the elastic deformation of a portion of pores and fractures can be relatively large and is highly sensitive to the low stress while the elastic strain of other part can be indeed small for stress changes to address the heterogeneous mechanical behavior of natural rock the rock was divided into two parts hard part and soft part it is assumed that the soft part subject to a portion of pore volume or fracture apertures is controlled by the true strain based hooke s law and the residual part called hard part is approximated by the engineering strain based hooke s law because of small deformation liu et al 2009 the true strain is defined as the ratio of volume change to rock volume at current stress state and engineering strain is defined as the ratio of volume change to the unstressed rock volume respectively even more vividly the tphm can be compared to a complex spring system as presented in fig 1 the mechanical behavior of the hard spring is governed by the engineering strain based hooke s law while that of the soft spring is governed by true strain based hooke s law with consideration of heterogeneity of natural rock the tphm can successfully capture the heterogeneous mechanical and hydraulic processes a number of mechanical and hydraulic parameters are derived on the basis of nonlinear stress strain relationships such as bulk rock compressibility pore compressibility rock porosity bulk modulus developed by liu et al 2009 the three dimensional stress strain relationship under anisotropic stress conditions derived by zhao and liu 2012 the mechanical aperture saturation capillary and relative permeability for two phase flow in single fractures proposed by liu et al 2013 the porosity and permeability for low permeability sedimentary rock deduced by zheng et al 2015 the theoretical predictions from the tphm showed remarkable consistency with the experimental observations in addition the tphm has been applied to several engineering such as permeability evaluation in three valencia canyon coalbed wells liu and rutqvist 2010 geological sequestration problem coupled hydro mechanical processes associated with co2 geological sequestration in salah gas project liu and rutqvist 2013 and the mine by test at mont terri site li et al 2014 similar to the porous and fractured rock the heterogeneous normal stress dependent behaviors of fracture aperture and closure are also observed based on the tphm fracture aperture is conceptualized into a hard part and a soft part at a macro scale as well the soft part of fracture consists of a portion of apertures sensitive to low stress and a small fraction of contact areas whereas the hard part of fracture represents the rest aperture and contact area note that the effective normal stress is referred as normal stress in the following text for a rock fracture subject to a normal stress Ï the volumetrically averaged fracture aperture b under stressed condition is expressed by 1 b b e b t where b e and b t are the fracture aperture for the hard and soft parts respectively in this work the subscripts e and t refer to the hard part and the soft part respectively for the soft part of fracture the true strain based hooke s law can be defined as 2 d Ï k t d Îµ v t k t d v t v t k t d b t b t where k t Îµ v t and v t are the fracture modulus true strain and volume for the soft part respectively integrating eq 2 and the initial condition b t b 0 t for Ï 0 yields 3 b t b 0 t exp Ï k t where b 0 t is the initial aperture of the soft part under the unstressed condition and the subscripts 0 refers to the unstressed state similarly the engineering strain based hooke s law for the hard part of fracture follows 4 d Ï k e d Îµ v e k e d v e v 0 e k e d b e b 0 e where k e Îµ v e v e v 0 e and b 0 e are the fracture modulus engineering strain volume unstressed volume and unstressed aperture for the hard part respectively integrating eq 4 and the initial condition b e b 0 e for Ï 0 gives 5 b e b 0 e 1 Ï k e combining eqs 1 3 and 5 the tphm based stress aperture relationship can be obtained as 6 b b 0 e 1 Ï k e b 0 t exp Ï k t then based on eq 6 and using the initial condition b 0 b 0 e b 0 t for Ï 0 the fracture closure Ï can be written as 7 Ï b 0 b b 0 e Ï k e b 0 t 1 exp Ï k t thus the normal stress dependence of fracture aperture and closure are given in eqs 6 and 7 which are dominated by the linear term at high stress for hard part and nonlinear term at low stress for soft part respectively as pointed by liu et al 2009 because k t is much smaller than k e the soft part aperture turns to be much more compliant and its deformation becomes considerably large at low stress state in contrast the soft part aperture can be ignored at high stress state because exp Ï k t 0 for Ï k t 2 2 normal stress dependence of fluid flow fracture apertures are inherently heterogeneous and thus their nonlinear hydraulic behaviors are better described using a heterogeneous system as well as the mechanical behaviors in order to describe the different degrees of hydraulic properties contributed by different normal stresses the effect of soft part and hard part apertures on the hydraulic properties can be evaluated separately corresponding to the different mechanical properties with normal stress at a macro scale according to eq 6 the soft part of fracture aperture is negligible for high stress thus the effect of high stress on the fluid flow is predominated by the fracture aperture of hard part for the laminar flow in a smooth parallel plate fracture fracture permeability is determined by the cubic law lomize 1951 as suggested by witherspoon et al 1980 and elliott and brown 1988 the cubic law was found to be valid for deformable fractures with apertures as small as 4 15Î¼m at high stress conditions raven and gale 1985 also showed water flow through fracture samples 1 and 2 cycle 1 could be well plotted by the cubic law at high stress note that fracture aperture refers to mechanical aperture rather than hydraulic aperture calculated inversely from the cubic law in general the relationships between mechanical aperture and hydraulic aperture can be describe by the modified cubic law by introducing correction factor with consideration of fracture roughness and contact area which leads to that fracture permeability is proportional to the square of the fracture aperture if the unstressed permeability k0 e of hard part is known for the unstressed aperture b0 e the stress dependent permeability ke at different stresses contributed by the hard part could be given mathematically in a simple way 8 k e k 0 e b e b 0 e 2 substituting eq 5 into eq 8 gives 9 k e k 0 e 1 Ï k e 2 conversely the hard part of fracture aperture exhibits the small amount of displacement with larger ke for low stress values based on eq 7 compared with the relative large deformation of the soft part aperture therefore it can be reasonably concluded that the changes of hydraulic properties in low stress range is primarily governed by the soft part the fracture heterogeneity can generally lead to a deviation from the cubic law where the values of the exponents between fluid flow and aperture based on the power law were between 7 6 and 9 8 by pyrak nolte et al 1987 6 by barton et al 1985 and between 4 03 and 6 47 by kulatilake et al 2020 in this case the permeability of the soft part kt can be stated as 10 k t k 0 t b t b 0 t n where k t and k 0 t are the soft part permeabilities under the stressed and unstressed states respectively n is a material constant inserting eq 3 into eq 10 yields 11 k t k 0 t exp Ï k t n k 0 t exp n Ï k t the total permeability of fracture is the sum of the hard and soft part permeabilities which can be written as 12 k k e k t k 0 e 1 Ï k e 2 k 0 t exp n Ï k t nevertheless it is easier to directly measure the flow rate rather than permeability during hydro mechanical coupling experiment which is given by witherspoon et al 1980 13 q e b e 3 14 q t b t n 1 combining eqs 13 14 the flow rate q of fracture yields 15 q e q 0 e 1 Ï k e 3 16 q t q 0 t exp m Ï k t 17 q q e q t q 0 e 1 Ï k e 3 q 0 t exp m Ï k t where q e q 0 e q t and q 0 t are the flow rate of the hard and soft parts under the stressed and unstressed states respectively m is a material constant with m n 1 according to eq 16 the flow rate of the soft part changes exponentially with normal stress corresponding to the stress sensitive drops of flow rate in the low stress state because of the relatively larger closure of the soft part aperture as demonstrated by previous studies pyrak nolte and morris 2000 ye et al 2017 li et al 2019 kulatilake et al 2020 xiong et al 2021 the mechanical and hydraulic behaviors through rough walled fractures are mainly affected by its spatial distribution of fracture geometry in other words m in eq 16 as a stress sensitive coefficient to quantify the nonlinearity of the hydraulic behavior in the low stress state depends on how the soft part apertures are connected with each other and with hard part apertures in the next section the proposed equations here will be validated with the experimental observations 3 verification of the proposed relationship between normal stress and fluid flow to evaluate the validity of the proposed relationships between the normal stress permeability and flow rate in eqs 12 and 17 experimental observations from three typical hydro mechanical tests performed by zhao 1994 pyrak nolte et al 1987 and kulatilake et al 2020 are selected to verify the proposed relationships the normal stress dependent flow experiments were performed on both natural artificial correlated and uncorrelated rough fractures 3 1 natural and artificial fractures in the carnmenellis granite according to the hydro mechanical experiments performed by zhao 1994 geothermal rock mechanics testing system was employed to measure the fracture deformation and permeability of natural and artificially induced extension fractures in the carnmenellis granite the maximum axial loads confining pressure pore pressure and temperature could reach 2 67mn 140 mpa 105 mpa and 400 c respectively one pair of cantilevers perpendicular to the fracture plane were positioned at the mid height of the rock sample to measure the deformations of the total sample and of the rock matrix the fracture closure was equal to the difference between the total deformation of sample and the deformation of the rock matrix fluid flow was driven by the upstream and downstream accumulators and the injection and back up pressures were monitored by the differential pressure transducers the hydro mechanical experiment at different differential pressures in the rock fracture was kept in laminar condition and repeated 5 15 times at each confining pressure thus the normal stress closure permeability data sets of the natural and artificial fractures could be obtained since the fracture permeability under zero effective stress k 0 is not given from zhao 1994 eq 12 can be represented as 18 k k 1 e 1 Î´ Ï k e 2 k 1 t exp n Î´ Ï k t where k 1 e is the permeability of the hard part at the lowest observed normal stress and follows k 1 e k 0 e 1 Ï 1 k e 2 the subscript 1 here refers to the lowest normal stress Î´ Ï Ï Ï 1 k 1 t is the permeability of the soft part at Ï 1 and follows k 1 t k 0 t exp n Ï 1 k t note that the approximate eq 18 is resulted by 1 Ï 1 k e 1 when Ï 1 approaches zero there are seven parameters in eqs 7 and 18 a fitting procedure is adopted to ensure the uniqueness of parameter values in normal stress dependent closure and permeability curves as plotted in fig 2 a the growth between fracture closure and normal stress can be approximated by a linear trend at high stress state according to eq 7 this line slope can be calculated as b 0 e k e because the exponential term on the right hand side is ignored at high stress state the intersection of the straight line with the closure axis gives the value of b 0 t then k t can be calculated from a data point at a low stress state similar procedure can be applied to calculate the rest parameters in eq 18 as shown in fig 2 b at high stress the permeability contributed by the soft part approaches zero and therefore the permeability is a second power function of stress when two data points Ï Î± k Î± and Ï Î² k Î² at high stress are selected k e Ï Î² k Î² k Î± 1 2 Ï Î± 1 k Î² k Î± 1 2 k 1 e k Î± 1 Ï Î± k e 2 and k 1 t k 1 k 1 e can be obtained using eqs 12 and 18 once the permeability of the hard part is obtained the permeability of the soft part can be quantified by the difference between the measured permeability and the hard part permeability then the permeability of the soft part is a function of the normal stress with ln k t ln k 1 t n Î´ Ï k t which yields the proportionality n k t the permeability of the soft part and normal stress relationship is presented in fig 2 b with permeability plotted in logarithm the line slope red dash line in fig 2 b yields the values of n k t which leads to the determination of n when k t is known by fitting the normal stress closure data the value n of for different samples are also labeled in the figures figs 2 and 3 show the comparisons of closure and permeability between the measured data and theoretical predictions in the natural and artificial fractures the fitted values of b 0 e b 0 t k e k t k 1 e k 1 t n and the related correlation coefficient of curve fitting r 2 are listed in table 1 the normal stress closure and normal stress flow rate analytical curves based on the tphm are in reasonable agreements with the measurements in the normal stress closure and normal stress permeability figures the comparisons between the hard and soft part closures and permeabilities are also presented it is found that the soft part has a larger closure and permeability than the hard part at low stress and is the main influential factors of the high nonlinearity of mechanical and hydraulic behaviors even though the unstressed aperture of the soft part from 0 0509 to 0 0944 mm is about as large as that of the hard part from 0 0585 to 0 1054 mm for comparison the predictions of the power model k a Ï b from gale 1982 and logarithmic model k k 0 c d ln Ï 2 from swan 1983 are also plotted in the figures where a b c and d are is material constants k 0 is the initial permeability under the unstressed state the power curves are generally higher than the test data and the deviation of the logarithmic model is also quite apparent at high stress range the performances of the power and logarithmic models are much poorer than the proposed normal stress permeability relationship in addition the flaw of these two functions is also obvious in which the power and logarithmic models give zero and infinite permeability values respectively as the normal stress approaches zero with increasing normal stress the curve slope of the soft part closure becomes more gradual and almost remains unchanged at high stress while the hard part closure maintains a linear upward trend note that the fitted values of the soft part modulus k t from 0 8342 to 1 03 mpa are relatively smaller than that of the hard part modulus k e from 14 4377 to 28 7928 mpa which indicates that the nonlinear deformation at low stress is principally contributed by the soft part apertures as a consequence the nonlinear reduction of the permeability at low stress significantly depends on the deformation of the soft part apertures which suggests that the tphm can adequately represent the experimental observations on the normal stress dependence of permeability including the nonlinear relation at low stress state the fitted n value for the artificial fracture is 4 24 lower than that 2 41 for the natural fracture subjected to alteration and mismatching due to mechanical and chemical weathering the curve slope of the artificial fracture is steeper than that of natural fracture which indicates that the permeability changes with the normal stress have obvious sensitivity of fracture geometry 3 2 correlated and uncorrelated fracture experiments in the quartz monzonite in order to investigate the effect of aperture correlation on the normal stress dependence of hydraulic properties in low permeability rock the measured mechanical and hydraulic dataset provided by pyrak nolte et al 1987 are employed to evaluate the proposed relationships between normal stress closure and flow rate to obtain the mechanical displacement and flow rate data at different stresses the hydro mechanical experiments were carried out on the fracture samples e30 and e32 with 52 mm in diameter and 77 mm in height a test machine was used to apply an axial load to the specimen and the effective stress was kept constant the fracture closure was determined by the measured displacement difference between the four precision linear variable differential transformers attached in pairs on diametrically opposed sides of the sample a linear flow technique quadrant flow was applied to measure flow rate with an upstream pressure of 0 4 mpa the fracture void geometry and contact area with various stresses were obtained by a metal injection technique a scanning electron microscope sem and photographic techniques pronounced differences in the structure of shape size and distribution of contact area were observed by pyrak nolte et al 1987 the contact areas of e30 tended to be large and clustered whereas those of e32 were smaller more numerous and elongate namely the aperture distributions of e30 and e32 were spatially correlated and uncorrelated respectively due to that the flow rate under zero effective stress q 0 is not given from pyrak nolte et al 1987 eq 17 can be rewritten as 19 q q 1 e 1 Î´ Ï k e 3 q 1 t exp m Î´ Ï k t where q 1 e is the flow rate of the hard part at the lowest observed normal stress and related to q 0 e by q 1 e q 0 e 1 Ï 1 k e 3 q 1 t is the flow rate of the soft part at Ï 1 and related to q 0 t by q 1 t q 0 t exp m Ï 1 k t the fitting procedure of normal stress dependent flow rate for single fractures is similar to the normal stress dependent permeability in the section 3 1 as shown in fig 4 b k e Ï Î² q Î² q Î± 1 3 Ï Î± 1 q Î² q Î± 1 3 q 1 e q Î± 1 Ï Î± k e 3 and q 1 t q 1 q 1 e can be obtained using eqs 17 and 19 when two data points Ï Î± q Î± and Ï Î² q Î² at high stress are selected then the flow rate of the soft part can be calculated by the difference between the total flow rate and the hard part flow rate and its line slope in logarithm yields the proportionality m k t the value of m is determined when k t is known by fitting the normal stress closure data the comparisons of the normal stress dependent closure and flow rate relationships between the measured and analytical results are presented in figs 4 and 5 which suggests that the theoretical predictions given by the proposed tphm based closure and flow rate functions agree quite well with the experimental observations the fitted values of undetermined parameters are listed in table 1 and r2 are both larger than 0 98 therefore the proposed relationships between normal stress closure and flow rate are verified through hydro mechanical analysis in correlated and uncorrelated fractures e30 and e32 and the tphm is valid to describe the normal stress sensitivity of flow rate in single fractures according to eq 16 the larger the values of m the greater reduction of flow rate in low stress range the curve slope m of the correlated sample e30 6 21 is larger than that of the uncorrelated sample e32 3 50 as shown in the soft part flow rate curves in figs 4 and 5 which indicates that the spatial correlation of fracture geometry plays an important role in determining the parameter m this is because for a spatially correlated fracture the occurrence of the soft part closure subject to the low stress is compact and the few limited dominant flow paths lead to the rapid decrease of flow rate while the closure of the uncorrelated soft part is randomly scattered and multiple connected flow paths can support the relatively gradual change with the low stress which is in accord with the results of pyrak nolte and morris 2000 3 3 natural rough fracture experiments under loading and unloading cycles to further validate the proposed normal stress flow rate relationship in natural fracture experiments with respect to loading and unloading cycles the datasets provided by kulatilake et al 2020 are considered the compression and flow tests were performed in granodiorite and quartz monzonite porphyry samples with natural fractures and subjected to three uniaxial compressive loading and unloading cycles in each loading and unloading cycles the fracture closure was measured by a set of eight lvdts prior to the flow testing at any given normal load level the fracture sample was wax sealed firstly and then water was injected at a constant head through a gas regulator the flow rate was measured by an electronic flow meter under a steady state flow condition each test was repeated at least 3 times the experimental data matched with the proposed relationships between normal stress closure and flow rate are shown in figs 6 8 the parameters for the fitted curves are given in table 1 the analytical curves based on the tphm can satisfactorily represent experimental observations for all loading and unloading cycles and the values of r 2 are both larger than 0 98 likewise the increase of fracture closure and decrease of flow rate in each loading cycle are pronounced at low stress and become more gradual at high stress as the loading cycle number increases the values of b 0 e and b 0 t decrease slightly from 0 1467 to 0 1293 mm and rapidly from 0 3602 to 0 1809 mm corresponding to the small change in q 1 e and large change in q 1 t meanwhile k t increases from 0 7637 to 1 2295 mpa and m decreases slightly from 5 73 to 4 92 with increasing loading cycle number except that the value of k e does not change noticeably which indicates that the soft part has a significant influence on the irrecoverable fracture deformation and flow drop between loading cycles 4 conclusions concerning the normal stress dependent hydraulic behavior of single fractures the tphm is employed to conceptually divide fracture aperture into a hard part and a soft part at a macroscopic scale and then to describe different degree of hydraulic properties of single fractures subject to normal stress where rapid descent at low stress and slow descent at high stress are presented with the consideration of different effect of soft part and hard part apertures on the hydraulic properties associated with the different mechanical properties subject to normal stress analytical relationships between normal stress and fluid flow for single fractures are derived the validity of the proposed relationships has been verified by three kinds of experimental data from literature and good agreements between the theoretical results and the measurement are obtained the soft part is responsible for the significant reduction of permeability at low stress because of the larger closure and permeability than the hard part at low stress state and the degree of permeability and flow reduction with the normal stress has obvious sensitivity of fracture geometry when the fracture aperture is more correlated the closure of the soft part at low stress is more compact which may lead to remarkable reduction of flow cross section and great tortuousity of flow pathways rather than scatter distribution in the uncorrelated soft part during loading cycles the irrecoverable fracture deformation and flow drop are closely related to the soft part while the unstressed fracture aperture flow rate and modulus of the hard part are almost unaffected the focus of this paper is on the development of physically reasonable relationships for normal stress dependent fluid flow based on a simple and intuitive way of thinking at a macro scale however the deformation degrees of each local aperture and asperity are extremely different at a micro scale the permeability change with normal stress is heavily dependent on the spatial variation of aperture distribution and contact area at present it is hard to accurately target the locations of the soft and hard parts and quantitatively determine the effect of fracture geometry on the unknown parameters of the proposed model further experimental and numerical studies are required to relate the micro structure of single fractures to the macro hydro mechanical properties in the future work credit authorship contribution statement zuyang ye investigation conceptualization writing review

3502,the normal stress dependent hydraulic properties of single fractures are fundamental in hydro mechanical coupling for the fractured reservoirs with increasing normal stress fluid flow through single fractures decreases dramatically in the low stress range and then gradually in the high stress range respectively in order to describe this heterogeneous hydro mechanical behavior analytical relationships between normal stress and fluid flow for single fractures are established based on the two part hooke s model tphm in which the fracture aperture is conceptualized into two parts at a macro scale hard part and soft part the contributions of soft part and hard part apertures on the hydraulic properties are separately evaluated by the different mechanical properties with normal stress the validity of the proposed relationships between normal stress and fluid flow is verified by the good agreements between experimental data and theoretical predictions for natural and induced tensile fractures the significant reductions of permeability and flow rate at low stress are dominated by the soft part and the degree of their nonlinearity highly depends on the spatial correlation of fracture geometry in addition the irrecoverable fracture deformation and flow drop between loading cycles are also greatly affected by the soft part while the fracture modulus of the hard part exhibits a weak dependence on loading cycle the proposed relationships can be used to evaluate the coupled hydro mechanical processes in fractured rock engineering such as geothermal energy development co2 geologic sequestration and stability of fractured rock slope keywords fracture normal stress permeability flow rate two part hooke s model 1 introduction fractures are ubiquitous in many geologic formations and can provide high permeability flow pathways for fluid flow in many practical applications such as geothermal energy development zhao 1994 chen and zhao 2020 yao et al 2020a b co2 geologic sequestration chang et al 2020 chang et al 2021 seepage flow in the fractured rock slope ye et al 2020 2021a ye et al 2021b c xiong et al 2020 wei et al 2021 oil and gas exploitation li et al 2017 and nuclear waste disposal liu et al 1998 kwon et al 2020 in the condition of field stress fluid flow of single fractures is acutely affected by the compression of void space and growth of contact area the related normal stress dependent hydraulic properties are fundamental in modeling coupled hydro mechanical processes in the fractured reservoirs many researchers have investigated the normal stress dependence of hydraulic properties through single fractures by experimental and theoretical approaches the hydro mechanical behavior of natural and induced tensile fractures in granite basalt shale sandstone amphibolite and marble rock samples subject to normal stress were conducted by barton et al 1985 brown et al 1986 gale 1982 raven and gale 1985 witherspoon et al 1980 zhao 1994 pyrak nolte et al 1987 durham 1997 gutierrez et al 2000 lee and cho 2002 watanabe et al 2008 cuss et al 2011 chen et al 2017 kulatilake et al 2020 and cardona et al 2021 it is commonly observed that the fluid flow decreases sharply at low stress at first and then gradually at high stress respectively in order to predict the permeability change with normal stress of single fractures several physical models were established such as the bed of nails model by gangi 1978 void asperity model by tsang and witherspoon 1981 effective pressure model by walsh 1981 aperture frequency model by neuzil and tracy 1981 and hertzian contact model by swan 1983 as a result power barton et al 1985 chen et al 2017 gangi 1978 kulatilake et al 2020 raven and gale 1985 witherspoon et al 1980 pyrak nolte et al 1987 exponential gutierrez et al 2000 and logarithmic walsh 1981 swan 1983 zhao 1994 laws as a function of normal stress were generally developed to describe the normal stress dependent hydraulic properties in single fractures however the relevant parameters of these empirical relationships cannot provide physically robust meaning for the nonlinear hydraulic behavior of single fractures such as the negative value of hydraulic aperture chen et al 2017 some of the assumptions conflict with the reality such as the little effect of surface roughness on the fluid flow gangi 1978 the random spatial distribution of the aperture variation tsang and witherspoon 1981 the discrepancies between these models and measurements are also very apparent for example the data from zhao and brown 1992 are generally higher than that of the bed of nails model by gangi 1978 in this study we therefore intend to develop an analytical model that is more physical reasonable and to properly describe the overall trends for normal stress dependent hydraulic properties due to the increase of normal stress the decreased aperture and increased contact area can lead to flow reduction because of the more tortuous flow pathways and less cross sectional area intuitively the two different hydraulic behaviors remarkable flow drop in low stress range and unremarkable flow reduction in high stress range may be controlled by different mechanisms as indicated by liu et al 2009 liu et al 2011 liu and rutqvist 2013 the hydraulic and mechanical properties of natural fractures can be better characterized by a heterogeneous system because of the structure heterogeneity such as the tphm therefore the primary purpose in this study is to establish the analytical relationships between the normal stress and fluid flow in single fractures and evaluate their validity with existing measured data in natural and induced tensile fractures this study is organized as follows in section 2 the theoretical derivations of the normal stress dependent permeability and flow rate are presented firstly based on the tphm in section 3 the proposed analytical relationships are validated by the comparisons with experimental data 2 theory 2 1 normal stress aperture relationships based on the tphm firstly the tphm developed by liu et al 2009 is demonstrated here in tradition the elastic stress strain relationship in porous and fractured rock is generally governed by the linear hooke s law which was originally found by robert hooke in 1676 and illustrated the strain of homogeneous material increases linearly with the stress in fact natural rock is inherently heterogeneous including pores and fractures the linear hooke s law is invalid to hold the stress dependent elastic mechanical behaviors between stress and strain in many applications jaeger et al 2007 liu et al 2009 the elastic deformation of a portion of pores and fractures can be relatively large and is highly sensitive to the low stress while the elastic strain of other part can be indeed small for stress changes to address the heterogeneous mechanical behavior of natural rock the rock was divided into two parts hard part and soft part it is assumed that the soft part subject to a portion of pore volume or fracture apertures is controlled by the true strain based hooke s law and the residual part called hard part is approximated by the engineering strain based hooke s law because of small deformation liu et al 2009 the true strain is defined as the ratio of volume change to rock volume at current stress state and engineering strain is defined as the ratio of volume change to the unstressed rock volume respectively even more vividly the tphm can be compared to a complex spring system as presented in fig 1 the mechanical behavior of the hard spring is governed by the engineering strain based hooke s law while that of the soft spring is governed by true strain based hooke s law with consideration of heterogeneity of natural rock the tphm can successfully capture the heterogeneous mechanical and hydraulic processes a number of mechanical and hydraulic parameters are derived on the basis of nonlinear stress strain relationships such as bulk rock compressibility pore compressibility rock porosity bulk modulus developed by liu et al 2009 the three dimensional stress strain relationship under anisotropic stress conditions derived by zhao and liu 2012 the mechanical aperture saturation capillary and relative permeability for two phase flow in single fractures proposed by liu et al 2013 the porosity and permeability for low permeability sedimentary rock deduced by zheng et al 2015 the theoretical predictions from the tphm showed remarkable consistency with the experimental observations in addition the tphm has been applied to several engineering such as permeability evaluation in three valencia canyon coalbed wells liu and rutqvist 2010 geological sequestration problem coupled hydro mechanical processes associated with co2 geological sequestration in salah gas project liu and rutqvist 2013 and the mine by test at mont terri site li et al 2014 similar to the porous and fractured rock the heterogeneous normal stress dependent behaviors of fracture aperture and closure are also observed based on the tphm fracture aperture is conceptualized into a hard part and a soft part at a macro scale as well the soft part of fracture consists of a portion of apertures sensitive to low stress and a small fraction of contact areas whereas the hard part of fracture represents the rest aperture and contact area note that the effective normal stress is referred as normal stress in the following text for a rock fracture subject to a normal stress Ï the volumetrically averaged fracture aperture b under stressed condition is expressed by 1 b b e b t where b e and b t are the fracture aperture for the hard and soft parts respectively in this work the subscripts e and t refer to the hard part and the soft part respectively for the soft part of fracture the true strain based hooke s law can be defined as 2 d Ï k t d Îµ v t k t d v t v t k t d b t b t where k t Îµ v t and v t are the fracture modulus true strain and volume for the soft part respectively integrating eq 2 and the initial condition b t b 0 t for Ï 0 yields 3 b t b 0 t exp Ï k t where b 0 t is the initial aperture of the soft part under the unstressed condition and the subscripts 0 refers to the unstressed state similarly the engineering strain based hooke s law for the hard part of fracture follows 4 d Ï k e d Îµ v e k e d v e v 0 e k e d b e b 0 e where k e Îµ v e v e v 0 e and b 0 e are the fracture modulus engineering strain volume unstressed volume and unstressed aperture for the hard part respectively integrating eq 4 and the initial condition b e b 0 e for Ï 0 gives 5 b e b 0 e 1 Ï k e combining eqs 1 3 and 5 the tphm based stress aperture relationship can be obtained as 6 b b 0 e 1 Ï k e b 0 t exp Ï k t then based on eq 6 and using the initial condition b 0 b 0 e b 0 t for Ï 0 the fracture closure Ï can be written as 7 Ï b 0 b b 0 e Ï k e b 0 t 1 exp Ï k t thus the normal stress dependence of fracture aperture and closure are given in eqs 6 and 7 which are dominated by the linear term at high stress for hard part and nonlinear term at low stress for soft part respectively as pointed by liu et al 2009 because k t is much smaller than k e the soft part aperture turns to be much more compliant and its deformation becomes considerably large at low stress state in contrast the soft part aperture can be ignored at high stress state because exp Ï k t 0 for Ï k t 2 2 normal stress dependence of fluid flow fracture apertures are inherently heterogeneous and thus their nonlinear hydraulic behaviors are better described using a heterogeneous system as well as the mechanical behaviors in order to describe the different degrees of hydraulic properties contributed by different normal stresses the effect of soft part and hard part apertures on the hydraulic properties can be evaluated separately corresponding to the different mechanical properties with normal stress at a macro scale according to eq 6 the soft part of fracture aperture is negligible for high stress thus the effect of high stress on the fluid flow is predominated by the fracture aperture of hard part for the laminar flow in a smooth parallel plate fracture fracture permeability is determined by the cubic law lomize 1951 as suggested by witherspoon et al 1980 and elliott and brown 1988 the cubic law was found to be valid for deformable fractures with apertures as small as 4 15Î¼m at high stress conditions raven and gale 1985 also showed water flow through fracture samples 1 and 2 cycle 1 could be well plotted by the cubic law at high stress note that fracture aperture refers to mechanical aperture rather than hydraulic aperture calculated inversely from the cubic law in general the relationships between mechanical aperture and hydraulic aperture can be describe by the modified cubic law by introducing correction factor with consideration of fracture roughness and contact area which leads to that fracture permeability is proportional to the square of the fracture aperture if the unstressed permeability k0 e of hard part is known for the unstressed aperture b0 e the stress dependent permeability ke at different stresses contributed by the hard part could be given mathematically in a simple way 8 k e k 0 e b e b 0 e 2 substituting eq 5 into eq 8 gives 9 k e k 0 e 1 Ï k e 2 conversely the hard part of fracture aperture exhibits the small amount of displacement with larger ke for low stress values based on eq 7 compared with the relative large deformation of the soft part aperture therefore it can be reasonably concluded that the changes of hydraulic properties in low stress range is primarily governed by the soft part the fracture heterogeneity can generally lead to a deviation from the cubic law where the values of the exponents between fluid flow and aperture based on the power law were between 7 6 and 9 8 by pyrak nolte et al 1987 6 by barton et al 1985 and between 4 03 and 6 47 by kulatilake et al 2020 in this case the permeability of the soft part kt can be stated as 10 k t k 0 t b t b 0 t n where k t and k 0 t are the soft part permeabilities under the stressed and unstressed states respectively n is a material constant inserting eq 3 into eq 10 yields 11 k t k 0 t exp Ï k t n k 0 t exp n Ï k t the total permeability of fracture is the sum of the hard and soft part permeabilities which can be written as 12 k k e k t k 0 e 1 Ï k e 2 k 0 t exp n Ï k t nevertheless it is easier to directly measure the flow rate rather than permeability during hydro mechanical coupling experiment which is given by witherspoon et al 1980 13 q e b e 3 14 q t b t n 1 combining eqs 13 14 the flow rate q of fracture yields 15 q e q 0 e 1 Ï k e 3 16 q t q 0 t exp m Ï k t 17 q q e q t q 0 e 1 Ï k e 3 q 0 t exp m Ï k t where q e q 0 e q t and q 0 t are the flow rate of the hard and soft parts under the stressed and unstressed states respectively m is a material constant with m n 1 according to eq 16 the flow rate of the soft part changes exponentially with normal stress corresponding to the stress sensitive drops of flow rate in the low stress state because of the relatively larger closure of the soft part aperture as demonstrated by previous studies pyrak nolte and morris 2000 ye et al 2017 li et al 2019 kulatilake et al 2020 xiong et al 2021 the mechanical and hydraulic behaviors through rough walled fractures are mainly affected by its spatial distribution of fracture geometry in other words m in eq 16 as a stress sensitive coefficient to quantify the nonlinearity of the hydraulic behavior in the low stress state depends on how the soft part apertures are connected with each other and with hard part apertures in the next section the proposed equations here will be validated with the experimental observations 3 verification of the proposed relationship between normal stress and fluid flow to evaluate the validity of the proposed relationships between the normal stress permeability and flow rate in eqs 12 and 17 experimental observations from three typical hydro mechanical tests performed by zhao 1994 pyrak nolte et al 1987 and kulatilake et al 2020 are selected to verify the proposed relationships the normal stress dependent flow experiments were performed on both natural artificial correlated and uncorrelated rough fractures 3 1 natural and artificial fractures in the carnmenellis granite according to the hydro mechanical experiments performed by zhao 1994 geothermal rock mechanics testing system was employed to measure the fracture deformation and permeability of natural and artificially induced extension fractures in the carnmenellis granite the maximum axial loads confining pressure pore pressure and temperature could reach 2 67mn 140 mpa 105 mpa and 400 c respectively one pair of cantilevers perpendicular to the fracture plane were positioned at the mid height of the rock sample to measure the deformations of the total sample and of the rock matrix the fracture closure was equal to the difference between the total deformation of sample and the deformation of the rock matrix fluid flow was driven by the upstream and downstream accumulators and the injection and back up pressures were monitored by the differential pressure transducers the hydro mechanical experiment at different differential pressures in the rock fracture was kept in laminar condition and repeated 5 15 times at each confining pressure thus the normal stress closure permeability data sets of the natural and artificial fractures could be obtained since the fracture permeability under zero effective stress k 0 is not given from zhao 1994 eq 12 can be represented as 18 k k 1 e 1 Î´ Ï k e 2 k 1 t exp n Î´ Ï k t where k 1 e is the permeability of the hard part at the lowest observed normal stress and follows k 1 e k 0 e 1 Ï 1 k e 2 the subscript 1 here refers to the lowest normal stress Î´ Ï Ï Ï 1 k 1 t is the permeability of the soft part at Ï 1 and follows k 1 t k 0 t exp n Ï 1 k t note that the approximate eq 18 is resulted by 1 Ï 1 k e 1 when Ï 1 approaches zero there are seven parameters in eqs 7 and 18 a fitting procedure is adopted to ensure the uniqueness of parameter values in normal stress dependent closure and permeability curves as plotted in fig 2 a the growth between fracture closure and normal stress can be approximated by a linear trend at high stress state according to eq 7 this line slope can be calculated as b 0 e k e because the exponential term on the right hand side is ignored at high stress state the intersection of the straight line with the closure axis gives the value of b 0 t then k t can be calculated from a data point at a low stress state similar procedure can be applied to calculate the rest parameters in eq 18 as shown in fig 2 b at high stress the permeability contributed by the soft part approaches zero and therefore the permeability is a second power function of stress when two data points Ï Î± k Î± and Ï Î² k Î² at high stress are selected k e Ï Î² k Î² k Î± 1 2 Ï Î± 1 k Î² k Î± 1 2 k 1 e k Î± 1 Ï Î± k e 2 and k 1 t k 1 k 1 e can be obtained using eqs 12 and 18 once the permeability of the hard part is obtained the permeability of the soft part can be quantified by the difference between the measured permeability and the hard part permeability then the permeability of the soft part is a function of the normal stress with ln k t ln k 1 t n Î´ Ï k t which yields the proportionality n k t the permeability of the soft part and normal stress relationship is presented in fig 2 b with permeability plotted in logarithm the line slope red dash line in fig 2 b yields the values of n k t which leads to the determination of n when k t is known by fitting the normal stress closure data the value n of for different samples are also labeled in the figures figs 2 and 3 show the comparisons of closure and permeability between the measured data and theoretical predictions in the natural and artificial fractures the fitted values of b 0 e b 0 t k e k t k 1 e k 1 t n and the related correlation coefficient of curve fitting r 2 are listed in table 1 the normal stress closure and normal stress flow rate analytical curves based on the tphm are in reasonable agreements with the measurements in the normal stress closure and normal stress permeability figures the comparisons between the hard and soft part closures and permeabilities are also presented it is found that the soft part has a larger closure and permeability than the hard part at low stress and is the main influential factors of the high nonlinearity of mechanical and hydraulic behaviors even though the unstressed aperture of the soft part from 0 0509 to 0 0944 mm is about as large as that of the hard part from 0 0585 to 0 1054 mm for comparison the predictions of the power model k a Ï b from gale 1982 and logarithmic model k k 0 c d ln Ï 2 from swan 1983 are also plotted in the figures where a b c and d are is material constants k 0 is the initial permeability under the unstressed state the power curves are generally higher than the test data and the deviation of the logarithmic model is also quite apparent at high stress range the performances of the power and logarithmic models are much poorer than the proposed normal stress permeability relationship in addition the flaw of these two functions is also obvious in which the power and logarithmic models give zero and infinite permeability values respectively as the normal stress approaches zero with increasing normal stress the curve slope of the soft part closure becomes more gradual and almost remains unchanged at high stress while the hard part closure maintains a linear upward trend note that the fitted values of the soft part modulus k t from 0 8342 to 1 03 mpa are relatively smaller than that of the hard part modulus k e from 14 4377 to 28 7928 mpa which indicates that the nonlinear deformation at low stress is principally contributed by the soft part apertures as a consequence the nonlinear reduction of the permeability at low stress significantly depends on the deformation of the soft part apertures which suggests that the tphm can adequately represent the experimental observations on the normal stress dependence of permeability including the nonlinear relation at low stress state the fitted n value for the artificial fracture is 4 24 lower than that 2 41 for the natural fracture subjected to alteration and mismatching due to mechanical and chemical weathering the curve slope of the artificial fracture is steeper than that of natural fracture which indicates that the permeability changes with the normal stress have obvious sensitivity of fracture geometry 3 2 correlated and uncorrelated fracture experiments in the quartz monzonite in order to investigate the effect of aperture correlation on the normal stress dependence of hydraulic properties in low permeability rock the measured mechanical and hydraulic dataset provided by pyrak nolte et al 1987 are employed to evaluate the proposed relationships between normal stress closure and flow rate to obtain the mechanical displacement and flow rate data at different stresses the hydro mechanical experiments were carried out on the fracture samples e30 and e32 with 52 mm in diameter and 77 mm in height a test machine was used to apply an axial load to the specimen and the effective stress was kept constant the fracture closure was determined by the measured displacement difference between the four precision linear variable differential transformers attached in pairs on diametrically opposed sides of the sample a linear flow technique quadrant flow was applied to measure flow rate with an upstream pressure of 0 4 mpa the fracture void geometry and contact area with various stresses were obtained by a metal injection technique a scanning electron microscope sem and photographic techniques pronounced differences in the structure of shape size and distribution of contact area were observed by pyrak nolte et al 1987 the contact areas of e30 tended to be large and clustered whereas those of e32 were smaller more numerous and elongate namely the aperture distributions of e30 and e32 were spatially correlated and uncorrelated respectively due to that the flow rate under zero effective stress q 0 is not given from pyrak nolte et al 1987 eq 17 can be rewritten as 19 q q 1 e 1 Î´ Ï k e 3 q 1 t exp m Î´ Ï k t where q 1 e is the flow rate of the hard part at the lowest observed normal stress and related to q 0 e by q 1 e q 0 e 1 Ï 1 k e 3 q 1 t is the flow rate of the soft part at Ï 1 and related to q 0 t by q 1 t q 0 t exp m Ï 1 k t the fitting procedure of normal stress dependent flow rate for single fractures is similar to the normal stress dependent permeability in the section 3 1 as shown in fig 4 b k e Ï Î² q Î² q Î± 1 3 Ï Î± 1 q Î² q Î± 1 3 q 1 e q Î± 1 Ï Î± k e 3 and q 1 t q 1 q 1 e can be obtained using eqs 17 and 19 when two data points Ï Î± q Î± and Ï Î² q Î² at high stress are selected then the flow rate of the soft part can be calculated by the difference between the total flow rate and the hard part flow rate and its line slope in logarithm yields the proportionality m k t the value of m is determined when k t is known by fitting the normal stress closure data the comparisons of the normal stress dependent closure and flow rate relationships between the measured and analytical results are presented in figs 4 and 5 which suggests that the theoretical predictions given by the proposed tphm based closure and flow rate functions agree quite well with the experimental observations the fitted values of undetermined parameters are listed in table 1 and r2 are both larger than 0 98 therefore the proposed relationships between normal stress closure and flow rate are verified through hydro mechanical analysis in correlated and uncorrelated fractures e30 and e32 and the tphm is valid to describe the normal stress sensitivity of flow rate in single fractures according to eq 16 the larger the values of m the greater reduction of flow rate in low stress range the curve slope m of the correlated sample e30 6 21 is larger than that of the uncorrelated sample e32 3 50 as shown in the soft part flow rate curves in figs 4 and 5 which indicates that the spatial correlation of fracture geometry plays an important role in determining the parameter m this is because for a spatially correlated fracture the occurrence of the soft part closure subject to the low stress is compact and the few limited dominant flow paths lead to the rapid decrease of flow rate while the closure of the uncorrelated soft part is randomly scattered and multiple connected flow paths can support the relatively gradual change with the low stress which is in accord with the results of pyrak nolte and morris 2000 3 3 natural rough fracture experiments under loading and unloading cycles to further validate the proposed normal stress flow rate relationship in natural fracture experiments with respect to loading and unloading cycles the datasets provided by kulatilake et al 2020 are considered the compression and flow tests were performed in granodiorite and quartz monzonite porphyry samples with natural fractures and subjected to three uniaxial compressive loading and unloading cycles in each loading and unloading cycles the fracture closure was measured by a set of eight lvdts prior to the flow testing at any given normal load level the fracture sample was wax sealed firstly and then water was injected at a constant head through a gas regulator the flow rate was measured by an electronic flow meter under a steady state flow condition each test was repeated at least 3 times the experimental data matched with the proposed relationships between normal stress closure and flow rate are shown in figs 6 8 the parameters for the fitted curves are given in table 1 the analytical curves based on the tphm can satisfactorily represent experimental observations for all loading and unloading cycles and the values of r 2 are both larger than 0 98 likewise the increase of fracture closure and decrease of flow rate in each loading cycle are pronounced at low stress and become more gradual at high stress as the loading cycle number increases the values of b 0 e and b 0 t decrease slightly from 0 1467 to 0 1293 mm and rapidly from 0 3602 to 0 1809 mm corresponding to the small change in q 1 e and large change in q 1 t meanwhile k t increases from 0 7637 to 1 2295 mpa and m decreases slightly from 5 73 to 4 92 with increasing loading cycle number except that the value of k e does not change noticeably which indicates that the soft part has a significant influence on the irrecoverable fracture deformation and flow drop between loading cycles 4 conclusions concerning the normal stress dependent hydraulic behavior of single fractures the tphm is employed to conceptually divide fracture aperture into a hard part and a soft part at a macroscopic scale and then to describe different degree of hydraulic properties of single fractures subject to normal stress where rapid descent at low stress and slow descent at high stress are presented with the consideration of different effect of soft part and hard part apertures on the hydraulic properties associated with the different mechanical properties subject to normal stress analytical relationships between normal stress and fluid flow for single fractures are derived the validity of the proposed relationships has been verified by three kinds of experimental data from literature and good agreements between the theoretical results and the measurement are obtained the soft part is responsible for the significant reduction of permeability at low stress because of the larger closure and permeability than the hard part at low stress state and the degree of permeability and flow reduction with the normal stress has obvious sensitivity of fracture geometry when the fracture aperture is more correlated the closure of the soft part at low stress is more compact which may lead to remarkable reduction of flow cross section and great tortuousity of flow pathways rather than scatter distribution in the uncorrelated soft part during loading cycles the irrecoverable fracture deformation and flow drop are closely related to the soft part while the unstressed fracture aperture flow rate and modulus of the hard part are almost unaffected the focus of this paper is on the development of physically reasonable relationships for normal stress dependent fluid flow based on a simple and intuitive way of thinking at a macro scale however the deformation degrees of each local aperture and asperity are extremely different at a micro scale the permeability change with normal stress is heavily dependent on the spatial variation of aperture distribution and contact area at present it is hard to accurately target the locations of the soft and hard parts and quantitatively determine the effect of fracture geometry on the unknown parameters of the proposed model further experimental and numerical studies are required to relate the micro structure of single fractures to the macro hydro mechanical properties in the future work credit authorship contribution statement zuyang ye investigation conceptualization writing review

3503,pan evaporation epan reflects the evaporation potential of surface water and is a key indicator of atmospheric evaporative demand previous studies have found a substantial decrease in epan across china dominated by declining wind speed and solar radiation before the late 2000 s however how epan responds to the recovery of wind speed and solar radiation since the late 2000 s remains unclear here we investigate the spatial and temporal patterns of epan and analyze its controlling factors based on the daily meteorological observations during 1965 2018 at 2 018 stations over china we find that the annual epan in the northwest and south of china is higher than that in the northeast and central parts of china the national mean epan decreases significantly during 1965 1989 at a rate of 6 57 mm yr 2 then reverses at a rate of 4 58 mm yr 2 distinct seasonal discrepancies and geographical heterogeneities in epan trends are observed declining wind speed mainly contributes to the decrease in epan before 1989 while relative humidity is shown as the dominant factor that drives the growth of epan after the turning point the recovery of wind speed still has significant impact on epan variation in parts of china while epan is only mainly affected by solar radiation in parts of central china in autumn our findings highlight the importance of understanding epan variations and driving factors and call for precautions and adaptation actions to combat and prevent flash droughts over china especially in the south of china keywords pan evaporation atmospheric evaporative demand relative humidity wind speed reversal 1 introduction pan evaporation epan the water evaporation in a filled shallow and flat container is an important indicator of atmospheric evaporative demand mcmahon et al 2013 roderick et al 2009 understanding temporal and spatial variations of epan is crucial for regional water resources management agricultural production and drought monitoring fan et al 2016 otkin et al 2013 yan et al 2019 because of the complex processes involved the variations of epan could be largely influenced by multiple climatic variables classified as the aerodynamic components the effects of air temperature air humidity and wind speed and the radiative components the effects of solar radiation liu and sun 2016 roderick et al 2007 thus the epan trend has been affected significantly by global climate change rotstayn et al 2006 yu et al 2017 the prevailing view is that global warming could increase the atmospheric water holding capacity causing the intensification of the hydrological cycle and the acceleration of the epan rate rind et al 1990 however the worldwide decline in epan under a warming climate during the past 20th century known as the evaporation paradox peterson et al 1995 roderick and farquhar 2004 raises doubts about future changes of epan long term observations revealed a decreasing trend of epan during the second half of the 20th century in many regions around the world wang et al 2017 for example the epan in most parts of china had decreased during 1960 1993 at a rate of 2 6 mm yr 2 i e mm yr 1 per year represents the trend of annual epan then reversed afterward wang et al 2017 to investigate the predominant factors of the evaporation paradox roderick et al 2007 separated epan into radiative and aerodynamic components by using a semi empirical penpan model and quantitatively attributed the change in epan to changes in radiation temperature humidity and wind speed in australia they found that the decrease of epan is mainly caused by decreasing wind speed along with a combined effect of decreasing solar irradiance in some regional areas this pioneering work has led to comprehensive investigations of the climatic attributions of epan trends by employing the penpan model yang and yang 2012 modified the penpan model to fit the epan observations from d20 pan instruments in china and reported that the dominant factors are radiation and wind speed which influenced the epan trend across china during 1961 2001 a detrending approach was developed to analyze the sensitivity of climate factors to the epan trend in a recent study wang et al 2017 the results reveal that the changes in solar radiation relative humidity and wind speed have overcompensated the positive contribution of increasing air temperature to epan resulting in the reduction of epan in china in the context of climate change climatic variables may have different changing patterns during various periods for example solar radiation and wind speed as the dominant factors of epan across china during the 20th century yang and yang 2012 have decreased substantially from the 1960 s to the late 2000 s and then reversed gradually yang et al 2018 zeng et al 2019 however the temperature has continued to rise yue et al 2013 and relative humidity has declined over the past 50 years song et al 2012 how these changing characteristics in climatic variables affect the epan trend is still not clear in addition compared with the widely addressed interannual spatio temporal patterns of epan the seasonality of epan should also be critically assessed especially for dry seasons that are crucial for water resources management and drought risks this study aims to answer two questions 1 how epan changes spatially and temporally and 2 how are the variations of epan controlled by different climatic factors in this study we investigate the spatial variations and temporal trends of epan during 1965 2018 based on the climatic observations at 2 018 stations across mainland china moreover the impacts of different climate factors on epan are analyzed in different climatic zones at annual and seasonal scales the comprehensive understanding of the epan variations in china could have significant implications for the sustainable management of agricultural water resources besides the results could shed insights on the monitoring of flash drought as intensifying atmospheric evaporative demand is a pre warning signal of flash drought nguyen et al 2019 2 material and methodology 2 1 data collection this study focuses on mainland china due to the limitation of in situ observations over the taiwan province hong kong and macao meteorological variables on a daily scale during 1965 2018 are originally derived from the dense ground observations from 2 481 meteorological stations in mainland china fig 1 provided by the geographic data sharing infrastructure in the college of urban and environmental science peking university http geodata pku edu cn since there are only 806 stations that have epan observations we applied an estimation approach to provide pan evaporation values at all available stations see section 2 2 for detail five key variables from the ground observations are used to estimate epan values and to investigate the climatic attributions of epan trends namely the maximum air temperature tmax unit minimum air temperature tmin relative humidity rh at 2 m height wind speed ws m s at 10 m height and global solar radiation rs mj m 2 d 1 the data preprocess for these variables is as follows 1 during the study period a month is treated as valid for a station if it has 15 or more days of records in this month 2 stations are excluded from analysis if they are not valid in more than 4 years for any of the 12 months 3 monthly average data for all valid months is calculated du et al 2020 there are 2 018 meteorological stations with valid observation throughout the period 1965 2018 after data quality controls a few monthly records are missing and are interpolated by using an up to 10 year average for the same month regional variations for the spatio temporal characteristics of epan are investigated over four climatic zones in mainland china fig 1 feng et al 2018 namely the temperate continental zone tcz the temperate monsoon zone tmz the mountain plateau zone mpz and the subtropical monsoon zone smz the meteorological stations are quite dense in eastern china but relatively sparse in the northwest to maintain a high spatial resolution of analyses and ensure full coverage of mainland china we use 1 5 1 5 grid spacing as the basic unit in investigating the epan variations with a total of 391 grid boxes included liu et al 2019 after the aforementioned data preprocessing 375 grid boxes with at least one station are left for those boxes with more than one station the average value is calculated in addition the seasonal variations in spring march to may summer june to august autumn september to november and winter december to february are analyzed 2 2 estimation of pan evaporation due to the lacking of epan observations in about 60 of meteorological stations and the instrument replacement from the d20 micropan to the large e601b pan around the year 2002 for the other 40 stations it s hard to analyze the long term trend of epan by using the ground observations directly in this study the epan model yang and yang 2012 is adopted to generate long term epan which can be estimated as 1 e pan Î´ Î´ a Î³ r n Î» a Î³ Î´ a Î³ f q u d Î» where Î´ is the

observed and the model calculated epan have been compared over 806 stations that have in situ pan evaporation records fig 2 although there s some deviation between the observed and calculated epan the temporal variability of them are highly consistent r 2 94 p 0 001 indicating that the epan model performs well in capturing the characteristics of the observed epan regionally the observed and calculated values only show relatively low consistency in mpz r 2 70 p 0 001 among four climatic zones due to the lack of climate stations moreover the calculated epan is lower than observed in mpz hereafter the model calculated epan from the 2 018 stations refer to as calculated epan is employed in analyses to show the spatio temporal changes and attributions of epan in mainland china 2 3 statistical analysis the piecewise linear regression model is employed in this study due to its ability to determine the trend and turning point tp of meteorological variables zeng et al 2019 this method is applicable when the regression of y to x obeys different linear relationships with various slopes in different periods it uses indicator variables to fit a unified regression model for each segment the regression approaches are executed 300 times with the randomly chosen 40 percent of the stations greater than800 stations each time to minimize the possibility that tp could be caused by certain great changes in epan at a few stations the variable controlling attribution method zeng et al 2018 is employed in this study to investigate the driving factors of epan trends this method stems from the nature of epan which is related to temperature humidity wind speed and radiation equations 1 11 fig 3 a five analysis scenarios are set to explore the impact of each climate variable on epan for each scenario only one of the five climatic variables tmax tmin rh ws and rs is derived from the observation and the others are replaced by their climatological mean values the epan in each scenario is further calculated based on the epan model equation 1 yang and yang 2012 using observed and climatological mean values the calculated epan of each scenario is then regarded as influenced only by the corresponding climatic variable fig 3 shows an example of national mean estimation in the five scenario analyses overall epan is positively correlated to the trend of tmax tmin ws and rs while negatively correlated to the trend of rh by comparing the trends slopes of the calculated epan in each scenario to the calculated epan using observations of all variables during the period before and after the tp the changes in epan could be attributed to the five climatic variables at regional or grid scales 3 results 3 1 regional variation of annual and seasonal epan overall the national multi year average epan is 5 04 mm d 1 during the period 1965 2018 with obvious seasonal variability fig 4 a the highest value occurs in summer 7 97 mm d 1 and the lowest value occurs in winter 2 05 mm d 1 a little higher than the findings in zhang et al 2015 the mean epan during spring and autumn is 6 00 mm d 1 and 3 92 mm d 1 respectively spatially the annual epan shows obvious regional variations with higher values in the tcz and the south of smz while lower values in the northeast and the central part of china fig 4b in spring epan demonstrates a similar spatial pattern to that of the annual epan but with a slightly higher magnitude fig 4c in summer epan is quite high in the tcz and relatively low in the northeast of the tmz and near the border between the mpz and the smz fig 4d in autumn epan is around 4 mm d 1 across mainland china except for a few higher values scattered on parts of the tcz and the southern coastal areas of smz fig 4e in winter the evaporation rates are at a low level over mainland china showing a gradually decreasing pattern from south to north fig 4f 3 2 temporal trends of annual and seasonal epan the piecewise linear regression approach is repeated 300 times in this study shown as the grey lines in fig 5 a generally the piecewise linear fit is statistically significant at p 0 001 with a goodness of fit of r 2 59 about 66 of the regressions show a tp of epan trend in the year 1989 while others are in 1990 fig 5b the annual mean epan decreases significantly p 0 001 at a rate of 6 57 mm yr 2 during the period 1965 1989 fig 5a after 1989 epan shows a significant increase trend at a rate of 4 58 mm yr 2 p 0 001 the declining slopes before the tp among the 300 regressions range from 7 1 to 6 0 mm yr 2 and the rising trends after the tp are between 4 1 mm yr 2 and 5 1 mm yr 2 fig 5c the regional variations are also clearly observed in terms of the long term trends of annual epan and the occurring time of tipping points across mainland china fig 6 approximately 46 of the 371 grid boxes show a decreasing trend during the period 1965 2018 and the other 54 show an increasing trend presenting a highly spatial heterogeneity pattern fig 6a in most parts of the tcz mpz and smz annual epan demonstrates an overall increasing trend and the tps of those grid boxes generally occur later than 1991 while in tmz and the north of smz annual epan shows an overall decrease trend and the tps often occur earlier than 1988 fig 6a b before the tp epan declines in almost all the regions especially in the northwest and central china with the fastest decreasing rate lower than 8 mm yr 2 fig 6c conversely after the tp epan increases in most grid boxes with a rate of more than 4 mm yr 2 fig 6d seasonal characteristics of the spatio temporal variations of epan over mainland china are illustrated in fig 7 in general the time series of national mean epan display reversal patterns in all four seasons with a negative trend before the tp and a positive one after it epan trends in spring and summer are consistent with the annual trend fig 7a d tps in the two seasons occur around the years 1990 and 1993 a little later than that of the annual epan by contrast epan trends in autumn and winter are more fluctuating with the goodness of fits of r 2 17 and 13 respectively fig 7g j the tp of mean epan in autumn is around the year 1982 which is much earlier than those of other seasons besides the slopes of epan display seasonally dependent variations due to the discrepancies of evaporation intensity in different seasons for example in summer epan decreases significantly p 0 001 at a rate of 2 70 mm yr 2 before the tp and then increases at 2 04 mm yr 2 fig 7d while in winter epan declines non significantly with a slope of 0 50 mm yr 2 p greater than 0 05 before 1990 and then reverses to a positive trend of 0 58 mm yr 2 p 0 05 fig 7j spatially decreased trends are observed in most areas in spring and summer before the tps 88 and 84 specifically the epan trends decrease sharply in central china and northwest china at a rate lower than 2 mm yr 2 a value that could be more than two times higher than that in other regions fig 7b e after the tps an increasing trend of epan is observed over most areas except for the northeast of tmz in spring and summer fig 7c f the increasing trend over central china is higher in spring 2 mm yr 2 than that in summer overall the spatial patterns of epan trends in spring and summer are quite similar to those for annual epan fig 6b d those consistencies imply that the interannual spatio temporal patterns of epan over mainland china are mainly dominated by the seasonal characteristics in spring and summer epan trends in the other two seasons present diverse spatial distribution fig 7h k decreasing epan trends are only observed in 74 of areas in autumn before the tps fig 7h moreover a large number of grid boxes in central china do not present the reversal trend after the tps like others fig 7i in other words epan has increased in spring and summer while continuing to decrease in autumn implying that the inner annual variation of epan in central china has amplified after 1985 although the magnitude of the trend in winter is generally lower than that of other seasons the overall reversal of epan trends is observed over most regions except for northeast china and parts of northwest china fig 7k l in the above areas epan generally shows an increasing trend before the tps then turns to decrease 3 3 contribution of climatic variables to the change of epan the contribution of each climate variable on the change of epan across mainland china is investigated by comparing the trend of epan that is only influenced by one climate variable in the scenario analyses with the trend of the calculated epan the slopes of all the epan time series are analyzed over the four climatic zones during the period before and after the tp fig 8 before 1989 tmz experiences the fastest decline rate of the calculated epan 11 28 mm yr 2 which is almost ten times of that in the mpz 1 26 mm yr 2 similar epan decreasing rates around 5 65 mm yr 2 are observed in the tcz and the smz among all the drivers being investigated ws predominates the decline of epan in all four zones during the period 1965 1989 in the smz rs also contributes 37 of the long term epan trend close to the contribution of ws 48 after the tp the reversal in epan is observed in all four regions the increasing rate is highest in the tcz 6 79 mm yr 2 followed by the smz 6 28 mm yr 2 the mpz 4 97 mm yr 2 and the tmz 3 19 mm yr 2 ws and rs have little effect on the change of epan while the other three climatic variables show larger impacts rh plays the most important role in impacting epan in the tmz 74 and the smz 47 tmax and rh share larger contributions to the epan trend in the tcz 37 and 30 and the mpz 51 and 45 than tmin 25 and 37 for the tcz and mpz respectively moreover annual and seasonal patterns of the controlling factors for epan trend are investigated at both national and grid scales fig 9 before the tp ws dominates in wide areas of china for both annual and seasonal variations seasonal discrepancies are found in the smz where the change of epan is mainly attributed to the variation of rs in spring and summer and is affected by ws in autumn and winter fig 9e h k n this regional pattern consists of the analyses in fig 8 demonstrating the important role of spring and summer epan again in influencing the interannual spatio temporal characteristics in the northeast tmz the epan trend is mainly attributed to tmin in summer fig 9h after the tp the spatial distribution of the controlling factors shows a higher level of heterogeneity and has larger differences among seasons in spring and summer tmax and rh share the importance of affecting the epan trend with ws showing distinct regional patterns fig 9f i rh is the dominant driver in southern tmz and the smz tmax controls the epan trend over parts of the tcz while ws mainly predominates in the north of tmz in autumn the distribution of dominant drivers is relatively scattered with rs being the main impacting factor in central china and others interlacing across mainland china fig 9l regions influenced by temperature are reduced substantially in autumn compared to those in spring and summer in winter almost all the country is mainly affected by rh or ws with the low temperature at this time annual trends of the key climatic variables can well explain the changing patterns of the controlling factors for the epan trend fig 3 before the tp ws and rs declined rapidly while the others remained stable consequently the decrease of epan is primarily determined by ws and rs over mainland china while after the tp changes of ws and rs did not appear to be obvious on account of the rising temperature and the decreasing relative humidity there are more areas influenced by tmax and rh with the reduced contributions from ws and rs although the spatial distribution of the main climatic factors affecting epan after the tp varies greatly from season to season rh always plays the dominant role in many regions that is decreasing rh is an important factor leading to the reversal of epan in china very few areas are affected by rs except for some central areas in autumn it should be noted that ws still plays an important role at the grid scale after the tp fig 9c despite it showing little effect on the national mean trends of epan in the scenario analyses fig 3e the weak impact of ws on national epan after tp may be caused by an offset between the opposite effects from the rise and fall of ws over different areas across mainland china 4 discussion the findings of this study generally agree with the results of other research in the temporal and spatial variations of annual epan across mainland china our estimates show that epan decreased first and then reversed to increase during 1965 2018 with the tp appearing in 1989 results that are similar to the conclusions of wang et al 2017 and zhang et al 2015 the decreasing rate before the tp 6 57 mm yr 2 is slightly greater than that reported by zhang et al 5 88 mm yr 2 such a difference may derive from the inconsistent epan estimation method the annual epan reverses at a rate of 4 58 mm yr 2 after the tp generally in line with the estimated value 4 29 mm yr 2 in wang et al 2017 from the spatial perspective wang et al 2017 found a faster decreasing rate of epan before the tp in northwest and central china this regional variation is also illustrated in our findings however the increasing trends over the mpz and the tmz reported by them are not statistically significant in our analyses after the tp the spatial distribution for rapidly increased epan in this study is similar to the pattern of wang et al 2017 but the decreased areas in the northeast in their findings are larger even including parts of central china besides the variable controlling attribution method employed in this study several attribution methods have also been developed to investigate the driving factors of changes in epan for example based on the partial differentiation method yang and yang 2012 found that the change in epan is mainly influenced by ws at 31 of 54 stations over china in a previous study using the detrended data series the dominant impact factor for the epan trend over yangtze river basin during 1960 2000 was considered to be rs followed by ws xu et al 2006 our findings are generally consistent with theirs given the great influence of ws during both two periods though they didn t segment the study period besides a detrending approach was used to quantify the contribution of climate variables to epan wang et al 2017 they found that changes in solar radiation wind speed and relative humidity have considerably offset the positive impacts of increasing temperature on the epan trend especially during the period 1960 1993 in the following period 1994 2013 the strong warming signal lead to the increase of epan across china except for the northeast these shifting characteristics of predominant factors during the period before and after tps are also documented in our analyses we also test whether changing the attribution method alters our results by employing the partial differentiation method and we find that our findings are generally robust not shown furthermore the impacts of different climatic variables on epan are analyzed at different spatial and temporal scales in our analyses offering important insights for better understanding the driving factors of epan trends across mainland china new is that we demonstrate the predominant role of relative humidity in the reversal of epan after 1989 especially in central and south china the recovery of wind speed and the persistent warming still has effects on epan variation but is limited to parts of north china the vast majority of terrestrial freshwater resources come from precipitation and et is the main consumption form of precipitation schlesinger and jasechko 2014 therefore the hydrological study of et has far reaching significance anderson and french 2019 li et al 2018 due to the limited availability of observed et products we cannot analyze the patterns of et directly yet although et can be estimated by the penman monteith equation it is unable to test the reliability of calculated values without observed et as references todorovic et al 2013 epan is close to the maximum et when surface water is sufficient while it becomes a function of atmosphere water demand when the surface is dry thus studies related to the spatial and temporal variations of epan across china could be helpful to water resources management yan et al 2019 the tcz of which most areas are distributed in the arid climatic zone has the fastest growth rate in epan among the four regions therefore it is critical to ensure sufficient agricultural water for the crops in the tcz during the dry seasons water scarcity can lead to serious food crises due to limited precipitation liu et al 2015 especially in spring epan grows rapidly more than 2 mm yr 2 in northwest central and southern china because epan reflects atmospheric evaporative demand its rapid growth indicates a larger water demand for crops with the consequent reduction in crop yield and agricultural productivity mancosu et al 2015 thus the allocation of agricultural water resources in spring should be paid more attention in the future epan as an important indicator in the exchange processes of water and energy between the land and atmosphere and is sensitive to the change of environment could become a signal of some natural disasters such as flash drought flash drought generally refers to rapidly developing drought in the warm season without sufficient early warning under the background of global warming the change of precipitation is insufficient to fully explain the change of drought intensity and range and the increase of et caused by higher temperature becomes an important factor to aggravate drought yuan et al 2020 the definition of flash drought proposed by mo and lettenmaier 2015 focused on the meteorological conditions that trigger a flash drought such as high temperature low precipitation intense et and so on esi defined as the standardized anomaly of the ratio of the actual et to the potential et pet is a popular variable for consideration in drought monitoring nguyen et al 2019 esi is sensitive to precipitation soil moisture plant and land characteristics humidity wind speed air temperature and solar radiation during a flash drought event the esi rapidly decreases initially due to the increased pet epan similar to pet is representative of atmospheric evaporative demand and has a simple observation method so it is suitable to be a pre warning signal of flash drought wang et al 2016 found that flash droughts in china are prone to occur in humid and semi humid areas such as the south and northeast of china and their frequency increases significantly between 1979 and 2010 additionally strong et and epan due to lower humidity and higher temperature have a deep need for more attention our results during the period after the turning point imply that flash drought easily occurs in spring and summer due to the higher epan under the combined impacts of increasing temperature and decreasing relative humidity the relative humidity is the predominant factor in most areas of the smz low air humidity drives water into the air faster from the land as the soil gradually becomes dry et is limited by water and begins to decrease inversely slowing down the drying speed of soil moisture when et changes from energy limited to water limited flash drought is likely to occur koster et al 2019 therefore this is an early warning sign of flash drought occurring in the smz which is consistent with the speculation of yuan et al 2019 hence future efforts to better understand the changing patterns of epan are necessary such gains would be beneficial to take precautions and adapt actions to flash droughts over china especially in the smz 5 conclusions in this study we investigate the spatial and temporal patterns of epan and analyze its controlling factors across mainland china during 1965 2018 based on the observations at 2 018 meteorological stations first the applicability of the epan estimation model is verified the magnitude and trend of the calculated epan are consistent with those of the observed epan annual epan in the northwest and south of china is higher than that in the northeast and central part of china the national mean epan decreases significantly during 1965 1989 at a rate of 6 57 mm yr 2 then reverses at a rate of 4 58 mm yr 2 further regional and seasonal variations in epan trends are observed at the grid scale the interannual patterns of epan over mainland china are mainly dominated by the characteristics before the turning points epan shows a downward trend for the annual variation over most areas in spring and summer especially in central and northwest china after turning points epan increase over china except for the northeast the largest spatio temporal heterogeneity of the epan trend is found in autumn in addition the variable controlling attribution method is employed to analyze the impacts of five key climatic variables tmax tmin rh ws and rs on the epan trend the results show that epan is mainly affected by the decreased wind speed across mainland china before the turning point along with a combined effect of decreasing solar radiation in smz after the turning point decreasing relative humidity as well as increasing maximum air temperature and recovering wind speed share larger contributions to the epan trend notably the decline of rh becomes the dominant driver in the smz and the maximum air temperature mainly contributing to the change of epan in the tcz during spring and summer in recent years due to the huge influence on the hydrological cycle in these two seasons the attribution of variation epan should be focused on to prevent and adapt the drought risks credit authorship contribution statement yubin jin formal analysis visualization writing original draft dashan

3503,pan evaporation epan reflects the evaporation potential of surface water and is a key indicator of atmospheric evaporative demand previous studies have found a substantial decrease in epan across china dominated by declining wind speed and solar radiation before the late 2000 s however how epan responds to the recovery of wind speed and solar radiation since the late 2000 s remains unclear here we investigate the spatial and temporal patterns of epan and analyze its controlling factors based on the daily meteorological observations during 1965 2018 at 2 018 stations over china we find that the annual epan in the northwest and south of china is higher than that in the northeast and central parts of china the national mean epan decreases significantly during 1965 1989 at a rate of 6 57 mm yr 2 then reverses at a rate of 4 58 mm yr 2 distinct seasonal discrepancies and geographical heterogeneities in epan trends are observed declining wind speed mainly contributes to the decrease in epan before 1989 while relative humidity is shown as the dominant factor that drives the growth of epan after the turning point the recovery of wind speed still has significant impact on epan variation in parts of china while epan is only mainly affected by solar radiation in parts of central china in autumn our findings highlight the importance of understanding epan variations and driving factors and call for precautions and adaptation actions to combat and prevent flash droughts over china especially in the south of china keywords pan evaporation atmospheric evaporative demand relative humidity wind speed reversal 1 introduction pan evaporation epan the water evaporation in a filled shallow and flat container is an important indicator of atmospheric evaporative demand mcmahon et al 2013 roderick et al 2009 understanding temporal and spatial variations of epan is crucial for regional water resources management agricultural production and drought monitoring fan et al 2016 otkin et al 2013 yan et al 2019 because of the complex processes involved the variations of epan could be largely influenced by multiple climatic variables classified as the aerodynamic components the effects of air temperature air humidity and wind speed and the radiative components the effects of solar radiation liu and sun 2016 roderick et al 2007 thus the epan trend has been affected significantly by global climate change rotstayn et al 2006 yu et al 2017 the prevailing view is that global warming could increase the atmospheric water holding capacity causing the intensification of the hydrological cycle and the acceleration of the epan rate rind et al 1990 however the worldwide decline in epan under a warming climate during the past 20th century known as the evaporation paradox peterson et al 1995 roderick and farquhar 2004 raises doubts about future changes of epan long term observations revealed a decreasing trend of epan during the second half of the 20th century in many regions around the world wang et al 2017 for example the epan in most parts of china had decreased during 1960 1993 at a rate of 2 6 mm yr 2 i e mm yr 1 per year represents the trend of annual epan then reversed afterward wang et al 2017 to investigate the predominant factors of the evaporation paradox roderick et al 2007 separated epan into radiative and aerodynamic components by using a semi empirical penpan model and quantitatively attributed the change in epan to changes in radiation temperature humidity and wind speed in australia they found that the decrease of epan is mainly caused by decreasing wind speed along with a combined effect of decreasing solar irradiance in some regional areas this pioneering work has led to comprehensive investigations of the climatic attributions of epan trends by employing the penpan model yang and yang 2012 modified the penpan model to fit the epan observations from d20 pan instruments in china and reported that the dominant factors are radiation and wind speed which influenced the epan trend across china during 1961 2001 a detrending approach was developed to analyze the sensitivity of climate factors to the epan trend in a recent study wang et al 2017 the results reveal that the changes in solar radiation relative humidity and wind speed have overcompensated the positive contribution of increasing air temperature to epan resulting in the reduction of epan in china in the context of climate change climatic variables may have different changing patterns during various periods for example solar radiation and wind speed as the dominant factors of epan across china during the 20th century yang and yang 2012 have decreased substantially from the 1960 s to the late 2000 s and then reversed gradually yang et al 2018 zeng et al 2019 however the temperature has continued to rise yue et al 2013 and relative humidity has declined over the past 50 years song et al 2012 how these changing characteristics in climatic variables affect the epan trend is still not clear in addition compared with the widely addressed interannual spatio temporal patterns of epan the seasonality of epan should also be critically assessed especially for dry seasons that are crucial for water resources management and drought risks this study aims to answer two questions 1 how epan changes spatially and temporally and 2 how are the variations of epan controlled by different climatic factors in this study we investigate the spatial variations and temporal trends of epan during 1965 2018 based on the climatic observations at 2 018 stations across mainland china moreover the impacts of different climate factors on epan are analyzed in different climatic zones at annual and seasonal scales the comprehensive understanding of the epan variations in china could have significant implications for the sustainable management of agricultural water resources besides the results could shed insights on the monitoring of flash drought as intensifying atmospheric evaporative demand is a pre warning signal of flash drought nguyen et al 2019 2 material and methodology 2 1 data collection this study focuses on mainland china due to the limitation of in situ observations over the taiwan province hong kong and macao meteorological variables on a daily scale during 1965 2018 are originally derived from the dense ground observations from 2 481 meteorological stations in mainland china fig 1 provided by the geographic data sharing infrastructure in the college of urban and environmental science peking university http geodata pku edu cn since there are only 806 stations that have epan observations we applied an estimation approach to provide pan evaporation values at all available stations see section 2 2 for detail five key variables from the ground observations are used to estimate epan values and to investigate the climatic attributions of epan trends namely the maximum air temperature tmax unit minimum air temperature tmin relative humidity rh at 2 m height wind speed ws m s at 10 m height and global solar radiation rs mj m 2 d 1 the data preprocess for these variables is as follows 1 during the study period a month is treated as valid for a station if it has 15 or more days of records in this month 2 stations are excluded from analysis if they are not valid in more than 4 years for any of the 12 months 3 monthly average data for all valid months is calculated du et al 2020 there are 2 018 meteorological stations with valid observation throughout the period 1965 2018 after data quality controls a few monthly records are missing and are interpolated by using an up to 10 year average for the same month regional variations for the spatio temporal characteristics of epan are investigated over four climatic zones in mainland china fig 1 feng et al 2018 namely the temperate continental zone tcz the temperate monsoon zone tmz the mountain plateau zone mpz and the subtropical monsoon zone smz the meteorological stations are quite dense in eastern china but relatively sparse in the northwest to maintain a high spatial resolution of analyses and ensure full coverage of mainland china we use 1 5 1 5 grid spacing as the basic unit in investigating the epan variations with a total of 391 grid boxes included liu et al 2019 after the aforementioned data preprocessing 375 grid boxes with at least one station are left for those boxes with more than one station the average value is calculated in addition the seasonal variations in spring march to may summer june to august autumn september to november and winter december to february are analyzed 2 2 estimation of pan evaporation due to the lacking of epan observations in about 60 of meteorological stations and the instrument replacement from the d20 micropan to the large e601b pan around the year 2002 for the other 40 stations it s hard to analyze the long term trend of epan by using the ground observations directly in this study the epan model yang and yang 2012 is adopted to generate long term epan which can be estimated as 1 e pan Î´ Î´ a Î³ r n Î» a Î³ Î´ a Î³ f q u d Î» where Î´ is the

observed and the model calculated epan have been compared over 806 stations that have in situ pan evaporation records fig 2 although there s some deviation between the observed and calculated epan the temporal variability of them are highly consistent r 2 94 p 0 001 indicating that the epan model performs well in capturing the characteristics of the observed epan regionally the observed and calculated values only show relatively low consistency in mpz r 2 70 p 0 001 among four climatic zones due to the lack of climate stations moreover the calculated epan is lower than observed in mpz hereafter the model calculated epan from the 2 018 stations refer to as calculated epan is employed in analyses to show the spatio temporal changes and attributions of epan in mainland china 2 3 statistical analysis the piecewise linear regression model is employed in this study due to its ability to determine the trend and turning point tp of meteorological variables zeng et al 2019 this method is applicable when the regression of y to x obeys different linear relationships with various slopes in different periods it uses indicator variables to fit a unified regression model for each segment the regression approaches are executed 300 times with the randomly chosen 40 percent of the stations greater than800 stations each time to minimize the possibility that tp could be caused by certain great changes in epan at a few stations the variable controlling attribution method zeng et al 2018 is employed in this study to investigate the driving factors of epan trends this method stems from the nature of epan which is related to temperature humidity wind speed and radiation equations 1 11 fig 3 a five analysis scenarios are set to explore the impact of each climate variable on epan for each scenario only one of the five climatic variables tmax tmin rh ws and rs is derived from the observation and the others are replaced by their climatological mean values the epan in each scenario is further calculated based on the epan model equation 1 yang and yang 2012 using observed and climatological mean values the calculated epan of each scenario is then regarded as influenced only by the corresponding climatic variable fig 3 shows an example of national mean estimation in the five scenario analyses overall epan is positively correlated to the trend of tmax tmin ws and rs while negatively correlated to the trend of rh by comparing the trends slopes of the calculated epan in each scenario to the calculated epan using observations of all variables during the period before and after the tp the changes in epan could be attributed to the five climatic variables at regional or grid scales 3 results 3 1 regional variation of annual and seasonal epan overall the national multi year average epan is 5 04 mm d 1 during the period 1965 2018 with obvious seasonal variability fig 4 a the highest value occurs in summer 7 97 mm d 1 and the lowest value occurs in winter 2 05 mm d 1 a little higher than the findings in zhang et al 2015 the mean epan during spring and autumn is 6 00 mm d 1 and 3 92 mm d 1 respectively spatially the annual epan shows obvious regional variations with higher values in the tcz and the south of smz while lower values in the northeast and the central part of china fig 4b in spring epan demonstrates a similar spatial pattern to that of the annual epan but with a slightly higher magnitude fig 4c in summer epan is quite high in the tcz and relatively low in the northeast of the tmz and near the border between the mpz and the smz fig 4d in autumn epan is around 4 mm d 1 across mainland china except for a few higher values scattered on parts of the tcz and the southern coastal areas of smz fig 4e in winter the evaporation rates are at a low level over mainland china showing a gradually decreasing pattern from south to north fig 4f 3 2 temporal trends of annual and seasonal epan the piecewise linear regression approach is repeated 300 times in this study shown as the grey lines in fig 5 a generally the piecewise linear fit is statistically significant at p 0 001 with a goodness of fit of r 2 59 about 66 of the regressions show a tp of epan trend in the year 1989 while others are in 1990 fig 5b the annual mean epan decreases significantly p 0 001 at a rate of 6 57 mm yr 2 during the period 1965 1989 fig 5a after 1989 epan shows a significant increase trend at a rate of 4 58 mm yr 2 p 0 001 the declining slopes before the tp among the 300 regressions range from 7 1 to 6 0 mm yr 2 and the rising trends after the tp are between 4 1 mm yr 2 and 5 1 mm yr 2 fig 5c the regional variations are also clearly observed in terms of the long term trends of annual epan and the occurring time of tipping points across mainland china fig 6 approximately 46 of the 371 grid boxes show a decreasing trend during the period 1965 2018 and the other 54 show an increasing trend presenting a highly spatial heterogeneity pattern fig 6a in most parts of the tcz mpz and smz annual epan demonstrates an overall increasing trend and the tps of those grid boxes generally occur later than 1991 while in tmz and the north of smz annual epan shows an overall decrease trend and the tps often occur earlier than 1988 fig 6a b before the tp epan declines in almost all the regions especially in the northwest and central china with the fastest decreasing rate lower than 8 mm yr 2 fig 6c conversely after the tp epan increases in most grid boxes with a rate of more than 4 mm yr 2 fig 6d seasonal characteristics of the spatio temporal variations of epan over mainland china are illustrated in fig 7 in general the time series of national mean epan display reversal patterns in all four seasons with a negative trend before the tp and a positive one after it epan trends in spring and summer are consistent with the annual trend fig 7a d tps in the two seasons occur around the years 1990 and 1993 a little later than that of the annual epan by contrast epan trends in autumn and winter are more fluctuating with the goodness of fits of r 2 17 and 13 respectively fig 7g j the tp of mean epan in autumn is around the year 1982 which is much earlier than those of other seasons besides the slopes of epan display seasonally dependent variations due to the discrepancies of evaporation intensity in different seasons for example in summer epan decreases significantly p 0 001 at a rate of 2 70 mm yr 2 before the tp and then increases at 2 04 mm yr 2 fig 7d while in winter epan declines non significantly with a slope of 0 50 mm yr 2 p greater than 0 05 before 1990 and then reverses to a positive trend of 0 58 mm yr 2 p 0 05 fig 7j spatially decreased trends are observed in most areas in spring and summer before the tps 88 and 84 specifically the epan trends decrease sharply in central china and northwest china at a rate lower than 2 mm yr 2 a value that could be more than two times higher than that in other regions fig 7b e after the tps an increasing trend of epan is observed over most areas except for the northeast of tmz in spring and summer fig 7c f the increasing trend over central china is higher in spring 2 mm yr 2 than that in summer overall the spatial patterns of epan trends in spring and summer are quite similar to those for annual epan fig 6b d those consistencies imply that the interannual spatio temporal patterns of epan over mainland china are mainly dominated by the seasonal characteristics in spring and summer epan trends in the other two seasons present diverse spatial distribution fig 7h k decreasing epan trends are only observed in 74 of areas in autumn before the tps fig 7h moreover a large number of grid boxes in central china do not present the reversal trend after the tps like others fig 7i in other words epan has increased in spring and summer while continuing to decrease in autumn implying that the inner annual variation of epan in central china has amplified after 1985 although the magnitude of the trend in winter is generally lower than that of other seasons the overall reversal of epan trends is observed over most regions except for northeast china and parts of northwest china fig 7k l in the above areas epan generally shows an increasing trend before the tps then turns to decrease 3 3 contribution of climatic variables to the change of epan the contribution of each climate variable on the change of epan across mainland china is investigated by comparing the trend of epan that is only influenced by one climate variable in the scenario analyses with the trend of the calculated epan the slopes of all the epan time series are analyzed over the four climatic zones during the period before and after the tp fig 8 before 1989 tmz experiences the fastest decline rate of the calculated epan 11 28 mm yr 2 which is almost ten times of that in the mpz 1 26 mm yr 2 similar epan decreasing rates around 5 65 mm yr 2 are observed in the tcz and the smz among all the drivers being investigated ws predominates the decline of epan in all four zones during the period 1965 1989 in the smz rs also contributes 37 of the long term epan trend close to the contribution of ws 48 after the tp the reversal in epan is observed in all four regions the increasing rate is highest in the tcz 6 79 mm yr 2 followed by the smz 6 28 mm yr 2 the mpz 4 97 mm yr 2 and the tmz 3 19 mm yr 2 ws and rs have little effect on the change of epan while the other three climatic variables show larger impacts rh plays the most important role in impacting epan in the tmz 74 and the smz 47 tmax and rh share larger contributions to the epan trend in the tcz 37 and 30 and the mpz 51 and 45 than tmin 25 and 37 for the tcz and mpz respectively moreover annual and seasonal patterns of the controlling factors for epan trend are investigated at both national and grid scales fig 9 before the tp ws dominates in wide areas of china for both annual and seasonal variations seasonal discrepancies are found in the smz where the change of epan is mainly attributed to the variation of rs in spring and summer and is affected by ws in autumn and winter fig 9e h k n this regional pattern consists of the analyses in fig 8 demonstrating the important role of spring and summer epan again in influencing the interannual spatio temporal characteristics in the northeast tmz the epan trend is mainly attributed to tmin in summer fig 9h after the tp the spatial distribution of the controlling factors shows a higher level of heterogeneity and has larger differences among seasons in spring and summer tmax and rh share the importance of affecting the epan trend with ws showing distinct regional patterns fig 9f i rh is the dominant driver in southern tmz and the smz tmax controls the epan trend over parts of the tcz while ws mainly predominates in the north of tmz in autumn the distribution of dominant drivers is relatively scattered with rs being the main impacting factor in central china and others interlacing across mainland china fig 9l regions influenced by temperature are reduced substantially in autumn compared to those in spring and summer in winter almost all the country is mainly affected by rh or ws with the low temperature at this time annual trends of the key climatic variables can well explain the changing patterns of the controlling factors for the epan trend fig 3 before the tp ws and rs declined rapidly while the others remained stable consequently the decrease of epan is primarily determined by ws and rs over mainland china while after the tp changes of ws and rs did not appear to be obvious on account of the rising temperature and the decreasing relative humidity there are more areas influenced by tmax and rh with the reduced contributions from ws and rs although the spatial distribution of the main climatic factors affecting epan after the tp varies greatly from season to season rh always plays the dominant role in many regions that is decreasing rh is an important factor leading to the reversal of epan in china very few areas are affected by rs except for some central areas in autumn it should be noted that ws still plays an important role at the grid scale after the tp fig 9c despite it showing little effect on the national mean trends of epan in the scenario analyses fig 3e the weak impact of ws on national epan after tp may be caused by an offset between the opposite effects from the rise and fall of ws over different areas across mainland china 4 discussion the findings of this study generally agree with the results of other research in the temporal and spatial variations of annual epan across mainland china our estimates show that epan decreased first and then reversed to increase during 1965 2018 with the tp appearing in 1989 results that are similar to the conclusions of wang et al 2017 and zhang et al 2015 the decreasing rate before the tp 6 57 mm yr 2 is slightly greater than that reported by zhang et al 5 88 mm yr 2 such a difference may derive from the inconsistent epan estimation method the annual epan reverses at a rate of 4 58 mm yr 2 after the tp generally in line with the estimated value 4 29 mm yr 2 in wang et al 2017 from the spatial perspective wang et al 2017 found a faster decreasing rate of epan before the tp in northwest and central china this regional variation is also illustrated in our findings however the increasing trends over the mpz and the tmz reported by them are not statistically significant in our analyses after the tp the spatial distribution for rapidly increased epan in this study is similar to the pattern of wang et al 2017 but the decreased areas in the northeast in their findings are larger even including parts of central china besides the variable controlling attribution method employed in this study several attribution methods have also been developed to investigate the driving factors of changes in epan for example based on the partial differentiation method yang and yang 2012 found that the change in epan is mainly influenced by ws at 31 of 54 stations over china in a previous study using the detrended data series the dominant impact factor for the epan trend over yangtze river basin during 1960 2000 was considered to be rs followed by ws xu et al 2006 our findings are generally consistent with theirs given the great influence of ws during both two periods though they didn t segment the study period besides a detrending approach was used to quantify the contribution of climate variables to epan wang et al 2017 they found that changes in solar radiation wind speed and relative humidity have considerably offset the positive impacts of increasing temperature on the epan trend especially during the period 1960 1993 in the following period 1994 2013 the strong warming signal lead to the increase of epan across china except for the northeast these shifting characteristics of predominant factors during the period before and after tps are also documented in our analyses we also test whether changing the attribution method alters our results by employing the partial differentiation method and we find that our findings are generally robust not shown furthermore the impacts of different climatic variables on epan are analyzed at different spatial and temporal scales in our analyses offering important insights for better understanding the driving factors of epan trends across mainland china new is that we demonstrate the predominant role of relative humidity in the reversal of epan after 1989 especially in central and south china the recovery of wind speed and the persistent warming still has effects on epan variation but is limited to parts of north china the vast majority of terrestrial freshwater resources come from precipitation and et is the main consumption form of precipitation schlesinger and jasechko 2014 therefore the hydrological study of et has far reaching significance anderson and french 2019 li et al 2018 due to the limited availability of observed et products we cannot analyze the patterns of et directly yet although et can be estimated by the penman monteith equation it is unable to test the reliability of calculated values without observed et as references todorovic et al 2013 epan is close to the maximum et when surface water is sufficient while it becomes a function of atmosphere water demand when the surface is dry thus studies related to the spatial and temporal variations of epan across china could be helpful to water resources management yan et al 2019 the tcz of which most areas are distributed in the arid climatic zone has the fastest growth rate in epan among the four regions therefore it is critical to ensure sufficient agricultural water for the crops in the tcz during the dry seasons water scarcity can lead to serious food crises due to limited precipitation liu et al 2015 especially in spring epan grows rapidly more than 2 mm yr 2 in northwest central and southern china because epan reflects atmospheric evaporative demand its rapid growth indicates a larger water demand for crops with the consequent reduction in crop yield and agricultural productivity mancosu et al 2015 thus the allocation of agricultural water resources in spring should be paid more attention in the future epan as an important indicator in the exchange processes of water and energy between the land and atmosphere and is sensitive to the change of environment could become a signal of some natural disasters such as flash drought flash drought generally refers to rapidly developing drought in the warm season without sufficient early warning under the background of global warming the change of precipitation is insufficient to fully explain the change of drought intensity and range and the increase of et caused by higher temperature becomes an important factor to aggravate drought yuan et al 2020 the definition of flash drought proposed by mo and lettenmaier 2015 focused on the meteorological conditions that trigger a flash drought such as high temperature low precipitation intense et and so on esi defined as the standardized anomaly of the ratio of the actual et to the potential et pet is a popular variable for consideration in drought monitoring nguyen et al 2019 esi is sensitive to precipitation soil moisture plant and land characteristics humidity wind speed air temperature and solar radiation during a flash drought event the esi rapidly decreases initially due to the increased pet epan similar to pet is representative of atmospheric evaporative demand and has a simple observation method so it is suitable to be a pre warning signal of flash drought wang et al 2016 found that flash droughts in china are prone to occur in humid and semi humid areas such as the south and northeast of china and their frequency increases significantly between 1979 and 2010 additionally strong et and epan due to lower humidity and higher temperature have a deep need for more attention our results during the period after the turning point imply that flash drought easily occurs in spring and summer due to the higher epan under the combined impacts of increasing temperature and decreasing relative humidity the relative humidity is the predominant factor in most areas of the smz low air humidity drives water into the air faster from the land as the soil gradually becomes dry et is limited by water and begins to decrease inversely slowing down the drying speed of soil moisture when et changes from energy limited to water limited flash drought is likely to occur koster et al 2019 therefore this is an early warning sign of flash drought occurring in the smz which is consistent with the speculation of yuan et al 2019 hence future efforts to better understand the changing patterns of epan are necessary such gains would be beneficial to take precautions and adapt actions to flash droughts over china especially in the smz 5 conclusions in this study we investigate the spatial and temporal patterns of epan and analyze its controlling factors across mainland china during 1965 2018 based on the observations at 2 018 meteorological stations first the applicability of the epan estimation model is verified the magnitude and trend of the calculated epan are consistent with those of the observed epan annual epan in the northwest and south of china is higher than that in the northeast and central part of china the national mean epan decreases significantly during 1965 1989 at a rate of 6 57 mm yr 2 then reverses at a rate of 4 58 mm yr 2 further regional and seasonal variations in epan trends are observed at the grid scale the interannual patterns of epan over mainland china are mainly dominated by the characteristics before the turning points epan shows a downward trend for the annual variation over most areas in spring and summer especially in central and northwest china after turning points epan increase over china except for the northeast the largest spatio temporal heterogeneity of the epan trend is found in autumn in addition the variable controlling attribution method is employed to analyze the impacts of five key climatic variables tmax tmin rh ws and rs on the epan trend the results show that epan is mainly affected by the decreased wind speed across mainland china before the turning point along with a combined effect of decreasing solar radiation in smz after the turning point decreasing relative humidity as well as increasing maximum air temperature and recovering wind speed share larger contributions to the epan trend notably the decline of rh becomes the dominant driver in the smz and the maximum air temperature mainly contributing to the change of epan in the tcz during spring and summer in recent years due to the huge influence on the hydrological cycle in these two seasons the attribution of variation epan should be focused on to prevent and adapt the drought risks credit authorship contribution statement yubin jin formal analysis visualization writing original draft dashan

3504,groundwater contaminant sources identification and parameter estimation using the simulation optimization s o approach require numerous runs of the computationally expensive simulation model through the optimization algorithm the computational cost can be effectively reduced by using a surrogate model which can accurately approximate the simulation model with the advent of deep learning long short term memory lstm networks which are suitable to learn sequential data are being increasingly applied to regression problems involving time dependencies however for the simultaneous contaminant source identification and parameter estimation problem the surrogate model requires to establish a relationship between release histories at the source locations to concentration measurements at observation points subject to given values of aquifer parameters in this study a novel deep neural network framework entity aware sequence to sequence learning using long short term memory eas lstm is proposed as a surrogate model which takes both sequential i e release histories at the source locations at different stress periods and static variables i e transport parameters as inputs to predict breakthrough curves btcs at observation points the proposed surrogate model is applied to a heterogeneous field scale aquifer with 4 zones the mean squared error mse using eas lstm is 0 0033 ppm2 which is significantly better than that of kriging and support vector regression svr which are 0 048 ppm2 and 1 302 ppm2 respectively comparison of eas lstm model performance with kriging and svr based models demonstrates its higher accuracy further the optimization algorithms for inverse modelling the performances of multiverse optimizer mvo grey wolf optimization gwo and particle swarm optimization pso are investigated it is observed that the combination of eas lstm and mvo provides better results in comparison to other surrogate simulation optimization sso models keywords contaminant source identification parameter estimation groundwater contamination surrogate model long short term memory lstm multiverse optimization mvo 1 introduction groundwater resources are susceptible to contamination through various natural and anthropogenic sources batu 2005 once polluted it is essential to reduce the contamination levels to a desirable level by considering the stakeholders involved through different remediation processes nevertheless the aquifer remediation techniques are expensive and therefore they require accurate information about contamination sources such as location and release history sun et al 2006 when contamination is first detected in the aquifer the information about sources such as location and release history is unknown this information about the sources is very crucial to predict the movement of the contaminant plume which can be used to identify the affected aquifer and predict future contamination areas which are essential for proper management of the water resources further in many contamination occurrences the hydrogeological parameters such as hydraulic conductivity dispersivity effective porosity etc are unidentified which increases the intricacy of the problem wagner 1992 moreover the concentration measurements at observation locations are also subjected to uncertainty due to instrumental or human errors yeh et al 2007 mathematically source identification and aquifer parameter estimation are inverse problems amongst various approaches the simulation optimization s o approach is widely applied to solve this problem aral et al 2001 yeh et al 2007 ayvaz 2010 gurarslan and karahan 2015 this approach has also been used for the estimation of parameters and source identification wagner 1992 mahar and datta 2000 in this approach the optimization technique employs a simulation model to evaluate several combinations of release rates at possible source locations and aquifer parameters to produce agreeable concentrations at observation points nonetheless this approach is computationally expensive as the simulation model which solves the complex boundary value problem of groundwater flow and transport is summoned numerous times by the optimization algorithm li et al 2020 alternatively these simulation models can be replaced with surrogate models which are trained using datasets prepared from the former a well trained surrogate model can efficiently approximate the simulation models and reduce the computational complexity surrogate models such as feed forward neural networks ffnn majumder and eldho 2020 singh and datta 2004 extreme machine learning li et al 2020 yadav et al 2016 and kriging zhao et al 2016 have been successfully implemented for simulating complex hydrological and hydrogeological environment although these methods have been proven effective these techniques are not inherently designed for learning the data in the form of multiple sequences therefore the analyzing capability of the temporal dependencies between the sequential input and output data is restricted in these models recurrent neural network rnn which is a type of deep neural network dnn is specifically designed for learning these dependencies between input and output long short term memory lstm is a variant of rnn which was proposed by hochreiter and schmidhuber 1997 to overcome the exploding and vanishing gradient problem in simplistic or vanilla rnns in lstm the input data is transformed into an internal state sequentially which is later deciphered to return output in a sequential form it has been successfully used in many applications in water resources such as streamflow prediction gao et al 2020 water table depth forecasting zhang et al 2018 water quality modelling liang et al 2020 and flood forecasting lv et al 2020 however these types of lstm models are suitable where input and output sequences are of the same length for problems where the lengths of input and output sequences are different a lately developed strategy i e encoder decoder lstm ed lstm is applied sutskever et al 2014 kao et al 2020 in this sequence to sequence seq2seq learning approach the input sequence is initially encoded into internal states using an lstm which is later decoded using another lstm the present study aims to develop a dnn based surrogate model which maps release rates at possible source locations and transport parameters to breakthrough curves btcs at the observation points here release rates and btcs are input and output sequences respectively in contrast transport parameters are static and specific to the study area therefore the current study can be deemed as entity aware seq2seq learning as lstms necessitates both input and output data to be in sequential form a new type of lstm i e entity aware lstm ealstm was proposed by kratzert et al 2019 to handle both static and dynamic sequential data as input our study proposes ealstm to be used as an encoder in the seq2seq learning it transforms the release rates at possible source locations and transport parameters into an encoded state subsequently a decoder lstm is used to derive the output sequence from the encoded state in a recursive manner the proposed model is named entity aware sequence to sequence learning using long short term memory eas lstm the training data set is prepared using inputs from meshfree radial point collocation method rpcm simulation model which is advantageous compared to standard grid mesh based methods such as finite difference method fdm and finite element method fem in terms of simplicity of the model ease of domain discretization handling high advection and reaction rates for contaminant transport problems etc liu and gu 2005 singh et al 2016 anshuman et al 2019 anshuman and eldho 2020 also the use of a meshfree method facilitates the addition deletion of nodes without altering the node structure for the entire domain which is helpful in adaptive analysis pathania et al 2020 rpcm model has been successfully used for groundwater problems such as flow simulation meenal and eldho 2011 contaminant transport simulation anshuman et al 2019 and coupled flow transport simulation guneshwor et al 2018 anshuman and eldho 2020 in inverse modelling using the s o approach the optimization model also plays a significant role some of the popular optimization algorithms in groundwater related problems are genetic algorithm particle swarm optimization pso cat swarm optimization grey wolf optimization gwo and differential evolution de singh and datta 2006 thomas et al 2018 guneshwor et al 2018 majumder and eldho 2020 these algorithms try to achieve an optimal solution through a search process that can be broadly divided into exploration and exploitation phases in the exploration phase an optimization algorithm looks for promising regions of optimum solution in the global search domain while in the latter it tries to converge to global optimum around the obtained promising regions a recently proposed multiverse optimization mvo algorithm ensures a balance between exploration and exploitation phase by proving smooth transition from former to latter mirjalili et al 2016 in this study mvo is used as an optimization tool for the identification of contamination sources and transport parameters through eas lstm surrogate model simulations for a case study the performance of the proposed surrogate model is compared with that of widely used kriging and support vector regression svr based surrogate models moreover the performance of mvo is studied against that of gwo and pso algorithms 2 methodology 2 1 groundwater flow and transport simulation the steady state flow in a heterogeneous and anisotropic

successfully used for groundwater modelling meenal and eldho 2011 guneshwor et al 2018 anshuman et al 2019 anshuman and eldho 2020 in rpcm the problem domain is decomposed into several overlapping support domains which surround each node see fig 1 a variable h at location xi can be approximated using n nodes in its support domain as shown in eq 9 liu and gu 2005 9 h x i k 1 n f r k x i x k a k here f r k stands for multi quadrics radial basis function mq rbf evaluated for k th node in the local support domain which is given by kansa 1990a 1990b 10 f r x i x k x x k 2 Î± d c 2 q the term x x k represents the euclidean distance between node xi and the point of interest xk and dc is the average nodal distance considering all internal nodes the mq rbf shape parameters are denoted by q and Î± the unknown coefficients a k in eq 9 can be estimated by enforcing the mq rbf moment matrix to pass through the nodes in the local support domain as follows liu and gu 2005 11 a k 1 f r x 1 x 1 f r x 1 x k f r x k x 1 f r x k x k 1 h k 1 g 1 h k 1 where h is the approximated solution of the variable of h by substituting eq 11 in eq 9 the solution for h can be obtained as follows liu and gu 2005 12 h x i f r g 1 h Ï h the term Ï is referred to as shape function which is estimated for each node within its local support domain the derivatives of the shape functions concerning directions can be estimated by swapping the mq rbf vector f r in eq 12 with the corresponding derivative terms hence the rpcm solutions to the governing equation 1 can be represented in terms of the shape functions and their derivatives in eq 13 it should be noted that as the concerning pde is nonlinear with respect to h it is solved iteratively meenal and eldho 2011 13 Ï x i Îº x i h Ï x i Îº x i Ï x i h Ï x i

and eldho 2020 a detailed study on sensitivity analysis for the parameter Î¸ is given in anshuman and eldho 2020 2 2 a brief overview of lstm artificial neural networks ann such as feed forward neural networks ffnn has been used in the past due to their simplicity and high accuracy majumder and eldho 2020 singh and datta 2004 however in ffnn the time dependency in the input data is not learnt sequentially as the training data is flattened and the sequential temporal information is lost conversely in recurrent neural networks rnn the information is allowed to be carried over different time steps which are beneficial for learning the sequential dependency in the input data making it more suitable even for long time series kao et al 2020 neural networks are generally trained using the back propagation technique using gradient descent algorithms nevertheless rnns suffer from vanishing and exploding gradients issues increasingly with the time steps which aggravates the model training process this issue can be effectively dealt with by using long short term memory lstm hochreiter and schmidhuber 1997 which is a special type of rnn it uses a combination of three gates namely input forget and output see fig 2 a these gates operate on the given input i and hidden state h at time step t using sigmoid activation function Ï as shown in eqs 15 17 15 f t Ï w 1 f i t w 2 f h t 1 b f 16 i t Ï w 1 i i t w 2 i h t 1 b i 17 o t Ï w 1 o i t w 2 o h t 1 b o here ft it and ot are sigmoid activation vectors obtained from forget input and output gates respectively the respective terms w1 and w2 are weights associated with input and hidden state whereas b represents the bias vector the subscripts f i and o correspond to forget input and output gates respectively the cell state ct is computed using antecedent cell state vector c t which is a function of input at time t and hidden state vector of the previous time step eq 18 and 19 similarly hidden state ht is computed using ot and cell state ct eq 20 the notation refers to hadamard or the dot product between concerning vectors 18 c t t a n h w 1 c i t w 2 c h t 1 b c 19 c t f t c t 1 i t c t 20 h t o t t a n h c t 2 3 entity aware lstm and sequence to sequence learning as discussed in the introduction section the objective of the study is to develop a dnn which learns the relationship between the contaminant release history at source locations and observed concentrations at observation points subject to certain values of transport parameters the release history and contaminant observation data are sequential or dynamic on the other hand the transport parameters such as dispersivity Î±l and effective porosity Î· e are dependent on the soil type and are static as lstm requires both input and output data in sequential form a modified version of lstm i e entity aware long short term memory ealstm which can take both static and sequential variables as input is proposed for this study kratzert et al 2019 in ealstm the conventional lstm is modified by introducing the static variables in the input gate see fig 2b mathematically the gate operations in lstm i e eqs 15 20 are modified as follows kratzert et al 2019 21 f t Ï w 1 f i d t w 2 f h t 1 b f 22 i Ï w 1 i i st b i 23 o t Ï w 1 o i d t w 2 o h t 1 b o 24 c t t a n h w 1 c i d t w 2 c h t 1 b c 25 c t f t c t 1 i c t 26 h t o t t a n h c t here i d and i st are dynamic sequential and static inputs respectively note that the f and o gates are computed at every timestep using i d while the input gate i is evaluated only once using i st as shown in fig 2 in both lstm and ealstm each memory unit outputs a hidden state h t and cell state ct at each timestep the number of neurons used in the hidden states is generally higher than that of the input sequence zhang et al 2018 gao et al 2020 a fully connected layer is further used to transform these states to output zhang et al 2018 however this approach is not suitable when the lengths of input and output sequences are unequal as in the current study kao et al 2020 hence a sequence to sequence seq2seq learning strategy is employed which uses an encoder decoder technique to map the input sequence to output sequence kao et al 2020 xiang et al 2020 in this framework the input data is sequentially fed into the encoder in this study ealstm is proposed as the encoder as shown in fig 2 ealstm encodes the input into hidden and cell states are at each timestep the encoded hidden and cell states after the last timestep are set as initial states for the decoder lstm which generates the output hidden sequences recursively using a fully connected layer these hidden sequences are transformed into the output sequence this dnn architecture can accommodate input and output sequences of different lengths which is suitable for source identification problems as the stress periods of contaminant releases and measurements in observation wells can be of unequal lengths further for the current study the dnn is required to learn the input and output sequences for a given set of transport parameters i e zonal dispersivities and porosities which are static variables the proposed encoder decoder model for the study is named entity aware sequence to sequence learning using long short term memory eas lstm the architecture of the model is provided in fig 3 as observed the encoder takes both static and dynamic sequential variables the input gate i e eq 22 is evaluated only once and re used by ealstm at every timestep to evaluate corresponding hidden and cell states here it may be noted that a proxy input for the first timestep is provided at the decoder lstm for the first timestep the proxy input consists of a zero matrix as the input dataset used to train the eas lstm model are mutually exclusive hence decoder lstm is forced to learn the first timestep using encoded states from encoder ealstm only in the present study the dynamic sequential component of the input data i e release rates from source locations are arranged in matrix form as n sp n source where n sp and n source stand for the number of stress periods and source locations respectively on the other hand the static component i e zonal transport parameters are arranged in a vector form n t 1 where n t is the number of transport parameters similar to sequential input data the output data is arranged in n t n obs where n t and n obs are the number of timesteps and observation points respectively the model setup is presented in simplified form in fig 4 2 4 kriging kriging is a geostatistical approach in which the interpolated values are estimated by a gaussian process based on prior covariances matheron 1963 it has been applied in groundwater problems such as contaminant source identification zhao et al 2016 monitoring of groundwater monitoring network dhar and datta 2009 and prediction of groundwater depth nikroo et al 2010 the predicted output y is estimated by a linear combination of weighted deterministic function f x and realization of a stochastic process Î¾ x as follows 27 y i 1 k Î² i f i x Î¾ x here the mean of the realization Î¾ x is zero its covariance is estimated as follows 28 c o v z x i z x j Ï 2 r i j 1 n here Ï 2 r and n are process variance gaussian correlation function and the number of data points more details on the kriging method are provided in zhao et al 2016 in the present study the release rates and transport parameters are provided as the input vector similarly the btcs at observation wells are also obtained in the form of a vector 2 5 support vector regression support vector regression svr is a variant of support vector machine svm that tries to fit the input data to a hyperplane with some acceptable error svr has been used for contaminant source identification xing et al 2019 pan et al 2021 and groundwater potential mapping panahi et al 2020 in svr the model prediction y for input x is represented as follows 29 y Ï t Ï x Îµ where Ï is the coefficient vector Ï is the kernel function and Îµ is the bias in this study a commonly used radial basis function rbf kernel is applied al fugara et al 2020 the unknowns Ï and Îµ are estimated by solving the constrained minimization problem given by 30 minimize 1 2 Ï 2 c i 1 n Î¾ i such that 31 y i Ï i x i Îµ Î¾ i Î¾ i 0 i z 1 i n here Ï is the l2 norm of the coefficient matrix c is the regularization parameter and Î¾ is the relaxation parameter the term z and n represent integer and number of data points respectively the optimization problem can be solved using lagrange multipliers as given in xing et al 2019 the input and output data for the svr surrogate model are arranged in a similar way as explained in the previous section 2 6 optimization algorithms 2 6 1 multiverse optimization algorithm multi verse optimization mvo is a recently proposed stochastic population based optimizer mirjalili et al 2016 according to a popular theory in physics there exists a multiverse consisting of innumerable universes each created by a big bang tegmark 2004 in this algorithm the candidate solutions are referred to as universes these universes intermingle by exchanging components using white holes black holes and wormholes the black holes are observed throughout the universe and are known to devour anything close enough due to their immense gravitational force in contrast white holes eject matter into space and are theorized to be created due to a collision between universes eardley 1974 the wormholes are theorized as cosmic tunnels connecting different parts of space time even the multiverse morris and thorne 1988 in mvo it is assumed that only one of the universes i e the best universe contains a white hole while the others contain black holes mirjalili et al 2016 the objects are sent from the universe having a white hole to other universes through white hole black hole tunnels established by the roulette wheel mechanism mirjalili et al 2016 32 x i j x k j if r 1 n i i x i j otherwise here x i j is jth variable and n i i is the normalised inflation rate for of ith universe respectively and x k j denotes jth variable of kth universe selected through roulette wheel mechanism the term r 1 is the random number in 0 1 each universe is assigned an inflation rate that is proportional to the fitness value the best solution after each iteration is considered to the universe with the best inflation expansion rate in mvo the interaction between universes follows the following principles mirjalili et al 2016 1 a higher inflation rate denotes a higher probability of having a white hole 2 a higher inflation rate denotes a lower probability of having a black hole 3 the objects are sent through a white hole from the universe having a higher inflation rate 4 the objects are received through black holes through the universes having lower inflation rates 5 the objects from all universes may move towards the best universe through the wormholes irrespective of the inflation rates from the above rules it is established that the exploration of the search space is done using white holes black holes while the exploitation or local search is done using wormholes every universe can possess a wormhole the local changes in the universes through wormholes is accomplished by eq 33 mirjalili et al 2016 33 x i j x best j t d r u b j l b j r 4 l b j i f r 3 0 5 x best j t d r u b j l b j r 4 l b j o t h e r w i s e if r 2 w e p x i j otherwise where x best j is the jth variable of the best universe u b j and l b j are upper bounds and lower bounds of the jth variable and r 2 r 3 and r 4 are random numbers in 0 1 the terms wep and tdr represent wormhole existence probability and travelling distance rate respectively which are explained in eq 34 and 35 mirjalili et al 2016 34 we p t wep min t wep max w e p min t max 35 tdr 1 t t max 1 n here t and t max are the iteration number and maximum iteration number respectively it is observed that the wep increases linearly with the iteration number within the limits wep min wep max from eq 34 it is observed that the wormhole is only opened if r 2 w e p since wep increases linearly with the iteration number the chances of local search or exploitation increase and global search or exploration decreases with an increase in iteration number this essentially means that the mvo algorithm smoothly transforms from the dominance of the exploration phase to that of the exploitation phase in this study wep max and wep min are fixed as 1 and 0 2 respectively the exponent 1 n in eq 35 introduces non linearity to tdr with respect to iteration number in this study the value of n is fixed as 6 which is suggested by mirjalili et al 2016 higher values of n result in more accurate exploitation sayed et al 2019 the steps involved in mvo is presented in fig 5 2 6 2 grey wolf optimization gwo is an optimization algorithm inspired by the hunting behaviour of grey wolves mirjalili et al 2014 based on leadership and dominance the wolves are categorized into alpha beta delta and omega the first three categories lead the pack for hunting while omega wolves hound the prey alpha is the most dominant category followed by beta and delta mathematically the encircling of prey by the grey wolf pack is denoted as follows 36 d c x w t x i t 37 x i t 1 x w t a d the candidate solution is represented by the position of wolves in the pack i e x t where t denotes the iteration number x w t represents the position of the leading wolf alpha beta or delta a and c are the coefficients based on uniformly distributed random numbers further details of the gwo algorithm can be found in mirjalili et al 2014 and majumder and eldho 2020 2 6 3 particle swarm optimization pso is another stochastic population based algorithm that mimics the movement of a bird flock kennedy and eberhart 1995 here the position of each particle represents a candidate solution all particles possess some velocity which is updated in each iteration using which they traverse the search space the particle velocities are updated at the end of each iteration as follows 38 v i t 1 Ï v i t c 1 r 1 p best x i t c 2 r 2 g best x i t here Ï is the inertia coefficient and c 1 and c 2 are acceleration coefficients the terms r 1 and r 2 are the random numbers in the interval 0 1 the term p best and g best denote best positions of the particle and swarm respectively the positions of particles are updated after each iteration by 39 x i t 1 x i t v i t 3 problem statement and modelling framework 3 1 study area and numerical simulation the study area considered here is a hypothetical heterogeneous irregular unconfined aquifer which is a modified version of majumder and eldho 2017 see fig 6 two rivers are flowing towards the north along the east and west boundaries which enforce the dirichlet boundary condition the head values vary linearly along the river boundaries at the southernmost location the head values are 760 m and 720 m for east and west boundaries respectively the head value at the confluence located at the north is 710 m the southern boundary is impervious or no flux boundary a recharge of 6 5 10 3 m d enters the aquifer through a recharge zone as shown in fig 6 the flow in the aquifer is assumed to be in steady state the total aquifer area of 29 13 km2 is divided into four distinct zones of different hydrogeological parameters see fig 6 the hydraulic conductivities of these zones are presented in table 1 the hydraulic conductivity decreases from east to west direction with an exception of zone 3 which has low hydraulic conductivity of Îº 2 m d the transport parameters i e longitudinal dispersivity and porosity values of these zones are presented in table 1 the transverse dispersity of a zone of the aquifer is assumed as 0 3 times the longitudinal dispersity of the concerned zone it may be noted that these values of the aquifer parameters are suitably assumed from existing literature ayvaz 2010 li et al 2020 2021 in this study we assume three potential contamination sources s1 s2 and s3 located in the aquifer see fig 6 which inject tritium into the aquifer for 4 years in 4 stress periods each spanning 1 year the contaminant considered tritium is reactive half life 12 32 years or Î» 0 000153 d 1 hence the total number of unknowns is 20 3 possible source locations 4 stress periods 8 transport parameters the concentrations are measured at seven observation points located at ob1 ob2 ob3 ob4 ob5 ob6 and ob7 see fig 6 for the synthetic case study numerically simulated concentrations are assumed as observed concentrations the rpcm model is developed for the problem with 1585 nodes with a uniform nodal distance dc of 131 m in x and y directions as discussed the shape functions are required to discretize the governing equations concerning the flow and transport process these shape functions are estimated with mq rbfs with shape parameters q Î± and local support domain size of 0 98 5 and 3 dc respectively these parameters are adopted from the previous studies anshuman et al 2019 anshuman and eldho 2020 singh et al 2016 which provide detailed parameter sensitivity analysis further rpcm simulations are also compared with widely used modflow harbaugh 2005 and mt3dms zheng and wang 1999 in this study the simulated head values are shown in fig 7 and table 2 it is observed that the rpcm simulations match closely with that of modflow at the observation points with a maximum percentage difference of 0 19 considering the travel time required for contaminants to reach the observation points the rpcm model is simulated for 15 years for the release rates given in table 3 it may be noted that these rates are required to be estimated along with transport parameters in table 2 finer time step size increases the model stability at expense of computational time considering this the time step size of 10 days is selected for simulation the movement of contamination plumes in the aquifer throughout the simulation period are presented in fig 8 the rpcm and mt3dms simulated breakthrough curves btc at the observation points are presented in fig 9 the error indicators mean absolute error mae ppm root mean squared error rmse ppm and normalized rmse are computed for the btc obtained at observation locations see table 4 the normalization is done with respect to the maximum concentration obtained by the mt3dms model at the observation wells at some locations the rpcm simulated btcs are observed to rise earlier later compared to that of mt3dms as shown in fig 9 such minor differences are generally observed when two different numerical models are compared especially in the case of a heterogeneous aquifer with irregular boundaries pathania et al 2019 anshuman and eldho 2020 apart from that rpcm model simulations match very well with the results of mt3dms with maximum values of mae rmse and normalized rmse being 1 098 ppm 1 421 ppm and 0 152 respectively the computational time required for the simulation is 34 39 s using an intel i7 10th gen system having 16 gb ram and 2 2 ghz which is aimed to be reduced using the eas lstm surrogate model 3 2 objective function as mentioned in section 3 1 the release rates at the possible source locations and transport parameters i e longitudinal dispersity and porosity are required to be estimated for this inverse modelling problem the error between simulated and observed concentrations at the observation points for contamination release history is minimized the mathematical formulation of the objective function is given by guneshwor et al 2018 40 min 1 n obs i 1 n obs j 1 n t c nor m ij obs c nor m ij sim 2 41 s u b j e c t t o q l q n q u n 1 3 Î± l l Î± l n Î± l u n 1 4 Î· e l Î· e n Î· e u n 1 4 c sim f q Î± l Î· e where c norm obs and c norm sim are normalized observed concentrations and surrogate model simulated concentrations at the observation points respectively the terms n obs and n t represent the number of observation wells and the number of observed timesteps respectively the normalized concentrations at the observation points c norm sim is a function of contamination strength q at n source locations and aquifer parameters Î± l and Î· e at n zones as shown in eq 41 the superscripts l and u in the constraint terms i e eq 41 denote the lower and upper bounds of the variables used in this study which are also presented in table 5 3 2 1 erroneous concentrations it is evident from the objective function i e eq 40 that the performance of the model significantly depends on the accuracy of the observed concentration data at the observation wells however in practice the measurement of the observed concentrations at the observation wells is susceptible to human and instrumental errors yeh et al 2007 considering this the robustness of the proposed model is analyzed using perturbed observation data by using a random normal deviate given by 42 c obs c obs 1 n 0 Ï here n 0 Ï denotes the random normal deviate of mean 0 and standard deviation Ï in this study Ï is taken as 0 1 the function randn from numpy oliphant 2006 is used for generating random numbers the observed concentration in the objective function in eq 40 is replaced with perturbed observed concentrations c obs the mean deviations from the c obs is 0 016 ppm 3 3 sensitivity analysis in sso the optimization model searches for unknowns i e contaminant release histories and transport parameters by minimizing the objective function explained in eq 40 which depends on the difference between the simulated and observed btcs at the observation points here the impact of the unknown variables on this difference is investigated each variable is changed by 50 to 50 of its actual value keeping the other variables unchanged as denoted in tables 1 and 3 with increments of 10 for each analysis the variables other than the concerned variable are fixed as in tables 1 and 3 the mean difference in normalized observed and simulated concentrations for the altered variable is plotted in fig 10 to give equal weightage to all observation points the observed and simulated btcs are normalized it is observed that the mean difference is most sensitive to the porosity of zone 1 and zone 3 the porosity of the medium affects the velocity and the occurrence of peak concentration as seen in fig 8 the contaminant released from s2 located in zone 1 impacts 4 out of a total of 7 observation points in the aquifer the high sensitivity of the mean difference to the porosity values corresponding to these zones is explained by the presence of these observation points in zone 1 and zone 3 similarly the mean difference is more sensitive to the dispersivity values of these zones compared to other zones 3 4 surrogate simulation optimization the steps involved in the development of surrogate simulation optimization model are given as follows 1 data pre processing the input data for eas lstm training comprises dynamic or sequential data i e contamination strengths at source locations and static data i e transport parameters Î±l and Î·e for each set of input data rpcm model simulated btcs at the observation points are used as output uniform random sampling is used to generate input data for the given sample size and corresponding simulated concentrations are estimated by rpcm these data are normalized between respective maximum and minimum values to facilitate the training of the surrogate model in this study a total of 2500 samples are generated out of which 2000 samplesare used for model training and the accuracy of the trained model is tested on 500 samples it may be noted that the neural network during the training process is blind to the samples used for the testing the time required for the generation of the sample is 2 86 h the sequential and static input data are arranged in n sample n sp n s and n sample n t forms respectively here n sample n sp n s and n t denote numbers of samples stress periods potential sources and transport parameters respectively similarly the output data is arranged in n sample n t n o here n t and n o represent numbers of time steps in btcs and observation points respectively it is to be noted that the prior knowledge of the groundwater flow system and btcs at the observation points assists in determining the potential sources of the contamination 2 eas lstm model architecture eas lstm model is developed in pytorch paszke et al 2019 the input data is fed into the encoder ealstm and encoded into hidden states ct and ht for decoder lstm a zero matrix of shape n s 1 n o is provided as teacher forcing for the first timestep the encoded states from encoder ealstm i e ct and ht are set as initial states for decoder lstm for the subsequent timesteps the output from the previous lstm cell is provided as input the output from the decoder lstm is set as input to a dense layer with linear activation 3 training the eas lstm model is trained using the adaptive moment estimation adam algorithm kingma and ba 2014 the trainable model parameters weights and biases are optimized using the gradient descent technique by minimizing the mean squared difference between the training data and predicted data the model is trained for 2500 epochs using a batch size of 200 the trainable model parameters i e weights and biases in eq 21 24 are saved at the end of each epoch where the testing mse betters its previous value the model parameters corresponding to the least values of testing mse are used for prediction 4 evaluation once the eas lstm model is trained it can be used for prediction the sequential and static input data for the trained model is required to be in the same format as step 1 the encoder ealstm converts the input data into an encoded state which is further decoded by the decoder lstm for computation of output sequence as described in step 2 the decoder lstm necessitates a zero tensor as teacher forcing for the first timestep the model performance is evaluated for the training and testing dataset 5 optimization a sso model is developed using eas lstm mvo and the objective function the mvo algorithm is utilized to estimate the unknown variables i e contamination release rates and transport parameters by minimizing the objective function described in eq 40 which uses eas lstm model simulations the population for the variables is initiated within the upper and lower bounds it is to be noted that the inputs to the eas lstm model are required to be normalized using max min normalization as shown in eqs 43 45 43 q norm i q i min q max q min q 44 t norm i t i min t max t min t 45 c norm i c i min c max c min c here q and t imply the dynamic sequential and static input variables respectively c denotes the output variable it is to be noted that the maximum and minimum values of q t and c are computed for the entire sample size the predictions of eas lstm which are normalized values are scaled up to provide the required output sequence these predictions are used for computing the objective function which is to be minimized iteratively the best solution is updated at each iteration the methodology used for solving the source identification and parameter estimation problem using eas lstm and mvo is presented in fig 11 3 5 performance evaluation the performance of an sso model depends on the accuracy of the surrogate model to approximate the simulation model and the ability of the optimization algorithm to find the global optimum the following error metrics are used to evaluate the performance of the sso model 46 r 2 1 i 1 n obs j 1 n t c ij obs c ij sim 2 i 1 n obs j 1 n t c ij obs c ij sim 2 47 rmss i 1 n source j 1 n t q ij act q ij pred 2 n source 48 rmst i 1 n t t i act t i pred 2 n t 49 rmso i 1 n obs j 1 n t c ij obs c ij sim 2 n obs here q and t denote the contamination strengths at the source locations and transport parameters respectively the superscripts act and pred correspond to actual and predicted values respectively the terms n source n t n obs n sp and n t denote the number of potential source locations transport parameters observation well stress periods and timesteps respectively in this study the performance of eas lstm is compared with that of kriging and svr the mvo gwo and pso are used as optimization algorithms the accuracy of the sso models is signified by the proximity of r2 to 1 and low values of rmss rmst and rmso 4 model applications 4 1 predictive accuracy of surrogate models the surrogate models eas lstm kriging and svr are used for the prediction of btcs at the observation wells for given contaminant release histories at source locations and transport parameters a trained surrogate model must approximate the simulation model accurately to be effectively used in combination with optimization to estimate unknown variables the training and testing data set used for all the three surrogate models are the same as presented in section 3 4 to test the generalization capability of the surrogate models the k fold cross validation technique refaeilzadeh et al 2009 is used where the value of k is set to 5 the mean convergence curve of the eas lstm model using different folds sets of training samples is presented in fig 12 the minimum value of mean squared error mse obtained for the training is 1 7 10 6 ppm2 the mean values of different error indicators i e mae ppm rmse ppm and r2 for training and testing datasets are compared in fig 13 for all surrogate models it is observed that the proposed eas lstm model provides lower values of mae and rmse and a higher value of r2 in comparison to kriging and svr models it may be noted that the standard deviation values obtained by the eas lstm models using different combinations of training and testing data are low as shown in fig 13 the btcs at different observation wells simulated by the surrogate models for the current study are presented in fig 14 using the input variables in table 1 and table 3 the eas lstm model is observed to reconstruct the actual btcs more accurately compared to kriging and svr the corresponding mse and r2 values are presented in table 6 which shows that the eas lstm model predictions are most accurate it may be noted that the mse and r2 are computed using concatenated btcs the time required per simulation in eas lstm is 0 031 s which is higher than that of kriging however it is 1066 5 times faster than the simulation model which takes 33 06 s the training of eas lstm is done in nvidia geforce 1660 ti gpu the training time is significantly higher than that of kriging and svr models which is generally the case in lstms based deep neural networks li et al 2021 4 2 inverse modelling results 4 2 1 scenario 1 in this inverse modelling problem the release histories at source locations and zonal transport parameters are required to be estimated using the btcs at the observation points for the current scenario no error in the contaminant measurement is assumed i e model simulated concentrations at the observation points see fig 9 are used for the formulation of the objective function in eq 40 the simulations from the surrogate models i e eas lstm kriging and svr which drastically reduce the computational time are used as c sim and used in the objective function the unknowns are estimated by three optimization models mvo gwo and pso using population size and maximum iteration number of 100 and 3000 respectively which indicates that the surrogate models are called 300 000 times by the optimization algorithms the upper and lower bounds of the unknowns are set as per table 5 the evolution of objective function with iteration number for the sso models is presented in fig 15 as seen in table 7 the minimum value of the objective function obtained is least for eas lstm and mvo compared to its counterparts the 20 estimated unknown variables are presented in fig 16 the eas lstm mvo model is observed to give accurate results compared to other counterparts the error metrics rmss and rmst obtained are the least for eas lstm mvo as seen in table 8 which denotes that the release histories and transport parameters are accurately estimated further the low value of rmso indicates that the eas lstm can reconstruct the btcs at the observation points more precisely using mvo estimated variables similarly the performance of mvo and gwo are similar and are better than that of pso using kriging nonetheless the reconstructed btcs using kriging and svr are not as accurate as eas lstm see fig 14 and table 8 resulting in an imprecise estimation of the unknowns 4 2 2 scenario 2 given the vulnerability of the observed concentrations to human and instrumental errors perturbed observed concentrations c obs as mentioned in section 3 2 1 are used in the objective function in eq 40 these concentrations at different observation points are presented in fig 17 the sso models discussed in section 4 2 1 for all noise levels are run to estimate the unknowns the population size and number of iterations are the same as described in section 4 2 1 for all optimization models the results obtained are presented in fig 18 and table 9 it is observed that the eas lstm mvo model provides low values of rmst and rmso however the rmss and rmso values obtained by eas lstm gwo is lower compared to eas lstm mvo interestingly kriging mvo and kriging gwo models give slightly better results than that of the eas lstm mvo model in terms of r2 which denotes better estimation of unknowns however as per the mathematical formulation of the objective function the eas lstm mvo converged to a lesser value as observed in table 10 on the contrary the error metrics concerning the svr surrogate model denotes its poor performance to obtain the unknowns the reason can be attributed to the low accuracy of the trained svr surrogate model to reconstruct the unperturbed btcs at observation wells as observed in section 4 1 5 discussion the current study proposes a novel dnn named eas lstm for the estimation of contaminant release histories at potential sources and zonal transport parameters in the aquifer for given observed contamination data the dnn uses an ealstm kratzert et al 2019 for taking sequential and static components of the input and transforming them into an encoded state the timestep wise outputs are generated by a decoder lstm recursively the developed model is applied to a heterogeneous aquifer with 4 distinct zones having known hydraulic conductivities it is required to estimate the release intensities of tritium from 3 prospective source locations and zonal transport parameters i e longitudinal dispersivity and effective porosities for observed concentrations at 7 observation points scattered throughout the aquifer the data required for the training of the eas lstm is generated using the meshfree rpcm model the mae rmse and r2 values obtained using k fold cross validation indicate that the eas lstm performs better compared to kriging and svr consequently the eas lstm model reproduces the btcs at 7 observation wells compared to the other two surrogate models the training time requirement of eas lstm is much higher than that of kriging and svr which is expected as lstms are more computationally intensive however the prediction time is only 0 031 s which is 1066 5 times lower than the simulation model i e 33 06 s this drastic reduction in computational time allows for higher population size and iteration numbers in inverse modelling for inverse modelling three stochastic population based optimization algorithms having unique search space exploration strategies i e mvo gwo and pso were utilized using surrogate model simulations the pso implements the movement of the bird flock by updating the position of the candidate solutions based on the best positions of the individual candidates and overall swarm population as shown in eqs 38 and 39 the gwo implements the hunting behaviour of the grey wolves and the position of candidate solutions are updated by encircling the prey principle as per eqs 36 and 37 in contrast to pso and gwo the mvo algorithm changes the candidate solutions through two steps it is accomplished through roulette wheel selection and local exploitation using wep and tdr parameters see eqs 32 35 the roulette wheel selection is accomplished at each iteration to facilitate the exchange of information between the best and other candidate solutions the wep parameter ensures that the mvo algorithm makes a smooth transition from the dominance of the exploration phase to the exploitation phase with an increase in the number of iterations the sso models are applied to two scenarios in the first scenario the btcs at the observation points are considered error free while in the second a random noise is added deliberately to the evaluation of sso model performances it is observed that the combination eas lstm and mvo provides better results in comparison to other surrogate models in estimating the unknown release rates and transport parameters moreover the btcs obtained eas lstm mvo estimated variables also closely match with observed concentrations yielding less value of rmso in scenario 2 the performances of kriging gwo and kriging pso models are better in terms of r2 nonetheless the minimum value obtained by eas lstm mvo is lower than that of the aforementioned sso models which denote that the minimization of the objective function is handled better by mvo some previous studies have also indicated the superiority of the mvo against gwo and pso benmessahel et al 2018 kumar et al 2019 considering the time required for sample generation 2 86 h training 0 62 h and optimization 2 6 h the computational time required for the eas lstm mvo model is 6 08 h on the other hand if the optimization model is embedded with the simulation model the computational time required would approximately be 2755 h for the same population size and iteration number in the optimization algorithm moreover once the eas lstm model is trained it can be used repetitively for different analyses which means that the cost required for optimization will only be considered although the proposed sso framework has demonstrated significant advantages compared to other sso models discussed in the study it is noteworthy that the time required for training is more in eas lstm and it requires graphical processing units gpu as training is prohibitively expensive for a large sample size and hidden neurons without gpus furthermore in the current study the lengths of the input and output sequences are unequal and the output sequence 55 steps is over 13 times lengthier compared to the input sequence 4 steps for simpler problems having shorter sequence lengths shallow machine learning algorithms may be more suitable wunsch et al 2021 6 conclusions the source identification and parameter estimation are conventionally done using the s o approach however as s o models are computationally expensive a modelling framework using a surrogate model named eas lstm is proposed in this study which uses ealstm as an encoder and lstm as a decoder the performance comparison with kriging and svr models suggests that the proposed surrogate model can approximate the simulation model more accurately although the time required for training is higher in the case of the eas lstm model amongst the sso models developed for estimation of unknowns the combination of eas lstm and mvo was found to be more effective to estimate the unknown variables i e release rates at source locations and transport parameters compared to other sso models moreover the eas lstm is over 1000 times faster than the simulation model owing to the accuracy and computational efficiency of the surrogate model the eas lstm model can be efficiently used for source identification and parameter estimation of large scale field problems credit authorship contribution statement aatish anshuman

3504,groundwater contaminant sources identification and parameter estimation using the simulation optimization s o approach require numerous runs of the computationally expensive simulation model through the optimization algorithm the computational cost can be effectively reduced by using a surrogate model which can accurately approximate the simulation model with the advent of deep learning long short term memory lstm networks which are suitable to learn sequential data are being increasingly applied to regression problems involving time dependencies however for the simultaneous contaminant source identification and parameter estimation problem the surrogate model requires to establish a relationship between release histories at the source locations to concentration

memory eas lstm is proposed as a surrogate model which takes both sequential i e release histories at the source locations at different stress periods and static variables i e transport parameters as inputs to predict breakthrough curves btcs at observation points the proposed surrogate model is applied to a heterogeneous field scale aquifer with 4 zones the mean squared error mse using eas lstm is 0 0033 ppm2 which is significantly better than that of kriging and support vector regression svr which are 0 048 ppm2 and 1 302 ppm2 respectively comparison of eas lstm model performance with kriging and svr based models demonstrates its higher accuracy further the optimization algorithms for inverse modelling the performances of multiverse optimizer mvo grey wolf optimization gwo and particle swarm optimization pso are investigated it is observed that the combination of eas lstm and mvo provides better results in comparison to other surrogate simulation optimization sso models keywords contaminant source identification parameter estimation groundwater contamination surrogate model long short term memory lstm multiverse optimization mvo 1 introduction groundwater resources are susceptible to contamination through various natural and anthropogenic sources batu 2005 once polluted it is essential to reduce the contamination levels to a desirable level by considering the stakeholders involved through different remediation processes nevertheless the aquifer remediation techniques are expensive and therefore they require accurate information about contamination sources such as location and release history sun et al 2006 when contamination is first detected in the aquifer the information about sources such as location and release history is unknown this information about the sources is very crucial to predict the movement of the contaminant plume which can be used to identify the affected aquifer and predict future contamination areas which are essential for proper management of the water resources further in many contamination occurrences the hydrogeological parameters such as hydraulic conductivity dispersivity effective porosity etc are unidentified which increases the intricacy of the problem wagner 1992 moreover the concentration measurements at observation locations are also subjected to uncertainty due to instrumental or human errors yeh et al 2007 mathematically source identification and aquifer parameter estimation are inverse problems amongst various approaches the simulation optimization s o approach is widely applied to solve this problem aral et al 2001 yeh et al 2007 ayvaz 2010 gurarslan and karahan 2015 this approach has also been used for the estimation of parameters and source identification wagner 1992 mahar and datta 2000 in this approach the optimization technique employs a simulation model to evaluate several combinations of release rates at possible source locations and aquifer parameters to produce agreeable concentrations at observation points nonetheless this approach is computationally expensive as the simulation model which solves the complex boundary value problem of groundwater flow and transport is summoned numerous times by the optimization algorithm li et al 2020 alternatively these simulation models can be replaced with surrogate models which are trained using datasets prepared from the former a well trained surrogate model can efficiently approximate the simulation models and reduce the computational complexity surrogate models such as feed forward neural networks ffnn majumder and eldho 2020 singh and datta 2004 extreme machine learning li et al 2020 yadav et al 2016 and kriging zhao et al 2016 have been successfully implemented for simulating complex hydrological and hydrogeological environment although these methods have been proven effective these techniques are not inherently designed for learning the data in the form of multiple sequences therefore the analyzing capability of the temporal dependencies between the sequential input and output data is restricted in these models recurrent neural network rnn which is a type of deep neural network dnn is specifically designed for learning these dependencies between input and output long short term memory lstm is a variant of rnn which was proposed by hochreiter and schmidhuber 1997 to overcome the exploding and vanishing gradient problem in simplistic or vanilla rnns in lstm the input data is transformed into an internal state sequentially which is later deciphered to return output in a sequential form it has been successfully used in many applications in water resources such as streamflow prediction gao et al 2020 water table depth forecasting zhang et al 2018 water quality modelling liang et al 2020 and flood forecasting lv et al 2020 however these types of lstm models are suitable where input and output sequences are of the same length for problems where the lengths of input and output sequences are different a lately developed strategy i e encoder decoder lstm ed lstm is applied sutskever et al 2014 kao et al 2020 in this sequence to sequence seq2seq learning approach the input sequence is initially encoded into internal states using an lstm which is later decoded using another lstm the present study aims to develop a dnn based surrogate model which maps release rates at possible source locations and transport parameters to breakthrough curves btcs at the observation points here release rates and btcs are input and output sequences respectively in contrast transport parameters are static and specific to the study area therefore the current study can be deemed as entity aware seq2seq learning as lstms necessitates both input and output data to be in sequential form a new type of lstm i e entity aware lstm ealstm was proposed by kratzert et al 2019 to handle both static and dynamic sequential data as input our study proposes ealstm to be used as an encoder in the seq2seq learning it transforms the release rates at possible source locations and transport parameters into an encoded state subsequently a decoder lstm is used to derive the output sequence from the encoded state in a recursive manner the proposed model is named entity aware sequence to sequence learning using long short term memory eas lstm the training data set is prepared using inputs from meshfree radial point collocation method rpcm simulation model which is advantageous compared to standard grid mesh based methods such as finite difference method fdm and finite element method fem in terms of simplicity of the model ease of domain discretization handling high advection and reaction rates for contaminant transport problems etc liu and gu 2005 singh et al 2016 anshuman et al 2019 anshuman and eldho 2020 also the use of a meshfree method facilitates the addition deletion of nodes without altering the node structure for the entire domain which is helpful in adaptive analysis pathania et al 2020 rpcm model has been successfully used for groundwater problems such as flow simulation meenal and eldho 2011 contaminant transport simulation anshuman et al 2019 and coupled flow transport simulation guneshwor et al 2018 anshuman and eldho 2020 in inverse modelling using the s o approach the optimization model also plays a significant role some of the popular optimization algorithms in groundwater related problems are genetic algorithm particle swarm optimization pso cat swarm optimization grey wolf optimization gwo and differential evolution de singh and datta 2006 thomas et al 2018 guneshwor et al 2018 majumder and eldho 2020 these algorithms try to achieve an optimal solution through a search process that can be broadly divided into exploration and exploitation phases in the exploration phase an optimization algorithm looks for promising regions of optimum solution in the global search domain while in the latter it tries to converge to global optimum around the obtained promising regions a recently proposed multiverse optimization mvo algorithm ensures a balance between exploration and exploitation phase by proving smooth transition from former to latter mirjalili et al 2016 in this study mvo is used as an optimization tool for the identification of contamination sources and transport parameters through eas lstm surrogate model simulations for a case study the performance of the proposed surrogate model is compared with that of widely used kriging and support vector regression svr based surrogate models moreover the performance of mvo is studied against that of gwo and pso algorithms 2 methodology 2 1 groundwater flow and transport simulation the steady state flow in a heterogeneous and anisotropic unconfined aquifer is governed by eq 1 bear and cheng 2010 rastogi 2007 1 x i Îº x i h h x i q here i represents the spatial dimensions of the problem domain xi represents the direction along the ith dimension the hydraulic conductivity and piezometric head are represented by Îº and h respectively the term q represents the source sink term present in the aquifer domain the boundary of the problem domain is subjected to dirichlet and neumann boundary conditions given by eq 2 and 3 respectively 2 h x i h o 3 Îº x i h n x i f o where h0 and f0 are known head and flux values respectively the

represent longitudinal and transverse dispersivities respectively the dirichlet and neumann type conditions for contaminant transport are given by eq 7 and 8 respectively 7 c x i c o 8 d x i x j c n x i g o where c0 and g0 are applicable known concentrations and fluxes respectively in this study the simulation is done using the meshfree radial point collocation method rpcm which has been successfully used for groundwater modelling meenal and eldho 2011 guneshwor et al 2018 anshuman et al 2019 anshuman and eldho 2020 in rpcm the problem domain is decomposed into several overlapping support domains which surround each node see fig 1 a variable h at location xi can be approximated using n nodes in its support domain as shown in eq 9 liu and gu 2005 9 h x i k 1 n f r k x i x k a k here f r k stands for multi quadrics radial basis function mq rbf evaluated for k th node in the local support domain which is given by kansa 1990a 1990b 10 f r x i x k x x k 2 Î± d c 2 q the term x x k represents the euclidean distance between node xi and the point of interest xk and dc is the average nodal distance considering all internal nodes the mq rbf shape parameters are denoted by q and Î± the unknown coefficients a k in eq 9 can be estimated by enforcing the mq rbf moment matrix to pass through the nodes in the local support domain as follows liu and gu 2005 11 a k 1 f r x 1 x 1 f r x 1 x k f r x k x 1 f r x k x k 1 h k 1 g 1 h k 1 where h is the approximated solution of the variable of h by substituting eq 11 in eq 9 the solution for h can be obtained as follows liu and gu 2005 12 h x i f r g 1 h Ï h the term Ï is referred to as shape function which is estimated for each node within its local support domain the derivatives of the shape functions concerning directions can be estimated by swapping the mq rbf vector f r in eq 12 with the corresponding derivative terms hence the rpcm solutions to the governing equation 1 can be represented in terms of the shape functions and their derivatives in eq 13 it should be noted that as the concerning pde is nonlinear with respect to h it is solved iteratively meenal and eldho 2011 13 Ï x i Îº x i h Ï x i Îº x i Ï x i h Ï x i

and eldho 2020 a detailed study on sensitivity analysis for the parameter Î¸ is given in anshuman and eldho 2020 2 2 a brief overview of lstm artificial neural networks ann such as feed forward neural networks ffnn has been used in the past due to their simplicity and high accuracy majumder and eldho 2020 singh and datta 2004 however in ffnn the time dependency in the input data is not learnt sequentially as the training data is flattened and the sequential temporal information is lost conversely in recurrent neural networks rnn the information is allowed to be carried over different time steps which are beneficial for learning the sequential dependency in the input data making it more suitable even for long time series kao et al 2020 neural networks are generally trained using the back propagation technique using gradient descent algorithms nevertheless rnns suffer from vanishing and exploding gradients issues increasingly with the time steps which aggravates the model training process this issue can be effectively dealt with by using long short term memory lstm hochreiter and schmidhuber 1997 which is a special type of rnn it uses a combination of three gates namely input forget and output see fig 2 a these gates operate on the given input i and hidden state h at time step t using sigmoid activation function Ï as shown in eqs 15 17 15 f t Ï w 1 f i t w 2 f h t 1 b f 16 i t Ï w 1 i i t w 2 i h t 1 b i 17 o t Ï w 1 o i t w 2 o h t 1 b o here ft it and ot are sigmoid activation vectors obtained from forget input and output gates respectively the respective terms w1 and w2 are weights associated with input and hidden state whereas b represents the bias vector the subscripts f i and o correspond to forget input and output gates respectively the cell state ct is computed using antecedent cell state vector c t which is a function of input at time t and hidden state vector of the previous time step eq 18 and 19 similarly hidden state ht is computed using ot and cell state ct eq 20 the notation refers to hadamard or the dot product between concerning vectors 18 c t t a n h w 1 c i t w 2 c h t 1 b c 19 c t f t c t 1 i t c t 20 h t o t t a n h c t 2 3 entity aware lstm and sequence to sequence learning as discussed in the introduction section the objective of the study is to develop a dnn which learns the relationship between the contaminant release history at source locations and observed concentrations at observation points subject to certain values of transport parameters the release history and contaminant observation data are sequential or dynamic on the other hand the transport parameters such as dispersivity Î±l and effective porosity Î· e are dependent on the soil type and are static as lstm requires both input and output data in sequential form a modified version of lstm i e entity aware long short term memory ealstm which can take both static and sequential variables as input is proposed for this study kratzert et al 2019 in ealstm the conventional lstm is modified by introducing the static variables in the input gate see fig 2b mathematically the gate operations in lstm i e eqs 15 20 are modified as follows kratzert et al 2019 21 f t Ï w 1 f i d t w 2 f h t 1 b f 22 i Ï w 1 i i st b i 23 o t Ï w 1 o i d t w 2 o h t 1 b o 24 c t t a n h w 1 c i d t w 2 c h t 1 b c 25 c t f t c t 1 i c t 26 h t o t t a n h c t here i d and i st are dynamic sequential and static inputs respectively note that the f and o gates are computed at every timestep using i d while the input gate i is evaluated only once using i st as shown in fig 2 in both lstm and ealstm each memory unit outputs a hidden state h t and cell state ct at each timestep the number of neurons used in the hidden states is generally higher than that of the input sequence zhang et al 2018 gao et al 2020 a fully connected layer is further used to transform these states to output zhang et al 2018 however this approach is not suitable when the lengths of input and output sequences are unequal as in the current study kao et al 2020 hence a sequence to sequence seq2seq learning strategy is employed which uses an encoder decoder technique to map the input sequence to output sequence kao et al 2020 xiang et al 2020 in this framework the input data is sequentially fed into the encoder in this study ealstm is proposed as the encoder as shown in fig 2 ealstm encodes the input into hidden and cell states are at each timestep the encoded hidden and cell states after the last timestep are set as initial states for the decoder lstm which generates the output hidden sequences recursively using a fully connected layer these hidden sequences are transformed into the output sequence this dnn architecture can accommodate input and output sequences of different lengths which is suitable for source identification problems as the stress periods of contaminant releases and measurements in observation wells can be of unequal lengths further for the current study the dnn is required to learn the input and output sequences for a given set of transport parameters i e zonal dispersivities and porosities which are static variables the proposed encoder decoder model for the study is named entity aware sequence to sequence learning using long short term memory eas lstm the architecture of the model is provided in fig 3 as observed the encoder takes both static and dynamic sequential variables the input gate i e eq 22 is evaluated only once and re used by ealstm at every timestep to evaluate corresponding hidden and cell states here it may be noted that a proxy input for the first timestep is provided at the decoder lstm for the first timestep the proxy input consists of a zero matrix as the input dataset used to train the eas lstm model are mutually exclusive hence decoder lstm is forced to learn the first timestep using encoded states from encoder ealstm only in the present study the dynamic sequential component of the input data i e release rates from source locations are arranged in matrix form as n sp n source where n sp and n source stand for the number of stress periods and source locations respectively on the other hand the static component i e zonal transport parameters are arranged in a vector form n t 1 where n t is the number of transport parameters similar to sequential input data the output data is arranged in n t n obs where n t and n obs are the number of timesteps and observation points respectively the model setup is presented in simplified form in fig 4 2 4 kriging kriging is a geostatistical approach in which the interpolated values are estimated by a gaussian process based on prior covariances matheron 1963 it has been applied in groundwater problems such as contaminant source identification zhao et al 2016 monitoring of groundwater monitoring network dhar and datta 2009 and prediction of groundwater depth nikroo et al 2010 the predicted output y is estimated by a linear combination of weighted deterministic function f x and realization of a stochastic process Î¾ x as follows 27 y i 1 k Î² i f i x Î¾ x here the mean of the realization Î¾ x is zero its covariance is estimated as follows 28 c o v z x i z x j Ï 2 r i j 1 n here Ï 2 r and n are process variance gaussian correlation function and the number of data points more details on the kriging method are provided in zhao et al 2016 in the present study the release rates and transport parameters are provided as the input vector similarly the btcs at observation wells are also obtained in the form of a vector 2 5 support vector regression support vector regression svr is a variant of support vector machine svm that tries to fit the input data to a hyperplane with some acceptable error svr has been used for contaminant source identification xing et al 2019 pan et al 2021 and groundwater potential mapping panahi et al 2020 in svr the model prediction y for input x is represented as follows 29 y Ï t Ï x Îµ where Ï is the coefficient vector Ï is the kernel function and Îµ is the bias in this study a commonly used radial basis function rbf kernel is applied al fugara et al 2020 the unknowns Ï and Îµ are estimated by solving the constrained minimization problem given by 30 minimize 1 2 Ï 2 c i 1 n Î¾ i such that 31 y i Ï i x i Îµ Î¾ i Î¾ i 0 i z 1 i n here Ï is the l2 norm of the coefficient matrix c is the regularization parameter and Î¾ is the relaxation parameter the term z and n represent integer and number of data points respectively the optimization problem can be solved using lagrange multipliers as given in xing et al 2019 the input and output data for the svr surrogate model are arranged in a similar way as explained in the previous section 2 6 optimization algorithms 2 6 1 multiverse optimization algorithm multi verse optimization mvo is a recently proposed stochastic population based optimizer mirjalili et al 2016 according to a popular theory in physics there exists a multiverse consisting of innumerable universes each created by a big bang tegmark 2004 in this algorithm the candidate solutions are referred to as universes these universes intermingle by exchanging components using white holes black holes and wormholes the black holes are observed throughout the universe and are known to devour anything close enough due to their immense gravitational force in contrast white holes eject matter into space and are theorized to be created due to a collision between universes eardley 1974 the wormholes are theorized as cosmic tunnels connecting different parts of space time even the multiverse morris and thorne 1988 in mvo it is assumed that only one of the universes i e the best universe contains a white hole while the others contain black holes mirjalili et al 2016 the objects are sent from the universe having a white hole to other universes through white hole black hole tunnels established by the roulette wheel mechanism mirjalili et al 2016 32 x i j x k j if r 1 n i i x i j otherwise here x i j is jth variable and n i i is the normalised inflation rate for of ith universe respectively and x k j denotes jth variable of kth universe selected through roulette wheel mechanism the term r 1 is the random number in 0 1 each universe is assigned an inflation rate that is proportional to the fitness value the best solution after each iteration is considered to the universe with the best inflation expansion rate in mvo the interaction between universes follows the following principles mirjalili et al 2016 1 a higher inflation rate denotes a higher probability of having a white hole 2 a higher inflation rate denotes a lower probability of having a black hole 3 the objects are sent through a white hole from the universe having a higher inflation rate 4 the objects are received through black holes through the universes having lower inflation rates 5 the objects from all universes may move towards the best universe through the wormholes irrespective of the inflation rates from the above rules it is established that the exploration of the search space is done using white holes black holes while the exploitation or local search is done using wormholes every universe can possess a wormhole the local changes in the universes through wormholes is accomplished by eq 33 mirjalili et al 2016 33 x i j x best j t d r u b j l b j r 4 l b j i f r 3 0 5 x best j t d r u b j l b j r 4 l b j o t h e r w i s e if r 2 w e p x i j otherwise where x best j is the jth variable of the best universe u b j and l b j are upper bounds and lower bounds of the jth variable and r 2 r 3 and r 4 are random numbers in 0 1 the terms wep and tdr represent wormhole existence probability and travelling distance rate respectively which are explained in eq 34 and 35 mirjalili et al 2016 34 we p t wep min t wep max w e p min t max 35 tdr 1 t t max 1 n here t and t max are the iteration number and maximum iteration number respectively it is observed that the wep increases linearly with the iteration number within the limits wep min wep max from eq 34 it is observed that the wormhole is only opened if r 2 w e p since wep increases linearly with the iteration number the chances of local search or exploitation increase and global search or exploration decreases with an increase in iteration number this essentially means that the mvo algorithm smoothly transforms from the dominance of the exploration phase to that of the exploitation phase in this study wep max and wep min are fixed as 1 and 0 2 respectively the exponent 1 n in eq 35 introduces non linearity to tdr with respect to iteration number in this study the value of n is fixed as 6 which is suggested by mirjalili et al 2016 higher values of n result in more accurate exploitation sayed et al 2019 the steps involved in mvo is presented in fig 5 2 6 2 grey wolf optimization gwo is an optimization algorithm inspired by the hunting behaviour of grey wolves mirjalili et al 2014 based on leadership and dominance the wolves are categorized into alpha beta delta and omega the first three categories lead the pack for hunting while omega wolves hound the prey alpha is the most dominant category followed by beta and delta mathematically the encircling of prey by the grey wolf pack is denoted as follows 36 d c x w t x i t 37 x i t 1 x w t a d the candidate solution is represented by the position of wolves in the pack i e x t where t denotes the iteration number x w t represents the position of the leading wolf alpha beta or delta a and c are the coefficients based on uniformly distributed random numbers further details of the gwo algorithm can be found in mirjalili et al 2014 and majumder and eldho 2020 2 6 3 particle swarm optimization pso is another stochastic population based algorithm that mimics the movement of a bird flock kennedy and eberhart 1995 here the position of each particle represents a candidate solution all particles possess some velocity which is updated in each iteration using which they traverse the search space the particle velocities are updated at the end of each iteration as follows 38 v i t 1 Ï v i t c 1 r 1 p best x i t c 2 r 2 g best x i t here Ï is the inertia coefficient and c 1 and c 2 are acceleration coefficients the terms r 1 and r 2 are the random numbers in the interval 0 1 the term p best and g best denote best positions of the particle and swarm respectively the positions of particles are updated after each iteration by 39 x i t 1 x i t v i t 3 problem statement and modelling framework 3 1 study area and numerical simulation the study area considered here is a hypothetical heterogeneous irregular unconfined aquifer which is a modified version of majumder and eldho 2017 see fig 6 two rivers are flowing towards the north along the east and west boundaries which enforce the dirichlet boundary condition the head values vary linearly along the river boundaries at the southernmost location the head values are 760 m and 720 m for east and west boundaries respectively the head value at the confluence located at the north is 710 m the southern boundary is impervious or no flux boundary a recharge of 6 5 10 3 m d enters the aquifer through a recharge zone as shown in fig 6 the flow in the aquifer is assumed to be in steady state the total aquifer area of 29 13 km2 is divided into four distinct zones of different hydrogeological parameters see fig 6 the hydraulic conductivities of these zones are presented in table 1 the hydraulic conductivity decreases from east to west direction with an exception of zone 3 which has low hydraulic conductivity of Îº 2 m d the transport parameters i e longitudinal dispersivity and porosity values of these zones are presented in table 1 the transverse dispersity of a zone of the aquifer is assumed as 0 3 times the longitudinal dispersity of the concerned zone it may be noted that these values of the aquifer parameters are suitably assumed from existing literature ayvaz 2010 li et al 2020 2021 in this study we assume three potential contamination sources s1 s2 and s3 located in the aquifer see fig 6 which inject tritium into the aquifer for 4 years in 4 stress periods each spanning 1 year the contaminant considered tritium is reactive half life 12 32 years or Î» 0 000153 d 1 hence the total number of unknowns is 20 3 possible source locations 4 stress periods 8 transport parameters the concentrations are measured at seven observation points located at ob1 ob2 ob3 ob4 ob5 ob6 and ob7 see fig 6 for the synthetic case study numerically simulated concentrations are assumed as observed concentrations the rpcm model is developed for the problem with 1585 nodes with a uniform nodal distance dc of 131 m in x and y directions as discussed the shape functions are required to discretize the governing equations concerning the flow and transport process these shape functions are estimated with mq rbfs with shape parameters q Î± and local support domain size of 0 98 5 and 3 dc respectively these parameters are adopted from the previous studies anshuman et al 2019 anshuman and eldho 2020 singh et al 2016 which provide detailed parameter sensitivity analysis further rpcm simulations are also compared with widely used modflow harbaugh 2005 and mt3dms zheng and wang 1999 in this study the simulated head values are shown in fig 7 and table 2 it is observed that the rpcm simulations match closely with that of modflow at the observation points with a maximum percentage difference of 0 19 considering the travel time required for contaminants to reach the observation points the rpcm model is simulated for 15 years for the release rates given in table 3 it may be noted that these rates are required to be estimated along with transport parameters in table 2 finer time step size increases the model stability at expense of computational time considering this the time step size of 10 days is selected for simulation the movement of contamination plumes in the aquifer throughout the simulation period are presented in fig 8 the rpcm and mt3dms simulated breakthrough curves btc at the observation points are presented in fig 9 the error indicators mean absolute error mae ppm root mean squared error rmse ppm and normalized rmse are computed for the btc obtained at observation locations see table 4 the normalization is done with respect to the maximum concentration obtained by the mt3dms model at the observation wells at some locations the rpcm simulated btcs are observed to rise earlier later compared to that of mt3dms as shown in fig 9 such minor differences are generally observed when two different numerical models are compared especially in the case of a heterogeneous aquifer with irregular boundaries pathania et al 2019 anshuman and eldho 2020 apart from that rpcm model simulations match very well with the results of mt3dms with maximum values of mae rmse and normalized rmse being 1 098 ppm 1 421 ppm and 0 152 respectively the computational time required for the simulation is 34 39 s using an intel i7 10th gen system having 16 gb ram and 2 2 ghz which is aimed to be reduced using the eas lstm surrogate model 3 2 objective function as mentioned in section 3 1 the release rates at the possible source locations and transport parameters i e longitudinal dispersity and porosity are required to be estimated for this inverse modelling problem the error between simulated and observed concentrations at the observation points for contamination release history is minimized the mathematical formulation of the objective function is given by guneshwor et al 2018 40 min 1 n obs i 1 n obs j 1 n t c nor m ij obs c nor m ij

surrogate model simulated concentrations at the observation points respectively the terms n obs and n t represent the number of observation wells and the number of observed timesteps respectively the normalized concentrations at the observation points c norm sim is a function of contamination strength q at n source locations and aquifer parameters Î± l and Î· e at n zones as shown in eq 41 the superscripts l and u in the constraint terms i e eq 41 denote the lower and upper bounds of the variables used in this study which are also presented in table 5 3 2 1 erroneous concentrations it is evident from the objective function i e eq 40 that the performance of the model significantly depends on the accuracy of the observed concentration data at the observation wells however in practice the measurement of the observed concentrations at the observation wells is susceptible to human and instrumental errors yeh et al 2007 considering this the robustness of the proposed model is analyzed using perturbed observation data by using a random normal deviate given by 42 c obs c obs 1 n 0 Ï here n 0 Ï denotes the random normal deviate of mean 0 and standard deviation Ï in this study Ï is taken as 0 1 the function randn from numpy oliphant 2006 is used for generating random numbers the observed concentration in the objective function in eq 40 is replaced with perturbed observed concentrations c obs the mean deviations from the c obs is 0 016 ppm 3 3 sensitivity analysis in sso the optimization model searches for unknowns i e contaminant release histories and transport parameters by minimizing the objective function explained in eq 40 which depends on the difference between the simulated and observed btcs at the observation points here the impact of the unknown variables on this difference is investigated each variable is changed by 50 to 50 of its actual value keeping the other variables unchanged as denoted in tables 1 and 3 with increments of 10 for each analysis the variables other than the concerned variable are fixed as in tables 1 and 3 the mean difference in normalized observed and simulated concentrations for the altered variable is plotted in fig 10 to give equal weightage to all observation points the observed and simulated btcs are normalized it is observed that the mean difference is most sensitive to the porosity of zone 1 and zone 3 the porosity of the medium affects the velocity and the occurrence of peak concentration as seen in fig 8 the contaminant released from s2 located in zone 1 impacts 4 out of a total of 7 observation points in the aquifer the high sensitivity of the mean difference to the porosity values corresponding to these zones is explained by the presence of these observation points in zone 1 and zone 3 similarly the mean difference is more sensitive to the dispersivity values of these zones compared to other zones 3 4 surrogate simulation optimization the steps involved in the development of surrogate simulation optimization model are given as follows 1 data pre processing the input data for eas lstm training comprises dynamic or sequential data i e contamination strengths at source locations and static data i e transport parameters Î±l and Î·e for each set of input data rpcm model simulated btcs at the observation points are used as output uniform random sampling is used to generate input data for the given sample size and corresponding simulated concentrations are estimated by rpcm these data are normalized between respective maximum and minimum values to facilitate the training of the surrogate model in this study a total of 2500 samples are generated out of which 2000 samplesare used for model training and the accuracy of the trained model is tested on 500 samples it may be noted that the neural network during the training process is blind to the samples used for the testing the time required for the generation of the sample is 2 86 h the sequential and static input data are arranged in n sample n sp n s and n sample n t forms respectively here n sample n sp n s and n t denote numbers of samples stress periods potential sources and transport parameters respectively similarly the output data is arranged in n sample n t n o here n t and n o represent numbers of time steps in btcs and observation points respectively it is to be noted that the prior knowledge of the groundwater flow system and btcs at the observation points assists in determining the potential sources of the contamination 2 eas lstm model architecture eas lstm model is developed in pytorch paszke et al 2019 the input data is fed into the encoder ealstm and encoded into hidden states ct and ht for decoder lstm a zero matrix of shape n s 1 n o is provided as teacher forcing for the first timestep the encoded states from encoder ealstm i e ct and ht are set as initial states for decoder lstm for the subsequent timesteps the output from the previous lstm cell is provided as input the output from the decoder lstm is set as input to a dense layer with linear activation 3 training the eas lstm model is trained using the adaptive moment estimation adam algorithm kingma and ba 2014 the trainable model parameters weights and biases are optimized using the gradient descent technique by minimizing the mean squared difference between the training data and predicted data the model is trained for 2500 epochs using a batch size of 200 the trainable model parameters i e weights and biases in eq 21 24 are saved at the end of each epoch where the testing mse betters its previous value the model parameters corresponding to the least values of testing mse are used for prediction 4 evaluation once the eas lstm model is trained it can be used for prediction the sequential and static input data for the trained model is required to be in the same format as step 1 the encoder ealstm converts the input data into an encoded state which is further decoded by the decoder lstm for computation of output sequence as described in step 2 the decoder lstm necessitates a zero tensor as teacher forcing for the first timestep the model performance is evaluated for the training and testing dataset 5 optimization a sso model is developed using eas lstm mvo and the objective function the mvo algorithm is utilized to estimate the unknown variables i e contamination release rates and transport parameters by minimizing the objective function described in eq 40 which uses eas lstm model simulations the population for the variables is initiated within the upper and lower bounds it is to be noted that the inputs to the eas lstm model are required to be normalized using max min normalization as shown in eqs 43 45 43 q norm i q i min q max q min q 44 t norm i t i min t max t min t 45 c norm i c i min c max c min c here q and t imply the dynamic sequential and static input variables respectively c denotes the output variable it is to be noted that the maximum and minimum values of q t and c are computed for the entire sample size the predictions of eas lstm which are normalized values are scaled up to provide the required output sequence these predictions are used for computing the objective function which is to be minimized iteratively the best solution is updated at each iteration the methodology used for solving the source identification and parameter estimation problem using eas lstm and mvo is presented in fig 11 3 5 performance evaluation the performance of an sso model depends on the accuracy of the surrogate model to approximate the simulation model and the ability of the optimization algorithm to find the global optimum the following error metrics are used to evaluate the performance of the sso model 46 r 2 1 i 1 n obs j 1 n t c ij obs c ij sim 2 i 1 n obs j 1 n t c ij obs c ij sim 2 47 rmss i 1 n source j 1 n t q ij act q ij pred 2 n source 48 rmst i 1 n t t i act t i pred 2 n t 49 rmso i 1 n obs j 1 n t c ij obs c ij sim 2 n obs here q and t denote the contamination strengths at the source locations and transport parameters respectively the superscripts act and pred correspond to actual and predicted values respectively the terms n source n t n obs n sp and n t denote the number of potential source locations transport parameters observation well stress periods and timesteps respectively in this study the performance of eas lstm is compared with that of kriging and svr the mvo gwo and pso are used as optimization algorithms the accuracy of the sso models is signified by the proximity of r2 to 1 and low values of rmss rmst and rmso 4 model applications 4 1 predictive accuracy of surrogate models the surrogate models eas lstm kriging and svr are used for the prediction of btcs at the observation wells for given contaminant release histories at source locations and transport parameters a trained surrogate model must approximate the simulation model accurately to be effectively used in combination with optimization to estimate unknown variables the training and testing data set used for all the three surrogate models are the same as presented in section 3 4 to test the generalization capability of the surrogate models the k fold cross validation technique refaeilzadeh et al 2009 is used where the value of k is set to 5 the mean convergence curve of the eas lstm model using different folds sets of training samples is presented in fig 12 the minimum value of mean squared error mse obtained for the training is 1 7 10 6 ppm2 the mean values of different error indicators i e mae ppm rmse ppm and r2 for training and testing datasets are compared in fig 13 for all surrogate models it is observed that the proposed eas lstm model provides lower values of mae and rmse and a higher value of r2 in comparison to kriging and svr models it may be noted that the standard deviation values obtained by the eas lstm models using different combinations of training and testing data are low as shown in fig 13 the btcs at different observation wells simulated by the surrogate models for the current study are presented in fig 14 using the input variables in table 1 and table 3 the eas lstm model is observed to reconstruct the actual btcs more accurately compared to kriging and svr the corresponding mse and r2 values are presented in table 6 which shows that the eas lstm model predictions are most accurate it may be noted that the mse and r2 are computed using concatenated btcs the time required per simulation in eas lstm is 0 031 s which is higher than that of kriging however it is 1066 5 times faster than the simulation model which takes 33 06 s the training of eas lstm is done in nvidia geforce 1660 ti gpu the training time is significantly higher than that of kriging and svr models which is generally the case in lstms based deep neural networks li et al 2021 4 2 inverse modelling results 4 2 1 scenario 1 in this inverse modelling problem the release histories at source locations and zonal transport parameters are required to be estimated using the btcs at the observation points for the current scenario no error in the contaminant measurement is assumed i e model simulated concentrations at the observation points see fig 9 are used for the formulation of the objective function in eq 40 the simulations from the surrogate models i e eas lstm kriging and svr which drastically reduce the computational time are used as c sim and used in the objective function the unknowns are estimated by three optimization models mvo gwo and pso using population size and maximum iteration number of 100 and 3000 respectively which indicates that the surrogate models are called 300 000 times by the optimization algorithms the upper and lower bounds of the unknowns are set as per table 5 the evolution of objective function with iteration number for the sso models is presented in fig 15 as seen in table 7 the minimum value of the objective function obtained is least for eas lstm and mvo compared to its counterparts the 20 estimated unknown variables are presented in fig 16 the eas lstm mvo model is observed to give accurate results compared to other counterparts the error metrics rmss and rmst obtained are the least for eas lstm mvo as seen in table 8 which denotes that the release histories and transport parameters are accurately estimated further the low value of rmso indicates that the eas lstm can reconstruct the btcs at the observation points more precisely using mvo estimated variables similarly the performance of mvo and gwo are similar and are better than that of pso using kriging nonetheless the reconstructed btcs using kriging and svr are not as accurate as eas lstm see fig 14 and table 8 resulting in an imprecise estimation of the unknowns 4 2 2 scenario 2 given the vulnerability of the observed concentrations to human and instrumental errors perturbed observed concentrations c obs as mentioned in section 3 2 1 are used in the objective function in eq 40 these concentrations at different observation points are presented in fig 17 the sso models discussed in section 4 2 1 for all noise levels are run to estimate the unknowns the population size and number of iterations are the same as described in section 4 2 1 for all optimization models the results obtained are presented in fig 18 and table 9 it is observed that the eas lstm mvo model provides low values of rmst and rmso however the rmss and rmso values obtained by eas lstm gwo is lower compared to eas lstm mvo interestingly kriging mvo and kriging gwo models give slightly better results than that of the eas lstm mvo model in terms of r2 which denotes better estimation of unknowns however as per the mathematical formulation of the objective function the eas lstm mvo converged to a lesser value as observed in table 10 on the contrary the error metrics concerning the svr surrogate model denotes its poor performance to obtain the unknowns the reason can be attributed to the low accuracy of the trained svr surrogate model to reconstruct the unperturbed btcs at observation wells as observed in section 4 1 5 discussion the current study proposes a novel dnn named eas lstm for the estimation of contaminant release histories at potential sources and zonal transport parameters in the aquifer for given observed contamination data the dnn uses an ealstm kratzert et al 2019 for taking sequential and static components of the input and transforming them into an encoded state the timestep wise outputs are generated by a decoder lstm recursively the developed model is applied to a heterogeneous aquifer with 4 distinct zones having known hydraulic conductivities it is required to estimate the release intensities of tritium from 3 prospective source locations and zonal transport parameters i e longitudinal dispersivity and effective porosities for observed concentrations at 7 observation points scattered throughout the aquifer the data required for the training of the eas lstm is generated using the meshfree rpcm model the mae rmse and r2 values obtained using k fold cross validation indicate that the eas lstm performs better compared to kriging and svr consequently the eas lstm model reproduces the btcs at 7 observation wells compared to the other two surrogate models the training time requirement of eas lstm is much higher than that of kriging and svr which is expected as lstms are more computationally intensive however the prediction time is only 0 031 s which is 1066 5 times lower than the simulation model i e 33 06 s this drastic reduction in computational time allows for higher population size and iteration numbers in inverse modelling for inverse modelling three stochastic population based optimization algorithms having unique search space exploration strategies i e mvo gwo and pso were utilized using surrogate model simulations the pso implements the movement of the bird flock by updating the position of the candidate solutions based on the best positions of the individual candidates and overall swarm population as shown in eqs 38 and 39 the gwo implements the hunting behaviour of the grey wolves and the position of candidate solutions are updated by encircling the prey principle as per eqs 36 and 37 in contrast to pso and gwo the mvo algorithm changes the candidate solutions through two steps it is accomplished through roulette wheel selection and local exploitation using wep and tdr parameters see eqs 32 35 the roulette wheel selection is accomplished at each iteration to facilitate the exchange of information between the best and other candidate solutions the wep parameter ensures that the mvo algorithm makes a smooth transition from the dominance of the exploration phase to the exploitation phase with an increase in the number of iterations the sso models are applied to two scenarios in the first scenario the btcs at the observation points are considered error free while in the second a random noise is added deliberately to the evaluation of sso model performances it is observed that the combination eas lstm and mvo provides better results in comparison to other surrogate models in estimating the unknown release rates and transport parameters moreover the btcs obtained eas lstm mvo estimated variables also closely match with observed concentrations yielding less value of rmso in scenario 2 the performances of kriging gwo and kriging pso models are better in terms of r2 nonetheless the minimum value obtained by eas lstm mvo is lower than that of the aforementioned sso models which denote that the minimization of the objective function is handled better by mvo some previous studies have also indicated the superiority of the mvo against gwo and pso benmessahel et al 2018 kumar et al 2019 considering the time required for sample generation 2 86 h training 0 62 h and optimization 2 6 h the computational time required for the eas lstm mvo model is 6 08 h on the other hand if the optimization model is embedded with the simulation model the computational time required would approximately be 2755 h for the same population size and iteration number in the optimization algorithm moreover once the eas lstm model is trained it can be used repetitively for different analyses which means that the cost required for optimization will only be considered although the proposed sso framework has demonstrated significant advantages compared to other sso models discussed in the study it is noteworthy that the time required for training is more in eas lstm and it requires graphical processing units gpu as training is prohibitively expensive for a large sample size and hidden neurons without gpus furthermore in the current study the lengths of the input and output sequences are unequal and the output sequence 55 steps is over 13 times lengthier compared to the input sequence 4 steps for simpler problems having shorter sequence lengths shallow machine learning algorithms may be more suitable wunsch et al 2021 6 conclusions the source identification and parameter estimation are conventionally done using the s o approach however as s o models are computationally expensive a modelling framework using a surrogate model named eas lstm is proposed in this study which uses ealstm as an encoder and lstm as a decoder the performance comparison with kriging and svr models suggests that the proposed surrogate model can approximate the simulation model more accurately although the time required for training is higher in the case of the eas lstm model amongst the sso models developed for estimation of unknowns the combination of eas lstm and mvo was found to be more effective to estimate the unknown variables i e release rates at source locations and transport parameters compared to other sso models moreover the eas lstm is over 1000 times faster than the simulation model owing to the accuracy and computational efficiency of the surrogate model the eas lstm model can be efficiently used for source identification and parameter estimation of large scale field problems credit authorship contribution statement aatish anshuman
