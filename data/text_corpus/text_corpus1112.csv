5560,global climate change is likely to change the timing frequency and magnitude of precipitation events studying the response of sap flow sf of plants to rainfall events is thus important for understanding the response of ecosystems to global climate change here we conducted a comprehensive study on the sf rainfall events meteorological factors and soil water content swc for two typical xerophytic shrub stands caragana korshinskii and salix psammophila on the loess plateau of china for two rainy seasons june september in 2015 and 2016 the rainfall events were classified into three rainfall categories using the k means clustering based on the rainfall amount ra rainfall duration rd and rainfall intensity ri category i lowest mean ra rd and ri category ii moderate mean ra ri and highest mean rd and category iii highest mean ra ri and moderate mean rd the results showed that the response of sf at both c korshinskii and s psammophila stands to rainfall events differed within the three categories the occurrence of rainfall events significantly decreased daily sf of c korshinskii in three rainfall categories whereas the daily sf of s psammophila is more strongly influenced by rainfall category ii maximum decreases in daily sf between the pre rainfall and the rainfall weather condition of the two stands both occurred in rainfall category ii daily rainfall sf at both stands was strongly correlated with daily sr rh and vpd regardless of the rainfall categories diurnal variation of hourly sf at both stands also differed among the days with similar ra and rd in the same rainfall category it can be inferred that sf of c korshinskii is more susceptible to rainfall events than s psammophila rainfall characteristics ra rd and ri and rainfall distribution should be fully considered when assessing the response of sf of shrubs to rainfall events keywords sap flow rainfall category inter specific variation xerophytic shrub drylands 1 introduction rainfall is considered a major driver of the distribution and abundance of vegetation in drylands kwarteng et al 2009 and most precipitation events in drylands are small in magnitude 5 mm and short in duration 30 mins cavanaugh et al 2011 in these systems rainfall is the main natural source to recover soil water which provides available water for plant transpiration dymond et al 2017 ungar et al 2013 thus plant productivity is particularly sensitive to precipitation inputs fay 2009 huxman et al 2004 ogle and reynolds 2004 studies have shown that global climate change is expected to increase atmospheric water demand and terrestrial evapotranspiration greve et al 2014 novick et al 2016 which may offset modest increases in precipitation and reduce the soil water availability for vegetation growth allen et al 2015 wu et al 2017 the decline in soil water availability could exert negative impacts on transpiration and result in variations in hydrological cycling dymond et al 2017 therefore it is very essential to investigate the rainfall soil moisture vegetation response interactions under climate change in drylands evapotranspiration generally accounts for more than 95 of the water lost in many dryland ecosystems williams et al 2004 and globally transpiration is about 64 13 of evapotranspiration good et al 2015 sap flow sf is an important indicator of water movement in plants and can be used to indicate the instantaneous transpiration of plants kume et al 2008 steppe et al 2010 zhang et al 2018 zhao et al 2009 global climate change is likely to increase the variability of precipitation patterns zhao and liu 2010 many studies found that climate induced changes in regional precipitation could have important implications for the water cycles of dryland ecosystems wullschleger and hanson 2006 studied the sensitivity of canopy transpiration to altered precipitation in an upland oak forest and found that supplemental precipitation added to the wet plot increased seasonal canopy transpiration of upland oak on average 9 compared with the ambient plot zeppel et al 2008 studied the response of sf to rainfall pulse in a temperate australian woodland and found that the size of rainfall event could significantly affect the response of sf to rainfall du et al 2011 focused on species differences in sf characteristics in response to rainfall pulse and found that rainfall pulses could significantly increase sf of robinia pseudoacacia quercus liaotungensis and armeniaca sibirica thus studying the response of plant sf to changes in timing frequency and magnitude of precipitation events could be important for formulating reasonable water management strategies in dryland ecosystems in the context of global climatic change dunkerley 2009 shrubs are the representative plant functional type in dryland ecosystems yuan et al 2017 in these ecosystems sf is generally monitored using the stem heat balance method in the field naithani et al 2012 vincent et al 2007 a number of studies have examined the dynamics of sf at multiple timescales and or its relationship with influencing factors fisher et al 2007 moran et al 2009 zhao et al 2016 while only few studies have explored the influence of rainfall pulses on sf of dryland shrubs huxman et al 2004 found that redistribution of soil water led to great infiltration and increase in photosynthetic water use of vascular plants following relatively larger pulses or a series of small pulses cavanaugh et al 2011 examined the partitioning of precipitation inputs into soil evaporation and transpiration and found that a series of large precipitation events could increase soil moisture at deep layers and trigger transpiration of larrea tridentata yang et al 2014 studied the physiological characteristic of haloxylon ammodendron to rainfall and argued that the soil water status of h ammodendron is highly sensitive to rainfall pulses and a 6 mm or greater rainfall amount ra is effective precipitation for h ammodendron from the perspective of plant physiology in previous studies rainfall events were usually classified into different rainfall classes based on ra and the influence of rainfall events on shrubs sf and transpiration were then evaluated by directly comparing sf and transpiration amongst different rainfall classes huang and zhang 2016 jian et al 2016 zhao and liu 2010 other rainfall parameters such as rainfall duration rd rainfall intensity ri and changes in the timing and magnitude of rainfall pulses may also affect the activity of plants in dryland ecosystems huxman et al 2004 szutu and papuga 2019 therefore there is a clear need for a comprehensive analysis of the response of sf dynamics of shrubs to rainfall characteristics in this study we measured ra rd a suite of meteorological factors soil water content swc and sf of two xerophytic shrub species caragana korshinskii and salix psammophila on the loess plateau in northern china for two rainy seasons in 2015 and 2016 june september the rainfall events were classified into different rainfall categories based on ra rd and ri the objectives were to investigate 1 daily pre rainfall and rainfall sf of c korshinskii and s psammophila within different rainfall categories 2 relationships between daily sf and influencing factors within different rainfall categories and 3 correlations between daily and hourly sf dynamics with rainfall categories 2 materials and methods 2 1 study site the study area is located in the liudaogou catchment 110 21 110 23 e 38 46 38 51 n 1274 m a s l of shenmu county shaanxi province china fig 1 a the catchment has an area of 6 89 km2 and belongs to the transitional zone between the loess plateau and the mu us desert this region has a moderate temperate continental climate and the average annual rainfall is about 437 mm 1971 2013 the precipitation is concentrated in july to september a period which accounts for 70 of the annual rainfall the mean annual temperature is 8 4 c ranging from 9 7 c in january to 23 7 c in july and the mean annual reference evapotranspiration calculated by the penman monteith equation is 1200 mm liu and shao 2014 the groundwater table in the study area is more than 20 m below the surface and precipitation is the most important available water resource for local ecosystem soils in the study area are mostly sandy loess and sand most of the natural vegetation in the watershed has been disturbed due to long term human activities in recent decades the ecological restoration has been carried out by planting arid land perennial native shrubs such as s psammophila and c korshinskii in this study we selected two representative experimental stands of c korshinskii and s psammophila in the southwest corner of the liudaogou catchment fig 1a c korshinskii usually grows to 2 m height and has pinnate compound leaves in an opposite or sub opposite arrangement in comparison s psammophila usually grows to 3 4 m height and has an odd number of strip shaped leaves yuan et al 2017 both c korshinskii and s psammophila have inverted cone canopy and no trunk with multiple branches running obliquely from the base these two shrubs species were planted approximately 22 years ago and more detailed information for the two selected stands can be found in a previous study yuan et al 2017 2 2 sap flow measurements we measured the sf of c korshinskii and s psammophila during the rainy seasons from june to september in 2015 and 2016 sap flow gauges flow 32 dynamic inc houston tx usa which are based on the energy balance method were used to measure sf in the stems fig 1b the main criteria to select stem for sap flow measurements was stem diameter before the gauges were set up diameters of 180 and 261 stems of four shrubs in the c korshinskii and s psammophila stands respectively were measured to determine the mean and range of stem diameters in each stand rana et al 2005 a total of 14 gauges were deployed to measure sf in the two selected stands during the study periods in each year for c korshinskii sf was measured in six stems using six gauges in total including two gauges of each model for 13 mm sga13 and 19 mm sgb19 one gauge of each model for 16 mm sgb16 and 25 mm sgb25 for s psammophila eight stems were monitored using a 9 mm sga9 13 mm sga13 19 mm sgb19 and 25 mm sgb25 and two of each model for 10 mm sga10 and 16 mm sgb16 diameters of these selected stems ranged from 14 5 to 26 4 mm and from 8 8 to 32 1 mm which covered more than 91 and 93 of stem diameter ranges in the c korshinskii and s psammophila stands respectively thus these measured stem could reflect the sf characteristics in the stands diameter and cross sectional area of these selected stems to measure sf in the two stands are shown in table 1 the selected fourteen stems were in good condition and well developed to support the weight of the gauge and survived throughout the study period we carefully installed the gauges according to the instructions recommend by the manufacturer we smoothed these selected stems to remove any superficial bark roughness using a razor blade and attached gauges to the stem as least 40 cm above the soil surface to reduce solar heating each gauge was protected from the weather using a shield wrapping of several layers of aluminum foil after the installation of the sensor heater input voltage of gauges was monitored and adjusted based on the sensor voltage requirements assuming a steady state condition for stem temperature during a small time interval sf g s 1 can be quantified using the following equation baker and bavel 1987 kigalu 2007 1 sf p in q cd q r q s c w t d t u where pin is the heater power input w qcd is the heat conduction loss along the stem up and down stream heat lost w qr is the radial heat conduction loess w qs is the heat stored in the stem section w cw is the specific heat of water j g 1 k 1 td k and tu k are the stem temperatures measured at defined distances downstream and upstream from the heater respectively the signals output from the gauges were recorded at 10 s intervals and stored as 30 min averages using a cr1000 data logger campbell scientific logan usa 2 3 meteorology and soil water content measurements in each selected experimental stand a tipping bucket rainfall gauge rg3 m onset computer corp bourne ma usa 0 2 mm per tip was installed to record the incident precipitation depth and timing three standard rain gauges inner diameter 20 cm were placed around in each rg3 m rainfall gauge to adjust the precipitation amount as an inherent underestimation of automatic precipitation recording groisman and legates 1994 rainfall characteristics such as ra mm rd h and ri mm h 1 could be obtained accordingly the characteristics of the rainfall events ra rd and ri are shown in fig 2 during the rainy seasons rainfall events were recorded on 46 and 41 days in 2015 and 2016 respectively the total precipitation in the rainy season of 2015 was 204 8 mm with the longest rd of 16 h whereas the total precipitation in the rainy season of 2016 was 382 mm with the longest rd of 11 h despite the overall wet rainy season in 2016 the highest ri of 12 8 mm h 1 occurred on august 9th 2015 considering the effects of gully micro geomorphology we also installed a meteorological station in each experimental stand to measure meteorological factors such as air temperature at c and relative humidity rh at a height of 1 5 m from the ground model hmp 155 vaisala helsinki finland solar radiation sr w m 2 model cnr 4 kipp zonen b v delft the netherlands and wind speed ws m s 1 at a height of 2 m from the ground model 03002 r m young company traverse city michigan usa the data were recorded every 5 min using a cr1000 datalogger campbell scientific logan usa and then stored as the 30 min mean data during the study periods vapor pressure deficit vpd kpa was calculated with at and rh according to the method of campbell and norman 1998 in each study plot we monitored the volumetric soil water content swc m3 m 3 along two replicate profiles within and between the canopy using the ec 5 soil moisture probes decagon devices inc pullman wa usa buried at eight depths below the soil surface 10 20 40 60 80 120 160 and 200 cm the data were recorded at 30 min intervals with a hobo logger h21 onset computer corp bourne ma usa the monitored soil water content data was calibrated and corrected against the gravimetric method soil relative extractable water rew of each stand was calculated as follows granier 1987 2 rew swc s w c wp sw c fc s w c wp where swcwp and swcfc are the soil wilting point and field capacity respectively and these values were derived from the soil water characteristic curve an rew of 0 4 was considered to be the threshold of soil water deficits during the study periods chirino et al 2011 2 4 rainfall categories the rainfall events were classified into different rainfall categories using a non hierarchical clustering method the non hierarchical approach requires a priori concept about the numbers of clusters hair et al 1998 in this study the 87 rainfall events during the two rainy seasons were classified into three rainfall categories based on ra rd and ri using the k means clustering table 2 starting from these cluster centres the rainfall events are selected into the three clusters in the way that keeps the overall within group variance at a minimum various distance measures such as euclidean distance hamming distance and minkowski distance can be used to quantify the similarity or the differences among the rainfall events to be classified horváth 2002 attempts were made until the most suitable clusters appeared and normally and the classification must meet the one way analysis of variance anova criterion of significant level p 0 05 wei et al 2007 as shown in table 2 rainfall category i has the lowest values of mean ra rd and ri 1 2 1 0 mm 2 3 1 1 h and 0 6 0 4 mm h 1 respectively rainfall category ii has moderate mean ra highest mean rd and moderate mean ri 8 2 5 1 mm 7 9 2 6 h and 1 0 0 4 mm h 1 respectively rainfall category iii has the highest mean ra moderate mean rd and highest mean ri 16 5 15 7 mm 4 1 2 6 h and 4 0 2 7 mm h 1 respectively during the two rainy seasons rainfall events had the frequent occurrence of 48 3 for rainfall category i followed by 28 7 for rainfall category ii and 22 9 for rainfall category iii table 2 2 5 statistical analysis the hourly sf was calculated as the average output of sap in one hour for these selected stems daily sf of each stand was the sum of hourly sf in a day summary statistics such as means standard deviation and variation coefficient of ra rd ri sf meteorological factors swc and rew within different rainfall categories were calculated anova was performed to evaluate the statistical differences of daily meteorological factors swc and rew at different soil layers amongst the three rainfall categories the statistical differences of daily pre rainfall and rainfall sf among different rainfall categories were also evaluated the pearson correlation analysis was used to test the significance of the relationship of sf with influencing factors at daily scales the level of significance was set at 95 confidence interval p 0 05 all statistical analyses were performed with spss 16 0 spss inc usa 3 results 3 1 meteorology and soil water content the temporal variation of daily sr at rh ws and vpd during the june september rainy seasons in 2015 and 2016 are shown in fig 3 there were no noticeable differences in daily sr at rh ws and vpd between the stand of c korshinskii and s psammophila p 0 05 daily sr at rh ws and vpd showed obvious seasonal variations during the experimental period of each year daily sr at rh ws and vpd during the study periods in 2015 and 2016 were from 18 9 to 363 2 and 13 6 353 1 w m 2 9 4 27 7

category i and lowest in category ii p 0 05 while for daily mean ws no significant differences could be detected within different rainfall categories p 0 05 daily mean sr and at were significantly lower in rainfall category ii than in categories i and iii p 0 05 and daily mean rh was lower in rainfall category i than in categories ii and iii p 0 05 during the experimental period of time daily swc and rew of c korshinskii and s psammophila showed different patterns along the soil profile fig 4 while the top 40 cm of the soil was more responsive to precipitation the lower soil layers fluctuated little during the rainy seasons particularly for c korshinskii swc at the s psammophila however fluctuated strongly even to the depth of 120 200 cm daily swc0 40 cm and swc120 200 cm of c korshinskii ranged from 0 13 0 28 m3 m 3 and 0 16 0 18 m3 m 3 respectively during the two rainy seasons while for s psammophila corresponding values were from 0 03 to 0 11 m3 m 3 and 0 04 to 0 14 m3 m 3 respectively for c korshinskii daily rew at different layers was consistently higher than the threshold of soil moisture deficit during the study periods p 0 05 while for s psammophila soil moisture deficit was detected at all three soil layers the mean daily swc0 40 cm and rew0 40 cm of both stands were significantly higher in rainfall categories ii and iii than in rainfall category i p 0 05 while at the 40 120 cm and 120 200 cm soil layers no significant differences could be detected in daily mean swc and rew of either stand among different rainfall categories p 0 05 fig 5 the mean daily swc and rew of c korshinskii were consistently higher than s psammophila regardless of the soil layers and rainfall categories p 0 05 3 2 daily sf dynamics within different rainfall categories daily rainfall sf were classified according to the rainfall category for both c korshinskii and s psammophila during the experimental period of time fig 6 there were 38 22 and 19 daily sf data in rainfall category i ii and iii during the study period respectively daily rainfall sf of c korshinskii ranged from 311 2 to 2730 5 g d 1 from 65 6 to 1999 4 g d 1 and from 50 8 to 2756 9 g d 1 in rainfall category i ii and iii respectively while for s psammophila corresponding range values were 251 2 2753 4 g d 1 132 6 1414 2 g d 1 and 85 1 2698 4 g d 1 respectively daily rainfall sf measured at both c korshinskii and s psammophila stands were notably higher in summer 2015 than that of 2016 in rainfall categories i and iii there was no obvious trend in relationship between daily rainfall sf of c korshinskii and s psammophila in the same rainfall category for both c korshinskii and s psammophila stands no significant difference in mean daily pre rainfall sf among different rainfall categories was observed p 0 05 while the mean daily rainfall sf was significantly lower in rainfall category ii than in rainfall categories i and iii p 0 05 fig 7 daily mean pre rainfall sf of c korshinskii and s psammophila was 2048 1 599 3 and 1536 9 727 9 g d 1 1783 9 692 9 and 1243 9 492 9 g d 1 and 1832 3 557 3 and 1344 3 673 2 g d 1 in rainfall category i ii and iii respectively the occurrence of rainfall events significantly reduced daily sf of c korshinskii in three rainfall categories p 0 05 and daily sf of s psammophila in rainfall category ii p 0 05 compared with daily mean pre rainfall sf daily mean rainfall sf of c korshinskii decreased by 23 8 67 6 and 27 9 in rainfall category i ii and iii respectively corresponding values for s psammophila were 16 7 57 4 and 24 8 respectively the correlation analysis showed that different factors affected the daily rainfall sf between the stands of c korshinskii and s psammophila in the same rainfall category table 4 during the experimental period of time daily rainfall sf at both stands was strongly correlated with daily sr rh and vpd in all three rainfall categories p 0 05 while there was no significant correlation between daily rainfall sf and daily ws for either stand regardless of the rainfall categories p 0 05 the correlation analysis also showed that daily rainfall sf of both c korshinskii and s psammophila was not systematically affected by the rew in the soil profile in the same rainfall category the linear relationships between daily rainfall sf and daily sr rh and vpd for both the c korshinskii and s psammophila stands within different rainfall categories are shown in fig 8 for both stands the relationships between daily rainfall sf and daily sr rh and vpd were different among different rainfall categories as daily sr increased the increases in daily rainfall sf of c korshinskii was stronger than s psammophila in the same rainfall category daily rainfall sf at both c korshinskii and s psammophila decreased increased as daily rh vpd increased in all three rainfall categories 3 3 hourly sf dynamics within different rainfall categories diurnal variations of mean hourly pre rainfall and rainfall sf at both c korshinskii and s psammophila stands within different rainfall categories are shown in fig 9 the pre rainfall hourly sf was systematically higher than the rainfall hourly sf at both c korshinskii and s psammophila stands regardless of the rainfall categories the difference between the hourly pre rainfall and the rainfall sf was the largest in the rainfall category ii at both stands mean hourly pre rainfall sf at both c korshinskii and s psammophila exhibited pronounced diurnal variations within different rainfall categories and the peak values appeared around noon time while for mean hourly rainfall sf no obvious single peak curve could be detected for both stands especially in rainfall category ii fig 9 also shows that total daytime 6 00 to 20 00 local time pre rainfall sf of c korshinskii and s psammophila in three rainfall categories accounted for 92 5 to 95 5 and 89 8 to 92 2 of total whole day pre rainfall sf respectively three incident rainfall days that had similar ra and rd in the same rainfall category were selected to further illustrate hourly sf characteristics of c korshinskii and s psammophila fig 10 rainfall distribution differed amongst these selected days in the same rainfall category the dynamic of sf characteristics at both c korshinskii and s psammophila were sensitive to rainfall distribution among these selected days regardless of the rainfall categories daily total sf of both stands was generally lower when rainfall mainly occurred at daytime amongst these selected days especially in rainfall category ii ranges of hourly sf in each stand also differed among these selected days in the same rainfall category 4 discussion 4 1 correlations between daily sf dynamics and rainfall categories to the best of our knowledge no studies have investigated the correlations between sf dynamics and rainfall categories of dryland shrubs our results found that daily pre rainfall sf was always higher than daily rainfall sf for the two xerophytic shrubs we monitored irrespective of the rainfall categories sf is closely related to not only biological and physiological characteristics but also environmental factors jiao et al 2019 liu et al 2012 nicolás et al 2005 ortuño et al 2006 on typical sunny days sf begins to increase along with the increase of sr and at and the decline of rh this increase in sf may be attributed to the increase of the leaf to air boundary water potential differences huang et al 2010 krauss et al 2007 the occurrence of rainfall events generally increased the air s rh and decreased at and sr and liquid water could also easily induce saturation of leaf surface and crease in leaf turgor zhao and liu 2010 the decrease in sf during rainfall events may be associated with the fact that stomata tends to close with the change in environmental conditions and leaf water status granier et al 1996 irvine et al 1998 maximum decreases in daily sf between the pre rainfall and the rainfall weather condition of the two stands both occurred in rainfall category ii when the canopy is wet evaporative energy is consumed for evaporating the water on the canopy bosveld and bouten 2003 and the water vapor exchange process is determined by wet canopy evaporation rather than dry canopy transpiration kume et al 2006 compared with rainfall categories i and iii rainfall category ii had the highest mean rd biggest daily mean rh and lowest daily mean sr and vpd therefore canopy drying time in rainfall category ii could be the longest and long term stomata closure or reduced opening would restrict the transpiration rate of shrubs yue et al 2008 in the loess plateau the groundwater table is generally lower than 50 m which precludes upward capillary flow into the root zone liu et al 2010 thus precipitation is the main source of water for the growth of shrubs in dryland ecosystems small frequent precipitation events moisten the surface layer of the soil sala and lauenroth 1982 based on the relative influence of atmospheric demand vertical soil moisture was aggregated into the shallow and deep layers where the shallow layer is largely influenced by atmospheric demand sanchez mejia and papuga 2017 cao et al 2011 reported that ra of 1 mm or less had little impact on swc as a result of strong evaporative demand in this region ježík et al 2015 found that large rainfall events are most likely to produce soil moisture recharge at the deep layer to improve the soil water status during the two rainy seasons daily mean swc0 40 cm and rew0 40 cm of each stand was consistently lower in rainfall category i than in rainfall categories ii and iii and this was mainly due to the fact that rainfall category i has the lowest mean ra and relatively stronger evaporative demand among the three rainfall categories the effects of increased soil water on transpiration have not reached consistent conclusions jiao et al 2019 generally water is the limiting factors in dryland ecosystems and a positive feedback could exist between soil moisture and vegetation dynamics d odorico et al 2007 in this study relationships between daily rainfall sf and daily rew at different soil layers differed between the two stands regardless of the rainfall categories the plant s water use pattern varied widely among different root characteristics of species ewers and oren 2000 root distribution characteristics differed between the stands of c korshinskii and s psammophila and the roots of c korshinskii and s psammophila are mainly distributed in 30 90 and 0 60 cm soil layers respectively besides rew also differed between the two stands along the soil profiles amongst all three different rainfall categories these differences in root distribution and daily rew at different soil layers between the two stands would largely account for differences in relationship between daily rainfall sf and daily rew at different soil layers 4 2 correlations between hourly sf dynamics and rainfall categories the mean hourly pre rainfall sf for the c korshinskii were generally single peak curves in all three rainfall categories whereas for the s psammophila the mean hourly pre rainfall sf tended to have double peaks one before and one after the noon local time qi and zhang 2008 found that the diurnal variation of transpiration rate differed between c korshinskii and s psammophila in non rainy days differences in maximum elastic modulus salleo et al 1997 cavitation resistance hacke et al 2001 root system dong and zhang 2001 and middy leaf hydraulic conductance brodribb and holbrook 2004 might exist between c korshinskii and s psammophila and then lead to differences in midday stomatal conductance and diurnal variation of mean hourly pre rainfall sf between the two stands nighttime transpiration of c korshinskii and s psammophila was both relatively small in this study the majority of the pre rainfall and rainfall sf occurred during the daytime in all three rainfall categories thus rainfall events that occurred at nighttime would not significantly decrease daily total sf of each stand in all three rainfall categories in the same rainfall category diurnal variation of hourly sf at both stands differed among the days with similar ra and rd this is likely due to the response of plants to rainfall is intimately correlated with the characteristics of the rainfall events fravolini et al 2005 reynolds et al 2004 while these selected days in the same rainfall category had similar ra and rd meteorological factors such as sr rh and vpd were not the same which are known to lead to differences in canopy drying time and then cause differences in hourly sf dynamics kume et al 2006 pataki and oren 2003 qu et al 2007 the mechanisms of rainfall category and pattern in affecting sf still need further investigation with controlled experiments and modelling approach 4 3 inter specific differences of correlations between shrub sf and rainfall categories the response of daily sf to rainfall events differed at the stands of c korshinskii and s psammophila within the rainfall categories for c korshinskii we found that daily rainfall sf was significantly lower than daily pre rainfall sf in three rainfall categories whereas for s psammophila there were no significantly differences between daily pre rainfall and rainfall sf in rainfall categories i and iii we suggest that daily sf of c korshinskii would be more susceptible to be affected by rainfall events compared with s psammophila as the two shrub stands are relatively close 1 5 km the difference in meteorological factors such as sr vpd rh and rainfall characteristics between the two stands can be ignored compared with s psammophila c korshinskii shrubs have the lanceolate and concave leaf shape upward leaf orientation and densely veined leaf structure which provide a stronger leaf structure support in c korshinskii for the rainfall water intercepted by leaves yuan et al 2017 again these differences in canopy interception might lead to differences in canopy drying time and stomata closure between c korshinskii and s psammophila during and after rainfall besides s psammophila had relatively large leaf and stem xylem conduit diameters dong and zhang 2001 and its leaf and stem level hydraulic transport efficiencies are also higher than c korshinskii li et al 2016 which could largely contribute to differences in decreases in daily pre rainfall and rainfall sf between c korshinskii and s psammophila even in the similar meteorological environment even though both c korshinskii and s psammophila can obtain higher carbon assimilation rate and maintain higher water use efficient to adapt to arid condition the photo inhibition of shrubs occurred at noon was observed for c korshinskii xia and shao 2008 this process would decrease the transpiration rate in the crown and sap flow density in the branches bing et al 2008 therefore we concluded that the occurrence of rainfall events at noon would benefit more to c korshinskii than s psammophila to reduce its high transpiration consumption for living in an arid environment even for the same species the sf may be largely different under different site conditions xia et al 2008 analyzed seasonal variation of sf of 15 year old c korshinskii in the desert region of north west china and found that the mean daily sf was about 3680 g d 1 from 8 may to 16 october 2004 huang et al 2015 found that the average daily sf of s psammophila was about 424 6 g d 1 from 29 may to 13 july 2011 in a semi arid environment in northwest china the above daily mean sf values differed from the measured results of c korshinskii and s psammophila in this study 1575 7 g d 1 and 1207 9 g d 1 respectively the differences were largely caused by differences in climatic conditions and soil characteristics 5 conclusions the results of our study highlight that the two xerophytic shrubs in the loess plateau of china c korshinskii and s psammophila respond differently to rainfall events in their sf characteristics the occurrence of rainfall events significantly decreased daily sf of c korshinskii whereas the sf of s psammophila is more strongly affected by rainfall events with the highest mean rd and moderate mean ra and ri category ii we inferred that daily sf of c korshinskii is more susceptible to rainfall events than s psammophila additionally maximum decreases in daily sf between pre rainfall and rainfall weather conditions both occurred in rainfall category ii for both shrubs a majority of the sf occurred during the daytime for both c korshinskii and s psammophila stands and the impact of nighttime rainfall on the sf is small regardless of the rainfall categories our research also suggested that the role of rainfall category characteristics ra rd and ri other than meteorological factors should be taken into account when assessing the response of sf dynamics of shrubs to rainfall events in arid and semi arid regions it is our next research plan to investigate the mechanisms of rainfall in driving interactions between soil moisture variations and sf responses of xerophytic shrubs

5560,global climate change is likely to change the timing frequency and magnitude of precipitation events studying the response of sap flow sf of plants to rainfall events is thus important for understanding the response of ecosystems to global climate change here we conducted a comprehensive study on the sf rainfall events meteorological factors and soil water content swc for two typical xerophytic shrub stands caragana korshinskii and salix psammophila on the loess plateau of china for two rainy seasons june september in 2015 and 2016 the rainfall events were classified into three rainfall categories using the k means clustering based on the rainfall amount ra rainfall duration rd and rainfall intensity ri category i lowest mean ra rd and ri category ii moderate mean ra ri and highest mean rd and category iii highest mean ra ri and moderate mean rd the results showed that the response of sf at both c korshinskii and s psammophila stands to rainfall events differed within the three categories the occurrence of rainfall events significantly decreased daily sf of c korshinskii in three rainfall categories whereas the daily sf of s psammophila is more strongly influenced by rainfall category ii maximum decreases in daily sf between the pre rainfall and the rainfall weather condition of the two stands both occurred in rainfall category ii daily rainfall sf at both stands was strongly correlated with daily sr rh and vpd regardless of the rainfall categories diurnal variation of hourly sf at both stands also differed among the days with similar ra and rd in the same rainfall category it can be inferred that sf of c korshinskii is more susceptible to rainfall events than s psammophila rainfall characteristics ra rd and ri and rainfall distribution should be fully considered when assessing the response of sf of shrubs to rainfall events keywords sap flow rainfall category inter specific variation xerophytic shrub drylands 1 introduction rainfall is considered a major driver of the distribution and abundance of vegetation in drylands kwarteng et al 2009 and most precipitation events in drylands are small in magnitude 5 mm and short in duration 30 mins cavanaugh et al 2011 in these systems rainfall is the main natural source to recover soil water which provides available water for plant transpiration dymond et al 2017 ungar et al 2013 thus plant productivity is particularly sensitive to precipitation inputs fay 2009 huxman et al 2004 ogle and reynolds 2004 studies have shown that global climate change is expected to increase atmospheric water demand and terrestrial evapotranspiration greve et al 2014 novick et al 2016 which may offset modest increases in precipitation and reduce the soil water availability for vegetation growth allen et al 2015 wu et al 2017 the decline in soil water availability could exert negative impacts on transpiration and result in variations in hydrological cycling dymond et al 2017 therefore it is very essential to investigate the rainfall soil moisture vegetation response interactions under climate change in drylands evapotranspiration generally accounts for more than 95 of the water lost in many dryland ecosystems williams et al 2004 and globally transpiration is about 64 13 of evapotranspiration good et al 2015 sap flow sf is an important indicator of water movement in plants and can be used to indicate the instantaneous transpiration of plants kume et al 2008 steppe et al 2010 zhang et al 2018 zhao et al 2009 global climate change is likely to increase the variability of precipitation patterns zhao and liu 2010 many studies found that climate induced changes in regional precipitation could have important implications for the water cycles of dryland ecosystems wullschleger and hanson 2006 studied the sensitivity of canopy transpiration to altered precipitation in an upland oak forest and found that supplemental precipitation added to the wet plot increased seasonal canopy transpiration of upland oak on average 9 compared with the ambient plot zeppel et al 2008 studied the response of sf to rainfall pulse in a temperate australian woodland and found that the size of rainfall event could significantly affect the response of sf to rainfall du et al 2011 focused on species differences in sf characteristics in response to rainfall pulse and found that rainfall pulses could significantly increase sf of robinia pseudoacacia quercus liaotungensis and armeniaca sibirica thus studying the response of plant sf to changes in timing frequency and magnitude of precipitation events could be important for formulating reasonable water management strategies in dryland ecosystems in the context of global climatic change dunkerley 2009 shrubs are the representative plant functional type in dryland ecosystems yuan et al 2017 in these ecosystems sf is generally monitored using the stem heat balance method in the field naithani et al 2012 vincent et al 2007 a number of studies have examined the dynamics of sf at multiple timescales and or its relationship with influencing factors fisher et al 2007 moran et al 2009 zhao et al 2016 while only few studies have explored the influence of rainfall pulses on sf of dryland shrubs huxman et al 2004 found that redistribution of soil water led to great infiltration and increase in photosynthetic water use of vascular plants following relatively larger pulses or a series of small pulses cavanaugh et al 2011 examined the partitioning of precipitation inputs into soil evaporation and transpiration and found that a series of large precipitation events could increase soil moisture at deep layers and trigger transpiration of larrea tridentata yang et al 2014 studied the physiological characteristic of haloxylon ammodendron to rainfall and argued that the soil water status of h ammodendron is highly sensitive to rainfall pulses and a 6 mm or greater rainfall amount ra is effective precipitation for h ammodendron from the perspective of plant physiology in previous studies rainfall events were usually classified into different rainfall classes based on ra and the influence of rainfall events on shrubs sf and transpiration were then evaluated by directly comparing sf and transpiration amongst different rainfall classes huang and zhang 2016 jian et al 2016 zhao and liu 2010 other rainfall parameters such as rainfall duration rd rainfall intensity ri and changes in the timing and magnitude of rainfall pulses may also affect the activity of plants in dryland ecosystems huxman et al 2004 szutu and papuga 2019 therefore there is a clear need for a comprehensive analysis of the response of sf dynamics of shrubs to rainfall characteristics in this study we measured ra rd a suite of meteorological factors soil water content swc and sf of two xerophytic shrub species caragana korshinskii and salix psammophila on the loess plateau in northern china for two rainy seasons in 2015 and 2016 june september the rainfall events were classified into different rainfall categories based on ra rd and ri the objectives were to investigate 1 daily pre rainfall and rainfall sf of c korshinskii and s psammophila within different rainfall categories 2 relationships between daily sf and influencing factors within different rainfall categories and 3 correlations between daily and hourly sf dynamics with rainfall categories 2 materials and methods 2 1 study site the study area is located in the liudaogou catchment 110 21 110 23 e 38 46 38 51 n 1274 m a s l of shenmu county shaanxi province china fig 1 a the catchment has an area of 6 89 km2 and belongs to the transitional zone between the loess plateau and the mu us desert this region has a moderate temperate continental climate and the average annual rainfall is about 437 mm 1971 2013 the precipitation is concentrated in july to september a period which accounts for 70 of the annual rainfall the mean annual temperature is 8 4 c ranging from 9 7 c in january to 23 7 c in july and the mean annual reference evapotranspiration calculated by the penman monteith equation is 1200 mm liu and shao 2014 the groundwater table in the study area is more than 20 m below the surface and precipitation is the most important available water resource for local ecosystem soils in the study area are mostly sandy loess and sand most of the natural vegetation in the watershed has been disturbed due to long term human activities in recent decades the ecological restoration has been carried out by planting arid land perennial native shrubs such as s psammophila and c korshinskii in this study we selected two representative experimental stands of c korshinskii and s psammophila in the southwest corner of the liudaogou catchment fig 1a c korshinskii usually grows to 2 m height and has pinnate compound leaves in an opposite or sub opposite arrangement in comparison s psammophila usually grows to 3 4 m height and has an odd number of strip shaped leaves yuan et al 2017 both c korshinskii and s psammophila have inverted cone canopy and no trunk with multiple branches running obliquely from the base these two shrubs species were planted approximately 22 years ago and more detailed information for the two selected stands can be found in a previous study yuan et al 2017 2 2 sap flow measurements we measured the sf of c korshinskii and s psammophila during the rainy seasons from june to september in 2015 and 2016 sap flow gauges flow 32 dynamic inc houston tx usa which are based on the energy balance method were used to measure sf in the stems fig 1b the main criteria to select stem for sap flow measurements was stem diameter before the gauges were set up diameters of 180 and 261 stems of four shrubs in the c korshinskii and s psammophila stands respectively were measured to determine the mean and range of stem diameters in each stand rana et al 2005 a total of 14 gauges were deployed to measure sf in the two selected stands during the study periods in each year for c korshinskii sf was measured in six stems using six gauges in total including two gauges of each model for 13 mm sga13 and 19 mm sgb19 one gauge of each model for 16 mm sgb16 and 25 mm sgb25 for s psammophila eight stems were monitored using a 9 mm sga9 13 mm sga13 19 mm sgb19 and 25 mm sgb25 and two of each model for 10 mm sga10 and 16 mm sgb16 diameters of these selected stems ranged from 14 5 to 26 4 mm and from 8 8 to 32 1 mm which covered more than 91 and 93 of stem diameter ranges in the c korshinskii and s psammophila stands respectively thus these measured stem could reflect the sf characteristics in the stands diameter and cross sectional area of these selected stems to measure sf in the two stands are shown in table 1 the selected fourteen stems were in good condition and well developed to support the weight of the gauge and survived throughout the study period we carefully installed the gauges according to the instructions recommend by the manufacturer we smoothed these selected stems to remove any superficial bark roughness using a razor blade and attached gauges to the stem as least 40 cm above the soil surface to reduce solar heating each gauge was protected from the weather using a shield wrapping of several layers of aluminum foil after the installation of the sensor heater input voltage of gauges was monitored and adjusted based on the sensor voltage requirements assuming a steady state condition for stem temperature during a small time interval sf g s 1 can be quantified using the following equation baker and bavel 1987 kigalu 2007 1 sf p in q cd q r q s c w t d t u where pin is the heater power input w qcd is the heat conduction loss along the stem up and down stream heat lost w qr is the radial heat conduction loess w qs is the heat stored in the stem section w cw is the specific heat of water j g 1 k 1 td k and tu k are the stem temperatures measured at defined distances downstream and upstream from the heater respectively the signals output from the gauges were recorded at 10 s intervals and stored as 30 min averages using a cr1000 data logger campbell scientific logan usa 2 3 meteorology and soil water content measurements in each selected experimental stand a tipping bucket rainfall gauge rg3 m onset computer corp bourne ma usa 0 2 mm per tip was installed to record the incident precipitation depth and timing three standard rain gauges inner diameter 20 cm were placed around in each rg3 m rainfall gauge to adjust the precipitation amount as an inherent underestimation of automatic precipitation recording groisman and legates 1994 rainfall characteristics such as ra mm rd h and ri mm h 1 could be obtained accordingly the characteristics of the rainfall events ra rd and ri are shown in fig 2 during the rainy seasons rainfall events were recorded on 46 and 41 days in 2015 and 2016 respectively the total precipitation in the rainy season of 2015 was 204 8 mm with the longest rd of 16 h whereas the total precipitation in the rainy season of 2016 was 382 mm with the longest rd of 11 h despite the overall wet rainy season in 2016 the highest ri of 12 8 mm h 1 occurred on august 9th 2015 considering the effects of gully micro geomorphology we also installed a meteorological station in each experimental stand to measure meteorological factors such as air temperature at c and relative humidity rh at a height of 1 5 m from the ground model hmp 155 vaisala helsinki finland solar radiation sr w m 2 model cnr 4 kipp zonen b v delft the netherlands and wind speed ws m s 1 at a height of 2 m from the ground model 03002 r m young company traverse city michigan usa the data were recorded every 5 min using a cr1000 datalogger campbell scientific logan usa and then stored as the 30 min mean data during the study periods vapor pressure deficit vpd kpa was calculated with at and rh according to the method of campbell and norman 1998 in each study plot we monitored the volumetric soil water content swc m3 m 3 along two replicate profiles within and between the canopy using the ec 5 soil moisture probes decagon devices inc pullman wa usa buried at eight depths below the soil surface 10 20 40 60 80 120 160 and 200 cm the data were recorded at 30 min intervals with a hobo logger h21 onset computer corp bourne ma usa the monitored soil water content data was calibrated and corrected against the gravimetric method soil relative extractable water rew of each stand was calculated as follows granier 1987 2 rew swc s w c wp sw c fc s w c wp where swcwp and swcfc are the soil wilting point and field capacity respectively and these values were derived from the soil water characteristic curve an rew of 0 4 was considered to be the threshold of soil water deficits during the study periods chirino et al 2011 2 4 rainfall categories the rainfall events were classified into different rainfall categories using a non hierarchical clustering method the non hierarchical approach requires a priori concept about the numbers of clusters hair et al 1998 in this study the 87 rainfall events during the two rainy seasons were classified into three rainfall categories based on ra rd and ri using the k means clustering table 2 starting from these cluster centres the rainfall events are selected into the three clusters in the way that keeps the overall within group variance at a minimum various distance measures such as euclidean distance hamming distance and minkowski distance can be used to quantify the similarity or the differences among the rainfall events to be classified horváth 2002 attempts were made until the most suitable clusters appeared and normally and the classification must meet the one way analysis of variance anova criterion of significant level p 0 05 wei et al 2007 as shown in table 2 rainfall category i has the lowest values of mean ra rd and

category iii has the highest mean ra moderate mean rd and highest mean ri 16 5 15 7 mm 4 1 2 6 h and 4 0 2 7 mm h 1 respectively during the two rainy seasons rainfall events had the frequent occurrence of 48 3 for rainfall category i followed by 28 7 for rainfall category ii and 22 9 for rainfall category iii table 2 2 5 statistical analysis the hourly sf was calculated as the average output of sap in one hour for these selected stems daily sf of each stand was the sum of hourly sf in a day summary statistics such as means standard deviation and variation coefficient of ra rd ri sf meteorological factors swc and rew within different rainfall categories were calculated anova was performed to evaluate the statistical differences of daily meteorological factors swc and rew at different soil layers amongst the three rainfall categories the statistical differences of daily pre rainfall and rainfall sf among different rainfall categories were also evaluated the pearson correlation analysis was used to test the significance of the relationship of sf with influencing factors at daily scales the level of significance was set at 95 confidence interval p 0 05 all statistical analyses were performed with spss 16 0 spss inc usa 3 results 3 1 meteorology and soil water content the temporal variation of daily sr at rh ws and vpd during the june september rainy seasons in 2015 and 2016 are shown in fig 3 there were no noticeable differences in daily sr at rh ws and vpd between the stand of c korshinskii and s psammophila p 0 05 daily sr at rh ws and vpd showed obvious seasonal variations during the experimental period of each year daily sr at rh ws and vpd during the study periods in 2015 and 2016 were from 18 9 to 363 2 and 13 6 353 1 w m 2 9 4 27 7

category i and lowest in category ii p 0 05 while for daily mean ws no significant differences could be detected within different rainfall categories p 0 05 daily mean sr and at were significantly lower in rainfall category ii than in categories i and iii p 0 05 and daily mean rh was lower in rainfall category i than in categories ii and iii p 0 05 during the experimental period of time daily swc and rew of c korshinskii and s psammophila showed different patterns along the soil profile fig 4 while the top 40 cm of the soil was more responsive to precipitation the lower soil layers fluctuated little during the rainy seasons particularly for c korshinskii swc at the s psammophila however fluctuated strongly even to the depth of 120 200 cm daily swc0 40 cm and swc120 200 cm of c korshinskii ranged from 0 13 0 28 m3 m 3 and 0 16 0 18 m3 m 3 respectively during the two rainy seasons while for s psammophila corresponding values were from 0 03 to 0 11 m3 m 3 and 0 04 to 0 14 m3 m

deficit was detected at all three soil layers the mean daily swc0 40 cm and rew0 40 cm of both stands were significantly higher in rainfall categories ii and iii than in rainfall category i p 0 05 while at the 40 120 cm and 120 200 cm soil layers no significant differences could be detected in daily mean swc and rew of either stand among different rainfall categories p 0 05 fig 5 the mean daily swc and rew of c korshinskii were consistently higher than s psammophila regardless of the soil layers and rainfall categories p 0 05 3 2 daily sf dynamics within different rainfall categories daily rainfall sf were classified according to the rainfall category for both c korshinskii and s psammophila during the experimental period of time fig 6 there were 38 22 and 19 daily sf data in rainfall category i ii and iii during the study period respectively daily rainfall sf of c korshinskii ranged from 311 2 to 2730 5 g d 1 from 65 6 to 1999 4 g d 1 and from 50 8 to 2756 9 g d 1 in rainfall category i ii and iii respectively while for s psammophila corresponding range values were 251 2 2753 4 g d 1 132 6 1414 2 g d 1 and 85 1 2698 4 g d 1 respectively daily rainfall sf measured at both c korshinskii and s psammophila stands were notably higher in summer 2015 than that of 2016 in rainfall categories i and iii there was no obvious trend in relationship between daily rainfall sf of c korshinskii and s psammophila in the same rainfall category for both c korshinskii and s psammophila stands no significant difference in mean daily pre rainfall sf among different rainfall categories was observed p 0 05 while the mean daily rainfall sf was significantly lower in rainfall category ii than in rainfall categories i and iii p 0 05 fig 7 daily mean pre rainfall sf of c korshinskii and s psammophila was 2048 1 599 3 and 1536 9 727 9 g d 1 1783 9 692 9 and 1243 9 492 9 g d 1 and 1832 3 557 3 and 1344 3 673 2 g d 1 in rainfall category i ii and iii respectively the occurrence of rainfall events significantly reduced daily sf of c korshinskii in three rainfall categories p 0 05 and daily sf of s psammophila in rainfall category ii p 0 05 compared with daily mean pre rainfall sf daily mean rainfall sf of c korshinskii decreased by 23 8 67 6 and 27 9 in rainfall category i ii and iii respectively corresponding values for s psammophila were 16 7 57 4 and 24 8 respectively the correlation analysis showed that different factors affected the daily rainfall sf between the stands of c korshinskii and s psammophila in the same rainfall category table 4 during the experimental period of time daily rainfall sf at both stands was strongly correlated with daily sr rh and vpd in all three rainfall categories p 0 05 while there was no significant correlation between daily rainfall sf and daily ws for either stand regardless of the rainfall categories p 0 05 the correlation analysis also showed that daily rainfall sf of both c korshinskii and s psammophila was not systematically affected by the rew in the soil profile in the same rainfall category the linear relationships between daily rainfall sf and daily sr rh and vpd for both the c korshinskii and s psammophila stands within different rainfall categories are shown in fig 8 for both stands the relationships between daily rainfall sf and daily sr rh and vpd were different among different rainfall categories as daily sr increased the increases in daily rainfall sf of c korshinskii was stronger than s psammophila in the same rainfall category daily rainfall sf at both c korshinskii and s psammophila decreased increased as daily rh vpd increased in all three rainfall categories 3 3 hourly sf dynamics within different rainfall categories diurnal variations of mean hourly pre rainfall and rainfall sf at both c korshinskii and s psammophila stands within different rainfall categories are shown in fig 9 the pre rainfall hourly sf was systematically higher than the rainfall hourly sf at both c korshinskii and s psammophila stands regardless of the rainfall categories the difference between the hourly pre rainfall and the rainfall sf was the largest in the rainfall category ii at both stands mean hourly pre rainfall sf at both c korshinskii and s psammophila exhibited pronounced diurnal variations within different rainfall categories and the peak values appeared around noon time while for mean hourly rainfall sf no obvious single peak curve could be detected for both stands especially in rainfall category ii fig 9 also shows that total daytime 6 00 to 20 00 local time pre rainfall sf of c korshinskii and s psammophila in three rainfall categories accounted for 92 5 to 95 5 and 89 8 to 92 2 of total whole day pre rainfall sf respectively three incident rainfall days that had similar ra and rd in the same rainfall category were selected to further illustrate hourly sf characteristics of c korshinskii and s psammophila fig 10 rainfall distribution differed amongst these selected days in the same rainfall category the dynamic of sf characteristics at both c korshinskii and s psammophila were sensitive to rainfall distribution among these selected days regardless of the rainfall categories daily total sf of both stands was generally lower when rainfall mainly occurred at daytime amongst these selected days especially in rainfall category ii ranges of hourly sf in each stand also differed among these selected days in the same rainfall category 4 discussion 4 1 correlations between daily sf dynamics and rainfall categories to the best of our knowledge no studies have investigated the correlations between sf dynamics and rainfall categories of dryland shrubs our results found that daily pre rainfall sf was always higher than daily rainfall sf for the two xerophytic shrubs we monitored irrespective of the rainfall categories sf is closely related to not only biological and physiological characteristics but also environmental factors jiao et al 2019 liu et al 2012 nicolás et al 2005 ortuño et al 2006 on typical sunny days sf begins to increase along with the increase of sr and at and the decline of rh this increase in sf may be attributed to the increase of the leaf to air boundary water potential differences huang et al 2010 krauss et al 2007 the occurrence of rainfall events generally increased the air s rh and decreased at and sr and liquid water could also easily induce saturation of leaf surface and crease in leaf turgor zhao and liu 2010 the decrease in sf during rainfall events may be associated with the fact that stomata tends to close with the change in environmental conditions and leaf water status granier et al 1996 irvine et al 1998 maximum decreases in daily sf between the pre rainfall and the rainfall weather condition of the two stands both occurred in rainfall category ii when the canopy is wet evaporative energy is consumed for evaporating the water on the canopy bosveld and bouten 2003 and the water vapor exchange process is determined by wet canopy evaporation rather than dry canopy transpiration kume et al 2006 compared with rainfall categories i and iii rainfall category ii had the highest mean rd biggest daily mean rh and lowest daily mean sr and vpd therefore canopy drying time in rainfall category ii could be the longest and long term stomata closure or reduced opening would restrict the transpiration rate of shrubs yue et al 2008 in the loess plateau the groundwater table is generally lower than 50 m which precludes upward capillary flow into the root zone liu et al 2010 thus precipitation is the main source of water for the growth of shrubs in dryland ecosystems small frequent precipitation events moisten the surface layer of the soil sala and lauenroth 1982 based on the relative influence of atmospheric demand vertical soil moisture was aggregated into the shallow and deep layers where the shallow layer is largely influenced by atmospheric demand sanchez mejia and papuga 2017 cao et al 2011 reported that ra of 1 mm or less had little impact on swc as a result of strong evaporative demand in this region ježík et al 2015 found that large rainfall events are most likely to produce soil moisture recharge at the deep layer to improve the soil water status during the two rainy seasons daily mean swc0 40 cm and rew0 40 cm of each stand was consistently lower in rainfall category i than in rainfall categories ii and iii and this was mainly due to the fact that rainfall category i has the lowest mean ra and relatively stronger evaporative demand among the three rainfall categories the effects of increased soil water on transpiration have not reached consistent conclusions jiao et al 2019 generally water is the limiting factors in dryland ecosystems and a positive feedback could exist between soil moisture and vegetation dynamics d odorico et al 2007 in this study relationships between daily rainfall sf and daily rew at different soil layers differed between the two stands regardless of the rainfall categories the plant s water use pattern varied widely among different root characteristics of species ewers and oren 2000 root distribution characteristics differed between the stands of c korshinskii and s psammophila and the roots of c korshinskii and s psammophila are mainly distributed in 30 90 and 0 60 cm soil layers respectively besides rew also differed between the two stands along the soil profiles amongst all three different rainfall categories these differences in root distribution and daily rew at different soil layers between the two stands would largely account for differences in relationship between daily rainfall sf and daily rew at different soil layers 4 2 correlations between hourly sf dynamics and rainfall categories the mean hourly pre rainfall sf for the c korshinskii were generally single peak curves in all three rainfall categories whereas for the s psammophila the mean hourly pre rainfall sf tended to have double peaks one before and one after the noon local time qi and zhang 2008 found that the diurnal variation of transpiration rate differed between c korshinskii and s psammophila in non rainy days differences in maximum elastic modulus salleo et al 1997 cavitation resistance hacke et al 2001 root system dong and zhang 2001 and middy leaf hydraulic conductance brodribb and holbrook 2004 might exist between c korshinskii and s psammophila and then lead to differences in midday stomatal conductance and diurnal variation of mean hourly pre rainfall sf between the two stands nighttime transpiration of c korshinskii and s psammophila was both relatively small in this study the majority of the pre rainfall and rainfall sf occurred during the daytime in all three rainfall categories thus rainfall events that occurred at nighttime would not significantly decrease daily total sf of each stand in all three rainfall categories in the same rainfall category diurnal variation of hourly sf at both stands differed among the days with similar ra and rd this is likely due to the response of plants to rainfall is intimately correlated with the characteristics of the rainfall events fravolini et al 2005 reynolds et al 2004 while these selected days in the same rainfall category had similar ra and rd meteorological factors such as sr rh and vpd were not the same which are known to lead to differences in canopy drying time and then cause differences in hourly sf dynamics kume et al 2006 pataki and oren 2003 qu et al 2007 the mechanisms of rainfall category and pattern in affecting sf still need further investigation with controlled experiments and modelling approach 4 3 inter specific differences of correlations between shrub sf and rainfall categories the response of daily sf to rainfall events differed at the stands of c korshinskii and s psammophila within the rainfall categories for c korshinskii we found that daily rainfall sf was significantly lower than daily pre rainfall sf in three rainfall categories whereas for s psammophila there were no significantly differences between daily pre rainfall and rainfall sf in rainfall categories i and iii we suggest that daily sf of c korshinskii would be more susceptible to be affected by rainfall events compared with s psammophila as the two shrub stands are relatively close 1 5 km the difference in meteorological factors such as sr vpd rh and rainfall characteristics between the two stands can be ignored compared with s psammophila c korshinskii shrubs have the lanceolate and concave leaf shape upward leaf orientation and densely veined leaf structure which provide a stronger leaf structure support in c korshinskii for the rainfall water intercepted by leaves yuan et al 2017 again these differences in canopy interception might lead to differences in canopy drying time and stomata closure between c korshinskii and s psammophila during and after rainfall besides s psammophila had relatively large leaf and stem xylem conduit diameters dong and zhang 2001 and its leaf and stem level hydraulic transport efficiencies are also higher than c korshinskii li et al 2016 which could largely contribute to differences in decreases in daily pre rainfall and rainfall sf between c korshinskii and s psammophila even in the similar meteorological environment even though both c korshinskii and s psammophila can obtain higher carbon assimilation rate and maintain higher water use efficient to adapt to arid condition the photo inhibition of shrubs occurred at noon was observed for c korshinskii xia and shao 2008 this process would decrease the transpiration rate in the crown and sap flow density in the branches bing et al 2008 therefore we concluded that the occurrence of rainfall events at noon would benefit more to c korshinskii than s psammophila to reduce its high transpiration consumption for living in an arid environment even for the same species the sf may be largely different under different site conditions xia et al 2008 analyzed seasonal variation of sf of 15 year old c korshinskii in the desert region of north west china and found that the mean daily sf was about 3680 g d 1 from 8 may to 16 october 2004 huang et al 2015 found that the average daily sf of s psammophila was about 424 6 g d 1 from 29 may to 13 july 2011 in a semi arid environment in northwest china the above daily mean sf values differed from the measured results of c korshinskii and s psammophila in this study 1575 7 g d 1 and 1207 9 g d 1 respectively the differences were largely caused by differences in climatic conditions and soil characteristics 5 conclusions the results of our study highlight that the two xerophytic shrubs in the loess plateau of china c korshinskii and s psammophila respond differently to rainfall events in their sf characteristics the occurrence of rainfall events significantly decreased daily sf of c korshinskii whereas the sf of s psammophila is more strongly affected by rainfall events with the highest mean rd and moderate mean ra and ri category ii we inferred that daily sf of c korshinskii is more susceptible to rainfall events than s psammophila additionally maximum decreases in daily sf between pre rainfall and rainfall weather conditions both occurred in rainfall category ii for both shrubs a majority of the sf occurred during the daytime for both c korshinskii and s psammophila stands and the impact of nighttime rainfall on the sf is small regardless of the rainfall categories our research also suggested that the role of rainfall category characteristics ra rd and ri other than meteorological factors should be taken into account when assessing the response of sf dynamics of shrubs to rainfall events in arid and semi arid regions it is our next research plan to investigate the mechanisms of rainfall in driving interactions between soil moisture variations and sf responses of xerophytic shrubs

this manuscript was handled by marco borga editor in chief with the assistance of christian massari associate editor graphical abstract controlling runoff generation and soil loss from hillslopes is a priority for land management the capability of cyanobacteria as inoculants has recently been utilized in land management and as a result various lab scale studies have been conducted the present study conducted a field pilot experiment in miandoab city south of west azerbaijan province north west iran to evaluate the success of cyanobacteria inoculation in runoff and sediment reduction from an abandoned and degraded land at large plot scale under natural rainfall on 26 december 2017 the cultured native cyanobacteria nostoc sp and oscillatoria sp was inoculated on the 22 1 1 83 m2 plot in three replicates along with three control plots treated by pure water the runoff and soil loss from the treated plots were measured for seven rainfall events that produced runoff during normal rainy season of the study area i e december 2017 to may 2018 results showed that inoculation of cyanobacteria significantly p 0 05 decreased runoff by some 35 25 31 33 46 47 and 57 for the recorded rainfall events 1 to 7 respectively the beneficial reduction of sediment concentration due to the inoculation of cyanobacteria was also observed for rainfall events 1 2 3 and 5 at the respective tune of 16 34 36 and 135 compared to those of control plots soil cracks indicators roughness and aggregate stability were also improved by 5 1 to 27 14 to 20 and 13 to 22 respectively owing to the inoculation of cyanobacteria although vegetation cover at the end of experiment was 2 6 times denser than that in the beginning there was no significant difference between inoculated and control plots by and large field inoculation of cyanobacteria was found as an efficient technique for runoff and soil loss inhibition particularly in degraded and abandoned drylands keywords biological control

deposition of sediment have great on site e g soil loss threatening food security and socio economic collapse kheirfam et al 2017b tian et al 2018 and off site e g eutrophication in water bodies aquatic animal health threat clogging of river beds and destruction of urban and industrial infrastructure borrelli et al 2018 consequences to alleviate this problem integrated approach to runoff and sediment generationfrom the beginning to the end particularly in degradation prone landscapes is crucial to that end inhibiting runoff generation and soil loss at the early stages is regarded as the best management practice kheirfam et al 2017b leading to more sustainable ecosystem with higher efficiency and lower cost soil particle detachment by raindrops splash erosion from hillslopes is the first step of the soil degradation process especially in abandoned drylands where the soil surface is bare and consequently runoff generation and sediment concentration are high van loo et al 2017 anache et al 2018 during rainfall and or erosive rainfall events however improving the physical chemical and biological properties of the soil surface is a way to conserve bare hillslopes against raindrop impacts and then balancing runoff volume and decreasing sediment concentration martínez hernández et al 2017 sadeghi et al 2017 to this end various bio and non bio based strategies like

2017 have been applied to improve soil properties to withstand the erosive force of rainfall and runoff besides these techniques the inoculation of cyanobacteria on soil through the hydro seeding technique has been recently introduced as a bio live based amendment to restore degraded lands at laboratory scale kheirfam et al 2017a and b sadeghi et al 2017 chamizo et al 2018 muñoz rojas et al 2018b and in the field under moisture supplying conditions wang et al 2009 colica et al 2014 among cyanobacteria strains the genus of nostoc oscillatoria lyngbya anabaena scytonema tolypothrix scytonema phormidium microcoleus cylindrospermum has been widely usedas a soil inoculant e g acea et al 2003 nisha et al 2007 wang et al 2009 aboal et al 2016 lababpour and kaviani 2016 kheirfam et al 2017a b park et al 2017 sadeghi et al 2017 chamizo et al 2018 muñoz rojas et al 2018a b román et al 2018 however there seems no report on using cyanobacteria inoculant at the field plots and or hillslope scale without any moisture supplying and controlling environmental condition cyanobacteria are microscopic photo autotrophic prokaryotic organisms that can be intensively found in the biological soil crusts bscs bowker et al 2010 cyanobacteria can increase soil aggregation and stability costa et al 2018 facilitate changing soil micro structures to macro structures colica et al 2014 kheirfam et al 2017b reclaim fertility kheirfam et al 2017a create vertical micro channels in the soil surface sadeghi et al 2017 improve water retaining capacity of soil adessi et al 2018 through both excrete exopolysaccharides and develop filaments rossi et al 2017 chamizo et al 2018 these lead to improving soil water infiltration and soil particle resistance and thus decrease soil loss and balance runoff behavior although cyanobacteria are present in most environments belnap et al 2013 their role is much more prominent in low and non vegetated lands especially abandoned drylands where the soil is unprotected against raindrop blows the ability of cyanobacteria as dominant members of dryland bscs in degraded lands has been thwarted because of notable removal of surface soil by erosive factors wind and or water erosion additionally in the newly abandoned lands bscs are also less developed as described above rehabilitation of their bscs by the cyanobacteria inoculation technique has been proved as a bio tool and eco friendly measure to restore dry and abandoned lands against intensive runoff generation and high soil loss kheirfam et al 2017a b sadeghi et al 2017 rossi et al 2017 chamizo et al 2018 muñoz rojas et al 2018b however it is still not quite clear whether this technique will be successful in a completely natural condition and without any support this current study therefore has been formulated to evaluate the effectiveness of native cyanobacteria inoculation on balancing runoff volume and sediment concentration this initiative was actualized at a large plot scale installed in an abandoned land in a semiarid region of nw iran for natural rains occurred from december 2017 to may 2018 in addition some soil surface physical characteristics viz soil cracks roughness aggregate stability and particle arrangement and also variation in vegetation cover were measured and then analyzed during the experiment period to appropriately discuss the findings 2 materials and methods 2 1 site description and soil sampling in order to assess the effects of cyanobacteria inoculation on soil and water conservation three universal soil loss equation usle based standard plots 22 1 1 83 m were established in december 2017 on an abandoned agricultural land hillslope 25 15 km south west of miandoab south of west azerbaijan province north west iran 40 35 to37 28 e longitude and 45 45 to 47 23 n latitude elevation is 1300 m a m s l the runoff and sediment from the area including the study site flow to the reservoir of a 14 mcm diversion norouzlo dam constructed on zarinerood river for supplying drinking water as well as irrigation mean annual precipitation of the study area is about 254 mm distributed in winter autumn spring and summer as 35 06 32 27 29 99 and 2 68 respectively the minimum mean and maximum annual temperatures are 6 9 11 4 and 32 5 c respectively and the coolest and hottest months are january 0 c and august 22 8 c respectively some 97 freezing days october to march have also been recorded in a year for the region the area has been mainly covered by peganum harmala and poa bulbosa with less than 3 and 10 cover density respectively the general location of the study area is shown in fig 1 the native cyanobacteria from the study site were used for the study soil samples were collected from the upper 5 cm of the soil layer chamizo et al 2012a of hillslope in august 2017 dry season the samples were taken to the soil and microbiology laboratories at the urmia lake research institute urmia university urmia iran and air dried and then sieved to 2 mm chamizo et al 2012b for using in cyanobacteria culturing processes 2 2 cyanobacteria culturing first the cyanobacteria from the soil microorganism bank were cultured by bg11 and chu10 media in 8 cm petri dishes as solid phase at 25 to 28 c under box cutler environment for 14 10 h light dark cycles andersen 2005 the isolated cyanobacteria were then transferred to the liquid phase of the media afterwards the cyanobacteria were identified based on standard protocols bergey and breed 1957 komárek 2006 whitton and potts 2012 the soil cyanobacteria were identified at the genus level using the morphological based methods with the help of high resolution microscope due to their good performance komárek et al 2014 and the inaccessibility to molecular identification method an introductory microscopic study was also conducted towards this soil samples were placed in sterile petri dishes covered with sterile cover slips moistened with sterile water and incubated in the incubation chamber the cover slips were then removed and actively growing algae was examined under the microscope komárek and anagnostidis 1998 komárek 2013 among the representatives of blue green algae nostoc punctiforme and lyngbya martensiana were the most common species found in all soil samples then nostoc sp and oscillatoria sp were eventually selected based on their broad presence in the samples aboal et al 2016 and successful results for similar studies under lab conditions in the previous studies kheirfam et al 2017a b sadeghi et al 2017 based on the procedures reported by buchanan and gibbons 1974 komárek 2006 and whitton and potts 2012 the selected cyanobacteria were continuously proliferated with a constant input of sterile air until a biomass concentration of 1010 cfu 2 11 g of dry weight per liter was achieved kheirfam et al 2017a and b sadeghi et al 2017 finally 61 l of cyanobacteria inoculum was prepared for treating study plots the cyanobacteria of the study soil were also extracted from the control and inoculated plots and cultured again at the start and the end of the experiment period with the same procedure to compare the abundance of cyanobacteria so 20 ml liquid sample of the extracted cyanobacteria from each plot was taken at the beginning and after 30 days of experiment and centrifuged 8000 rpm for 15 min at 4 c to collect cyanobacteria cells ansari and fatma 2016 the collected cyanobacteria cells were freeze died and then weighted 2 3 field plot installation and inoculation a total of six galvanized steel erosion plots 22 1 1 83 m2 were installed in the middle of a uniform hillslope with a mean slope from 25 to 30 in the late autumn of 2017 additionally a 200 liter tank was established at the lower end of each plot to collect runoff and washed soils during rainfall events mohamadi and kavian 2015 afterwards we directly inoculated 500 ml m 2 0 526 g m 2 of cyanobacteria on the soil surface of all three plots using backpack sprayer wang et al 2009 as cyanobacteria inoculated treatment along with this 500 ml m 2 of pure water was sprayed on the control plots to create the same moisture conditions for both treatments kheirfam et al 2017a 2 4 rainfall runoff and sediment measurements overall 46 different rainfall events were reported for the study area during 26 december 2017 inoculation day and 24 may 2018 end of experiment out of which seven generating runoff and erosive rainfall runoff events were recorded after each rainfall the volume of the collected runoff in each tank from the two study treatments was measured mohamadi and kavian 2015 next the runoff laden sediment of tank contents was mixed thoroughly polyakov and lal 2008 and 1 l samples were taken to determine the sediment concentration from each plot the collected samples were allowed to settle for some 48 h and clear supernatant was decanted from the containers and the residuals were finally oven dried at 105 c for 24 h mohammadi et al 2018 the properties of rainfall events were analyzed with the help of rainfall hyetographs collected for the meteorological station in the vicinity 300 m of the study site as summarized in table 1 2 5 soil surface property measurements cracks roughness soil aggregate stability and soil particles bound on the upper surface of soil were studied in the current research since such important physical properties of the soil appreciably influence the soil performance in the generation of runoff and soil loss shit et al 2015 luna et al 2018 to determine soil surface cracks sscs and roughness three images 331 339 pixels were taken using a digital camera 12 megapixel canon xc10 hd camcorder japan under moderate light condition from 10 cm above and perpendicular to each plot surface bauer and strauss 2014 after five days of each rainfall event the pores particles and cracks analysis system pcas professional software liu et al 2011 was used to identify and quantify sscs the images were preprocessed and segmented in accordance with the method proposed by liu et al 2013 then the various characteristics of sscs patterns such as node and crack numbers length width perimeter direction and area of each ssc were calculated automatically by the pcas software the entire process of the proposed methodology for a study sample is presented in fig 2 afterwards the density of sscs dc the area weighted mean ratio of sscs area to perimeter awmarp and the area weighted mean of crack fractal dimension awmfrac as sscs morphological complexity indicators and the sscs morphological connectivity r were calculated by eqs 1 novak 1999 2 and 3 xiong et al 2009 and 4 xiong et al 2010 respectively 1 d c i 1 n a c a c 100 2 awmarp i 1 m j j 1 n a cij p cij a cij a c 3 awmfrac i 1 m j 1 n 2 l n 0 25 p cij ln a cij a cij a c ã n 4 r l 3 v 2 where ac ac p n l and v are the sum of all soil crack areas in the typical cracked soil in mm2 the total surface area of the typical cracked soil in mm2 the cracks perimeter in mm number of observation the number of connected cracks and the number of crack nodes the dc awmarp awmfrac and r vary between 0 and 100 0 to 100 1 to 2 and 0 to 1 respectively to quantify the soil surface roughness ssr the three dimensional 3d surface plots were produced for the images with the help of the scanningprobeimageprocessor spiptm image metrology denmark software as a standard program for processing three dimensional surface topography data ihalainen et al 2011 ssr of the inoculated and control plots was quantified before and after each rainfall event furthermore the soil aggregate stability sas of the surface soil was also measured at the start and the end of the experiment to this end after wet sieving of soil samples mesh sizes of 2 1 0 5 and 0 25 mm kemper and rosenau 1986 the mean weighted diameter indicator eq 5 was used to determine aggregate sizes of the soils complied with methodologies suggested by sun et al 2017 5 m w d i 1 n x i w i where mwd x i wi are the mean weighted diameter mm the mean diameter of any particular size range of aggregates separated through sieving mm and the weight of aggregates in that size range as a fraction of the total dry weight of soil used respectively the light optical microscopy lom and scanning electron microscopy sem images were further taken from treated soils at the end of experiment to show the association of soil particles using high resolution optical microscopes olympus ix70 inverted fluorescent microscope tokyo japan and philips xl30 esem amsterdam the netherlands respectively the soil samples were taken from 12 points of each treatment four random samples for each plot and then were thoroughly mixed and finally 1 g soil samples were used for microscopic evaluation of each treated soil 2 6 vegetation cover variation assessment the general situation of vegetation cover was also assessed in the study since runoff and soil loss from hillslopes are also influenced by vegetation in addition to rainfall characteristics and soil properties casermeiro et al 2004 in this regard the vegetation cover variation and development on the study plots were measured three times at the beginning 26 dec 2017 intermediate 25 mar 2018 and end 23 may 2018 of the experimental period for each plot the vegetation cover area was calculated by measuring the crown diameter of plant the height of each plant was also directly measured by the ruler afterwards the total area of vegetation cover ta index liu et al 2018 was used to measure vegetation cover area of each plot finally the ta indices were comparatively analyzed in both inoculated and control treatments to determine the role of vegetation cover on runoff and soil loss from the plots 2 7 environmental impacts and economical assessment the environmental concern of the study treatment was also superficially considered using blooming concept of cyanobacteria manubolu et al 2018 to be informed of the amount and possible blooms of cyanobacteria washed from the plots a 1 l sample was collected from each runoff and sediment tank after each rainfall event the samples were then kept at the room temperature light 25 c 14 10 h light dark cycles for giving three month time to grow the washed cyanobacteria from the plots to this end visual inspection and optical microscopic monitoring were regularly used since the economic valuation of runoff and sediment controlling techniques need complex methods we only made a comparative study with other methods widely applied for soil and water conservation throughout iran 2 8 statistical analyses after the measurement of runoff volume sediment concentration soil surface physical properties and vegetation cover variations for all study plots a data bank was developed in excel 2013 software package the shapiro wilk test was used to evaluate the data normality differences in runoff sediment and soil surface morphological properties in treated and control plots for each rainfall event were analyzed using paired samples and or independent t tests at 95 confidence level the analysis of variance anova was also applied to evaluate the vegetation cover variations and soil surface morphological characteristics over time rainfall events and space plots sadeghi et al 2015 2016a b 2017 2018 the ibm spss statistics 23 software package was used for analyses 3 results 3 1 runoff and soil loss data statistical analyses of measured surface runoff from the treated and control plots on a rainfall event basis are shown in fig 3 additionally other components of runoff viz volume height and coefficient for all rainfall events are presented in table 2 the results of corresponding statistical analyses of sediment concentration in the study treatments for all rainfall events are given in table 3 on 17 february 2018 significant differences were identified in runoff generation p 0 01 fig 3 and sediment concentration p 0 05 table 4 between the treatments where the soil surface was bare and the first erosive rainfall i30 4 427 mm h 1 h 13 mm m 2 table 1 occurred after several dry months in the control and inoculated plots the generated runoff and sediment concentration was 43 6 08 and 27 67 5 13 l fig 3 and 4 22 0 22 and 3 53 0 34 g l 1 table 3 respectively therefore cyanobacteria inoculation led to a 36 and 16 reduction in the runoff volume and coefficient p 0 01 and sediment concentration p 0 05 respectively in the second erosive rainfall event 22 february 2018 after five days of the first rainfall event table 1 some 95 13 l runoff fig 3 and 4 16 0 32 g l 1 sediment table 3 were measured for the control plots in the cyanobacteria treated plots the runoff volume and sediment concentration were 71 33 4 93 l i e 25 lower than control p 0 05 and 2 72 0 15 g l 1 i e 34 lower than control p 0 01 respectively in addition to two rainfall events in the mid winter two other consecutive rainfall events also occurred at the winter end including the 04 and 05 march 2018 rainfall events table 1 however unlike two previous rainfall events the durations of these rainfalls were short 10 and 20 min respectively and corresponding average intensities were high and partly intensive 100 20 and 35 10 mm h 1 respectively the collected runoff and sediment from control and inoculated plots were 84 8 72 and 89 10 15 l and 3 71 0 41 and 2 36 0 46 g l 1 for 04 march 2018 and 57 66 8 08 and 59 2 64 l and 1 05 0 05 and 1 02 0 04 g l 1 for 05 march 2018 respectively fig 3 and table 3 accordingly inoculated cyanobacteria on the plots reduced runoff volume and coefficient by 31 34 for 04 march 2018 p 0 05 and 37 71 for 05 march 2018 p 0 01 respectively fig 3 and table 2 although on the 04 march 2018 rainfall event the inoculation of cyanobacteria led to a 36 beneficial reduction p 0 05 in sediment concentration compared to that recorded for the control plot by the way the difference was not significant for the 05 march 2018 event table 3 for the 30 march 2018 storm event another intensive rainfall with i30 22 28 for 270 min duration was recorded table 1 this rainfall led to generate 32 33 8 02 l runoff runoff coefficient 4 67 1 16 and 2 36 0 04 g l 1 sediment from control plots however the cyanobacteria were able to reduce runoff by 46 p 0 05 runoff volume 17 33 3 05 l runoff coefficient 2 50 0 44 and sediment concentration by 13 56 p 0 01 from inoculated plots in comparison with control conditions fig 3 and tables 2 and 3 the sixth rainfall event occurred on 27 april 2018 i30 3 677 d 70 min for which the runoff volume of 13 33 3 78 l and runoff depth of 0 32 0 09 mm m 2 were recorded for control and against respective amounts of 7 1 l and 0 19 0 03 mm m 2 for the inoculated plots fig 3 and table 1 verifying a reduction benefit of some 4 5 in runoff yield due to the inoculation of cyanobacteria p 0 05 however there was no significant difference between control 3 15 0 26 g l 1 and inoculated 3 01 0 19 g l 1 treatments in terms of sediment concentration table 3 finally in the last rainfall event 24 may 2018 i30 23 51 d 170 min like previous events cyanobacteria significantly reduced p 0 01 the runoff yield from 18 3 l control plots to 7 66 1 53 l inoculated plots with a reduction benefit of about 57 fig 3 and table 1 as an unexpected observation the sediment concentration table 3 increased by 49 75 in the cyanobacteria inoculated plots 2 98 0 20 g l 1 compared to that recorded for the control plots 1 99 0 09 g l 1 3 2 soil surface physical properties table 4 shows the values and statistical analyses of the morphological properties of sscs in the control and inoculated plots the results indicated that in the control and inoculated plots dc awmarp awmfrac and r varied from 10 45 to 11 74 1 49 to 1 65 1 26 to 1 30 and 0 283 to 0 295 and 8 32 to 8 91 2 51 to 2 86 1 17 to 1 30 and 0 270 to 0 277 respectively according to the results in the inoculated plots dc awmfrac and r except for rainfall event of 21 february 2018 of sscs were respectively 17 to 27 6 to 8 9 5 1 to 7 4 lower than those of the control plots p 0 05 table 4 on the other hand the calculated awmarp in the cyanobacteria inoculated plots was 60 to 73 more than that of the control plots p 0 01 table 4 in addition according to the anova results each of the above mentioned properties had no significant differences over time p 0 05 whilst the sscs patterns of the control and cyanobacteria inoculated soils were different from each other the numbers of cracks in the surface of control conditions were more than those seen in the inoculated plots however the perimeter volume values of the cracks in the cyanobacteria inoculated soils were larger than those recorded for the control plots table 4 therefore soil infiltration capability in the inoculated plots was better than in control plots analyses of ssr in the study treatments are also presented in table 5 and fig 4 for pre and post rainfall events the surface 3d plots from the soil surfaces before and after rainfall event of 17 february 2018 are exemplified in fig 5 according to anova results table 5 ssrs were different during the experiment p 0 01 with a significant effect on ssr p 0 01 however the ssr changes were not significant for different rainfall events p 0 05 the paired sample t test analyses fig 4 showed that in the control plots the ssr significantly declined after rainfall events 11 to 17 while in the cyanobacteria inoculated plots the ssr difference was not significant before and after rainfall events according to statistical analyses fig 4 and 3d surface plots of the soil fig 5 the greater ssr was found in the inoculated plots than in control plots these results also indicated that after rainfall events ssrs in the inoculated plots were higher 14 to 20 than those in the control plots results and statistical analyses of mdw as an indicator for sas indicated that after rainfall events mwd in the control and inoculated plots varied from 1 16 to 1 23 mm and 1 35 to 1 42 mm respectively table 6 in the inoculated plots mwd was 13 to 22 greater than those in the control plots therefore inoculation of cyanobacteria significantly increased sas sem and lom images further indicated that the soil particles were well aggregated in the inoculated plots compared to the control plots fig 6 3 3 vegetation cover variations the values and analyses of the ta index of the study plots during the experiment period are presented in fig 7 results showed that tas in the control and inoculated plots were 3 70 and 3 77 5 1 and 5 27 and 13 16 and 13 50 at three recording times of 26 december 2017 beginning 25 march 2018 intermediate and 23 may 2018 end of the experiment period respectively fig 7 although ta in both treatments increased over time p 0 05 but no significant differences were observed between treatments p 0 05 fig 7 generally at the end of the experiment the vegetation cover in both control and inoculated plots increased by 2 6 times compared to that recorded at the beginning 3 4 cyanobacteria developments on soil surface according to the results in fig 8 at the beginning of the experiment 26 december 2017 the biomass of cyanobacteria was 0 77 0 09 and 0 78 0 12 µg kg 1 without significant difference in the control and the inoculated plots respectively however the biomass of cyanobacteria at the end of the experiment 23 may 2018 was higher at tune of 25 and 82 compared to the initial time respectively in the control and inoculated plots by and large the development of cyanobacteria on the surface of inoculated plots was 48 greater than that of the control plots 3 5 environmental and economic analyses the microscopic monitoring showed that cyanobacteria cells in the runoff and sediment samples collected from treatments after a long span time were not considerable 3 cfu the cost analyses of the cyanobacteria inoculation and some common soil conservation methods table 7 also indicated that inoculation of cyanobacteria could be a cost effective method usd 350 ha 1 4 discussion land cover is clearly the most important determinant factor for runoff and sediment generation cerdà et al 2018 in the bare and or degraded lands a large part of rainfall flows to the outlet of the watershed as overland flow containing high concentration of sediments due to spatially incomplete cover cerdan et al 2010 the same findings were verified for the 17 and 22 february 2018 rainfall events for the control plots fig 3 and tables 2 and 3 to confirm the results the ta indices indicated that the vegetation cover was very low in both plots at the early stages of the experiment fig 7 on one hand low vegetation cover failed to protect soil surface against raindrop impacts as hou et al 2015 observed an exponential negative correlation between soil particles detachment and ta index of vegetation cover in the bare lands and or with low vegetation cover splash erosion induced by erosive rainfall is dominant fernández raga et al 2017 therefore detached particles induced by direct raindrop impact in addition to being a source of sediment also contribute to the formation of soil crusting and surface sealing armenise et al 2018 as observed in the control plots after the study rainfall events e g fig 5b a notable reduction was also found in ssr in the control plots after rainfall events fig 4 particularly in the low vegetation cover conditions fig 7 this can be due to the effect of soil surface sealing induced by splash erosion zhao et al 2014 surface sealing also led to the formation of complex thinner and shallow cracks on the soil surface bullard et al 2018b and ultimately the reduction in soil permeability gopal et al 2019 our results indicated that in the control plots the narrow cracks lower in width and or perimeter were formed on the soil surface according to the high values of awmfrac and r as well as low values of awmarp table 4 this process led to an increase in overland runoff and sediment concentration from the above mentioned lands especially on hillslopes and in fall and winter as observed in the control plots of experiment period for the 17 and 22 february 2018 and 04 and 05 march 2018 events according to the results fig 7 the low density of vegetation cover at the beginning fall of the experiment period was found as a reason for increasing runoff and sediment generation low development of vegetation cover resulted in increased runoff and soil loss as reported by lucas borja et al 2018 however some other factors like rainfall intensity and duration zhang et al 2018 previous rainfall events and time intervals sadeghi et al 2016b bullard et al 2018b antecedent soil moisture sachs and sarah 2017 ssr figs 4 and 5 sscs pattern and volume table 4 rodríguez caballero et al 2012 might also affect runoff and soil loss of the study experiments in this regard the higher runoff volume in the control plots for the 22 february 2018 event than that of the 17 february 2018 event might be incorporated with high antecedent soil moisture content resulting from previous rainfall it led to decrease the soil water capacity and infiltration rate lam et al 2016 sachs and sarah 2017 and subsequent runoff generation high r irregular pattern and awmfrac and low awmarp of the sscs table 4 and reduction in ssr fig 4 and then soil sealing by the raindrop impacts fig 5b of the first rainfall 17 february 2018 could be a reason behind the increased runoff in the consequent event of 22 february 2018 in addition in the consecutive rainfall events limited sediment availability for subsequent events is one the important factors in controlling soil loss from the slopes sadeghi et al 2016b bullard et al 2018b similarly sediment concentration decreased by half on 05 march 2018 1 05 0 05 g l 1 compared to that recorded for the 04 march 2018 event 3 71 0 41 g l 1 in spring started by late march as per iranian calendar the partial improvement of the vegetation cover fig 7 and better climatological conditions affected the hydrological behavior of study plots increasing of vegetation cover lucas borja et al 2018 air soil and raindrop temperature sachs and sarah 2017 surface evaporation rate liu et al 2015 and microbial activities chamizo et al 2012a might also influence runoff and soil loss as it occurred during the 30 march 27 april and 24 may 2018 rainfall events fig 3 and table 3 from the knowledge of the effects of the above discussed factors on runoff and soil loss generation the strategy used in this context must somehow control their impacts on bare lands as cyanobacteria inoculation based technique did the environmental conditions particularly air humidity illumination temperature and soil moisture are key factors in successful field establishment of the inoculated cyanobacteria on the soil pathak et al 2018 the inoculation time autumn and winter seasons of the present experiment did not restrict the establishment of inoculated cyanobacteria despite the dominance of cold temperatures 0 5 c it realized the effectiveness of inoculated treatment on decreasing runoff and soil loss in rainfall events fig 3 tables 2 and 3 however six non erosive rainfall 2 4 4 6 4 4 0 7 9 6 and 2 1 mm events supplied necessary moisture during inoculation time to the first erosive rainfall event from the results of the first rainfall event i e 17 february 2018 the cyanobacteria showed their effectiveness after 50 days of inoculation time 26 december 2017 in this regard the required times of 30 and 60 days acea et al 2003 nisha et al 2007 kheirfam et al 2017a b 90 days chamizo et al 2018 and one year wang et al 2009 park et al 2017 after inoculation have been reported for thorough establishment and development of cyanobacteria on the soil intrinsically cyanobacteria have a high ability to absorb water by their cell walls during rainfall colica et al 2014 and their cellular elasticity property increases the ability of maximum water absorption even up to 12 times of the cell volume powell et al 2015 and to store the absorbed water for several days rossi et al 2015 accordingly high density of cyanobacteria cells in the soil surface after inoculation of 0 526 g m 2 provided the possibility of absorbing part of the rain induced water sadeghi et al 2017 and leading to less contribution of rainfall to runoff generation fig 3 tables 2 and 3 chamizo et al 2018 found that the inoculated cyanobacteria formed a thick layer on the topsoil which can cover and protect the soil surface against raindrop impacts and leads to decrease the soil detachment and then restricts sediment accessibility for translocation by runoff kheirfam et al 2017b bullard et al 2018a also observed that the rainfall increased the swelling of cyanobacteria filaments results of the current study indicated that the biomass of cyanobacteria on the soil surface considerably increased after six months fig 7 as shown in fig 6 high excrete exopolysaccharides secretions of cyanobacteria especially nostoc sp muñoz rojas et al 2018a known as one of the prominent features of cyanobacteria rossi and de philippis 2015 that helps them stick around fine soil particles williams et al 2018 this sticky coating adheres the fine particles together and form microscopic resistance structures to detachment induced by raindrops fig 6 kheirfam et al 2017b along with this the excrete exopolysaccharides can act as a semi super absorbent sadeghi et al 2017 leading to decrease the runoff generation accordingly secretions of inoculated cyanobacteria on the treated plots could be one of the reasons for decreased runoff and soil loss development of cyanobacteria crust in the field as the final stage of inoculation purpose park et al 2017 has also the maximum effect on soil hydrological behavior among all cyanobacteria characteristics belnap 2006 our results also confirmed the good development of inoculated cyanobacteria on the soil surface fig 7 based on the microscopic view of the inoculated soil used in the current study fig 6 in the cyanobacteria dominated bscs the filaments create soil macro structures from fine particles as interconnected chains raanan et al 2016 kheirfam et al 2017b in the medium and fine textured soils as our clay loam study soil the inoculated cyanobacteria filaments formed micro porous channels in the topsoil belnap et al 2013 through interconnecting soil particles fig 6 and thus soil porosity and permeability increased miralles et al 2011 the increases of awmarp and decreases of awmfrac and r indicators of soil cracks table 4 indicated that the sscs width perimeter volume and regularity increased in the inoculated cyanobacteria plots compared to control the improvement of sscs indicators in the inoculated plots also led to the increase in soil permeability and the consequent reduction in runoff from the study plots during rainfall events inoubli et al 2016 also found that the increase of topsoil cracks volume reduced runoff generation from hillslopes likewise increases in ssr play an important role in decreasing runoff velocity creating an opportunity for runoff infiltration into the soil zhao et al 2014 in this study increases in ssr due to the inoculation of cyanobacteria figs 4 and 5c could be one of the reasons for the reduction of runoff generation from inoculated plots in comparison with control plots fig 3 as rodríguez caballero et al 2012 and zhao et al 2018 denoted in addition the cyanobacteria dominated bscs are able to control raindrops impacts and then lead to decreases soil surface sealing as confirmed by the present study results showed that in the inoculated plots ssr had no significant difference before and after rainfall events whereas ssr significantly decreased after rainfall events in the control plots fig 4 however before the occurrence of all rainfall events except to 10 march 2018 ssr was not significantly different in control and inoculated treatments fig 4 contrary to the present findings bullard et al 2018a found that greater soil surface roughness resulted from the inoculation of cyanobacteria in our study the inoculated cyanobacteria just controlled the ssr reduction after rainfall events however the decrease in ssr of coarse textured soils by cyanobacteria has been previously reported malamissa et al 2009 rodríguez caballero et al 2013 chamizo et al 2018 the greater mwd as an sas indicator in the inoculation plots table 6 confirmed that the cyanobacteria could improve soil particle aggregation and then create soil micro structures by their exopolysaccharides secretion and filaments it was proven by lom and sem images taken from the treated soils as shown in fig 6 furthermore according to mwd values for control 1 16 to 1 23 and inoculated soils 1 35 to 1 42 as well as the criterion suggested by le bissonnais 1996 sass of the study soils were categorized in the medium stable and stable aggregations respectively it therefore resulted in increasing soil permeability and decreasing the detachment of soil particles and soil loss fig 3 and table 3 as already reported by belnap et al 2013 raanan et al 2016 and kheirfam et al 2017b along with the above mentioned process secreted exopolysaccharides by the inoculated cyanobacteria could also act as micro mulch caused decrease in splash erosion kheirfam et al 2017b williams et al 2018 controlling splash erosion also led to improve sscs patterns and volume and increase in ssr figs 3 and 4 tables 3 and 5 which consequently tended to the decrease in runoff generation and soil loss in this study the functionality of cyanobacteria decreased runoff and soil loss in the inoculated treatment at the rainfall event scale particularly in months of april to may 2018 because of suitable vegetation cover fig 7 and also appropriate air humidity and temperature conditions in light of our results the rates of cyanobacteria influence on runoff generation and sediment concentration were different so that the beneficial reduction of 35 25 31 33 46 47 and 57 in runoff and 16 34 36 2 13 4 and 49 in sediment concentration were observed for the first to seventh studied rainfall events respectively fig 3 tables 2 and 3 after a dryness period in the first rainfall event cyanobacteria were not able to reduce the sediment concentration due to unlimited sediment accessibility as confirmed by sadeghi et al 2016b and armenise et al 2018 antecedent soil moisture content at the second rainfall event reduced the ability of cyanobacteria in controlling runoff than sediment due to low soil permeability in subsequent rainfall events in the third and fourth events in the later rainfall the inoculated and control treatments had the same effect on sediment concentration whereas the effect of cyanobacteria on runoff reduction was more than on sediment concentration finally increasing of vegetation cover in the spring fig 7 concurrent with fifth sixth and seventh events had an influential role in reducing runoff and sediment from both inoculated and control plots in the control and inoculated plots the differences in ta index as vegetation cover indicator was not significant therefore the reduction of runoff and sediment generation from inoculated plots was only controlled by cyanobacterization it was also found fig 8 that despite gradual increase in population of cyanobacteria in the abandoned land inoculation of cyanobacteria could facilitate the initial stage formation of bscs at the end and in the defense of the positive role of cyanobacteria inoculation in controlling runoff and sediment generation the environmental impact and economic assessment of this newly introduced technique is essential before wide application although no specific focus was made on environmental aspects of the treatments in the current research a simple analysis showed that the inoculated cyanobacteria exhibited the least amount of transmission by runoff and sediment from the plots high tendency and capability of soil cyanobacteria to stick on the solid substrates prevent their easy transfer by runoff belnap 2006 despite some reports on the harmful effects of imported or introduced cyanobacteria to the soil i e bouaïcha and corbel 2016 and water i e manubolu et al 2018 there is no report on the adverse effect of soil native cyanobacteria on the ecosystems however insightful investigations into environmental impacts of high dense inoculated cyanobacteria on the ecosystems are strongly advised as the cost effectiveness is a key factor in the implementation of techniques soil inoculation by cyanobacteria was found to be an economically efficient and practically user friendly technique compared to some other common amendments e g biochar polyacrylamides manure and straw mulch with specific constraints of instability lehmann and joseph 2015 detrimental environmental effects woodrow et al 2008 and limited site accessibility blanco and lal 2008 fast low tech and inexpensive production and easy inoculation process are other advantages of cyanobacteria to be adopted for soil and water conservation in different regions 5 conclusion high runoff generation and soil loss on the bare and degraded hillslopes due to erosive rainfall in the wet seasons are among important environmental challenges in semi arid areas field soil inoculation with cyanobacteria at the end of the dry season lead to rapid formation of cyanobacteria crust and reduced runoff and soil loss the effect of 50 day time spanned cyanobacteria inoculation as a cost and time effective technique was shown for runoff and soil loss reduction to the respective tune of 57 and 36 it can be also roughly concluded from this study that the inoculation effects on runoff and soil loss were variable depending on antecedent soil moisture rainfall intensity duration and frequency air and soil humidity and temperature sediment source accessibility and vegetation cover it was further found that inoculated cyanobacteria reduced runoff and soil loss through preserving soil surface roughness improving soil crack patterns and volume increasing soil aggregate stability adhering soil fine particles together and covering soil surface inoculation of cyanobacteria was more effective for runoff and sediment reduction in winter inappropriate environmental conditions than in spring suitable conditions although self restoration of abandoned and degraded lands is possible after a longtime inoculation of cyanobacteria could be therefore supposed as a quick adaptable and cost effective strategy to use for drylands restoration by and large findings of this research somewhat attracted concerns regarding the field application of cyanobacteria inoculation after numerous laboratory studies however further investigations are needed about long term environmental impact assessments and application of cyanobacteria inoculation based technique in various temporal and spatial conditions to develop a comprehensive decision system for restoration of degraded lands credit authorship contribution statement seyed hamidreza sadeghi

this manuscript was handled by marco borga editor in chief with the assistance of christian massari associate editor graphical abstract controlling runoff generation and soil loss from hillslopes is a priority for land management the capability of cyanobacteria as inoculants has recently been utilized in land management and as a result various lab scale studies have been conducted the present study conducted a field pilot experiment in miandoab city south of west azerbaijan province north west iran to evaluate the success of cyanobacteria inoculation in runoff and sediment reduction from an abandoned and degraded land at large plot scale under natural rainfall on 26 december 2017 the cultured native cyanobacteria nostoc sp and oscillatoria sp was inoculated on the 22 1 1 83 m2 plot in three replicates along with three control plots treated by pure water the runoff and soil loss from the treated plots were measured for seven rainfall events that produced runoff during normal rainy season of the study area i e december 2017 to may 2018 results showed that inoculation of cyanobacteria significantly p 0 05 decreased runoff by some 35 25 31 33 46 47 and 57 for the recorded rainfall events 1 to 7 respectively the beneficial reduction of sediment concentration due to the inoculation of cyanobacteria was also observed for rainfall events 1 2 3 and 5 at the respective tune of 16 34 36 and 135 compared to those of control plots soil cracks indicators roughness and aggregate stability were also improved by 5 1 to 27 14 to 20 and 13 to 22 respectively owing to the inoculation of cyanobacteria although vegetation cover at the end of experiment was 2 6 times denser than that in the beginning there was no significant difference between inoculated and control plots by and large field inoculation of cyanobacteria was found as an efficient technique for runoff and soil loss inhibition particularly in degraded and abandoned drylands keywords biological control

sediment generationfrom the beginning to the end particularly in degradation prone landscapes is crucial to that end inhibiting runoff generation and soil loss at the early stages is regarded as the best management practice kheirfam et al 2017b leading to more sustainable ecosystem with higher efficiency and lower cost soil particle detachment by raindrops splash erosion from hillslopes is the first step of the soil degradation process especially in abandoned drylands where the soil surface is bare and consequently runoff generation and sediment concentration are high van loo et al 2017 anache et al 2018 during rainfall and or erosive rainfall events however improving the physical chemical and biological properties of the soil surface is a way to conserve bare hillslopes against

hillslope scale without any moisture supplying and controlling environmental condition cyanobacteria are microscopic photo autotrophic prokaryotic organisms that can be intensively found in the biological soil crusts bscs bowker et al 2010 cyanobacteria can increase soil aggregation and stability costa et al 2018 facilitate changing soil micro structures to macro structures colica et al 2014

both excrete exopolysaccharides and develop filaments rossi et al 2017 chamizo et al 2018 these lead to improving soil water infiltration and soil particle resistance and thus decrease soil loss and balance runoff behavior although cyanobacteria are present in most environments belnap et al 2013 their role is much more prominent in low and non vegetated lands especially abandoned drylands where the soil is unprotected against raindrop blows the ability of cyanobacteria as dominant members of dryland bscs in degraded lands has been thwarted because of notable removal of surface soil by erosive factors wind and or water erosion additionally in the newly abandoned lands bscs are also less developed as described above rehabilitation of their bscs by the cyanobacteria inoculation technique has been proved as a bio tool and eco friendly measure to restore dry and abandoned lands against intensive runoff generation and high soil loss kheirfam et al 2017a b sadeghi et al 2017 rossi et al 2017 chamizo et al 2018 muñoz rojas et al 2018b however it is still not quite clear whether this technique will be successful in a completely natural condition and without any support this current study therefore has been formulated to evaluate the effectiveness of native cyanobacteria inoculation on balancing runoff volume and sediment concentration this initiative was actualized at a large plot scale installed in an abandoned land in a semiarid region of nw iran for natural rains occurred from december 2017 to may 2018 in addition some soil surface physical characteristics viz soil cracks roughness aggregate stability and particle arrangement and also variation in vegetation cover were measured and then analyzed during the experiment period to appropriately discuss the findings 2 materials and methods 2 1 site description and soil sampling in order to assess the effects of cyanobacteria inoculation on soil and water conservation three universal soil loss equation

respectively some 97 freezing days october to march have also been recorded in a year for the region the area has been mainly covered by peganum harmala and poa bulbosa with less than 3 and 10 cover density respectively the general location of the study area is shown in fig 1 the native cyanobacteria from the study site were used for the study soil samples were collected from the upper 5 cm of the soil layer chamizo et al 2012a of hillslope in august 2017 dry season the samples were taken to the soil and microbiology laboratories at the urmia lake research institute urmia university urmia iran and air dried and then sieved to 2 mm chamizo et al 2012b for using in cyanobacteria culturing processes 2 2 cyanobacteria culturing first the cyanobacteria from the soil microorganism bank were cultured by bg11 and chu10 media in 8 cm petri dishes as solid phase at 25 to 28 c under box cutler environment for 14 10 h light dark cycles andersen 2005 the isolated cyanobacteria were then transferred to the liquid phase of the media afterwards the cyanobacteria were identified based on standard protocols bergey and breed 1957 komárek 2006 whitton and potts 2012 the soil cyanobacteria were identified at the genus level using the morphological based methods with the help of high resolution microscope due to their good performance komárek et al 2014 and the inaccessibility to molecular identification method an introductory microscopic study was also conducted towards this soil samples were placed in sterile petri dishes covered with sterile cover slips moistened with sterile water and incubated in the incubation chamber the cover slips were then removed and actively growing algae was examined under the microscope komárek and anagnostidis 1998 komárek 2013 among the representatives of blue green algae nostoc punctiforme and lyngbya martensiana were the most common species found in all soil samples then nostoc sp and oscillatoria sp were eventually selected based on their broad presence in the samples aboal et al 2016 and successful results for similar studies under lab conditions in the previous studies kheirfam et al 2017a b sadeghi et al 2017 based on the procedures reported by buchanan and gibbons 1974 komárek 2006 and whitton and potts 2012 the selected cyanobacteria were continuously proliferated with a constant input of sterile air until a biomass concentration of 1010 cfu 2 11 g of dry weight per liter was achieved kheirfam et al 2017a and b sadeghi et al 2017 finally 61 l of cyanobacteria inoculum was prepared for treating study plots the cyanobacteria of the study soil were also extracted from the control and inoculated plots and cultured again at the start and the end of the experiment period with the same procedure to compare the abundance of cyanobacteria so 20 ml liquid sample of the extracted cyanobacteria from each plot was taken at the beginning and after 30 days of experiment and centrifuged 8000 rpm for 15 min at 4 c to collect cyanobacteria cells ansari and fatma 2016 the collected cyanobacteria cells were freeze died and then weighted 2 3 field plot installation and inoculation a total of six galvanized steel erosion plots 22 1 1 83 m2 were installed in the middle of a uniform hillslope with a mean slope from 25 to 30 in the late autumn of 2017 additionally a 200 liter tank was established at the lower end of each plot to collect runoff and washed soils during rainfall events mohamadi and kavian 2015 afterwards we directly inoculated 500 ml m 2 0 526 g m 2 of cyanobacteria on the soil surface of all three plots using backpack sprayer wang et al 2009 as cyanobacteria inoculated treatment along with this 500 ml m 2 of pure water was sprayed on the control plots to create the same moisture conditions for both treatments kheirfam et al 2017a 2 4 rainfall runoff and sediment measurements overall 46 different rainfall events were reported for the study area during 26 december 2017 inoculation day and 24 may 2018 end of experiment out of which seven generating runoff and erosive rainfall runoff events were recorded after each rainfall the volume of the collected runoff in each tank from the two study treatments was measured mohamadi and kavian 2015 next the runoff laden sediment of tank contents was mixed thoroughly polyakov and lal 2008 and 1 l samples were taken to determine the sediment concentration from each plot the collected samples were allowed to settle for some 48 h and clear supernatant was decanted from the containers and the residuals were finally oven dried at 105 c for 24 h mohammadi et al 2018 the properties of rainfall events were analyzed with the help of rainfall hyetographs collected for the meteorological station in the vicinity 300 m of the study site as summarized in table 1 2 5 soil surface property measurements cracks roughness soil aggregate stability and soil particles bound on the upper surface of soil were studied in the current research since such important physical properties of the soil appreciably influence the soil performance in the generation of runoff and soil loss shit et al 2015 luna et al 2018 to determine soil surface cracks sscs and roughness three images 331 339 pixels were taken using a digital camera 12 megapixel canon xc10 hd camcorder japan under moderate light condition from 10 cm above and perpendicular to each plot surface bauer and strauss 2014 after five days of each rainfall event the pores particles and cracks analysis system pcas professional software liu et al 2011 was used to identify and quantify sscs the images were preprocessed and segmented in accordance with the method proposed by liu et al 2013 then the various characteristics of sscs patterns such as node and crack numbers length width perimeter direction and area of each ssc were calculated automatically by the pcas software the entire process of the proposed methodology for a study sample is presented in fig 2 afterwards the density of sscs dc the area weighted mean ratio of sscs area to perimeter awmarp and the area weighted mean of crack fractal dimension awmfrac as sscs morphological complexity indicators and the sscs morphological connectivity r were calculated by eqs 1 novak 1999 2 and 3 xiong et al 2009 and 4 xiong et al 2010 respectively 1 d c i 1 n a c a c 100 2 awmarp i 1 m j j 1 n a

surface area of the typical cracked soil in mm2 the cracks perimeter in mm number of observation the number of connected cracks and the number of crack nodes the dc awmarp awmfrac and r vary between 0 and 100 0 to 100 1 to 2 and 0 to 1 respectively to quantify the soil surface roughness ssr the three dimensional 3d surface plots were produced for the images with the help of the scanningprobeimageprocessor spiptm image metrology denmark software as a standard program for processing three dimensional surface topography data ihalainen et al 2011 ssr of the inoculated and control plots was quantified before and after each rainfall event furthermore the soil aggregate stability sas of the surface soil was also measured at the start and the end of the experiment to this end after wet sieving of soil samples mesh sizes of 2 1 0 5 and 0 25 mm kemper and rosenau 1986 the mean weighted diameter indicator eq 5 was used to determine aggregate sizes of the soils complied

sieving mm and the weight of aggregates in that size range as a fraction of the total dry weight of soil used respectively the light optical microscopy lom and scanning electron microscopy sem images were further taken from treated soils at the end of experiment to show the association of soil particles using high resolution optical microscopes olympus ix70 inverted fluorescent microscope tokyo japan and philips xl30 esem amsterdam the netherlands respectively the soil samples were taken from 12 points of each treatment four random samples for each plot and then were thoroughly mixed and finally 1 g soil samples were used for microscopic evaluation of each treated soil 2 6 vegetation cover variation assessment the general situation of vegetation cover was also assessed in the study since runoff and soil loss from hillslopes are also influenced by vegetation in addition to rainfall characteristics and soil properties casermeiro et al 2004 in this regard the vegetation cover variation and development on the study plots were measured three times at the beginning 26 dec 2017 intermediate 25 mar 2018 and end 23 may 2018 of the experimental period for each plot the vegetation cover area was calculated by measuring the crown diameter of plant the height of each plant was also directly measured by the ruler afterwards the total area of vegetation cover ta index liu et al 2018 was used to measure vegetation cover area of each plot finally the ta indices were comparatively analyzed in both inoculated and control treatments to determine the role of vegetation cover on runoff and soil loss from the plots 2 7 environmental impacts and economical assessment the environmental concern of the study treatment was also superficially considered using blooming concept of cyanobacteria manubolu et al 2018 to be informed of the amount and possible blooms of cyanobacteria washed from the plots a 1 l sample was collected from each runoff and sediment tank after each rainfall event the samples were then kept at the room temperature light 25 c 14 10 h light dark cycles for giving three month time to grow the washed cyanobacteria from the plots to this end visual inspection and optical microscopic monitoring were regularly used since the economic valuation of runoff and sediment controlling techniques need complex methods we only made a comparative study with other methods widely applied for soil and water conservation throughout iran 2 8 statistical analyses after the measurement of runoff volume sediment concentration soil surface physical properties and vegetation cover variations for all study plots a data bank was developed in excel 2013 software package the shapiro wilk test was used to evaluate the data normality differences in runoff sediment and soil surface morphological properties in treated and control plots for each rainfall event were analyzed using paired samples and or independent t tests at 95 confidence level the analysis of variance anova was also applied to evaluate the vegetation cover variations and soil surface morphological characteristics over time rainfall events and space plots sadeghi et al 2015 2016a b 2017 2018 the ibm spss statistics 23 software package was used for analyses 3 results 3 1 runoff and soil loss data statistical analyses of measured surface runoff from the treated and control plots on a rainfall event basis are shown in fig 3 additionally other components of runoff viz volume height and coefficient for all rainfall events are presented in table 2 the results of corresponding statistical analyses of sediment concentration in the study treatments for all rainfall events are given in table 3 on 17 february 2018 significant differences were identified in runoff generation p 0 01 fig 3 and sediment concentration p 0 05 table 4 between the treatments where the soil surface was bare and the first erosive rainfall i30 4 427 mm h 1 h 13 mm m 2 table 1 occurred after several dry months in the control and inoculated plots the generated runoff and sediment concentration was 43 6 08 and 27 67 5 13 l fig 3 and 4 22 0 22 and 3 53 0 34 g l 1 table 3 respectively therefore cyanobacteria inoculation led to a 36 and 16 reduction in the runoff volume and coefficient p 0 01 and sediment concentration p 0 05 respectively in the second erosive rainfall event 22 february 2018 after five days of the first rainfall event table 1 some 95 13 l runoff fig 3 and 4 16 0 32 g l 1 sediment table 3 were measured for the control plots in the cyanobacteria treated plots the runoff volume and sediment concentration were 71 33 4 93 l i e 25 lower than control p 0 05 and 2 72 0 15 g l 1 i e 34 lower than control p 0 01 respectively in addition to two rainfall events in the mid winter two other consecutive rainfall events also occurred at the winter end including the 04 and 05 march 2018 rainfall events table 1 however unlike two previous rainfall events the durations of these rainfalls were short 10 and 20 min respectively and corresponding average intensities were high and partly intensive 100 20 and 35 10 mm h 1 respectively the collected runoff and sediment from control and inoculated plots were 84 8 72 and 89 10 15 l and 3 71 0 41 and 2 36 0 46 g l 1 for 04 march 2018 and 57 66 8 08 and 59 2 64 l and 1 05 0 05 and 1 02 0 04 g l 1 for 05 march 2018 respectively fig 3 and table 3 accordingly inoculated cyanobacteria on the plots reduced runoff volume and coefficient by 31 34 for 04 march 2018 p 0 05 and 37 71 for 05 march 2018 p 0 01 respectively fig 3 and table 2 although on the 04 march 2018 rainfall event the inoculation of cyanobacteria led to a 36 beneficial reduction p 0 05 in sediment concentration compared to that recorded for the control plot by the way the difference was not significant for the 05 march 2018 event table 3 for the 30 march 2018 storm event another intensive rainfall with i30 22 28 for 270 min duration was recorded table 1 this rainfall led to generate 32 33 8 02 l runoff runoff coefficient 4 67 1 16 and 2 36 0 04 g l 1 sediment from control plots however the cyanobacteria were able to reduce runoff by 46 p 0 05 runoff volume 17 33 3 05 l runoff coefficient 2 50 0 44 and sediment concentration by 13 56 p 0 01 from inoculated plots in comparison with control conditions fig 3 and tables 2 and 3 the sixth rainfall event occurred on 27 april 2018 i30 3 677 d 70 min for which the runoff volume of 13 33 3 78 l and runoff depth of 0 32 0 09 mm m 2 were recorded for control and against respective amounts of 7 1 l and 0 19 0 03 mm m 2 for the inoculated plots fig 3 and table 1 verifying a reduction benefit of some 4 5 in runoff yield due to the inoculation of cyanobacteria p 0 05 however there was no significant difference between control 3 15 0 26 g l 1 and inoculated 3 01 0 19 g l 1 treatments in terms of sediment concentration table 3 finally in the last rainfall event 24 may 2018 i30 23 51 d 170 min like previous events cyanobacteria significantly reduced p 0 01 the runoff yield from 18 3 l control plots to 7 66 1 53 l inoculated plots with a reduction benefit of about 57 fig 3 and table 1 as an unexpected observation the sediment concentration table 3 increased by 49 75 in the cyanobacteria inoculated plots 2 98 0 20 g l 1 compared to that recorded for the control plots 1 99 0 09 g l 1 3 2 soil surface physical properties table 4 shows the values and statistical analyses of the morphological properties of sscs in the control and inoculated plots the results indicated that in the control and inoculated plots dc awmarp awmfrac and r varied from 10 45 to 11 74 1 49 to 1 65 1 26 to 1 30 and 0 283 to 0 295 and 8 32 to 8 91 2 51 to 2 86 1 17 to 1 30 and 0 270 to 0 277 respectively according to the results in the inoculated plots dc awmfrac and r except for rainfall event of 21 february 2018 of sscs were respectively 17 to 27 6 to 8 9 5 1 to 7 4 lower than those of the control plots p 0 05 table 4 on the other hand the calculated awmarp in the cyanobacteria inoculated plots was 60 to 73 more than that of the control plots p 0 01 table 4 in addition according to the anova results each of the above mentioned properties had no significant differences over time p 0 05 whilst the sscs patterns of the control and cyanobacteria inoculated soils were different from each other the numbers of cracks in the surface of control conditions were more than those seen in the inoculated plots however the perimeter volume values of the cracks in the cyanobacteria inoculated soils were larger than those recorded for the control plots table 4 therefore soil infiltration capability in the inoculated plots was better than in control plots analyses of ssr in the study treatments are also presented in table 5 and fig 4 for pre and post rainfall events the surface 3d plots from the soil surfaces before and after rainfall event of 17 february 2018 are exemplified in fig 5 according to anova results table 5 ssrs were different during the experiment p 0 01 with a significant effect on ssr p 0 01 however the ssr changes were not significant for different rainfall events p 0 05 the paired sample t test analyses fig 4 showed that in the control plots the ssr significantly declined after rainfall events 11 to 17 while in the cyanobacteria inoculated plots the ssr difference was not significant before and after rainfall events according to statistical analyses fig 4 and 3d surface plots of the soil fig 5 the greater ssr was found in the inoculated plots than in control plots these results also indicated that after rainfall events ssrs in the inoculated plots were higher 14 to 20 than those in the control plots results and statistical analyses of mdw as an indicator for sas indicated that after rainfall events mwd in the control and inoculated plots varied from 1 16 to 1 23 mm and 1 35 to 1 42 mm respectively table 6 in the inoculated plots mwd was 13 to 22 greater than those in the control plots therefore inoculation of cyanobacteria significantly increased sas sem and lom images further indicated that the soil particles were well aggregated in the inoculated plots compared to the control plots fig 6 3 3 vegetation cover variations the values and analyses of the ta index of the study plots during the experiment period are presented in fig 7 results showed that tas in the control and inoculated plots were 3 70 and 3 77 5 1 and 5 27 and 13 16 and 13 50 at three recording times of 26 december 2017 beginning 25 march 2018 intermediate and 23 may 2018 end of the experiment period respectively fig 7 although ta in both treatments increased over time p 0 05 but no significant differences were observed between treatments p 0 05 fig 7 generally at the end of the experiment the vegetation cover in both control and inoculated plots increased by 2 6 times compared to that recorded at the beginning 3 4 cyanobacteria developments on soil surface according to the results in fig 8 at the beginning of the experiment 26 december 2017 the biomass of cyanobacteria was 0 77 0 09 and 0 78 0 12 µg kg 1 without significant difference in the control and the inoculated plots respectively however the biomass of cyanobacteria at the end of the experiment 23 may 2018 was higher at tune of 25 and 82 compared to the initial time respectively in the control and inoculated plots by and large the development of cyanobacteria on the surface of inoculated plots was 48 greater than that of the control plots 3 5 environmental and economic analyses the microscopic monitoring showed that cyanobacteria cells in the runoff and sediment samples collected from treatments after a long span time were not considerable 3 cfu the cost analyses of the cyanobacteria inoculation and some common soil conservation methods table 7 also indicated that inoculation of cyanobacteria could be a cost effective method usd 350 ha 1 4 discussion land cover is clearly the most important determinant factor for runoff and sediment generation cerdà et al 2018 in the bare and or degraded lands a large part of rainfall flows to the outlet of the watershed as overland flow containing high concentration of sediments due to spatially incomplete cover cerdan et al 2010 the same findings were verified for the 17 and 22 february 2018 rainfall events for the control plots fig 3 and tables 2 and 3 to confirm the results the ta indices indicated that the vegetation cover was very low in both plots at the early stages of the experiment fig 7 on one hand low vegetation cover failed to protect soil surface against raindrop impacts as hou et al 2015 observed an exponential negative correlation between soil particles detachment and ta index of vegetation cover in the bare lands and or with low vegetation cover splash erosion induced by erosive rainfall is dominant fernández raga et al 2017 therefore detached particles induced by direct raindrop impact in addition to being a source of sediment also contribute to the formation of soil crusting and surface sealing armenise et al 2018 as observed in the control plots after the study rainfall events e g fig 5b a notable reduction was also found in ssr in the control plots after rainfall events fig 4 particularly in the low vegetation cover conditions fig 7 this can be due to the effect of soil surface sealing induced by splash erosion zhao et al 2014 surface sealing also led to the formation of complex thinner and shallow cracks on the soil surface bullard et al 2018b and ultimately the reduction in soil permeability gopal et al 2019 our results indicated that in the control plots the narrow cracks lower in width and or perimeter were formed on the soil surface according to the high values of awmfrac and r as well as low values of awmarp table 4 this process led to an increase in overland runoff and sediment concentration from the above mentioned lands especially on hillslopes and in fall and winter as observed in the control plots of experiment period for the 17 and 22 february 2018 and 04 and 05 march 2018 events according to the results fig 7 the low density of vegetation cover at the beginning fall of the experiment period was found as a reason for increasing runoff and sediment generation low development of vegetation cover resulted in increased runoff and soil loss as reported by lucas borja et al 2018 however some other factors like rainfall intensity and duration zhang et al 2018 previous rainfall events and time intervals sadeghi et al 2016b bullard et al 2018b antecedent soil moisture sachs and sarah 2017 ssr figs 4 and 5 sscs pattern and volume table 4 rodríguez caballero et al 2012 might also affect runoff and soil loss of the study experiments in this regard the higher runoff volume in the control plots for the 22 february 2018 event than that of the 17 february 2018 event might be incorporated with high antecedent soil moisture content resulting from previous rainfall it led to decrease the soil water capacity and infiltration rate lam et al 2016 sachs and sarah 2017 and subsequent runoff generation high r irregular pattern and awmfrac and low awmarp of the sscs table 4 and reduction in ssr fig 4 and then soil sealing by the raindrop impacts fig 5b of the first rainfall 17 february 2018 could be a reason behind the increased runoff in the consequent event of 22 february 2018 in addition in the consecutive rainfall events limited sediment availability for subsequent events is one the important factors in controlling soil loss from the slopes sadeghi et al 2016b bullard et al 2018b similarly sediment concentration decreased by half on 05 march 2018 1 05 0 05 g l 1 compared to that recorded for the 04 march 2018 event 3 71 0 41 g l 1 in spring started by late march as per iranian calendar the partial improvement of the vegetation cover fig 7 and better climatological conditions affected the hydrological behavior of study plots increasing of vegetation cover lucas borja et al 2018 air soil and raindrop temperature sachs and sarah 2017 surface evaporation rate liu et al 2015 and microbial activities chamizo et al 2012a might also influence runoff and soil loss as it occurred during the 30 march 27 april and 24 may 2018 rainfall events fig 3 and table 3 from the knowledge of the effects of the above discussed factors on runoff and soil loss generation the strategy used in this context must somehow control their impacts on bare lands as cyanobacteria inoculation based technique did the environmental conditions particularly air humidity illumination temperature and soil moisture are key factors in successful field establishment of the inoculated cyanobacteria on the soil pathak et al 2018 the inoculation time autumn and winter seasons of the present experiment did not restrict the establishment of inoculated cyanobacteria despite the dominance of cold temperatures 0 5 c it realized the effectiveness of inoculated treatment on decreasing runoff and soil loss in rainfall events fig 3 tables 2 and 3 however six non erosive rainfall 2 4 4 6 4 4 0 7 9 6 and 2 1 mm events supplied necessary moisture during inoculation time to the first erosive rainfall event from the results of the first rainfall event i e 17 february 2018 the cyanobacteria showed their effectiveness after 50 days of inoculation time 26 december 2017 in this regard the required times of 30 and 60 days acea et al 2003 nisha et al 2007 kheirfam et al 2017a b 90 days chamizo et al 2018 and one year wang et al 2009 park et al 2017 after inoculation have been reported for thorough establishment and development of cyanobacteria on the soil intrinsically cyanobacteria have a high ability to absorb water by their cell walls during rainfall colica et al 2014 and their cellular elasticity property increases the ability of maximum water absorption even up to 12 times of the cell volume powell et al 2015 and to store the absorbed water for several days rossi et al 2015 accordingly high density of cyanobacteria cells in the soil surface after inoculation of 0 526 g m 2 provided the possibility of absorbing part of the rain induced water sadeghi et al 2017 and leading to less contribution of rainfall to runoff generation fig 3 tables 2 and 3 chamizo et al 2018 found that the inoculated cyanobacteria formed a thick layer on the topsoil which can cover and protect the soil surface against raindrop impacts and leads to decrease the soil detachment and then restricts sediment accessibility for translocation by runoff kheirfam et al 2017b bullard et al 2018a also observed that the rainfall increased the swelling of cyanobacteria filaments results of the current study indicated that the biomass of cyanobacteria on the soil surface considerably increased after six months fig 7 as shown in fig 6 high excrete exopolysaccharides secretions of cyanobacteria especially nostoc sp muñoz rojas et al 2018a known as one of the prominent features of cyanobacteria rossi and de philippis 2015 that helps them stick around fine soil particles williams et al 2018 this sticky coating adheres the fine particles together and form microscopic resistance structures to detachment induced by raindrops fig 6 kheirfam et al 2017b along with this the excrete exopolysaccharides can act as a semi super absorbent sadeghi et al 2017 leading to decrease the runoff generation accordingly secretions of inoculated cyanobacteria on the treated plots could be one of the reasons for decreased runoff and soil loss development of cyanobacteria crust in the field as the final stage of inoculation purpose park et al 2017 has also the maximum effect on soil hydrological behavior among all cyanobacteria characteristics belnap 2006 our results also confirmed the good development of inoculated cyanobacteria on the soil surface fig 7 based on the microscopic view of the inoculated soil used in the current study fig 6 in the cyanobacteria dominated bscs the filaments create soil macro structures from fine particles as interconnected chains raanan et al 2016 kheirfam et al 2017b in the medium and fine textured soils as our clay loam study soil the inoculated cyanobacteria filaments formed micro porous channels in the topsoil belnap et al 2013 through interconnecting soil particles fig 6 and thus soil porosity and permeability increased miralles et al 2011 the increases of awmarp and decreases of awmfrac and r indicators of soil cracks table 4 indicated that the sscs width perimeter volume and regularity increased in the inoculated cyanobacteria plots compared to control the improvement of sscs indicators in the inoculated plots also led to the increase in soil permeability and the consequent reduction in runoff from the study plots during rainfall events inoubli et al 2016 also found that the increase of topsoil cracks volume reduced runoff generation from hillslopes likewise increases in ssr play an important role in decreasing runoff velocity creating an opportunity for runoff infiltration into the soil zhao et al 2014 in this study increases in ssr due to the inoculation of cyanobacteria figs 4 and 5c could be one of the reasons for the reduction of runoff generation from inoculated plots in comparison with control plots fig 3 as rodríguez caballero et al 2012 and zhao et al 2018 denoted in addition the cyanobacteria dominated bscs are able to control raindrops impacts and then lead to decreases soil surface sealing as confirmed by the present study results showed that in the inoculated plots ssr had no significant difference before and after rainfall events whereas ssr significantly decreased after rainfall events in the control plots fig 4 however before the occurrence of all rainfall events except to 10 march 2018 ssr was not significantly different in control and inoculated treatments fig 4 contrary to the present findings bullard et al 2018a found that greater soil surface roughness resulted from the inoculation of cyanobacteria in our study the inoculated cyanobacteria just controlled the ssr reduction after rainfall events however the decrease in ssr of coarse textured soils by cyanobacteria has been previously reported malamissa et al 2009 rodríguez caballero et al 2013 chamizo et al 2018 the greater mwd as an sas indicator in the inoculation plots table 6 confirmed that the cyanobacteria could improve soil particle aggregation and then create soil micro structures by their exopolysaccharides secretion and filaments it was proven by lom and sem images taken from the treated soils as shown in fig 6 furthermore according to mwd values for control 1 16 to 1 23 and inoculated soils 1 35 to 1 42 as well as the criterion suggested by le bissonnais 1996 sass of the study soils were categorized in the medium stable and stable aggregations respectively it therefore resulted in increasing soil permeability and decreasing the detachment of soil particles and soil loss fig 3 and table 3 as already reported by belnap et al 2013 raanan et al 2016 and kheirfam et al 2017b along with the above mentioned process secreted exopolysaccharides by the inoculated cyanobacteria could also act as micro mulch caused decrease in splash erosion kheirfam et al 2017b williams et al 2018 controlling splash erosion also led to improve sscs patterns and volume and increase in ssr figs 3 and 4 tables 3 and 5 which consequently tended to the decrease in runoff generation and soil loss in this study the functionality of cyanobacteria decreased runoff and soil loss in the inoculated treatment at the rainfall event scale particularly in months of april to may 2018 because of suitable vegetation cover fig 7 and also appropriate air humidity and temperature conditions in light of our results the rates of cyanobacteria influence on runoff generation and sediment concentration were different so that the beneficial reduction of 35 25 31 33 46 47 and 57 in runoff and 16 34 36 2 13 4 and 49 in sediment concentration were observed for the first to seventh studied rainfall events respectively fig 3 tables 2 and 3 after a dryness period in the first rainfall event cyanobacteria were not able to reduce the sediment concentration due to unlimited sediment accessibility as confirmed by sadeghi et al 2016b and armenise et al 2018 antecedent soil moisture content at the second rainfall event reduced the ability of cyanobacteria in controlling runoff than sediment due to low soil permeability in subsequent rainfall events in the third and fourth events in the later rainfall the inoculated and control treatments had the same effect on sediment concentration whereas the effect of cyanobacteria on runoff reduction was more than on sediment concentration finally increasing of vegetation cover in the spring fig 7 concurrent with fifth sixth and seventh events had an influential role in reducing runoff and sediment from both inoculated and control plots in the control and inoculated plots the differences in ta index as vegetation cover indicator was not significant therefore the reduction of runoff and sediment generation from inoculated plots was only controlled by cyanobacterization it was also found fig 8 that despite gradual increase in population of cyanobacteria in the abandoned land inoculation of cyanobacteria could facilitate the initial stage formation of bscs at the end and in the defense of the positive role of cyanobacteria inoculation in controlling runoff and sediment generation the environmental impact and economic assessment of this newly introduced technique is essential before wide application although no specific focus was made on environmental aspects of the treatments in the current research a simple analysis showed that the inoculated cyanobacteria exhibited the least amount of transmission by runoff and sediment from the plots high tendency and capability of soil cyanobacteria to stick on the solid substrates prevent their easy transfer by runoff belnap 2006 despite some reports on the harmful effects of imported or introduced cyanobacteria to the soil i e bouaïcha and corbel 2016 and water i e manubolu et al 2018 there is no report on the adverse effect of soil native cyanobacteria on the ecosystems however insightful investigations into environmental impacts of high dense inoculated cyanobacteria on the ecosystems are strongly advised as the cost effectiveness is a key factor in the implementation of techniques soil inoculation by cyanobacteria was found to be an economically efficient and practically user friendly technique compared to some other common amendments e g biochar polyacrylamides manure and straw mulch with specific constraints of instability lehmann and joseph 2015 detrimental environmental effects woodrow et al 2008 and limited site accessibility blanco and lal 2008 fast low tech and inexpensive production and easy inoculation process are other advantages of cyanobacteria to be adopted for soil and water conservation in different regions 5 conclusion high runoff generation and soil loss on the bare and degraded hillslopes due to erosive rainfall in the wet seasons are among important environmental challenges in semi arid areas field soil inoculation with cyanobacteria at the end of the dry season lead to rapid formation of cyanobacteria crust and reduced runoff and soil loss the effect of 50 day time spanned cyanobacteria inoculation as a cost and time effective technique was shown for runoff and soil loss reduction to the respective tune of 57 and 36 it can be also roughly concluded from this study that the inoculation effects on runoff and soil loss were variable depending on antecedent soil moisture rainfall intensity duration and frequency air and soil humidity and temperature sediment source accessibility and vegetation cover it was further found that inoculated cyanobacteria reduced runoff and soil loss through preserving soil surface roughness improving soil crack patterns and volume increasing soil aggregate stability adhering soil fine particles together and covering soil surface inoculation of cyanobacteria was more effective for runoff and sediment reduction in winter inappropriate environmental conditions than in spring suitable conditions although self restoration of abandoned and degraded lands is possible after a longtime inoculation of cyanobacteria could be therefore supposed as a quick adaptable and cost effective strategy to use for drylands restoration by and large findings of this research somewhat attracted concerns regarding the field application of cyanobacteria inoculation after numerous laboratory studies however further investigations are needed about long term environmental impact assessments and application of cyanobacteria inoculation based technique in various temporal and spatial conditions to develop a comprehensive decision system for restoration of degraded lands credit authorship contribution statement seyed hamidreza sadeghi

5562,hydrological processes of floodplains in large river lake systems are subjected to strong flood pulses from catchment flows and lake inundations hydrological connectivity hc is one of the important characteristics of floodplains that can be used to provide evidence of mass and energy transport that influences the health of ecosystems and the biological productivity of floodplain water bodies this study used geostatistical methods in combination with remote sensing data 2000 2015 to investigate the hydrological connectivity in a complex river lake floodplain nanji wetland national natural reserve of the poyang lake floodplain which is naturally connected to the middle yangtze river the geomorphic characteristics of the study area were characterized by the connection of surface water bodies including rivers wetlands sub lakes and main lake results of this research indicated the apparent seasonal shifts of the dominant hydrological factors that affect the spatial temporal changes of hc in particular we find that the main lake stage plays a dominant role in determining the hydrological connectivity during the lake s flooding and receding periods we also find the existence of a threshold that causes an abrupt change of hc i e if the main lake stage is below this threshold the whole system becomes weakly hydrologically connected this threshold is related to the local topography but has ecological implications for the entire floodplain system the outcomes of this research provide an improved understanding of the hydrological behaviour of the catchment floodplain lake system considering the encountering of consistent drought of the lakes in the middle yangtze river this work may help clarify the intensity of the drought impacts on the ecologically important floodplains and also assist in optimizing the interactions between the lake and the yangtze river keywords hydrological connectivity remote sensing floodplain wetland poyang lake river lake system 1 introduction the floodplains of large river lake systems often contain complex networks of hydro geomorphic features including rivers lakes referred to as sub lakes in the remainder of the text and wetlands park and latrubesse 2017 floodplains also play an important role in connecting surface water systems riparian zones and upland areas and have critical functions in maintaining the health of rivers and lakes tockner et al 1999 amoros and bornette 2002 fuller and death 2018 a range of ecosystem functions served by floodplains e g water purification nutrient and sediment transport

floodplains and rivers has been evaluated using different measurement techniques and variables table 1 presents a review of the case studies of hc in floodplains during the last decade demonstrating that several quantification methods have been adopted to explore hc the review shows that hc in floodplains has been assessed using the results of a hydrodynamic modelling or field investigations b geostatistical analysis of waterbody extent from remote sensing data and c the movement of physical or chemical substances see table 1 examples of floodplain hc analyses include study by karim et al 2012 who assessed flood induced overbank hc using a hydrodynamic model mike 21 to calculate the timing duration and spatial extent of the hc between several floodplain wetlands and the main river in the tully murray catchment australia kupfer et al 2015 investigated the hc between the congaree river usa and the adjacent wetlands using a 2d flood inundation model tuflow the hc on floodplains has also been explored using geostatistical methods such as those used by trigg et al 2013 who evaluated an extreme flood event in the bangkok region thailand during 2011 trigg et al 2013 adopted a geostatistical connectivity analysis in conjunction with remotely sensed flood data from modis and the earth observing 1 satellite we follow the majority of previous studies in considering hc as only the surface transport pathways rather than the subsurface flow in this paper previous studies of the hc between floodplains and rivers have concluded that hc is mainly affected by one or several hydrological or geomorphic characteristics such as the rainfall flood magnitude and duration proximity to river channel and floodplain topography karim et al 2012 2014 2016 kupfer et al 2015 park and latrubesse 2017 these factors are interrelated for example rainfall influences local runoff which in turn drives the secondary channel connection between wetlands and the main river karim et al 2016 the interactions between climate floodplain topography and river hydrology create highly complex and dynamic connectivity processes park and latrubesse 2017 leibowitz et al 2018 however the large extent and remoteness of river and lake related floodplains across the world have resulted in limited field based studies inhibiting the investigation of hc and driving factors ovando et al 2018 li et al 2019b it follows that improving the understanding of data limited floodplains and associated processes controlling hc is warranted to aid in the assessment of floodplain environments and their

industries xia et al 2016 2017 shi et al 2017 2018 jin et al 2019 poyang lake has a distinctive hydrologic regime acting as a lake i e a largely horizontal water surface during high flood levels and a river i e area with a significant water surface gradient during low stage seasons zhang and werner 2015 li et al 2019a poyang lake is different from other floodplain systems due to interactions and temporal shifts between three hydrological systems namely the lake river and extensive floodplain areas zhang et al 2017 the time lag between the peaks of catchment inflow and the yangtze river discharge i e 1 1 5 months plays an important role in the tri modal phase of the poyang lake hydrology as do fluctuations in the main lake stage relative to the surrounding topographic controls zhang et al 2017 additionally the floodplains of poyang lake are subjected to changes in both the catchment inflow and the main lake stage as such the poyang lake floodplains are quite different from the riverine floodplains in most previous studies that are mainly influenced by river flow regimes and local rainfall karim et al 2012 2014 2015 several previous studies have attempted to investigate hc and its effects on ecosystems of the poyang lake floodplains xia et al 2016 2017 shi et al 2017 li et al 2019a tan et al 2019 for example xia et al 2016 in their investigation of the effects of hc on waterbidrs found that the hc within the poyang lake floodplains had a major influence on the habitat and food sources of migratory waterbirds the floodplain hydrology was directly linked to the vegetation dynamics and the growth of the aquatic species that form a staple component of migratory waterbird diets more recently li et al 2019a used a hydrodynamic model along with a geostatistical method to investigate the influence of hc on water quality trends in the floodplain sub lakes of poyang lake they concluded that hc may enhance the spatial similarity of water quality between different sub lakes while hydrological isolation i e low hc is associated with increased water quality differences between sub lakes similarly tan et al 2019 used remote sensing products in combination with the same geostatistical methods as li et al 2019a to analyse the spatial conditions of hc within the poyang lake s floodplains they concluded that hc between sub lakes rivers and the main lake is critically affected by floodplain inundation process which include channelized flow overland flow and overbank discharge previous studies around hc of poyang lake and the yangtze river mainly focused on 1 the hc type of floodplain sub lakes i e free connected controlled connected isolated and its effects on vegetation or waterbirds 2 the dynamics of hc of floodplains and its influences on inundation process or water quality however it is still unknown the seasonal change of hc and its influencing factors in complex floodplains affected by both the catchment flows and the strong seasonal variation of the main lake water level the seasonal change of hc among diverse geomorphic features matters because most floodplain biota survived in such circumstances by adapting to the predictable patterns of the seasonal hc in large river lake systems the interaction between river and lake was the dominant hydraulic force for the hydrological and ecological process of floodplains the relative timing of peak flows from the tributaries of lake catchment and the downstream of lake significantly affects the inundation process and seasonal characteristics of hc more importantly the seasonal characteristics of hc in poyang lake floodplains may be linked to its ecological functions e g maintaining vegetation growth sustaining stable habitats and food resources for migratory birds this is the primary purpose of the current research specifically the objectives of this research are to 1 analyse the seasonal characteristics and variations of the hc in one of the most important floodplain wetlands within poyang lake nanji wetland national natural reserve nwnnr 2 investigate the effects of the main lake stage and catchment inflow on hc across the wetland and 3 further explore the possible ecological importance and implications of hc this study is expected to improve the understanding of the floodplain system including the relationships between hc and ecology we expect that this will be beneficial to future wetland management strategies under changing floodplain environments and intensifying human interference 2 study area poyang lake is located in the middle reach of the yangtze river fig 1 the catchment of poyang lake has an area of 1 6 105 km2 and the elevation varies from 2200 m above sea level in the upstream mountains to approximately 30 m in northern regions of the catchment li et al 2014 there are five sub basins in the poyang lake catchment i e ganjiang fuhe xinjiang raohe and xiushui rivers the third order stream fig 1a the five rivers account for up to 90 of the total lake inflow lu et al 2018 li et al 2019c which were well monitored by the river gauging stations the monsoonal rainfall leads to considerable changes in the catchment inflows to the lake with monthly runoff averages varying between 1 6 108 m3 day and 7 4 108 m3 day during the period from 1960 to 2010 the average monthly lake outflow monitored by hukou gauging station see fig 1a to the yangtze river varied from 1 3 108 m3 day to 7 5 108 m3 day on average for the period 1960 to 2010 with some backflow events flow from the yangtze river into poyang lake during july to september li et al 2017 the poyang lake region poyang lake and surrounding areas an area of 23 830 km2 is historically a region of severe floods with 17 major flood events during the past decades li et al 2016a during the flood season may september the lake covers an area of 3800 km2 inundating the low lying alluvial plains surrounding the lake and along large rivers flowing into it shankman and keim 2016 a much larger area would be submerged during this period but for centuries most parts of the poyang lake region has been protected by levees an extensive levee system at the lake margins and along its major tributaries protects 10 million people from floods during the flood season shankman and keim 2016 this region protected by the levee system is under intensive cultivation and has a high population density while the study area of this paper is the poyang lake floodplains which was outside of the extensive levee system and inundated seasonally the population living in the poyang lake floodplains is estimated less than 6 000 and mainly concentrated on several islands within poyang lake the elevation of those islands is much higher than the flood stage of poyang lake which makes it possible to settle on those islands because of the dramatic changes in the inflow and outflow of poyang lake within a year the lake stage rises rapidly from march to july and declines beginning in late july the seasonal variations of lake stage ranged from 10 0 m at the hukou gauging station near the lake s outlet to 4 6 m at the kangshan gauging station consequently poyang lake varies considerably in inundated areas from approximately 700 km2 during the low water level periods to more than 3100 km2 during the high water level periods feng et al 2012 previous hydrodynamic investigations show that poyang lake appears to be a well mixing lake on a seasonal basis although thermal stratification may develop in the centre area and eastern bay of the lake during summer and early autumn li et al 2016b li et al 2018b the water velocity differences in depth profiles are generally less than 0 2 m s and the water temperature differences are smaller than 1 li et al 2016b most of the water depth within poyang lake is less than 6 m during flood seasons while the maximum depth can reach 30 m in the downstream portion of the lake s main flow channels li et al 2017 the flow velocities varied from less than 0 1 m s in the extensive floodplains to higher than 1 0 m s in the northern river channels of the lake modelling results also show that the residence times are less than 20 days in the main river and more than 300 days in the east part of the lake li et al 2015 the nwnnr is an important protected area within the floodplains of poyang lake fig 1a and b it is located in the south region of poyang lake n28 52 21 29 06 46 e116 10 24 116 23 50 and formed at the conjunction of the ganjiang river and poyang lake covering an area of 333 km2 the geomorphic features of nwnnr are quite complex as there are many river channels floodplain sub lakes mudflats and grasslands han et al 2018 the elevation of our study area varied from more than 18 m in highlands to lower than 8 m in deep flow channels and most of the floodplain sub lakes and mudflats ranged between 11 m and 14 m most geomorphic units e g river channels sub lakes and floodplain wetlands are inundated and form complex bathymetric features of the main lake water body during flood seasons june august li et al 2014 yao et al 2018 the surface water connection decreased and most geomorphic units are poorly connected during dry seasons december february tan et al 2019 the major vegetation types in the nwnnr include reeds e g phragmites grasses e g triarrhena lutarioriparia l liou carex cinerascens and floating leaved macrophytes e g trapa bispinosa roxb han et al 2018 in general the nwnnr can be classified into two zones in terms of the hydrologic and geographic settings 1 a wetland zone occurring within flat areas of lower elevation and 2 a sub lake zone that occurs at higher elevations that includes several regions of permanent inundation to significant depths fig 1b and 1d the sub lakes are of great importance to local fisheries and to migratory waterbirds xia et al 2015 2016 jin et al 2019 the sub lakes are ringed or partly ringed by low man made dykes which are beneficial for regulating the sub lake stages and water retention during the non flooding season finlayson et al 2010 guo et al 2014 the spatial variability of hydrological and wetland vegetation dynamics provides heterogeneous habitats in which migratory waterbirds can live and forage xia et al 2016 based on the investigations of the nwnnr during 2011 and 2012 the total number of migratory waterbirds varied from approximately 30 000 in january to 120 000 in december guo et al 2014 the nwnnr is the key node on the east asia australia waterfowl migration route for migratory waterbirds some of which are species listed as grade i national key protected animals e g the oriental stork ciconia boyciana the hooded crane grus monacha and the siberian crane grus leucogeranus xia et al 2015 3 materials and methods 3 1 bathymetric and hydrological data the bottom elevation of poyang lake was derived from a 1 10 000 map surveyed in 2010 by the hydrological bureau of jiangxi province the observed daily streamflows at ganjiang river the largest river of poyang lake were obtained to represent the lake inflow condition the daily lake stages of the three gauging stations i e at hukou tangyin and kangshan fig 1a were used to reflect the downstream central and upstream dynamics of the lake since the main river was inundated permanently throughout the year all lake gauging stations are located in the main river of poyang lake the observed daily meteorological parameters at boyang gauging station the nearest station to this study area fig 1a were selected to represent the precipitation condition of the study area all of the hydrological and meteorological data were derived from the routine observations of the hydrological bureau of jiangxi province 3 2 water quality data and vegetation classification water quality sampling was conducted at the main lake and floodplain sub lakes in summer i e july 2014 and in winter i e december 2014 and january 2015 surface water samples from a depth of 50 cm were collected with acid cleaned 1 l plastic buckets and kept cool and shaded prior to transport to the laboratory a total of 90 water quality samples were collected during the two seasons total nitrogen tn and total phosphorus tp concentrations were measured using a combined persulfate digestion ebina et al 1983 more details of the water quality data are described by li et al 2019a wetland vegetation classification in dry seasons were obtained based on remote sensing using object based image analysis tan et al 2016 in general groups of pixels at desired scale shape and compactness criteria were segmented into objects the segments were classified into categories of interest by supervised classification based on the sampling data in field survey finally individual plant species were merged into specified communities more information about the classification and accuracy assessment are provided in tan et al 2016 3 3 remote sensing data and water extraction the landsat etm and landsat oli level 1 t data 30 m 30 m were obtained from the usgs u s geological survey 2019 during the study period a total of 131 cloud free images covering the lake floodplains worldwide reference system path number 121 row number 40 were selected for analysis from the period between january 2000 and december 2015 fig 2 the landsat etm and landsat oli level 1t data have been calibrated using the best available radiometric calibration methods and typically have a geolocation accuracy better than 30 m chander et al 2009 therefore no further geometric correction was performed for the selected images radiometrically the selected images were first converted to top of atmosphere reflectance and then atmospherically corrected to produce surface reflectance using the flaash fast line of sight atmospheric analysis of spectral hypercubes module embedded in envi 5 3 software visible and shortwave infrared swir bands are often used for the retrieval of water surface data mcfeeters 1996 water absorbs much more light in the swir band than in the visible band which makes it different from other land cover types the water surface is easily extractable with an index such as the modified normalized difference water index mndwi the normalized difference water index ndwi the normalized difference vegetation index ndvi or the single near infrared nir band xu 2006 since mndwi is a widely used method for extracting the surfaces of different water bodies xu 2006 hui et al 2008 huang et al 2016 mndwi was employed herein to delineate the water bodies for the poyang lake floodplains the index can be expressed as follows 1 mndwi g s w i r g s w i r where swir is the surface reflectance in the swir band and g is the reflectance value in the green band xu 2006 once a histogram of the mndwi has been produced a threshold value is determined by otsu s histogram shape based method otsu 1979 to separate the water surface from its background the on screen digitizing method was used to quantify the accuracy of water extraction based on mndwi elsahabi et al 2016 specifically the reference map was generated utilizing careful on screen digitizing of water boundaries in landsat image band combinations using nir band red band green band in this study the overall accuracy and the kappa efficient in the extracted water areas are calculated and used to evaluate and analyze the accuracy of water extraction by mndwi three years i e 2013 2014 and 2015 were selected to validate the water extraction with the overall accuracy and kappa efficient in range of 85 99 and 0 71 0 99 respectively suggesting a satisfactory results of water extraction by mndwi 3 4 geostatistical connectivity analysis geostatistical connectivity metrics were used to characterize the hydrological connectivity of the nwnnr floodplains the metrics were multi point statistics based on binary state data that quantifies the probability that any two wet cells separated by a specified distance are connected pardo iguzquiza and dowd 2003 this geostatistical connectivity metric is effective for illustrating the connection or isolation between water bodies more importantly the index gives an accurate connectivity function value along a specific direction which is sensitive to flood extent trigg et al 2013 li et al 2019a tan et al 2019 the connectivity function cf expresses the probability that n points along a given direction are all valued above the threshold value zc journel et al 2000 as follows 2 cf n z c pr j 1 n i u j z c 1 where i uj zc is an indicator of the variable z uj at point uj that exceeds the threshold value zc defined as i uj zc 1 if z uj zc and zero if not and π is the product operator the connectivity function value cfv i e the value of cf n z c decreases as n increases where the value of the connectivity function at any given distance is the fraction of points along a given direction at that distance that are connected trigg et al 2013 in this study the geostatistical connectivity was calculated following trigg et al 2013 first the wet dry binary raster i e wet cells and dry cells was derived from the remote sensing images and the connected objects of the water bodies were identified using the label matrix function under the matlab software then cfv for the x axis and y axis directions can be calculated according to the definition of the connectivity function a simple illustrated example is presented in fig 3 and table 2 the analysis can use 8 way connectivity which allows cells to connect by edge and corner vertex 3 5 connection and inundation frequency the hc between the floodplains and the main river lake of poyang lake were assessed by the index connection frequency fcon which quantified the connection frequency between the floodplains and the main river through surface water pathways using the relation 3 f con n con n tot where ncon is the total number of incidents of hc between the floodplain and the main river ntot is the total number of images the water bodies were inferred from remote sensing images and used to quantify the number of incidents of hc between the floodplain and the main river channel of the lake in addition the inundation frequency of the floodplains fwet was calculated using the relation 4 f wet n wet n tot where nwet is the total number of wet cells of the floodplains higher fcon indicate better connectivity between the floodplain and the main river whereas higher fwet represents higher inundation possibility on the floodplains 4 results 4 1 changes in the water body distribution and hc the time series of the inundated area along with the main lake stage mls at the tangyin gauging station and the average cfv of the study area are shown in fig 4 mls has an obvious variation on a seasonal scale fig 4a the highest and lowest mls values during the study period 2000 2015 were 20 3 m and 9 6 m respectively fig 4a with the median value of 13 8 m the seasonal variation of mls was approximately 7 3 m on average for 2000 2015 the increased inflow from the upstream rivers drives the rising mls during spring and early summer i e from march to june rising water with the highest mls values usually appearing in early or middle july flooding water during the receding water period the mls declines from august to december due to the combined roles of decreasing catchment inflows and rapid lake discharges to the yangtze river generally 90 of the study area becomes inundated during the high mls while only 20 of the study area remains covered with water under low mls conditions thus 70 of the study area experienced an inundation event within a year the average cfv also showed an obvious intra annual change corresponding to the mls fluctuations fig 4c varied between 0 10 and 0 99 with the high mls i e 15 m or much higher during late spring and early summer i e march to july the average cfv increased to 0 80 0 99 due to a large water area and the high hc among the floodplain water bodies however a low mls e g 13 m or much lower was accompanied by a small water area leading to the average cfv below 0 5 reflecting reduced hc between the floodplain water bodies fig 4c fig 5 shows the distribution of water bodies under different mlss the water bodies were mainly distributed in the river channels and in some low elevation areas during low mls e g 11 m february 2 2014 fig 5a at higher mlss such as 12 m or 13 m fig 5b and 5c the area of the water bodies was larger than that under the mls of 11 m because the left bank of the main river was exposed during mlss below 14 m the eastern part of the floodplain was disconnected from the western part fig 5a c when the mls rose to 14 m both banks of the main river were covered with water connecting the eastern and western parts of the floodplains fig 5d g however most sub lakes remained disconnected from the main lake until the mls increased to 16 m the connectivity function curves cfc at different mlss are also shown in fig 5 generally higher values were obtained with higher mlss and vice versa as expected there are clear differences between the transverse w e and longitudinal n s direction cfc for the transverse direction the cfv decreased sharply with distance and finally reached zero at a distance of 7 km under a mls of 11 m fig 5a the cfc under mlss of 12 m and 13 m were similar and slightly higher than those under 11 m fig 5b and c those curves under higher mlss i e 14 m 18 m were aggregated and had high values implying an abrupt behaviour of cfc in the transverse direction fig 5d g the cfc in the longitudinal direction showed a different behaviour compared to the cfc in the transverse direction for example the cfc in the n s direction under the lower stages e g 11 m 13 m extended a longer distance compared to those in the w e direction fig 5a c due to the longer length of the water bodies along the longitudinal direction 4 2 effects of catchment inflow and main lake stage on hc the relationships among the hc catchment inflow and main lake stage are presented in fig 6 in general both the catchment inflow and main lake stage mls affected the hc where larger inflows and higher stages resulted in higher hc of floodplain water bodies during the first hydrologic phase according to zhang et al 2017 the catchment inflow increased greatly and resulted in both the rising lake stage and hc in spring and early summer fig 6a and b phase i the catchment inflow decreased abruptly in the second hydrologic phase because of the reduced rainfall after early summer in the catchment however the main lake stage remains as high as in early summer mainly resulting from yangtze river blocking effects hu et al 2007 guo et al 2012 and contributing to high hc in the second hydrologic phase fig 6a and 6b phase ii the hc declined during the third phase because of shrinking inundated areas which resulted from the small inflows and lowering stages fig 6a and b phase iii fig 6 clearly shows that the catchment inflow exerts more significant influences on the hc during the first hydrologic phase fig 6a phase i r2 0 35 than the latter two periods fig 6a phase ii and iii r2 0 17 because of the close relationships between catchment inflow and the main lake stage in phase i zhang et al 2017 we concluded that the dominant factor in the hc was the catchment inflow during this period which reflects the river force on the hc of floodplains of the river lake system the main lake stage has closer relationships with the hc during phases ii and iii fig 6b r 2 0 62 than the relationships between catchment inflow and hc fig 6a r 2 0 17 indicating the effects of the lake on the hc during hydrological phases ii and iii the catchment inflow was very small and the main lake stage declined from high levels to low levels which was mainly caused by the blocking effects downstream of the lake guo et al 2012 zhang et al 2012 overall the hc in the floodplains of the river lake system was influenced by the seasonal shift between catchment inflow and the main lake stage the hc in the w e direction and n s direction also showed different behaviours an obvious phenomenon was the disparity of w e cfv under lower mlss and higher mlss fig 6b and d a critical value of mls at approximately 13 8 m quite close to the median value of mls exists for w e cfv fig 6d when the mls was below 13 8 m w e cfv was lower than 0 3 when the mls was up to approximately 13 8 m w e cfv became higher with values larger than 0 6 compared to w e cfv n s cfv showed greater variation when mls was below 13 8 m fig 6b and d with values of 0 15 0 75 the distinct behaviours between longitudinal and transverse directional connectivity imply an underlying mechanism in water connection dynamics and the inundation process of floodplains in poyang lake which was explored in the discussion section 4 3 comparison between connection and inundation frequency the hc between the floodplains and the main river of poyang lake is an important factor for aquatic species migration and habitat conditions and thus plays a vital role in wetland management practises both the connection frequency and the inundation frequency of floodplains are plotted in fig 7 the spatial distribution of the connection frequency and inundation frequency were similar where higher values appeared at the main river lake and the floodplain wetlands nearby and lower values existed at the sub lakes fig 7 however connection frequency and inundation frequency showed dissimilar relationships regarding the different geomorphic features for example the connection frequency in the sub lakes was relatively low while the inundation frequency in sub lake centres was relatively high it is visible from fig 7c that the sub lakes had great discrepancies between connection frequency and inundation frequency while the other geomorphic features including floodplain wetlands and rivers e g the main river and floodplain rivers had small differences between these metrics suggesting a positive relationship between connection frequency and inundation frequency fig 7d also shows that the connection frequency and inundation frequency were aggregated along the 45 line for most geomorphic units except the sub lakes the sub lakes have a lower inundation frequency and connection frequency compared with the floodplain wetlands moreover the inundation frequency of the sub lakes was relatively high in comparison with the connection frequency implying water retention in the sub lakes mainly because of the saucer shaped bathymetry of the area fig 1d wu and liu 2017 most sub lakes have low to medium values of connection frequency varying between 0 1 and 0 5 while inundation frequencies varied from 0 2 to 0 8 5 discussion 5 1 hc differences along the river channel and the transverse direction the applied geostatistical connectivity method in the study area provided a chance to examine the relationships between the influencing factors and the hc in general the more frequently the floodplains were inundated the higher the hc value that could be obtained however the longitudinal connectivity n s and transverse direction connectivity w e exhibited different responses to the main lake stage mls the transverse direction connectivity showed a threshold behaviour where w e cfv changed abruptly around the median mls the longitudinal connectivity had a great variance under the median mls this abrupt behaviour was confirmed in the connectivity function curves cfc fig 5 in which the cfc in the transverse direction aggregated before and after the median mls the coefficient of determination for the linear fit line between inundated area and mls was 0 93 data shown in fig 4 indicating a positive correlation relationship between the two in this study consequently the spatial distribution of the water bodies is thought to be the main factor for this threshold behaviour in the transverse direction fig 5 shows the spatial distribution and connection of water bodies at different mlss the left bank of the main river was exposed at below an mls of 13 8 m fig 5a c mainly because of the higher height of the left bank fig 8 than during the 50 duration stage 13 8 m resulting in the disconnection of the west and east floodplains as a result w e cfv were lower than 0 4 the comparison between the longitudinal profile and water profile of the different durations indicated that the left bank height impeded the water connection between the river and floodplains when the mls was lower than 13 8 m 50 duration stage fig 8 when the mls was higher than 13 8 m i e higher than both banks downstream the west and east floodplains of the study area were reconnected fig 5d g and fig 8 obviously increasing the w e cfv 5 2 influences of surface connectivity on water quality hc has gained much more attention from environmentalists and ecologists than hydrologists because of its possible consequences on lake environments and ecology wang et al 2016 reported that the disconnection of most floodplain lakes from the main river was one of the main challenges faced by the yangtze river floodplain for example disconnection is one of the main causes of lake eutrophication the chlorophyll a content of phytoplankton in disconnected lakes is much higher than that in connected lakes wang et al 2016 this phenomenon has been ascribed to both the higher concentration of total nitrogen and total phosphorus and the water flow characteristics in the disconnected lakes wu et al 2014 wang et al 2016 for the poyang lake floodplains the water quality status i e total nitrogen and total phosphorous in dry seasons is worse than that in flood seasons for both the main lake and the sub lakes fig 9 that is the changes in surface water connection may play an important role in affecting the water quality trends of poyang lake as discussed by li et al 2019a when the lake stage was lower than the median mls most floodplains were disconnected from the main lake which impedes nutrient transportation and dilution liu et al 2016 wu et al 2017 5 3 influences of surface connectivity on wetland ecology sub lakes are different from floodplain wetlands in terms of the geometric characteristics and hydrological conditions as discussed in the results section the sub lakes have low to medium connectivity fig 7 which is important for lake ecology wang et al 2016 revealed that the species diversity biomass and production of macrophytes and macrobenthos reached a maximum at some levels of intermediate river connectivity high connectivity of floodplains means high flow from the main river and could result in scouring of organic matter silt deposition damage to vegetation carli and bayley 2015 low connectivity of floodplains may facilitate the settlement of terrestrial plants and decreased the biodiversity of floodplains in the poyang lake floodplains the wetland cover shows a greater species diversity in sub lakes compared to that in the floodplain wetlands fig 10 moreover the vegetation dynamics such as the start time and duration of the growing season are influenced by the hydrological connectivity of sub lakes shi et al 2017 2018 the floodplain wetlands near the main lake have a later start of growing season shorter growing season lower peak evi value and lower primary productivity compared to those of the sub lakes shi et al 2018 fig 10 consequently floodplain sub lakes have low to medium connectivity which is linked to the high biodiversity of poyang lake floodplains the sub lakes serve as important habitat sites for migratory waterbirds flying from the siberian plain xia et al 2016 2017 lei et al 2019 recent papers regarding migratory waterbirds have recognized poyang lake as the key stopover site on the east asian australasian flyway lei et al 2019 among the many environmental factors influencing the waterbirds population the hc plays an important role because it strongly affects the vegetation dynamics shi et al 2017 2018 and lake water environments li et al 2019a xia et al 2016 conducted a study on the effects of hydrological alteration on waterbirds using a generalized linear mixed model the results showed that the sub lakes with more natural connectivity accommodated higher bird abundance migratory waterbirds that feed on tubers sedges and invertebrate animals preferred the connected sub lakes xia et al 2016 the relationship between the hydrological isolation or connection and migratory waterbirds was also confirmed in a study of the crane species distribution during 2000 2013 huang et al 2018 which recorded four crane species abundance dynamics in the 38 sub lakes with varying hydrological connectivity the sub lakes with low to medium connectivity in the nwnnr had a medium value of crane abundance while the isolated sub lakes had the lowest values of crane abundance huang et al 2018 suggesting a significantly negative effect of connectivity on the herbivorous waterbirds xia et al 2017 huang et al 2018 the seasonal connection between the floodplains and the main lake is of great importance to migratory waterbirds fig 11 the higher hydrological connectivity during flood seasons is likely to facilitate the exchange of nutrients and the migration of aquatic biota on river lake floodplains amoros and bornette 2002 covino 2017 the sub lakes provide the foraging areas and refuging sites for migratory waterbirds during dry seasons xia et al 2016 2017 the floodplain wetlands adjacent to the main river were subject to frequent inundation or suffered from extremely low stages which is detrimental for hydrophyte growth and aquatic biota survival consequently both the inundation and hc influence the floodplains ecology the flooding and connection to the main lake in the rainy seasons provide the chance for cycling of the nutrients and the aquatic biota that inhabit the floodplains the floodplain sub lakes which are disconnected from the main lake during dry seasons support a relatively stable water environment that is beneficial for migratory waterbirds fig 11 5 4 data limitations and future research the geostatistical method used in this study demonstrated the successful utilization of connectivity analysis based on remote sensing data however because of the return period of the landsat sensor i e 16 days and the cloud disturbance on image reflectance the number of available images used in this study was 131 with an average interval of 45 days which limited the temporal resolution of the connectivity analyses despite the limitation the current study is capable of illustrating the seasonality of hc in lake floodplains using geostatistical method and landsat imagery with an emphasis on fine resolution 30 m 30 m satellite image based investigation of hc using geostatistical method can be applied in various floodplain settings in which hydrological observations are sparse and geomorphic features are complex in large floodplains water depth can also be regarded as an important element in the hc particularly for different aquatic species e g fish and mollusc communities reckendorfer et al 2006 karim et al 2012 however the current remote sensing approach cannot provide more details regarding the spatiotemporal information of water depth that is because landsat sensor obtains the optical signals from ground objects given these backgrounds future study should combine hydrodynamic modelling remote sensing and field measurement to explore the effect of water depth changes on hc in the floodplain system of poyang lake although the hydrological connectivity analysed in this paper was surface water pathways it should be noted that subsurface connectivity e g the subsurface flow between floodplain wetlands and rivers plays an important role in water quality and quantity li et al 2018a 2019d conant et al 2019 a study of the groundwater in poyang lake using field measurements revealed that there was significant seasonal exchange of surface water and groundwater with varying flux rates li et al 2019d while the highly dynamic hydrology e g obvious seasonal change of lake stage and the remoteness of the floodplains in poyang lake restricted the ability of sufficient investigation of the surface water groundwater connectivity yang et al 2016 the hc analysed in this study exhibits surface water connection based on landsat imagery however the surface water connection may be influenced by the groundwater discharge which wasn t monitored and modelled in this study area so far it has been suggested that establishing a field gauging network considering the surface water groundwater interaction would be timely which will improve the thorough understanding of hydrological connectivity in the poyang lake floodplains from the perspective of long term evolution erosion and deposition of sediment was a complicated process which may have influences on the hydrology of floodplain and also the ecosystem functions for example many studies show that the floodplain topography of poyang lake has changed due to the accumulation of erosion processes or human activities e g sand mining yao et al 2018 which in turn affects the lake levels and the associated surface water connection it is an urgent research area to consider both the connectivity and erosion process in future to better understand the complex floodplain behaviours 6 conclusion floodplains play an important role in maintaining the health of ecosystems in large river lake systems although several studies of hydrological connectivity have been conducted in riverine and lake influenced floodplains this study extended previous studies by considering the influencing factors e g catchment inflow lake stage floodplain topography of hc and its linkages to floodplain ecology by comparing the connectivity and inundation of the complex river lake influenced floodplains we expect to enhance the current understanding of the unique hydrological characteristics and ecological implications of poyang lake the current study demonstrates that the hc across the floodplains of the nanji wetland national natural reserve nwnnr poyang lake china shows strong seasonal variability due to fluctuations in the poyang lake stage and the rainfall runoff from the poyang lake catchment the main lake stage plays a dominant role in determining the hydrological connectivity during the lake s flooding and receding periods in addition the floodplain topography also controls hc the riverbank height hinders the surface water connection in the transverse direction below the 50 duration lake stage resulting in the abrupt change of transverse hydrological connectivity overall sub lakes or ponds on seasonal inundation floodplains are ecological refugia areas that are less likely influenced by the main lake regarding the surface water pathways in dry seasons wetlands adjacent to the main river or lake were the hydrological sensitive areas that have strong linkages to the water regime of the main lake considering the encountering of consistent drought of the lakes in the middle yangtze river this work may help clarify the intensity of the drought impacts on the ecologically important floodplains and also assist in optimizing the interactions between the lake and the yangtze river credit authorship contribution statement xinggen liu methodology data curation qi zhang

5562,hydrological processes of floodplains in large river lake systems are subjected to strong flood pulses from catchment flows and lake inundations hydrological connectivity hc is one of the important characteristics of floodplains that can be used to provide evidence of mass and energy transport that influences the health of ecosystems and the biological productivity of floodplain water bodies this study used geostatistical methods in combination with remote sensing data 2000 2015 to investigate the hydrological connectivity in a complex river lake floodplain nanji wetland national natural reserve of the poyang lake floodplain which is naturally connected to the middle yangtze river the geomorphic characteristics of the study area were characterized by the connection of surface water bodies including rivers wetlands sub lakes and main lake results of this research indicated the apparent seasonal shifts of the dominant hydrological factors that affect the spatial temporal changes of hc in particular we find that the main lake stage plays a dominant role in determining the hydrological connectivity during the lake s flooding and receding periods we also find the existence of a threshold that causes an abrupt change of hc i e if the main lake stage is below this threshold the whole system becomes weakly hydrologically connected this threshold is related to the local topography but has ecological implications for the entire floodplain system the outcomes of this research provide an improved understanding of the hydrological behaviour of the catchment floodplain lake system considering the encountering of consistent drought of the lakes in the middle yangtze river this work may help clarify the intensity of the drought impacts on the ecologically important floodplains and also assist in optimizing the interactions between the lake and the yangtze river keywords hydrological connectivity remote sensing floodplain wetland poyang lake river lake system 1 introduction the floodplains of large river lake systems often contain complex networks of hydro geomorphic features including rivers lakes referred to as sub lakes in the remainder of the text and wetlands park and latrubesse 2017 floodplains also play an important role in connecting surface water systems riparian zones and upland areas and have critical functions in maintaining the

floodplains and rivers has been evaluated using different measurement techniques and variables table 1 presents a review of the case studies of hc in floodplains during the last decade demonstrating that several quantification methods have been adopted to explore hc the review shows that hc in floodplains has been assessed using the results of a hydrodynamic modelling or field investigations b geostatistical analysis of waterbody extent from remote sensing data and c the movement of physical or chemical substances see table 1 examples of floodplain hc analyses include study by karim et al 2012 who assessed flood induced overbank hc using a hydrodynamic model mike 21 to calculate the timing duration and spatial extent of the hc between several floodplain wetlands and the main river in the tully murray catchment australia kupfer et al 2015 investigated the hc between the congaree river usa and the adjacent wetlands using a 2d flood inundation model tuflow the hc on floodplains has also been explored using geostatistical methods such as those used by trigg et al 2013 who evaluated an extreme flood event in the bangkok region thailand during 2011 trigg et al 2013 adopted a geostatistical connectivity analysis in conjunction with remotely sensed flood data from modis and the earth observing 1 satellite we follow the majority of previous studies in considering hc as only the surface transport pathways rather than the subsurface flow in this paper previous studies of the hc between floodplains and rivers have concluded that hc is mainly affected by one or several hydrological or geomorphic characteristics such as the rainfall flood magnitude and duration proximity to river channel and floodplain topography karim et al 2012 2014 2016 kupfer et al 2015 park and latrubesse 2017 these factors are interrelated for example rainfall influences local runoff which in turn drives the secondary channel connection between wetlands and the main river karim et al 2016 the interactions between climate floodplain topography and river hydrology create highly complex and dynamic connectivity processes park and latrubesse 2017 leibowitz et al 2018 however the large extent and remoteness of river and lake related floodplains across the world have resulted in limited field based studies inhibiting the investigation of hc and driving factors ovando et al 2018 li et al 2019b it follows that improving the understanding of data limited floodplains and associated processes controlling hc is warranted to aid in the assessment of floodplain environments and their management poyang lake and its extensive floodplains provide important ecosystem services e g vegetation growth waterbird habitat water quality purification and support significant local fishing industries xia et al 2016 2017 shi et al 2017 2018 jin et al 2019 poyang lake has a distinctive hydrologic regime acting as a lake i e a largely horizontal water surface during high flood levels and a river i e area with a significant water surface gradient during low stage seasons zhang and werner 2015 li et al 2019a poyang lake is different from other floodplain systems due to interactions and temporal shifts between three hydrological systems namely the lake river and extensive floodplain areas zhang et al 2017 the time lag between the peaks of catchment inflow and the yangtze river discharge i e 1 1 5 months plays an important role in the tri modal phase of the poyang lake hydrology as do fluctuations in the main lake stage relative to the surrounding topographic controls zhang et al 2017 additionally the floodplains of poyang lake are subjected to changes in both the catchment inflow and the main lake stage as such the poyang lake floodplains are quite different from the riverine floodplains in most previous studies that are mainly influenced by river flow regimes and local rainfall karim et al 2012 2014 2015 several previous studies have attempted to investigate hc and its effects on ecosystems of the poyang lake floodplains xia et al 2016 2017 shi et al 2017 li et al 2019a tan et al 2019 for example xia et al 2016 in their investigation of the effects of hc on waterbidrs found that the hc within the poyang lake floodplains had a major influence on the habitat and food sources of migratory waterbirds the floodplain hydrology was directly linked to the vegetation dynamics and the growth of the aquatic species that form a staple component of migratory waterbird diets more recently li et al 2019a used a hydrodynamic model along with a geostatistical method to investigate the influence of hc on water quality trends in the floodplain sub lakes of poyang lake they concluded that hc may enhance the spatial similarity of water quality between different sub lakes while hydrological isolation i e low hc is associated with increased water quality differences between sub lakes similarly tan et al 2019 used remote sensing products in combination with the same geostatistical methods as li et al 2019a to analyse the spatial conditions of hc within the poyang lake s floodplains they concluded that hc between sub lakes rivers and the main lake is critically affected by floodplain inundation process which include channelized flow overland flow and overbank discharge previous studies around hc of poyang lake and the yangtze river mainly focused on 1 the hc type of floodplain sub lakes i e free connected controlled connected isolated and its effects on vegetation or waterbirds 2 the dynamics of hc of floodplains and its influences on inundation process or water quality however it is still unknown the seasonal change of hc and its influencing factors in complex floodplains affected by both the catchment flows and the strong seasonal variation of the main lake water level the seasonal change of hc among diverse geomorphic features matters because most floodplain biota survived in such circumstances by adapting to the predictable patterns of the seasonal hc in large river lake systems the interaction between river and lake was the dominant hydraulic force for the hydrological and ecological process of floodplains the relative timing of peak flows from the tributaries of lake catchment and the downstream of lake significantly affects the inundation process and seasonal characteristics of hc more importantly the seasonal characteristics of hc in poyang lake floodplains may be linked to its ecological functions e g maintaining vegetation growth sustaining stable habitats and food resources for migratory birds this is the primary purpose of the current research specifically the objectives of this research are to 1 analyse the seasonal characteristics and variations of the hc in one of the most important floodplain wetlands within poyang lake nanji wetland national natural reserve nwnnr 2 investigate the effects of the main lake stage and catchment inflow on hc across the wetland and 3 further explore the possible ecological importance and implications of hc this study is expected to improve the understanding of the floodplain system including the relationships between hc and ecology we expect that this will be beneficial to future wetland management strategies under changing floodplain environments and intensifying human interference 2 study area poyang lake is located in the middle reach of the yangtze river fig 1 the catchment of poyang lake has an area of 1 6 105 km2 and the elevation varies from 2200 m above sea level in the upstream mountains to approximately 30 m in northern regions of the catchment li et al 2014 there are five sub basins in the poyang lake catchment i e ganjiang fuhe xinjiang raohe and xiushui rivers the third order stream fig 1a the five rivers account for up to 90 of the total lake inflow lu et al 2018 li et al 2019c which were well monitored by the river gauging stations the monsoonal rainfall leads to considerable changes in the catchment inflows to the lake with monthly runoff averages varying between 1 6 108 m3 day and 7 4 108 m3 day during the period from 1960 to 2010 the average monthly lake outflow monitored by hukou gauging station see fig 1a to the yangtze river varied from 1 3 108 m3 day to 7 5 108 m3 day on average for the period 1960 to 2010 with some backflow events flow from the yangtze river into poyang lake during july to september li et al 2017 the poyang lake region poyang lake and surrounding areas an area of 23 830 km2 is historically a region of severe floods with 17 major flood events during the past decades li et al 2016a during the flood season may september the lake covers an area of 3800 km2 inundating the low lying alluvial plains surrounding the lake and along large rivers flowing into it shankman and keim 2016 a much larger area would be submerged during this period but for centuries most parts of the poyang lake region has been protected by levees an extensive levee system at the lake margins and along its major tributaries protects 10 million people from floods during the flood season shankman and keim 2016 this region protected by the levee system is under intensive cultivation and has a high population density while the study area of this paper is the poyang lake floodplains which was outside of the extensive levee system and inundated seasonally the population living in the poyang lake floodplains is estimated less than 6 000 and mainly concentrated on several islands within poyang lake the elevation of those islands is much higher than the flood stage of poyang lake which makes it possible to settle on those islands because of the dramatic changes in the inflow and outflow of poyang lake within a year the lake stage rises rapidly from march to july and declines beginning in late july the seasonal variations of lake stage ranged from 10 0 m at the hukou gauging station near the lake s outlet to 4 6 m at the kangshan gauging station consequently poyang lake varies considerably in inundated areas from approximately 700 km2 during the low water level periods to more than 3100 km2 during the high water level periods feng et al 2012 previous hydrodynamic investigations show that poyang lake appears to be a well mixing lake on a seasonal basis although thermal stratification may develop in the centre area and eastern bay of the lake during summer and early autumn li et al 2016b li et al 2018b the water velocity differences in depth profiles are generally less than 0 2 m s and the water temperature differences are smaller than 1 li et al 2016b most of the water depth within poyang lake is less than 6 m during flood seasons while the maximum depth can reach 30 m in the downstream portion of the lake s main flow channels li et al 2017 the flow velocities varied from less than 0 1 m s in the extensive floodplains to higher than 1 0 m s in the northern river channels of the lake modelling results also show that the residence times are less than 20 days in the main river and more than 300 days in the east part of the lake li et al 2015 the nwnnr is an important protected area within the floodplains of poyang lake fig 1a and b it is located in the south region of poyang lake n28 52 21 29 06 46 e116 10 24 116 23 50 and formed at the conjunction of the ganjiang river and poyang lake covering an area of 333 km2 the geomorphic features of nwnnr are quite complex as there are many river channels floodplain sub lakes mudflats and grasslands han et al 2018 the elevation of our study area varied from more than 18 m in highlands to lower than 8 m in deep flow channels and most of the floodplain sub lakes and mudflats ranged between 11 m and 14 m most geomorphic units e g river channels sub lakes and floodplain wetlands are inundated and form complex bathymetric features of the main lake water body during flood seasons june august li et al 2014 yao et al 2018 the surface water connection decreased and most geomorphic units are poorly connected during dry seasons december february tan et al 2019 the major vegetation types in the nwnnr include reeds e g phragmites grasses e g triarrhena lutarioriparia l liou carex cinerascens and floating leaved macrophytes e g trapa bispinosa roxb han et al 2018 in general the nwnnr can be classified into two zones in terms of the hydrologic and geographic settings 1 a wetland zone occurring within flat areas of lower elevation and 2 a sub lake zone that occurs at higher elevations that includes several regions of permanent inundation to significant depths fig 1b and 1d the sub lakes are of great importance to local fisheries and to migratory waterbirds xia et al 2015 2016 jin et al 2019 the sub lakes are ringed or partly ringed by low man made dykes which are beneficial for regulating the sub lake stages and water retention during the non flooding season finlayson et al 2010 guo et al 2014 the spatial variability of hydrological and wetland vegetation dynamics provides heterogeneous habitats in which migratory waterbirds can live and forage xia et al 2016 based on the investigations of the nwnnr during 2011 and 2012 the total number of migratory waterbirds varied from approximately 30 000 in january to 120 000 in december guo et al 2014 the nwnnr is the key node on the east asia australia waterfowl migration route for migratory waterbirds some of which are species listed as grade i national key protected animals e g the oriental stork ciconia boyciana the hooded crane grus monacha and the siberian crane grus leucogeranus xia et al 2015 3 materials and methods 3 1 bathymetric and hydrological data the bottom elevation of poyang lake was derived from a 1 10 000 map surveyed in 2010 by the hydrological bureau of jiangxi province the observed daily streamflows at ganjiang river the largest river of poyang lake were obtained to represent the lake inflow condition the daily lake stages of the three gauging stations i e at hukou tangyin and kangshan fig 1a were used to reflect the downstream central and upstream dynamics of the lake since the main river was inundated permanently throughout the year all lake gauging stations are located in the main river of poyang lake the observed daily meteorological parameters at boyang gauging station the nearest station to this study area fig 1a were selected to represent the precipitation condition of the study area all of the hydrological and meteorological data were derived from the routine observations of the hydrological bureau of jiangxi province 3 2 water quality data and vegetation classification water quality sampling was conducted at the main lake and floodplain sub lakes in summer i e july 2014 and in winter i e december 2014 and january 2015 surface water samples from a depth of 50 cm were collected with acid cleaned 1 l plastic buckets and kept cool and shaded prior to transport to the laboratory a total of 90 water quality samples were collected during the two seasons total nitrogen tn and total phosphorus tp concentrations were measured using a combined persulfate digestion ebina et al 1983 more details of the water quality data are described by li et al 2019a wetland vegetation classification in dry seasons were obtained based on remote sensing using object based image analysis tan et al 2016 in general groups of pixels at desired scale shape and compactness criteria were segmented into objects the segments were classified into categories of interest by supervised classification based on the sampling data in field survey finally individual plant species were merged into specified communities more information about the classification and accuracy assessment are provided in tan et al 2016 3 3 remote sensing data and water extraction the landsat etm and landsat oli level 1 t data 30 m 30 m were obtained from the usgs u s geological survey 2019 during the study period a total of 131 cloud free images covering the lake floodplains worldwide reference system path number 121 row number 40 were selected for analysis from the period between january 2000 and december 2015 fig 2 the landsat etm and landsat oli level 1t data have been calibrated using the best available radiometric calibration methods and typically have a geolocation accuracy better than 30 m chander et al 2009 therefore no further geometric correction was performed for the selected images radiometrically the selected images were first converted to top of atmosphere reflectance and then atmospherically corrected to produce surface reflectance using the flaash fast line of sight atmospheric analysis of spectral hypercubes module embedded in envi 5 3 software visible and shortwave infrared swir bands are often used for the retrieval of water surface data mcfeeters 1996 water absorbs much more light in the swir band than in the visible band which makes it different from other land cover types the water surface is easily extractable with an index such as the modified normalized difference water index mndwi the normalized difference water index ndwi the normalized difference vegetation index ndvi or the single near infrared nir band xu 2006 since mndwi is a widely used method for extracting the surfaces of different water bodies xu 2006 hui et al 2008 huang et al 2016 mndwi was employed herein to delineate the water bodies for the poyang lake floodplains the index can be expressed as follows 1 mndwi g s w i r g s w i r where swir is the surface reflectance in the swir band and g is the reflectance value in the green band xu 2006 once a histogram of the mndwi has been produced a threshold value is determined by otsu s histogram shape based method otsu 1979 to separate the water surface from its background the on screen digitizing method was used to quantify the accuracy of water extraction based on mndwi elsahabi et al 2016 specifically the reference map was generated utilizing careful on screen digitizing of water boundaries in landsat image band combinations using nir band red band green band in this study the overall accuracy and the kappa efficient in the extracted water areas are calculated and used to evaluate and analyze the accuracy of water extraction by mndwi three years i e 2013 2014 and 2015 were selected to validate the water extraction with the overall accuracy and kappa efficient in range of 85 99 and 0 71 0 99 respectively suggesting a satisfactory results of water extraction by mndwi 3 4 geostatistical connectivity analysis geostatistical connectivity metrics were used to characterize the hydrological connectivity of the nwnnr floodplains the metrics were multi point statistics based on binary state data that quantifies the probability that any two wet cells separated by a specified distance are connected pardo iguzquiza and dowd 2003 this geostatistical connectivity metric is effective for illustrating the connection or isolation between water bodies more importantly the index gives an accurate connectivity function value along a specific direction which is sensitive to flood extent trigg et al 2013 li et al 2019a tan et al 2019 the connectivity function cf expresses the probability that n points along a given direction are all valued above the threshold value zc journel et al 2000 as follows 2 cf n z c pr j 1 n i u j z c 1 where i uj zc is an indicator of the variable z uj at point uj that exceeds the threshold value zc defined as i uj zc 1 if z uj zc and zero if not and π is the product operator the connectivity function value cfv i e the value of cf n z c decreases as n increases where the value of the connectivity function at any given distance is the fraction of points along a given direction at that distance that are connected trigg et al 2013 in this study the geostatistical connectivity was calculated following trigg et al 2013 first the wet dry binary raster i e wet cells and dry cells was derived from the remote sensing images and the connected objects of the water bodies were identified using the label matrix function under the matlab software then cfv for the x axis and y axis directions can be calculated according to the definition of the connectivity function a simple illustrated example is presented in fig 3 and table 2 the analysis can use 8 way connectivity which allows cells to connect by edge and corner vertex 3 5 connection and inundation frequency the hc between the floodplains and the main river lake of poyang lake were assessed by the index connection frequency fcon which quantified the connection frequency between the floodplains and the main river through surface water pathways using the relation 3 f con n con n tot where ncon is the total number of incidents of hc between the floodplain and the main river ntot is the total number of images the water bodies were inferred from remote sensing images and used to quantify the number of incidents of hc between the floodplain and the main river channel of the lake in addition the inundation frequency of the floodplains fwet was calculated using the relation 4 f wet n wet n tot where nwet is the total number of wet cells of the floodplains higher fcon indicate better connectivity between the floodplain and the main river whereas higher fwet represents higher inundation possibility on the floodplains 4 results 4 1 changes in the water body distribution and hc the time series of the inundated area along with the main lake stage mls at the tangyin gauging station and the average cfv of the study area are shown in fig 4 mls has an obvious variation on a seasonal scale fig 4a the highest and lowest mls values during the study period 2000 2015 were 20 3 m and 9 6 m respectively fig 4a with the median value of 13 8 m the seasonal variation of mls was approximately 7 3 m on average for 2000 2015 the increased inflow from the upstream rivers drives the rising mls during spring and early summer i e from march to june rising water with the highest mls values usually appearing in early or middle july flooding water during the receding water period the mls declines from august to december due to the combined roles of decreasing catchment inflows and rapid lake discharges to the yangtze river generally 90 of the study area becomes inundated during the high mls while only 20 of the study area remains covered with water under low mls conditions thus 70 of the study area experienced an inundation event within a year the average cfv also showed an obvious intra annual change corresponding to the mls fluctuations fig 4c varied between 0 10 and 0 99 with the high mls i e 15 m or much higher during late spring and early summer i e march to july the average cfv increased to 0 80 0 99 due to a large water area and the high hc among the floodplain water bodies however a low mls e g 13 m or much lower was accompanied by a small water area leading to the average cfv below 0 5 reflecting reduced hc between the floodplain water bodies fig 4c fig 5 shows the distribution of water bodies under different mlss the water bodies were mainly distributed in the river channels and in some low elevation areas during low mls e g 11 m february 2 2014 fig 5a at higher mlss such as 12 m or 13 m fig 5b and 5c the area of the water bodies was larger than that under the mls of 11 m because the left bank of the main river was exposed during mlss below 14 m the eastern part of the floodplain was disconnected from the western part fig 5a c when the mls rose to 14 m both banks of the main river were covered with water connecting the eastern and western parts of the floodplains fig 5d g however most sub lakes remained disconnected from the main lake until the mls increased to 16 m the connectivity function curves cfc at different mlss are also shown in fig 5 generally higher values were obtained with higher mlss and vice versa as expected there are clear differences between the transverse w e and longitudinal n s direction cfc for the transverse direction the cfv decreased sharply with distance and finally reached zero at a distance of 7 km under a mls of 11 m fig 5a the cfc under mlss of 12 m and 13 m were similar and slightly higher than those under 11 m fig 5b and c those curves under higher mlss i e 14 m 18 m were aggregated and had high values implying an abrupt behaviour of cfc in the transverse direction fig 5d g the cfc in the longitudinal direction showed a different behaviour compared to the cfc in the transverse direction for example the cfc in the n s direction under the lower stages e g 11 m 13 m extended a longer distance compared to those in the w e direction fig 5a c due to the longer length of the water bodies along the longitudinal direction 4 2 effects of catchment inflow and main lake stage on hc the relationships among the hc catchment inflow and main lake stage are presented in fig 6 in general both the catchment inflow and main lake stage mls affected the hc where larger inflows and higher stages resulted in higher hc of floodplain water bodies during the first hydrologic phase according to zhang et al 2017 the catchment inflow increased greatly and resulted in both the rising lake stage and hc in spring and early summer fig 6a and b phase i the catchment inflow decreased abruptly in the second hydrologic phase because of the reduced rainfall after early summer in the catchment however the main lake stage remains as high as in early summer mainly resulting from yangtze river blocking effects hu et al 2007 guo et al 2012 and contributing to high hc in the second hydrologic phase fig 6a and 6b phase ii the hc declined during the third phase because of shrinking inundated areas which resulted from the small inflows and lowering stages fig 6a and b phase iii fig 6 clearly shows that the catchment inflow exerts more significant influences on the hc during the first hydrologic phase fig 6a phase i r2 0 35 than the latter two periods fig 6a phase ii and iii r2 0 17 because of the close relationships between catchment inflow and the main lake stage in phase i zhang et al 2017 we concluded that the dominant factor in the hc was the catchment inflow during this period which reflects the river force on the hc of floodplains of the river lake system the main lake stage has closer relationships with the hc during phases ii and iii fig 6b r 2 0 62 than the relationships between catchment inflow and hc fig 6a r 2 0 17 indicating the effects of the lake on the hc during hydrological phases ii and iii the catchment inflow was very small and the main lake stage declined from high levels to low levels which was mainly caused by the blocking effects downstream of the lake guo et al 2012 zhang et al 2012 overall the hc in the floodplains of the river lake system was influenced by the seasonal shift between catchment inflow and the main lake stage the hc in the w e direction and n s direction also showed different behaviours an obvious phenomenon was the disparity of w e cfv under lower mlss and higher mlss fig 6b and d a critical value of mls at approximately 13 8 m quite close to the median value of mls exists for w e cfv fig 6d when the mls was below 13 8 m w e cfv was lower than 0 3 when the mls was up to approximately 13 8 m w e cfv became higher with values larger than 0 6 compared to w e cfv n s cfv showed greater variation when mls was below 13 8 m fig 6b and d with values of 0 15 0 75 the distinct behaviours between longitudinal and transverse directional connectivity imply an underlying mechanism in water connection dynamics and the inundation process of floodplains in poyang lake which was explored in the discussion section 4 3 comparison between connection and inundation frequency the hc between the floodplains and the main river of poyang lake is an important factor for aquatic species migration and habitat conditions and thus plays a vital role in wetland management practises both the connection frequency and the inundation frequency of floodplains are plotted in fig 7 the spatial distribution of the connection frequency and inundation frequency were similar where higher values appeared at the main river lake and the floodplain wetlands nearby and lower values existed at the sub lakes fig 7 however connection frequency and inundation frequency showed dissimilar relationships regarding the different geomorphic features for example the connection frequency in the sub lakes was relatively low while the inundation frequency in sub lake centres was relatively high it is visible from fig 7c that the sub lakes had great discrepancies between connection frequency and inundation frequency while the other geomorphic features including floodplain wetlands and rivers e g the main river and floodplain rivers had small differences between these metrics suggesting a positive relationship between connection frequency and inundation frequency fig 7d also shows that the connection frequency and inundation frequency were aggregated along the 45 line for most geomorphic units except the sub lakes the sub lakes have a lower inundation frequency and connection frequency compared with the floodplain wetlands moreover the inundation frequency of the sub lakes was relatively high in comparison with the connection frequency implying water retention in the sub lakes mainly because of the saucer shaped bathymetry of the area fig 1d wu and liu 2017 most sub lakes have low to medium values of connection frequency varying between 0 1 and 0 5 while inundation frequencies varied from 0 2 to 0 8 5 discussion 5 1 hc differences along the river channel and the transverse direction the applied geostatistical connectivity method in the study area provided a chance to examine the relationships between the influencing factors and the hc in general the more frequently the floodplains were inundated the higher the hc value that could be obtained however the longitudinal connectivity n s and transverse direction connectivity w e exhibited different responses to the main lake stage mls the transverse direction connectivity showed a threshold behaviour where w e cfv changed abruptly around the median mls the longitudinal connectivity had a great variance under the median mls this abrupt behaviour was confirmed in the connectivity function curves cfc fig 5 in which the cfc in the transverse direction aggregated before and after the median mls the coefficient of determination for the linear fit line between inundated area and mls was 0 93 data shown in fig 4 indicating a positive correlation relationship between the two in this study consequently the spatial distribution of the water bodies is thought to be the main factor for this threshold behaviour in the transverse direction fig 5 shows the spatial distribution and connection of water bodies at different mlss the left bank of the main river was exposed at below an mls of 13 8 m fig 5a c mainly because of the higher height of the left bank fig 8 than during the 50 duration stage 13 8 m resulting in the disconnection of the west and east floodplains as a result w e cfv were lower than 0 4 the comparison between the longitudinal profile and water profile of the different durations indicated that the left bank height impeded the water connection between the river and floodplains when the mls was lower than 13 8 m 50 duration stage fig 8 when the mls was higher than 13 8 m i e higher than both banks downstream the west and east floodplains of the study area were reconnected fig 5d g and fig 8 obviously increasing the w e cfv 5 2 influences of surface connectivity on water quality hc has gained much more attention from environmentalists and ecologists than hydrologists because of its possible consequences on lake environments and ecology wang et al 2016 reported that the disconnection of most floodplain lakes from the main river was one of the main challenges faced by the yangtze river floodplain for example disconnection is one of the main causes of lake eutrophication the chlorophyll a content of phytoplankton in disconnected lakes is much higher than that in connected lakes wang et al 2016 this phenomenon has been ascribed to both the higher concentration of total nitrogen and total phosphorus and the water flow characteristics in the disconnected lakes wu et al 2014 wang et al 2016 for the poyang lake floodplains the water quality status i e total nitrogen and total phosphorous in dry seasons is worse than that in flood seasons for both the main lake and the sub lakes fig 9 that is the changes in surface water connection may play an important role in affecting the water quality trends of poyang lake as discussed by li et al 2019a when the lake stage was lower than the median mls most floodplains were disconnected from the main lake which impedes nutrient transportation and dilution liu et al 2016 wu et al 2017 5 3 influences of surface connectivity on wetland ecology sub lakes are different from floodplain wetlands in terms of the geometric characteristics and hydrological conditions as discussed in the results section the sub lakes have low to medium connectivity fig 7 which is important for lake ecology wang et al 2016 revealed that the species diversity biomass and production of macrophytes and macrobenthos reached a maximum at some levels of intermediate river connectivity high connectivity of floodplains means high flow from the main river and could result in scouring of organic matter silt deposition damage to vegetation carli and bayley 2015 low connectivity of floodplains may facilitate the settlement of terrestrial plants and decreased the biodiversity of floodplains in the poyang lake floodplains the wetland cover shows a greater species diversity in sub lakes compared to that in the floodplain wetlands fig 10 moreover the vegetation dynamics such as the start time and duration of the growing season are influenced by the hydrological connectivity of sub lakes shi et al 2017 2018 the floodplain wetlands near the main lake have a later start of growing season shorter growing season lower peak evi value and lower primary productivity compared to those of the sub lakes shi et al 2018 fig 10 consequently floodplain sub lakes have low to medium connectivity which is linked to the high biodiversity of poyang lake floodplains the sub lakes serve as important habitat sites for migratory waterbirds flying from the siberian plain xia et al 2016 2017 lei et al 2019 recent papers regarding migratory waterbirds have recognized poyang lake as the key stopover site on the east asian australasian flyway lei et al 2019 among the many environmental factors influencing the waterbirds population the hc plays an important role because it strongly affects the vegetation dynamics shi et al 2017 2018 and lake water environments li et al 2019a xia et al 2016 conducted a study on the effects of hydrological alteration on waterbirds using a generalized linear mixed model the results showed that the sub lakes with more natural connectivity accommodated higher bird abundance migratory waterbirds that feed on tubers sedges and invertebrate animals preferred the connected sub lakes xia et al 2016 the relationship between the hydrological isolation or connection and migratory waterbirds was also confirmed in a study of the crane species distribution during 2000 2013 huang et al 2018 which recorded four crane species abundance dynamics in the 38 sub lakes with varying hydrological connectivity the sub lakes with low to medium connectivity in the nwnnr had a medium value of crane abundance while the isolated sub lakes had the lowest values of crane abundance huang et al 2018 suggesting a significantly negative effect of connectivity on the herbivorous waterbirds xia et al 2017 huang et al 2018 the seasonal connection between the floodplains and the main lake is of great importance to migratory waterbirds fig 11 the higher hydrological connectivity during flood seasons is likely to facilitate the exchange of nutrients and the migration of aquatic biota on river lake floodplains amoros and bornette 2002 covino 2017 the sub lakes provide the foraging areas and refuging sites for migratory waterbirds during dry seasons xia et al 2016 2017 the floodplain wetlands adjacent to the main river were subject to frequent inundation or suffered from extremely low stages which is detrimental for hydrophyte growth and aquatic biota survival consequently both the inundation and hc influence the floodplains ecology the flooding and connection to the main lake in the rainy seasons provide the chance for cycling of the nutrients and the aquatic biota that inhabit the floodplains the floodplain sub lakes which are disconnected from the main lake during dry seasons support a relatively stable water environment that is beneficial for migratory waterbirds fig 11 5 4 data limitations and future research the geostatistical method used in this study demonstrated the successful utilization of connectivity analysis based on remote sensing data however because of the return period of the landsat sensor i e 16 days and the cloud disturbance on image reflectance the number of available images used in this study was 131 with an average interval of 45 days which limited the temporal resolution of the connectivity analyses despite the limitation the current study is capable of illustrating the seasonality of hc in lake floodplains using geostatistical method and landsat imagery with an emphasis on fine resolution 30 m 30 m satellite image based investigation of hc using geostatistical method can be applied in various floodplain settings in which hydrological observations are sparse and geomorphic features are complex in large floodplains water depth can also be regarded as an important element in the hc particularly for different aquatic species e g fish and mollusc communities reckendorfer et al 2006 karim et al 2012 however the current remote sensing approach cannot provide more details regarding the spatiotemporal information of water depth that is because landsat sensor obtains the optical signals from ground objects given these backgrounds future study should combine hydrodynamic modelling remote sensing and field measurement to explore the effect of water depth changes on hc in the floodplain system of poyang lake although the hydrological connectivity analysed in this paper was surface water pathways it should be noted that subsurface connectivity e g the subsurface flow between floodplain wetlands and rivers plays an important role in water quality and quantity li et al 2018a 2019d conant et al 2019 a study of the groundwater in poyang lake using field measurements revealed that there was significant seasonal exchange of surface water and groundwater with varying flux rates li et al 2019d while the highly dynamic hydrology e g obvious seasonal change of lake stage and the remoteness of the floodplains in poyang lake restricted the ability of sufficient investigation of the surface water groundwater connectivity yang et al 2016 the hc analysed in this study exhibits surface water connection based on landsat imagery however the surface water connection may be influenced by the groundwater discharge which wasn t monitored and modelled in this study area so far it has been suggested that establishing a field gauging network considering the surface water groundwater interaction would be timely which will improve the thorough understanding of hydrological connectivity in the poyang lake floodplains from the perspective of long term evolution erosion and deposition of sediment was a complicated process which may have influences on the hydrology of floodplain and also the ecosystem functions for example many studies show that the floodplain topography of poyang lake has changed due to the accumulation of erosion processes or human activities e g sand mining yao et al 2018 which in turn affects the lake levels and the associated surface water connection it is an urgent research area to consider both the connectivity and erosion process in future to better understand the complex floodplain behaviours 6 conclusion floodplains play an important role in maintaining the health of ecosystems in large river lake systems although several studies of hydrological connectivity have been conducted in riverine and lake influenced floodplains this study extended previous studies by considering the influencing factors e g catchment inflow lake stage floodplain topography of hc and its linkages to floodplain ecology by comparing the connectivity and inundation of the complex river lake influenced floodplains we expect to enhance the current understanding of the unique hydrological characteristics and ecological implications of poyang lake the current study demonstrates that the hc across the floodplains of the nanji wetland national natural reserve nwnnr poyang lake china shows strong seasonal variability due to fluctuations in the poyang lake stage and the rainfall runoff from the poyang lake catchment the main lake stage plays a dominant role in determining the hydrological connectivity during the lake s flooding and receding periods in addition the floodplain topography also controls hc the riverbank height hinders the surface water connection in the transverse direction below the 50 duration lake stage resulting in the abrupt change of transverse hydrological connectivity overall sub lakes or ponds on seasonal inundation floodplains are ecological refugia areas that are less likely influenced by the main lake regarding the surface water pathways in dry seasons wetlands adjacent to the main river or lake were the hydrological sensitive areas that have strong linkages to the water regime of the main lake considering the encountering of consistent drought of the lakes in the middle yangtze river this work may help clarify the intensity of the drought impacts on the ecologically important floodplains and also assist in optimizing the interactions between the lake and the yangtze river credit authorship contribution statement xinggen liu methodology data curation qi zhang

5563,accurate water temperature forecasting in lake systems is important for environmental impact assessment and fisheries management among others in this study two models are developed and applied for water temperature forecasting in lake systems 1 the multi layer perceptron neural network mlpnn model and 2 the wavelet transform and mlpnn integrated model wt mlpnn the models are applied to forecast daily lake surface water temperature lswt of eight lowland polish lakes long term daily lswt from eight lakes and daily air temperatures from seven meteorological stations are used for daily lswt forecasting the results from the two models are compared with those obtained from two other widely used models the physically statistically based hybrid air2water model and a non linear regression model s curve the modelling results show that the air2water model performs the best followed by the wt mlpnn mlpnn and the non linear regression model overall the air2water wt mlpnn and mlpnn models reproduce well the seasonal and inter annual variations of the lswt dynamics in the eight lakes the non linear regression model although providing the lowest accuracy can still provide good preliminary estimates of the lswt for the eight lakes the outcomes of the present research can provide references for forecasting lake surface water temperature and sustainable management of lake ecosystems keywords lake surface water temperature air2water artificial neural network wavelet transform non linear regression polish lakes 1 introduction water temperature is one of the most important indicators of lake ecosystems it impacts many physical and biogeochemical processes in lakes choiński et al 2015 such as the reaeration process at the water air interface nguyen et al 2014 decay kinetics of organic matter catalán et al 2016 and nitrification reactions riley and stefan 1988 all the aquatic species have their own specific water temperature ranges for development and production studies have shown that significant variations of water temperature may bring serious consequences to the lake ecosystems beauregard et al 2013 for example elliott et al 2006 showed that water temperature affected phytoplankton communities in a temperate lake liu et al 2011 found that warm water temperature was the main factor impacting microcystis blooms in lake taihu jeppesen et al 2012 reported observation of profound changes in assemblage composition body size and age structure of fish species during recent decades with an annual water temperature increase of about 0 15 0 3 c per decade in 24 european lakes it is therefore of great significance to study the thermal dynamics in lakes lake surface water temperature lswt is impacted by various factors including solar radiation wind air temperature water inflow and outflow and lake morphology among others livingstone 2003 ptak et al 2018a the complex and nonlinear behavior of each of these factors and also in the interactions between among them makes forecasting of lswt a challenging task research over the last several decades have resulted in the development of many different models and their successful applications to lakes these models can be broadly divided into three categories 1 statistical models sharma et al 2008 czernecki and ptak 2018 2 hybrid physically statistically based models piccolroaz et al 2013 and 3 process based deterministic models riley and stefan 1988 hondzo and stefan 1993 weinberger and vetter 2012 the process based deterministic models are based on energy balance and they have clear physical meanings however they require a bunch of model inputs including lake bathymetry inflow and outflow conditions and a complete set of meteorological variables among others this requirement makes such models complex and limits their applications especially for lakes with limited available data to overcome this difficulty hybrid physically statistically based models have been developed a popular model in this category is the air2water model which requires only the air temperature as the model input this model is simple and it has been widely used to forecast lswt piccolroaz et al 2013 2018 2020 toffolon et al 2014 piccolroaz 2016 statistical models generally use the relationships between lswt and other factors in most cases the air temperature to forecast the thermal dynamics in lakes these models consist of simple regression models sharma et al 2008 artificial neural network ann models sharma et al 2008 liu and chen 2012 etc ann models have been widely used in hydrological and environmental studies with the development of artificial intelligence and computational capacity hsu et al 2002 dawson et al 2006 srivastav et al 2007 wang et al 2009 besaw et al 2010 chang et al 2015 gebler et al 2018 however their applications in lswt forecasting are limited sharma et al 2008 liu and chen 2012 let alone some advanced ann models e g wavelet transform and ann integrated model which have shown significant superiority to the traditional ann models in hydrological studies adamowski and sun 2010 adamowski and chan 2011 nourani et al 2014 graf et al 2019 to the best of our knowledge no researches have been conducted to evaluate the performance of the wavelet transform and ann integrated model on lswt forecasting in this study two models the multi layer perceptron neural network mlpnn model and the wavelet transform and mlpnn integrated model wt mlpnn were developed and applied for lswt forecasting the models were applied for lswt forecasting in eight lowland lakes in poland long term observed daily lswt and air temperature data were used the results from the two models are compared with those obtained from two other widely used models the physically statistically based hybrid air2water model and a non linear regression model s curve 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area and data in the present study eight lowland lakes in poland were studied fig 1 due to the impact of the last glacier about 12 000 years ago all these lakes are in the northern part of poland ptak et al 2018b fig 1 the morphologies of these eight lakes are presented in table 1 as seen the eight lakes have diverse morphologies for example the mean lake depth varies between 1 4 m and 15 5 m and the lake surface area ranges from 2 15 km2 to 98 51 km2 daily observed lswt data are available from 1987 to 2016 30 years for the above lakes in poland lswt is measured at a water depth of 0 4 m below water surface at 7 am at daily interval by the institute of meteorology and water management national research institute daily air temperature data were obtained from the nearest meteorological station fig 1 and table 1 the temporal variations of the daily lswt and air temperature time series for the eight lakes are presented in fig 2 the statistics of the lswt air temperature time series are summarized in table 2 as seen for the eight lakes the minimum lswt values are around 0 0 c the maximum lswt values are lower than 30 0 c and the average lswt values are around 10 0 c the average air temperatures range from 7 03 to 8 75 c for each lake the observed data were divided into two subsets one subset 2 3 for model calibration 1987 2006 and another subset 1 3 for model validation 2007 2016 in order to consider the time lags between daily lswt and air temperature air temperature of the most recent five days to the lswt observation were used as model inputs for all the four models considered in this study piotrowski et al 2015 2 2 multi layer perceptron neural network mlpnn model an artificial neural network ann is a powerful artificial intelligence technique that is able to handle non linear relationships and complex problems an ann architecture consists of three layers input hidden and output layers the input data is fed to the input layer and computation of weighted sum is performed then the data is processed in the hidden layer which can be converted to multiple layers depending on the complexity of the problem and finally the result is produced in the output layer moreover each layer is made of neurons which unite to form the architectural framework among all the ann types one of the most widely used models is the multi layer perceptron neural network mlpnn model the mlpnn model has three layers including an input layer a hidden layer and an output layer as revealed in fig 3 the input information are transferred layer by layer in a forward direction through the network neurons in different layers are connected through the adjusted values of weight factors each neuron is only connected with neurons in the subsequent layers each neuron sums its inputs and then generates its output using the available activation functions the ultimate objective of an mlpnn model is to develop a function of the following type 1 y o f x i where xi is the input variable which includes x1 x2 xi and yo is output variable which includes variables y1 y2 yo for lswt forecasting in the present study xi is daily air temperature and yo is daily lswt the function f is used to reveal the relationship between the model input e g daily air temperature and the model output e g daily lswt for the constructed mlpnn model the optimum number of neurons in the hidden layer was determined by a trial and error method the mlpnn model was trained using the popular levenberg marquardt algorithm because of its high accuracy and reliability adamowski and chan 2011 the mean squared error mse was used as the model performance metric in the model calibration phase for each mlpnn model run every calibration was repeated for 30 times and the averaged results were used early stopping was used to prevent overfitting in the present study the raw daily air temperature time series non decomposed time series were used as the input to this model more detailed information about the mlpnn model including details on the early stopping criterion can be found in graf et al 2019 2 3 wavelet transform and mlpnn wt mlpnn integrated model wavelet transform wt has been extensively used to analyze and de noise signals and images its applications in hydrology are also impressive chau and wu 2011 sang 2013 niu and sivakumar 2013 niu and chen 2016 sun et al 2019 based on the basis functions wt handles the expansion of functions compared with the classical fourier analysis fa wt expands functions in the form of wavelets rather than trigonometric polynomials the form of translations and dilations will be produced using a fixed function namely the mother wavelet the original data will be decomposed by wt into a scaled and shifted version of the mother wavelet namely the wavelets robertson et al 1996 the wavelet transformation can be subdivided into two sorts including the discrete wavelet transform dwt and the continuous wavelet transform cwt the traditional cwt method is time consuming while the dwt method needs less time and thus is easier to use adamowski and chan 2011 therefore the dwt method was used in this study to decompose the raw daily air temperature time series in this study for the dwt method a time scale signal was obtained using the digital filtering techniques high pass and low pass filters were used to process the raw time series data and finally the detailed coefficients and approximations will be produced using the wavelet algorithms gurley and kareem 1999 the two key points in the applications of the dwt method are selection of the appropriate mother wavelet and determination of the decomposition level as revealed by tascikaraoglu et al 2016 several types of mother wavelets are available in the present study one of the most widely applied mother wavelets namely daubechies at level 10 db10 was used according to seo et al 2015 the wavelet coefficients of db10 can help to capture the maximum amount of signal energy previous studies have shown that the db10 performed well for stream water temperature forecasting graf et al 2019 zhu et al 2019 in the present study the decomposition level was determined by the method used in nourani et al 2009 this approach has been widely used for water level river stage and river water temperature forecasting adamowski and chan 2011 seo et al 2015 2016 graf et al 2019 for this approach the decomposition level is determined by the length of time series data using the following formula 2 dl int log 10 n where dl is the decomposition level and n is the length of the air temperature time series the int function can be an integer down to the nearest integer in this study the wt method was used as a pre processing approach to decompose the original daily air temperature time series through which the approximation part a and several details d can be obtained in the next step the decomposed parts a and d of the original daily air temperature time series were used as model inputs to feed into the mlpnn model fig 3 the integrated model was named wt mlpnn more detailed information about the wt mlpnn model can be found in graf et al 2019 2 4 air2water model the air2water model is a simple lumped model for lswt forecasting using only air temperature as model input piccolroaz et al 2013 due to its simplicity and high accuracy it has been widely used for lswt forecasting around the world toffolon et al 2014 piccolroaz 2016 javaheri et al 2016 schmid and köster 2016 piccolroaz et al 2018 the air2water model is based on the volume integrated heat balance equation through simple linearization of the heat flux terms using taylor expansion piccolroaz et al 2013 and using air temperature as a proxy for the integrated effect of the relevant processes and fluxes livingstone and padisák 2007 piccolroaz et al 2013 the equations for the six parameter version can be obtained as follows piccolroaz et al 2018 3 d t w dt 1 δ a 1 a 2 t a a 3 t w a 5 cos 2 π t t y a 6 4 δ exp t w t h a 4 t w t h 1 t w t h where t is time ty is the duration of the year tw is lswt ta is air temperature th is a reference value for the deep lake temperature δ is a dimensionless number representing the ratio between the volume of the surface lake layer and a reference volume and a1 a6 are parameters which can be estimated through model calibration using the observed lswt data the reference value th can be assumed to be 4 c for dimictic lakes and the minimum or maximum water temperature for warm and cold monomictic lakes respectively piccolroaz 2016 detailed descriptions of the air2water model can be found in piccolroaz et al 2013 and piccolroaz 2016 the model source code can be freely downloaded at https github com marcotoffolon air2water 2 5 non linear regression model s curve mohseni et al 1998 proposed a non linear regression model for stream water temperature based on a logistic s shaped function which is given as 5 t w t μ α μ 1 e γ β t a t where tw t and ta t are water temperature and air temperature respectively and α μ β and γ are model parameters the four model parameters α μ β and γ can be estimated using the least squares method the criterion is to minimize the sum of the squared errors between the observed and fitted water temperatures mohseni et al 1998 while this model has been widely used in stream water temperature forecasting e g webb et al 2003 morrill et al 2005 zhu et al 2018 there have to our knowledge only been two applications for lswt forecasting roberts et al 2017 zhu et al 2020 2 6 model performance evaluation in this study three indicators were used to assess the model performance the nash sutcliffe efficiency coefficient nse the root mean squared error rmse and the mean absolute error mae toffolon et al 2014 graf et al 2019 the nse provides a normalized measure of model performance by evaluating the relative magnitude of the residual variance compared to the variance of observations nash and sutcliffe 1970 the nse has a maximum value of 1 0 and no minimum value nse equals to 1 0 indicates a perfect fit the rmse and mae values are used to represent the fitting errors the rmse and mae are always non negative and values of 0 almost never achieved in practice would indicate a perfect fit to the data in general lower rmse and mae values are better than higher ones these three measures are defined as 6 nse 1 i 1 n t m t o 2 i 1 n t o t av 2 7 rmse 1 n i 1 n t m t o 2 8 mae 1 n t m t o where n is the number of samples to and tm are the observed and modeled water temperature at time i and tav is the average value of to 3 results mlpnn model in the mlpnn model the optimum number of neurons in the hidden layer for each lake was found to vary between 10 and 13 the performance measures for the mlpnn model are presented in table 3 as seen the mlpnn model performed well for the lswt forecasting with nse value larger than 0 935 for all the eight lakes in 50 of the lakes the model performed better in the validation period with the nse varying between 0 961 and 0 983 average value 0 973 rmse varying between 0 983 c and 1 546 c average value 1 229 c and mae ranging between 0 760 c and 1 071 c average value 0 911 c wt mlpnn model in the wt mlpnn model the optimum number of neurons in the hidden layer was found to be the same as that of the mlpnn model for each lake table 4 summarizes the performance measures for the wt mlpnn model as seen the wt mlpnn model performed well for the lswt forecasting with nse value larger than 0 945 for all the eight lakes in the calibration phase nse ranged between 0 947 and 0 986 average value 0 974 rmse varied between 0 942 c and 1 686 c average value 1 176 c and mae varied from 0 723 c and 1 224 c average value 0 871 c for the validation period nse varied from 0 960 to 0 984 average value 0 972 rmse varied between 0 966 c and 1 565 c average value 1 234 c and mae ranged from 0 743 c and 1 109 c average value 0 908 c air2water model the parameter values a1 a6 and model performance for the air2water model are summarized in table 5 all the parameter values a1 a6 were found to be within the ranges reported in the study of toffolon et al 2014 as seen the air2water model performed well for the lswt forecasting with nse values larger than 0 945 for all the eight lakes in the calibration period nse ranged between 0 947 and 0 991 average value 0 978 rmse varied between 0 749 c and 1 682 c average value 1 069 c and mae varied from 0 582 c and 1 267 c average value 0 806 c the model performed equally well in the validation period with nse varying from 0 962 to 0 988 average value 0 976 rmse varying between 0 848 c and 1 527 c average value 1 141 c and mae ranging from 0 655 c and 1 032 c average value 0 849 c non linear regression model the performance measures for the non linear regression model are presented in table 6 as seen the model performed at an acceptable level for lswt forecasting with nse values larger than 0 850 for all the eight lakes the model performed better in the validation phase than in the calibration phase for all the lakes except for the lake rajgrodzkie table 6 in the validation period the average value of nse was 0 919 range 0 889 0 949 rmse varied between 1 573 c and 2 615 c average value 2 131 c and mae ranged from 1 213 c to 1 965 c average value 1 627 c figs 4 and 5 present comparisons of the performance of the four models in the calibration and validation periods using the box plots as seen in the calibration phase the air2water model performed the best with its performance slightly better than that of the wt mlpnn model the second best the wt mlpnn model clearly outperformed the mlpnn model and the non linear regression model performed the worst in the validation period the air2water model slightly outperformed the wt mlpnn and mlpnn models and performed far better than the non linear regression model overall in terms of their performances for lswt forecasting the four models can be ordered as air2water wt mlpnn mlpnn non linear regression fig 6 presents comparisons of the lswt forecasts from the four models in the validation period for the lake jamno in the form of direct time series left and scatter diagram right similar plots for the other seven lakes are presented in figs s1 s7 the results clearly indicate that mlpnn wt mlpnn and air2water models well captured the seasonal and inter annual variations of lwst in the eight lakes with high accuracies see fig 6 a c and figs s1 s7 however the results from the non linear regression model were with lower accuracies fig 6 d and figs s1 s7 the lake jamno is a shallow lake mean water depth 1 4 m maximum water depth 3 9 m and the results of the air2water and wt mlpnn models showed that these two models can accurately estimate lswt nse n 0 96 rmse 1 4 c mae 1 1 c indicating their applicability for lswt estimation in shallow lakes 4 discussion previous studies have employed the traditional ann models mlpnn to study the thermal dynamics in lakes sharma et al 2008 liu and chen 2012 some of these studies have also compared the performance of the mlpnn model for lswt forecasting with that of other methods for example sharma et al 2008 compared the ann model with multiple regression regression tree and bayesian multiple regression models for lswt forecasting using data from canadian lakes and reported that the ann model was marginally better than the others the results from the present study further indicated that the mlpnn model can be used to forecast the lswt dynamics when the model is properly trained the present study is the first one to apply the wavelet transform and the multi layer perceptron neural network integrated model wt mlpnn to forecast surface water temperature in lakes the results indicated that the wt mlpnn model performed slightly better than the traditional mlpnn model for lswt forecasting this result is also consistent with that reported by the previous studies on forecasting other hydrologic and environmental data such as stream water temperature graf et al 2019 groundwater level adamowski and chan 2011 and river flow adamowski and sun 2010 where the hybrid models showed evident superiority to the traditional ann models the better performance of the wt mlpnn model can be attributed to the use of the wavelet transform algorithm for pre processing the wt decomposes the raw time series of the daily air temperatures and the decomposed data improves the performance of the mlpnn model by analyzing useful information graf et al 2019 the air2water model was robust and accurate for lswt forecasting this model had previously been successfully applied for lswt forecasting in lake superior piccolroaz et al 2013 lake tahoe piccolroaz et al 2018 and 13 other lakes around the globe toffolon et al 2014 the results from this study further proved its reliability to forecast lswt dynamics in lakes compared with the above three models the non linear regression model performed the worst however values of the three performance indexes nse rmse and mae were all still within the ranges to those reported in the study by mohseni et al 1998 which analyzed observed data from 584 usgs river gauge stations it may be fair to say that the results from the non linear regression model for lswt forecasting in this study are generally acceptable therefore especially due to its simplicity this model can be used to provide at least some preliminary estimates of lswt as shown in roberts et al 2017 and zhu et al 2020 the main limitation of the air2water model is that except air temperature it does not explicitly account for the effects of external forces such as solar radiation wind speed and air humidity piccolroaz et al 2018 this limitation is embodied in the model

5563,accurate water temperature forecasting in lake systems is important for environmental impact assessment and fisheries management among others in this study two models are developed and applied for water temperature forecasting in lake systems 1 the multi layer perceptron neural network mlpnn model and 2 the wavelet transform and mlpnn integrated model wt mlpnn the models are applied to forecast daily lake surface water temperature lswt of eight lowland polish lakes long term daily lswt from eight lakes and daily air temperatures from seven meteorological stations are used for daily lswt forecasting the results from the two models are compared with those obtained from two other widely used models the physically statistically based hybrid air2water model and a non linear regression model s curve the modelling results show that the air2water model performs the best followed by the wt mlpnn mlpnn and the non linear regression model overall the air2water wt mlpnn and mlpnn models reproduce well the seasonal and inter annual variations of the lswt dynamics in the eight lakes the non linear regression model although providing the lowest accuracy can still provide good preliminary estimates of the lswt for the eight lakes the outcomes of the present research can provide references for forecasting lake surface water temperature and sustainable management of lake ecosystems keywords lake surface water temperature air2water artificial neural network wavelet transform non linear regression polish lakes 1 introduction water temperature is one of the most important indicators of lake ecosystems it impacts many physical and biogeochemical processes in lakes choiński et al 2015 such as the reaeration process at the water air interface nguyen et al 2014 decay kinetics of organic matter catalán et al 2016 and nitrification reactions riley and stefan 1988 all the aquatic species have their own specific water temperature ranges for development and production studies have shown that significant variations of water temperature may bring serious consequences to the lake ecosystems beauregard et al 2013 for example elliott et al 2006 showed that water temperature affected phytoplankton communities in a temperate lake liu et al 2011 found that warm water temperature was the main factor impacting microcystis blooms in lake taihu jeppesen et al 2012 reported observation of profound changes in assemblage composition body size and age structure of fish species during recent decades with an annual water temperature increase of about 0 15 0 3 c per decade in 24 european lakes it is therefore of great significance to study the thermal dynamics in lakes lake surface water temperature lswt is impacted by various factors including solar radiation wind air temperature water inflow and outflow and lake morphology among others livingstone 2003 ptak et al 2018a the complex and nonlinear behavior of each of these factors and also in the interactions between among them makes forecasting of lswt a challenging task research over the last several decades have resulted in the development of many different models and their successful applications to lakes these models can be broadly divided into three categories 1 statistical models sharma et al 2008 czernecki and ptak 2018 2 hybrid physically statistically based models piccolroaz et al 2013 and 3 process based deterministic models riley and stefan 1988 hondzo and stefan 1993 weinberger and vetter 2012 the process based deterministic models are based on energy balance and they have clear physical meanings however they require a bunch of model inputs including lake bathymetry inflow and outflow conditions and a complete set of meteorological variables among others this requirement makes such models complex and limits their applications especially for lakes with limited available data to overcome this difficulty hybrid physically statistically based models have been developed a popular model in this category is the air2water model which requires only the air temperature as the model input this model is simple and it has been widely used to forecast lswt piccolroaz et al 2013 2018 2020 toffolon et al 2014 piccolroaz 2016 statistical models generally use the relationships between lswt and other factors in most cases the air temperature to forecast the thermal dynamics in lakes these models consist of simple regression models sharma et al 2008 artificial neural network ann models sharma et al 2008 liu and chen 2012 etc ann models have been widely used in hydrological and environmental studies with the development of artificial intelligence and computational capacity hsu et al 2002 dawson et al 2006 srivastav et al 2007 wang et al 2009 besaw et al 2010 chang et al 2015 gebler et al 2018 however their applications in lswt forecasting are limited sharma et al 2008 liu and chen 2012 let alone some advanced ann models e g wavelet transform and ann integrated model which have shown significant superiority to the traditional ann models in hydrological studies adamowski and sun 2010 adamowski and chan 2011 nourani et al 2014 graf et al 2019 to the best of our knowledge no researches have been conducted to evaluate the performance of the wavelet transform and ann integrated model on lswt forecasting in this study two models the multi layer perceptron neural network mlpnn model and the wavelet transform and mlpnn integrated model wt mlpnn were developed and applied for lswt forecasting the models were applied for lswt forecasting in eight lowland lakes in poland long term observed daily lswt and air temperature data were used the results from the two models are compared with those obtained from two other widely used models the physically statistically based hybrid air2water model and a non linear regression model s curve 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area and data in the present study eight lowland lakes in poland were studied fig 1 due to the impact of the last glacier about 12 000 years ago all these lakes are in the northern part of poland ptak et al 2018b fig 1 the morphologies of these eight lakes are presented in table 1 as seen the eight lakes have diverse morphologies for example the mean lake depth varies between 1 4 m and 15 5 m and the lake surface area ranges from 2 15 km2 to 98 51 km2 daily observed lswt data are available from 1987 to 2016 30 years for the above lakes in poland lswt is measured at a water depth of 0 4 m below water surface at 7 am at daily interval by the institute of meteorology and water management national research institute daily air temperature data were obtained from the nearest meteorological station fig 1 and table 1 the temporal variations of the daily lswt and air temperature time series for the eight lakes are presented in fig 2 the statistics of the lswt air temperature time series are summarized in table 2 as seen for the eight lakes the minimum lswt values are around 0 0 c the maximum lswt values are lower than 30 0 c and the average lswt values are around 10 0 c the average air temperatures range from 7 03 to 8 75 c for each lake the observed data were divided into two subsets one subset 2 3 for model calibration 1987 2006 and another subset 1 3 for model validation 2007 2016 in order to consider the time lags between daily lswt and air temperature air temperature of the most recent five days to the lswt observation were used as model inputs for all the four models considered in this study piotrowski et al 2015 2 2 multi layer perceptron neural network mlpnn model an artificial neural network ann is a powerful artificial intelligence technique that is able to handle non linear relationships and complex problems an ann architecture consists of three layers input hidden and output layers the input data is fed to the input layer and computation of weighted sum is performed then the data is processed in the hidden layer which can be converted to multiple layers depending on the complexity of the problem and finally the result is produced in the output layer moreover each layer is made of neurons which unite to form the architectural framework among all the ann types one of the most widely used models is the multi layer perceptron neural network mlpnn model the mlpnn model has three layers including an input layer a hidden layer and an output layer as revealed in fig 3 the input information are transferred layer by layer in a forward direction through the network neurons in different layers are connected through the adjusted values of weight factors each neuron is only connected with neurons in the subsequent layers each neuron sums its inputs and then generates its output using the available activation functions the ultimate objective of an mlpnn model is to develop a function of the following type 1 y o f x i where xi is the input variable which includes x1 x2 xi and yo is output variable which includes variables y1 y2 yo for lswt forecasting in the present study xi is daily air temperature and yo is daily lswt the function f is used to reveal the relationship between the model input e g daily air temperature and the model output e g daily lswt for the constructed mlpnn model the optimum number of neurons in the hidden layer was determined by a trial and error method the mlpnn model was trained using the popular levenberg marquardt algorithm because of its high accuracy and reliability adamowski and chan 2011 the mean squared error mse was used as the model performance metric in the model calibration phase for each mlpnn model run every calibration was repeated for 30 times and the averaged results were used early stopping was used to prevent overfitting in the present study the raw daily air temperature time series non decomposed time series were used as the input to this model more detailed information about the mlpnn model including details on the early stopping criterion can be found in graf et al 2019 2 3 wavelet transform and mlpnn wt mlpnn integrated model wavelet transform wt has been extensively used to analyze and de noise signals and images its applications in hydrology are also impressive chau and wu 2011 sang 2013 niu and sivakumar 2013 niu and chen 2016 sun et al 2019 based on the basis functions wt handles the expansion of functions compared with the classical fourier analysis fa wt expands functions in the form of wavelets rather than trigonometric polynomials the form of translations and dilations will be produced using a fixed function namely the mother wavelet the original data will be decomposed by wt into a scaled and shifted version of the mother wavelet namely the wavelets robertson et al 1996 the wavelet transformation can be subdivided into two sorts including the discrete wavelet transform dwt and the continuous wavelet transform cwt the traditional cwt method is time consuming while the dwt method needs less time and thus is easier to use adamowski and chan 2011 therefore the dwt method was used in this study to decompose the raw daily air temperature time series in this study for the dwt method a time scale signal was obtained using the digital filtering techniques high pass and low pass filters were used to process the raw time series data and finally the detailed coefficients and approximations will be produced using the wavelet algorithms gurley and kareem 1999 the two key points in the applications of the dwt method are selection of the appropriate mother wavelet and determination of the decomposition level as revealed by tascikaraoglu et al 2016 several types of mother wavelets are available in the present study one of the most widely applied mother wavelets namely daubechies at level 10 db10 was used according to seo et al 2015 the wavelet coefficients of db10 can help to capture the maximum amount of signal energy previous studies have shown that the db10 performed well for stream water temperature forecasting graf et al 2019 zhu et al 2019 in the present study the decomposition level was determined by the method used in nourani et al 2009 this approach has been widely used for water level river stage and river water temperature forecasting adamowski and chan 2011 seo et al 2015 2016 graf et al 2019 for this approach the decomposition level is determined by the length of time series data using the following formula 2 dl int log 10 n where dl is the decomposition level and n is the length of the air temperature time series the int function can be an integer down to the nearest integer in this study the wt method was used as a pre processing approach to decompose the original daily air temperature time series through which the approximation part a and several details d can be obtained in the next step the decomposed parts a and d of the original daily air temperature time series were used as model inputs to feed into the mlpnn model fig 3 the integrated model was named wt mlpnn more detailed information about the wt mlpnn model can be found in graf et al 2019 2 4 air2water model the air2water model is a simple lumped model for lswt forecasting using only air temperature as model input piccolroaz et al 2013 due to its simplicity and high accuracy it has been widely used for lswt forecasting around the world toffolon et al 2014 piccolroaz 2016 javaheri et al 2016 schmid and köster 2016 piccolroaz et al 2018 the air2water model is based on the volume integrated heat balance equation through simple linearization of the heat flux terms using taylor expansion piccolroaz et al 2013 and using air temperature as a proxy for the integrated effect of the relevant processes and fluxes livingstone and padisák 2007 piccolroaz et al 2013 the equations for the six parameter version can be obtained as follows piccolroaz et al 2018 3 d t w dt 1 δ a 1 a 2 t a a 3 t w a 5 cos 2 π t t y a 6 4 δ exp t w t h a 4 t w t h 1 t w t h where t is time ty is the duration of the year tw is lswt ta is air temperature th is a reference value for the deep lake temperature δ is a dimensionless number representing the ratio between the volume of the surface lake layer and a reference volume and a1 a6 are parameters which can be estimated through model calibration using the observed lswt data the reference value th can be assumed to be 4 c for dimictic lakes and the minimum or maximum water temperature for warm and cold monomictic lakes respectively piccolroaz 2016 detailed descriptions of the air2water model can be found in piccolroaz et al 2013 and piccolroaz 2016 the model source code can be freely downloaded at https github com marcotoffolon air2water 2 5 non linear regression model s curve mohseni et al 1998 proposed a non linear regression model for stream water temperature based on a logistic s shaped function which is given as 5 t w t μ α μ 1 e γ β t a t where tw t and ta t are water temperature and air temperature respectively and α μ β and γ are model parameters the four model parameters α μ β and γ can be estimated using the least squares method the criterion is to minimize the sum of the squared errors between the observed and fitted water temperatures mohseni et al 1998 while this model has been widely used in stream water temperature forecasting e g webb et al 2003 morrill et al 2005 zhu et al 2018 there have to our knowledge only been two applications for lswt forecasting roberts et al 2017 zhu et al 2020 2 6 model performance evaluation in this study three indicators were used to assess the model performance the nash sutcliffe efficiency coefficient nse the root mean squared error rmse and the mean absolute error mae toffolon et al 2014 graf et al 2019 the nse provides a normalized measure of model performance by evaluating the relative magnitude of the residual variance compared to the variance of observations nash and sutcliffe 1970 the nse has a maximum value of 1 0 and no minimum value nse equals to 1 0 indicates a perfect fit the rmse and mae values are used to represent the fitting errors the rmse and mae are always non negative and values of 0 almost never achieved in practice would indicate a perfect fit to the data in general lower rmse and mae values are better than higher ones these three measures are defined as 6 nse 1 i 1 n t m t o 2 i 1 n t o t av 2 7 rmse 1 n i 1 n t m t o 2 8 mae 1 n t m t o where n is the number of samples to and tm are the observed and modeled water temperature at time i and tav is the average value of to 3 results mlpnn model in the mlpnn model the optimum number of neurons in the hidden layer for each lake was found to vary between 10 and 13 the performance measures for the mlpnn model are presented in table 3 as seen the mlpnn model performed well for the lswt forecasting with nse value larger than 0 935 for all the eight lakes in 50 of the lakes the model performed better in the validation period with the nse varying between 0 961 and 0 983 average value 0 973 rmse varying between 0 983 c and 1 546 c average value 1 229 c and mae ranging between 0 760 c and 1 071 c average value 0 911 c wt mlpnn model in the wt mlpnn model the optimum number of neurons in the hidden layer was found to be the same as that of the mlpnn model for each lake table 4 summarizes the performance measures for the wt mlpnn model as seen the wt mlpnn model performed well for the lswt forecasting with nse value larger than 0 945 for all the eight lakes in the calibration phase nse ranged between 0 947 and 0 986 average value 0 974 rmse varied between 0 942 c and 1 686 c average value 1 176 c and mae varied from 0 723 c and 1 224 c average value 0 871 c for the validation period nse varied from 0 960 to 0 984 average value 0 972 rmse varied between 0 966 c and 1 565 c average value 1 234 c and mae ranged from 0 743 c and 1 109 c average value 0 908 c air2water model the parameter values a1 a6 and model performance for the air2water model are summarized in table 5 all the parameter values a1 a6 were found to be within the ranges reported in the study of toffolon et al 2014 as seen the air2water model performed well for the lswt forecasting with nse values larger than 0 945 for all the eight lakes in the calibration period nse ranged between 0 947 and 0 991 average value 0 978 rmse varied between 0 749 c and 1 682 c average value 1 069 c and mae varied from 0 582 c and 1 267 c average value 0 806 c the model performed equally well in the validation period with nse varying from 0 962 to 0 988 average value 0 976 rmse varying between 0 848 c and 1 527 c average value 1 141 c and mae ranging from 0 655 c and 1 032 c average value 0 849 c non linear regression model the performance measures for the non linear regression model are presented in table 6 as seen the model performed at an acceptable level for lswt forecasting with nse values larger than 0 850 for all the eight lakes the model performed better in the validation phase than in the calibration phase for all the lakes except for the lake rajgrodzkie table 6 in the validation period the average value of nse was 0 919 range 0 889 0 949 rmse varied between 1 573 c and 2 615 c average value 2 131 c and mae ranged from 1 213 c to 1 965 c average value 1 627 c figs 4 and 5 present comparisons of the performance of the four models in the calibration and validation periods using the box plots as seen in the calibration phase the air2water model performed the best with its performance slightly better than that of the wt mlpnn model the second best the wt mlpnn model clearly outperformed the mlpnn model and the non linear regression model performed the worst in the validation period the air2water model slightly outperformed the wt mlpnn and mlpnn models and performed far better than the non linear regression model overall in terms of their performances for lswt forecasting the four models can be ordered as air2water wt mlpnn mlpnn non linear regression fig 6 presents comparisons of the lswt forecasts from the four models in the validation period for the lake jamno in the form of direct time series left and scatter diagram right similar plots for the other seven lakes are presented in figs s1 s7 the results clearly indicate that mlpnn wt mlpnn and air2water models well captured the seasonal and inter annual variations of lwst in the eight lakes with high accuracies see fig 6 a c and figs s1 s7 however the results from the non linear regression model were with lower accuracies fig 6 d and figs s1 s7 the lake jamno is a shallow lake mean water depth 1 4 m maximum water depth 3 9 m and the results of the air2water and wt mlpnn models showed that these two models can accurately estimate lswt nse n 0 96 rmse 1 4 c mae 1 1 c indicating their applicability for lswt estimation in shallow lakes 4 discussion previous studies have employed the traditional ann models mlpnn to study the thermal dynamics in lakes sharma et al 2008 liu and chen 2012 some of these studies have also compared the performance of the mlpnn model for lswt forecasting with that of other methods for example sharma et al 2008 compared the ann model with multiple regression regression tree and bayesian multiple regression models for lswt forecasting using data from canadian lakes and reported that the ann model was marginally better than the others the results from the present study further indicated that the mlpnn model can be used to forecast the lswt dynamics when the model is properly trained the present study is the first one to apply the wavelet transform and the multi layer perceptron neural network integrated model wt mlpnn to forecast surface water temperature in lakes the results indicated that the wt mlpnn model performed slightly better than the traditional mlpnn model for lswt forecasting this result is also consistent with that reported by the previous studies on forecasting other hydrologic and environmental data such as stream water temperature graf et al 2019 groundwater level adamowski and chan 2011 and river flow adamowski and sun 2010 where the hybrid models showed evident superiority to the traditional ann models the better performance of the wt mlpnn model can be attributed to the use of the wavelet transform algorithm for pre processing the wt decomposes the raw time series of the daily air temperatures and the decomposed data improves the performance of the mlpnn model by analyzing useful information graf et al 2019 the air2water model was robust and accurate for lswt forecasting this model had previously been successfully applied for lswt forecasting in lake superior piccolroaz et al 2013 lake tahoe piccolroaz et al 2018 and 13 other lakes around the globe toffolon et al 2014 the results from this study further proved its reliability to forecast lswt dynamics in lakes compared with the above three models the non linear regression model performed the worst however values of the three performance indexes nse rmse and mae were all still within the ranges to those reported in the study by mohseni et al 1998 which analyzed observed data from 584 usgs river gauge stations it may be fair to say that the results from the non linear regression model for lswt forecasting in this study are generally acceptable therefore especially due to its simplicity this model can be used to provide at least some preliminary estimates of lswt as shown in roberts et al 2017 and zhu et al 2020 the main limitation of the air2water model is that except air temperature it does not explicitly account for the effects of external forces such as solar radiation wind speed and air humidity piccolroaz et al 2018 this limitation is embodied in the model structure however for the mlpnn and the hybrid wt mlpnn models this will not be a problem since the model inputs are only determined by data availability in our future research we will further refine the mlpnn and wt mlpnn models using more available meteorological variables e g solar radiation wind speed and air humidity as model inputs to assess the impacts of these variables on lswt forecasting the outcomes of the present study have important implications for forecasting water temperature in lakes especially from the viewpoint of coupling integrating wavelets and anns in particular and different time series data based methods in hydrological times series studies more broadly 5 conclusions in this study two models are developed and applied for water temperature forecasting in lake systems 1 the multi layer perceptron neural network mlpnn model and 2 the wavelet transform and mlpnn integrated model wt mlpnn the models are applied to forecast daily lake surface water temperature lswt of eight lowland polish lakes long term daily lswt from eight lakes and daily air temperatures from seven meteorological stations are used for daily lswt forecasting the results from the two models are compared with those obtained from two other widely used models the physically statistically based hybrid air2water model and a non linear regression model s curve the results lead to the following conclusions 1 the traditional mlpnn model average nse 0 970 rmse 1 266 c and mae 0 937 c significantly outperformed the non linear regression model average nse 0 908 rmse 2 253 c and mae 1

5564,the global warming and climate changes determined a considerable increase in the frequency of floods and their related damages therefore the high accuracy prediction of flood susceptible areas plays a key role in flood warnings and risk reduction the main objective of this study is to propose novel hybridizations of fuzzy analytical hierarchy process fahp index of entropy ioe and support vector machine svm for predicting the areas susceptible to floods buzău river catchment romania was the area on which the present study was focused in this regard a database with 205 flooded locations 205 non flood locations and 12 flood predictors was established and used to train and validate the flood susceptibility models the performance of the proposed models was evaluated using the receiver operating characteristic roc curve and statistical metrics the results show that all the hybrid models have a high prediction performance and outperform the stand alone models among them the svm ioe model auc 0 979 has the highest performance followed by the fahp ioe auc 0 97 ioe auc 0 969 svm auc 0 966 and fahp auc 0 947 these results highlight a very high efficiency of all the applied models the application of the models mentioned above revealed that a percentage between 12 5 fpiioe and 21 2 fpifahp of the study area is characterized by high and very high exposure to these hydrological hazards keywords environmental modeling flood hybridization fuzzy analytical hierarchy process index of entropy support vector machine 1 introduction floods are natural risk phenomena causing severe damages to the environment loss of human life determining a slowdown of the economic development of many areas across the world it is increasingly evident that the overall frequency of major flood events will increase over the next few years this fact being directly connected with the global climate changes spence et al 2011 this higher frequency and severity of the flood phenomena will inevitably cause exponential growth in terms of economic damage and loss of human life jongman 2018 globally each year the floods are responsible for economic losses totaling over 20 billion and more for than 3000 casualties nicklin et al 2019 in europe the damages caused by floods are expected to increase five times until the year 2050 and 17 times until the year 2080 european environment agency 2017 romania is one of the most flood affected european countries costache 2019a throughout the 20th and early 21st century numerous areas across romania were affected by historical floods such as those occurring in the years 1912 1932 1969 1970 2005 2006 and 2010 grecu et al 2017 annually in romania floods cause material losses of over 100 million euros with the accession to the european union in 2007 romania was forced to align the directives of the european parliament such as the directive 2007 60 ec the activities related to flood risk management are included in this directive floods occurrence is difficult to prevent and their devastating effects are often amplified by certain human activities minea et al 2019 and also by climate changes however certain measures undertaken by the responsible authorities can significantly decrease the amount of damage produced by the floods and also can reduce the loss of human life at the base of all measures intended to reduce the flood vulnerability is the identification of the areas with a high risk to these types of natural hazards one of the methods used to quantify the areas susceptible to severe flooding is the hydraulic modeling through which the floodplain extent is directly related to certain discharge values with different probabilities of exceedance nevertheless the hydraulic modeling is time consuming and also the necessary data like a digital elevation model at a high resolution are expensive during the last years many state of the art methods with the ability to integrate the flood predictors into a gis environment were frequently used in the studies related to the flood susceptibility assessment ahmadlou et al 2018 costache et al 2019b costache and bui 2019 mahmoud and gan 2018 tien bui et al 2019 costache and prăvălie 2012 also the role of certain flood predictors on the accumulation of water at the soil surface can be quantified thus the most widely used models in the category of bivariate statistics are statistical index certainty factor frequency ratio index of entropy and weights of evidence costache and zaharia 2017 khosravi et al 2016 kumar samanta et al 2018 tehrany et al 2013 machine learning algorithms are represented by the models like artificial neural networks support vector machine logistic regression adaptive neuro fuzzy inference system and decision trees arabameri et al 2019 choubin et al 2019 costache 2019b 2019c dou et al 2019 hong et al 2018 mojaddadi et al 2017 tehrany et al 2014 tien bui et al 2016 wang et al 2019 wang et al 2015 the hybrid methods formed by combining two or more stand alone models are considered more advanced providing much more accurate results a key element in using machine learning and bivariate statistical models is the use of input data of the points where the flood phenomena already occurred in the light of the above considerations in this study for detecting the areas prone to floods five models will be tested which are represented by index of entropy ioe stand alone model fuzzy analytical hierarchy process fahp stand alone model support vector machine svm stand alone model fahp ioe and svm ioe the entire training process of the five models will be ensured by using 12 flood predictors 205 flood locations and 205 non flood locations the validation of results was performed using the roc curve and also several statistical indices this study was focused on the buzau river catchment which is one of the most affected regions in romania by flood phenomena 2 study area and data 2 1 the geographical setting of the buzău river catchment buzău river catchment is located in the southeastern part of romania fig 1 overlapping three landforms mountains hills and plains respectively the study area covers a total surface of 5350 km2 with altitudes ranging from 1 m to 1925 m the lithological substrate in the mountainous and hilly area mainly consists of limestones conglomerates marls and sandstones meanwhile the plain area overlaps the quaternary sedimentation zones which include sands gravels loess and clay thus the hard rocks in the mountainous and hilly areas favor the runoff genesis while the presence of clays in the plains and along the main valleys creates the premises of flooding phenomena the low slopes in the plains is another factor which contributes to the increase of the flood potential on average the mean annual precipitation is approximately 750 mm with a maximum of over 1100 mm in the mountainous area and a minimum of less than 500 mm in the lower plains in terms of land use the largest surfaces are covered by forest 40 7 arable land 30 9 pastures 16 3 and built up areas 4 6 the most severe floods within the buzău river catchment occurred in the years 1970 2005 2010 2016 and 2019 and have affected many localities but also essential infrastructure elements such as the national road 2 e85 and the national road 10 2 2 flood inventory in order to run the flood susceptibility models we created a database that includes the locations of floods that occurred between 1990 and 2019 in this regard a correct prediction of surfaces exposed to flood phenomena implies the consideration of the characteristics of the areas affected in the past by flood events the location of the flood events was determined based on data provided by the general inspectorate for emergency situations gies of romania and also on the data collected from the national administration of romanian waters narw it should be mentioned that were taken into account all the flood events that affected at least one element of infrastructure buildings road network etc finally a total of 205 flood events were located within the study area it is worth mentioning that the remote sensing techniques were used to validate the 205 flood locations provided by gies and narw thus in order to verify the correctness of the data provided by the two institutions the normalized difference water index ndwi and the maximum likelihood method was used for supervised classification of satellite imagery were used thus through the classification of satellite imagery and ndwi the location affected by floods in the past were identified and were compared with the data provided by the authorities in order to compute the ndwi for the period before 2014 landsat 5 7 and 8 imagery were used while for the period after 2014 in addition were used the sentinel 1 2 and 3 imagery 2 3 flood conditioning factors the selection of the flood conditioning factors is an essential step in generating an accurate flood susceptibility map after a detailed analysis of the literature choubin et al 2019 costache et al 2020 hong et al 2018 tehrany et al 2014 q wang et al 2015 z wang et al 2015 zaharia et al 2015 the following 12 geographical variables that influence the water accumulation process were initially selected elevation slope slope aspect plan curvature tpi topographic position index twi topographic wetness index convergence index ci hydrologic soil groups land use distance from rivers rainfall and the lithology a digital elevation model dem for the buzău river catchment was obtained from shuttle radar topography mission srtm 30 m database the following flood predictors were derived from the dem at 30 m raster cell size elevation slope convergence index slope aspect plan curvature tpi and twi the hydrological soil groups lithology and land use were extracted from vector databases the distance from rivers was calculated through the euclidean distance method using the river network included in the romanian water cadastre while the rainfall factor was determined based on the data provided by the meteorological national administration of romania below are briefly presented the flood conditioning factors the slope fig 2 a is the geographical factor characterized by the highest influence on both the runoff and the water accumulation process bui et al 2020 costache et al 2014 2015 dou et al 2019 zaharia et al 2017 costache 2014 prăvălie and costache 2013 this factor was classified into five classes the class between 0 and 3 occupies 35 of the surface and includes 65 of the flood pixels fig 4 a approximately 52 of the basin surface is characterized by slopes ranging from 7 to 25 which are mainly present in the middle and upper part of the study area the plan curvature fig 2b is another morphometric factor with a direct influence on flood generation this factor highlights the areas with divergent and convergent runoff in the present case this factor was classified into three classes the class between 0 09 and 0 1 occupies 71 of the study area and concentrates 83 of the flood pixels fig 4b an essential flood conditioning factor that has an impact on the water infiltration process is the hydrological soil group fig 2c the soil texture plays a vital role in the runoff process based on their texture the hydrological soil groups have been classified into four groups a b c and d the soil class b is the most predominant soil group that occupies 54 of the study area and 58 of the total flood pixels fig 4c when saturated the hydrologic group b has a hydraulic conductivity between 10 and 40 μm s which determines a low runoff potential taking into account its characteristics hydrologic soil group a has the lowest runoff potential due to the high rate of infiltration and hydraulic conductivity over 40 μm s group a soils cover 6 of the study area group c soils have a hydraulic conductivity between 1 and 10 μm s and relatively high runoff potential this group of soils covers 18 of the catchment area the hydrologic soil group d covers 22 of the area and has the highest runoff potential and the lowest infiltration rate tpi fig 2d is a factor showing the differences in altitude between the focused and the neighboring cells jenness et al 2004 this morphometric factor was classified into five classes using the natural breaks method as described in costanzo et al 2012 the class between 11 4 10 1 occupies 54 of the area of the buzău river catchment and 37 of flood pixels while the class between 34 1 11 5 has 41 of the total number of flood pixels fig 4d twi fig 2e highlights the tendency of water to accumulate at a certain point in a river catchment this factor was classified into five classes the class between 3 06 and 4 8 is the most widespread occupying 41 of the total area of the catchment while the class 0 37 3 05 occupies 36 fig 4f in the class between 4 81 and 7 02 most flood pixels are located 35 convergence index fig 2f is another conditioning factor used in flood susceptibility analyses in the present case this index was classified into five classes according to the previous studies zaharia et al 2017 over 50 of flood pixels are located in the class 1 0 0 3 the class between 0 1 and 100 accounts 50 of the catchment s surface fig 4f the slope aspect fig 3a was considered as a flood conditioning factor due to its influence on the regime of soil humidity most of the flood pixels 18 are inside the areas with an eastern orientation while on the southern slopes are placed about 45 of the flood pixels overlap fig 5 a the lithology fig 3b was derived from the geological map of romania linzer et al 1998 and was classified into 12 geological categories rock groups approximately 25 of the catchment is covered by flysch while almost 49 of the flood events occurred within the areas with sandstones and clays fig 5b land use fig 3c is another predictor that was derived through remote sensing techniques more specifically in the present study the land use was extracted from the corine land cover 2018 database popovici et al 2013 which was obtained based on supervised classification of satellite imagery in order to obtain the corine land cover dataset sentinel 2 and landsat 8 satellite imagery was used for the study area land use was classified into nine categories the forests land use category covers 44 of the catchment area being followed by the agricultural areas with 31 approximately 31 of the flood pixels overlap the agricultural areas fig 5c distance from rivers fig 3d was classified into eight classes 56 of the flood pixels are located within a distance shorter than 50 m from the rivers and 18 within a distance between 50 and 100 m fig 5d the elevation fig 3e one of the most important factors was classified in 8 elevation classes the most spread elevation class in the study area is characterized by altitudes between 2 and 200 m and accounts for 33 of the total surface about 65 of the flood pixels are located between 2 and 400 m fig 5e rainfall is a flood influencing factor with a direct impact on flood genesis cao et al 2016 costache et al 2020 for this research the rainfall map was constructed using the data provided by the national meteorological administration this factor was classified into eight classes the class ranging from 600 to 700 mm year concentrates 30 of the flood pixels fig 5f 3 materials and methods 3 1 linear support vector machine for feature selection a key step in the given analysis is the assessment of the prediction ability that each flood conditioning factor held in terms of flood susceptibility assessment this step is beneficial in order to reduce the redundant information and the possible uncertainties associated with the analysis and its results linear support vector machine is a potent method used to estimate the prediction capability as through its results the irrelevant and unnecessary input variables can be eliminated lin 2002 this method used for the first time by guyon and elisseeff 2003 is involved in assessing the prediction capability of each flood conditioning factor and will be estimated using the following equation pham et al 2017a 1 f x sign w t a b where f x is the mathematical function on which the linear support vector machine is based wt is the inverse matrix of weight matrix assigned for each flood factor a a1 a2 a12 is the input vector which contains 12 flood conditioning factors and b is the offset of the origin of the hyper plane for the present study the linear support vector machine model was applied through weka 9 3 software unquestionably if a flood conditioning factor holds a weight w close to 0 this factor will have a lower prediction rate than a factor with a higher weight w value chen et al 2017 pham et al 2017b also when the prediction capability of a flood conditioning factor is near to 0 that factor will be considered to remove from further analysis hong et al 2017 mladenić et al 2004 3 2 fuzzy analytical hierarchy process fuzzy analytical hierarchy process fahp represents a combination between the fuzzy set theory and the ahp algorithm and is intended to increase the quality of the analysis by reducing the subjectivity in the criteria of weights estimation feizizadeh et al 2014 therefore we consider that the application of the fahp model will provide more accurate results than those obtained by the application of the ahp stand alone model in the present study the fahp model will be used to determine the weights of each flood conditioning factor within the equation of flood potential the fahp ioe models will be run by integrating the ioe coefficients computed for each factor class category into the final equation together with the weights calculated through fahp in the following section the main aspects of the fuzzy set theory and the ahp algorithm will be presented as well as how these two models are combined 3 2 1 fuzzy set theory the fuzzy set theory introduced by zadeh zadeh 1965 is mainly used in complex systems that allow the use of imprecise vague and ambiguous input information balezentiene et al 2013 in the fuzzy set theory the degree of membership is reflected by a candidate object that takes on membership values between 0 and 1 according to feizizadeh et al 2014 a fuzzy set is described as follows if z denotes a space of objects then the fuzzy set a in z is a set of ordered pairs a x mf x x z where the membership function mf x is the set a s degree of membership to z a triangular fuzzy number tfn m is denoted by the following three parameters m1 m2 and m3 fig 6 b the first parameter m1 highlights the smallest possible value m2 denotes the most promising value while m3 indicates the presence of the largest possible value that describes a fuzzy object kahraman et al 2003 based on the linear representation of tfn on its left and right side its membership function 9 is defined as follows 2 x m 0 x m 1 x m 1 m 2 m 1 m 1 x m 2 m 3 x m 3 m 2 m 2 x m 3 0 x m 3 where x m is the triangular type membership function a specific fuzzy number is given by its corresponding left and right representation of each degree of membership kahraman et al 2003 m m l x m r x m 1 m 2 m 1 x m 3 m 2 m 3 x x ε 0 1 where l x and r x denotes the left side representation and the right side representation of a fuzzy number respectively 3 2 2 combining ahp algorithm with fuzzy set theory the analytical hierarchy process ahp is a semi quantitative algorithm frequently used in the assessment of the potential to natural hazards gigović et al 2017 the main aim of the ahp model is to compute the weights of relevant criterion map layers through a pairwise comparison matrix constructed based on expert knowledge considering that the conventional ahp algorithm cannot reflect the human thinking style the fahp which is a fuzzy extension of ahp was applied in order to solve the hierarchical fuzzy problems kahraman et al 2003 the weights of criteria within the fahp model can be determined through the following two steps all flood conditioning factors were used to construct the pairwise comparison matrices in order to establish which of the two elements criteria is more important linguistic terms were assigned to the pairwise comparison as follows eq 3 sun 2010 3 a 1 a 12 a 1 n a 21 1 a 1 n a n 1 a n 2 1 1 a 12 a 1 n 1 a 12 1 a 2 n 1 a 1 n 1 a 2 n 1 where a ij measure indicates a pair of criteria i and j let 1 be 1 1 1 when i is equal to j i e i j if 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 measure that variable i has a higher relative importance in comparison with the variable j and whereas 1 1 1 2 1 3 1 4 1 5 1 6 1 7 1 8 1 9 measure that variable j is relatively more critical chen et al 2013 the pairwise comparison between the fuzzy parameters was based on the triangular number of linguistic variables that are defined in fig 6b the fuzzy geometric mean and the fuzzy weight of each criterion can be calculated through the buckley method buckley 1985 as follows r i a i 1 a i 2 a in 1 n and then w i r i r 1 r n 1 where a in is the fuzzy comparison value between the pair criterion i and criterion n r 1 is the geometric mean of the fuzzy comparison values for criterion i compared to each of the other criteria and w i is the fuzzy weighting of the i th criterion that can also be represented by a tfn w i lw i mw i uw i where lw i mw i and uw i are the lower middle and upper values respectively of the fuzzy weighting of the ith criterion feizizadeh et al 2014 sun 2010 3 2 3 fahp extent method in order to determine the final values of the corresponding flood predictor weights the extent analysis algorithm was computed the first step of this algorithm is the construction of a fuzzy triangular comparison matrix form 4 wang and chen 2008 4 a a ij nxn 1 1 1 l 12 m 12 u 12 l 1 n m 1 n u 1 n l 21 m 21 u 21 1 1 1 l 2 n m 2 n u 2 n l n 1 m n 1 u n 1 l n 2 m n 2 u n 2 1 1 1 where a ij l ij m ij u ij a n d a ij 1 1 l ij 1 m ij 1 u ij for i j 1 n and i j the extent analysis method and the priority vector of the triangular matrix will be calculated thus in a first stage the fuzzy arithmetic function will be employed to sum up each row of matrix a 5 rs i j 1 n a ij j 1 n l ij j 1 n m ij j 1 n u ij i 1 n fig 6 a the degree of possibility of s i s j b the triangular fuzzy number corresponding to linguistic variables according to the level of preference through the normalization of the above relation the value of the fuzzy synthetic extent in terms of the ith object can be obtained as follows roodposhti et al 2014 6 s i j n a ij k 1 n j 1 n a kj 1 j 1 n l ij k 1 n j 1 n u kj j 1 n m ij k 1 n j 1 n m kj j 1 n u ij k 1 n j 1 n l kj i 1 n the computation of the degree of possibility of s i s j fig 6a represents the third step of the fahp extent method thus by comparing the fuzzy numbers the degree of possibility can be obtained for each pairwise comparison according to the following relation eq 7 ahmed and kilic 2016 7 v s i s j μ s i d 1 i f m i m j u i l j u i m i m j l j l j u i i j 1 n j i 0 o t h e r s where s i l i m i u i s j l j m j u j and d is the crossover point s abscissa of s i a n d s j according to fig 6a considering that 8 w a i min v s i s k k 1 2 n k i then the value of weight vector will be calculated as 9 w a i w a 1 w a 2 w a n t where ai i 1 2 n are n elements after the normalization process the weight vectors can be obtained using the following relation eq 10 10 w a i w a 1 w a 2 w a n t where w is a non fuzzy number 3 3 index of entropy the index of entropy ioe is a bivariate statistical method widely used in studies focusing on the assessment of natural hazards potential khosravi et al 2016 the selection of ioe to model the flood susceptibility within the study area is recommended by the highly accurate results provided by these methods in the previous studies related to the computation of susceptibility to natural hazards siahkamari et al 2018 tien bui et al 2018 costache and tien bui 2020 the entropy measures the disorders instability and uncertainty of a given system by using the index of entropy in the present study we consider that the entropy of a flood event represents the extent to which various factors determine the flood occurrence thus in the index of entropy the weight that each flood conditioning holds in flood potential index computation will be used the final weight for each variable wj can be determined as follows chen et al 2015 11 p ij fr ij i 1 s j fr ij where frij is the frequency ratio coefficient for each class category i of parameter j sj is the number of classes and pij is the probability density thus the probability pij is calculated for each class category of factor as the ratio between the fr value of that class category and the sum of frequency ratio values within a factor wang et al 2015 the frij is calculated as the ratio between the percentage of flood locations located in class category from the total number of flood locations and the percentage of a specific class category within the entire study area 12 h j i 1 s j p ij log 2 p ij j 1 2 n 13 h jmax log 2 s j 14 i j h jmax h j h jmax i 0 1 j 1 n 15 p j 1 s j i 1 s j fr ij 16 w j i j p j where hj and hjmax represent the entropy values ij is the information coefficient pj is the empirical probability and wj is the resultant weight value given to each flood factor the final values of the flood potential index were obtained through the ioe stand alone model by implementing the eq 17 in gis environments devkota et al 2013 17 fsi ioe i 1 n z m i c w j where i is the total number of flood conditioning factors z is the number of classes of the factor that owns the most classes mi is the number of classes of each specific factor c is the value of class after secondary classification and wj is the final weight of each factor 3 4 support vector machine being used in classification and regression problems support vector machine svm represents a machine learning model based on statistical learning theory and the structural risk minimization principle suykens and vandewalle 1999 svm is one of the most powerful machine learning methods whose efficiency in flood susceptibility mapping was demonstrated within the studies carried out during the last years choubin et al 2019 naghibi et al 2017 sachdeva et al 2017 the training data used in the svm model is divided using an optimal hyper plane it is to be noted that in a binary classification the optimal hyper plane is designed to widen the margin between classes pourghasemi et al 2013 the new data will be classified as soon as the hyper plane is obtained in this phase the original input space is being mapped into a high dimensional feature space tien bui et al 2012 in the present study we will take into account the pair xi yi with xi rm yi 1 0 and i 1 m where is a vector of the input space containing the altitude the distance from rivers land use soil classes ndvi slope angle sti lithology twi rainfall plan curvature and the slope aspect whilst y 1 represent the flood pixels presence and non flood pixels presence when y 0 the svm algorithm will be used to highlight the line which divides the most precise way that the flood and non flood pixels are located in a 2 d space if the training of the training data can be linearly separated the hyper plane could be defined as follows tien bui et al 2012 18 y i w x i b 1 ξ i where w is a coefficient vector that determines the orientation of the hyper plane in the feature space b represents the offset of the hyper plane from the origin and ξi is the positive slack variable tien bui et al 2012 the optimal hyperplane can be obtained by using the lagrange multipliers as follows tien bui et al 2012 19 minimize i 1 n α i 1 2 i j 1 n α i α j y i y j x i x j 20 s u b j e c t t o i 1 n α i y i 00 α i c where αi represents the lagrange multipliers and c is the penalty parameter that controls the trade off between the complexity of the decision function and the number of misclassified training examples costache 2019a the new data can be classified when the linear hyper plane is being used the classification can be obtained through the following relation 21 f x s i g n i 1 n y i α i x i b in the case when a non linear separable hyper plane is being required the original input will move into a high dimensional feature space therefore a non linear kernel function will be used the following relation will be used in order to classify the new data osuna and girosi 1998 22 f x i 1 n α i α i k x i x b therefore the αi and αi represent the lagrange multipliers αi 0 αi c and k xi xj represents the kernel function the open source machine learning weka software will be used for the training process of the svm fr and svm woe hybrid models for the calculation of the svm based hybrid models we will use the radial basis function one of the most efficient functions kavzoglu et al 2014 wechsler 2000 the following formulae represent the mathematical expression of the radial basis function tehrany et al 2015 23 k x i x j e x p γ x i x j γ 0 in which γ is the gamma term in the kernel function for all kernel types except the linear ones 4 the proposed methodology for predicting potential flood areas a sophisticated workflow including the use of 3 stand alone and 2 hybrid models was developed in order to estimate the flood potential across the study area the workflow is graphically described in fig 7 4 1 establishment of the flood database for the buzău river catchment it can be noted that the database required for the present research was constructed with the help of the arccatalog application thus along with the 12 flood conditioning factors the database comprises 205 flood locations in order to be more easily processed the data regarding the flood influencing factors were converted in raster format with a cell size of 30 30 m according to other studies tehrany et al 2014 a new sample with the absence of flood phenomena non flood locations has been generated this sample also contains 205 points which are placed in areas with high slopes or at high distances from the rivers where floods are less likely to occur 4 2 training data validation data and feature selection another essential step of the present analysis is the establishment of training and validating data thus the data used to train the flood potential models consists of the 12 flood influencing factors in raster format along with a specific percentage of the flood and non flood locations thus according to tehrany et al 2015 a percentage equal to 70 of the flood and non flood locations were used as the training sample while the other 30 of flood and non flood locations were used for results validation the training and validating samples were divided through the subset features tool implemented in gis software therefore a total number of 288 locations 144 floods and 144 non floods were included in the training sample while the other 122 locations 61 floods and 61 non floods was involved in the validation process it should be mentioned also that the flood locations were encoded with 1 and non flood locations were encoded with 0 in addition for a number of 8 flood predictors that are characterized by numerical values several descriptive statistics were computed table 1 it should be mentioned that the descriptive statistics were computed by using the flood and non flood points within the training and validating samples further as was stated at 3 1 the linear support vector machine algorithm was employed for feature selection thus in this step the entire flood and non flood sample together with the flood conditioning factors were used in weka software in order to determine the predictive ability for each geographical variable 4 3 configuration and training of flood models in terms of the ioe stand alone model the assessment of flood potential requires the calculation of the probability density pij for each factor class categories and the weights of flood conditioning factors in this regard the flood locations from the training sample were used in the first stage the pij and weights of flood conditioning factors were calculated using the eq 11 and 16 further the flood potential index was calculated by using the eq 17 in order to derive the flood potential index through the fahp stand alone model the analytical hierarchy process was used in the first step in order to calculate the weights of each factor class category thus the ahp weights were computed with the help of 12 comparison matrices that were generated in microsoft excel 2013 software the comparison matrix were constructed based on the human expert opinions it should be mentioned that a survey was sent by email to a number of 23 experts from the romanian waters national administration the experts provided their opinion regarding the hierarchy of the importance of the factor classes categories in terms of flood potential the entire procedure of ahp algorithm is presented in many scientific works pourghasemi et al 2013 yalcin 2008 yoshimatsu and abe 2006 all the ahp weights were assigned to each factor class category in gis environment the second step consisted in the construction of the fuzzy analytical hierarchy process evaluation matrix which was used in order to calculate the weights of each flood conditioning factor the final step in the computation of flood potential index through the fahp model was the multiplication of the flood conditioning factors raster having the ahp weights assigned with the weights derived from fahp model in terms of fahp ioe the flood potential was derived by the multiplication of ioe coefficients with the fahp weights the configuration of svm stand alone and svm ioe models was ensured through arcgis 10 5 and weka 9 3 software thus in the first step the information regarding the normalized values of flood conditioning factors and the ioe coefficients was extracted in gis environment for each flood and non flood location from the training sample further these data in csv tabular format were imported in weka software where the weights of each flood predictor were calculated by support vector machine algorithm it should be remarked that for both svm stand alone and svm ioe models the radial basis function was used it is very important to mention that the performance of the svm model will heavily depends on the correctness of estimation of the c and γ parameters cross validation was implied to establish the best values of these parameters c and γ for each of the two models therefore in terms of svm stand alone the c parameter obtained a value of 1 5 and the γ was equal to 0 16 while in terms of svm ioe the c parameter achieved a value of 1 8 whereas the γ parameter received a value of 0 13 4 4 performance evaluation of the flood models the roc curve model was involved in the results validation procedure within the majority of studies related to the assessment of potential to a natural hazard for a specific area khosravi et al 2018 razavi termeh et al 2018 siahkamari et al 2018 the roc curve graph is a technique for visualizing organizing and selecting classifiers based on their performance fawcett 2006 the roc curve is mainly used to judge the discrimination ability of the statistical models that combine different test results for predictive purposes hanley and mcneil 1982 the area under curve auc represent the main statistical indicator of roc curve the auc is used to measure the accuracy and the performance of the applied models bradley 1997 in the present research the roc curve will describe the capacity of the models to correctly predict the occurrence of the flood phenomena the graphical representation will be possible by plotting the sensitivity on y axis against the specificity on x axis the closer the value of auc gets to 1 the better the model is pallant 2016 the following equation can be used to calculate the auc values chen et al 2018 23 a u c t p t n p n where tp true positive represent the correctly classified flood pixels tn true negative represent the correctly classified non flood pixels p is the total number of flood pixels and n is the total number of non flood pixels in the present study both the succes rate and the prediction rate were constructed the success rate is a type of roc curve plot which highlights the model fitting rate and indicates how the flood potential index separates the flood locations within the susceptibility zones the prediction rate is also a type of roc curve plot which reveal the model performance in terms of the prediction of the future flood events vakhshoori and zare 2018 for the success rate the flood and non flood points from the training dataset were used while for the prediction rate the flood and non flood points from validating dataset along were involved in addition to the roc curve and auc the next statistical metrics were computed specificity sensitivity accuracy kappa index the specificity represents a statistical indicator which measures the proportion of non flood pixels that are correctly classified as non flood pixles baratloo et al 2015 the sensitivity represents a statistical index which measures the proportion of flood pixels that are classified as flood pixels baratloo et al 2015 the accuracy represents the ability of test to differentiate the flood and non flood pixels baratloo et al 2015 kappa index k is a statistical indicator that measures the agreement between two raters who each classify the total number of flood and non flood pixels into two exclusive categories flood and non flood respectively through the below written equation the aforementioned statistical measures could be determined 24 k p o p e 1 p e s e n s i t i v i t y t p t p f n s p e c i f i c i t y t n f p t n a c c u r a c y t p t n t p f p t n f n where fp false positive are the number of flood pixels erroneously classified and fn false negative are the number of non flood pixels erroneously classified k is kappa coefficient po is the observed flood pixels and pe is the estimated flood pixels according to queiroz et al 2016 if the values of the above indices exceed the threshold of 0 81 it is considered that there is almost a perfect agreement between the observed and the predicted values 5 results 5 1 predictiveness of the flood conditioning factors by using the linear support vector machine model the hierarchy of flood predictors in terms of the average merit am values were established in the present case the am is used as a conventional term in order to express the weights of factors calculated by linear support vector machine lsvm using weka software 9 3 thus the am values are equal to the weights calculated through lsvm this measure am highlights the level of the predictive ability of each flash flood predictor in terms of flood susceptibility the slope angle obtained the highest am 0 766 being followed by distance from rivers 0 668 land use 0 497 tpi 0 495 lithology 0 473 twi 0 41 convergence index 0 393 plan curvature 0 377 altitudes 0 356 rainfall 0 266 hydrological soil group 0 138 and aspect 0 089 fig 8 according to the results presented above all the flood conditioning factors have am values higher than 0 it should be noted that within the literature there is no general consensus regarding a specific threshold below which the variables should be removed from the analysis therefore since all the variables have a certain influence on flood genesis all the flood conditioning factors will be used in the analysis in order to determine the flood potential moreover we consider that in order to have a complete overview on the flood susceptibility across a specific region it is very important to take into consideration all the variables that has an influence on flood genesis however small that influence is 5 2 performance of the flood models the success rate and the prediction rate fig 9 a and b were employed to test the reliability and the accuracy of the proposed models 70 of the flood location training data was used to prepare the success rate while the other 30 validating data was involved in the construction of the prediction rate it can be noted that larger values of auc indicate a higher performance of the algorithms in terms of the success rate the results highlight that svm ioe with an auc 0 979 was the best model while fahp stand alone methods achieved the lowest performance auc 0 947 fig 9a further the results of prediction rate indicate that fahp ioe has the highest predictive ability auc 0 93 while the fahp method was again the weakest algorithm auc 0 909 fig 9b in the second stage the reliability of the results was verified by several statistical measures the use of the training data to calculate the indices mentioned above highlights the fact that the svm ioe model is the most performant of all this model achieved a value of 94 5 in the case of sensitivity which is higher than 93 8 obtained by fahp ioe also higher than 92 5 in the case of ioe stand alone the same situation can be observed in the case of specificity where the value of 95 8 achieved by svm ioe is higher than 94 4 fahp ioe and also higher than 93 7 ioe it can be noted that svm ioe achieved very good performances also in terms of accuracy 95 1 and kappa index 0 903 table 2 the use of the validating data revealed that svm ioe was the most performant model in the case of all statistical measures the svm ioe obtained the following results sensitivity 91 9 specificity 93 3 accuracy 92 6 and kappa index 0 852 5 3 flood modeling with index of entropy the first step of the application of ioe model consisted into calculating the frequency ratio fr values for each class category of factors the highest value of 10 7 fr coefficients was attributed to the twi class between 10 68 and 19 89 followed by the water bodies land use category fr 8 89 the distance from rivers between 0 and 50 m fr 6 35 and the built up areas land use category fr 4 52 it can be noted that 10 classes categories achieved fr value equal to 0 table 3 the fr values were employed to obtain the probability density pij the highest value of 0 7 was achieved by the twi class between 10 68 and 19 89 followed by the slope class between 3 1 and 7 pij 0 57 table 3 and the distance from rivers between 0 and 50 m pij 0 53 as in the case of the fr coefficients the same classes categories obtained a probability density equal to 0 after 5 following successive steps which implied the use of the probability density the weights of each flood conditioning factor were obtained the highest weight was held by the twi 2 51 followed by the land use 1 69 distance from rivers 1 22 tpi 1 06 slope 0 82 rainfall 0 67 hydrological soil groups 0 66 aspect 0 64 plan curvature 0 61 convergence index 0 6 elevation 0 6 and lithology 0 55 finally the fpiioe was obtained by multiplying the weights of the flood predictors with the ioe coefficients assigned to each class category the fpiioe fig 10 values ranging from 0 38 to 5 65 have been grouped into 5 classes defined by the natural breaks method the first class between 0 38 and 1 17 occupies 25 43 of the total study area and indicates the surfaces with very low flood potential the class between 1 17 and 1 68 covers about 32 13 of the total surface of the buzău river basin and emphasizes surfaces with low flood potential the medium values of fpiioe are distributed especially in the plainregion and represent about 30 the high and very high values of the fpiioe occupy about 12 5 of the buzău river basin and occur mainly along the main rivers of the study area 5 4 flood modeling with the fahp stand alone and fahp ioe the estimation of ahp weights for each class category of flood conditioning was the first step in the application of fahp stand alone model the ahp weights included in table 4 were obtained by constructing 12 pair wise comparison matrices for each flood conditioning factors the highest values of ahp weights 0 587 were assigned to plan curvature class between 0 11 and 0 48 table 4 followed by hydrological soil group d 0 582 convergence index class between 1 0 0 and 3 etc the construction of the fuzzy pairwise comparison matrix table 5 was the second step of the workflow developed through the fahp model thus the 12 criteria flood conditioning factors were compared within the matrix further the synthetic fuzzy values derived according to the methodology described at 4 3 3 were computed in order to be included in the calculation process of the final weights of flood predictors in this regard the analysis was performed according to the following steps 25 k 1 n j 1 n a kj 1 194 17254 58323 77 1 0 0030 0040 005 further the fuzzy number were compared by mean of the degree of possibility procedure the results of these comparisons are inserted in table 6 and were further used to determine the weight vector according to eq 26 and 27 26 w a i 0 53 0 43 0 49 0 09 0 05 1 0 03 0 16 0 07 0 04 0 03 0 02 t 27 w a i 0 196 0 157 0 179 0 033 0 018 0 367 0 011 0 058 0 025 0 146 0 011 0 007 t thus through the defuzzification process the tfns were converted into the values of the crisp weights which will later be assigned for each flood conditioning factor in order to estimate the flood potential as mentioned before within the methodology the fpifahp and fpifahp ioe values will be obtained by the multiplication of the crisp weight s values with the ahp and ioe coefficients fpifahp fig 11 a values ranging from 0 07 and 0 37 were split into 5 classes through natural breaks method the first class between 0 07 and 0 13 covers approximately 19 35 of the buzău river basin while the low values included in the second class are distributed on around 37 9 of the study area medium flood potential is encountered on 21 2 while the high and very high fpifahp values are spread over 21 5 of the entire study area the fpifahp ioe model fig 11 b with the values between 0 04 and 0 8 was classified into 5 classes using natural breaks method the first class ranging between 0 04 and 0 19 covers almost 27 of the study area especially in the mountainous areas whereas the small values of the fpifahp ioe ranging between 0 19 and 0 35 cover 31 55 of the research area fig 12 the average values of the fpifahp ioe occupy about 25 of the study area while the ivth and vth classes of fpi cover a total surface of 17 unlike in the fpiioe the high and very high values of fpifahp ioe occur in the transitioning areas from hilly region to the plain region 5 5 flood modeling with the svm stand alone and svm ioe in the first stage the svm stand alone model was used to determine the flood potential across the study area in this regard the values of flood conditioning factors and the flood and non flood points from the training samples were used as input data the determination of the weights for each flood predictor was optimized by the use of the two parameters represented by c 1 5 and γ 0 16 the slope angle was the most important factor 15 93 followed by distance from river 14 84 land use 11 68 tpi 11 35 lithology 8 47 rainfall 7 72 convergence index 6 04 elevation 5 71 hydrological soil group 4 52 twi 4 37 plan curvature 4 26 and aspect 3 69 fig 13 the application of svm ioe assumed the use of ioe coefficients as input data and a new estimation of the two parameters c 1 8 and γ 0 13 in this case the distance from rivers achieved the highest relative importance 17 63 followed by the slope angle 17 35 land use 13 06 lithology 10 26 tpi 9 24 rainfall 6 53 plan curvature 6 34 aspect 5 32 convergence index 5 32 elevation 4 66 hydrological soil groups 2 33 and the twi 1 96 fig 14 fpisvm values ranging from 0 06 to 0 33 were divided into five classes using the natural breaks method the very low flood potential is encountered on 16 13 of the study area while the low value of fpisvm can be found on 22 6 a percentage of 43 28 of the study area is covered by medium values of fpisvm while the high and very high flood potential appears on approximately 18 of buzău river basin further the fpisvm ioe values between 0 28 and 5 31 were divided into five classes using the same method like in the case of the previous four flood potential indices it is noted that from the total surface of the basin around 28 62 of the area is represented by the very low flood potential class and 31 23 of those with low potential the average values of the fpifahp ioe are present around 20 of the buzau river basin 6 discussion and conclusions the flood potential index for the buzău river catchment has been computed in past researches and has been done through various techniques that have shown different results the past researches have been based on a simpler analysis which involved the overlay of the conditioning factors without taking into account the locations of the historical floods it should be noted that the historical floods provide essential data in the detection of the areas prone to floods and their spread previous researches conducted by costache et al 2015 and zaharia et al 2017 have not attempted to validate the results through various validation methods as was made in the present study the results validation methods confirmed the high performance of the models which were employed to compute the flood potential index in the present research therefore we consider that the models could be used at a national scale for flood hazard mapping the idea that global climate change causes an increase in flood frequency is unanimously accepted by the international scientific world taking into account this consideration the assessment of certain territories from the flood susceptibility point of view represent a mandatory activity that should be included in the flood risk management the main result of the present study is represented by the values of flood potential index which were spatially modeled across the buzău river basin in order to derive the fpi values a number of three stand alone models index of entropy fuzzy analytical hierarchy process support vector machine and two hybrids fahp ioe and svm ioe were used the models were trained by using 144 flood and 144 non flood points which represent the dependent variables and 12 flood predictors representing the independent variables during the application of the methodological workflow there were achieved some auxiliary results represented by the ahp and ioe coefficients assigned to each factor class category or by the weight values of the flood predictors calculated through fahp and svm models these auxiliary results contributed to the achievement of the main result of the analysis it should be noted that seven flood conditioning factors were derived from databases that were obtained by applying remote sensing techniques so it should be noted the essential role which remote sensing holds in assessment of potential to different natural hazards it should be mentioned that after an initial evaluation of the predictive ability of the conditioning factors through the linear support vector machine method all 12 factors were further considered into the analysis the results of the analysis highlighted that the areas with a high and very high flood potential occupy between 13 fpiioe and 21 5 fpifahp of the study area the most prone areas are located near watercourses and also in the plain region where the slope is low the validation process shows that in terms of the success rate the hybrid svm ioe was the most performant model auc 0979 while in terms of prediction rate fahp ioe obtained the highest performance auc 0 93 given the fact that the buzau river basin is one of the most affected regions by floods in romania the results can be useful to the local authorities responsible for the management of emergency situations also since the methods used in this study have had a high performance rate they can represent a strong benchmark for future studies credit authorship contribution statement romulus costache conceptualization investigation data curation visualization

5564,the global warming and climate changes determined a considerable increase in the frequency of floods and their related damages therefore the high accuracy prediction of flood susceptible areas plays a key role in flood warnings and risk reduction the main objective of this study is to propose novel hybridizations of fuzzy analytical hierarchy process fahp index of entropy ioe and support vector machine svm for predicting the areas susceptible to floods buzău river catchment romania was the area on which the present study was focused in this regard a database with 205 flooded locations 205 non flood locations and 12 flood predictors was established and used to train and validate the flood susceptibility models the performance of the proposed models was evaluated using the receiver operating characteristic roc curve and statistical metrics the results show that all the hybrid models have a high prediction performance and outperform the stand alone models among them the svm ioe model auc 0 979 has the highest performance followed by the fahp ioe auc 0 97 ioe auc 0 969 svm auc 0 966 and fahp auc 0 947 these results highlight a very high efficiency of all the applied models the application of the models mentioned above revealed that a percentage between 12 5 fpiioe and 21 2 fpifahp of the study area is characterized by high and very high exposure to these hydrological hazards keywords environmental modeling flood hybridization fuzzy analytical hierarchy process index of entropy support vector machine 1 introduction floods are natural risk phenomena causing severe damages to the environment loss of human life determining a slowdown of the economic development of many areas across the world it is increasingly evident that the overall frequency of major flood events will increase over the next few years this fact being directly connected with the global climate changes spence et al 2011 this higher frequency and severity of the flood phenomena will inevitably cause exponential growth in terms of economic damage and loss of human life jongman 2018 globally each year the floods are responsible for economic losses totaling over 20 billion and more for than 3000 casualties nicklin et al 2019 in europe the damages caused by floods are expected to increase five times until the year 2050 and 17 times until the year 2080 european environment agency 2017 romania is one of the most flood affected european countries costache 2019a throughout the 20th and early 21st century numerous areas across romania were affected by historical floods such as those occurring in the years 1912 1932 1969 1970 2005 2006 and 2010 grecu et al 2017 annually in romania floods cause material losses of over 100 million euros with the accession to the european union in 2007 romania was forced to align the directives of the european parliament such as the directive 2007 60 ec the activities related to flood risk management are included in this directive floods occurrence is difficult to prevent and their devastating effects are often amplified by certain human activities minea et al 2019 and also by climate changes however certain measures undertaken by the responsible authorities can significantly decrease the amount of damage produced by the floods and also can reduce the loss of human life at the base of all measures intended to reduce the flood vulnerability is the identification of the areas with a high risk to these types of natural hazards one of the methods used to quantify the areas susceptible to severe flooding is the hydraulic modeling through which the floodplain extent is directly related to certain discharge values with different probabilities of exceedance nevertheless the hydraulic modeling is time consuming and also the necessary data like a digital elevation model at a high resolution are expensive during the last years many state of the art methods with the ability to integrate the flood predictors into a gis environment were frequently used in the studies related to the flood susceptibility assessment ahmadlou et al 2018 costache et al 2019b costache and bui 2019 mahmoud and gan 2018 tien bui et al 2019 costache and prăvălie 2012 also the role of certain flood predictors on the accumulation of water at the soil surface can be quantified thus the most widely used models in the category of bivariate statistics are statistical index certainty factor frequency ratio index of entropy and weights of evidence costache and zaharia 2017 khosravi et al 2016 kumar samanta et al 2018 tehrany et al 2013 machine learning algorithms are represented by the models like artificial neural networks support vector machine logistic regression adaptive neuro fuzzy inference system and decision trees arabameri et al 2019 choubin et al 2019 costache 2019b 2019c dou et al 2019 hong et al 2018 mojaddadi et al 2017 tehrany et al 2014 tien bui et al 2016 wang et al 2019 wang et al 2015 the hybrid methods formed by combining two or more stand alone models are considered more advanced providing much more accurate results a key element in using machine learning and bivariate statistical models is the use of input data of the points where the flood phenomena already occurred in the light of the above considerations in this study for detecting the areas prone to floods five models will be tested which are represented by index of entropy ioe stand alone model fuzzy analytical hierarchy process fahp stand alone model support vector machine svm stand alone model fahp ioe and svm ioe the entire training process of the five models will be ensured by using 12 flood predictors 205 flood locations and 205 non flood locations the validation of results was performed using the roc curve and also several statistical indices this study was focused on the buzau river catchment which is one of the most affected regions in romania by flood phenomena 2 study area and data 2 1 the geographical setting of the buzău river catchment buzău river catchment is located in the southeastern part of romania fig 1 overlapping three landforms mountains hills and plains respectively the study area covers a total surface of 5350 km2 with altitudes ranging from 1 m to 1925 m the lithological substrate in the mountainous and hilly area mainly consists of limestones conglomerates marls and sandstones meanwhile the plain area overlaps the quaternary sedimentation zones which include sands gravels loess and clay thus the hard rocks in the mountainous and hilly areas favor the runoff genesis while the presence of clays in the plains and along the main valleys creates the premises of flooding phenomena the low slopes in the plains is another factor which contributes to the increase of the flood potential on average the mean annual precipitation is approximately 750 mm with a maximum of over 1100 mm in the mountainous area and a minimum of less than 500 mm in the lower plains in terms of land use the largest surfaces are covered by forest 40 7 arable land 30 9 pastures 16 3 and built up areas 4 6 the most severe floods within the buzău river catchment occurred in the years 1970 2005 2010 2016 and 2019 and have affected many localities but also essential infrastructure elements such as the national road 2 e85 and the national road 10 2 2 flood inventory in order to run the flood susceptibility models we created a database that includes the locations of floods that occurred between 1990 and 2019 in this regard a correct prediction of surfaces exposed to flood phenomena implies the consideration of the characteristics of the areas affected in the past by flood events the location of the flood events was determined based on data provided by the general inspectorate for emergency situations gies of romania and also on the data collected from the national administration of romanian waters narw it should be mentioned that were taken into account all the flood events that affected at least one element of infrastructure buildings road network etc finally a total of 205 flood events were located within the study area it is worth mentioning that the remote sensing techniques were used to validate the 205 flood locations provided by gies and narw thus in order to verify the correctness of the data provided by the two institutions the normalized difference water index ndwi and the maximum likelihood method was used for supervised classification of satellite imagery were used thus through the classification of satellite imagery and ndwi the location affected by floods in the past were identified and were compared with the data provided by the authorities in order to compute the ndwi for the period before 2014 landsat 5 7 and 8 imagery were used while for the period after 2014 in addition were used the sentinel 1 2 and 3 imagery 2 3 flood conditioning factors the selection of the flood conditioning factors is an essential step in generating an accurate flood susceptibility map after a detailed analysis of the literature choubin et al 2019 costache et al 2020 hong et al 2018 tehrany et al 2014 q wang et al 2015 z wang et al 2015 zaharia et al 2015 the following 12 geographical variables that influence the water accumulation process were initially selected elevation slope slope aspect plan curvature tpi topographic position index twi topographic wetness index convergence index ci hydrologic soil groups land use distance from rivers rainfall and the lithology a digital elevation model dem for the buzău river catchment was obtained from shuttle radar topography mission srtm 30 m database the following flood predictors were derived from the dem at 30 m raster cell size elevation slope convergence index slope aspect plan curvature tpi and twi the hydrological soil groups lithology and land use were extracted from vector databases the distance from rivers was calculated through the euclidean distance method using the river network included in the romanian water cadastre while the rainfall factor was determined based on the data provided by the meteorological national administration of romania below are briefly presented the flood conditioning factors the slope fig 2 a is the geographical factor characterized by the highest influence on both the runoff and the water accumulation process bui et al 2020 costache et al 2014 2015 dou et al 2019 zaharia et al 2017 costache 2014 prăvălie and costache 2013 this factor was classified into five classes the class between 0 and 3 occupies 35 of the surface and includes 65 of the flood pixels fig 4 a approximately 52 of the basin surface is characterized by slopes ranging from 7 to 25 which are mainly present in the middle and upper part of the study area the plan curvature fig 2b is another morphometric factor with a direct influence on flood generation this factor highlights the areas with divergent and convergent runoff in the present case this factor was classified into three classes the class between 0 09 and 0 1 occupies 71 of the study area and concentrates 83 of the flood pixels fig 4b an essential flood conditioning factor that has an impact on the water infiltration process is the hydrological soil group fig 2c the soil texture plays a vital role in the runoff process based on their texture the hydrological soil groups have been classified into four groups a b c and d the soil class b is the most predominant soil group that occupies 54 of the study area and 58 of the total flood pixels fig 4c when saturated the hydrologic group b has a hydraulic conductivity between 10 and 40 μm s which determines a low runoff potential taking into account its characteristics hydrologic soil group a has the lowest runoff potential due to the high rate of infiltration and hydraulic conductivity over 40 μm s group a soils cover 6 of the study area group c soils have a hydraulic conductivity between 1 and 10 μm s and relatively high runoff potential this group of soils covers 18 of the catchment area the hydrologic soil group d covers 22 of the area and has the highest runoff potential and the lowest infiltration rate tpi fig 2d is a factor showing the differences in altitude between the focused and the neighboring cells jenness et al 2004 this morphometric factor was classified into five classes using the natural breaks method as described in costanzo et al 2012 the class between 11 4 10 1 occupies 54 of the area of the buzău river catchment and 37 of flood pixels while the class between 34 1 11 5 has 41 of the total number of flood pixels fig 4d twi fig 2e highlights the tendency of water to accumulate at a certain point in a river catchment this factor was classified into five classes the class between 3 06 and 4 8 is the most widespread occupying 41 of the total area of the catchment while the class 0 37 3 05 occupies 36 fig 4f in the class between 4 81 and 7 02 most flood pixels are located 35 convergence index fig 2f is another conditioning factor used in flood susceptibility analyses in the present case this index was classified into five classes according to the previous studies zaharia et al 2017 over 50 of flood pixels are located in the class 1 0 0 3 the class between 0 1 and 100 accounts 50 of the catchment s surface fig 4f the slope aspect fig 3a was considered as a flood conditioning factor due to its influence on the regime of soil humidity most of the flood pixels 18 are inside the areas with an eastern orientation while on the southern slopes are placed about 45 of the flood pixels overlap fig 5 a the lithology fig 3b was derived from the geological map of romania linzer et al 1998 and was classified into 12 geological categories rock groups approximately 25 of the catchment is covered by flysch while almost 49 of the flood events occurred within the areas with sandstones and clays fig 5b land use fig 3c is another predictor that was derived through remote sensing techniques more specifically in the present study the land use was extracted from the corine land cover 2018 database popovici et al 2013 which was obtained based on supervised classification of satellite imagery in order to obtain the corine land cover dataset sentinel 2 and landsat 8 satellite imagery was used for the study area land use was classified into nine categories the forests land use category covers 44 of the catchment area being followed by the agricultural areas with 31 approximately 31 of the flood pixels overlap the agricultural areas fig 5c distance from rivers fig 3d was classified into eight classes 56 of the flood pixels are located within a distance shorter than 50 m from the rivers and 18 within a distance between 50 and 100 m fig 5d the elevation fig 3e one of the most important factors was classified in 8 elevation classes the most spread elevation class in the study area is characterized by altitudes between 2 and 200 m and accounts for 33 of the total surface about 65 of the flood pixels are located between 2 and 400 m fig 5e rainfall is a flood influencing factor with a direct impact on flood genesis cao et al 2016 costache et al 2020 for this research the rainfall map was constructed using the data provided by the national meteorological administration this factor was classified into eight classes the class ranging from 600 to 700 mm year concentrates 30 of the flood pixels fig 5f 3 materials and methods 3 1 linear support vector machine for feature selection a key step in the given analysis is the assessment of the prediction ability that each flood conditioning factor held in terms of flood susceptibility assessment this step is beneficial in order to reduce the redundant information and the possible uncertainties associated with the analysis and its results linear support vector machine is a potent method used to estimate the prediction capability as through its results the irrelevant and unnecessary input variables can be eliminated lin 2002 this method used for the first time by guyon and elisseeff 2003 is involved in assessing the prediction capability of each flood conditioning factor and will be estimated using the following equation pham et al 2017a 1 f x sign w t a b where f x is the mathematical function on which the linear support vector machine is based wt is the inverse matrix of weight matrix assigned for each flood factor a a1 a2 a12 is the input vector which contains 12 flood conditioning factors and b is the offset of the origin of the hyper plane for the present study the linear support vector machine model was applied through weka 9 3 software unquestionably if a flood conditioning factor holds a weight w close to 0 this factor will have a lower prediction rate than a factor with a higher weight w value chen et al 2017 pham et al 2017b also when the prediction capability of a flood conditioning factor is near to 0 that factor will be considered to remove from further analysis hong et al 2017 mladenić et al 2004 3 2 fuzzy analytical hierarchy process fuzzy analytical hierarchy process fahp represents a combination between the fuzzy set theory and the ahp algorithm and is intended to increase the quality of the analysis by reducing the subjectivity in the criteria of weights estimation feizizadeh et al 2014 therefore we consider that the application of the fahp model will provide more accurate results than those obtained by the application of the ahp stand alone model in the present study the fahp model will be used to determine the weights of each flood conditioning factor within the equation of flood potential the fahp ioe models will be run by integrating the ioe coefficients computed for each factor class category into the final equation together with the weights calculated through fahp in the following section the main aspects of the fuzzy set theory and the ahp algorithm will be presented as well as how these two models are combined 3 2 1 fuzzy set theory the fuzzy set theory introduced by zadeh zadeh 1965 is mainly used in complex systems that allow the use of imprecise vague and ambiguous input information balezentiene et al 2013 in the fuzzy set theory the degree of membership is reflected by a candidate object that takes on membership values between 0 and 1 according to feizizadeh et al 2014 a fuzzy set is described as follows if z denotes a space of objects then the fuzzy set a in z is a set of ordered pairs a x mf x x z where the membership function mf x is the set a s degree of membership to z a triangular fuzzy number tfn m is denoted by the following three parameters m1 m2 and m3 fig 6 b the first parameter m1 highlights the smallest possible value m2 denotes the most promising value while m3 indicates the presence of the largest possible value that describes a fuzzy object kahraman et al 2003 based on the linear representation of tfn on its left and right side its membership function 9 is defined as follows 2 x m 0 x m 1 x m 1 m 2 m 1 m 1 x m 2 m 3 x m 3 m 2 m 2 x m 3 0 x m 3 where x m is the triangular type membership function a specific fuzzy number is given by its corresponding left and right representation of each degree of membership kahraman et al 2003 m m l x m r x m 1 m 2 m 1 x m 3 m 2 m 3 x x ε 0 1 where l x and r x denotes the left side representation and the right side representation of a fuzzy number respectively 3 2 2 combining ahp algorithm with fuzzy set theory the analytical hierarchy process ahp is a semi quantitative algorithm frequently used in the assessment of the potential to natural hazards gigović et al 2017 the main aim of the ahp model is to compute the weights of relevant criterion map layers through a pairwise comparison matrix constructed based on expert knowledge considering that the conventional ahp algorithm cannot reflect the human thinking style the fahp which is a fuzzy extension of ahp was applied in order to solve the hierarchical fuzzy problems kahraman et al 2003 the weights of criteria within the fahp model can be determined through the following two steps all flood conditioning factors were used to construct the pairwise comparison matrices in order to establish which of the two elements criteria is more important linguistic terms were assigned to the pairwise comparison as follows eq 3 sun 2010 3 a 1 a 12 a 1 n a 21 1 a 1 n a n 1 a n 2 1 1 a 12 a 1 n 1 a 12 1 a 2 n 1 a 1 n 1 a 2 n 1 where a ij measure indicates a pair of criteria i and j let 1 be 1 1 1 when i is equal to j i e i j if 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 measure that variable i has a higher relative importance in comparison with the variable j and whereas 1 1 1 2 1 3 1 4 1 5 1 6 1 7 1 8 1 9 measure that variable j is relatively more critical chen et al 2013 the pairwise comparison between the fuzzy parameters was based on the triangular number of linguistic variables that are defined in fig 6b the fuzzy geometric mean and the fuzzy weight of each criterion can be calculated through the buckley method buckley 1985 as follows r i a i 1 a i 2 a in 1 n and then w i r i r 1 r n 1 where a in is the fuzzy comparison value between the pair criterion i and criterion n r 1 is the geometric mean of the fuzzy comparison values for criterion i compared to each of the other criteria and w i is the fuzzy weighting of the i th criterion that can also be represented by a tfn w i lw i mw i uw i where lw i mw i and uw i are the lower middle and upper values respectively of the fuzzy weighting of the ith criterion feizizadeh et al 2014 sun 2010 3 2 3 fahp extent method in order to determine the final values of the corresponding flood predictor weights the extent analysis algorithm was computed the first step of this algorithm is the construction of a fuzzy triangular comparison matrix form 4 wang and chen 2008 4 a a ij nxn 1 1 1 l 12 m 12 u 12 l 1 n m 1 n u 1 n l 21 m 21 u 21 1 1 1 l 2 n m 2 n u 2 n l n 1 m n 1 u n 1 l n 2 m n 2 u n 2 1 1 1 where a ij l ij m ij u ij a n d a ij 1 1 l ij 1 m ij 1 u ij for i j 1 n and i j the extent analysis method and the priority vector of the triangular matrix will be calculated thus in a first stage the fuzzy

corresponding to linguistic variables according to the level of preference through the normalization of the above relation the value of the fuzzy synthetic extent in terms of the ith object can be obtained as follows roodposhti et al 2014 6 s i j n a ij k 1 n j 1 n a kj 1 j 1 n l ij k 1 n j 1 n u kj j 1 n m ij k 1 n j 1 n m kj j 1 n u ij k 1 n j 1 n l kj i 1 n the computation of the degree of possibility of s i s j fig 6a represents the third step of the fahp extent method thus by comparing the fuzzy numbers the degree of possibility can be obtained for each pairwise comparison according to the following relation eq 7 ahmed and kilic 2016 7 v s i s j μ s i d 1 i f m i m j u i l j u i m i m j l j l j u i i j 1 n j i 0 o t h e r s where s i l i m i u i s j l j m j u j and d is the crossover point s abscissa of s i a n d s j according to fig 6a considering that 8 w a i min v s i s k k 1 2 n k i then the value of weight vector will be calculated as 9 w a i w a 1 w a 2 w a n t where ai i 1 2 n are n elements after the normalization process the weight vectors can be obtained using the following relation eq 10 10 w a i w a 1 w a 2 w a n t where w is a non fuzzy number 3 3 index of entropy the index of entropy ioe is a bivariate statistical method widely used in studies focusing on the assessment of natural hazards potential khosravi et al 2016 the selection of ioe to model the flood susceptibility within the study area is recommended by the highly accurate results provided by these methods in the previous studies related to the computation of susceptibility to natural hazards siahkamari et al 2018 tien bui et al 2018 costache and tien bui 2020 the entropy measures the disorders instability and uncertainty of a given system by using the index of entropy in the present study we consider that the entropy of a flood event represents the extent to which various factors determine the flood occurrence thus in the index of entropy the weight that each flood conditioning holds in flood potential index computation will be used the final weight for each variable wj can be determined as follows chen et al 2015 11 p ij fr ij i 1 s j fr ij where frij is the frequency ratio coefficient for each class category i of parameter j sj is the number of classes and pij is the probability density thus the probability pij is calculated for each class category of factor as the ratio between the fr value of that class category and the sum of frequency ratio values within a factor wang et al 2015 the frij is calculated as the ratio between the percentage of flood locations located in class category from the total number of flood locations and the percentage of a specific class category within the entire study area 12 h j i 1 s j p ij log 2 p ij j 1 2 n 13 h jmax log 2 s j 14 i j h jmax h j h jmax i 0 1 j 1 n 15 p j 1 s j i 1 s j fr ij 16 w j i j p j where hj and hjmax represent the entropy values ij is the information coefficient pj is the empirical probability and wj is the resultant weight value given to each flood factor the final values of the flood potential index were obtained through the ioe stand alone model by implementing the eq 17 in gis environments devkota et al 2013 17 fsi ioe i 1 n z m i c w j where i is the total number of flood conditioning factors z is the number of classes of the factor that owns the most classes mi is the number of classes of each specific factor c is the value of class after secondary classification and wj is the final weight of each factor 3 4 support vector machine being used in classification and regression problems support vector machine svm represents a machine learning model based on statistical learning theory and the structural risk minimization principle suykens and vandewalle 1999 svm is one of the most powerful machine learning methods whose efficiency in flood susceptibility mapping was demonstrated within the studies carried out during the last years choubin et al 2019 naghibi et al 2017 sachdeva et al 2017 the training data used in the svm model is divided using an optimal hyper plane it is to be noted that in a binary classification the optimal hyper plane is designed to widen the margin between classes pourghasemi et al 2013 the new data will be classified as soon as the hyper plane is obtained in this phase the original input space is being mapped into a high dimensional feature space tien bui et al 2012 in the present study we will take into account the pair xi yi with xi rm yi 1 0 and i 1 m where is a vector of the input space containing the altitude the distance from rivers land use soil classes ndvi slope angle sti lithology twi rainfall plan curvature and the slope aspect whilst y 1 represent the flood pixels presence and non flood pixels presence when y 0 the svm algorithm will be used to highlight the line which divides the most precise way that the flood and non flood pixels are located in a 2 d space if the training of the training data can be linearly separated the hyper plane could be defined as follows tien bui et al 2012 18 y i w x i b 1 ξ i where w is a coefficient vector that determines the orientation of the hyper plane in the feature space b represents the offset of the hyper plane from the origin and ξi is the positive slack variable tien bui et al 2012 the optimal hyperplane can be obtained by using the lagrange multipliers as follows tien bui et al 2012 19 minimize i 1 n α i 1 2 i j 1 n α i α j y i y j x i x j 20 s u b j e c t t o i 1 n α i y i 00 α i c where αi represents the lagrange multipliers and c is the penalty parameter that controls the trade off between the complexity of the decision function and the number of misclassified training examples costache 2019a the new data can be classified when the linear hyper plane is being used the classification can be obtained through the following relation 21 f x s i g n i 1 n y i α i x i b in the case when a non linear separable hyper plane is being required the original input will move into a high dimensional feature space therefore a non linear kernel function will be used the following relation will be used in order to classify the new data osuna and girosi 1998 22 f x i 1 n α i α i k x i x b therefore the αi and αi represent the lagrange multipliers αi 0 αi c and k xi xj represents the kernel function the open source machine learning weka software will be used for the training process of the svm fr and svm woe hybrid models for the calculation of the svm based hybrid models we will use the radial basis function one of the most efficient functions kavzoglu et al 2014 wechsler 2000 the following formulae represent the mathematical expression of the radial basis function tehrany et al 2015 23 k x i x j e x p γ x i x j γ 0 in which γ is the gamma term in the kernel function for all kernel types except the linear ones 4 the proposed methodology for predicting potential flood areas a sophisticated workflow including the use of 3 stand alone and 2 hybrid models was developed in order to estimate the flood potential across the study area the workflow is graphically described in fig 7 4 1 establishment of the flood database for the buzău river catchment it can be noted that the database required for the present research was constructed with the help of the arccatalog application thus along with the 12 flood conditioning factors the database comprises 205 flood locations in order to be more easily processed the data regarding the flood influencing factors were converted in raster format with a cell size of 30 30 m according to other studies tehrany et al 2014 a new sample with the absence of flood phenomena non flood locations has been generated this sample also contains 205 points which are placed in areas with high slopes or at high distances from the rivers where floods are less likely to occur 4 2 training data validation data and feature selection another essential step of the present analysis is the establishment of training and validating data thus the data used to train the flood potential models consists of the 12 flood influencing factors in raster format along with a specific percentage of the flood and non flood locations thus according to tehrany et al 2015 a percentage equal to 70 of the flood and non flood locations were used as the training sample while the other 30 of flood and non flood locations were used for results validation the training and validating samples were divided through the subset features tool implemented in gis software therefore a total number of 288 locations 144 floods and 144 non floods were included in the training sample while the other 122 locations 61 floods and 61 non floods was involved in the validation process it should be mentioned also that the flood locations were encoded with 1 and non flood locations were encoded with 0 in addition for a number of 8 flood predictors that are characterized by numerical values several descriptive statistics were computed table 1 it should be mentioned that the descriptive statistics were computed by using the flood and non flood points within the training and validating samples further as was stated at 3 1 the linear support vector machine algorithm was employed for feature selection thus in this step the entire flood and non flood sample together with the flood conditioning factors were used in weka software in order to determine the predictive ability for each geographical variable 4 3 configuration and training of flood models in terms of the ioe stand alone model the assessment of flood potential requires the calculation of the probability density pij for each factor class categories and the weights of flood conditioning factors in this regard the flood locations from the training sample were used in the first stage the pij and weights of flood conditioning factors were calculated using the eq 11 and 16 further the flood potential index was calculated by using the eq 17 in order to derive the flood potential index through the fahp stand alone model the analytical hierarchy process was used in the first step in order to calculate the weights of each factor class category thus the ahp weights were computed with the help of 12 comparison matrices that were generated in microsoft excel 2013 software the comparison matrix were constructed based on the human expert opinions it should be mentioned that a survey was sent by email to a number of 23 experts from the romanian waters national administration the experts provided their opinion regarding the hierarchy of the importance of the factor classes categories in terms of flood potential the entire procedure of ahp algorithm is presented in many scientific works pourghasemi et al 2013 yalcin 2008 yoshimatsu and abe 2006 all the ahp weights were assigned to each factor class category in gis environment the second step consisted in the construction of the fuzzy analytical hierarchy process evaluation matrix which was used in order to calculate the weights of each flood conditioning factor the final step in the computation of flood potential index through the fahp model was the multiplication of the flood conditioning factors raster having the ahp weights assigned with the weights derived from fahp model in terms of fahp ioe the flood potential was derived by the multiplication of ioe coefficients with the fahp weights the configuration of svm stand alone and svm ioe models was ensured through arcgis 10 5 and weka 9 3 software thus in the first step the information regarding the normalized values of flood conditioning factors and the ioe coefficients was extracted in gis environment for each flood and non flood location from the training sample further these data in csv tabular format were imported in weka software where the weights of each flood predictor were calculated by support vector machine algorithm it should be remarked that for both svm stand alone and svm ioe models the radial basis function was used it is very important to mention that the performance of the svm model will heavily depends on the correctness of estimation of the c and γ parameters cross validation was implied to establish the best values of these parameters c and γ for each of the two models therefore in terms of svm stand alone the c parameter obtained a value of 1 5 and the γ was equal to 0 16 while in terms of svm ioe the c parameter achieved a value of 1 8 whereas the γ parameter received a value of 0 13 4 4 performance evaluation of the flood models the roc curve model was involved in the results validation procedure within the majority of studies related to the assessment of potential to a natural hazard for a specific area khosravi et al 2018 razavi termeh et al 2018 siahkamari et al 2018 the roc curve graph is a technique for visualizing organizing and selecting classifiers based on their performance fawcett 2006 the roc curve is mainly used to judge the discrimination ability of the statistical models that combine different test results for predictive purposes hanley and mcneil 1982 the area under curve auc represent the main statistical indicator of roc curve the auc is used to measure the accuracy and the performance of the applied models bradley 1997 in the present research the roc curve will describe the capacity of the models to correctly predict the occurrence of the flood phenomena the graphical representation will be possible by plotting the sensitivity on y axis against the specificity on x axis the closer the value of auc gets to 1 the better the model is pallant 2016 the following equation can be used to calculate the auc values chen et al 2018 23 a u c t p t n p n where tp true positive represent the correctly classified flood pixels tn true negative represent the correctly classified non flood pixels p is the total number of flood pixels and n is the total number of non flood pixels in the present study both the succes rate and the prediction rate were constructed the success rate is a type of roc curve plot which highlights the model fitting rate and indicates how the flood potential index separates the flood locations within the susceptibility zones the prediction rate is also a type of roc curve plot which reveal the model performance in terms of the prediction of the future flood events vakhshoori and zare 2018 for the success rate the flood and non flood points from the training dataset were used while for the prediction rate the flood and non flood points from validating dataset along were involved in addition to the roc curve and auc the next statistical metrics were computed specificity sensitivity accuracy kappa index the specificity represents a statistical indicator which measures the proportion of non flood pixels that are correctly classified as non flood pixles baratloo et al 2015 the sensitivity represents a statistical index which measures the proportion of flood pixels that are classified as flood pixels baratloo et al 2015 the accuracy represents the ability of test to differentiate the flood and non flood pixels baratloo et al 2015 kappa index k is a statistical indicator that measures the agreement between two raters who each classify the total number of flood and non flood pixels into two exclusive categories flood and non flood respectively through the below written equation the aforementioned statistical measures could be determined 24 k p o p e 1 p e s e n s i t i v i t y t p t p f n s p e c i f i c i t y t n f p t n a c c u r a c y t p t n t p f p t n f n where fp false positive are the number of flood pixels erroneously classified and fn false negative are the number of non flood pixels erroneously classified k is kappa coefficient po is the observed flood pixels and pe is the estimated flood pixels according to queiroz et al 2016 if the values of the above indices exceed the threshold of 0 81 it is considered that there is almost a perfect agreement between the observed and the predicted values 5 results 5 1 predictiveness of the flood conditioning factors by using the linear support vector machine model the hierarchy of flood predictors in terms of the average merit am values were established in the present case the am is used as a conventional term in order to express the weights of factors calculated by linear support vector machine lsvm using weka software 9 3 thus the am values are equal to the weights calculated through lsvm this measure am highlights the level of the predictive ability of each flash flood predictor in terms of flood susceptibility the slope angle obtained the highest am 0 766 being followed by distance from rivers 0 668 land use 0 497 tpi 0 495 lithology 0 473 twi 0 41 convergence index 0 393 plan curvature 0 377 altitudes 0 356 rainfall 0 266 hydrological soil group 0 138 and aspect 0 089 fig 8 according to the results presented above all the flood conditioning factors have am values higher than 0 it should be noted that within the literature there is no general consensus regarding a specific threshold below which the variables should be removed from the analysis therefore since all the variables have a certain influence on flood genesis all the flood conditioning factors will be used in the analysis in order to determine the flood potential moreover we consider that in order to have a complete overview on the flood susceptibility across a specific region it is very important to take into consideration all the variables that has an influence on flood genesis however small that influence is 5 2 performance of the flood models the success rate and the prediction rate fig 9 a and b were employed to test the reliability and the accuracy of the proposed models 70 of the flood location training data was used to prepare the success rate while the other 30 validating data was involved in the construction of the prediction rate it can be noted that larger values of auc indicate a higher performance of the algorithms in terms of the success rate the results highlight that svm ioe with an auc 0 979 was the best model while fahp stand alone methods achieved the lowest performance auc 0 947 fig 9a further the results of prediction rate indicate that fahp ioe has the highest predictive ability auc 0 93 while the fahp method was again the weakest algorithm auc 0 909 fig 9b in the second stage the reliability of the results was verified by several statistical measures the use of the training data to calculate the indices mentioned above highlights the fact that the svm ioe model is the most performant of all this model achieved a value of 94 5 in the case of sensitivity which is higher than 93 8 obtained by fahp ioe also higher than 92 5 in the case of ioe stand alone the same situation can be observed in the case of specificity where the value of 95 8 achieved by svm ioe is higher than 94 4 fahp ioe and also higher than 93 7 ioe it can be noted that svm ioe achieved very good performances also in terms of accuracy 95 1 and kappa index 0 903 table 2 the use of the validating data revealed that svm ioe was the most performant model in the case of all statistical measures the svm ioe obtained the following results sensitivity 91 9 specificity 93 3 accuracy 92 6 and kappa index 0 852 5 3 flood modeling with index of entropy the first step of the application of ioe model consisted into calculating the frequency ratio fr values for each class category of factors the highest value of 10 7 fr coefficients was attributed to the twi class between 10 68 and 19 89 followed by the water bodies land use category fr 8 89 the distance from rivers between 0 and 50 m fr 6 35 and the built up areas land use category fr 4 52 it can be noted that 10 classes categories achieved fr value equal to 0 table 3 the fr values were employed to obtain the probability density pij the highest value of 0 7 was achieved by the twi class between 10 68 and 19 89 followed by the slope class between 3 1 and 7 pij 0 57 table 3 and the distance from rivers between 0 and 50 m pij 0 53 as in the case of the fr coefficients the same classes categories obtained a probability density equal to 0 after 5 following successive steps which implied the use of the probability density the weights of each flood conditioning factor were obtained the highest weight was held by the twi 2 51 followed by the land use 1 69 distance from rivers 1 22 tpi 1 06 slope 0 82 rainfall 0 67 hydrological soil groups 0 66 aspect 0 64 plan curvature 0 61 convergence index 0 6 elevation 0 6 and lithology 0 55 finally the fpiioe was obtained by multiplying the weights of the flood predictors with the ioe coefficients assigned to each class category the fpiioe fig 10 values ranging from 0 38 to 5 65 have been grouped into 5 classes defined by the natural breaks method the first class between 0 38 and 1 17 occupies 25 43 of the total study area and indicates the surfaces with very low flood potential the class between 1 17 and 1 68 covers about 32 13 of the total surface of the buzău river basin and emphasizes surfaces with low flood potential the medium values of fpiioe are distributed especially in the plainregion and represent about 30 the high and very high values of the fpiioe occupy about 12 5 of the buzău river basin and occur mainly along the main rivers of the study area 5 4 flood modeling with the fahp stand alone and fahp ioe the estimation of ahp weights for each class category of flood conditioning was the first step in the application of fahp stand alone model the ahp weights included in table 4 were obtained by constructing 12 pair wise comparison matrices for each flood conditioning factors the highest values of ahp weights 0 587 were assigned to plan curvature class between 0 11 and 0 48 table 4 followed by hydrological soil group d 0 582 convergence index class between 1 0 0 and 3 etc the construction of the fuzzy pairwise comparison matrix table 5 was the second step of the workflow developed through the fahp model thus the 12 criteria flood conditioning factors were compared within the matrix further the synthetic fuzzy values derived according to the methodology described at 4 3 3 were computed in order to be included in the calculation process of the final weights of flood predictors in this regard the analysis was performed according to the following steps 25 k 1 n j 1 n a kj 1 194 17254 58323 77 1 0 0030 0040 005 further the fuzzy number were compared by mean of the degree of possibility procedure the results of these comparisons are inserted in table 6 and were further used to determine the weight vector according to eq 26 and 27 26 w a i 0 53 0 43 0 49 0 09 0 05 1 0 03 0 16 0 07 0 04 0 03 0 02 t 27 w a i 0 196 0 157 0 179 0 033 0 018 0 367 0 011 0 058 0 025 0 146 0 011 0 007 t thus through the defuzzification process the tfns were converted into the values of the crisp weights which will later be assigned for each flood conditioning factor in order to estimate the flood potential as mentioned before within the methodology the fpifahp and fpifahp ioe values will be obtained by the multiplication of the crisp weight s values with the ahp and ioe coefficients fpifahp fig 11 a values ranging from 0 07 and 0 37 were split into 5 classes through natural breaks method the first class between 0 07 and 0 13 covers approximately 19 35 of the buzău river basin while the low values included in the second class are distributed on around 37 9 of the study area medium flood potential is encountered on 21 2 while the high and very high fpifahp values are spread over 21 5 of the entire study area the fpifahp ioe model fig 11 b with the values between 0 04 and 0 8 was classified into 5 classes using natural breaks method the first class ranging between 0 04 and 0 19 covers almost 27 of the study area especially in the mountainous areas whereas the small values of the fpifahp ioe ranging between 0 19 and 0 35 cover 31 55 of the research area fig 12 the average values of the fpifahp ioe occupy about 25 of the study area while the ivth and vth classes of fpi cover a total surface of 17 unlike in the fpiioe the high and very high values of fpifahp ioe occur in the transitioning areas from hilly region to the plain region 5 5 flood modeling with the svm stand alone and svm ioe in the first stage the svm stand alone model was used to determine the flood potential across the study area in this regard the values of flood conditioning factors and the flood and non flood points from the training samples were used as input data the determination of the weights for each flood predictor was optimized by the use of the two parameters represented by c 1 5 and γ 0 16 the slope angle was the most important factor 15 93 followed by distance from river 14 84 land use 11 68 tpi 11 35 lithology 8 47 rainfall 7 72 convergence index 6 04 elevation 5 71 hydrological soil group 4 52 twi 4 37 plan curvature 4 26 and aspect 3 69 fig 13 the application of svm ioe assumed the use of ioe coefficients as input data and a new estimation of the two parameters c 1 8 and γ 0 13 in this case the distance from rivers achieved the highest relative importance 17 63 followed by the slope angle 17 35 land use 13 06 lithology 10 26 tpi 9 24 rainfall 6 53 plan curvature 6 34 aspect 5 32 convergence index 5 32 elevation 4 66 hydrological soil groups 2 33 and the twi 1 96 fig 14 fpisvm values ranging from 0 06 to 0 33 were divided into five classes using the natural breaks method the very low flood potential is encountered on 16 13 of the study area while the low value of fpisvm can be found on 22 6 a percentage of 43 28 of the study area is covered by medium values of fpisvm while the high and very high flood potential appears on approximately 18 of buzău river basin further the fpisvm ioe values between 0 28 and 5 31 were divided into five classes using the same method like in the case of the previous four flood potential indices it is noted that from the total surface of the basin around 28 62 of the area is represented by the very low flood potential class and 31 23 of those with low potential the average values of the fpifahp ioe are present around 20 of the buzau river basin 6 discussion and conclusions the flood potential index for the buzău river catchment has been computed in past researches and has been done through various techniques that have shown different results the past researches have been based on a simpler analysis which involved the overlay of the conditioning factors without taking into account the locations of the historical floods it should be noted that the historical floods provide essential data in the detection of the areas prone to floods and their spread previous researches conducted by costache et al 2015 and zaharia et al 2017 have not attempted to validate the results through various validation methods as was made in the present study the results validation methods confirmed the high performance of the models which were employed to compute the flood potential index in the present research therefore we consider that the models could be used at a national scale for flood hazard mapping the idea that global climate change causes an increase in flood frequency is unanimously accepted by the international scientific world taking into account this consideration the assessment of certain territories from the flood susceptibility point of view represent a mandatory activity that should be included in the flood risk management the main result of the present study is represented by the values of flood potential index which were spatially modeled across the buzău river basin in order to derive the fpi values a number of three stand alone models index of entropy fuzzy analytical hierarchy process support vector machine and two hybrids fahp ioe and svm ioe were used the models were trained by using 144 flood and 144 non flood points which represent the dependent variables and 12 flood predictors representing the independent variables during the application of the methodological workflow there were achieved some auxiliary results represented by the ahp and ioe coefficients assigned to each factor class category or by the weight values of the flood predictors calculated through fahp and svm models these auxiliary results contributed to the achievement of the main result of the analysis it should be noted that seven flood conditioning factors were derived from databases that were obtained by applying remote sensing techniques so it should be noted the essential role which remote sensing holds in assessment of potential to different natural hazards it should be mentioned that after an initial evaluation of the predictive ability of the conditioning factors through the linear support vector machine method all 12 factors were further considered into the analysis the results of the analysis highlighted that the areas with a high and very high flood potential occupy between 13 fpiioe and 21 5 fpifahp of the study area the most prone areas are located near watercourses and also in the plain region where the slope is low the validation process shows that in terms of the success rate the hybrid svm ioe was the most performant model auc 0979 while in terms of prediction rate fahp ioe obtained the highest performance auc 0 93 given the fact that the buzau river basin is one of the most affected regions by floods in romania the results can be useful to the local authorities responsible for the management of emergency situations also since the methods used in this study have had a high performance rate they can represent a strong benchmark for future studies credit authorship contribution statement romulus costache conceptualization investigation data curation visualization
