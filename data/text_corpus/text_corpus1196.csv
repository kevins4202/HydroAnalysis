5980,the spatial characteristics of rills and non planar hillslope could dramatically alter the mechanisms of the hydrologic and geomorphic processes which were usually neglected in previous studies based on a two layer soil infiltration model a two dimensional 2d diffusion wave model and modified wepp erosion modeling approaches a 2d distributed hillslope runoff and soil erosion model was developed to account for these effects the interrill and rill areas are distinguished based on the high resolution topographic data the model is tested against experimental erosion data from a hillslope subjected to three successive rainfall events resulting in irregular rill networks good agreements between the modeled and observed results are found in runoff depth erosion and its spatial distribution a sensitivity analysis was also performed for the related parameters and found that the sensitive parameters for interrill erosion are rainfall intensity and interrill erodibility factor while the sensitive parameters for rill erosion are the rainfall intensity manning s friction coefficient rill erodibility factor and soil critical shear stress moreover the role of the dendritic rill network and concave hillslope have been examined and both of them can greatly affect the overland flow routing and increase the rill erosion which is not accounted for in previous models such as wepp these results are valuable for rainfall runoff and soil erosion prediction on irregularly rilled hillslopes keywords two dimensional distributed model rainfall runoff soil erosion dendritic rill

wainwright et al 2008 robichaud et al 2010 zhang et al 2014b cea et al 2016 chen et al 2016 wu et al 2017 2019 the numerical model has been increasingly necessary for the soil loss estimation and to deep understand the process however there are few or no distributed models capable of considering the spatial characteristics of rills and non planar hillslope at the plot scale in the literature thus addressing these weaknesses in hillslope runoff and soil erosion models would potentially improve the runoff and erosion prediction for natural hillslopes as an essential property of hillslope the rill erosion results in a series of depressions on the hillslope surface that function as ephemeral concentrated flow paths sediment source and sediment delivery system favis mortlock 1998 favis mortlock et al 2000 nord and esteves 2005 2007 shen et al 2015 zhang et al 2016 oz et al 2017 di stefano et al 2017a tian et al 2017 the spatial characteristics of rills e g the rill orientation angle the angle between the direction of a rill and the downstream direction of the slope and the local density width and depth of the rills have significant impacts on the hillslope runoff and soil erosion

angle is closely related to the upstream contributing area of each rill which can greatly affect the routing of flow and sediment from interrill areas to rills shen et al 2015 wu et al 2018 in addition an increase in the rill orientation angle can also increase the rill length and decrease rill slope gradient which consequently will change the rill flow hydraulics and rill erosion polyakov and nearing 2003 wang et al 2016 di stefano et al 2018 he et al 2018 moreover bruno et al 2008 and shen 2015 showed that rills emerge on the upper part of the hillslope and the density width and depth of the rills tend to increase towards downslope but finally decreases substantially near the hillslope outlet these variations result in the sequences of constrictions and expansions of total rill areas consequently the flow hydraulics and sediment entrainment and transport in each rill are spatially varied and unsteady which can also dramatically change the rill erosion and its spatial distribution govers et al 2007 liu et al 2007 papanicolaou et al 2010 hillslope shape is another important property that can affect the overland flow and erosion processes sweeney et al 2015 in general two common hillslope shapes in nature planar and concave may result in different runoff and erosion characteristics unlike on planar hillslopes the rills on laterally concave hillslopes tend to converge while extending downslope which can channel the overland flow rapidly from side zones to the center zone and increase the local rill flow shear stress and rill erosion to a great extent gordon et al 2012 schneider et al 2013 bennett et al 2015 oz et al 2017 although it is known that the spatial characteristics of rills and concave hillslope are two essential properties during the rainfall runoff and soil erosion processes there are few or no distributed models capable of reflecting complex rill network and hillslope shape at the plot or larger scales in the literature for example the universal soil loss equation usle presented by wischmeier and smith 1978 and the revised universal soil loss equation rusle by renard 1997 were historically the most widely used empirical models of soil erosion at the field scale they were developed using large amount of data that explain soil loss variations statistically the topographic factors of usle and rusle only include the slope length and slope gradient but neglect the spatial characteristics of rills and hillslope shape on a different track there have been attempts to model rainfall erosion using physical principles the widely used physically based model wepp foster et al 1995 defined the source term for erosion as the sum of a rill erosion rate and a delivery rate of sediment from interrill areas other physical models such as kineros smith et al 1995 eurosem morgan et al 1998 liu et al 2006 and wu et al 2017 also used this explicit distinction between rill and interrill source term of sediment the common shortcomings to these models are that the hillslope is treated as a planar surface and the rill network is represented by the same number of parallel identical uniformly distributed rills with average rill parameters an over simplification recently a few 2d hillslope runoff and soil erosion models attempted to consider the impacts of the spatial characteristics of rills and concave hillslope for instance govindaraju et al 1992 gottardi and venutelli 1993 tayfur et al 1993 jaber and mohtar 2003 liu et al 2004 howes et al 2006 chen et al 2013 and aksoy et al 2016 developed 2d overland flow models these models could reflect detailed spatial variability of hillslopes in rainfall runoff simulation but they either did not include a soil erosion module or did not distinguish the interrill and rill in erosion modeling tayfur 2007 and an and liu 2009 developed 1d and 2d coupling models to simulate the hillslope rainfall runoff and soil erosion processes they treated the hillslope as a combination of a 2d interrill area segmented by a series of 1d parallel rills however they did not consider the interaction among the rills and only applied to simple hillslopes that contained nearly parallel and continuous rills nord and esteves 2005 developed a 2d hillslope rainfall runoff and soil erosion model but could not distinguish explicitly between rills and interrill areas in general two main issues have remained unaddressed in previous studies i lack of an distributed modeling approach capable of reflecting the complex rill network and hillslope shape which may cause large errors in soil erosion prediction ii the impacts of the spatial structures of rills and hillslope shapes on rainfall runoff and soil erosion processes have not been examined which hinder the development of more targeted soil conservation strategies considering the spatial variability the objectives of this study were to 1 develop a 2d distributed model capable of modeling rainfall runoff and soil erosion processes on the irregularly rilled hillslope and 2 evaluate the impacts of the spatial characteristics of rills and concave hillslope on rainfall runoff and soil erosion these efforts are expected to produce a more accurate approach for soil erosion prediction on natural irregular hillslopes which can also contribute to the development of effective strategies to protect soils and alleviate the related environmental problems 2 modeling approach the proposed model in this paper consists of three modules an infiltration model capable of accounting for soils with a seal layer a two layer profile a 2d diffusion wave model capable of addressing spatial dynamics of rill and interrill flow and wepp erosion modeling approaches for interrill and rill erosion the combined model can be used to simulate rainfall runoff and soil erosion processes on an irregular rilled hillslope because the soil is susceptible to surface sealing during rainfall assouline 2004 the two layer infiltration model presented in smith et al 1993 1999 and corradini et al 1994 1997 2000 was applied in this study the governing equations read 1 c 1 ψ 0 d ψ 0 dt 1 a s z c i 0 k 0 k 1 s g 1 ψ c ψ 0 z

subscript i denotes quantities of initial conditions chen et al 2013 2016 have shown that the model is able to describe soil infiltration process on a hillslope with a sealing surface as an effective approximation of the st venant equations the diffusive wave approximation has been applied successfully to overland flow on hillslopes a 2d diffusive wave model proposed by chen et al 2013 was employed to describe overland flow on interrill areas the governing equations read as 4 h t q x x q y y p cos γ i 0 5 s 0 h s s f 6 q 1 n h 5 3 s f 1 2 q x q cos α f q y q sin α f where h is the flow depth m q x and q y are the x and y components of unit discharge q m2 s p is rainfall intensity m s i 0 is the infiltration rate through soil surface m s s 0 is the slope gradient s f is the friction slope s is the flow direction in the coordinate system m n is manning s friction coefficient and α f is the angle between s and x which can be determined by flow surface gradients in x and y coordinates previous studies have shown that the model performed well in simulating the runoff routing and reproduced accurately measured runoff resulting from an irregular hillslope chen et al 2013 2016 moreover for the rilled hillslope the sharp transition of slope occurs near the boundary between interrill and rill areas which can lead to the changes in hydraulic regimes strictly speaking the st venant equations and their approximations such as the diffusion wave cannot fully represent the rapidly varied flow near such boundaries because of the hydrostatic assumption in the local ruptures of slope such as hydraulic jumps or hydraulic drops caused by rapid topographic changes the dynamic pressure plays a role in flow hydraulics and 3d navier stokes n s equations should be used to fully resolve the problem however since these are local effects their zone of influence is limited and the effect may be effectively absorbed in the flow resistance in the models such as st venant and diffusion wave equations which can still be used as a good representation for the overall flow field in the overland flow and erosion simulation using the 3d n s equations is much beyond the current technology and is not necessary while the diffusion wave model remains a good practical approach in the present study because of its nature to smooth out local rapid changes wepp erosion modeling approaches provide a sophisticated and comprehensive platform for modeling hillslope erosion processes which represent the cutting edge theoretical understanding of the dynamics of hillslope soil erosion initiated by rainfall and has been validated and enhanced by a number of studies e g cochrane and flanagan 2003 2006 abaci and papanicolaou 2009 singh et al 2011 zhang et al 2014a brooks et al 2016 gonzález arqueros et al 2017 however wepp erosion modeling approaches are based on the 1d steady state sediment continuity equation that uses an average ratio between the rill spacing and rill width to simplify the complex rill network thus the approaches cannot accurately reflect the spatial characteristics of rills hillslope shape and the interaction of hydraulic and sediment transport processes between interrill areas and rills in the present study the interrill and rill regions were distinguished with an ultra fine resolution through the analysis of the topographic data before the simulation for instance takfing the 20 planar hillslope surface as a reference plane the elevations of rill area are negative and also much smaller than the elevations of interrill area a 2d soil erosion model was developed by expanding wepp erosion modeling approaches to two dimensions the mass balance equation for suspended sediment can be expresses as 7 hc t q x c x q y c y μ d i 1 μ d r where c is suspended sediment concentration kg m3 d i and d r are the interrill and rill erosion rate kg m2 s μ is the parameter that used to distinguish the rill and interrill areas on the hillslope μ 1 means the cell is belong to the interrill area while μ 0 means the cell belongs to the rill area based on wepp erosion modeling approaches the interrill erosion rate function can be expressed as follows bradford and foster 1996 zhang et al 1998 8 d i k i p r i f f nozzle r s r w where k i is adjusted interrill erodibility factor kg s m4 r is the rainfall excess rate m s i f is an interrill sediment delivery factor that incorporates the slope elliot et al 1989 f nozzle is an adjustment factor to account for sprinkler irrigation nozzle impact energy variation value of 1 0 for natural rainfall conditions rs is rill spacing m and r w is the width of the rill m for wepp model the term r s r w is used to convert di into a concentrated source of rills so that the model can use a unified treatment for interrill and rill erosion in a single sediment transport equation in this way sediment detached from the entire interrill area enters the rills immediately however in the present model the interrill and rill areas are distinguished explicitly for soil erosion simulation so that the term r s r w is not needed rill erosion rate may be either positive in the case of detachment or negative in the case of deposition rill detachment is predicted when the flow sediment load is below its transport capacity and flow shear stress acting on the soil exceeds critical shear stress in that case d r is predicted with 9 d r k r τ τ c 1 g t c where k r is adjusted rill erodibility factor s m τ is the rill flow shear stress which is given by the equation τ ρ g h s 0 pa τ c is adjusted soil critical shear stress pa g is sediment load of overland flow given by g q c kg m s and t c is flow sediment transport capacity kg m s the transport capacity t c as a function of flow shear stress is calculated using a simplified transport equation of the form yalin 1963 ferro 1998 10 t c k t τ 3 2 where k t is a transport coefficient m0 5 s2 kg0 5 deposition in rills is predicted when flow sediment load exceeds sediment transport capacity in this case the model predicts the rill erosion rate using 11 d r β v eff q t c g where β is a raindrop induced turbulence factor v eff is an effective fall velocity for the sediment which is about 0 568 mm s that calculated by zhang s formula with median particle diameter of lossies soil zhang and xie 1993 currently β is assigned a value of 0 5 for rain impacted flows flanagan and nearing 2000 note that as same as original wepp erosion modeling approaches the present soil erosion model is also a static modeling approach which cannot reflect the rill initiation and evolution processes 3 results and discussions 3 1 model calibration and verification the data set for evaluation of the model was obtained from experiments conducted in the state key laboratory of soil erosion and dryland farming on the loess plateau yangling china shen et al 2015 the experiments were conducted in a soil pan at 20 slope which was 10 m long 3 m wide and 0 5 m deep the soil for the experiment was the loessial soil with 28 3 sand 58 1 silt 13 6 clay and 5 9 g kg soil organic matter a downward spraying sprinkler rainfall simulator system was used to generate three successive rainfalls the rainfall intensity was set as 50 mm h and the rainfall duration was 60 min the turbid runoff samples were collected at the outlet to quantify the runoff depth and soil erosion moreover after each rainfall the rill width depth and density were measured in detail at cross sections along the slope with a 1 m distance interval and the rill erosion could be calculated from the variation of rill volume comparatively the interrill erosion was calculated by differing the total soil erosion and the rill erosion fig 1 shows the initial hillslope before the experiment and the hillslope topography after the three successive rainfalls named rill patterns 1 3 respectively shen et al 2015 it is evident that the rill network shows a great spatial variability for instance the locations of rill heads are not at the inlet of the flume but at about 1 m downstream of it before applying the model the soil infiltration runoff and erosion parameters are calibrated using the experimental data of the first rainfall which are summarized in table 1 it should be noted that due to the soil surface sealing the soil saturated hydraulic conductivity of top layer 1 0 cm in thickness soil k1s is different for the three successive rainfalls shen et al 2015 the k1s decreases from 2 9 cm h to 0 01 cm h during the first rainfall and remains 0 01 cm h for the second and third rainfalls while the soil saturated hydraulic conductivity of underlying layer soil k2s remains 2 9 cm h moreover the manning s roughness of interrill and rill areas are very difficult to determine separately with the available experimental data for this case without impairing the purpose of this study an effective roughness coefficient for both interrill and rill areas was applied for the shallow overland flow note that it is readily convenient to distinguish manning s n for interrill and rill areas as constant or time varying values in the present model when relevant information is available fig 2 gives a top view of the rill patterns after each rainfall and the relative hillslope elevation to the 20 planar slope the grid resolution and time step for the model were set to 0 05 0 1 m2 and 1 0 s respectively to eliminate the errors caused by neglecting the rill evolution process in the present model the elevation for each grid is used the average topographic data before and after the each rainfall event moreover to ensure the model convergence we did not intend to fully represent the details of microtopography at all scales on the slope including both interrill and rill areas although it may have an impact on local flow patterns or model convergence tayfur et al 1993 yang and chu 2015 habtezion et al 2016 instead the irregular patterns of rills were represented in an effective manner the rills are replaced by trapezoidal channels on the basis of the measured rill network planform and the average rill depth and width of different slope lengths the microtopography on the interrill areas is neglected since it is not the main focus of this study and the experiment setting was to minimize the impact of the microtopography although in general the 2d modeling approach is able to represent this surface property at scales larger than the size of grid cells thus the rill and interrill erosion areas can be automatically distinguished by comparing the elevations between three rilled hillslope and 20 planar hillslope with these parameters the above models were solved numerically using the standard runge kutta fourth order rk4 approach the finite volume total variation diminishing tvd maccormack scheme proposed by lin et al 2003 and the finite difference scheme moreover the sensitivity of the modeling results to computational time step has been examined by testing different time steps satisfying the courant friedrichs lewy cfl condition as an example the simulated cumulative soil erosion for δ t 0 01 0 1 and 1 0 s for the first rainfall are 262 94 262 94 and 262 44 kg respectively further reducing time step does not affect the results the conclusion was that the solutions presented are robust and not affected by the specific time step used fig 3 shows the comparison of cumulative runoff depth interrill and rill erosion intensity versus time between the model simulation and the observation of shen 2015 these results show that the present model reproduced the observed results fairly well for the cumulative runoff depth the maximum relative error is less than 5 which occurs at t 60 min for the case of rill pattern 3 for the interrill erosion according to shen 2015 the observed cumulative interrill erosion intensity for rill patterns 1 3 of three successive rainfalls are 3 3 2 6 and 1 9 kg m2 respectively while the simulated values are 3 2 2 9 and 2 3 kg m2 respectively by the present model the maximum difference between simulated and observed results is about 0 4 kg m2 the reasons of the overestimation of simulated interrill erosion are twofold on the one hand the soil sealing occurs during the rainfall events which tends to increase the interrill soil erodibility of the second and third rainfall events assouline and ben hur 2006 however the impact of soil sealing on the interrill erosion was not considered in the present model which tends to overestimate the interrill erosion of the second and third rainfall events on the other hand the adjusted interrill erodibility factor ki was calibrated and validated based on the interrill erosion of the first rainfall event because the model cannot account for the rill initiation and evolution processes the static rill pattern 1 was used to represent the rill evolution process during the first rainfall event which may increase the adjusted interrill erodibility factor and thus overestimate the interrill erosion for the second and third rainfall events for rill erosion intensity the simulated results in the end of each rainfall agree with the observations very well and the maximum relative difference is only 1 5 the small difference validates the present modeling approach in predicting the hillslope rainfall runoff and soil erosion processes however the trend of cumulative rill erosion intensity versus time predicted by the present model is slightly different with the observation with an increasing of rainfall duration the difference of cumulative rill erosion tends to increase during the first 30 min and then decrease markedly for the last 30 min this is mainly because the model does not consider the rill network evolution during the rainfall this assumption tends to overestimate the rill flow erosivity τ τ c 1 g t c and erosion at the first 30 min and then underestimates at the last 30 min fig 4 shows the simulated runoff rate and sediment yield rate versus time for the three successive rainfalls at the hillslope outlet for each rainfall event the rainfall intensity is 50 mm h and the rainfall duration is 60 min it is evident that the simulated runoff rates of the three rainfall events are fairly close to the measured values at different time while the simulated sediment yield rates versus time show different trends with the measured trends at small time the simulated sediment yield rate is a little larger than the measured value while at large time the simulated sediment yield rate tends to be a little smaller than the measured value this is because the present model does not consider the rill network evolution during the rainfall which tends to overestimate the rill flow erosivity and erosion at first and then underestimates them at last moreover note that the curves of runoff rate and sediment yield rate versus time follow a step function shape for rill pattern 1 which are rather different from those for rill patterns 2 and 3 this is possibly because the soil sealing occurs during the first rainfall event which can greatly modify the soil infiltration rate the runoff rate and the sediment yield rate previous studies only paid attention to the cumulative erosion and neglected the spatial distributions of hillslope runoff and soil erosion in reality the spatial distribution of soil erosion especially the rill erosion can provide a theoretical basis for formulating hillslope soil protection strategies thus the local rill erosion intensity defined here as the rill erosion per unit slope area along the slope length and quantified by measuring the topographic changes of rills is also used to verify the model note that the observed local rill erosion intensity is obtained every 1 0 m along the slope length while the simulated local rill erosion intensity is obtained for every 0 1 m along the slope length the local rill erosion intensity versus the slope length at the end of the three successive rainfalls is illustrated in fig 5 the results show that the simulated local rill erosion intensity for rill patterns 1 3 by the present model are all fairly close to the observed values and the root mean squared errors rmses are very small about 0 77 2 33 and 1 9 for rill patterns 1 3 respectively it indicates that the present model is able to simulate the spatial distribution of rill erosion accurately with changing rill characteristics the local rill erosion intensity does not vary monotonically with slope length and the maximum value does not occur at the hillslope outlet but in the middle of the lower half of the slope this is likely because the actual number of rills and rill flow erosivity vary significantly along the hillslope the number of rills near the outlet is greatly reduced and limited the local sediment transport capacity although the rill flow erosivity reaches its maximum value there similar results could also be found during rill development as shown in many field and laboratory experiments e g rejman and brodowski 2005 bruno et al 2008 schneider et al 2013 shen 2015 vinci et al 2015 zhang et al 2016 tian et al 2017 taking rill pattern 3 as an example fig 6 illustrates a map of simulated flow depth and cumulative soil erosion at t 60 min respectively it is evident that the concentrated overland flow is located in the rill regions and the difference between the maximum and minimum flow depths is close to 4 mm see fig 6a with the increase of flow length the rill flow depth first increases rapidly and then decreases near the hillslope outlet because of the discontinuous rills and the smaller rill depth comparatively the variation of interrill flow depth is very small it first increases monotonically with slope length at the upslope when the interrill runoff comes across a rill the interrill flow is delivered to the rill and the runoff depth of interrill flow decreases to near zero for the soil erosion the interrill areas suffer a low rate uniform erosion in the white areas shown in fig 6b this is because the interrill erosion is determined by the rainfall intensity and rainfall excess rate which do not show great spatial variability the intensive rill erosion area is located at the lower middle slope because of the high rill flow erosivity there in different rills the flow depth and erosion show great spatial variability even at the same slope length the flow depth and erosion are relatively larger for the hillslope with continuous and oblique rills because the interrill flow is easier to converge than the discontinuous and straight rills in addition note that the rill erosion does not change continuously in a small part of rill areas see fig 6b this is because the rill grids connect each other in x or y direction in the model simulation the slope gradient in y direction is steeper than in x direction and thus the rill grids connected in y direction suffers more severe erosion overall this example shows that the model is capable of reproducing the spatial and temporal variations of hydrological and erosion processes on hillslope surfaces with complex and changing rill network its capability allows the efforts of erosion modeling to be extended to irregularly rilled hillslopes and to provide detailed characteristics of hillslope runoff and soil erosion processes for developing reasonable soil conservation strategies 3 2 sensitive analysis a sensitivity analysis is carried out to determine how the variations of the rainfall soil runoff and erosion parameters e g p k 1 s θ 1 i n k i k r τ c and k t affect the interrill and rill erosion among these parameters k r τ c and k t are only related to rill erosion because the rainfall soil infiltration runoff interrill erosion and rill erosion parameters of present model are generally independent of each other the sensitivity analysis is performed by changing the value of one single parameter at a time and remaining the others constant as given in table 1 taking rill pattern 3 as an example the values of the cumulative interrill and rill erosion are compared with the reference values obtained using the set of calibrated parameters all the results are plotted in fig 7 for the interrill erosion the most sensitive parameters are p and ki the result exhibits a nearly power law increase in the cumulative interrill erosion with the increase in p which means the increase of interrill erosion becomes more prominent with increasing rainfall intensity for example an increase of 50 of p makes rise cumulative interrill erosion within the range of 76 1 126 9 this is because the increase of rainfall intensity also increases the rainfall excess rate which has dual effects on the interrill erosion rate as shown in eq 8 with an increasing of ki the cumulative interrill erosion increases linearly an increase of 50 of ki leads to an increase of cumulative interrill erosion of 50 comparatively the effects of k 1 s θ 1 i and n are not very sensitive a 50 variations of k 1 s θ 1 i and n only change the cumulative interrill erosion by less than 1 the main reason is that the soil infiltrability is much less than the rainfall intensity due to the soil sealing and thus the effects of variation of k 1 s θ 1 i and n on rainfall excess rate is not significant comparatively more parameters affect rill erosion k r is the most sensitive parameter tested and an increase of 100 of k r makes rise cumulative rill erosion of about 100 variation of rill erosion with k r is linear since the rill detachment rate is a linear function of k r as expressed in eq 9 τ c is a threshold value of shear stress under which no detachment by flow takes place decreasing τ c results in a slight increase in the cumulative rill erosion this is because although the decrease of τ c tends to increase the dr the flow sediment transport capacity tc restrains the increase of dr to a great extent comparatively with an increasing of τ c the cumulative rill erosion decreases drastically it can be deduced that τ c is a very sensitive parameter for rill erosion the impact of k t on rill erosion tends to become more prominent for smaller k t because it controls the transport capacity the sediment concentration parameter n is a factor accounting for surface roughness which is slightly less sensitive than that of k r when n rises the rill flow depth rises which leads to an increase in the shear stress and the rill flow erosivity it should be noted that the interrill erodibility factor can also affect the rill erosion with an increase of k i the rill erosion tends to decrease gradually this is because the soil generated from interrill area was transported through rills which tends to decrease the rill erosion rate as expressed in eq 9 the rill erosion is also very sensitive to rainfall intensity p an increase of 50 of p leads to an increase of 16 40 of rill erosion in contrast the soil infiltration parameters k 1 s and θ 1 i are not sensitive parameters and the major effects of the variation of k 1 s and θ 1 i are a decrease of rill erosion of less than 1 this is likely because the variation of soil infiltrability is much smaller than the rainfall intensity in this case in conclusion sensitive parameters for the cumulative interrill erosion are the rainfall intensity and interrill erodibility factor while the soil hydraulic conductivity initial soil water content and surface roughness have minor impacts on the interrill erosion for rill erosion sensitive parameters are rainfall intensity surface roughness soil critical shear stress and rill erodibility factor 3 3 effects of dendritic rill patterns and concave hillslope both the dendritic rills and concave hillslope are supposed to drastically affect the soil erosion processes e g michaelides et al 2010 gordon et al 2012 schneider et al 2013 bennett et al 2015 zhang et al 2016 oz et al 2017 qin et al 2017 tian et al 2017 to examine the hypotheses both the present model and wepp are applied to the four artificial rilled plots as shown in fig 8 note that wepp applied in the present study adopts the same infiltration runoff and soil erosion modeling theory as the present model the main difference is that wepp simulates the hillslope rainfall runoff and soil erosion processes in 1d and cannot reflect the impacts of the dendritic rills and concave hillslope it neglects the convergence processes of overland flow and assumes all rainfall excess generated from interrill areas is delivered into the rills immediately plot 1 includes a single parallel rill on a planar hillslope plot 2 shows a y shaped dendritic rill network on a planar hillslope plot 3 shows a single parallel rill on a concave hillslope and plot 4 shows a y shaped dendritic rill network on a concave hillslope considering the rainfall and soil characteristics are the same with the laboratory experiments the parameters of the present model are equal to these of rill pattern 3 see table 1 for wepp most parameters remain the same with the present model excepting the interrill and rill erodibility factors these two factors are calibrated again using the simulated results of plot 1 by the present model thus we can compare the simulated results between the present model and wepp to illustrate the impacts of dendritic rills and concave hillslope on soil erosion prediction fig 9 shows a map of simulated overland flow depth and cumulative soil erosion at t 60 min for the plot 1 very few rainfall excesses generated from interrill areas are delivered into the rill this is because the routing of overland flow to the parallel rill can be only from adjacent interrill areas the highest values of erosion intensity are located in the rill area where the concentrated overland flow occurs as seen in fig 9e with an increasing of slope length both the rill flow depth and rill erosion intensity tend to increase monotonically the maximum rill flow depth and erosion intensity are about 2 7 mm and 128 kg m2 respectively for the y shaped rills in plot 2 the excess rainfall and sediment generated from upstream interrill areas are delivered downslope into rills intercepting the interrill flow pathways and much more interrill flow and sediment can converge into the rills the maximum rill flow depth and erosion intensity increase to 5 8 mm and 370 kg m2 respectively comparatively for the plots 3 and 4 the concave hillslope surface can also benefit the interrill runoff and sediment concentrating into the rill from two lateral interrill areas the maximum rill flow depth and erosion intensity are almost the same for both plots 3 and 4 which are 8 2 mm and 614 kg m2 respectively this example suggests that the dendritic rills and concave hillslope can significantly contribute to the flow convergence and rill erosion which however cannot be addressed in previous models moreover the results show that the rill flow depth and rill erosion rate in the two side zones of plot 4 are slightly less than plot 2 this is because concave hillslopes can more quickly concentrate excess rainfall generated from interrill areas to the middle depression zone as shown in fig 9d which tends to decrease the rill flow depth and erosion intensity in the side zones to examine the differences between the present model and the wepp approach fig 10 shows the simulated cumulative interrill and rill erosion versus time for plots 1 4 by using both the present model and wepp because plots 1 4 have the same average ratio of rill spacing and rill width the interrill and rill erosion simulated by wepp do not change for plots 1 4 for interrill erosion it can be found that the simulated interrill erosion by the present model and wepp are almost the same for plots 1 and 2 comparatively there is a minor difference between the present model and wepp for plots 3 and 4 this is because the concave hillslope surface is more convenient for flow concentrated in the depression area and the rainfall excess rate is larger than that in the planar hillslope for rill erosion the cumulative rill erosion simulated by wepp is much smaller than that simulated by the present model for plots 2 4 and the differences tend to increase with rainfall duration for example the differences for plot 2 at t 20 40 and 60 min are 100 34 204 11 and 307 94 kg respectively which are quite close to those of plots 3 and 4 this is mainly because wepp assumed all the excess rainfall generated from the interrill areas are delivered to the rills directly the assumption of wepp will underestimate the calibrated erodibility factor and the rill erosion to a great extent moreover although the maximum rill erosion intensity occurs in the cases of plot 3 and 4 as shown in fig 9 the cumulative rill erosion of plot 2 is slightly larger than plots 3 and 4 it implies that either the dendritic rills or concave hillslope can drastically increase the rill erosion while their combined impacts make the cumulative rill erosion slightly less than the case of either the dendritic rills or concave hillslope this is because the impacts of concave hillslope are twofold on the one hand it can contribute to the flow convergence and increase the rill flow erosivity and erosion in the central depression zone on the other hand the concentrated overland flow of concave hillslope tends to decrease the rill flow depth and erosion in the two lateral zones of the hillslope thus for a concave hillslope with dentritic rills the concave hillslope tends to decrease the rill flow erosivity and rill erosion in two lateral zones of the hillslope see fig 9h overall because rill erosion always accounts for a large proportion of hillslope soil erosion it can be concluded that wepp cannot be equally accurate in predicting soil erosion with changing rill planform or hillslope shape by using the same set of model parameters 4 conclusions based on a two layer soil infiltration model a 2d diffusive wave overland flow model and wepp erosion modeling approaches a 2d physical model for infiltration overland flow and erosion at the plot scale is presented this distributed model can be applied to natural non planar hillslopes with changing rill networks the interrill and rill areas are distinguished prior to the simulation according to the topographic data which can address the spatially intricate partitioning of interrill and rill flow automatically and improve the rill hydraulics and erosion prediction the model is validated against laboratory observed rainfall runoff and soil erosion data for three different rill patterns and good agreements are found in runoff depth soil erosion and its spatial distribution for different rills on the hillslope the flow depth and erosion show great variability even at the same slope length the flow depth and erosion are much larger in continuous oblique rills because the interrill flow easily converges into the oblique rills and the rill flow cannot exit the continuous rills to return to the interrill areas the cumulative interrill erosion increases substantially with the rainfall intensity and interrill erodibility factor but varies slightly with the soil hydraulic conductivity initial soil water content and surface roughness for rill erosion the sensitive parameters are rainfall intensity surface roughness soil critical shear stress and rill erodibility factor the dendritic pattern of rills and concave hillslope shape can drastically affect the hillslope rainfall runoff and soil erosion processes both properties can contribute to the channelization of overland flow and increase the rill flow erosivity and erosion to a great extent the proposed model predicts the hillslope soil erosion in consistent accuracy for the changing rill network or hillslope shape by using the same set of model parameters which cannot be achieved with the wepp approach declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared

5980,the spatial characteristics of rills and non planar hillslope could dramatically alter the mechanisms of the hydrologic and geomorphic processes which were usually neglected in previous studies based on a two layer soil infiltration model a two dimensional 2d diffusion wave model and modified wepp erosion modeling approaches a 2d distributed hillslope runoff and soil erosion model was developed to account for these effects the interrill and rill areas are distinguished based on the high resolution topographic data the model is tested against experimental erosion data from a hillslope subjected to three successive rainfall events resulting in irregular rill networks good agreements between the modeled and observed results are found in runoff depth erosion and its spatial distribution a sensitivity analysis was also performed for the related parameters and found that the sensitive parameters for interrill erosion are rainfall intensity and interrill erodibility factor while the sensitive parameters for rill erosion are the rainfall intensity manning s friction coefficient rill erodibility factor and soil critical shear stress moreover the role of the dendritic rill network and concave hillslope have been examined and both of them can greatly affect the overland flow routing and increase the rill erosion which is not accounted for in previous models such as wepp these results are valuable for rainfall runoff and soil erosion prediction on irregularly rilled hillslopes keywords two dimensional distributed model rainfall runoff soil erosion dendritic rill

wainwright et al 2008 robichaud et al 2010 zhang et al 2014b cea et al 2016 chen et al 2016 wu et al 2017 2019 the numerical model has been increasingly necessary for the soil loss estimation and to deep understand the process however there are few or no distributed models capable of considering the spatial characteristics of rills and non planar hillslope at the plot scale in the literature thus addressing these weaknesses in hillslope runoff and soil erosion models would potentially improve the runoff and erosion prediction for natural hillslopes as an essential property of hillslope the rill erosion results in a series of depressions on the hillslope surface that function as ephemeral concentrated flow paths sediment source and sediment delivery system favis mortlock 1998 favis mortlock et al 2000 nord and esteves 2005 2007 shen et al 2015 zhang et al 2016 oz et al 2017 di stefano et al 2017a tian et al 2017 the spatial characteristics of rills e g the rill orientation angle the angle between the direction of a rill and the downstream direction of the slope and the local density width and depth of the rills have significant impacts on the hillslope runoff and soil erosion

angle is closely related to the upstream contributing area of each rill which can greatly affect the routing of flow and sediment from interrill areas to rills shen et al 2015 wu et al 2018 in addition an increase in the rill orientation angle can also increase the rill length and decrease rill slope gradient which consequently will change the rill flow hydraulics and rill erosion polyakov and nearing 2003 wang et al 2016 di stefano et al 2018 he et al 2018 moreover bruno et al 2008 and shen 2015 showed that rills emerge on the upper part of the hillslope and the density width and depth of the rills tend to increase towards downslope but finally decreases substantially near the hillslope outlet these variations result in the sequences of constrictions and expansions of total rill areas consequently the flow hydraulics and sediment entrainment and transport in each rill are spatially varied and unsteady which can also dramatically change the rill erosion and its spatial distribution govers et al 2007 liu et al 2007 papanicolaou et al 2010 hillslope shape is another important property that can affect the overland flow and erosion processes sweeney et al 2015 in general two common hillslope shapes in nature planar and concave may result in different runoff and erosion characteristics unlike on planar hillslopes the rills on laterally concave hillslopes tend to converge while extending downslope which can channel the overland flow rapidly from side zones to the center zone and increase the local rill flow shear stress and rill erosion to a great extent gordon et al 2012 schneider et al 2013 bennett et al 2015 oz et al 2017 although it is known that the spatial characteristics of rills and concave hillslope are two essential properties during the rainfall runoff and soil erosion processes there are few or no distributed models capable of reflecting complex rill network and hillslope shape at the plot or larger scales in the literature for example the universal soil loss equation usle presented by wischmeier and smith 1978 and the revised universal soil loss equation rusle by renard 1997 were historically the most widely used empirical models of soil erosion at the field scale they were developed using large amount of data that explain soil loss variations statistically the topographic factors of usle and rusle only include the slope length and slope gradient but neglect the spatial characteristics of rills and hillslope shape on a different track there have been attempts to model rainfall erosion using physical principles the widely used physically based model wepp foster et al 1995 defined the source term for erosion as the sum of a rill erosion rate and a delivery rate of sediment from interrill areas other physical models such as kineros smith et al 1995 eurosem morgan et al 1998 liu et al 2006 and wu et al 2017 also used this explicit distinction between rill and interrill source term of sediment the common shortcomings to these models are that the hillslope is treated as a planar surface and the rill network is represented by the same number of parallel identical uniformly distributed rills with average rill parameters an over simplification recently a few 2d hillslope runoff and soil erosion models attempted to consider the impacts of the spatial characteristics of rills and concave hillslope for instance govindaraju et al 1992 gottardi and venutelli 1993 tayfur et al 1993 jaber and mohtar 2003 liu et al 2004 howes et al 2006 chen et al 2013 and aksoy et al 2016 developed 2d overland flow models these models could reflect detailed spatial variability of hillslopes in rainfall runoff simulation but they either did not include a soil erosion module or did not distinguish the interrill and rill in erosion modeling tayfur 2007 and an and liu 2009 developed 1d and 2d coupling models to simulate the hillslope rainfall runoff and soil erosion processes they treated the hillslope as a combination of a 2d interrill area segmented by a series of 1d parallel rills however they did not consider the interaction among the rills and only applied to simple hillslopes that contained nearly parallel and continuous rills nord and esteves 2005 developed a 2d hillslope rainfall runoff and soil erosion model but could not distinguish explicitly between rills and interrill areas in general two main issues have remained unaddressed in previous studies i lack of an distributed modeling approach capable of reflecting the complex rill network and hillslope shape which may cause large errors in soil erosion prediction ii the impacts of the spatial structures of rills and hillslope shapes on rainfall runoff and soil erosion processes have not been examined which hinder the development of more targeted soil conservation strategies considering the spatial variability the objectives of this study were to 1 develop a 2d distributed model capable of modeling rainfall runoff and soil erosion processes on the irregularly rilled hillslope and 2 evaluate the impacts of the spatial characteristics of rills and concave hillslope on rainfall runoff and soil erosion these efforts are expected to produce a more accurate approach for soil erosion prediction on natural irregular hillslopes which can also contribute to the development of effective strategies to protect soils and alleviate the related environmental problems 2 modeling approach the proposed model in this paper consists of three modules an infiltration model capable of accounting for soils with a seal layer a two layer profile a 2d diffusion wave model capable of addressing spatial dynamics of rill and interrill flow and wepp erosion modeling approaches for interrill and rill erosion the combined model can be used to simulate rainfall runoff and soil erosion processes on an irregular rilled hillslope because the soil is susceptible to surface sealing during rainfall assouline 2004 the two layer

approximation of the st venant equations the diffusive wave approximation has been applied successfully to overland flow on hillslopes a 2d diffusive wave model proposed by chen et al 2013 was employed to describe overland flow on interrill areas the governing equations read as 4 h t q x x q y y p cos γ i 0 5 s 0 h s s f 6 q 1 n h 5 3 s f 1 2 q x q cos α f q y q sin α f where h is the flow

slope s is the flow direction in the coordinate system m n is manning s friction coefficient and α f is the angle between s and x which can be determined by flow surface gradients in x and y coordinates previous studies have shown that the model performed well in simulating the runoff routing and reproduced accurately measured runoff resulting from an irregular hillslope chen et al 2013 2016 moreover for the rilled hillslope the sharp transition of slope occurs near the boundary between interrill and rill areas which can lead to the changes in hydraulic regimes strictly speaking the st venant equations and their approximations such as the diffusion wave cannot fully represent the rapidly varied flow near such boundaries because of the hydrostatic assumption in the local ruptures of slope such as hydraulic jumps or hydraulic drops caused by rapid topographic changes the dynamic pressure plays a role in flow hydraulics and 3d navier stokes n s equations should be used to fully resolve the problem however since these are local effects their zone of influence is limited and the effect may be effectively absorbed in the flow resistance in the models such as st venant and diffusion wave equations which can still be used as a good representation for the overall flow field in the overland flow and erosion simulation using the 3d n s equations is much beyond the current technology and is not necessary while the diffusion wave model remains a good practical approach in the present study because of its nature to smooth out local rapid changes wepp erosion modeling approaches provide a sophisticated and comprehensive platform for modeling hillslope erosion processes which represent the cutting edge theoretical understanding of the dynamics of hillslope soil erosion initiated by rainfall and has been validated and enhanced by a number of studies e g cochrane and flanagan 2003 2006 abaci and papanicolaou 2009 singh et al 2011 zhang et al 2014a brooks et al 2016 gonzález arqueros et al 2017 however wepp erosion modeling approaches are based on the 1d steady state sediment continuity equation that uses an average ratio between the rill spacing and rill width to simplify the complex rill network thus the approaches cannot accurately reflect the spatial characteristics of rills hillslope shape and the interaction of hydraulic and sediment transport processes between interrill areas and rills in the present study the interrill and rill regions were distinguished with an ultra fine resolution through the analysis of the topographic data before the simulation for instance takfing the 20 planar hillslope surface as a reference plane the elevations of rill area are negative and also much smaller than the elevations of interrill area a 2d soil erosion model was developed by expanding wepp erosion modeling approaches to two dimensions the mass balance equation for suspended sediment can be expresses as 7 hc t q x c x q y c y μ d i 1 μ d r where c is suspended sediment concentration kg m3 d i and d r are the interrill and rill erosion rate kg m2 s μ is the parameter that used to distinguish the rill and interrill areas on the hillslope μ 1 means the cell is belong to the interrill area while μ 0 means the cell belongs to the rill area based on wepp erosion modeling approaches the interrill erosion rate function can be expressed as follows bradford and foster 1996 zhang et al 1998 8 d i k i p r i f f nozzle r s r w where k i is adjusted interrill erodibility factor kg s m4 r is the rainfall excess rate m s i f is an interrill sediment delivery factor that incorporates the slope elliot et al 1989 f nozzle is an adjustment factor to account for sprinkler irrigation nozzle impact energy variation value of 1 0 for natural rainfall conditions rs is rill spacing m and r w is the width of the rill m for wepp model the term r s r w is used to convert di into a concentrated source of rills so that the model can use a unified treatment for interrill and rill erosion in a single sediment transport equation in this way sediment detached from the entire interrill area enters the rills immediately however in the present model the interrill and rill areas are distinguished explicitly for soil erosion simulation so that the term r s r w is not needed rill erosion rate may be either positive in the case of detachment or negative in the case of deposition rill detachment is predicted when the flow sediment load is below its transport capacity and flow shear stress acting on the soil exceeds critical shear stress in that case d r is predicted with 9 d r k r τ τ c 1 g t c where k r is adjusted rill erodibility factor s m τ is the rill flow shear stress which is given by the equation τ ρ g h s 0 pa τ c is adjusted soil critical shear stress pa g is sediment load of overland flow given by g q c kg m s and t c is flow sediment transport capacity kg m s the transport capacity t c as a function of flow shear stress is calculated using a simplified transport equation of the form yalin 1963 ferro 1998 10 t c k t τ 3 2 where k t is a transport coefficient m0 5 s2 kg0 5 deposition in rills is predicted when flow sediment load exceeds sediment transport capacity in this case the model predicts the rill erosion rate using 11 d r β v eff q t c g where β is a raindrop induced turbulence factor v eff is an effective fall velocity for the sediment which is about 0 568 mm s that calculated by zhang s formula with median particle diameter of lossies soil zhang and xie 1993 currently β is assigned a value of 0 5 for rain impacted flows flanagan and nearing 2000 note that as same as original wepp erosion modeling approaches the present soil erosion model is also a static modeling approach which cannot reflect the rill initiation and evolution processes 3 results and discussions 3 1 model calibration and verification the data set for evaluation of the model was obtained from experiments conducted in the state key laboratory of soil erosion and dryland farming on the loess plateau yangling china shen et al 2015 the experiments were conducted in a soil pan at 20 slope which was 10 m long 3 m wide and 0 5 m deep the soil for the experiment was the loessial soil with 28 3 sand 58 1 silt 13 6 clay and 5 9 g kg soil organic matter a downward spraying sprinkler rainfall simulator system was used to generate three successive rainfalls the rainfall intensity was set as 50 mm h and the rainfall duration was 60 min the turbid runoff samples were collected at the outlet to quantify the runoff depth and soil erosion moreover after each rainfall the rill width depth and density were measured in detail at cross sections along the slope with a 1 m distance interval and the rill erosion could be calculated from the variation of rill volume comparatively the interrill erosion was calculated by differing the total soil erosion and the rill erosion fig 1 shows the initial hillslope before the experiment and the hillslope topography after the three successive rainfalls named rill patterns 1 3 respectively shen et al 2015 it is evident that the rill network shows a great spatial variability for instance the locations of rill heads are not at the inlet of the flume but at about 1 m downstream of it before applying the model the soil infiltration runoff and erosion parameters are calibrated using the experimental data of the first rainfall which are summarized in table 1 it should be noted that due to the soil surface sealing the soil saturated hydraulic conductivity of top layer 1 0 cm in thickness soil k1s is different for the three successive rainfalls shen et al 2015 the k1s decreases from 2 9 cm h to 0 01 cm h during the first rainfall and remains 0 01 cm h for the second and third rainfalls while the soil saturated hydraulic conductivity of underlying layer soil k2s remains 2 9 cm h moreover the manning s roughness of interrill and rill areas are very difficult to determine separately with the available experimental data for this case without impairing the purpose of this study an effective roughness coefficient for both interrill and rill areas was applied for the shallow overland flow note that it is readily convenient to distinguish manning s n for interrill and rill areas as constant or time varying values in the present model when relevant information is available fig 2 gives a top view of the rill patterns after each rainfall and the relative hillslope elevation to the 20 planar slope the grid resolution and time step for the model were set to 0 05 0 1 m2 and 1 0 s respectively to eliminate the errors caused by neglecting the rill evolution process in the present model the elevation for each grid is used the average topographic data before and after the each rainfall event moreover to ensure the model convergence we did not intend to fully represent the details of microtopography at all scales on the slope including both interrill and rill areas although it may have an impact on local flow patterns or model convergence tayfur et al 1993 yang and chu 2015 habtezion et al 2016 instead the irregular patterns of rills were represented in an effective manner the rills are replaced by trapezoidal channels on the basis of the measured rill network planform and the average rill depth and width of different slope lengths the microtopography on the interrill areas is neglected since it is not the main focus of this study and the experiment setting was to minimize the impact of the microtopography although in general the 2d modeling approach is able to represent this surface property at scales larger than the size of grid cells thus the rill and interrill erosion areas can be automatically distinguished by comparing the elevations between three rilled hillslope and 20 planar hillslope with these parameters the above models were solved numerically using the standard runge kutta fourth order rk4 approach the finite volume total variation diminishing tvd maccormack scheme proposed by lin et al 2003 and the finite difference scheme moreover the sensitivity of the modeling results to computational time step has been examined by testing different time steps satisfying the courant friedrichs lewy cfl condition as an example the simulated cumulative soil erosion for δ t 0 01 0 1 and 1 0 s for the first rainfall are 262 94 262 94 and 262 44 kg respectively further reducing time step does not affect the results the conclusion was that the solutions presented are robust and not affected by the specific time step used fig 3 shows the comparison of cumulative runoff depth interrill and rill erosion intensity versus time between the model simulation and the observation of shen 2015 these results show that the present model reproduced the observed results fairly well for the cumulative runoff depth the maximum relative error is less than 5 which occurs at t 60 min for the case of rill pattern 3 for the interrill erosion according to shen 2015 the observed cumulative interrill erosion intensity for rill patterns 1 3 of three successive rainfalls are 3 3 2 6 and 1 9 kg m2 respectively while the simulated values are 3 2 2 9 and 2 3 kg m2 respectively by the present model the maximum difference between simulated and observed results is about 0 4 kg m2 the reasons of the overestimation of simulated interrill erosion are twofold on the one hand the soil sealing occurs during the rainfall events which tends to increase the interrill soil erodibility of the second and third rainfall events assouline and ben hur 2006 however the impact of soil sealing on the interrill erosion was not considered in the present model which tends to overestimate the interrill erosion of the second and third rainfall events on the other hand the adjusted interrill erodibility factor ki was calibrated and validated based on the interrill erosion of the first rainfall event because the model cannot account for the rill initiation and evolution processes the static rill pattern 1 was used to represent the rill evolution process during the first rainfall event which may increase the adjusted interrill erodibility factor and thus overestimate the interrill erosion for the second and third rainfall events for rill erosion intensity the simulated results in the end of each rainfall agree with the observations very well and the maximum relative difference is only 1 5 the small difference validates the present modeling approach in predicting the hillslope rainfall runoff and soil erosion processes however the trend of cumulative rill erosion intensity versus time predicted by the present model is slightly different with the observation with an increasing of rainfall duration the difference of cumulative rill erosion tends to increase during the first 30 min and then decrease markedly for the last 30 min this is mainly because the model does not consider the rill network evolution during the rainfall this assumption tends to overestimate the rill flow erosivity τ τ c 1 g t c and erosion at the first 30 min and then underestimates at the last 30 min fig 4 shows the simulated runoff rate and sediment yield rate versus time for the three successive rainfalls at the hillslope outlet for each rainfall event the rainfall intensity is 50 mm h and the rainfall duration is 60 min it is evident that the simulated runoff rates of the three rainfall events are fairly close to the measured values at different time while the simulated sediment yield rates versus time show different trends with the measured trends at small time the simulated sediment yield rate is a little larger than the measured value while at large time the simulated sediment yield rate tends to be a little smaller than the measured value this is because the present model does not consider the rill network evolution during the rainfall which tends to overestimate the rill flow erosivity and erosion at first and then underestimates them at last moreover note that the curves of runoff rate and sediment yield rate versus time follow a step function shape for rill pattern 1 which are rather different from those for rill patterns 2 and 3 this is possibly because the soil sealing occurs during the first rainfall event which can greatly modify the soil infiltration rate the runoff rate and the sediment yield rate previous studies only paid attention to the cumulative erosion and neglected the spatial distributions of hillslope runoff and soil erosion in reality the spatial distribution of soil erosion especially the rill erosion can provide a theoretical basis for formulating hillslope soil protection strategies thus the local rill erosion intensity defined here as the rill erosion per unit slope area along the slope length and quantified by measuring the topographic changes of rills is also used to verify the model note that the observed local rill erosion intensity is obtained every 1 0 m along the slope length while the simulated local rill erosion intensity is obtained for every 0 1 m along the slope length the local rill erosion intensity versus the slope length at the end of the three successive rainfalls is illustrated in fig 5 the results show that the simulated local rill erosion intensity for rill patterns 1 3 by the present model are all fairly close to the observed values and the root mean squared errors rmses are very small about 0 77 2 33 and 1 9 for rill patterns 1 3 respectively it indicates that the present model is able to simulate the spatial distribution of rill erosion accurately with changing rill characteristics the local rill erosion intensity does not vary monotonically with slope length and the maximum value does not occur at the hillslope outlet but in the middle of the lower half of the slope this is likely because the actual number of rills and rill flow erosivity vary significantly along the hillslope the number of rills near the outlet is greatly reduced and limited the local sediment transport capacity although the rill flow erosivity reaches its maximum value there similar results could also be found during rill development as shown in many field and laboratory experiments e g rejman and brodowski 2005 bruno et al 2008 schneider et al 2013 shen 2015 vinci et al 2015 zhang et al 2016 tian et al 2017 taking rill pattern 3 as an example fig 6 illustrates a map of simulated flow depth and cumulative soil erosion at t 60 min respectively it is evident that the concentrated overland flow is located in the rill regions and the difference between the maximum and minimum flow depths is close to 4 mm see fig 6a with the increase of flow length the rill flow depth first increases rapidly and then decreases near the hillslope outlet because of the discontinuous rills and the smaller rill depth comparatively the variation of interrill flow depth is very small it first increases monotonically with slope length at the upslope when the interrill runoff comes across a rill the interrill flow is delivered to the rill and the runoff depth of interrill flow decreases to near zero for the soil erosion the interrill areas suffer a low rate uniform erosion in the white areas shown in fig 6b this is because the interrill erosion is determined by the rainfall intensity and rainfall excess rate which do not show great spatial variability the intensive rill erosion area is located at the lower middle slope because of the high rill flow erosivity there in different rills the flow depth and erosion show great spatial variability even at the same slope length the flow depth and erosion are relatively larger for the hillslope with continuous and oblique rills because the interrill flow is easier to converge than the discontinuous and straight rills in addition note that the rill erosion does not change continuously in a small part of rill areas see fig 6b this is because the rill grids connect each other in x or y direction in the model simulation the slope gradient in y direction is steeper than in x direction and thus the rill grids connected in y direction suffers more severe erosion overall this example shows that the model is capable of reproducing the spatial and temporal variations of hydrological and erosion processes on hillslope surfaces with complex and changing rill network its capability allows the efforts of erosion modeling to be extended to irregularly rilled hillslopes and to provide detailed characteristics of hillslope runoff and soil erosion processes for developing reasonable soil conservation strategies 3 2 sensitive analysis a sensitivity analysis is carried out to determine how the variations of the rainfall soil runoff and erosion parameters e g p k 1 s θ 1 i n k i k r τ c and k t affect the interrill and rill erosion among these parameters k r τ c and k t are only related to rill erosion because the rainfall soil infiltration runoff interrill erosion and rill erosion parameters of present model are generally independent of each other the sensitivity analysis is performed by changing the value of one single parameter at a time and remaining the others constant as given in table 1 taking rill pattern 3 as an example the values of the cumulative interrill and rill erosion are compared with the reference values obtained using the set of calibrated parameters all the results are plotted in fig 7 for the interrill erosion the most sensitive parameters are p and ki the result exhibits a nearly power law increase in the cumulative interrill erosion with the increase in p which means the increase of interrill erosion becomes more prominent with increasing rainfall intensity for example an increase of 50 of p makes rise cumulative interrill erosion within the range of 76 1 126 9 this is because the increase of rainfall intensity also increases the rainfall excess rate which has dual effects on the interrill erosion rate as shown in eq 8 with an increasing of ki the cumulative interrill erosion increases linearly an increase of 50 of ki leads to an increase of cumulative interrill erosion of 50 comparatively the effects of k 1 s θ 1 i and n are not very sensitive a 50 variations of k 1 s θ 1 i and n only change the cumulative interrill erosion by less than 1 the main reason is that the soil infiltrability is much less than the rainfall intensity due to the soil sealing and thus the effects of variation of k 1 s θ 1 i and n on rainfall excess rate is not significant comparatively more parameters affect rill erosion k r is the most sensitive parameter tested and an increase of 100 of k r makes rise cumulative rill erosion of about 100 variation of rill erosion with k r is linear since the rill detachment rate is a linear function of k r as expressed in eq 9 τ c is a threshold value of shear stress under which no detachment by flow takes place decreasing τ c results in a slight increase in the cumulative rill erosion this is because although the decrease of τ c tends to increase the dr the flow sediment transport capacity tc restrains the increase of dr to a great extent comparatively with an increasing of τ c the cumulative rill erosion decreases drastically it can be deduced that τ c is a very sensitive parameter for rill erosion the impact of k t on rill erosion tends to become more prominent for smaller k t because it controls the transport capacity the sediment concentration parameter n is a factor accounting for surface roughness which is slightly less sensitive than that of k r when n rises the rill flow depth rises which leads to an increase in the shear stress and the rill flow erosivity it should be noted that the interrill erodibility factor can also affect the rill erosion with an increase of k i the rill erosion tends to decrease gradually this is because the soil generated from interrill area was transported through rills which tends to decrease the rill erosion rate as expressed in eq 9 the rill erosion is also very sensitive to rainfall intensity p an increase of 50 of p leads to an increase of 16 40 of rill erosion in contrast the soil infiltration parameters k 1 s and θ 1 i are not sensitive parameters and the major effects of the variation of k 1 s and θ 1 i are a decrease of rill erosion of less than 1 this is likely because the variation of soil infiltrability is much smaller than the rainfall intensity in this case in conclusion sensitive parameters for the cumulative interrill erosion are the rainfall intensity and interrill erodibility factor while the soil hydraulic conductivity initial soil water content and surface roughness have minor impacts on the interrill erosion for rill erosion sensitive parameters are rainfall intensity surface roughness soil critical shear stress and rill erodibility factor 3 3 effects of dendritic rill patterns and concave hillslope both the dendritic rills and concave hillslope are supposed to drastically affect the soil erosion processes e g michaelides et al 2010 gordon et al 2012 schneider et al 2013 bennett et al 2015 zhang et al 2016 oz et al 2017 qin et al 2017 tian et al 2017 to examine the hypotheses both the present model and wepp are applied to the four artificial rilled plots as shown in fig 8 note that wepp applied in the present study adopts the same infiltration runoff and soil erosion modeling theory as the present model the main difference is that wepp simulates the hillslope rainfall runoff and soil erosion processes in 1d and cannot reflect the impacts of the dendritic rills and concave hillslope it neglects the convergence processes of overland flow and assumes all rainfall excess generated from interrill areas is delivered into the rills immediately plot 1 includes a single parallel rill on a planar hillslope plot 2 shows a y shaped dendritic rill network on a planar hillslope plot 3 shows a single parallel rill on a concave hillslope and plot 4 shows a y shaped dendritic rill network on a concave hillslope considering the rainfall and soil characteristics are the same with the laboratory experiments the parameters of the present model are equal to these of rill pattern 3 see table 1 for wepp most parameters remain the same with the present model excepting the interrill and rill erodibility factors these two factors are calibrated again using the simulated results of plot 1 by the present model thus we can compare the simulated results between the present model and wepp to illustrate the impacts of dendritic rills and concave hillslope on soil erosion prediction fig 9 shows a map of simulated overland flow depth and cumulative soil erosion at t 60 min for the plot 1 very few rainfall excesses generated from interrill areas are delivered into the rill this is because the routing of overland flow to the parallel rill can be only from adjacent interrill areas the highest values of erosion intensity are located in the rill area where the concentrated overland flow occurs as seen in fig 9e with an increasing of slope length both the rill flow depth and rill erosion intensity tend to increase monotonically the maximum rill flow depth and erosion intensity are about 2 7 mm and 128 kg m2 respectively for the y shaped rills in plot 2 the excess rainfall and sediment generated from upstream interrill areas are delivered downslope into rills intercepting the interrill flow pathways and much more interrill flow and sediment can converge into the rills the maximum rill flow depth and erosion intensity increase to 5 8 mm and 370 kg m2 respectively comparatively for the plots 3 and 4 the concave hillslope surface can also benefit the interrill runoff and sediment concentrating into the rill from two lateral interrill areas the maximum rill flow depth and erosion intensity are almost the same for both plots 3 and 4 which are 8 2 mm and 614 kg m2 respectively this example suggests that the dendritic rills and concave hillslope can significantly contribute to the flow convergence and rill erosion which however cannot be addressed in previous models moreover the results show that the rill flow depth and rill erosion rate in the two side zones of plot 4 are slightly less than plot 2 this is because concave hillslopes can more quickly concentrate excess rainfall generated from interrill areas to the middle depression zone as shown in fig 9d which tends to decrease the rill flow depth and erosion intensity in the side zones to examine the differences between the present model and the wepp approach fig 10 shows the simulated cumulative interrill and rill erosion versus time for plots 1 4 by using both the present model and wepp because plots 1 4 have the same average ratio of rill spacing and rill width the interrill and rill erosion simulated by wepp do not change for plots 1 4 for interrill erosion it can be found that the simulated interrill erosion by the present model and wepp are almost the same for plots 1 and 2 comparatively there is a minor difference between the present model and wepp for plots 3 and 4 this is because the concave hillslope surface is more convenient for flow concentrated in the depression area and the rainfall excess rate is larger than that in the planar hillslope for rill erosion the cumulative rill erosion simulated by wepp is much smaller than that simulated by the present model for plots 2 4 and the differences tend to increase with rainfall duration for example the differences for plot 2 at t 20 40 and 60 min are 100 34 204 11 and 307 94 kg respectively which are quite close to those of plots 3 and 4 this is mainly because wepp assumed all the excess rainfall generated from the interrill areas are delivered to the rills directly the assumption of wepp will underestimate the calibrated erodibility factor and the rill erosion to a great extent moreover although the maximum rill erosion intensity occurs in the cases of plot 3 and 4 as shown in fig 9 the cumulative rill erosion of plot 2 is slightly larger than plots 3 and 4 it implies that either the dendritic rills or concave hillslope can drastically increase the rill erosion while their combined impacts make the cumulative rill erosion slightly less than the case of either the dendritic rills or concave hillslope this is because the impacts of concave hillslope are twofold on the one hand it can contribute to the flow convergence and increase the rill flow erosivity and erosion in the central depression zone on the other hand the concentrated overland flow of concave hillslope tends to decrease the rill flow depth and erosion in the two lateral zones of the hillslope thus for a concave hillslope with dentritic rills the concave hillslope tends to decrease the rill flow erosivity and rill erosion in two lateral zones of the hillslope see fig 9h overall because rill erosion always accounts for a large proportion of hillslope soil erosion it can be concluded that wepp cannot be equally accurate in predicting soil erosion with changing rill planform or hillslope shape by using the same set of model parameters 4 conclusions based on a two layer soil infiltration model a 2d diffusive wave overland flow model and wepp erosion modeling approaches a 2d physical model for infiltration overland flow and erosion at the plot scale is presented this distributed model can be applied to natural non planar hillslopes with changing rill networks the interrill and rill areas are distinguished prior to the simulation according to the topographic data which can address the spatially intricate partitioning of interrill and rill flow automatically and improve the rill hydraulics and erosion prediction the model is validated against laboratory observed rainfall runoff and soil erosion data for three different rill patterns and good agreements are found in runoff depth soil erosion and its spatial distribution for different rills on the hillslope the flow depth and erosion show great variability even at the same slope length the flow depth and erosion are much larger in continuous oblique rills because the interrill flow easily converges into the oblique rills and the rill flow cannot exit the continuous rills to return to the interrill areas the cumulative interrill erosion increases substantially with the rainfall intensity and interrill erodibility factor but varies slightly with the soil hydraulic conductivity initial soil water content and surface roughness for rill erosion the sensitive parameters are rainfall intensity surface roughness soil critical shear stress and rill erodibility factor the dendritic pattern of rills and concave hillslope shape can drastically affect the hillslope rainfall runoff and soil erosion processes both properties can contribute to the channelization of overland flow and increase the rill flow erosivity and erosion to a great extent the proposed model predicts the hillslope soil erosion in consistent accuracy for the changing rill network or hillslope shape by using the same set of model parameters which cannot be achieved with the wepp approach declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared

5981,there is a growing scientific consensus on climate change and its impact on catchment scale hydrologic and water quality processes therefore it is not only important to understand the impact of climate change but also necessary to formulate adaptation strategies to negate the effect of climate change to this end we have developed a hydrologic modeling framework soil and water assessment tool concomitant with analytical hierarchical process ahp to develop individual as well as composite climate vulnerability index in a southern new jersey watershed three agricultural bmps including cover crop filter strip and no till were examined to determine their ability to negate the climate change impact on water fluxes and water quality in the watershed downscaled projected temperature and precipitation from six general circulation models gcms for moderate and high emission scenarios rcp 4 5 and 8 5 respectively from the latest suite of coupled model intercomparison project phase 5 cmip5 were incorporated in to the hydrologic model overall results suggested an increase in temperature and precipitation under climate change scenarios leading to rise in surface runoff streamflow sediment and tp load relative to baseline scenario highly vulnerable areas to flooding sedimentation and eutrophication under climate change using ahp framework were standout from other types of vulnerable areas in the watershed due to presence of excess impervious surface higher percentage of agricultural lands and increased sediment and organic phosphorus respectively when agricultural bmps were implemented in corn and soybean fields located inside critical source areas csas under climate change scenarios bmps showed little to no effect towards reduction of water fluxes while they reduced maximum 2 and 12 of sediment and tp respectively compared to no bmp under climate change scenario further as the bmp were incorporated in all corn and soybean fields in the watershed the maximum sediment and tp reduction increased to 8 and 44 respectively the study outcomes suggests that climate change will increase the water fluxes as well as pollution load in the watershed however bmps can be used to negate the water quality impact due to climate change keywords climate change vulnerability index analytical hierarchical process adaptation strategies best management practices critical source areas 1 introduction the changing in global climate system is evident from increasing mean surface air temperature and precipitation pattern throughout the world ipcc 2014 ipcc 2007 in the united states u s the average annual temperature has increased by 0 7 c during 1986 to 2016 while the projected temperature shows an increase of 1 4 c during 2021 to 2050 vose et al 2017 likewise the mean annual precipitation in the u s has increased by nearly 4 during 1901 to 2015 and the frequency and intensity of extreme precipitation events are projected to increase in the future easterling et al 2017 warmer air due to increased atmospheric temperature holds more water vapor leading to intensification of hydrological cycles resulting into flooding drought and water quality degradation giri et al 2019 ahmadi et al 2014 leibowitz et al 2014 amplification of water quality degradation from nonpoint source pollution occurs due to increase in high pollution producing area known as critical source areas csas as a result of increased intensity and frequency of precipitation due to climate change the success of improving water quality from diffuse pollution sources such as agriculture lies on properly identify and target csas many researchers acknowledge the potential risk pose by climate change to flooding and water quality degradation for both human and natural systems vulnerability assessment due to climate change is prerequisite towards development of different adaptive management strategies to maintain a sustainable human and natural systems in the face of extreme climate events vulnerability is used in the context of risk assessment and defined as the propensity of a system to react adversely during exposure to hazardous events including external stress or events proag 2014 baker 2009 folke et al 2002 the primary objective of vulnerability study is to identify the vulnerable locations and prioritize allocation of adaptation funds to maintain a sustainable human and natural systems in the changing environment vulnerability is the evolving concept which encourages many definitions interpretations and conceptualization wirehn et al 2015 adger 2006 the most widely accepted method to assess vulnerability is the index based approach serafum et al 2019 blasiak et al 2017 debortoli et al 2017 geetha et al 2017 okpara et al 2017 nguyen et al 2017 woznicki et al 2016 wirehn et al 2015 balica 2012 jun et al 2011 baker 2009 index based approach based on multiple factors are preferred over single factor as multiple factors are able to capture different aspects of vulnerability in complex human and natural systems number of studies have developed vulnerability index which are primarily based on social context okpara et al 2017 blasiak et al 2017 nguyen et al 2017 baker 2009 few studies have conducted based on watershed basin approach woznicki et al 2016 jun et al 2011 however none of the studies have used multiple factors simultaneously using analytical hierarchical process ahp while calculating vulnerability index in the context of climate change that helps to maintain sustainability on watershed the degree of climate vulnerability on human and natural systems can be reduced to a great extent if not completely through proper climate adaptation strategies boonwichai et al 2019 babel et al 2011 therefore one of the overarching objectives of climate change study is to provide adaptation strategies to minimize the damage caused by climate change using the existing opportunities adaptation is often referred as adjustments to a system through changes in processes practices or structures in order to offset the potential damage caused by actual or expected agent alam et al 2012 ipcc 2001 as climate change is a global phenomenon there has been heightened interest among the scientists to elucidate the impact of climate change and provide adaptation strategies to cope with climate change in different regions climate change has the potential to alter the hydrology and water quality in the watershed leading to flooding sedimentation and eutrophication sunde et al 2018 neupane and kumar 2015 camici et al 2013 best management practices bmps are widely accepted methods to ameliorate water quality in agriculturally dominated watershed jeon et al 2018 her et al 2017 giri et al 2012 arabi et al 2008 and can be used as potential adaptation strategy to climate change however the performance of bmps may significantly vary under climate change as higher temperature due to climate change will alter the maturity pattern of the bmps for example cover crops including rye and wheat will flower and mature early under higher temperature due to climate change olesen et al 2012 rotter et al 2011 which will change their effectiveness in reducing diffuse pollutants in the watershed meanwhile increase in frequency and intensity of extreme precipitation under climate change may modify the surface runoff and erosion process resulting into alteration of bmp performance despite current advancement in understanding on bmp performance in reducing diffuse pollutants liu et al 2018 her et al 2017 giri et al 2015 giri et al 2014 bosch et al 2013 maringanti et al 2009 arabi et al 2008 still a significant knowledge gap exists on bmp performance under climate change as only few studies wagena and easton 2018 jeon et al 2018 wallace et al 2017 woznicki and nejadhashemi 2014 have looked at bmp performance under climate change consequently additional research on bmp performance under climate change is required to unfold the story of bmps as an effective adaptation strategy to ameliorate the adverse effect of climate change the climate change vulnerability assessment and adaptation strategies framework is developed and tested in the upper salem river watershed usrw the usrw is impaired due to excessive sediment total phosphorus and pathogen loading from nonpoint source pollutions primarily from agriculture njdep 2019 obropta and buckley 2006 the njdep has designated usrw as priority waterbody and a total maximum daily loads tmdls is established to improve the water quality in the watershed a series of bmps are being installed in order to fulfil the designated tmdls however the bmp implementation plan has not considered climate change factor the climate change assessment study of northeast in the united states including new jersey shows that the temperature has increased by approximately 1 1 c while the precipitation has increased by 13 cm between 1985 and 2011 horton et al 2014 meanwhile the extreme precipitation events in the northeast has increased by 70 percent since 1958 epa 2016 the projected climate change in the region suggests that the temperature will increase in the range of 1 1 5 5 c depending upon the level of emission while the average annual precipitation as well as frequency of extreme precipitation events are likely to increase in the future horton et al 2014 epa 2016 the rising temperature and increase in extreme precipitation events will likely to exacerbate the flooding as well as water quality issue in the northeast including in the usrw in this study we used change in i surface runoff ii sediment yield and iii phosphorus yield due to climate change as a way to assess vulnerability of climate change to natural and human systems where excess surface runoff represents potential to flooding increase sediment load leads to sedimentation and surge in phosphorus load results in eutrophication the vulnerability is assessed based on not only by individual factor but also through a multiple factors simultaneously including change in surface runoff sediment yield and phosphorus yield using ahp framework finally potential adaptation strategies to mitigate unintended consequences of climate change are provided through implementation of bmps the specific objectives of this study are to i determine the potential impact of climate change on hydrology and water quality in the watershed ii develop individual as well as composite climate change vulnerability index using ahp multi criteria decision making framework and iii provide a potential climate adaptation strategies to mitigate adverse climate change effects through three bmps including cover crop filter strip and no till 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the usrw is located in the northeast u s and in the context of new jersey it is situated in the southern portion of the state completely within salem county fig 1 the usrw consists of an approximately 36 km2 out of which 68 consists of agricultural land 12 wetlands 11 forest 8 urban and remainders are water and barren land usda nass 2019 agricultural land is the most dominant land use cover in the watershed where corn and soybean are predominant row crop followed by hay and pasture land it is a headwater to salem river and it flows from east to westward and finally drains into delaware river the maximum watershed elevation is 53 m above mean sea level while the minimum elevation is 8 m the highest elevation areas in the watershed are located primarily in the eastside while some higher elevation are also found in the edge of the southern portion of the watershed the lowest point is located in the western portion of the watershed where watershed outlet exists the watershed is located in the coastal plain physiographic province njgs 2006 and the primary soils are silt loam and sandy loam niazi et al 2015 2 2 climate change vulnerability assessment and adaptation strategies framework the climate change vulnerability assessment and adaptation strategies was developed and tested in the usrw which consists of five strands 1 baseline 2 climate change 3 climate change impact on watershed scale 4 climate change vulnerability index using ahp and 5 climate change adaptation strategies through bmps fig 2 2 2 1 baseline 2 2 1 1 hydrologic model in this study a physically based semi distributed watershed scale model known as soil and water assessment tool swat was used to simulate the streamflow surface runoff sediment load and phosphorus load in the usrw swat model was developed by the u s department of agriculture usda and it operates on a daily or sub daily time step to predict land management practices on hydrology and water quality in the river basin arnold et al 1998 gassman et al 2007 swat model divides the study watershed into subbasins based on the topography and further each subbasin is partitioned into hydrologic response unit hru which is a unique combination of land use soil slope and management simulation of watershed processes is driven by land phase hydrologic cycle followed by routing phase the primary components of swat model are hydrology erosion climate nutrients soil temperature plant growth land management practice and stream routing the detail of individual components as well as inner algorithms can be found from neitsch et al 2011 in this study swat model divides the usrw into 51 subbasins and 3191 hrus with thresholds of 1 10 10 for land use soil slope respectively these threshold values suggest that land use less than 1 within a subbasin were excluded while soil class less than 10 of each land use were eliminated and slope class having less than 10 were removed during hru formation 2 2 1 2 swat model input data swat model requires different input data including topography land use cover soil meteorological data streamflow data water quality data and management practices different data sources used for swat model setup along with description resolution and sources are provided in the table 1 topography data was used to delineate subbasins within the watershed while the crop data layer was used to represent the land use cover in the basin the soil survey geographic ssurgo database was used to provide physical and chemical properties of soil in the watershed the meteorology data consisted of daily precipitation and daily minimum and maximum daily temperature twenty six years 1990 2015 of daily precipitation and temperature data for two stations were used to simulate the climate in the watershed for this study the remaining weather data including relative humidity solar radiation and wind speed were auto simulated by swat weather generator the daily streamflow data for the watershed outlet for usgs gauging station 01482500 fig 1 was downloaded and converted to monthly basis for streamflow calibration and validation purpose the water quality data for the same usgs gauging station consisted of daily sediment and total phosphorus concentration which were converted to monthly load using the usgs load estimator loadest giri et al 2012 love and nejadhashemi 2011 runkel et al 2004 to accurately simulate the hydrology sediment and nutrient transport in the watershed different management practices including corn soybean soybean corn hay lawn management and pasture rotation were developed after series of interview with nrcs staffs local farmers landscape professional and residents inside the watershed the lawn management practices were incorporated only to the pervious part of the urban land use the management practices included tillage operations fertilization date and amount and planting and harvesting dates 2 2 1 3 model calibration validation and sensitivity analyses before model calibration the uncalibrated model was simulated for 15 years 2001 2015 to check the pattern of the simulated streamflow against the observed streamflow with default swat parameters next the calibration and validation was conducted using swat calibration and uncertainty procedure swat cup to handle large number of simulation with less time period abbaspour et al 2012 abbaspour et al 2007 the sequential uncertainty fitting sufi 2 optimization algorithm having objective function of nash sutcliff efficiency nse was used to capture the prediction accuracy in the model ten streamflow five sediment and seven total phosphorus tp calibration parameters were provided into swat cup based on the physiographic characteristics of the watershed as well as from a previous swat model calibration conducted in the same watershed by niazi et al 2015 global sensitivity analysis embedded along with sufi 2 algorithm was used for these parameters simultaneously along with calibration the model performance was evaluated using three metrics including nse percent bias pbias and root mean square error rmse observations standard ratio rsr the monthly simulated streamflow sediment and tp data from the swat model were compared against the respective observed data where the calibration period was from 2003 to 2009 and the validation period was 2010 2015 a two years of warm up period 2001 2002 was given in the model to initialize model parameters 2 2 2 climate change the climate change data in this study was used from seven climate projection general circulation models gcms including ccsm4 national center for atmospheric research csiro mk3 6 0 commonwealth scientific and industrial research organization queensland climate change centre of excellence gfdl esm2g noaa geophysical fluid dynamics laboratory ipsl cm5a lr institut pierre simon laplace miroc5 atmosphere and ocean research institute the university of tokyo and mpi esm lr max planck institute for meteorology earth system model from the latest suite of coupled model intercomparison project phase 5 cmip5 these gcms were selected for this study as these gcms were found to be suitable for north america giri et al 2019 wagena and easton 2018 culbertson et al 2016 cousino et al 2015 these data were downloaded from the united states bureau of reclamation usbr for moderate and high emission scenarios rcp 4 5 and rcp 8 5 respectively for two different time periods 1 1990 2015 and 2 2020 2045 the time period 1991 2015 represents as baseline condition while the time period 2021 2045 reflects the climate change in the future the climate data were downscaled using daily bias correction and constructed analogs bcca statistical downscaling technique to correct the systematic errors in gcms downscaled to a spatial resolution of 1 8 the bcca downscaling method consists of two steps 1 identify and eliminate the abnormal pattern in the projected dataset compared to the observed data using quantile mapping 2 reproject the gcm projection from original resolution to targeted resolution brekke et al 2013 the climate data from the gcms consisted of daily precipitation daily maximum and minimum air temperature while the remaining weather data such as solar radiation wind speed and relative humidity were generated by swat weather generator the total number of 28 scenarios including two different emissions rcp 4 5 and 8 5 along with two time periods baseline and climate change were employed in this study as the primary source of the uncertainty in climate change study originates from the gcms an ensemble mean approach of gcms recommended by most researchers was used in this study molina navarro et al 2018 arheimer and lindstorm 2015 furthermore a paired two sample t test was conducted between monthly observed streamflow data against the simulated average monthly streamflow data at watershed outlet for each gcm as well as for ensemble mean from 2003 to 2015 however out of six gcms the streamflow produced from ipsl cm5a lr gcm was significantly different than observed streamflow presented in the uncertainty analysis in the results section forced us to use the remaining five gcms to produce ensemble mean for this study all the results presented in this study are based on ensemble mean approach 2 2 3 climate change impact on watershed scale each gcm was run separately in the calibrated swat model and the impact of climate change on streamflow surface runoff sediment and tp were estimated on watershed scale using the following equation 1 c h a n g e i

2 2 4 climate change vulnerability index using analytical hierarchical process multi criteria decision analysis mcda is an effective method for watershed managers and policymakers which considers different factors simultaneously during assessment process in a complex environment the ahp is one of the mcda methods which has been applied in different fields including in engineering martinez martinez et al 2015 bottero et al 2011 economics sharma 2018 saaty 2010 industry rozman et al 2013 wang et al 2001 medicine liem et al 2018 morkunas et al 2018 social science morano et al 2016 escorcia et al 2014 and environmental management giri et al 2014 2016a b giri and nejadhashemi 2014 young et al 2009 the ahp was developed by saaty 1980 and the foundation of ahp lies on matrix formulation and manipulation the ahp consists of four step processes i construction of pairwise comparison matrix ii computation of priority vector iii calculation of consistency ratio iv ranking of alternatives in this study three factors were used to develop the climate change vulnerability index i change in surface runoff that represents potential to flooding ii change in sediment yield which reflects potential to sedimentation in the waterbodies and iii change in phosphorus yield that shows likelihood to eutrophication here we described the detail steps to generate the ranking among subbasins due to change in surface runoff and other two factors change in sediment and phosphorus yield were followed similarly to generate the ranking among subbasins 2 2 4 1 construction of pairwise comparison matrix step 1 the change in surface runoff for each subbasin was the difference of ensemble mean of climate change and baseline scenario the change in surface runoff was calculated for all 51 subbasins in the watershed and thereafter a pairwise comparison matrix was developed among 51 subbasins the final matrix 51 51 represented the criteria judgement matrix where the excess surface runoff of each subbasin was compared against all individual subbasins in the watershed and ranked against each other 2 2 4 2 computation of priority vector step 2 in this step relative vulnerability of each subbasin due to excess surface runoff was evaluated by calculating normalized principal eigenvector of the pairwise comparison matrix saaty 1980 the principal eigenvector was calculated by dividing each entry of the original pairwise comparison matrix generated in the previous step by the column sum of the respective entry the row sum of new matrix was estimated to generate the vulnerability weight of each subbasin due to excess surface runoff 2 2 4 3 calculate consistency ratio step 3 this step was to examine the validity of each entry of subbasin due to excess surface runoff against other subbasins provided during formulation of pairwise comparison matrix in step 1 calculation of consistency ratio was determined through the following steps 1 calculation of maximum eigenvalue 2 determination of consistency index and 3 estimation of consistency ratio first the pairwise comparison matrix developed in step 1 was multiplied with the vulnerability weight of each subbasin developed in step 2 to generate a new matrix further the new matrix was divided by vulnerability weight of each subbasin developed in step 2 to generate the final matrix the final matrix was averaged which produced the maximum eigenvalue the consistency index was calculated by using the following equation saaty 1980 2 consistency i n d e x m a x i m u m e i g e n v a l u e n n 1 where n number of rows or columns in the pairwise comparison matrix developed in step 1 finally the consistency ratio was calculated based on the following equation developed by saaty 1980 3 consistency r a t i o consistency i n d e x refractive i n d e x the refractive index for this study was 1 72 based on 51 rows or columns matrix developed in step 1 alonso and lamata 2006 if the consistency ratio was less than or equal to 0 1 then the pairwise comparison matrix formulated during step 1 was accepted or else the entries in the pairwise comparison matrix in step 1 were readjusted to ensure the validity of entries in the pairwise comparison matrix step 1 to step 3 were repeated separately for estimating vulnerability weight of each subbasin due to excess sediment and phosphorus yield due to climate change for rcp 4 5 and 8 5 scenarios 2 2 4 4 ranking of alternatives step 4 in this step the vulnerability weight of each subbasin due to excess surface runoff sediment yield and phosphorus yield were entered into a single matrix and this matrix was multiplied with three criteria priority vectors potential to flooding potential to sedimentation and potential to eutrophication having equal weight 0 33 to generate the composite vulnerability index due to climate change in the watershed in this way the composite vulnerability index was generated both for rcp 4 5 and 8 5 scenarios 2 2 5 climate adaptation strategies through bmps in this study three bmps including cover crop filter strip and no till were selected for climate change adaptation strategies in the usrw as these bmps were generally accepted by the local farmers these bmps were implemented in the row crops including corn and soybean for two scenarios i corn and soybean located within the csas and ii all corn and soybean fields in the watershed the csas in this study was identified based on pollution load produced per unit area method dong et al 2018 giri et al 2016a b giri et al 2012 tuppad and srinivasan 2008 the climate change scenario pre bmp application was compared with post bmp application of individual bmp to assess the climate adaptation strategies 2 2 5 1 cover crop cover crop is useful management practices in the agricultural field to reduce soil erosion as well as nutrient loss in the surface runoff by extracting nutrients and improving soil health usda nrcs 2011 a rye cover crop rotation was prepared for corn and soybean row crops by planting rye grass after harvest of row crops in october followed by killing of rye grass in the next year april before planting of row crop the primary objective of cover crop was to cover the ground during the absence of row crops 2 2 5 2 filter strip filter strip is a strip of dense permanent vegetation at the edge of the field which filters the sediment and nutrients in the runoff from the upland sources before entering into waterbodies the efficiency of filter strip in reducing pollutants depends on several factors and filter strip width is one of them in swat filter strip is modelled through filter width parameter to estimate sediment and nutrients trapping efficiency using the following equation mtibaa et al 2018 park et al 2011a b 4 trapping efficiency 0 367 filter width 0 2967 the filter strip width of 15 m was considered for this study based on the recommendation by niazi et al 2012 in the usrw 2 2 5 3 no till in no till soil is kept undisturbed after harvest of crop to planting of next crop leaving the residues on the field during planting minimum soil disturbance is preferred using a no till equipment rather than conventional method no till reduces sheet and rill erosion as well as accumulates soil organic matter which improves overall soil health no till was incorporated in the swat by removing the conventional tillage practices such as chisel plow from the original crop rotation and incorporating generic no till mixing increasing manning s roughness coefficient to 0 3 and reducing the curve number by two jeon et al 2018 almendinger and ulrich 2017 giri et al 2014 bosch et al 2013 3 results 3 1 model performance and uncertainty analysis the swat model performance for streamflow sediment and tp are presented in table 2 on monthly time step overall the model performance for streamflow was categorized as very good due to nse greater than 0 75 rsr less than 0 50 and pbias less than 10 moriasi et al 2007 based on these three model evaluation parameters streamflow was considered as good 0 65 nse 0 75 10 pbias 15 0 50 rsr 0 60 for calibration period while it was classified as very good for validation period the hydrograph generated after model calibration showed very good agreement between observed and simulated streamflow fig 3 however few peaks were underestimated by swat model which might be due to measurement error associated with precipitation and streamflow in the field as well as inability of swat model to capture the flashiness of the watershed nonetheless the overall model performance of very good category depicts that swat model can be used for climate change vulnerability and adaptation strategies study on watershed scale the overall model performance for sediment and tp was classified as good based on the guideline developed by moriasi et al 2007 the time series comparison plot between observed and simulated sediment and tp load during calibration and validation period is presented in figs s1 and s2 in the supplementary material these plots also depicted good agreement between observed and simulated data with some exception of few underestimated peaks there is a general consensus among researchers that the primary uncertainty in climate change study comes from the gcms molina navarro et al 2018 trolle et al 2015 jensen and veihe 2009 therefore gcms were compared visually fig 4 as well as using a paired two sample t test table 3 for rcp 8 5 emission scenario the visual comparison showed that the streamflow was highest during spring and lowest during summer while it showed an increasing trend during fall season this general trend was observed from individual gcms ensemble mean and observed streamflow compared to individual gcms ensemble mean showed better agreement with observed streamflow fig 4 which corroborated our analyses of using ensemble mean approach in this study the paired two sample t test depicted that all the streamflow from individual gcms except ipsl cm5a lr were statistically insignificant with observed streamflow at 5 level of confidence due to p value greater than 0 05 table 3 which forced us to eliminate ipsl cm5a lr during ensemble mean calculation during analyses in this climate change vulnerability and adaptation strategies study teutschbein and seibert 2012 also recommended to consider only good performance model in the current scenario over poor performance model during climate change study as a good performance model in the current scenario is more likely to perform better in the future rather than already a poor performing model in the current condition like rcp 8 5 a similar results were found among individual gcms compared to observed streamflow for rcp 4 5 emission scenario where individual gcms as well as ensemble mean were not significantly different than observed streamflow fig s3 and table s1 supplementary material 3 2 potential impacts of climate change on hydrology and water quality future temperature projection in both rcp scenarios showed a similar trend to baseline where maximum temperature was observed during july and minimum temperature was found in january table 4 overall the average monthly mean temperature increased from january to july in a linear fashion and decreased from july to january consistently however percent change in temperature indicated that a maximum 136 rise in temperature baseline 0 82 c to climate change 1 94 c was observed during january while a minimum increase in temperature baseline 22 70 c to climate change 23 40 c was noticed during june due to climate change in the rcp 4 5 emission scenario similarly maximum increase in temperature 130 was observed during january due to climate change however minimum surge in temperature was found in may instead of june in the rcp 8 5 emission scenario the average annual increase in temperature ranged from 7 37 to 8 44 for rcp 4 5 and 8 5 scenarios respectively due to climate change in both emission scenarios temperature increase was highest during winter compared to other seasons like temperature the future precipitation projection depicted a similar trend to baseline where maximum precipitation was displayed during august while minimum precipitation was demonstrated during february for both emission scenarios table 5 however percentage of change in precipitation analysis showed a different trend among two emission scenarios for example increase in precipitation was observed among all the months except october and november for rcp 4 5 emission scenario while increase in precipitation was noticed among all the months during rcp 8 5 emission scenario maximum 12 27 increase in precipitation baseline 102 34 mm to climate change 114 90 mm was observed during july and 14 72 in april baseline 91 11 to climate change 104 52 mm for rcp 4 5 and 8 5 emission scenarios respectively other noticeable fact among two emission scenarios was higher increase in precipitation during summer and early fall for rcp 4 5 scenario while it was during winter and early spring for rcp 8 5 scenario overall an annual increase in precipitation of 5 63 and 6 49 was observed due to climate change based on rcp 4 5 and 8 5 emission scenarios respectively due to projected increase in temperature and precipitation a change in water budget components were observed in the climate change scenarios compared to baseline in the usrw fig 5 all four water budget components evapotranspiration groundwater surface runoff and lateral flow displayed an increasing trend in the climate change scenarios out of all four components the gained in lateral flow due to climate change was least 3 mm for both rcp scenarios in contrast the highest gained more than 30 mm was observed for groundwater for both scenarios the second highest gained was found for evapotranspiration 20 mm followed by surface runoff the surface runoff increased from 154 mm baseline to 162 mm climate change for rcp 4 5 scenario while it rose from 151 mm baseline to 166 mm climate change based on rcp 8 5 scenario overall the quantity of water represented in water budget component in the usrw was in the decreasing order of evapotranspiration followed by groundwater surface runoff and lateral flow for both climate change and baseline scenarios projected increase in precipitation resulted into increased surface and subsurface runoff in this study increased temperature 7 34 with a concomitant increased precipitation 5 63 caused a surge of evapotranspiration 3 50 in the watershed while increased precipitation 5 63 caused a surge in groundwater 30 mm in our study under climate change due to projected increase in groundwater surface runoff and lateral flow the streamflow in the usrw was forecasted to increase in the climate change scenarios in fact 8 0 and 9 0 increased average annual streamflow was observed at the watershed outlet based on rcp 4 5 and 8 5 scenarios respectively fig 6 as expected due to increase in precipitation 5 0 and 10 rise in surface runoff was observed based on rcp 4 5 and 8 5 scenarios respectively fig 6 mean annual sediment was predicted to increase by 8 and 14 compared to baseline in the watershed based on rcp 4 5 and 8 5 scenarios respectively fig 6 the increase in sediment in the climate change scenarios was due to higher surface runoff coupled with higher intensity of precipitation during winter and early spring table 5 when agricultural fields were uncovered aforementioned reasons enhanced soil erosion and sediment yield in the hrus resulting into export of sediment from hrus to watershed outlet relative to baseline the mean annual tp was predicted to decrease by 1 8 and increase by 5 6 based on rcp 4 5 and 8 5 scenarios respectively fig 6 the detail breakdown analysis of tp showed an increasing trend of organic phosphorus while decreasing trend of mineral phosphorus in climate change scenarios compared to baseline fig 7 however the increment of organic phosphorus relative to baseline in rcp 8 5 scenario was much higher compared to rcp 4 5 scenario meanwhile the reduction of mineral phosphorus relative to baseline was lesser in rcp 8 5 scenario compared to rcp 4 5 the organic phosphorus in the stream consists of sediment phosphorus attached to soil particle and phosphorus present in biological materials including plants and animals their dead bodies and waste products greater surface runoff accompanied with higher intensity of precipitation during winter and early spring having less ground cover period resulted into approximately twice more sediment in rcp 8 5 scenario compared to rcp 4 5 fig 6 this resulted into higher organic phosphorous in rcp 8 5 scenario which altered the negative trend of tp to positive relative to baseline 3 3 development of individual as well as composite climate change vulnerability index individual climate change vulnerability index due to change in surface runoff change in sediment and phosphorus yield as well as composite vulnerability index was generated in the usrw using ahp framework the vulnerability index was categorized into three vulnerability classes including high medium and low categories for both rcp 4 5 and 8 5 scenarios figs 8 and 9 out of total 51 subbasins in the usrw 10 subbasins were classified as highly vulnerable to flooding due to increased surface runoff 17 subbasins were categorized as moderately vulnerable while remaining 24 subbasins were identified as least vulnerable based on rcp 4 5 scenario fig 8a the average percentage of subbasin area consisting of urban land for highly moderately and least vulnerable area to flooding was approximately 23 12 9 72 and 3 31 respectively increased precipitation due to climate change coupled with presence of higher urban land higher the impervious surface in the highly vulnerable areas increased the magnitude of surface runoff in the climate change scenario resulting into larger risk to flooding based on increase in sediment yield due to climate change 15 subbasins in the usrw were characterized as highly vulnerable to sedimentation 14 subbasins were classified as moderately vulnerable and 22 subbasins were categorized as least vulnerable based on rcp 4 5 scenario fig 8b land use cover lulc played a critical role between highly and moderately vulnerable areas versus least vulnerable areas in the watershed the average percentage of subbasin area contributing to agricultural land was approximately 73 for both highly and moderately vulnerable areas while it was nearly 57 for least vulnerable areas additionally average percentage of subbasin area contributing to forested land was roughly 9 for both highly and moderately vulnerable areas while it was nearly 12 8 for least vulnerable areas higher percentage of agricultural land coupled with lesser forested area differentiated between highly and moderately vulnerable area versus least vulnerable area when highly and moderately vulnerable areas were compared among each other same soil types were observed between two however higher slope in highly vulnerable areas played a primary role in categorizing areas between highly versus moderately vulnerable areas to sedimentation in the watershed based on change in tp yield under rcp 4 5 scenario usrw was divided into highly 8 subbasins moderately 10 subbasins and least vulnerable areas 33 subbasins fig 8c unlike change in surface runoff and sediment yield where all subbasins showed an increasing trend in the future climate change compared to baseline the tp yield in the usrw depicted both positive and negative yield during future climate change therefore the negative tp yield was designated as least vulnerable areas to eutrophication while the positive tp yield was further divided into highly and moderately vulnerable areas to eutrophication the negative trend of tp in some subbasins was due to reduction in soluble phosphorus under future climate change compared to baseline fig s4 supplementary material while the positive trend was due to combination of increased sediment and organic phosphorus in the future climate change compared to baseline fig s5 and s6 based on composite vulnerability index under rcp 4 5 scenario 9 subbasins 23 subbasins and remaining 19 subbasins were classified as highly vulnerable moderately vulnerable and least vulnerable areas respectively in the usrw fig 8d the highly moderately and least vulnerable areas based on increased in surface runoff increased in sediment yield and change in phosphorus yield as well as composite vulnerability under rcp 8 5 scenario is presented in fig 9 based on increased in surface runoff 15 subbasins 14 subbasins and 22 subbasins were classified as highly vulnerable moderately vulnerable and least vulnerable areas respectively in the usrw fig 9a compared to rcp 4 5 scenario the number of subbasins under highly vulnerable area increased under rcp 8 5 due to more intense precipitation under rcp 8 5 compared to rcp 4 5 fig 8a and 9a table 5 based on increased in sediment yield 9 subbasins were classified as highly vulnerable 25 subbasins were categorized as moderately vulnerable and remaining 17 subbasins were assigned as least vulnerable to sedimentation fig 9b relative to rcp 4 5 scenario more subbasins were classified as moderately vulnerable areas under rcp 8 5 and these additional subasins came from low vulnerability area under rcp 4 5 scenario to moderately vulnerable area under rcp 8 5 scenario due to greater sediment yield as a result of more surface runoff based on change in tp yield the usrw was divided into highly vulnerable area 12 subbasins moderately vulnerable area 32 subbasins and least vulnerable area 7 subbasins to eutrophication fig 9c compared to rcp 4 5 scenario lesser number of subbasins showed decrease in tp yield due to increase in sediment and organic phosphorus under rcp 8 5 scenario compared to rcp 4 5 scenario figs s5 and s6 supplementary material finally under composite vulnerability index 13 subbasins were classified as highly vulnerable areas 23 subbasins were categorized as moderately vulnerability areas and remaining 15 subbasins were assigned as least vulnerable areas fig 9d in the usrw 3 4 climate adaptation strategies through bmps 3 4 1 application of bmps in row crops inside csas the bmps were implemented only in the agricultural hrus of the csas of respective pollutants under rcp 4 5 and 8 5 scenarios the effectiveness of bmps on two primary water fluxes streamflow and surface runoff under future climate change scenarios are presented in the fig 10 none of the bmps were effective in reducing streamflow compared to no bmp application under both rcp 4 5 and 8 5 scenarios fig 10a and b this indicted that these bmps were not effective in reducing streamflow in the watershed scale another possible explanation of bmp ineffectiveness towards reducing streamflow may be the lesser bmp application area 10 and 12 9 of total watershed area under rcp 4 5 and 8 5 respectively for surface runoff all bmps except no till were ineffective in reducing surface runoff compared to no bmp under climate change scenario fig 10c and d no till bmp reduced approximately 2 2 and 2 9 of surface runoff under rcp 4 5 and 8 5 scenarios respectively compared to no bmp under climate change the undisturbed soil coupled with residue over the entire field increases the surface roughness in the field which may slowdown the surface runoff under climate change scenarios unlike water fluxes all bmps were effective in reducing pollutants sediment and tp compared to no bmp scenario under both climate change conditions on watershed scale fig 11 for sediment reduction all bmps showed consistency in reducing sediment under two emission scenarios fig 11a and b cover crop filter strip and no till reduced 1 1 1 8 and 1 8 sediment load respectively compared to no bmp scenario under rcp 4 5 scenario while they reduced 1 3 1 8 and 1 8 sediment load respectively under rcp 8 5 scenario the bmp application area were 9 5 and 10 7 of total watershed area under rcp 4 5 and 8 5 scenarios respectively like sediment all bmps were also effective in reducing tp under both climate change scenarios fig 11c and d cover crop filter strip and no till decreased tp in the watershed by 2 8 9 and 0 2 respectively compared to no bmp application under rcp 4 5 scenario while the reduction efficiency of these bmps increased to 4 1 12 2 and 0 6 respectively under rcp 8 5 scenario in the usrw the increased in tp reduction efficiency by these bmps in rcp 8 5 scenario compared to rcp 4 5 was due to increase in bmp application area from 6 9 rcp 4 5 scenario to 10 8 rcp 8 5 scenario when tp effectiveness of bmps were compared among these three bmps the highest reduction was found in filter strip followed by cover crop and no till 3 4 2 application of bmps in all row crops corn and soybean in this scenario bmps were implemented in all the corn and soybean fields 46 of total watershed area one at a time to evaluate the effectiveness of bmps to negate climate change impact at watershed scale although the bmp application area was increased to 46 of total watershed area a similar insignificant effect of bmps were noticed to reduce streamflow under both climate change scenarios fig 12 a and b in case of surface runoff similar results were found among the bmps as observed in section 3 4 1 when bmp effectiveness was compared among the bmps none of the bmps except no till were effective in reducing surface runoff under climate change scenarios fig 12 c and d no till reduced 9 5 to 10 of surface runoff as opposed to 2 to 3 section 3 4 1 under climate change scenarios compared to no bmp scenario this demonstrates that increase in bmp application area increased the efficiency of surface runoff reduction by no till under climate change when bmp effectiveness in reducing sediment was compared among the bmps no till was most effective followed by cover crop and filter strip fig 13 a and b in fact cover crop filter strip and no till reduced 2 3 2 and 5 sediment load at watershed outlet respectively under climate change scenario compared to no bmp application when bmp effectiveness was compared to section 3 4 1 bmp application area had slight impact in increasing sediment reduction efficiency at watershed outlet however a detail sediment reduction analysis in the subbasins by these bmps showed a 15 to 30 sediment load reduction figs s7 and s8 this higher percentage of sediment load reduction by these bmps at subbasins level did not translate into watershed outlet which may be due to higher sediment generation due stream bed downcutting and stream bank erosion during routing phase in the river channel the effectiveness of bmps except no till in reducing tp is clearly visible from the fig 13 c and d for both climate change scenarios the reduction of tp at watershed outlet ranged from 1 to 44 among the bmps the highest percentage of tp reduction 44 was observed in filter strip followed by cover crop 13 14 and no till 1 when tp reduction was compared with section 3 4 1 increase in tp reduction was noticed with rise in bmp application area for filter strip and cover crop for cover crop the tp reduction increased form 4 to 14 while it elevated from 12 to 44 for filter strip however insignificant increase in tp reduction was observed for no till 4 discussion this study permits a more nuanced investigation of climate change vulnerability assessment using ahp framework as well as testing bmps as climate adaptation strategies to negate climate change effect results demonstrates that approximately 1 c average annual rise in temperature in the watershed for both climate change scenarios meanwhile temporal analysis shows a sharp rise in temperature during winter season the projected precipitation depicts nearly 5 5 annual increase in precipitation for both climate change scenarios however the precipitation in rcp 8 5 scenario appears to be more pronounced than the precipitation in rcp 4 5 and more precipitation are expected when agricultural fields are less covered winter and early spring our findings on projected temperature and precipitation under climate change are consistent with other researchers for example the climate change study of verma et al 2015 demonstrates an increase of 4 3 c temperature and 5 6 precipitation relative to baseline in the great lakes watersheds furthermore eum et al 2017 indicates 3 3 c rise of temperature and 7 10 increase in precipitation in a climate change study in the athabasca river basin alberta canada the increase in temperature coupled with higher intense precipitation during winter and early spring will alter the hydrologic cycles nutrient cycle and sediment transport in the watershed our findings on water budget component trends evapotranspiration groundwater surface runoff and lateral flow in our study echo with the findings of other researchers projected increase in precipitation resulted into increased surface and subsurface runoff in this study which is consistent with shrestha et al 2017 as well as wagena and easton 2018 in a canadian watershed and chesapeake bay watershed in u s respectively furthermore increased air temperature in the climate change scenarios increases soil temperature which increases soil hydraulic conductivity facilitating more infiltration and ultimately higher subsurface runoff components groundwater and lateral flow in the climate change scenario this outcome is consistent with the results of giri et al 2019 in climate change study on different water fluxes in the neshanic river watershed in new jersey usa increasing evaporation trend in climate change scenarios is corroborated by the outcomes of ficklin et al 2009 they also demonstrated an increase of 2 8 evapotranspiration with a surge of 6 4 c temperature while keeping the precipitation constant with baseline in a climate change irrigation water demand study in a central california watershed rise in groundwater in climate change scenarios is unequivocally supported by the outcomes of park et al 2011a b who demonstrated 34 mm increased groundwater in the chungju dam watershed in south korea with an increase in 12 9 precipitation accompanied by surge in 1 9 c temperature in a climate change study projected increased streamflow with a concomitant increased surface runoff displays a potential to worsen flooding scenario in the watershed specially during spring season higher intensity of precipitation during winter and early spring more specifically under rcp 8 5 scenario will likely to increase the peak flow in the watershed resulting into flooding byun et al 2019 also predicted greater flood risks in most of the watersheds located in the midwest and great lakes region due to greater increase in precipitation during winter and spring season the findings of streamflow surface runoff sediment and tp in different watersheds around the globe under climate change scenario are presented in table 6 our finding of streamflow 8 9 increase is consistent with verma et al 2015 who predicted 9 7 increase in streamflow in the maumee river watershed in ohio u s with 5 6 rise in average annual precipitation coupled with 4 3 c increased temperature additionally bosch et al 2014 forecasted an average 12 rise in streamflow from four mid western watersheds located in ohio and michigan region under 6 rise in average annual precipitation accompanied with 5 0 c increased temperature similarly rising surface runoff trend 5 10 in our study is echoed by many researchers marcinkowski et al 2017 observed an approximately 7 increase in average annual surface runoff in the upper narew catchment in poland due to climate change combination of 2 0 c rise in temperature and 9 5 increase in precipitation furthermore wagena and easton 2018 found 5 increase in average annual surface runoff due to 6 5 increase in annual precipitation coupled with 2 2 c rise in temperature in the chesapeake bay watershed in north east u s increasing trends in sediment loads 8 14 are consistent with the results of other studies nilawar and waikar 2019 also predicted 8 5 increase in sediment in the purna river watershed in india due to 7 7 rise in precipitation combined with 1 0 c increase in temperature in a climate change study additionally khoi and thang 2017 reported 12 8 increased sediment in the climate change scenario which consisted of 1 7 increase in annual precipitation coupled with 0 9 c rise in temperature in the 3s river basin in cambodia vietnam region trends of tp 1 8 to 5 6 in our study is corroborated by the outcomes of other studies including park et al 2011a b and bosch et al 2014 park et al 2011a b also forecasted 4 1 decrease and 19 6 increase in tp due to 3 4 and 27 3 increase in sediment relative to baseline in a climate change study in chungju dam watershed in south korea additionally bosch et al 2014 predicted a decrease and increase in average annual tp yield by 0 5 and 7 8 in maumee river watershed ohio under moderate and pronounced climate change condition respectively increased surface runoff exports more sediment and tp from landscapes resulting into increase of csas in the watershed the increase in csas in the watershed will generate excess amount of new pollutants which will export into the rivers and streams in the watershed leading to further exacerbating the water quality renkenberger et al 2017 also reported increasing pattern of sediment tn and tp csas leading to export of more pollutants relative to baseline condition in the greensboro river watershed located in maryland under future climate change this increasing pollution generating phenomena under future climate creates more pressure on regulatory agencies including new jersey department of environmental protection to restore the already degraded water in the usrw without any innovative strategy it is not only impossible to achieve the water quality goal but also difficult to maintain the status quo of current loading under climate change the vulnerability assessment using ahp framework in the usrw represents a holistic approach to nullify the climate change effect for policymakers and practitioners depending on the priority under resource constraint policymakers could focus on the vulnerable areas in the watershed for example if flooding is priority then they should provide emphasis on flood vulnerable areas in the watershed however it is recommended to give importance to high vulnerable areas identified under composite vulnerability index scenario to counter the effect of climate change and maintain sustainability in the environment this innovative way of application of ahp permits us to formulate an effective decision support system by identifying highly vulnerable areas in the watershed from multi factors prospective simultaneously flooding sedimentation and eutrophication substantial increase in impervious surface in highly flood vulnerable area differentiated from moderately and least vulnerable area in the watershed under climate change this finding is consistent with zhou et al 2019 who concluded that urbanization particularly increased impervious surface under climate change is one of the primary drivers that impacts on surface runoff followed by increasing the flooding risks in the watershed sediment vulnerable areas were stand out due to higher agricultural land coupled with higher slope compared to other areas in the watershed this finding is echoed with the outcomes of other researchers around the globe including giri et al 2019 shrestha and wang 2018 white et al 2009 and tripathi et al 2003 testing three common agricultural bmps in the usrw displays a potential avenue to offset the effect of climate change on sediment and tp load in the stream however these bmps showed no effect on reducing streamflow even after increasing bmp application area to 46 of total watershed other researchers also found similar results wagena and easton 2018 noticed that filter strip and no till had little to no effect in reducing streamflow under climate change in the susquehanna river watershed chesapeake bay where the bmp application area was 30 furthermore bosch et al 2014 observed that combination of agricultural bmps including no till cover crops and filter strip only at 100 implementation level were able to offset the streamflow discharge due to climate change in the maumee river watershed in ohio only no till reduced surface runoff to some extent 2 to 3 or 9 5 to 10 depending upon the bmp application area however it did not create an overall impact on streamflow her et al 2017 found that no till bmp was able to reduce approximately 9 surface runoff under current climate condition in the st joseph river watershed midwest u s furthermore wallace et al 2017 determined that applying no till to all crop lands in a midwestern watershed reduced 22 25 surface runoff under climate change scenario one of the possible explanation for ineffectiveness of bmps in reducing water fluxes streamflow and surface runoff is that these three bmps cover crop filter strip and no till are generally applied to control sediment and nutrients rather than streamflow consequently other bmps which are designed more towards controlling surface runoff could be tested in the watershed to control the surface runoff and ultimately to streamflow in contrast these bmps demonstrates effectiveness in reducing sediment and tp relative to no bmp scenario under climate change which is a positive sign for policymakers and watershed mangers to plan alternative strategies to maintain the water quality in the river and streams under climate change our hypothesis of rise in bmp application area increases pollution reduction proved to be correct in case of sediment and tp reduction under climate change scenarios however bmps were lesser effective 2 5 in reducing sediment based on watershed outlet as compared to sediment reduction in the fields 15 30 sediment reduction at watershed outlet is the combination of sediment reduction at fields plus increasing decreasing of sediment load during routing phase through river channel therefore we believe that erosion in stream bank and stream bed due to increased streamflow under climate change offsetting the actual sediment reduction efficiency by bmps at watershed outlet qiu and wang 2014 also pointed out the major source of sediment in a new jersey watershed was the stream itself where the stream contributed approximately 60 of the total sediment load due to erosion in the stream bank coupled with resurface of deposited sediment in the streambed during high streamflow furthermore our outcome is corroborated by another study conducted by giri et al 2019 in neshanic river watershed in new jersey where they observed increased sediment load at the watershed outlet after considering channel routing under climate change scenarios in contrast to sediment reduction by bmps at watershed outlet tp reduction by bmps with increasing bmp application area increased significantly except no till insignificant reduction of tp by no till is due to the fact that no till reduces the phosphorus associated with sediment while it facilitates dissolve phosphorus readily available at soil surface her et al 2017 giri et al 2012 bundy et al 2001 therefore the overall reduction of tp by no till is minimal in contrast maximum tp 44 was reduced by filter strip which is a good sign to reduce negative impact of climate change maximum reduction of tp by filter strip is due to removal of sediment bound phosphorus through deposition as well as extraction of soluble phosphorus al wadaey et al 2012 other researchers also found a similar results of bmps effectiveness in reducing sediment and tp under climate change bosch et al 2014 observed that combination of three bmps cover crop filter strip and no till in approximately 20 of the watershed area having row crop reduced 10 of sediment yield in the maumee river watershed in ohio under moderate climate change condition higher sediment reduction in their study compared to ours was due to lesser erosive channel compared to more erosive channel in our study area coupled with combination of three bmps simultaneously wagena and easton 2018 observed that filter strip and no till reduced the export of tp by 14 2 to 16 4 and 3 4 to 5 4 respectively compared to no bmp scenario under climate change in a chesapeake bay watershed lesser bmp efficiency in reducing tp for filter strip under climate change in their study was due to lesser bmp application area compared to our study increasing bmp application area under climate change also increased the amount of pollution reduction which is confirmed from our analysis sections 3 4 1 and 3 4 2 consequently based on the requirement of pollution reduction under climate change the bmp application area can be increased to fulfill the steep pollution reduction goal additionally combination bmps could be tested in the future to support pollution reduction goal due to more pronounced climate change in this paragraph we highlight the following major and unique contributions from this study i fate and transport of tp under climate change scenarios ii identifying individual as well as composite climate vulnerability index to flooding sedimentation and eutrophication due to climate change using ahp framework iii reduction of sediment loads by bmps was less distinct compared to their tp reduction capacity and iv no till was more effective in reducing sediment while it had little to no impact on tp reduction under climate change relative to baseline tp load at the watershed outlet found to be decreasing and increasing trend for rcp 4 5 and 8 5 scenarios respectively a further detail analysis showed an increasing trend of organic phosphorus compared to baseline in rcp 8 5 is greater than rcp 4 5 while the reduction of mineral phosphorus compared to baseline in rcp 8 5 is lesser than rcp 4 5 greater surface runoff concomitant with higher intensity of precipitation increased the sediment load twice in rcp 8 5 scenario compared to rcp 4 5 which attributed to higher organic phosphorus load in rcp 8 5 scenario compared to rcp 4 5 the reduction trend of mineral phosphorus in both rcp scenarios could be the effect of elevated co2 under climate change which could extract more soluble phosphorus by the plants leaving lesser soluble phosphorus available for surface runoff introduction of ahp framework to identify composite as well as individual climate vulnerability index to flooding sedimentation and eutrophication is the unique contribution from this study which will help watershed managers and policymakers to target the subject of their interest based on science based information to design a climate adaptation strategies the lesser effectiveness of bmps to control sediment load at watershed outlet was may be due to more sediment generation as a result of stream bed downcutting and streambank erosion during stream routing phase as these bmps demonstrated 15 30 sediment reduction efficiency on the overland finally no till bmp had little to no impact on tp reduction while it was effective in sediment reduction the aforementioned trend was may be due to fact that no till reduces the phosphorus associated with sediment while it facilitates dissolve phosphorus readily available at soil surface 5 conclusions this study assessed the climate change vulnerability using an innovative ahp framework as well as tested three agricultural bmps as adaptation strategies to compensate the climate change effect in a southern new jersey watershed results indicated that rise in temperature and precipitation will increase water fluxes surface runoff and streamflow and deteriorate water quality increase sediment and tp load in the watershed higher intensity of precipitation was observed during winter and early spring while higher temperature was noticed during winter the amount of reduction of mineral phosphorus relative to baseline in the climate change scenarios played vital role on overall increasing decreasing trend of tp the ahp framework permitted us to develop a composite vulnerability index considering excess surface runoff sediment and tp yield due to climate change which presented potential to flooding sedimentation and eutrophication respectively agricultural bmps were effective in reducing water quality due to climate change however they had little to no impact on streamflow and surface runoff in order to control water fluxes due to climate change following items could be tested in the future i other bmps could be examined in the watershed ii as well as combination of bmps identified highly vulnerability areas based on composite vulnerability index should be targeted by watershed managers and policymakers to negate the climate change consequences in the watershed the approach developed in this study can be applied to other regions in the world and it will provide science based information

5981,there is a growing scientific consensus on climate change and its impact on catchment scale hydrologic and water quality processes therefore it is not only important to understand the impact of climate change but also necessary to formulate adaptation strategies to negate the effect of climate change to this end we have developed a hydrologic modeling framework soil and water assessment tool concomitant with analytical hierarchical process ahp to develop individual as well as composite climate vulnerability index in a southern new jersey watershed three agricultural bmps including cover crop filter strip and no till were examined to determine their ability to negate the climate change impact on water fluxes and water quality in the watershed downscaled projected temperature and precipitation from six general circulation models gcms for moderate and high emission scenarios rcp 4 5 and 8 5 respectively from the latest suite of coupled model intercomparison project phase 5 cmip5 were incorporated in to the hydrologic model overall results suggested an increase in temperature and precipitation under climate change scenarios leading to rise in surface runoff streamflow sediment and tp load relative to baseline scenario highly vulnerable areas to flooding sedimentation and eutrophication under climate change using ahp framework were standout from other types of vulnerable areas in the watershed due to presence of excess impervious surface higher percentage of agricultural lands and increased sediment and organic phosphorus respectively when agricultural bmps were implemented in corn and soybean fields located inside critical source areas csas under climate change scenarios bmps showed little to no effect towards reduction of water fluxes while they reduced maximum 2 and 12 of sediment and tp respectively compared to no bmp under climate change scenario further as the bmp were incorporated in all corn and soybean fields in the watershed the maximum sediment and tp reduction increased to 8 and 44 respectively the study outcomes suggests that climate change will increase the water fluxes as well as pollution load in the watershed however bmps can be used to negate the water quality impact due to climate change keywords climate change vulnerability index analytical hierarchical process adaptation strategies best management practices critical source areas 1 introduction the changing in global climate system is evident from increasing mean surface air temperature and precipitation pattern throughout the world ipcc 2014 ipcc 2007 in the united states u s the average annual temperature has increased by 0 7 c during 1986 to 2016 while the projected temperature shows an increase of 1 4 c during 2021 to 2050 vose et al 2017 likewise the mean annual precipitation in the u s has increased by nearly 4 during 1901 to 2015 and the frequency and intensity of extreme precipitation events are projected to increase in the future easterling et al 2017 warmer air due to increased atmospheric temperature holds more water vapor leading to intensification of hydrological cycles resulting into flooding drought and water quality degradation giri et al 2019 ahmadi et al 2014 leibowitz et al 2014 amplification of water quality degradation from nonpoint source pollution occurs due to increase in high pollution producing area known as critical source areas csas as a result of increased intensity and frequency of precipitation due to climate change the success of improving water quality from diffuse pollution sources such as agriculture lies on properly identify and target csas many researchers acknowledge the potential risk pose by climate change to flooding and water quality degradation for both human and natural systems vulnerability assessment due to climate change is prerequisite towards development of different adaptive management strategies to maintain a sustainable human and natural systems in the face of extreme climate events vulnerability is used in the context of risk assessment and defined as the propensity of a system to react adversely during exposure to hazardous events including external stress or events proag 2014 baker 2009 folke et al 2002 the primary objective of vulnerability study is to identify the vulnerable locations and prioritize allocation of adaptation funds to maintain a sustainable human and natural systems in the changing environment vulnerability is the evolving concept which encourages many definitions interpretations and conceptualization wirehn et al 2015 adger 2006 the most widely accepted method to assess vulnerability is the index based approach serafum et al 2019 blasiak et al 2017 debortoli et al 2017 geetha et al 2017 okpara et al 2017 nguyen et al 2017 woznicki et al 2016 wirehn et al 2015 balica 2012 jun et al 2011 baker 2009 index based approach based on multiple factors are preferred over single factor as multiple factors are able to capture different aspects of vulnerability in complex human and natural systems number of studies have developed vulnerability index which are primarily based on social context okpara et al 2017 blasiak et al 2017 nguyen et al 2017 baker 2009 few studies have conducted based on watershed basin approach woznicki et al 2016 jun et al 2011 however none of the studies have used multiple factors simultaneously using analytical hierarchical process ahp while calculating vulnerability index in the context of climate change that helps to maintain sustainability on watershed the degree of climate vulnerability on human and natural systems can be reduced to a great extent if not completely through proper climate adaptation strategies boonwichai et al 2019 babel et al 2011 therefore one of the overarching objectives of climate change study is to provide adaptation strategies to minimize the damage caused by climate change using the existing opportunities adaptation is often referred as adjustments to a system through changes in processes practices or structures in order to offset the potential damage caused by actual or expected agent alam et al 2012 ipcc 2001 as climate change is a global phenomenon there has been heightened interest among the scientists to elucidate the impact of climate change and provide adaptation strategies to cope with climate change in different regions climate change has the potential to alter the hydrology and water quality in the watershed leading to flooding sedimentation and eutrophication sunde et al 2018 neupane and kumar 2015 camici et al 2013 best management practices bmps are widely accepted methods to ameliorate water quality in agriculturally dominated watershed jeon et al 2018 her et al 2017 giri et al 2012 arabi et al 2008 and can be used as potential adaptation strategy to climate change however the performance of bmps may significantly vary under climate change as higher temperature due to climate change will alter the maturity pattern of the bmps for example cover crops including rye and wheat will flower and mature early under higher temperature due to climate change olesen et al 2012 rotter et al 2011 which will change their effectiveness in reducing diffuse pollutants in the watershed meanwhile increase in frequency and intensity of extreme precipitation under climate change may modify the surface runoff and erosion process resulting into alteration of bmp performance despite current advancement in understanding on bmp performance in reducing diffuse pollutants liu et al 2018 her et al 2017 giri et al 2015 giri et al 2014 bosch et al 2013 maringanti et al 2009 arabi et al 2008 still a significant knowledge gap exists on bmp performance under climate change as only few studies wagena and easton 2018 jeon et al 2018 wallace et al 2017 woznicki and nejadhashemi 2014 have looked at bmp performance under climate change consequently additional research on bmp performance under climate change is required to unfold the story of bmps as an effective adaptation strategy to ameliorate the adverse effect of climate change the climate change vulnerability assessment and adaptation strategies framework is developed and tested in the upper salem river watershed usrw the usrw is impaired due to excessive sediment total phosphorus and pathogen loading from nonpoint source pollutions primarily from agriculture njdep 2019 obropta and buckley 2006 the njdep has designated usrw as priority waterbody and a total maximum daily loads tmdls is established to improve the water quality in the watershed a series of bmps are being installed in order to fulfil the designated tmdls however the bmp implementation plan has not considered climate change factor the climate change assessment study of northeast in the united states including new jersey shows that the temperature has increased by approximately 1 1 c while the precipitation has increased by 13 cm between 1985 and 2011 horton et al 2014 meanwhile the extreme precipitation events in the northeast has increased by 70 percent since 1958 epa 2016 the projected climate change in the region suggests that the temperature will increase in the range of 1 1 5 5 c depending upon the level of emission while the average annual precipitation as well as frequency of extreme precipitation events are likely to increase in the future horton et al 2014 epa 2016 the rising temperature and increase in extreme precipitation events will likely to exacerbate the flooding as well as water quality issue in the northeast including in the usrw in this study we used change in i surface runoff ii sediment yield and iii phosphorus yield due to climate change as a way to assess vulnerability of climate change to natural and human systems where excess surface runoff represents potential to flooding increase sediment load leads to sedimentation and surge in phosphorus load results in eutrophication the vulnerability is assessed based on not only by individual factor but also through a multiple factors simultaneously including change in surface runoff sediment yield and phosphorus yield using ahp framework finally potential adaptation strategies to mitigate unintended consequences of climate change are provided through implementation of bmps the specific objectives of this study are to i determine the potential impact of climate change on hydrology and water quality in the watershed ii develop individual as well as composite climate change vulnerability index using ahp multi criteria decision making framework and iii provide a potential climate adaptation strategies to mitigate adverse climate change effects through three bmps including cover crop filter strip and no till 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the usrw is located in the northeast u s and in the context of new jersey it is situated in the southern portion of the state completely within salem county fig 1 the usrw consists of an approximately 36 km2 out of which 68 consists of agricultural land 12 wetlands 11 forest 8 urban and remainders are water and barren land usda nass 2019 agricultural land is the most dominant land use cover in the watershed where corn and soybean are predominant row crop followed by hay and pasture land it is a headwater to salem river and it flows from east to westward and finally drains into delaware river the maximum watershed elevation is 53 m above mean sea level while the minimum elevation is 8 m the highest elevation areas in the watershed are located primarily in the eastside while some higher elevation are also found in the edge of the southern portion of the watershed the lowest point is located in the western portion of the watershed where watershed outlet exists the watershed is located in the coastal plain physiographic province njgs 2006 and the primary soils are silt loam and sandy loam niazi et al 2015 2 2 climate change vulnerability assessment and adaptation strategies framework the climate change vulnerability assessment and adaptation strategies was developed and tested in the usrw which consists of five strands 1 baseline 2 climate change 3 climate change impact on watershed scale 4 climate change vulnerability index using ahp and 5 climate change adaptation strategies through bmps fig 2 2 2 1 baseline 2 2 1 1 hydrologic model in this study a physically based semi distributed watershed scale model known as soil and water assessment tool swat was used to simulate the streamflow surface runoff sediment load and phosphorus load in the usrw swat model was developed by the u s department of agriculture usda and it operates on a daily or sub daily time step to predict land management practices on hydrology and water quality in the river basin arnold et al 1998 gassman et al 2007 swat model divides the study watershed into subbasins based on the topography and further each subbasin is partitioned into hydrologic response unit hru which is a unique combination of land use soil slope and management simulation of watershed processes is driven by land phase hydrologic cycle followed by routing phase the primary components of swat model are hydrology erosion climate nutrients soil temperature plant growth land management practice and stream routing the detail of individual components as well as inner algorithms can be found from neitsch et al 2011 in this study swat model divides the usrw into 51 subbasins and 3191 hrus with thresholds of 1 10 10 for land use soil slope respectively these threshold values suggest that land use less than 1 within a subbasin were excluded while soil class less than 10 of each land use were eliminated and slope class having less than 10 were removed during hru formation 2 2 1 2 swat model input data swat model requires different input data including topography land use cover soil meteorological data streamflow data water quality data and management practices different data sources used for swat model setup along with description resolution and sources are provided in the table 1 topography data was used to delineate subbasins within the watershed while the crop data layer was used to represent the land use cover in the basin the soil survey geographic ssurgo database was used to provide physical and chemical properties of soil in the watershed the meteorology data consisted of daily precipitation and daily minimum and maximum daily temperature twenty six years 1990 2015 of daily precipitation and temperature data for two stations were used to simulate the climate in the watershed for this study the remaining weather data including relative humidity solar radiation and wind speed were auto simulated by swat weather generator the daily streamflow data for the watershed outlet for usgs gauging station 01482500 fig 1 was downloaded and converted to monthly basis for streamflow calibration and validation purpose the water quality data for the same usgs gauging station consisted of daily sediment and total phosphorus concentration which were converted to monthly load using the usgs load estimator loadest giri et al 2012 love and nejadhashemi 2011 runkel et al 2004 to accurately simulate the hydrology sediment and nutrient transport in the watershed different management practices including corn soybean soybean corn hay lawn management and pasture rotation were developed after series of interview with nrcs staffs local farmers landscape professional and residents inside the watershed the lawn management practices were incorporated only to the pervious part of the urban land use the management practices included tillage operations fertilization date and amount and planting and harvesting dates 2 2 1 3 model calibration validation and sensitivity analyses before model calibration the uncalibrated model was simulated for 15 years 2001 2015 to check the pattern of the simulated streamflow against the observed streamflow with default swat parameters next the calibration and validation was conducted using swat calibration and uncertainty procedure swat cup to handle large number of simulation with less time period abbaspour et al 2012 abbaspour et al 2007 the sequential uncertainty fitting sufi 2 optimization algorithm having objective function of nash sutcliff efficiency nse was used to capture the prediction accuracy in the model ten streamflow five sediment and seven total phosphorus tp calibration parameters were provided into swat cup based on the physiographic characteristics of the watershed as well as from a previous swat model calibration conducted in the same watershed by niazi et al 2015 global sensitivity analysis embedded along with sufi 2 algorithm was used for these parameters simultaneously along with calibration the model performance was evaluated using three metrics including nse percent bias pbias and root mean square error rmse observations standard ratio rsr the monthly simulated streamflow sediment and tp data from the swat model were compared against the respective observed data where the calibration period was from 2003 to 2009 and the validation period was 2010 2015 a two years of warm up period 2001 2002 was given in the model to initialize model parameters 2 2 2 climate change the climate change data in this study was used from seven climate projection general circulation models gcms including ccsm4 national center for atmospheric research csiro mk3 6 0 commonwealth scientific and industrial research organization queensland climate change centre of excellence gfdl esm2g noaa geophysical fluid dynamics laboratory ipsl cm5a lr institut pierre simon laplace miroc5 atmosphere and ocean research institute the university of tokyo and mpi esm lr max planck institute for meteorology earth system model from the latest suite of coupled model intercomparison project phase 5 cmip5 these gcms were selected for this study as these gcms were found to be suitable for north america giri et al 2019 wagena and easton 2018 culbertson et al 2016 cousino et al 2015 these data were downloaded from the united states bureau of reclamation usbr for moderate and high emission scenarios rcp 4 5 and rcp 8 5 respectively for two different time periods 1 1990 2015 and 2 2020 2045 the time period 1991 2015 represents as baseline condition while the time period 2021 2045 reflects the climate change in the future the climate data were downscaled using daily bias correction and constructed analogs bcca statistical downscaling technique to correct the systematic errors in gcms downscaled to a spatial resolution of 1 8 the bcca downscaling method consists of two steps 1 identify and eliminate the abnormal pattern in the projected dataset compared to the observed data using quantile mapping 2 reproject the gcm projection from original resolution to targeted resolution brekke et al 2013 the climate data from the gcms consisted of daily precipitation daily maximum and minimum air temperature while the remaining weather data such as solar radiation wind speed and relative humidity were generated by swat weather generator the total number of 28 scenarios including two different emissions rcp 4 5 and 8 5 along with two time periods baseline and climate change were employed in this study as the primary source of the uncertainty in climate change study originates from the gcms an ensemble mean approach of gcms recommended by most researchers was used in this study molina navarro et al 2018 arheimer and lindstorm 2015 furthermore a paired two sample t test was conducted between monthly observed streamflow data against the simulated average monthly streamflow data at watershed outlet for each gcm as well as for ensemble mean from 2003 to 2015 however out of six gcms the streamflow produced from ipsl cm5a lr gcm was significantly different than observed streamflow presented in the uncertainty analysis in the results section forced us to use the remaining five gcms to produce ensemble mean for this study all the results presented in this study are based on ensemble mean approach 2 2 3 climate change impact on watershed scale each gcm was run separately in the calibrated swat model and the impact of climate change on streamflow surface runoff sediment and tp were estimated on watershed scale using the following equation 1 c h a n g e i n p a r a m e t e r e n s e m b l e c l i m a t e c h a n g e e n s e m b l e b a s e l i n e ensemble b a s e l i n e 100 the parameters for this study were streamflow surface runoff sediment and tp 2 2 4 climate change vulnerability index using analytical hierarchical process multi criteria decision analysis mcda is an effective method for watershed managers and policymakers which considers different factors simultaneously during assessment process in a complex environment the ahp is one of the mcda methods which has been applied in different fields including in engineering martinez martinez et al 2015 bottero et al 2011 economics sharma 2018 saaty 2010 industry rozman et al 2013 wang et al 2001 medicine liem et al 2018 morkunas et al 2018 social science morano et al 2016 escorcia et al 2014 and environmental management giri et al 2014 2016a b giri and nejadhashemi 2014 young et al 2009 the ahp was developed by saaty 1980 and the foundation of ahp lies on matrix formulation and manipulation the ahp consists of four step processes i construction of pairwise comparison matrix ii computation of priority vector iii calculation of consistency ratio iv ranking of alternatives in this study three factors were used to develop the climate change vulnerability index i change in surface runoff that represents potential to flooding ii change in sediment yield which reflects potential to sedimentation in the waterbodies and iii change in phosphorus yield that shows likelihood to eutrophication here we described the detail steps to generate the ranking among subbasins due to change in surface runoff and other two factors change in sediment and phosphorus yield were followed similarly to generate the ranking among subbasins 2 2 4 1 construction of pairwise comparison matrix step 1 the change in surface runoff for each subbasin was the difference of ensemble mean of climate change and baseline scenario the change in surface runoff was calculated for all 51 subbasins in the watershed and thereafter a pairwise comparison matrix was developed among 51 subbasins the final matrix 51 51 represented the criteria judgement matrix where the excess surface runoff of each subbasin was compared against all individual subbasins in the watershed and ranked against each other 2 2 4 2 computation of priority vector step 2 in this step relative vulnerability of each subbasin due to excess surface runoff was evaluated by calculating normalized principal eigenvector of the pairwise comparison matrix saaty 1980 the principal eigenvector was calculated by dividing each entry of the original pairwise comparison matrix generated in the previous step by the column sum of the respective entry the row sum of new matrix was estimated to generate the vulnerability weight of each subbasin due to excess surface runoff 2 2 4 3 calculate consistency ratio step 3 this step was to examine the validity of each entry of subbasin due to excess surface runoff against other subbasins provided during formulation of pairwise comparison matrix in step 1 calculation of consistency ratio was determined through the following steps 1 calculation of maximum eigenvalue 2 determination of consistency index and 3 estimation of consistency ratio first the pairwise comparison matrix developed in step 1 was multiplied with the vulnerability weight of each subbasin developed in step 2 to generate a new matrix further the new matrix was divided by vulnerability weight of each subbasin developed in step 2 to generate the final matrix the final matrix was averaged which produced the maximum eigenvalue the consistency index was calculated by using the following equation saaty 1980 2 consistency i n d e x m a x i m u m e i g e n v a l u e n n 1 where n number of rows or columns in the pairwise comparison matrix developed in step 1 finally the consistency ratio was calculated based on the following equation developed by saaty 1980 3 consistency r a t i o consistency i n d e x refractive i n d e x the refractive index for this study was 1 72 based on 51 rows or columns matrix developed in step 1 alonso and lamata 2006 if the consistency ratio was less than or equal to 0 1 then the pairwise comparison matrix formulated during step 1 was accepted or else the entries in the pairwise comparison matrix in step 1 were readjusted to ensure the validity of entries in the pairwise comparison matrix step 1 to step 3 were repeated separately for estimating vulnerability weight of each subbasin due to excess sediment and phosphorus yield due to climate change for rcp 4 5 and 8 5 scenarios 2 2 4 4 ranking of alternatives step 4 in this step the vulnerability weight of each subbasin due to excess surface runoff sediment yield and phosphorus yield were entered into a single matrix and this matrix was multiplied with three criteria priority vectors potential to flooding potential to sedimentation and potential to eutrophication having equal weight 0 33 to generate the composite vulnerability index due to climate change in the watershed in this way the composite vulnerability index was generated both for rcp 4 5 and 8 5 scenarios 2 2 5 climate adaptation strategies through bmps in this study three bmps including cover crop filter strip and no till were selected for climate change adaptation strategies in the usrw as these bmps were generally accepted by the local farmers these bmps were implemented in the row crops including corn and soybean for two scenarios i corn and soybean located within the csas and ii all corn and soybean fields in the watershed the csas in this study was identified based on pollution load produced per unit area method dong et al 2018 giri et al 2016a b giri et al 2012 tuppad and srinivasan 2008 the climate change scenario pre bmp application was compared with post bmp application of individual bmp to assess the climate adaptation strategies 2 2 5 1 cover crop cover crop is useful management practices in the agricultural field to reduce soil erosion as well as nutrient loss in the surface runoff by extracting nutrients and improving soil health usda nrcs 2011 a rye cover crop rotation was prepared for corn and soybean row crops by planting rye grass after harvest of row crops in october followed by killing of rye grass in the next year april before planting of row crop the primary objective of cover crop was to cover the ground during the absence of row crops 2 2 5 2 filter strip filter strip is a strip of dense permanent vegetation at the edge of the field which filters the sediment and nutrients in the runoff from the upland sources before entering into waterbodies the efficiency of filter strip in reducing pollutants depends on several factors and filter strip width is one of them in swat filter strip is modelled through filter width parameter to estimate sediment and nutrients trapping efficiency using the following equation mtibaa et al 2018 park et al 2011a b 4 trapping efficiency 0 367 filter width 0 2967 the filter strip width of 15 m was considered for this study based on the recommendation by niazi et al 2012 in the usrw 2 2 5 3 no till in no till soil is kept undisturbed after harvest of crop to planting of next crop leaving the residues on the field during planting minimum soil disturbance is preferred using a no till equipment rather than conventional method no till reduces sheet and rill erosion as well as accumulates soil organic matter which improves overall soil health no till was incorporated in the swat by removing the conventional tillage practices such as chisel plow from the original crop rotation and incorporating generic no till mixing increasing manning s roughness coefficient to 0 3 and reducing the curve number by two jeon et al 2018 almendinger and ulrich 2017 giri et al 2014 bosch et al 2013 3 results 3 1 model performance and uncertainty analysis the swat model performance for streamflow sediment and tp are presented in table 2 on monthly time step overall the model performance for streamflow was categorized as very good due to nse greater than 0 75 rsr less than 0 50 and pbias less than 10 moriasi et al 2007 based on these three model evaluation parameters streamflow was considered as good 0 65 nse 0 75 10 pbias 15 0 50 rsr 0 60 for calibration period while it was classified as very good for validation period the hydrograph generated after model calibration showed very good agreement between observed and simulated streamflow fig 3 however few peaks were underestimated by swat model which might be due to measurement error associated with precipitation and streamflow in the field as well as inability of swat model to capture the flashiness of the watershed nonetheless the overall model performance of very good category depicts that swat model can be used for climate change vulnerability and adaptation strategies study on watershed scale the overall model performance for sediment and tp was classified as good based on the guideline developed by moriasi et al 2007 the time series comparison plot between observed and simulated sediment and tp load during calibration and validation period is presented in figs s1 and s2 in the supplementary material these plots also depicted good agreement between observed and simulated data with some exception of few underestimated peaks there is a general consensus among researchers that the primary uncertainty in climate change study comes from the gcms molina navarro et al 2018 trolle et al 2015 jensen and veihe 2009 therefore gcms were compared visually fig 4 as well as using a paired two sample t test table 3 for rcp 8 5 emission scenario the visual comparison showed that the streamflow was highest during spring and lowest during summer while it showed an increasing trend during fall season this general trend was observed from individual gcms ensemble mean and observed streamflow compared to individual gcms ensemble mean showed better agreement with observed streamflow fig 4 which corroborated our analyses of using ensemble mean approach in this study the paired two sample t test depicted that all the streamflow from individual gcms except ipsl cm5a lr were statistically insignificant with observed streamflow at 5 level of confidence due to p value greater than 0 05 table 3 which forced us to eliminate ipsl cm5a lr during ensemble mean calculation during analyses in this climate change vulnerability and adaptation strategies study teutschbein and seibert 2012 also recommended to consider only good performance model in the current scenario over poor performance model during climate change study as a good performance model in the current scenario is more likely to perform better in the future rather than already a poor performing model in the current condition like rcp 8 5 a similar results were found among individual gcms compared to observed streamflow for rcp 4 5 emission scenario where individual gcms as well as ensemble mean were not significantly different than observed streamflow fig s3 and table s1 supplementary material 3 2 potential impacts of climate change on hydrology and water quality future temperature projection in both rcp scenarios showed a similar trend to baseline where maximum temperature was observed during july and minimum temperature was found in january table 4 overall the average monthly mean temperature increased from january to july in a linear fashion and decreased from july to january consistently however percent change in temperature indicated that a maximum 136 rise in temperature baseline 0 82 c to climate change 1 94 c was observed during january while a minimum increase in temperature baseline 22 70 c to climate change 23 40 c was noticed during june due to climate change in the rcp 4 5 emission scenario similarly maximum increase in temperature 130 was observed during january due to climate change however minimum surge in temperature was found in may instead of june in the rcp 8 5 emission scenario the average annual increase in temperature ranged from 7 37 to 8 44 for rcp 4 5 and 8 5 scenarios respectively due to climate change in both emission scenarios temperature increase was highest during winter compared to other seasons like temperature the future precipitation projection depicted a similar trend to baseline where maximum precipitation was displayed during august while minimum precipitation was demonstrated during february for both emission scenarios table 5 however percentage of change in precipitation analysis showed a different trend among two emission scenarios for example increase in precipitation was observed among all the months except october and november for rcp 4 5 emission scenario while increase in precipitation was noticed among all the months during rcp 8 5 emission scenario maximum 12 27 increase in precipitation baseline 102 34 mm to climate change 114 90 mm was observed during july and 14 72 in april baseline 91 11 to climate change 104 52 mm for rcp 4 5 and 8 5 emission scenarios respectively other noticeable fact among two emission scenarios was higher increase in precipitation during summer and early fall for rcp 4 5 scenario while it was during winter and early spring for rcp 8 5 scenario overall an annual increase in precipitation of 5 63 and 6 49 was observed due to climate change based on rcp 4 5 and 8 5 emission scenarios respectively due to projected increase in temperature and precipitation a change in water budget components were observed in the climate change scenarios compared to baseline in the usrw fig 5 all four water budget components evapotranspiration groundwater surface runoff and lateral flow displayed an increasing trend in the climate change scenarios out of all four components the gained in lateral flow due to climate change was least 3 mm for both rcp scenarios in contrast the highest gained more than 30 mm was observed for groundwater for both scenarios the second highest gained was found for evapotranspiration 20 mm followed by surface runoff the surface runoff increased from 154 mm baseline to 162 mm climate change for rcp 4 5 scenario while it rose from 151 mm baseline to 166 mm climate change based on rcp 8 5 scenario overall the quantity of water represented in water budget component in the usrw was in the decreasing order of evapotranspiration followed by groundwater surface runoff and lateral flow for both climate change and baseline scenarios projected increase in precipitation resulted into increased surface and subsurface runoff in this study increased temperature 7 34 with a concomitant increased precipitation 5 63 caused a surge of evapotranspiration 3 50 in the watershed while increased precipitation 5 63 caused a surge in groundwater 30 mm in our study under climate change due to projected increase in groundwater surface runoff and lateral flow the streamflow in the usrw was forecasted to increase in the climate change scenarios in fact 8 0 and 9 0 increased average annual streamflow was observed at the watershed outlet based on rcp 4 5 and 8 5 scenarios respectively fig 6 as expected due to increase in precipitation 5 0 and 10 rise in surface runoff was observed based on rcp 4 5 and 8 5 scenarios respectively fig 6 mean annual sediment was predicted to increase by 8 and 14 compared to baseline in the watershed based on rcp 4 5 and 8 5 scenarios respectively fig 6 the increase in sediment in the climate change scenarios was due to higher surface runoff coupled with higher intensity of precipitation during winter and early spring table 5 when agricultural fields were uncovered aforementioned reasons enhanced soil erosion and sediment yield in the hrus resulting into export of sediment from hrus to watershed outlet relative to baseline the mean annual tp was predicted to decrease by 1 8 and increase by 5 6 based on rcp 4 5 and 8 5 scenarios respectively fig 6 the detail breakdown analysis of tp showed an increasing trend of organic phosphorus while decreasing trend of mineral phosphorus in climate change scenarios compared to baseline fig 7 however the increment of organic phosphorus relative to baseline in rcp 8 5 scenario was much higher compared to rcp 4 5 scenario meanwhile the reduction of mineral phosphorus relative to baseline was lesser in rcp 8 5 scenario compared to rcp 4 5 the organic phosphorus in the stream consists of sediment phosphorus attached to soil particle and phosphorus present in biological materials including plants and animals their dead bodies and waste products greater surface runoff accompanied with higher intensity of precipitation during winter and early spring having less ground cover period resulted into approximately twice more sediment in rcp 8 5 scenario compared to rcp 4 5 fig 6 this resulted into higher organic phosphorous in rcp 8 5 scenario which altered the negative trend of tp to positive relative to baseline 3 3 development of individual as well as composite climate change vulnerability index individual climate change vulnerability index due to change in surface runoff change in sediment and phosphorus yield as well as composite vulnerability index was generated in the usrw using ahp framework the vulnerability index was categorized into three vulnerability classes including high medium and low categories for both rcp 4 5 and 8 5 scenarios figs 8 and 9 out of total 51 subbasins in the usrw 10 subbasins were classified as highly vulnerable to flooding due to increased surface runoff 17 subbasins were categorized as moderately vulnerable while remaining 24 subbasins were identified as least vulnerable based on rcp 4 5 scenario fig 8a the average percentage of subbasin area consisting of urban land for highly moderately and least vulnerable area to flooding was approximately 23 12 9 72 and 3 31 respectively increased precipitation due to climate change coupled with presence of higher urban land higher the impervious surface in the highly vulnerable areas increased the magnitude of surface runoff in the climate change scenario resulting into larger risk to flooding based on increase in sediment yield due to climate change 15 subbasins in the usrw were characterized as highly vulnerable to sedimentation 14 subbasins were classified as moderately vulnerable and 22 subbasins were categorized as least vulnerable based on rcp 4 5 scenario fig 8b land use cover lulc played a critical role between highly and moderately vulnerable areas versus least vulnerable areas in the watershed the average percentage of subbasin area contributing to agricultural land was approximately 73 for both highly and moderately vulnerable areas while it was nearly 57 for least vulnerable areas additionally average percentage of subbasin area contributing to forested land was roughly 9 for both highly and moderately vulnerable areas while it was nearly 12 8 for least vulnerable areas higher percentage of agricultural land coupled with lesser forested area differentiated between highly and moderately vulnerable area versus least vulnerable area when highly and moderately vulnerable areas were compared among each other same soil types were observed between two however higher slope in highly vulnerable areas played a primary role in categorizing areas between highly versus moderately vulnerable areas to sedimentation in the watershed based on change in tp yield under rcp 4 5 scenario usrw was divided into highly 8 subbasins moderately 10 subbasins and least vulnerable areas 33 subbasins fig 8c unlike change in surface runoff and sediment yield where all subbasins showed an increasing trend in the future climate change compared to baseline the tp yield in the usrw depicted both positive and negative yield during future climate change therefore the negative tp yield was designated as least vulnerable areas to eutrophication while the positive tp yield was further divided into highly and moderately vulnerable areas to eutrophication the negative trend of tp in some subbasins was due to reduction in soluble phosphorus under future climate change compared to baseline fig s4 supplementary material while the positive trend was due to combination of increased sediment and organic phosphorus in the future climate change compared to baseline fig s5 and s6 based on composite vulnerability index under rcp 4 5 scenario 9 subbasins 23 subbasins and remaining 19 subbasins were classified as highly vulnerable moderately vulnerable and least vulnerable areas respectively in the usrw fig 8d the highly moderately and least vulnerable areas based on increased in surface runoff increased in sediment yield and change in phosphorus yield as well as composite vulnerability under rcp 8 5 scenario is presented in fig 9 based on increased in surface runoff 15 subbasins 14 subbasins and 22 subbasins were classified as highly vulnerable moderately vulnerable and least vulnerable areas respectively in the usrw fig 9a compared to rcp 4 5 scenario the number of subbasins under highly vulnerable area increased under rcp 8 5 due to more intense precipitation under rcp 8 5 compared to rcp 4 5 fig 8a and 9a table 5 based on increased in sediment yield 9 subbasins were classified as highly vulnerable 25 subbasins were categorized as moderately vulnerable and remaining 17 subbasins were assigned as least vulnerable to sedimentation fig 9b relative to rcp 4 5 scenario more subbasins were classified as moderately vulnerable areas under rcp 8 5 and these additional subasins came from low vulnerability area under rcp 4 5 scenario to moderately vulnerable area under rcp 8 5 scenario due to greater sediment yield as a result of more surface runoff based on change in tp yield the usrw was divided into highly vulnerable area 12 subbasins moderately vulnerable area 32 subbasins and least vulnerable area 7 subbasins to eutrophication fig 9c compared to rcp 4 5 scenario lesser number of subbasins showed decrease in tp yield due to increase in sediment and organic phosphorus under rcp 8 5 scenario compared to rcp 4 5 scenario figs s5 and s6 supplementary material finally under composite vulnerability index 13 subbasins were classified as highly vulnerable areas 23 subbasins were categorized as moderately vulnerability areas and remaining 15 subbasins were assigned as least vulnerable areas fig 9d in the usrw 3 4 climate adaptation strategies through bmps 3 4 1 application of bmps in row crops inside csas the bmps were implemented only in the agricultural hrus of the csas of respective pollutants under rcp 4 5 and 8 5 scenarios the effectiveness of bmps on two primary water fluxes streamflow and surface runoff under future climate change scenarios are presented in the fig 10 none of the bmps were effective in reducing streamflow compared to no bmp application under both rcp 4 5 and 8 5 scenarios fig 10a and b this indicted that these bmps were not effective in reducing streamflow in the watershed scale another possible explanation of bmp ineffectiveness towards reducing streamflow may be the lesser bmp application area 10 and 12 9 of total watershed area under rcp 4 5 and 8 5 respectively for surface runoff all bmps except no till were ineffective in reducing surface runoff compared to no bmp under climate change scenario fig 10c and d no till bmp reduced approximately 2 2 and 2 9 of surface runoff under rcp 4 5 and 8 5 scenarios respectively compared to no bmp under climate change the undisturbed soil coupled with residue over the entire field increases the surface roughness in the field which may slowdown the surface runoff under climate change scenarios unlike water fluxes all bmps were effective in reducing pollutants sediment and tp compared to no bmp scenario under both climate change conditions on watershed scale fig 11 for sediment reduction all bmps showed consistency in reducing sediment under two emission scenarios fig 11a and b cover crop filter strip and no till reduced 1 1 1 8 and 1 8 sediment load respectively compared to no bmp scenario under rcp 4 5 scenario while they reduced 1 3 1 8 and 1 8 sediment load respectively under rcp 8 5 scenario the bmp application area were 9 5 and 10 7 of total watershed area under rcp 4 5 and 8 5 scenarios respectively like sediment all bmps were also effective in reducing tp under both climate change scenarios fig 11c and d cover crop filter strip and no till decreased tp in the watershed by 2 8 9 and 0 2 respectively compared to no bmp application under rcp 4 5 scenario while the reduction efficiency of these bmps increased to 4 1 12 2 and 0 6 respectively under rcp 8 5 scenario in the usrw the increased in tp reduction efficiency by these bmps in rcp 8 5 scenario compared to rcp 4 5 was due to increase in bmp application area from 6 9 rcp 4 5 scenario to 10 8 rcp 8 5 scenario when tp effectiveness of bmps were compared among these three bmps the highest reduction was found in filter strip followed by cover crop and no till 3 4 2 application of bmps in all row crops corn and soybean in this scenario bmps were implemented in all the corn and soybean fields 46 of total watershed area one at a time to evaluate the effectiveness of bmps to negate climate change impact at watershed scale although the bmp application area was increased to 46 of total watershed area a similar insignificant effect of bmps were noticed to reduce streamflow under both climate change scenarios fig 12 a and b in case of surface runoff similar results were found among the bmps as observed in section 3 4 1 when bmp effectiveness was compared among the bmps none of the bmps except no till were effective in reducing surface runoff under climate change scenarios fig 12 c and d no till reduced 9 5 to 10 of surface runoff as opposed to 2 to 3 section 3 4 1 under climate change scenarios compared to no bmp scenario this demonstrates that increase in bmp application area increased the efficiency of surface runoff reduction by no till under climate change when bmp effectiveness in reducing sediment was compared among the bmps no till was most effective followed by cover crop and filter strip fig 13 a and b in fact cover crop filter strip and no till reduced 2 3 2 and 5 sediment load at watershed outlet respectively under climate change scenario compared to no bmp application when bmp effectiveness was compared to section 3 4 1 bmp application area had slight impact in increasing sediment reduction efficiency at watershed outlet however a detail sediment reduction analysis in the subbasins by these bmps showed a 15 to 30 sediment load reduction figs s7 and s8 this higher percentage of sediment load reduction by these bmps at subbasins level did not translate into watershed outlet which may be due to higher sediment generation due stream bed downcutting and stream bank erosion during routing phase in the river channel the effectiveness of bmps except no till in reducing tp is clearly visible from the fig 13 c and d for both climate change scenarios the reduction of tp at watershed outlet ranged from 1 to 44 among the bmps the highest percentage of tp reduction 44 was observed in filter strip followed by cover crop 13 14 and no till 1 when tp reduction was compared with section 3 4 1 increase in tp reduction was noticed with rise in bmp application area for filter strip and cover crop for cover crop the tp reduction increased form 4 to 14 while it elevated from 12 to 44 for filter strip however insignificant increase in tp reduction was observed for no till 4 discussion this study permits a more nuanced investigation of climate change vulnerability assessment using ahp framework as well as testing bmps as climate adaptation strategies to negate climate change effect results demonstrates that approximately 1 c average annual rise in temperature in the watershed for both climate change scenarios meanwhile temporal analysis shows a sharp rise in temperature during winter season the projected precipitation depicts nearly 5 5 annual increase in precipitation for both climate change scenarios however the precipitation in rcp 8 5 scenario appears to be more pronounced than the precipitation in rcp 4 5 and more precipitation are expected when agricultural fields are less covered winter and early spring our findings on projected temperature and precipitation under climate change are consistent with other researchers for example the climate change study of verma et al 2015 demonstrates an increase of 4 3 c temperature and 5 6 precipitation relative to baseline in the great lakes watersheds furthermore eum et al 2017 indicates 3 3 c rise of temperature and 7 10 increase in precipitation in a climate change study in the athabasca river basin alberta canada the increase in temperature coupled with higher intense precipitation during winter and early spring will alter the hydrologic cycles nutrient cycle and sediment transport in the watershed our findings on water budget component trends evapotranspiration groundwater surface runoff and lateral flow in our study echo with the findings of other researchers projected increase in precipitation resulted into increased surface and subsurface runoff in this study which is consistent with shrestha et al 2017 as well as wagena and easton 2018 in a canadian watershed and chesapeake bay watershed in u s respectively furthermore increased air temperature in the climate change scenarios increases soil temperature which increases soil hydraulic conductivity facilitating more infiltration and ultimately higher subsurface runoff components groundwater and lateral flow in the climate change scenario this outcome is consistent with the results of giri et al 2019 in climate change study on different water fluxes in the neshanic river watershed in new jersey usa increasing evaporation trend in climate change scenarios is corroborated by the outcomes of ficklin et al 2009 they also demonstrated an increase of 2 8 evapotranspiration with a surge of 6 4 c temperature while keeping the precipitation constant with baseline in a climate change irrigation water demand study in a central california watershed rise in groundwater in climate change scenarios is unequivocally supported by the outcomes of park et al 2011a b who demonstrated 34 mm increased groundwater in the chungju dam watershed in south korea with an increase in 12 9 precipitation accompanied by surge in 1 9 c temperature in a climate change study projected increased streamflow with a concomitant increased surface runoff displays a potential to worsen flooding scenario in the watershed specially during spring season higher intensity of precipitation during winter and early spring more specifically under rcp 8 5 scenario will likely to increase the peak flow in the watershed resulting into flooding byun et al 2019 also predicted greater flood risks in most of the watersheds located in the midwest and great lakes region due to greater increase in precipitation during winter and spring season the findings of streamflow surface runoff sediment and tp in different watersheds around the globe under climate change scenario are presented in table 6 our finding of streamflow 8 9 increase is consistent with verma et al 2015 who predicted 9 7 increase in streamflow in the maumee river watershed in ohio u s with 5 6 rise in average annual precipitation coupled with 4 3 c increased temperature additionally bosch et al 2014 forecasted an average 12 rise in streamflow from four mid western watersheds located in ohio and michigan region under 6 rise in average annual precipitation accompanied with 5 0 c increased temperature similarly rising surface runoff trend 5 10 in our study is echoed by many researchers marcinkowski et al 2017 observed an approximately 7 increase in average annual surface runoff in the upper narew catchment in poland due to climate change combination of 2 0 c rise in temperature and 9 5 increase in precipitation furthermore wagena and easton 2018 found 5 increase in average annual surface runoff due to 6 5 increase in annual precipitation coupled with 2 2 c rise in temperature in the chesapeake bay watershed in north east u s increasing trends in sediment loads 8 14 are consistent with the results of other studies nilawar and waikar 2019 also predicted 8 5 increase in sediment in the purna river watershed in india due to 7 7 rise in precipitation combined with 1 0 c increase in temperature in a climate change study additionally khoi and thang 2017 reported 12 8 increased sediment in the climate change scenario which consisted of 1 7 increase in annual precipitation coupled with 0 9 c rise in temperature in the 3s river basin in cambodia vietnam region trends of tp 1 8 to 5 6 in our study is corroborated by the outcomes of other studies including park et al 2011a b and bosch et al 2014 park et al 2011a b also forecasted 4 1 decrease and 19 6 increase in tp due to 3 4 and 27 3 increase in sediment relative to baseline in a climate change study in chungju dam watershed in south korea additionally bosch et al 2014 predicted a decrease and increase in average annual tp yield by 0 5 and 7 8 in maumee river watershed ohio under moderate and pronounced climate change condition respectively increased surface runoff exports more sediment and tp from landscapes resulting into increase of csas in the watershed the increase in csas in the watershed will generate excess amount of new pollutants which will export into the rivers and streams in the watershed leading to further exacerbating the water quality renkenberger et al 2017 also reported increasing pattern of sediment tn and tp csas leading to export of more pollutants relative to baseline condition in the greensboro river watershed located in maryland under future climate change this increasing pollution generating phenomena under future climate creates more pressure on regulatory agencies including new jersey department of environmental protection to restore the already degraded water in the usrw without any innovative strategy it is not only impossible to achieve the water quality goal but also difficult to maintain the status quo of current loading under climate change the vulnerability assessment using ahp framework in the usrw represents a holistic approach to nullify the climate change effect for policymakers and practitioners depending on the priority under resource constraint policymakers could focus on the vulnerable areas in the watershed for example if flooding is priority then they should provide emphasis on flood vulnerable areas in the watershed however it is recommended to give importance to high vulnerable areas identified under composite vulnerability index scenario to counter the effect of climate change and maintain sustainability in the environment this innovative way of application of ahp permits us to formulate an effective decision support system by identifying highly vulnerable areas in the watershed from multi factors prospective simultaneously flooding sedimentation and eutrophication substantial increase in impervious surface in highly flood vulnerable area differentiated from moderately and least vulnerable area in the watershed under climate change this finding is consistent with zhou et al 2019 who concluded that urbanization particularly increased impervious surface under climate change is one of the primary drivers that impacts on surface runoff followed by increasing the flooding risks in the watershed sediment vulnerable areas were stand out due to higher agricultural land coupled with higher slope compared to other areas in the watershed this finding is echoed with the outcomes of other researchers around the globe including giri et al 2019 shrestha and wang 2018 white et al 2009 and tripathi et al 2003 testing three common agricultural bmps in the usrw displays a potential avenue to offset the effect of climate change on sediment and tp load in the stream however these bmps showed no effect on reducing streamflow even after increasing bmp application area to 46 of total watershed other researchers also found similar results wagena and easton 2018 noticed that filter strip and no till had little to no effect in reducing streamflow under climate change in the susquehanna river watershed chesapeake bay where the bmp application area was 30 furthermore bosch et al 2014 observed that combination of agricultural bmps including no till cover crops and filter strip only at 100 implementation level were able to offset the streamflow discharge due to climate change in the maumee river watershed in ohio only no till reduced surface runoff to some extent 2 to 3 or 9 5 to 10 depending upon the bmp application area however it did not create an overall impact on streamflow her et al 2017 found that no till bmp was able to reduce approximately 9 surface runoff under current climate condition in the st joseph river watershed midwest u s furthermore wallace et al 2017 determined that applying no till to all crop lands in a midwestern watershed reduced 22 25 surface runoff under climate change scenario one of the possible explanation for ineffectiveness of bmps in reducing water fluxes streamflow and surface runoff is that these three bmps cover crop filter strip and no till are generally applied to control sediment and nutrients rather than streamflow consequently other bmps which are designed more towards controlling surface runoff could be tested in the watershed to control the surface runoff and ultimately to streamflow in contrast these bmps demonstrates effectiveness in reducing sediment and tp relative to no bmp scenario under climate change which is a positive sign for policymakers and watershed mangers to plan alternative strategies to maintain the water quality in the river and streams under climate change our hypothesis of rise in bmp application area increases pollution reduction proved to be correct in case of sediment and tp reduction under climate change scenarios however bmps were lesser effective 2 5 in reducing sediment based on watershed outlet as compared to sediment reduction in the fields 15 30 sediment reduction at watershed outlet is the combination of sediment reduction at fields plus increasing decreasing of sediment load during routing phase through river channel therefore we believe that erosion in stream bank and stream bed due to increased streamflow under climate change offsetting the actual sediment reduction efficiency by bmps at watershed outlet qiu and wang 2014 also pointed out the major source of sediment in a new jersey watershed was the stream itself where the stream contributed approximately 60 of the total sediment load due to erosion in the stream bank coupled with resurface of deposited sediment in the streambed during high streamflow furthermore our outcome is corroborated by another study conducted by giri et al 2019 in neshanic river watershed in new jersey where they observed increased sediment load at the watershed outlet after considering channel routing under climate change scenarios in contrast to sediment reduction by bmps at watershed outlet tp reduction by bmps with increasing bmp application area increased significantly except no till insignificant reduction of tp by no till is due to the fact that no till reduces the phosphorus associated with sediment while it facilitates dissolve phosphorus readily available at soil surface her et al 2017 giri et al 2012 bundy et al 2001 therefore the overall reduction of tp by no till is minimal in contrast maximum tp 44 was reduced by filter strip which is a good sign to reduce negative impact of climate change maximum reduction of tp by filter strip is due to removal of sediment bound phosphorus through deposition as well as extraction of soluble phosphorus al wadaey et al 2012 other researchers also found a similar results of bmps effectiveness in reducing sediment and tp under climate change bosch et al 2014 observed that combination of three bmps cover crop filter strip and no till in approximately 20 of the watershed area having row crop reduced 10 of sediment yield in the maumee river watershed in ohio under moderate climate change condition higher sediment reduction in their study compared to ours was due to lesser erosive channel compared to more erosive channel in our study area coupled with combination of three bmps simultaneously wagena and easton 2018 observed that filter strip and no till reduced the export of tp by 14 2 to 16 4 and 3 4 to 5 4 respectively compared to no bmp scenario under climate change in a chesapeake bay watershed lesser bmp efficiency in reducing tp for filter strip under climate change in their study was due to lesser bmp application area compared to our study increasing bmp application area under climate change also increased the amount of pollution reduction which is confirmed from our analysis sections 3 4 1 and 3 4 2 consequently based on the requirement of pollution reduction under climate change the bmp application area can be increased to fulfill the steep pollution reduction goal additionally combination bmps could be tested in the future to support pollution reduction goal due to more pronounced climate change in this paragraph we highlight the following major and unique contributions from this study i fate and transport of tp under climate change scenarios ii identifying individual as well as composite climate vulnerability index to flooding sedimentation and eutrophication due to climate change using ahp framework iii reduction of sediment loads by bmps was less distinct compared to their tp reduction capacity and iv no till was more effective in reducing sediment while it had little to no impact on tp reduction under climate change relative to baseline tp load at the watershed outlet found to be decreasing and increasing trend for rcp 4 5 and 8 5 scenarios respectively a further detail analysis showed an increasing trend of organic phosphorus compared to baseline in rcp 8 5 is greater than rcp 4 5 while the reduction of mineral phosphorus compared to baseline in rcp 8 5 is lesser than rcp 4 5 greater surface runoff concomitant with higher intensity of precipitation increased the sediment load twice in rcp 8 5 scenario compared to rcp 4 5 which attributed to higher organic phosphorus load in rcp 8 5 scenario compared to rcp 4 5 the reduction trend of mineral phosphorus in both rcp scenarios could be the effect of elevated co2 under climate change which could extract more soluble phosphorus by the plants leaving lesser soluble phosphorus available for surface runoff introduction of ahp framework to identify composite as well as individual climate vulnerability index to flooding sedimentation and eutrophication is the unique contribution from this study which will help watershed managers and policymakers to target the subject of their interest based on science based information to design a climate adaptation strategies the lesser effectiveness of bmps to control sediment load at watershed outlet was may be due to more sediment generation as a result of stream bed downcutting and streambank erosion during stream routing phase as these bmps demonstrated 15 30 sediment reduction efficiency on the overland finally no till bmp had little to no impact on tp reduction while it was effective in sediment reduction the aforementioned trend was may be due to fact that no till reduces the phosphorus associated with sediment while it facilitates dissolve phosphorus readily available at soil surface 5 conclusions this study assessed the climate change vulnerability using an innovative ahp framework as well as tested three agricultural bmps as adaptation strategies to compensate the climate change effect in a southern new jersey watershed results indicated that rise in temperature and precipitation will increase water fluxes surface runoff and streamflow and deteriorate water quality increase sediment and tp load in the watershed higher intensity of precipitation was observed during winter and early spring while higher temperature was noticed during winter the amount of reduction of mineral phosphorus relative to baseline in the climate change scenarios played vital role on overall increasing decreasing trend of tp the ahp framework permitted us to develop a composite vulnerability index considering excess surface runoff sediment and tp yield due to climate change which presented potential to flooding sedimentation and eutrophication respectively agricultural bmps were effective in reducing water quality due to climate change however they had little to no impact on streamflow and surface runoff in order to control water fluxes due to climate change following items could be tested in the future i other bmps could be examined in the watershed ii as well as combination of bmps identified highly vulnerability areas based on composite vulnerability index should be targeted by watershed managers and policymakers to negate the climate change consequences in the watershed the approach developed in this study can be applied to other regions in the world and it will provide science based information

5982,the crescent moon spring is a unique scenic spot located in an aeolian sand environment of northwestern china the water level of this spring has continuously declined in recent decades causing both the government and many scholars great concern to better understand its hydrologic structure this study investigated the origin of the spring and its recharge sources based on the hydrochemical and isotopic 18o 2h and 3h composition of 56 water samples collected along the groundwater flow path the results indicate the spring is a window into the groundwater table cut out of low lying terrain in sand dunes with the geographic and sedimentary conditions affecting its genesis and hydrochemistry the spring and shallow sedimentary aquifers are recharged primarilyby river water while deep bedrock aquifers are recharged by deep lateral groundwater flow via fault zones in the piedmont of the qilian mountains the results of recharge altitude calculations demonstrate a possible groundwater supply from deep bedrock aquifers to the south of spring the recorded environmental 3h content varied from 11 to 40 t u indicating the groundwater is primarilyrecharged by glacier meltwater from modern precipitation with only a small fraction from pre modern times end member analysis using cl and δ18o shows recharge ratios of influentwater from the dang river and deep groundwater represent about 43 and 22 of the lake water respectively with artificial recharge accounting for the remaining 35 regional hydrogeological conditions arid climate and sand deposition have negative influences on the maintenance of lake water levels but observed regional groundwater level declines resulting from the construction of the dang river reservoir seepage from drainage canals and excessiveexploitation of groundwater are the most important factors contributing to the ecological crisis in the study area these results provide insights into the origin and recharge sources of the crescent moon spring that will guide efforts to preserve the water level keywords groundwater recharge sources hydrochemistry isotopic evidence crescent moon spring 1 introduction crescent moon spring 94 40 09 99 e 40 05 11 98 n is a natural heritage site and has been a world class tourist destination in a desert oasis for more than 1000 years it is located about 6 km south of dunhuang city gansu province northwest china fig 1 the name crescent moon spring is derived from its resemblance to a crescent moon as it is exposed as a crescent shaped lake hereafter referred to as the lake that has existed for more 2000 years countless tourists are attracted to the site due to its reputation as a miraculous and scenic spot however the lake s water level has been falling over the past 60 years with its area noticeably shrinking its maximum width decreased from 90 m in 1955 to 35 m in 2007 during which time the average water depth decreased by approximately 0 12 m y li et al 2014 the water level was about 1134 m above sea level in 2010 the area of the lake in the 1950 s was 14 650 m2 and its average depth was 5 m with a maximum depth of 7 5 m huang and wu 1993 but beginninginthe 1980 s lake water was directly pumped to irrigate nearby farmland for several years as a result of excessive pumping the water level dropped sharply and the steep south and north banks collapsed which resulted in huge amounts of silt deposited on the lake bottom the average depth of the lake was less than 1 0 m in 1980 li 1998 and from 1987 to 1997 the area of the lake shrank from 9000 to 5667 m2 and the maximum water depth dropped from 4 2 to 2 m the worst situation occurred in 2001 when the maximum depth was only 0 18 m and the lake was essentially bottom up sangjimeiduo 2005 overthepastthreedecades the increase in agriculture and tourism decline in regional groundwater levels and degradation of the ecological environment on the alluvial plain of the dunhuang basin have become a concern for the sustainable development of the local society and economy the shrinking of the lake was of particular concern and led to an urgent requirement to identify the origin and recharge sources of the lake farmland area increased from 106 km2 in 1950 to 278 km2 in 2007 in the dunhuang region yi et al 2010 before the 1960s water from the dang river was used mostly for drinking and partly for irrigation but irrigation increased rapidly after the river was dammed in 1975 because the dang river reservoir did not provide enough water for the fast expanding population and agricultural activities groundwater supplies were tapped with deep wells the number of irrigation wells increased from only about 400 in 1971 to 1134 in 1997 and to 3179 in 2007 the annual groundwater exploitation in dunhuang city was 31 300 000 m3 in 1977 and increased to 58 830 000 m3 in 1999 and to more than 130 840 000 m3 in 2007 yi et al 2010 as a result of over exploitation the regional groundwater table has fallen by more than 10 m sangjimeiduo 2005 with the rate decreasing by as much as 0 3 0 4 m y since the 1960 s understanding the natural recharge conditions of the lake is important for establishing a new and sustainable water resource management approach in the region crescent moon spring is an incredible natural phenomenon that owes its existence to a unique combination of hydrogeological conditions landforms environment and wind directions however the formation of the lake remains to be fully understood water level changes in the lake reflect temporal variation in groundwater recharge which is affected not only by hydrogeological conditions precipitation dune altitude and geomorphologic features winter 1986 cao et al 2010 townley and trefry 2000 zlotnik et al 2007 but also intensive anthropogenic activities in this arid region determining groundwater recharge sources is difficult using conventional water balance and or hydraulics methods wang et al 2015 compared to traditional hydrological methods methodologies based on the use of environmental tracers have intrinsic advantages and provide a more promising approach for understanding hydrological systems ranging from small local catchment areas to large regional basins cook and herczeg 2012 matsumoto et al 2017 integrated hydrogeochemical and isotopic studies can be helpful for elucidating recharge sources water rock interactions and hydrogeochemical evolutional processes of natural water bodies ravikumar and somashekar 2011 ma and edmunds 2006 bouchaou et al 2008 vanderzalm et al 2011 diaw et al 2012 these techniques can also be used to identify recharge sources of groundwater estimate the contribution of each member and determine connections between surface and groundwater systems edmunds and tyler 2002 eissa et al 2014 wang et al 2015 in addition in the context of land use changes population growth and climate change the replenishment rate estimated from groundwater age on short time scales can provide very important information for water resource management matsumoto et al 2017 tritium 3h concentration can be used to qualitatively determine whether groundwater is modern although it alone cannot generally be used to quantitatively date groundwater clark and fritz 1997 han et al 2017 matsumoto et al 2017 for example groundwater with 3h concentrations below 3 t u is considered to be least 60 years old pre modern above 3 and less than 20 t u was recharged by local precipitation from 1954 to 1961 and greater than 20 t u is modern zouari et al 2003 ravikumar and somashekar 2011 classified modern groundwater age according to 3h values with values from 1 to 8 t u attributed to a mixture of recent water with old groundwater and groundwater having been subjected to radioactive decay in the most recent two decades many efforts have been made to prevent the lake from disappearing the local government banned land reclamation for cultivation prohibited the drilling of new wells and adopted efficient water saving irrigation practices gansu water management bureau 2011 although these water resource management measures have helped the lake water level continued to fall and in 2008 the local government decided to implement an artificial aquifer recharge project that aimed to maintain and even restore the water level effectively restoring the water level will require a better understanding of the origin and recharge sources of the lake precipitation was found to have an insignificant effect on the lake while contributions from at least two aquifers as well as groundwater flow direction were identified using hydraulic gradient and isotope analysis methods li et al 2014 the influences of the strata sedimentary environment and hydrochemistry on the origin of crescent moon spring lake have also been investigated li et al 2013 however the formation of the lake and recharge proportion from different water sources are still not well understood the objective of this study was to identify and characterize the origin and recharge sources of crescent moon spring lake by integrating isotope 2h 18o and 3h chemistry with hydrogeological and hydrochemical data the approaches and results confirm the formation mechanism and reasons for the shrinking of the lake and provide useful methodology and clues for similar studies in other arid regions 2 geological and hydrogeological setting crescent moon spring is located north of a semi closed low lying depression that is surrounded by the mingsha mountains the chinese word mingsha means singing sand with an exit to the east of the lake the depression is about 500 m long east west and about 290 m wide the mingsha mountains are composed of a series of giant sand dunes in the kumtag desert that stand more than 100 m above the water level of crescent mood spring lake and are aeolian deposits overlying alluvial fans fig 1 geomorphologically the lake is located in the oasis in the southern dunhuang basin that is bounded by the mingsha and sanwei mountains to the southeast and the mazong mountains to the north spreading into the gobi desert to the west fig 1 the dunhuang basin has a drainage area of 6290 8 km2 the oasis covers an area of 1400 km2 and consists of two major irrigation districts that have a total irrigation area of 298 km2 and an irrigation history that spans thousands of years the nanhu irrigation district about 60 km southwest of dunhuang spreads from the sanwei mountains in the southeast to the gobi desert in the northwest with an altitude ranging between 1150 and 1200 m a s l some spring fed reservoirs are distributed throughout this district the dunhuang irrigation district at an elevation ranging from 800 to 1500 m a s l stretches from the southwestern mingsha mountains to the northeastern xihu wetland reserve fig 1 the thick quaternary aquifers in the duanghuang basin are comprised of diluvial and alluvial sediments and some aeolian and lacustrine deposits the basement rocks consist of conglomerate argillaceous sandstone and muddy siltstone that formed during the tertiary period and these materials were cemented by calcareous mud unconfined and semi confined aquifers are made up of unconsolidated quaternary sediments that are hundreds of meters thick they were deposited in the southern foreland and tens of meters from the edge of the basin in the western part of the dunhuang irrigation district the alluvial diluvial aquifers consist of highly permeable cobbles gravels and sands ranging from 200 to 400 m in thickness ma et al 2013 the piezometric level of groundwater ranges from 10 to 50 m deep gansu geology survey 1978 at the northern and eastern edges of the alluvial fans the aquifer comprises inter bedded fine sands and clays and becomes semi confined or confined with piezometric levels of less than 3 m gansu geology survey 1978 in some low lying places groundwater emerges to form puddles due to the shallow groundwater levels at the edges of the alluvial fans groundwater is lost rapidly to the intense evaporation in the region the overall direction of groundwater flow is from the southeast to the northwest ma et al 2013 the geological conditions show crescent moon spring lies in a low lying depression between two alluvial fans one deposited by the dang river some 4 5 km to the west and the other deposited by the xishui river some 6 5 km to the east fig 1b the depression is about 500 m long in e w orientation and about 290 m wide the topography of the lake indicates it is a feature on the upper part of the dang river alluvial pluvial fan lying adjacentto the paleo channel of the dang river and surrounded by grand sand dunes with an exit to the east of the lake fig 2 to the south of the lake the mingsha mountains sand dunes develop while alluvial plains spread to the north fig 1b the lake region is composed of a thick sandy layer holocene alluvial lacustrine deposits muddy silt about 10 m thick formed 11 000 years ago with rich plant roots and snail shells a middle and early pleistocene alluvial pluvial layer approximately 250 m thick with double sectors the upper sector is predominantly medium coarse sands and the lower sector is mainly fine sand and clamping clay sand and late pleistocene alluvial lacustrine sandstone and clay interlayers with fossils jia and cheng 2006 the neogene layer is mainly alluvial lacustrine pelitic sandstone siltstone and pelitic siltstone which occur throughout the basin and at a depth of more than 380 m in the lake region the particle size of sediment tends to be fine from the north to the south of the basin the bedrock of the basin is a pre sinian system which is mainly granite geneiss amphibolite diopite quartz schist and marble with a total thickness of more than 4600 m based on geophysical exploration the depth to the bedrock is more than 600 m in the lake region geo environmental monitoring institute of gansu province 2008 two groups of faults are distributed to the south of lake in the ne sw and e w directions respectively the nearest e w fault is located about 1 km from the lake the ne sw compression and scissor faults are well developed in the piedmont zone of the sanwei and mingsha mountains with the direction consistent with the trend of the sanwei mountains they stretch long and deep occur as the borders of mountains and plains and played an important role in the deposition of thick sediments in the basin the e w tenso shear fractures belong to the second grade fault and its extension length is less than the former geo environmental monitoring institute of gansu province 2008 the surface water in the study area consists of the dang river xishui river and other intermittent streams that flow after storms the dang river originates from the western qilian mountains and is a 390 km long independent drainage system with a catchment area of 1 697 104 km2 zhao et al 2015 it is recharged by precipitation glacier meltwater and groundwater from the qilian mountains where a deep groundwater flow system has developed especially in carbonate aquifers in the dunhuang basin the dang river flows along a channel approximately 60 km long fig 1b and is believed to be the mother river of the dunhuang oasis the surface water in the dunhuang oasis is primarily from the dang river reservoir which was built in 1975 at the southern end of the dunhuang basin and has since been a significant barrier to surface flow into the dunhuang basin ma et al 2013 the study area has a typical continental arid climate with extremely cold winters and hot summers the average annual rainfall is less than 40 mm whereas the annual potential evaporation is up to 2488 mm most rainfall occurs during the east asian summer monsoon season from may to august synchronous with the evaporation peak fig 3 a the monthly mean temperature ranges from 10 5 to 24 7 c fig 3b with a diurnal temperature range of up to 30 c over 3200 h of sunshine occur throughout the year the relative humidity is less than 50 as a result of being landlocked with the ground mainly covered by the gobi desert and sand dunes the study area is obviously characterized by an extreme arid climate rather low rainfall and high evaporation a large temperature difference between day and night long hours of sunshine abundant sand and water source shortages due to the sparse and highly variable rainfall runoff from the surrounding mountains produces no perennial streams that reach the basin only during the occasional year does short term surface flow or shallow groundwater recharge occurs as a result of elevated rainfall therefore most rainfall recharge is limited to the ground surface and makes no contribution to the deeper aquifers 3 material and methods 3 1 sampling procedures and analytical methods twelve observation boreholes have been drilled and are distributed around the lake sk1 sk2 sk3 sk4 sk5 and dj19 and near the side of the oasis g11 g12 g13 g14 g15 and g16 fig 2 they are used to monitor groundwater levels and hydrochemical components as well as the hydrogen and oxygen isotopic composition in the groundwater around the lake all of the observation boreholes are screened with short filters which are installed to monitor the aquifers at specified depths water samples were also collected from the lake rivers and other wells in the study area no long screened wells were sampled to avoid artificial mixing which may impair a correct geochemical characterization of the aquifer to obtain sufficient hydrochemical data field work was carried out in november 2009 and june 2010 a total of 20 representative samples fig 1 and table 1 were collected in november 2009 including four surface water samples and 16 groundwater samples surface water samples were collected from the dang river reservoir the middle reach of the dang river main channel the lower reach of the xishui river and crescent moon springs lake the set of 16 groundwater samples was gathered from the observation boreholes as well as water supply and irrigation wells within the quaternary aquifer across the study area in addition a total of 36 representative samples were collected in june 2010 including seven surface water samples collected from the dang river reservoir 1 sample the main channel of the dang river 5 samples from the upper to lower reaches crescent moon springs lake 1 sample and 29 groundwater samples from the observation boreholes as well as water supply and irrigation wells fig 1 prior to sampling all observation boreholes and wells were pumped continuously for more than 15 min to remove stagnant water samples were filtered on site using 0 45 μm membrane filters and stored in three pre cleaned 250 ml low density polyethylene ldpe bottles for subsequent analyses sub samples for cation analyses were acidified to ph 2 by addition of ultrapure 6 mol l hno3 to stabilize the metals two sub samples were left unacidified for the determination of anions and stable isotopes respectively ph and electrical conductivity ec were measured on site using portable hanna ph and ec meters respectively which were calibrated every day before use the total alkalinity as hco3 was measured by gran titration on the day of sampling major cations were quantified by inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectrometry icp aes iris intrepid ii xsp thermo elemental anions including chloride and sulfate were quantified using ion chromatography ic metrohm 761 compact ic stable isotopes δ2h and δ18o of 29 groundwater samples were measured by isotope ratio mass spectrometry mat 251 the precision of δ2h and δ18o measurements was 1 and 0 1 2σ criterion respectively the 3h content of 17 groundwater samples was measured using a quantulus 1220 liquid scintillation counter preceded by electrolytic enrichment the precision of 3h measurements was 0 5 t u 3σ criterion where 1 t u is 1 atom of 3h in 1018 atoms of hydrogen all analyses were undertaken in the state key laboratory of biogeology and environmental geology china university of geoscience in wuhan major ions and isotopes were analyzed within 2 weeks of sampling analytical precision and accuracy were estimated as better than 5 on the basis of repeated analyses of samples and standard solutions ionic charge balance errors ibe were computed on the basis of ions expressed in meq l with the value of ibe within a limit of 5 3 2 linear end member mixing model a linear end member mixing model clark 2015 han et al 2017 was combined with hydrogeological analysis in this study to quantify the groundwater contribution to the lake and the mixing ratios among various water sources in the case of three end members calculating mixing ratios is possible but requires a second conservative parameter to solve the mixing equations clark 2015 in the present work three mass balance equations are considered the first and second are mass balance equations for each of the solutes in this case the concentrations of cl and δ18o the third is a mass balance of the fractions of end member water in the sample in these generic eqs 1 2 and 3 clark 2015 the subscripts 1 2 and 3 denote three end members for accounting purposes and the subscript m is the water comprised of a mixture of these three end members using two independent parameters for cl and δ18o concentrations the following equations are obtained clark 2015 where cl and δ18o are used in the right hand column of the equations for the case of two independent parameters linear mixing

processes the hydrochemistry of groundwater systems can be greatly affected by topography geology lithology hydrology and climate su and wang 2013 to compare the hydrochemical characteristics of different water bodies in the study area the samples were divided into seven categories from recharge area to discharge area surface water including dang river dang river reservoir and xishui river water groundwater along dang river from downstream of the dang river reservoir to the lake groundwater near the dang river channel crescent moon springs lake water groundwater from observation boreholes around the lake groundwater from observation boreholes far from the lake groundwater from irrigated areas of the lower reaches of the dang river and groundwater from the edge of the dang river alluvial fan the hydrochemical and isotopic data are summarized in tables 1 and 2 4 1 1 hydrochemical characteristics 4 1 1 1 surface water the ph values of surface water ranged from 7 9 to 8 6 with an average of 8 3 table 1 along the dang river from the qingshuigou tributary upstream to the dang river reservoir the total dissolved solids tds gradually increase with the exception of sample dh03 which was sampled from an upstream tributary of the dang river and has a relative lower tds value 136 1 mg l all other samples have tds values ranging from 218 8 to 367 8 mg l average 271 3 mg l table 1 the ph and tds of water samples collected from the dang river reservoir dh07 and ms 01 have values similar to those of river water samples the major ions in water from the dang river and dang river reservoir are hco3 so4 2 ca2 and mg2 fig 4 concentrations of the major ions show similar trends to tds values the xishui river is located in the eastern portion of the study area fig 1b sample xsg03 collected from the xishui river reflects cl hco3 na mg type water fig 4 with a ph of 8 0 the ph of this sample is lower than samples of dang river water while its tds value 1234 mg l is significantly higher than the average for dang river water 271 3 mg l table 1 and fig 4 overall the hydrochemical characteristics of sample xsg03 collected from the xishui river are distinctly different from samples taken from the dang river furthermore a durov diagram shows the composition and water type of dang river water samples are very similar to groundwater samples collected from the nearby dang river channel fig 4 see also table 1 based on the above discussion the recharge source of the groundwater upstream of the lake is thought to be the dang river rather than the xishui river 4 1 1 2 lake water and groundwater around the lake ph values of samples collected from the lake and the observation boreholes range from 7 2 to 9 3 table 1 and fig 4 the ph of samples from closer to the lake range from 8 5 to 9 3 and are higher than samples taken further from the lake ph 7 to 7 95 the tds content of water from observation boreholes close to the lake sk1 sk5 and dj19 fig 2 is generally low ranging from 246 9 to 548 7 mg l across the two sampling campaigns table 1 and fig 4 average tds values of 373 7 mg l in june 2010 and 337 5 mg l in november 2009 are both lower than lake water samples taken at the same time 592 5 mg l in june 2010 and 722 4 mg l in november 2009 table 1 the tds content at the observation boreholes g11 g17 fig 2 far from the lake is comparatively high ranging from 767 6 to 1647 mg l in june 2010 table 1 and fig 4 the average tds values of 1135 mg l in june 2010 and 1150 mg l in november 2009 are both much higher than for lake water the lake experiences strong evaporation due to exposure to air the lake water samples collected in june 2010 and november 2009 reflect so4 hco3 cl mg ca na and so4 hco3 mg type water respectively fig 4 the groundwater collected from the observation boreholes around the lake is mainly hco3 cl mg na type while the majority of groundwater samples collected from group g observation boreholes far from the lake are hco3 mg type fig 4 the different hydrochemical characteristics between group sk and group g samples are mainly attributed to the influence of hydrogeological setting sedimentary environment and long term irrigation the group g observation boreholes are distributed in the inner triangle depression area between the dang river and xishuigou river alluvial diluvial fans as well as in the paleo channel of the dang river the sediment grains in the fan margin are fine which results in rather slow groundwater flow in addition the group g observation boreholes are distributed in the irrigation area which is planted with cotton and fruit trees due to the extreme drought in the region the agricultural activities heavily rely on river water and groundwater irrigation under the strong evaporation salt accumulates in the shallow sediments which leads to higher tds content in the shallow groundwater therefore the paleo geographical conditions and heterogeneous sedimentary environment are thought to have large impact on the groundwater hydrochemistry long term human activity accelerated this change 4 1 1 3 groundwater near the dang river channel and from the irrigation district a total of 19 water samples were collected from water supply wells distributed in the lower reaches of the dang river including one sample from the dang river alluvial fan six near the dang river channel downstream of the dang river reservoir and 12 from the downstream irrigation district fig 1a tds values of groundwater samples collected from near the dang river channel range from 406 1 to 945 5 mg l average 599 2 mg l but are twice as high in the downstream irrigation district north of the lake range 831 9 to 1758 mg l average 1294 mg l table 2 the hydrochemical types of groundwater samples collected from the downstream irrigation district are similar to groundwater near the river channel mainly so4 hco3 cl mg na and hco3 so4 mg na type waters fig 4 4 1 2 hydrochemical evolutional processes from the upper reaches of the dang river to the downstream irrigation district the hco3 concentration decreases gradually while so4 2 and cl concentrations increase with the rate of so4 2 concentration increase being greater than for cl fig 5 a the ca2 concentration gradually decreases while mg2 and na concentrations increase fig 5b therefore from the upper reaches of the dang river to the downstream irrigation district the hydrochemical type of water samples evolves from hco3 so4 ca mg dang river to hco3 so4 mg ca groundwater near dang river channel to hco3 so4 cl mg na ca groundwater around the lake to so4 hco3 cl mg na groundwater in the downstream irrigation district fig 4 generally from the recharge area upper reaches of the dang river to the discharge area downstream irrigation district the groundwater composition changes in space and time becoming more saline table 1 and table 2 the groundwater in the recharge area is dominated by hco3 ca mg type water with low tds while the groundwater in the drainage area is mostly so4 cl na type water with higher tds fig 4 the dominant anions change from hco3 to so4 2 to cl fig 5a and the dominant cations change from ca2 to mg2 to na fig 5b with a corresponding increase in tds fig 4 water types should be a reflection of flow paths mixing processes water rock interactions and evaporation processes su and wang 2013 which result in the change from hco3 ca to so4 cl na type water along the flow paths the hco3 ca type waters generally occur in recharge areas with higher elevation while the cl na type waters occur in low lying discharge areas the intermediate water types result from mixing and hydrogeochemical processes between these two end members adams et al 2001 hco3 ca type waters are primarily formed by the dissolution of carbonate minerals where surface water charged with atmospheric and biogenic co2 percolatesthrough soil into the groundwater adams et al 2001 along the flow path of the groundwater the concentration of na increases due to strong evaporation and na ca ion exchange while the concentration of ca2 tends to decrease due to the solubility control of calcite through the precipitation of carbonate minerals in addition to evaporation and oversaturation with respect to calcium carbonate that can cause a decrease of ca2 concentration in groundwater another possible consideration is differences in ion exchange capacity related to grain sizes in the aquifer matrix su and wang 2013 in the discharge area the downstream irrigation district the fine grain content of sediments increases so groundwater flows more slowly na adsorbed on the mineral surface is prone to exchange with groundwater ca2 and mg2 which results in increasing na concentration and decreasing ca2 and mg2 concentration therefore from the upper reaches of the dang river to the downstream irrigation district the concentrations of na and cl could be further enriched 4 2 recharge sources based on hydrogen and oxygen isotopes 4 2 1 distribution characteristics of stable isotopes the isotopic composition δ2h and δ18o of 42 representative samples of lake water river water and groundwater was analyzed table 1 along the regional groundwater flow path from southwest to northeast surface water is generally recharged by groundwater in the upper and middle reaches of the dang river although frequentinteraction occurs between groundwater and surface water in the lower reaches the river water recharges groundwater results of the stable isotope composition analyses indicate waters from the study area are isotopically fractionated due to evapotranspiration and recharge altitude effects a gradual enrichment in groundwater 18o concentration is observed along the regional groundwater flow path from the upper reaches of the dang river to groundwater in the irrigation area with a notable peak at the lake sample ms fig 6 the lake water has the highest δ18o value due to strong evaporation due to its exposure to air samples dj19 sk4 sk1 and sk2 from near the lake have obviously lower δ18o values relative to other groundwater samples from around the lake fig 6 probably due to differences in recharge sources 4 2 2 groundwater origin stable isotope δ2h and δ18o data were used to explore the origins of lake water and groundwater in the study area as shown in fig 7 water samples collected in june 2010 plot close to the global meteoric water line gmwl δ2h 8δ18o 10 and the local meteoric water line lmwl δ2h 7 51δ18o 0 81 zhao 2017 indicating these waters are directly derived from meteoric precipitation the lmwl was derived from 332 precipitation samples collected from the shule basin from june 2013 to july 2016 zhao 2017 the original δ2h δ18o relationship in the rainfall has obviously been altered by evaporation resulting in rather lower d values in the arid northwestern region of china positive shifts away from the meteoric lines are indicative of evapotranspiration fig 7 the long term isotope data for annualmean rainfall are from the dang river hydrological monitoring station which is located near the dang river reservoir the weighted mean δ18o and δ2h values of 81 precipitation samples collected from the dang river hydrological monitoring station are 7 47 and 56 92 respectively fig 7 zhao 2017 all of the river water and groundwater samples are strongly depleted compared to all of these values confirming that modern precipitation in the study area has a negligible impact on the groundwater both the river water and groundwater samples plotted along the two meteoric water lines indicating these samples are derived from meteoric water fig 7 the simultaneous decreases of δ18o and δ2h values in river water and groundwater samples reflect the effects of cooler climate in the past zhao et al 2015 and different recharge altitudes the dang river originates in the western qilian mountains with the elevation of the snow line at 4640 5070 m the depleted isotope values 12 0 δ18o and 80 0 δ2h in the upstream sections of the dang river are similar to those reported from the dunde ice core from the qinghai tibetan plateau thompson et al 1989 suggesting meltwater from the qilian mountains contributes to the steady runoff of the dang river ma et al 2013 except for sample dh04 collected from the middle reaches of the dang river which is located between the lmwl and gmwl other river water samples fall to the left of these lines samples dh01 and dh03 collected from upstream tributaries of the dang river lie on the lower left side of the gmwl with rather depleted δ2h and δ18o ratios fig 7 indicating their possible origin from high elevation montane recharge or paleo recharge during the last glacial period and the occurrence of evaporation from an isotopically depleted source sample ms collected from the lake has the heaviest isotope values at 5 58 δ18o and 66 9 δ2h which deviate significantly from the lmwl fig 7 as a result of intensive surface evapotranspiration different groundwater flow that recharges the lake can also be defined by isotopic signatures as these flows have different origins and evolutionary processes the majority of groundwater samples collected near the dang river channel and from the observation boreholes surrounding the lake are distributed between the two lines approaching the position of the river water samples fig 7 collected from the main channel of the dang river except for sk3 all other groundwater samples from the observation boreholes surrounding the lake plot on the lower left of the lmwl fig 7 observation borehole jd19 located to south of the lake has a depth of 153 m compared to the other observation boreholes the δ2h and δ18o values of jd19 are the most depleted and plot on the lower left of the lmwl fig 7 suggesting a different source than the other observation boreholes sk4 is located on the south bank of the lake fig 2 and has a depth of 70 m the sk4 water sample plot above and right of sample jd19 in fig 7 with similar approximate δ2h and δ18o values to jd19 observation boreholes sk1 380 m deep and sk2 150 m deep are located in the southeast and northwest corners of the lake respectively fig 2 with enriched 2h and 18o contents beyond those of sk4 samples from g13 g15 and g16 plot above the lmwl with more enriched 2h and 18o contents than sk group samples compared to samples from other observation boreholes sk4 and jd19 are more depleted and shifted in their position along the gmwl towards more negative values therefore their recharge sources can be distinguished from runoff seepage from the dang river based on differences in the isotopic ratios from southwest to northeast the 2h and 18o signatures in groundwater samples around the lake tend to be gradually enriched further indicating the direction of groundwater flow combined with the discussion above it can be inferred that the lake receives contributions from at least two different aquifers one recharge source is shallow aquifers recharged by river water infiltration and the other is deep aquifers fed by the faults to the south of the lake groundwater samples from the downstream irrigation area are distributed near the lmwl fig 7 indicating the same precipitation recharge origin as other groundwater the majority of the groundwater samples collected from the downstream irrigation area and nearby lake as well as the dang river channel near the piedmont have similar isotopic compositions a drasticnegativeshiftofin 18o occurred in the groundwater from the downstream irrigation area which can be attributed to river water from the upper reaches of dang river most samples fall above the lmwl with elevated δ2h values indicating infiltrationrechargefrom the dang river and the effects of evapotranspiration this situation often occurs in dry climates or closed basins and reflects the nonequilibrium fractionation process of hydrogen and oxygen isotopes in the water cycle clark and fritz 1997 samples from dh31 and dh09 from near the river channel fig 7 fell below the gmwl with increased δ18o values which could be attributed to leakage recharge of deep bedrock aquifers thedang riveroriginatesinthesouth shule mountains to the west of the qilian mountains where carbonate aquifers occur as themajorstrata a positive 18o shift could occur at lower temperatures in carbonate aquifers but generally does not occur in non carbonate bedrock strata wang 1991 in the carbonate bedrock aquifers below the positive 18o shift occurs due to 18o exchange between cac16o2 18o in the rock and h2 16o in the groundwater equilibrium fractionation according to cac16o2 18o h2 16o cac16o3 h2 18o which elevates the concentration of 18o in the groundwater overall the majority of samples plot near the right end of the river water evaporation line δ2h 4 7δ18o 21 2 fig 7 suggesting the recharge source is seepage from the dang river seepage from the dang river runoff amounts to 43 106 m3a 1 over a distance of 20 km from the river outlet ma et al 2013 this must provide significant recharge to the dunhuang oasis δ18o and δ2h values of samples dj19 and sk4 are greatly depleted and close to those of samples dh01 and dh03 collected from tributaries of the dang river reflecting the effect of higher altitude and groundwater runoff mainly from the piedmont in addition a large area of naked carbonate strata limestone layers exists on the top of the qilian mountains meltwater from the qilian mountains infiltrates into the deep aquifers passes through the karst strata or large faults and directly recharges the dang river and its downstream areas via the faults below chen et al 2003 the deep semi confined sedimentary aquifers and bedrock aquifers in the dunhuang basin may partly originate from lateral recharge of ancient precipitation and groundwater flow through the piedmont fault zone yao et al 2001 therefore in addition to seepage from the dang river is recharge from piedmont groundwater runoff in summary the shallow unconfined sedimentary aquifers in the study region should be mainly recharged by leakage from the dang river including glacial meltwater while the deep confined aquifers are recharged by deep bedrock groundwater through basement faults beneath the piedmont of the qilian mountains and the dang river basin 4 2 3 recharge altitude and mixing ratios of different sources the dang river originates from glaciers on the south shule hills where the altitude of the snow line is 4640 5070 m a s l the annual runoffof the dang river is about 3 02 108 m3 zhao et al 2015 the recharge amount from glacier meltwater is estimated at 1 2302 108 m3 y which accounts for 34 9 of the total annual runoff of the dang river zhang 2008 based on the discussion above and the extreme arid climate it can be concluded that the surface water and groundwater in the study area are mainly recharged by precipitation glacier meltwater spring water and groundwater from the north side of the western qilian mountains although evaporation and water rock interactions have certain impacts on the stable isotopic composition the recharge elevation of river water and groundwater can be approximately estimated for the purposes of comparison for example groundwater in downstream areas such as the badain jaran desert is recharged by precipitation in the qilian mountain with the average recharge elevation being 3300 m chen et al 2003 based on the stable δ2h and δ18o isotopes of precipitation in northwestern china huang et al 2008 derived an equation 18o 0 0024 alt 4 98 alt elevation m that relates recharge elevation to isotope composition based on the δ18o content of dang river water the altitude of the recharge area in the dang river basin is estimated to range from 1820 to 2570 m with the average above 2130 m table 1 the recharge elevation of the upstream tributaries samples dh01 and dh03 of the dang river are approximately 2950 and 3230 m respectively and of the main channel dh05 is around 2490 m the average recharge altitude of groundwater in lower reaches of the dang river is about 2100 m the recharge elevation of groundwater from observation borehole dj19 which is located south of the lake is 2570 m and for sk2 which is located west of the lake is 2350 m table 1 the recharge elevation of sk4 is between dj19 and sk2 because it is affected by these points along the groundwater flow path sk3 is only about 3 m away from the lake and so is affected greatly by the lake water but the recharge elevations of the other observations boreholes sk1 g16 g15 and g13 are similar the recharge elevation of lake water and groundwater from boreholes around the lake range quite considerably suggesting different recharge sources mixing fractions can be calculated from three solute and isotope mass balance equations in this case the hydrochemical characteristics of sample sk1 collected 189 6 m downstream of the lake are very similar to those of the lake water therefore sample sk1 can be substituted for lake water that has not experienced strong evaporation δ18o and δ2h values of sample dj19 are greatly depleted and close to those of samples dh01 and dh03 collected from tributaries of the dang river reflecting its piedmont groundwater runoff source dh05 is located in the main channel of the dang river here samples dj19 and dh05 represent deep groundwater and dang river water respectively the components of samples representing the three recharge sources are shown in table 3 the solutes can be expressed in any concentration units and verified with other components represented here as simply the concentrations of δ2h and tds the modeling results show that f1 43 1 f2 22 3 and f3 34 6 in other words the recharge contributions of influent water from the dang river and deep groundwater are about 43 and 22 respectively and artificial recharge water accounts for the remaining 35 4 2 4 groundwater age modern groundwater is generally more susceptible to contamination than older groundwater due to the introduction of anthropogenic contaminants plummer and friedman 1999 thus high 3h signatures in groundwater can be interpreted as the result of mixing between older groundwater and recent additions han et al 2017 matsumoto et al 2017 based on the 3h value of precipitationcalculated from lop nur tarim basin xinjiang jiao et al 2004 about 500 km from the study area the 3h concentration of precipitation water in 1952 was 10 t u and increased to a maximum of 2586 t u in 1963 due to nuclear experiments carried out in the 1950 s and early 1960 s the 3h concentration of precipitation decreased gradually to 49 5 t u in 1996 with thedecay of 3h based on 3h analyses in ejina basin northwestern china the groundwater ages of different aquifers are thought to range from sub modern 1950 s to less than 5 years wen et al 2005 similarly wen et al 2008 recorded 3h values in zhangye basin northwestern china varying from 21 55 to 36 62 t u for shallow groundwater depth less than 30 m from 13 57 to 27 36 t u in groundwater from depths of 30 50 m from 10 11 to 16 76 t u in groundwater from depths of 50 100 m and from 3 13 to 5 91 t u in groundwater from deeper than 100 m the 3h content in 18 water samples collected from the study area varies from 11 to 40 t u comparing these results with the groundwater age estimated by 3h values given by zouari et al 2003 indicates a few samples 16 7 reflect radioactive decay 11 14 t u and are a mixture of pre modern water and newer modern water recharge or recent additions table 1 the majority of 3h values of groundwater samples 72 2 range from 18 to 30 t u indicating the groundwater is modern with a small contribution from water originating from the 1960 s to 1970 s due to the extreme aridity in the region groundwater receivesminimal direct contributions from modern rainfall and is mainly recharged by irrigation water diverted from the dang river therefore the groundwater may be primarilyrecharged by modern precipitation with a small fraction being pre modern and older than 60 years of age usually natural 3h in precipitation varies from 1 t u in oceanic high precipitation regions to as high as 10 t u in arid inland areas ravikumar and somashekar 2011 the 3h content of most groundwater samples from the study area is clearly different from recent rainfall between 1 and 10 t u suggesting the major source of recharge is modern rainfall with a short residence time in the subsurface among the observation boreholes the 3h value of groundwater sample sk2 150 m deep located to the northwest of the lake is only 11 t u in contrast the 3h values of groundwater samples sk1 380 m deep and g15 380 m deep located to the southeast and north of the lake are up to 20 and 30 t u respectively therefore the groundwater age gradually increases from the southwest to the northeast of the lake along the direction of groundwater flow in addition the 3h value of sample sk2 which is from the closestborehole to the lake is lower than samples from sk1 and g15 probably reflecting its relatively older recharge source 4 3 hydrogeological conceptual model and evolution of the lake the lake owes its existence to a unique combination of hydrogeological conditions landforms and wind directions the sediments beneath the lake and the alluvial plain to the northwest were deposited during the same period from the late pleistocene to holocene jia and cheng 2006 groundwater flow in the lake area is mainly affected by the recharge source aquifer permeability hydraulic gradient and topography groundwater flow direction in the lake area is basically the same as the dang river from southwest to northeast however the location of the lake is close to the piedmont zone and deviates from the main channel of the dang river with a slow groundwater flow rate 6 43 m d due to the low hydraulic gradient 2 li et al 2013 the low lying terrain and thick sand aquifers are the basic conditions for the formation of the lake with the higher regional groundwater level a primary reason for its existence fig 8 and maintenance for thousands of years localwinds were also important for the genesis of the lake the nearby dunes are 100 200 m high encircling the lake from the north east and west southerlies and northerlies are the dominant winds that cause sand slides into the lake the dunes surrounding the spring channel the regional winds into an east west oriented valley such that the moving sand is blown uphill and over the dune crest jiao 2010 as a result the lake has never been smothered by the shifting sand mountains around it and has existed for at least thousands of years in the same location the formation of the lake cannot be attributed to the faults in the piedmont zone as discussed above the hydrochemical and isotopic data indicate groundwater recharge from deep bedrock aquifers to the south of the lake onlyaccounts for a smallproportionof recharge to the lake and cannot support a groundwater level higher than that of regional groundwater in the lake area therefore the lake cannot be derived from groundwater in bedrock fractures based on the analysis above it can be inferred that hydrogeologically the lake is not a spring but a window of the groundwater table cut out of low lying terrain fig 8 the arid climate strong evaporation and sand deposition may be causes for the decline of the lake water level but the construction of the dang river reservoir seepage canals and excessiveexploitation of groundwater are the major reasons not only for the attenuation of the regional groundwater level but also for the ecological crisis in the lake area in the past three decades rapid urbanization and the expansion of agriculture in dunhuang city placed great pressure on the region s natural water resources with more than 2000 new wells drilled from 1997 to 2007 leading to excessive withdrawal of groundwater and a rapid fall in groundwater level the shrinking of the lake was largely caused by reduced river water recharge due to the construction of the upstream dang river reservoir anti seepage treatment of irrigation canals and excessive exploitation of groundwater to meet the needs of an increasing population and agricultural activities artificial recharge conducted by injecting freshwater into the artificial aquifers around the lake began in 2008 the total recharge rate of the artificial aquifer is 7000 m3 d to maintain the designated water depth of 0 3 1 m in the lake as a result of this artificial recharge project and management measures the lake level has been maintained at a depth of around 1 2 m for the past 10 years however the trend of groundwater level decrease in the dunhuang basin has not yet been reversed the artificial recharge project can only elevate the local water table in the immediate vicinity of the lake if the regional groundwater table continues to fall due to excessive groundwater extraction in the dunhuang basin the artificial recharge project may fail to maintain the current water level in the lake if so this lake that represents a marvelous spectacle of nature and survived for thousands of years in the gobi desert may disappear forever as a result of overuse of groundwater in the last 60 years realizing such a high risk of disappearance of the lake the chinese government implemented a strategic plan for water resources rational utilization and ecological protection in 2011 this plan calls for 88 million m3 a of river water to be diverted to the dunhuang city of which 40 million m3 is to be used for rehabilitation of the lake gansu water management bureau 2011 sustainable urbanization needs to redress the degradation of land and water future work should be based on an evaluation of the carrying capacity of water resources and potential recharge to the local aquifer system 5 conclusions hydrochemical and isotopic tracers were used to understand the recharge sources and hydrogeochemical evolution of groundwater in the study area from the upper reaches of the dang river to the downstream irrigation area the concentrations of tds components in groundwater tended toincreasealong the flow path with changes in hydrochemical water type the hydrochemical features of the lake water and groundwater samples collected from the observation boreholes were similar to those of groundwater samples near the dang river channel the paleo channel of the dang river has considerableeffectsnot only on the sedimentary environment of the lake but also on the groundwater hydrochemistry a gradual enrichment in stable isotopes was observed along the regional groundwater flow path although the calculated recharge altitude indicates a water supply from deep aquifers to the south of the lake characteristic δ2h and δ18o compositions confirmed the shallow unconfined sedimentary aquifers and the lake are mainly recharged by leakage from the dang river while deep confined aquifers are recharged by deep lateral groundwater flow via the fault zones in the piedmont of the qilian mountains the 3h content in water samples collected from the study area varied from 11 to 40 t u which indicates modern precipitation is the primary recharge source of groundwater with pre modern older than about 60 years in age precipitation accounting for only a small fraction of groundwater recharge the lake is a window into the groundwater table that has been cut out of low lying terrain in the sand dunes the results of modeling using cl and δ18o data showed the recharge ratios of influentwater from the dang river and deep groundwater are about 43 and 22 respectively with artificial recharge into the aquifer around the lake accounting for the remaining 35 although the regional hydrogeological conditions arid climate and sand deposition have negative influences on the size of the lake the regional groundwater table decline is primarily a consequence of the attenuation of groundwater recharge which was caused by the construction of dang river reservoir seepage of drainage canals and excessiveexploitation of groundwater integrated approaches of sustainable water resource management are urgently needed to save the lake a world class unique natural heritage site author contributions chunli su wrote the

5982,the crescent moon spring is a unique scenic spot located in an aeolian sand environment of northwestern china the water level of this spring has continuously declined in recent decades causing both the government and many scholars great concern to better understand its hydrologic structure this study investigated the origin of the spring and its recharge sources based on the hydrochemical and isotopic 18o 2h and 3h composition of 56 water samples collected along the groundwater flow path the results indicate the spring is a window into the groundwater table cut out of low lying terrain in sand dunes with the geographic and sedimentary conditions affecting its genesis and hydrochemistry the spring and shallow sedimentary aquifers are recharged primarilyby river water while deep bedrock aquifers are recharged by deep lateral groundwater flow via fault zones in the piedmont of the qilian mountains the results of recharge altitude calculations demonstrate a possible groundwater supply from deep bedrock aquifers to the south of spring the recorded environmental 3h content varied from 11 to 40 t u indicating the groundwater is primarilyrecharged by glacier meltwater from modern precipitation with only a small fraction from pre modern times end member analysis using cl and δ18o shows recharge ratios of influentwater from the dang river and deep groundwater represent about 43 and 22 of the lake water respectively with artificial recharge accounting for the remaining 35 regional hydrogeological conditions arid climate and sand deposition have negative influences on the maintenance of lake water levels but observed regional groundwater level declines resulting from the construction of the dang river reservoir seepage from drainage canals and excessiveexploitation of groundwater are the most important factors contributing to the ecological crisis in the study area these results provide insights into the origin and recharge sources of the crescent moon spring that will guide efforts to preserve the water level keywords groundwater recharge sources hydrochemistry isotopic evidence crescent moon spring 1 introduction crescent moon spring 94 40 09 99 e 40 05 11 98 n is a natural heritage site and has been a world class tourist destination in a desert oasis for more than 1000 years it is located about 6 km south of dunhuang city gansu province northwest china fig 1 the name crescent moon spring is derived from its resemblance to a crescent moon as it is exposed as a crescent shaped lake hereafter referred to as the lake that has existed for more 2000 years countless tourists are attracted to the site due to its reputation as a miraculous and scenic spot however the lake s water level has been falling over the past 60 years with its area noticeably shrinking its maximum width decreased from 90 m in 1955 to 35 m in 2007 during which time the average water depth decreased by approximately 0 12 m y li et al 2014 the water level was about 1134 m above sea level in 2010 the area of the lake in the 1950 s was 14 650 m2 and its average depth was 5 m with a maximum depth of 7 5 m huang and wu 1993 but beginninginthe 1980 s lake water was directly pumped to irrigate nearby farmland for several years as a result of excessive pumping the water level dropped sharply and the steep south and north banks collapsed which resulted in huge amounts of silt deposited on the lake bottom the average depth of the lake was less than 1 0 m in 1980 li 1998 and from 1987 to 1997 the area of the lake shrank from 9000 to 5667 m2 and the maximum water depth dropped from 4 2 to 2 m the worst situation occurred in 2001 when the maximum depth was only 0 18 m and the lake was essentially bottom up sangjimeiduo 2005 overthepastthreedecades the increase in agriculture and tourism decline in regional groundwater levels and degradation of the ecological environment on the alluvial plain of the dunhuang basin have become a concern for the sustainable development of the local society and economy the shrinking of the lake was of particular concern and led to an urgent requirement to identify the origin and recharge sources of the lake farmland area increased from 106 km2 in 1950 to 278 km2 in 2007 in the dunhuang region yi et al 2010 before the 1960s water from the dang river was used mostly for drinking and partly for irrigation but irrigation increased rapidly after the river was dammed in 1975 because the dang river reservoir did not provide enough water for the fast expanding population and agricultural activities groundwater supplies were tapped with deep wells the number of irrigation wells increased from only about 400 in 1971 to 1134 in 1997 and to 3179 in 2007 the annual groundwater exploitation in dunhuang city was 31 300 000 m3 in 1977 and increased to 58 830 000 m3 in 1999 and to more than 130 840 000 m3 in 2007 yi et al 2010 as a result of over exploitation the regional groundwater table has fallen by more than 10 m sangjimeiduo 2005 with the rate decreasing by as much as 0 3 0 4 m y since the 1960 s understanding the natural recharge conditions of the lake is important for establishing a new and sustainable water resource management approach in the region crescent moon spring is an incredible natural phenomenon that owes its existence to a unique combination of hydrogeological conditions landforms environment and wind directions however the formation of the lake remains to be fully understood water level changes in the lake reflect temporal variation in groundwater recharge which is affected not only by hydrogeological conditions precipitation dune altitude and geomorphologic features winter 1986 cao et al 2010 townley and trefry 2000 zlotnik et al 2007 but also intensive anthropogenic activities in this arid region determining groundwater recharge sources is difficult using conventional water balance and or hydraulics methods wang et al 2015 compared to traditional hydrological methods methodologies based on the use of environmental tracers have intrinsic advantages and provide a more promising approach for understanding hydrological systems ranging from small local catchment areas to large regional basins cook and herczeg 2012 matsumoto et al 2017 integrated hydrogeochemical and isotopic studies can be helpful for elucidating recharge sources water rock interactions and hydrogeochemical evolutional processes of natural water bodies ravikumar and somashekar 2011 ma and edmunds 2006 bouchaou et al 2008 vanderzalm et al 2011 diaw et al 2012 these techniques can also be used to identify recharge sources of groundwater estimate the contribution of each member and determine connections between surface and groundwater systems edmunds and tyler 2002 eissa et al 2014 wang et al 2015 in addition in the context of land use changes population growth and climate change the replenishment rate estimated from groundwater age on short time scales can provide very important information for water resource management matsumoto et al 2017 tritium 3h concentration can be used to qualitatively determine whether groundwater is modern although it alone cannot generally be used to quantitatively date groundwater clark and fritz 1997 han et al 2017 matsumoto et al 2017 for example groundwater with 3h concentrations below 3 t u is considered to be least 60 years old pre modern above 3 and less than 20 t u was recharged by local precipitation from 1954 to 1961 and greater than 20 t u is modern zouari et al 2003 ravikumar and somashekar 2011 classified modern groundwater age according to 3h values with values from 1 to 8 t u attributed to a mixture of recent water with old groundwater and groundwater having been subjected to radioactive decay in the most recent two decades many efforts have been made to prevent the lake from disappearing the local government banned land reclamation for cultivation prohibited the drilling of new wells and adopted efficient water saving irrigation practices gansu water management bureau 2011 although these water resource management measures have helped the lake water level continued to fall and in 2008 the local government decided to implement an artificial aquifer recharge project that aimed to maintain and even restore the water level effectively restoring the water level will require a better understanding of the origin and recharge sources of the lake precipitation was found to have an insignificant effect on the lake while contributions from at least two aquifers as well as groundwater flow direction were identified using hydraulic gradient and isotope analysis methods li et al 2014 the influences of the strata sedimentary environment and hydrochemistry on the origin of crescent moon spring lake have also been investigated li et al 2013 however the formation of the lake and recharge proportion from different water sources are still not well understood the objective of this study was to identify and characterize the origin and recharge sources of crescent moon spring lake by integrating isotope 2h 18o and 3h chemistry with hydrogeological and hydrochemical data the approaches and results confirm the formation mechanism and reasons for the shrinking of the lake and provide useful methodology and clues for similar studies in other arid regions 2 geological and hydrogeological setting crescent moon spring is located north of a semi closed low lying depression that is surrounded by the mingsha mountains the chinese word mingsha means singing sand with an exit to the east of the lake the depression is about 500 m long east west and about 290 m wide the mingsha mountains are composed of a series of giant sand dunes in the kumtag desert that stand more than 100 m above the water level of crescent mood spring lake and are aeolian deposits overlying alluvial fans fig 1 geomorphologically the lake is located in the oasis in the southern dunhuang basin that is bounded by the mingsha and sanwei mountains to the southeast and the mazong mountains to the north spreading into the gobi desert to the west fig 1 the dunhuang basin has a drainage area of 6290 8 km2 the oasis covers an area of 1400 km2 and consists of two major irrigation districts that have a total irrigation area of 298 km2 and an irrigation history that spans thousands of years the nanhu irrigation district about 60 km southwest of dunhuang spreads from the sanwei mountains in the southeast to the gobi desert in the northwest with an altitude ranging between 1150 and 1200 m a s l some spring fed reservoirs are distributed throughout this district the dunhuang irrigation district at an elevation ranging from 800 to 1500 m a s l stretches from the southwestern mingsha mountains to the northeastern xihu wetland reserve fig 1 the thick quaternary aquifers in the duanghuang basin are comprised of diluvial and alluvial sediments and some aeolian and lacustrine deposits the basement rocks consist of conglomerate argillaceous sandstone and muddy siltstone that formed during the tertiary period and these materials were cemented by calcareous mud unconfined and semi confined aquifers are made up of unconsolidated quaternary sediments that are hundreds of meters thick they were deposited in the southern foreland and tens of meters from the edge of the basin in the western part of the dunhuang irrigation district the alluvial diluvial aquifers consist of highly permeable cobbles gravels and sands ranging from 200 to 400 m in thickness ma et al 2013 the piezometric level of groundwater ranges from 10 to 50 m deep gansu geology survey 1978 at the northern and eastern edges of the alluvial fans the aquifer comprises inter bedded fine sands and clays and becomes semi confined or confined with piezometric levels of less than 3 m gansu geology survey 1978 in some low lying places groundwater emerges to form puddles due to the shallow groundwater levels at the edges of the alluvial fans groundwater is lost rapidly to the intense evaporation in the region the overall direction of groundwater flow is from the southeast to the northwest ma et al 2013 the geological conditions show crescent moon spring lies in a low lying depression between two alluvial fans one deposited by the dang river some 4 5 km to the west and the other deposited by the xishui river some 6 5 km to the east fig 1b the depression is about 500 m long in e w orientation and about 290 m wide the topography of the lake indicates it is a feature on the upper part of the dang river alluvial pluvial fan lying adjacentto the paleo channel of the dang river and surrounded by grand sand dunes with an exit to the east of the lake fig 2 to the south of the lake the mingsha mountains sand dunes develop while alluvial plains spread to the north fig 1b the lake region is composed of a thick sandy layer holocene alluvial lacustrine deposits muddy silt about 10 m thick formed 11 000 years ago with rich plant roots and snail shells a middle and early pleistocene alluvial pluvial layer approximately 250 m thick with double sectors the upper sector is predominantly medium coarse sands and the lower sector is mainly fine sand and clamping clay sand and late pleistocene alluvial lacustrine sandstone and clay interlayers with fossils jia and cheng 2006 the neogene layer is mainly alluvial lacustrine pelitic sandstone siltstone and pelitic siltstone which occur throughout the basin and at a depth of more than 380 m in the lake region the particle size of sediment tends to be fine from the north to the south of the basin the bedrock of the basin is a pre sinian system which is mainly granite geneiss amphibolite diopite quartz schist and marble with a total thickness of more than 4600 m based on geophysical exploration the depth to the bedrock is more than 600 m in the lake region geo environmental monitoring institute of gansu province 2008 two groups of faults are distributed to the south of lake in the ne sw and e w directions respectively the nearest e w fault is located about 1 km from the lake the ne sw compression and scissor faults are well developed in the piedmont zone of the sanwei and mingsha mountains with the direction consistent with the trend of the sanwei mountains they stretch long and deep occur as the borders of mountains and plains and played an important role in the deposition of thick sediments in the basin the e w tenso shear fractures belong to the second grade fault and its extension length is less than the former geo environmental monitoring institute of gansu province 2008 the surface water in the study area consists of the dang river xishui river and other intermittent streams that flow after storms the dang river originates from the western qilian mountains and is a 390 km long independent drainage system with a catchment area of 1 697 104 km2 zhao et al 2015 it is recharged by precipitation glacier meltwater and groundwater from the qilian mountains where a deep groundwater flow system has developed especially in carbonate aquifers in the dunhuang basin the dang river flows along a channel approximately 60 km long fig 1b and is believed to be the mother river of the dunhuang oasis the surface water in the dunhuang oasis is primarily from the dang river reservoir which was built in 1975 at the southern end of the dunhuang basin and has since been a significant barrier to surface flow into the dunhuang basin ma et al 2013 the study area has a typical continental arid climate with extremely cold winters and hot summers the average annual rainfall is less than 40 mm whereas the annual potential evaporation is up to 2488 mm most rainfall occurs during the east asian summer monsoon season from may to august synchronous with the evaporation peak fig 3 a the monthly mean temperature ranges from 10 5 to 24 7 c fig 3b with a diurnal temperature range of up to 30 c over 3200 h of sunshine occur throughout the year the relative humidity is less than 50 as a result of being landlocked with the ground mainly covered by the gobi desert and sand dunes the study area is obviously characterized by an extreme arid climate rather low rainfall and high evaporation a large temperature difference between day and night long hours of sunshine abundant sand and water source shortages due to the sparse and highly variable rainfall runoff from the surrounding mountains produces no perennial streams that reach the basin only during the occasional year does short term surface flow or shallow groundwater recharge occurs as a result of elevated rainfall therefore most rainfall recharge is limited to the ground surface and makes no contribution to the deeper aquifers 3 material and methods 3 1 sampling procedures and analytical methods twelve observation boreholes have been drilled and are distributed around the lake sk1 sk2 sk3 sk4 sk5 and dj19 and near the side of the oasis g11 g12 g13 g14 g15 and g16 fig 2 they are used to monitor groundwater levels and hydrochemical components as well as the hydrogen and oxygen isotopic composition in the groundwater around the lake all of the observation boreholes are screened with short filters which are installed to monitor the aquifers at specified depths water samples were also collected from the lake rivers and other wells in the study area no long screened wells were sampled to avoid artificial mixing which may impair a correct geochemical characterization of the aquifer to obtain sufficient hydrochemical data field work was carried out in november 2009 and june 2010 a total of 20 representative samples fig 1 and table 1 were collected in november 2009 including four surface water samples and 16 groundwater samples surface water samples were collected from the dang river reservoir the middle reach of the dang river main channel the lower reach of the xishui river and crescent moon springs lake the set of 16 groundwater samples was gathered from the observation boreholes as well as water supply and irrigation wells within the quaternary aquifer across the study area in addition a total of 36 representative samples were collected in june 2010 including seven surface water samples collected from the dang river reservoir 1 sample the main channel of the dang river 5 samples from the upper to lower reaches crescent moon springs lake 1 sample and 29 groundwater samples from the observation boreholes as well as water supply and irrigation wells fig 1 prior to sampling all observation boreholes and wells were pumped continuously for more than 15 min to remove stagnant water samples were filtered on site using 0 45 μm membrane filters and stored in three pre cleaned 250 ml low density polyethylene ldpe bottles for subsequent analyses sub samples for cation analyses were acidified to ph 2 by addition of ultrapure 6 mol l hno3 to stabilize the metals two sub samples

groundwater samples were measured by isotope ratio mass spectrometry mat 251 the precision of δ2h and δ18o measurements was 1 and 0 1 2σ criterion respectively the 3h content of 17 groundwater samples was measured using a quantulus 1220 liquid scintillation counter preceded by electrolytic enrichment the precision of 3h measurements was 0 5 t u 3σ criterion where 1 t u is 1 atom of 3h in 1018 atoms of hydrogen all analyses were undertaken in the state key laboratory of biogeology and environmental geology china university of geoscience in wuhan major ions and isotopes were analyzed within 2 weeks of sampling analytical precision and accuracy were estimated as better than 5 on the basis of repeated analyses of samples and standard solutions ionic charge balance errors ibe were computed on the basis of ions expressed in meq l with the value of ibe within a limit of 5 3 2 linear end member mixing model a linear end member mixing model clark 2015 han et al 2017 was combined with hydrogeological analysis in this study to quantify the groundwater contribution to the lake and the mixing ratios among various water sources in the case of three end members calculating mixing ratios is possible but requires a second conservative parameter to solve the mixing equations clark 2015 in the present work three mass balance equations are considered the first and second are mass balance

processes the hydrochemistry of groundwater systems can be greatly affected by topography geology lithology hydrology and climate su and wang 2013 to compare the hydrochemical characteristics of different water bodies in the study area the samples were divided into seven categories from recharge area to discharge area surface water including dang river dang river reservoir and xishui river

with an average of 8 3 table 1 along the dang river from the qingshuigou tributary upstream to the dang river reservoir the total dissolved solids tds gradually increase with the exception of sample dh03 which was sampled from an upstream tributary of the dang river and has a relative lower tds value 136 1 mg l all other samples have tds values ranging from 218 8 to 367 8 mg l average 271 3 mg l table 1 the ph and tds of water samples collected from the dang river reservoir dh07 and ms 01 have values similar to those of river water samples the major ions in water from the dang river and dang river reservoir are hco3 so4 2 ca2 and mg2 fig 4 concentrations of the major ions show similar trends to tds values the xishui river is located in the eastern portion of the study area fig 1b sample xsg03 collected from the xishui river reflects cl hco3 na mg type water fig 4 with a ph of 8 0 the ph of this sample is lower than samples of dang river water while its tds value 1234 mg l is significantly higher than the average for dang river water 271 3 mg l table 1 and fig 4 overall the hydrochemical characteristics of sample xsg03 collected from the xishui river are distinctly different from samples taken from the dang river furthermore a durov diagram shows the composition and water type of dang river water samples are very similar to groundwater samples collected from the nearby dang river channel fig 4 see also table 1 based on the above discussion the recharge source of the groundwater upstream of the lake is thought to be the dang river rather than the xishui river 4 1 1 2 lake water and groundwater around the lake ph values of samples collected from the lake and the observation boreholes range from 7 2 to 9 3 table 1 and fig 4 the ph of samples from closer to the lake range from 8 5 to 9 3 and are higher than samples taken further from the lake ph 7 to 7 95 the tds content of water from observation boreholes close to the lake sk1 sk5 and dj19 fig 2 is generally low ranging from 246 9 to 548 7 mg l across the two sampling campaigns table 1 and fig 4 average tds values of 373 7 mg l in june 2010 and 337 5 mg l in november 2009 are both lower than lake water samples taken at the same time 592 5 mg l in june 2010 and 722 4 mg l in november 2009 table 1 the tds content at the observation boreholes g11 g17 fig 2 far from the lake is comparatively high ranging from 767 6 to 1647 mg l in june 2010 table 1 and fig 4 the average tds values of 1135 mg l in june 2010 and 1150 mg l in november 2009 are both much higher than for lake water the lake experiences strong evaporation due to exposure to air the lake water samples collected in june 2010 and november 2009 reflect so4 hco3 cl mg ca na and so4 hco3 mg type water respectively fig 4 the groundwater collected from the observation boreholes around the lake is mainly hco3 cl mg na type while the majority of groundwater samples collected from group g observation boreholes far from the lake are hco3 mg type fig 4 the different hydrochemical characteristics between group sk and group g samples are mainly attributed to the influence of hydrogeological setting sedimentary environment and long term irrigation the group g observation boreholes are distributed in the inner triangle depression area between the dang river and xishuigou river alluvial diluvial fans as well as in the paleo channel of the dang river the sediment grains in the fan margin are fine which results in rather slow groundwater flow in addition the group g observation boreholes are distributed in the irrigation area which is planted with cotton and fruit trees due to the extreme drought in the region the agricultural activities heavily rely on river water and groundwater irrigation under the strong evaporation salt accumulates in the shallow sediments which leads to higher tds content in the shallow groundwater therefore the paleo geographical conditions and heterogeneous sedimentary environment are thought to have large impact on the groundwater hydrochemistry long term human activity accelerated this change 4 1 1 3 groundwater near the dang river channel and from the irrigation district a total of 19 water samples were collected from water supply wells distributed in the lower reaches of the dang river including one sample from the dang river alluvial fan six near the dang river channel downstream of the dang river reservoir and 12 from the downstream irrigation district fig 1a tds values of groundwater samples collected from near the dang river channel range from 406 1 to 945 5 mg l average 599 2 mg l but are twice as high in the downstream irrigation district north of the lake range 831 9 to 1758 mg l average 1294 mg l table 2 the hydrochemical types of groundwater samples collected from the downstream irrigation district are similar to groundwater near the river channel mainly so4 hco3 cl mg na and hco3 so4 mg na type waters fig 4 4 1 2 hydrochemical evolutional processes from the upper reaches of the dang river to the downstream irrigation district the hco3 concentration decreases gradually while so4 2 and cl concentrations increase with the rate of so4 2 concentration increase being greater than for cl fig 5 a the ca2 concentration gradually decreases while mg2 and na concentrations increase fig 5b therefore from the upper reaches of the dang river to the downstream irrigation district the hydrochemical type of water samples evolves from hco3 so4 ca mg dang river to hco3 so4 mg ca groundwater near dang river channel to hco3 so4 cl mg na ca groundwater around the lake to so4 hco3 cl mg na groundwater in the downstream irrigation district fig 4 generally from the recharge area upper reaches of the dang river to the discharge area downstream irrigation district the groundwater composition changes in space and time becoming more saline table 1 and table 2 the groundwater in the recharge area is dominated by hco3 ca mg type water with low tds while the groundwater in the drainage area is mostly so4 cl na type water with higher tds fig 4 the dominant anions change from hco3 to so4 2 to cl fig 5a and the dominant cations change from ca2 to mg2 to na fig 5b with a corresponding increase in tds fig 4 water types should be a reflection of flow paths mixing processes water rock interactions and evaporation processes su and wang 2013 which result in the change from hco3 ca to so4 cl na type water along the flow paths the hco3 ca type waters generally occur in recharge areas with higher elevation while the cl na type waters occur in low lying discharge areas the intermediate water types result from mixing and hydrogeochemical processes between these two end members adams et al 2001 hco3 ca type waters are primarily formed by the dissolution of carbonate minerals where surface water charged with atmospheric and biogenic co2 percolatesthrough soil into the groundwater adams et al 2001 along the flow path of the groundwater the concentration of na increases due to strong evaporation and na ca ion exchange while the concentration of ca2 tends to decrease due to the solubility control of calcite through the precipitation of carbonate minerals in addition to evaporation and oversaturation with respect to calcium carbonate that can cause a decrease of ca2 concentration in groundwater another possible consideration is differences in ion exchange capacity related to grain sizes in the aquifer matrix su and wang 2013 in the discharge area the downstream irrigation district the fine grain content of sediments increases so groundwater flows more slowly na adsorbed on the mineral surface is prone to exchange with groundwater ca2 and mg2 which results in increasing na concentration and decreasing ca2 and mg2 concentration therefore from the upper reaches of the dang river to the downstream irrigation district the concentrations of na and cl could be further enriched 4 2 recharge sources based on hydrogen and oxygen isotopes 4 2 1 distribution characteristics of stable isotopes the isotopic composition δ2h and δ18o of 42 representative samples of lake water river water and groundwater was analyzed table 1 along the regional groundwater flow path from southwest to northeast surface water is generally recharged by groundwater in the upper and middle reaches of the dang river although frequentinteraction occurs between groundwater and surface water in the lower reaches the river water recharges groundwater results of the stable isotope composition analyses indicate waters from the study area are isotopically fractionated due to evapotranspiration and recharge altitude effects a gradual enrichment in groundwater 18o concentration is observed along the regional groundwater flow path from the upper reaches of the dang river to groundwater in the irrigation area with a notable peak at the lake sample ms fig 6 the lake water has the highest δ18o value due to strong evaporation due to its exposure to air samples dj19 sk4 sk1 and sk2 from near the lake have obviously lower δ18o values relative to other groundwater samples from around the lake fig 6 probably due to differences in recharge sources 4 2 2 groundwater origin stable isotope δ2h and δ18o data were used to explore the origins of lake water and groundwater in the study area as shown in fig 7 water samples collected in june 2010 plot close to the global meteoric water line gmwl δ2h 8δ18o 10 and the local meteoric water line lmwl δ2h 7 51δ18o 0 81 zhao 2017 indicating these waters are directly derived from meteoric precipitation the lmwl was derived from 332 precipitation samples collected from the shule basin from june 2013 to july 2016 zhao 2017 the original δ2h δ18o relationship in the rainfall has obviously been altered by evaporation resulting in rather lower d values in the arid northwestern region of china positive shifts away from the meteoric lines are indicative of evapotranspiration fig 7 the long term isotope data for annualmean rainfall are from the dang river hydrological monitoring station which is located near the dang river reservoir the weighted mean δ18o and δ2h values of 81 precipitation samples collected from the dang river hydrological monitoring station are 7 47 and 56 92 respectively fig 7 zhao 2017 all of the river water and groundwater samples are strongly depleted compared to all of these values confirming that modern precipitation in the study area has a negligible impact on the groundwater both the river water and groundwater samples plotted along the two meteoric water lines indicating these samples are derived from meteoric water fig 7 the simultaneous decreases of δ18o and δ2h values in river water and groundwater samples reflect the effects of cooler climate in the past zhao et al 2015 and different recharge altitudes the dang river originates in the western qilian mountains with the elevation of the snow line at 4640 5070 m the depleted isotope values 12 0 δ18o and 80 0 δ2h in the upstream sections of the dang river are similar to those reported from the dunde ice core from the qinghai tibetan plateau thompson et al 1989 suggesting meltwater from the qilian mountains contributes to the steady runoff of the dang river ma et al 2013 except for sample dh04 collected from the middle reaches of the dang river which is located between the lmwl and gmwl other river water samples fall to the left of these lines samples dh01 and dh03 collected from upstream tributaries of the dang river lie on the lower left side of the gmwl with rather depleted δ2h and δ18o ratios fig 7 indicating their possible origin from high elevation montane recharge or paleo recharge during the last glacial period and the occurrence of evaporation from an isotopically depleted source sample ms collected from the lake has the heaviest isotope values at 5 58 δ18o and 66 9 δ2h which deviate significantly from the lmwl fig 7 as a result of intensive surface evapotranspiration different groundwater flow that recharges the lake can also be defined by isotopic signatures as these flows have different origins and evolutionary processes the majority of groundwater samples collected near the dang river channel and from the observation boreholes surrounding the lake are distributed between the two lines approaching the position of the river water samples fig 7 collected from the main channel of the dang river except for sk3 all other groundwater samples from the observation boreholes surrounding the lake plot on the lower left of the lmwl fig 7 observation borehole jd19 located to south of the lake has a depth of 153 m compared to the other observation boreholes the δ2h and δ18o values of jd19 are the most depleted and plot on the lower left of the lmwl fig 7 suggesting a different source than the other observation boreholes sk4 is located on the south bank of the lake fig 2 and has a depth of 70 m the sk4 water sample plot above and right of sample jd19 in fig 7 with similar approximate δ2h and δ18o values to jd19 observation boreholes sk1 380 m deep and sk2 150 m deep are located in the southeast and northwest corners of the lake respectively fig 2 with enriched 2h and 18o contents beyond those of sk4 samples from g13 g15 and g16 plot above the lmwl with more enriched 2h and 18o contents than sk group samples compared to samples from other observation boreholes sk4 and jd19 are more depleted and shifted in their position along the gmwl towards more negative values therefore their recharge sources can be distinguished from runoff seepage from the dang river based on differences in the isotopic ratios from southwest to northeast the 2h and 18o signatures in groundwater samples around the lake tend to be gradually enriched further indicating the direction of groundwater flow combined with the discussion above it can be inferred that the lake receives contributions from at least two different aquifers one recharge source is shallow aquifers recharged by river water infiltration and the other is deep aquifers fed by the faults to the south of the lake groundwater samples from the downstream irrigation area are distributed near the lmwl fig 7 indicating the same precipitation recharge origin as other groundwater the majority of the groundwater samples collected from the downstream irrigation area and nearby lake as well as the dang river channel near the piedmont have similar isotopic compositions a drasticnegativeshiftofin 18o occurred in the groundwater from the downstream irrigation area which can be attributed to river water from the upper reaches of dang river most samples fall above the lmwl with elevated δ2h values indicating infiltrationrechargefrom the dang river and the effects of evapotranspiration this situation often occurs in dry climates or closed basins and reflects the nonequilibrium fractionation process of hydrogen and oxygen isotopes in the water cycle clark and fritz 1997 samples from dh31 and dh09 from near the river channel fig 7 fell below the gmwl with increased δ18o values which could be attributed to leakage recharge of deep bedrock aquifers thedang riveroriginatesinthesouth shule mountains to the west of the qilian mountains where carbonate aquifers occur as themajorstrata a positive 18o shift could occur at lower temperatures in carbonate aquifers but generally does not occur in non carbonate bedrock strata wang 1991 in the carbonate bedrock aquifers below the positive 18o shift occurs due to 18o exchange between cac16o2 18o in the rock and h2 16o in the groundwater equilibrium fractionation according to cac16o2 18o h2 16o cac16o3 h2 18o which elevates the concentration of 18o in the groundwater overall the majority of samples plot near the right end of the river water evaporation line δ2h 4 7δ18o 21 2 fig 7 suggesting the recharge source is seepage from the dang river seepage from the dang river runoff amounts to 43 106 m3a 1 over a distance of 20 km from the river outlet ma et al 2013 this must provide significant recharge to the dunhuang oasis δ18o and δ2h values of samples dj19 and sk4 are greatly depleted and close to those of samples dh01 and dh03 collected from tributaries of the dang river reflecting the effect of higher altitude and groundwater runoff mainly from the piedmont in addition a large area of naked carbonate strata limestone layers exists on the top of the qilian mountains meltwater from the qilian mountains infiltrates into the deep aquifers passes through the karst strata or large faults and directly recharges the dang river and its downstream areas via the faults below chen et al 2003 the deep semi confined sedimentary aquifers and bedrock aquifers in the dunhuang basin may partly originate from lateral recharge of ancient precipitation and groundwater flow through the piedmont fault zone yao et al 2001 therefore in addition to seepage from the dang river is recharge from piedmont groundwater runoff in summary the shallow unconfined sedimentary aquifers in the study region should be mainly recharged by leakage from the dang river including glacial meltwater while the deep confined aquifers are recharged by deep bedrock groundwater through basement faults beneath the piedmont of the qilian mountains and the dang river basin 4 2 3 recharge altitude and mixing ratios of different sources the dang river originates from glaciers on the south shule hills where the altitude of the snow line is 4640 5070 m a s l the annual runoffof the dang river is about 3 02 108 m3 zhao et al 2015 the recharge amount from glacier meltwater is estimated at 1 2302 108 m3 y which accounts for 34 9 of the total annual runoff of the dang river zhang 2008 based on the discussion above and the extreme arid climate it can be concluded that the surface water and groundwater in the study area are mainly recharged by precipitation glacier meltwater spring water and groundwater from the north side of the western qilian mountains although evaporation and water rock interactions have certain impacts on the stable isotopic composition the recharge elevation of river water and groundwater can be approximately estimated for the purposes of comparison for example groundwater in downstream areas such as the badain jaran desert is recharged by precipitation in the qilian mountain with the average recharge elevation being 3300 m chen et al 2003 based on the stable δ2h and δ18o isotopes of precipitation in northwestern china huang et al 2008 derived an equation 18o 0 0024 alt 4 98 alt elevation m that relates recharge elevation to isotope composition based on the δ18o content of dang river water the altitude of the recharge area in the dang river basin is estimated to range from 1820 to 2570 m with the average above 2130 m table 1 the recharge elevation of the upstream tributaries samples dh01 and dh03 of the dang river are approximately 2950 and 3230 m respectively and of the main channel dh05 is around 2490 m the average recharge altitude of groundwater in lower reaches of the dang river is about 2100 m the recharge elevation of groundwater from observation borehole dj19 which is located south of the lake is 2570 m and for sk2 which is located west of the lake is 2350 m table 1 the recharge elevation of sk4 is between dj19 and sk2 because it is affected by these points along the groundwater flow path sk3 is only about 3 m away from the lake and so is affected greatly by the lake water but the recharge elevations of the other observations boreholes sk1 g16 g15 and g13 are similar the recharge elevation of lake water and groundwater from boreholes around the lake range quite considerably suggesting different recharge sources mixing fractions can be calculated from three solute and isotope mass balance equations in this case the hydrochemical characteristics of sample sk1 collected 189 6 m downstream of the lake are very similar to those of the lake water therefore sample sk1 can be substituted for lake water that has not experienced strong evaporation δ18o and δ2h values of sample dj19 are greatly depleted and close to those of samples dh01 and dh03 collected from tributaries of the dang river reflecting its piedmont groundwater runoff source dh05 is located in the main channel of the dang river here samples dj19 and dh05 represent deep groundwater and dang river water respectively the components of samples representing the three recharge sources are shown in table 3 the solutes can be expressed in any concentration units and verified with other components represented here as simply the concentrations of δ2h and tds the modeling results show that f1 43 1 f2 22 3 and f3 34 6 in other words the recharge contributions of influent water from the dang river and deep groundwater are about 43 and 22 respectively and artificial recharge water accounts for the remaining 35 4 2 4 groundwater age modern groundwater is generally more susceptible to contamination than older groundwater due to the introduction of anthropogenic contaminants plummer and friedman 1999 thus high 3h signatures in groundwater can be interpreted as the result of mixing between older groundwater and recent additions han et al 2017 matsumoto et al 2017 based on the 3h value of precipitationcalculated from lop nur tarim basin xinjiang jiao et al 2004 about 500 km from the study area the 3h concentration of precipitation water in 1952 was 10 t u and increased to a maximum of 2586 t u in 1963 due to nuclear experiments carried out in the 1950 s and early 1960 s the 3h concentration of precipitation decreased gradually to 49 5 t u in 1996 with thedecay of 3h based on 3h analyses in ejina basin northwestern china the groundwater ages of different aquifers are thought to range from sub modern 1950 s to less than 5 years wen et al 2005 similarly wen et al 2008 recorded 3h values in zhangye basin northwestern china varying from 21 55 to 36 62 t u for shallow groundwater depth less than 30 m from 13 57 to 27 36 t u in groundwater from depths of 30 50 m from 10 11 to 16 76 t u in groundwater from depths of 50 100 m and from 3 13 to 5 91 t u in groundwater from deeper than 100 m the 3h content in 18 water samples collected from the study area varies from 11 to 40 t u comparing these results with the groundwater age estimated by 3h values given by zouari et al 2003 indicates a few samples 16 7 reflect radioactive decay 11 14 t u and are a mixture of pre modern water and newer modern water recharge or recent additions table 1 the majority of 3h values of groundwater samples 72 2 range from 18 to 30 t u indicating the groundwater is modern with a small contribution from water originating from the 1960 s to 1970 s due to the extreme aridity in the region groundwater receivesminimal direct contributions from modern rainfall and is mainly recharged by irrigation water diverted from the dang river therefore the groundwater may be primarilyrecharged by modern precipitation with a small fraction being pre modern and older than 60 years of age usually natural 3h in precipitation varies from 1 t u in oceanic high precipitation regions to as high as 10 t u in arid inland areas ravikumar and somashekar 2011 the 3h content of most groundwater samples from the study area is clearly different from recent rainfall between 1 and 10 t u suggesting the major source of recharge is modern rainfall with a short residence time in the subsurface among the observation boreholes the 3h value of groundwater sample sk2 150 m deep located to the northwest of the lake is only 11 t u in contrast the 3h values of groundwater samples sk1 380 m deep and g15 380 m deep located to the southeast and north of the lake are up to 20 and 30 t u respectively therefore the groundwater age gradually increases from the southwest to the northeast of the lake along the direction of groundwater flow in addition the 3h value of sample sk2 which is from the closestborehole to the lake is lower than samples from sk1 and g15 probably reflecting its relatively older recharge source 4 3 hydrogeological conceptual model and evolution of the lake the lake owes its existence to a unique combination of hydrogeological conditions landforms and wind directions the sediments beneath the lake and the alluvial plain to the northwest were deposited during the same period from the late pleistocene to holocene jia and cheng 2006 groundwater flow in the lake area is mainly affected by the recharge source aquifer permeability hydraulic gradient and topography groundwater flow direction in the lake area is basically the same as the dang river from southwest to northeast however the location of the lake is close to the piedmont zone and deviates from the main channel of the dang river with a slow groundwater flow rate 6 43 m d due to the low hydraulic gradient 2 li et al 2013 the low lying terrain and thick sand aquifers are the basic conditions for the formation of the lake with the higher regional groundwater level a primary reason for its existence fig 8 and maintenance for thousands of years localwinds were also important for the genesis of the lake the nearby dunes are 100 200 m high encircling the lake from the north east and west southerlies and northerlies are the dominant winds that cause sand slides into the lake the dunes surrounding the spring channel the regional winds into an east west oriented valley such that the moving sand is blown uphill and over the dune crest jiao 2010 as a result the lake has never been smothered by the shifting sand mountains around it and has existed for at least thousands of years in the same location the formation of the lake cannot be attributed to the faults in the piedmont zone as discussed above the hydrochemical and isotopic data indicate groundwater recharge from deep bedrock aquifers to the south of the lake onlyaccounts for a smallproportionof recharge to the lake and cannot support a groundwater level higher than that of regional groundwater in the lake area therefore the lake cannot be derived from groundwater in bedrock fractures based on the analysis above it can be inferred that hydrogeologically the lake is not a spring but a window of the groundwater table cut out of low lying terrain fig 8 the arid climate strong evaporation and sand deposition may be causes for the decline of the lake water level but the construction of the dang river reservoir seepage canals and excessiveexploitation of groundwater are the major reasons not only for the attenuation of the regional groundwater level but also for the ecological crisis in the lake area in the past three decades rapid urbanization and the expansion of agriculture in dunhuang city placed great pressure on the region s natural water resources with more than 2000 new wells drilled from 1997 to 2007 leading to excessive withdrawal of groundwater and a rapid fall in groundwater level the shrinking of the lake was largely caused by reduced river water recharge due to the construction of the upstream dang river reservoir anti seepage treatment of irrigation canals and excessive exploitation of groundwater to meet the needs of an increasing population and agricultural activities artificial recharge conducted by injecting freshwater into the artificial aquifers around the lake began in 2008 the total recharge rate of the artificial aquifer is 7000 m3 d to maintain the designated water depth of 0 3 1 m in the lake as a result of this artificial recharge project and management measures the lake level has been maintained at a depth of around 1 2 m for the past 10 years however the trend of groundwater level decrease in the dunhuang basin has not yet been reversed the artificial recharge project can only elevate the local water table in the immediate vicinity of the lake if the regional groundwater table continues to fall due to excessive groundwater extraction in the dunhuang basin the artificial recharge project may fail to maintain the current water level in the lake if so this lake that represents a marvelous spectacle of nature and survived for thousands of years in the gobi desert may disappear forever as a result of overuse of groundwater in the last 60 years realizing such a high risk of disappearance of the lake the chinese government implemented a strategic plan for water resources rational utilization and ecological protection in 2011 this plan calls for 88 million m3 a of river water to be diverted to the dunhuang city of which 40 million m3 is to be used for rehabilitation of the lake gansu water management bureau 2011 sustainable urbanization needs to redress the degradation of land and water future work should be based on an evaluation of the carrying capacity of water resources and potential recharge to the local aquifer system 5 conclusions hydrochemical and isotopic tracers were used to understand the recharge sources and hydrogeochemical evolution of groundwater in the study area from the upper reaches of the dang river to the downstream irrigation area the concentrations of tds components in groundwater tended toincreasealong the flow path with changes in hydrochemical water type the hydrochemical features of the lake water and groundwater samples collected from the observation boreholes were similar to those of groundwater samples near the dang river channel the paleo channel of the dang river has considerableeffectsnot only on the sedimentary environment of the lake but also on the groundwater hydrochemistry a gradual enrichment in stable isotopes was observed along the regional groundwater flow path although the calculated recharge altitude indicates a water supply from deep aquifers to the south of the lake characteristic δ2h and δ18o compositions confirmed the shallow unconfined sedimentary aquifers and the lake are mainly recharged by leakage from the dang river while deep confined aquifers are recharged by deep lateral groundwater flow via the fault zones in the piedmont of the qilian mountains the 3h content in water samples collected from the study area varied from 11 to 40 t u which indicates modern precipitation is the primary recharge source of groundwater with pre modern older than about 60 years in age precipitation accounting for only a small fraction of groundwater recharge the lake is a window into the groundwater table that has been cut out of low lying terrain in the sand dunes the results of modeling using cl and δ18o data showed the recharge ratios of influentwater from the dang river and deep groundwater are about 43 and 22 respectively with artificial recharge into the aquifer around the lake accounting for the remaining 35 although the regional hydrogeological conditions arid climate and sand deposition have negative influences on the size of the lake the regional groundwater table decline is primarily a consequence of the attenuation of groundwater recharge which was caused by the construction of dang river reservoir seepage of drainage canals and excessiveexploitation of

5983,copula functions are widely used in multivariate hydrological risk assessment incorporation of uncertainty analysis within copula functions can improve the degree of reliability to risk inference in this study a bayesian copula based frequency analysis bcfa method is developed for supporting multivariate hydrological risk assessment under uncertainty through integrating copula functions and markov chain monte carlo mcmc into a general framework bcfa is not only capable of identifying multivariate characteristics of hydrological extreme events but also useful for assessing multiple uncertain parameters in their dependence structure bcfa is applied to a real case of flood risk assessment in the naryn river a typical high mountain watershed with high frequency snowmelt flood in central asia major findings can be summarized i the uncertainty range of joint distribution is mainly influenced by the value of flood variable and the selection of copula function where the uncertainty range would decreases along with flood variable value ii in a same flood event the probability of both flood duration and flood volume reaching extreme large values is highest and the probability of either flood peak or flood duration exceeding a certain threshold is highest iii high peak flows large than 1828 4 m3 s are usually accompanied with flood durations less than 24 4 day or flood volumes less than 17 6 103 m3 d s the findings are helpful for providing decision support of flood management and disaster prevention keywords bayesian inference copula flood management multivariate frequency analysis naryn river risk assessment 1 introduction 1 1 importance and motivation hydrological frequency analysis is widely used for estimating the occurrence probabilities of extreme hydrological events e g flood drought and storm which could provide decision supports for many practical applications such as hydrological infrastructure design reservoir operation management and disaster prevention requena et al 2017 remesan et al 2018 van de vyver and van den bergh 2018 sharifi et al 2019 traditionally univariate hydrological frequency analysis is usually employed to describe the characteristics of extreme hydrological events e g flood peak drought intensity and rainfall severity genest et al 2007 chebana et al 2013 extreme hydrological events are often characterized by multiple properties that are correlated with each other due to their internal physical connections for example the severity of a flood event is not only defined by high peak flow but also by flood duration and volume karmakar and simonovic 2008 univariate hydrological frequency analysis provides a limited assessment of extreme hydrological events while a number of hydrological practices e g dam design reservoir operation and flood diversion require the knowledge of multivariate characteristics of extreme hydrological events thus multivariate hydrological frequency analysis is desired for accurately describing an extreme hydrological event and obtaining useful information for risk assessment flood as an extreme hydrological event is one of the most devastating natural hazards inflicting mortality as well as extensive property and infrastructure damages gangrade et al 2019 central asia is located in the inland of the eurasian continent and characterized by arid and semi arid climates in central asia more than half of the annual precipitation falls as snow during the winter season particularly in the headwater regions of the two main rivers amu darya river and syr darya river where snowmelt floods are common occurrence in the spring season gerlitz et al 2018 li et al 2019 for instance in 2010 a flood event occurred in tajikistan and caused over 70 fatalities and over 200 million in damage 3 5 of the gross domestic product world bank 2017 such flood risk brings about great challenges to the local human beings as well as social and economic development therefore it is desired to describe the snowmelt flood characteristics to support flood control and mitigation of central asia using more robust multivariate frequency analysis approaches 1 2 literature review copula functions provide an ideal means for joint probabilistic modeling of two or more random variables over the past decades numerous approaches based on copula functions were developed for multivariate frequency analysis of extreme hydrological events such as flood balistrocchi et al 2017 durocher et al 2018 yin et al 2018 drought ayantobo et al 2018 montaseri et al 2018 van de vyver and van den bergh 2018 and storm rainfall goswami et al 2018 sadegh et al 2018 suroso and bardossy 2018 zellou and rahali 2019 for example balistrocchi et al 2017 used bivariate copula functions to describe the dependence structure between flood peak and volume in panaro river italy results showed that the bivariate return period of flood peak and volume is useful for time continuous modeling of a flood control reservoir ayantobo et al 2018 employed bivariate archimedean copula functions to assess drought risk in the mainland china where the multivariate drought characteristics were identified through standardized precipitation evapotranspiration index spei and the drought risk was analyzed using drought probability and return period goswami et al 2018 conducted bivariate copula functions to analyze the multivariate probabilistic characteristics of precipitation extremes based on different coupled model intercomparison project phase 5 cmip5 datasets in himalayan indian yin et al 2018 employed univariate and copula based bivariate frequency analysis approach to describe the correlated nature of flood peak and volume under different climate change scenarios in ganjiang river basin china results indicated that the joint probability of flood peak and volume varies significantly under the changing climate conditions a number of trivariate copula functions were also used for multivariate frequency analysis of extreme hydrological events hao et al 2017 hangshing and dabral 2018 zhu et al 2019 for instance hao et al 2017 utilized trivariate copula functions to model drought properties in terms of occurrence probability and return period in southwest china results showed that copula functions are useful tools in exploring drought frequency and the selection of copula functions is important for analyzing drought risk hangshing and dabral 2018 used archimedean and metaelliptical copulas to model trivariate joint distributions of meteorological droughts in agartala india in which joint distributions and return periods were calculated to estimate drought risk zhu et al 2019 used bivariate and trivariate copula functions to describe the dependence structures between meteorological and hydrological droughts results indicated that the copula based method is effective for probabilistic prediction of drought characteristics generally copula based methods are capable of exploring multivariate characteristics of hydrological extreme events which are easy implement and have an advantage in separately considering marginal distributions and multivariate dependence modeling reddy and ganguli 2012 sraj et al 2015 however copula based hydrological frequency analysis often involves multiple uncertainties derived from input data and parameters as well as the choices of marginal and copula functions parameters in copula functions are usually estimated through method of moments like mom estimator which are mainly dependent on the sample rank correlation and involve uncertainty resulting from input data markov chain monte carlo mcmc based on bayesian statistical inference was extensively used for parameter estimation and uncertainty assessment kwon and lall 2016 vrugt 2016 sadegh et al 2017 anis et al 2018 fan et al 2018 malagò et al 2018 rana et al 2019 mcmc infers the posterior distribution from a combination of prior distribution and likelihood function in which empirical knowledge and sampling information are encoded respectively jia et al 2018 for example kwon and lall 2016 proposed a bivariate copula based nonstationary probabilistic model to assess the time varying return periods of drought duration and severity where mcmc named as gibbs sampler was employed to estimate the posterior parameter distributions of marginal distributions and copula functions sadegh et al 2017 developed a multivariate copula analysis toolbox mvcat for multivariate frequency analysis where a hybrid evolution mcmc approach is used for estimating the parameter uncertainty in copula function results showed that the proposed approach is useful to explore applicability of different copula functions under uncertainty generally copula functions are effective for modeling dependence structure of multivariate characteristics of extreme hydrological events they are incapable of handling the multiple uncertainties associated with parameter input data and model structure mcmc provides a mathematical framework for parameter estimation and uncertainty analysis where the posterior distributions of copula parameters are sampled from a well constructed markov chain and the parameter uncertainties are assessed through straightforward bayesian inference hybrid method coupling copula functions with mcmc can analyze the multivariate risk of hydrological extreme event and assess the uncertainties in the copula parameters 1 3 novelty and contribution the novelty and contribution of this study is to develop a hybrid of bayesian copula based frequency analysis bcfa for assessing multivariate flood risk bcfa has advantages in reflecting parameter uncertainty in dependence structure of multivariate frequency analysis the feasibility and applicability of bcfa have been demonstrated in multivariate flood risk assessment of the naryn river which is a typical high mountain watershed with high frequency snowmelt flood in central asia the detailed tasks are 1 identifying the multiple variables of flood events based on flood peak volume and duration 2 modeling the dependence structure among

joint distribution conditional distribution and return period as well as their corresponding confidence intervals within a multivariate context 2 methodology 2 1 characteristics of flood events the typical characteristics of a flood event consist of flood peak flow duration and volume yue et al 1999 in this study the flood peak flow q i is defined as annual maximum value of daily runoff in the ith year flood duration d i as defined yue et al 1999 1 d i e d i s d i where sd i and ed i are start date and end date of a flood event for the ith year respectively the flood volume v i can be calculated yue et al 1999 2 v i v i total v i base j s d i e d i q ij 1 2 q is q ie 1 d i where qij is the observed runoff of jth day for ith year qis and qie are observed runoffs on start date and end date for the ith year respectively three food pairs i e peak duration peak volume and duration volume can be achieved and their dependence structures can be modeled through copula functions 2 2 copulas theory copula functions join or couple multivariate distribution functions with standard uniform margins which represent the dependence structure of a vector of time independent variables ghorbel and trabelsi 2014 based on sklar s theorem a multivariate probability distribution f can be expressed as nelsen 2006 3 f x 1 x 2 x n c u 1 u 2 u n where u 1 f x 1 x 1 u 2 f x 2 x 2 u n f x n x

11 t u 1 u 2 or μ 1 c u 1 u 2 where μ is the mean inter arrival time of two consecutive flood events to further understand the concurrence probability of two flood variables the bivariate risk

statistical inference is effective for uncertainty assessment and parameter estimation where parameters are assumed to random variables with probability distributions ajami et al 2007 vrugt 2016 the basic theorem of bayesian inference is 13 π θ y obs π θ p y obs θ p y obs π θ l θ y where π θ y obs and π θ are the posterior and prior parameter probability density distribution respectively p y obs p θ p y θ d θ is marginal likelihood acts as a normalization constant and p y obs θ l θ y obs is the likelihood function however the posterior distributions of parameters are difficult to calculate or analytical approximation in practical application mcmc provides a simple and efficient way to estimate the posterior distribution of parameter in this study the posterior distributions of parameters in copula functions are estimated through random walk metropolis rwm algorithm rwm is a commonly used mcmc algorithm which employs proposal distribution to generate a trial move from current markov chain θt 1 to a new state θt and then a accept probability is used to determine whether to accept a trial move or not vrugt 2016 more details on the theoretical background and methodology of rwm can be found in robert and casella 2004 2 5 goodness of fit statistical tests in this study root mean square error rmse and akaike s information criterion aic are used for goodness of fit test of marginal and copula functions their equations are willmott et al 1985 akaike 1987 14 rmse i 1 n x i e s t x i o b s 2 n 15 aic n ln r m s e 2 2 k where xi est and xi obs are theoretical probabilities from fitted distribution functions and empirical values from observed data respectively n is the sample size k is unknown parameters in probability functions kolmogorov smirnov k s test is employed to evaluate fitting effects of marginal distribution functions to flood variables k s test is a non parametric hypothesis test based on the null hypothesis that the samples of flood variables are drawn from the reference distributions the k s statistic is calculated conover 1999 16 t sup x f est x f obs x where sup x is the supremum of distance sets fest x and fobs x are the estimated and empirical distributions respectively the p value of k s test is larger than 0 05 indicating a marginal distribution is suitable for the flood variable the best fitting marginal distribution is selected as having the minimum rmse aic and t statistic values cramér von mises cvm test is employed to evaluate fitting effects of copula functions to flood pairs cvm test is based on kendall s transform proposed by wang and wells 2000 and its associated p value can be obtained using parametric bootstrap genest et al 2009 the upper lower tail dependence coefficient has been widely used in many studies for selecting the appropriate copula functions poulin et al 2008 qian et al 2017 however the previous studies show that the estimation of tail dependence coefficient is biased and susceptible under finite sample sizes michailidi and bacchi 2017 suroso and bardossy 2018 therefore the upper lower tail dependence coefficient is not considered in this study fig 1 presents the framework of bcfa method which includes five parts i flood characteristics identify ii marginal distribution selection iii joint distribution construction through copula functions iv uncertainty analysis based on mcmc v multivariate and conditional flood risk analysis 3 study area and data the proposed bcfa method is applied to flood risk analysis for naryn river which is one of the main tributaries of syr darya river in central asia fig 2 the naryn river originates from tien shan mountains in kyrgyzstan and flows into ferghana valley where it merges with kara darya river to form the syr darya river hagg et al 2013 it has a main stream length of 807 km and a catchment area of 58 205 km2 gan et al 2015 as a typical arid area in high mountain region snow and glacier are major contributors to runoff during the spring and summer seasons dedieu et al 2014 the flooding season is from april to august and is triggered by heavy precipitation in winter and the sharp warming in spring in this study the daily discharge data 1936 2015 at kurgan hydrological station 41 17 n 72 10 e is used for hydrological risk analysis fig 3 shows the variations of three flood variables i e flood peak duration and volume at kurgan hydrological station and their statistical characteristics are presented in table 1 4 result and discussion 4 1 marginal distribution in this study the marginal distributions for three flood variables i e peak duration and volume are modeled based on 8 parametric probabilistic distributions i e normal log normal gamma generalized extreme value gumbel pearson type iii weibull and generalized pareto distribution johnson et al 1995 table 2 shows the estimated parameter values through maximum likelihood estimation mle method and their statistical test results i e rmse aic and k s test fig 4 illustrates the empirical and calculated cumulative distribution functions cdfs for the three flood variables the most fitted marginal distributions for peak duration and volume are weibull generalized pareto and pearson type iii respectively the rmse values of peak duration and volume are 0 0255 0 0380 and 0 0305 respectively the aic values of peak duration and volume are 582 78 517 33 and 552 17 respectively the associated p values for k s test are larger than 0 05 the results show that the model performance is well in quantifying the marginal distributions of peak volume and duration 4 2 joint distribution two non parametric dependence measures i e kendall s tau and spearman s rho are used for evaluating the dependence of flood variables as shown in table 3 the p values of flood pairs i e duration volume peak volume and duration volume are less than 0 05 indicating that the dependences of flood pairs are significant the correlation of duration volume is higher than peak duration and peak volume similar results of correlation coefficients were also reported by some previous studies sraj et al 2015 fan et al 2016 to define the prior distribution and screen out the suitable copula functions the parameters of copula functions are firstly estimated by mom based on kendall s tau and their results are provided in table 4 the performances of copula functions for modeling joint distribution of flood variables are evaluated by rmse aic and cvm test and their results are also listed in table 4 the number of bootstrap samples of cvm test is fixed at n 5000 the p value larger than 0 05 indicates that the copula function is suitable for the flood pair the best fitting copula function is selected as having the minimum aic most of copula functions are suitable for the three flood pairs except clayton copula for peak volume and duration volume and frank copula for duration volume and the best fitting copula functions for peak duration peak volume and duration volume are clayton gaussian and t copula respectively the mom estimator could represent the relationship between sample rank correlation and the copula parameter reddy and ganguli 2012 however due to the systematic and random measurement errors of hydrological station the errors of sample rank correlation are inevitably occurred in the processes of parameter estimations in this study the posterior distributions of parameters in copula functions are estimated based on mcmc with rwm algorithm the prior distributions of copula parameters are assumed to follow gaussian distribution n μ σ2 with the mean values obtained by the mom method and with relatively large variance value σ2 5 this assumption is widely used in many literatures for bayesian inference due to its ease of implementation and little prior knowledge available about the range of the parameter space fan et al 2018 tang et al 2018 van de vyver 2015 for rwm algorithm parameterization a markov chain containing 10 000 iterations is carried the first 8000 iterations are ruled out as burn period and posterior distributions of the parameters are derived from the last 2000 iterations fig 5 presents the kernel smoothing densities of posterior pdfs for the parameter in copula functions most of the copula parameters are well identified and their posterior distributions are different from their prior distributions in term of shapes and parameter ranges to assess whether or not the posterior distributions are approximately normal distributed the normal probability plots of the posterior pdfs are calculated as shown in fig 6 most of posterior pdfs are close to normal distributions with relative symmetric densities some posterior pdfs e g gumbel copula for peak duration are the s shaped curvatures indicating that their posterior distributions are not considered as normal distributions table 5 presents the optimized parameters of copula functions estimated through mcmc and their performance indices results show a good performance of mcmc in parameter uncertainty analysis and the optimized parameters through mcmc are not completely in accordance with the mom based on the aic values clayton copula is best for modeling the dependence structure of peak duration gaussian copula is best for modeling the dependence structures of peak volume and duration volume particularly the joint distribution of duration volume can be quantified best by gaussian copula as compared to mom by t copula accordingly clayton copula would be chosen to model the dependence of peak duration gaussian copula would be chosen to model the dependence of peak volume and duration volume to further understand how the uncertainties in copula parameters translate into the joint distribution fig 7 illustrates the joint distributions of flood pairs for most fitted copula functions and their contour plots under 95 confidence interval 95pci take the contour plot of peak duration as an example when flood peak is larger than 2000 m3 s the confidence intervals of joint distributions are quite narrow in contrast when flood peak is less than 1500 m3 s or flood duration is less than 120 day the confidence intervals of joint distributions are wider the results indicate that the uncertainty ranges of joint distributions are wider when flood variables approach to their lower values furthermore the confidence intervals of joint distribution of peak duration are narrower than other two pairs implying less parameter uncertainty in the dependence structures of peak duration for clayton copula the uncertainty ranges may be influenced by the use of different copula functions or by the low dependence between the flood pair of peak duration fig 8 presents the contour plots of joint distributions of flood pairs for different copula functions i e guassian frank galambos and plackett copula under 95pci the confidence intervals of three flood pairs from plackett copula are narrower than those from other copula functions and the confidence intervals from gaussian copula are wider than those from other copula functions for different flood pairs the confidence intervals of joint densities change insignificantly results disclose that the uncertainty range of joint probability is mainly influenced by the selection of copula function 4 3 conditional and multivariate risk analysis fig 9 presents the conditional cdfs of flood variables based on eqs 5 and 6 these plots show how one flood variable affects the cumulative distribution of other flood variable and its confidence interval for example the plot of peak duration shows the cdf of flood peak at different percentiles of flood duration i e 5 50 and 95 the cumulative probabilities of flood peak would decrease as the percentiles of flood duration increase implying a positive correlation between flood peak and flood duration the confidence interval of flood peak cdf is widest at the 5 percentile of flood duration indicating the larger uncertainty range for the less percentile of flood duration this is due to the fact that higher uncertainty ranges of joint distributions when flood variables approach to their lower values the lower flood variable values should be paid more attention in order to obtain robust multivariate flood risk assessment table 6 shows the joint return periods of and and or cases for the three flood pairs based on eqs 11 and 12 according to the definition joint return periods of and cases indicate the probability that both two flood variables reach extreme large values in a same flood event joint return periods of or cases indicate the probability that either two flood variables exceeds a certain threshold in a same flood event the joint periods of or cases for all flood pairs are much less than joint periods of and cases the higher return periods the greater differences between and joint periods and or joint periods the and return periods of duration volume are shorter than other two flood pairs indicating the highest risk of concurrence of long duration and large volume this is due to high correlation between flood duration and volume the and return periods of peak duration are much larger than other two flood pairs and the or return periods of peak duration are shorter than other two flood pairs the results indicate that the high peak flow is usually accompanied by short duration in a same flood event and the risk of either peak flow or duration exceeds a certain threshold is highest than other two flood pairs fig 10 further illustrates the counter plots of the joint return periods of and and or cases the confidence intervals of and and or return periods for peak duration are narrower than other two flood pairs indicating less uncertainty ranges for the joint return periods of peak duration this is because the dependence structure of peak duration is modeled by clayton copula which has lower uncertainty range of joint distribution than other two flood pairs modeled by gaussian copula the uncertainty ranges are narrower when and return periods larger than 300 day or or return periods larger than 30 day indicating less uncertainty ranges of joint return periods when flood variables approach to their higher values this is because the uncertainty ranges of joint distributions are narrower when flood variables approach to their higher values similar findings are also reported by sadegh et al 2017 the uncertainty ranges of joint return periods in the lower flood variable values are indeed significant and cannot be neglected since the damage caused by a flood event is largely dependent on flood peak flow the bivariate risk indictor of peak duration and peak volume was calculated the bivariate risk indictor represents the concurrence probabilities of peak duration and peak volume based on equations 13 as shown in fig 11 three service scenarios i e 50 70 100 year for river levee around kurgan station and three return periods i e 50 70 100 year for flood peak are investigated if flood durations are less than 24 4 day confidence interval of 23 6 25 2 day the bivariate flood risk of peak duration would not decrease significantly for all service scenarios and return periods high peak flood event is usually accompanied with the flood duration less than 24 4 day confidence interval of 23 6 25 2 day similarly if flood volume is less than 17 6 103 m3 d s confidence interval of 10 2 25 4 103 m3 d s the bivariate risk of peak volume would not decrease significantly indicating that high peak flood event is usually accompanied with the flood volume less than 17 6 103 m3 d s confidence interval of 10 2 25 4 103 m3 d s fig 11 also shows relatively large uncertainties in each bivariate risk level take the plot of 50 year service scenario of peak volume as an example when the value of flood volume is 40 103 m3 d s the low and upper bounds of bivariate risk between flood peak and volume would be 56 7 and 60 7 respectively the ranges of confidence intervals for all peak volume scenarios are wider than peak duration scenarios the results are because of the uncertainty ranges in the joint distributions of peak volume and peak duration and the uncertainty range of peak volume is wider than peak duration as presented in fig 7 5 conclusions in this study a bayesian copula based frequency analysis bcfa method has been developed for supporting multivariate hydrological risk analysis under uncertainty through integrating the mcmc and copula functions into a general framework bcfa can help 1 characterize the multivariate properties of hydrological extreme events 2 infer posterior distributions of copula parameters with bayesian statistical inference which considers prior information and provides more reasonable values and confidence intervals of copula parameters 3 assess hydrological risk and their corresponding confidence intervals within multivariate context the developed bcfa has been applied to the snowmelt flood risk analysis of a real case study in the naryn river central asia where is a typical high mountain watershed with high frequency snowmelt flood compared with 8 parametric probabilistic distributions and 12 copula functions with different families weibull generalized pareto and pearson type iii would be better for quantifying the marginal distributions of peak duration and volume respectively clayton copula would be better for modeling the dependence of peak duration gaussian copula would be better for modeling the dependence of peak volume and duration volume some major findings can be summarized i the uncertainty range of joint distribution decreases along with flood variable value which would translate into conditional distribution joint return period and bivariate flood risk more attention should be paid to the lower value of flood variable to obtain precise flood risk assessment ii compared with the three flood pairs for different copula functions the uncertainty range of joint distribution is mainly influenced by the selection of copula functions iii in a same flood event the probability of both flood duration and flood volume reaching extreme large values is highest followed by peak volume and peak duration the probability of either flood peak or flood duration exceeding a certain threshold is highest followed by peak volume and duration volume iv high peak flows large than 1828 4 m3 s are usually accompanied with flood durations less than 24 4 day confidence interval of 23 6 25 2 day or flood volumes less than 17 6 103 m3 d s confidence interval of 10 2 25 4 103 m3 d s the above findings are helpful for i gaining insight into the relationships between multivariate flood variables ii providing decision support for flood control mitigation such as hydrological infrastructure design reservoir operation management and flood diversion measures this study is the first attempt to apply bcfa in multivariate flood risk assessment under uncertainty however there are also some potential extensions of the proposed method for example in this study bcfa has been used for reflecting multivariate flood characteristics and quantifying the uncertainty in dependence structure in fact the natural and anthropogenic processes e g climate change land use variation and human activity influence flood occurrence course which may result in some biased results in the flood risk assessment thus some robust approaches e g hydro climatological model are desired to be incorporated into

5983,copula functions are widely used in multivariate hydrological risk assessment incorporation of uncertainty analysis within copula functions can improve the degree of reliability to risk inference in this study a bayesian copula based frequency analysis bcfa method is developed for supporting multivariate hydrological risk assessment under uncertainty through integrating copula functions and markov chain monte carlo mcmc into a general framework bcfa is not only capable of identifying multivariate characteristics of hydrological extreme events but also useful for assessing multiple uncertain parameters in their dependence structure bcfa is applied to a real case of flood risk assessment in the naryn river a typical high mountain watershed with high frequency snowmelt flood in central asia major findings can be summarized i the uncertainty range of joint distribution is mainly influenced by the value of flood variable and the selection of copula function where the uncertainty range would decreases along with flood variable value ii in a same flood event the probability of both flood duration and flood volume reaching extreme large values is highest and the

multivariate frequency analysis naryn river risk assessment 1 introduction 1 1 importance and motivation hydrological frequency analysis is widely used for estimating the occurrence probabilities of extreme hydrological events e g flood drought and storm which could provide decision supports for many practical applications such as hydrological infrastructure design reservoir operation management and disaster prevention requena et al 2017 remesan et al 2018 van de vyver and van den bergh 2018 sharifi et al 2019 traditionally univariate hydrological frequency analysis is usually employed to describe the characteristics of extreme hydrological events e g flood peak drought intensity and rainfall severity genest et al 2007 chebana et al 2013 extreme hydrological events are often characterized by multiple properties that are correlated with each other due to their internal physical connections for example the severity of a flood event is not only defined by high peak flow but also by flood duration and volume karmakar and simonovic 2008 univariate hydrological frequency analysis provides a limited assessment of extreme hydrological events while a number of hydrological practices e g dam design reservoir operation and flood diversion require the knowledge of multivariate characteristics of extreme hydrological events thus multivariate hydrological frequency analysis is desired for accurately describing an extreme hydrological event and obtaining useful information for risk assessment flood as an extreme hydrological event is one of the most devastating natural hazards inflicting mortality as well as extensive property and infrastructure damages gangrade et al 2019 central asia is located in the inland of the eurasian continent and characterized by arid and semi arid climates in central asia more than half of the annual precipitation falls as snow during the winter season particularly in the headwater regions of the two main rivers amu darya river and syr darya river where snowmelt floods are common occurrence in the spring season gerlitz et al 2018 li et al 2019 for instance in 2010 a flood event occurred in tajikistan and caused over 70 fatalities and over 200 million in damage 3 5 of the gross domestic product world bank 2017 such flood risk brings about great challenges to the local human beings as well as social and economic development therefore it is desired to describe the snowmelt flood characteristics to support flood control and mitigation of central asia using more robust multivariate frequency analysis approaches 1 2 literature review copula functions provide an ideal means for joint probabilistic modeling of two or more random variables over the past decades numerous approaches based on copula functions were developed for multivariate frequency analysis of extreme hydrological events such as flood balistrocchi et al 2017 durocher et al 2018 yin et al 2018 drought ayantobo et al 2018 montaseri et al 2018 van de vyver and van den bergh 2018 and storm rainfall goswami et al 2018 sadegh et al 2018 suroso and bardossy 2018 zellou and rahali 2019 for example balistrocchi et al 2017 used bivariate copula functions to describe the dependence structure between flood peak and volume in panaro river italy results showed that the bivariate return period of flood peak and volume is useful for time continuous modeling of a flood control reservoir ayantobo et al 2018 employed bivariate archimedean copula functions to assess drought risk in the mainland china where the multivariate drought characteristics were identified through standardized precipitation evapotranspiration index spei and the drought risk was analyzed using drought probability and return period goswami et al 2018 conducted bivariate copula functions to analyze the multivariate probabilistic characteristics of precipitation extremes based on different coupled model intercomparison project phase 5 cmip5 datasets in himalayan indian yin et al 2018 employed univariate and copula based bivariate frequency analysis approach to describe the correlated nature of flood peak and volume under different climate change scenarios in ganjiang river basin china results indicated that the joint probability of flood peak and volume varies significantly under the changing climate conditions a number of trivariate copula functions were also used for multivariate frequency analysis of extreme hydrological events hao et al 2017 hangshing and dabral 2018 zhu et al 2019 for instance hao et al 2017 utilized trivariate copula functions to model drought properties in terms of occurrence probability and return period in southwest china results showed that copula functions are useful tools in exploring drought frequency and the selection of copula functions is important for analyzing drought risk hangshing and dabral 2018 used archimedean and metaelliptical copulas to model trivariate joint distributions of meteorological droughts in agartala india in which joint distributions and return periods were calculated to estimate drought risk zhu et al 2019 used bivariate and trivariate copula functions to describe the dependence structures between meteorological and hydrological droughts results indicated that the copula based method is effective for probabilistic prediction of drought characteristics generally copula based methods are capable of exploring multivariate characteristics of hydrological extreme events which are easy implement and have an advantage in separately considering marginal distributions and multivariate dependence modeling reddy and ganguli 2012 sraj et al 2015 however copula based hydrological frequency analysis often involves multiple uncertainties derived from input data and parameters as well as the choices of marginal and copula functions parameters in copula functions are usually estimated through method of moments like mom estimator which are mainly dependent on the sample rank correlation and involve uncertainty resulting from input data markov chain monte carlo mcmc based on bayesian statistical inference was extensively used for parameter estimation and uncertainty assessment kwon and lall 2016 vrugt 2016 sadegh et al 2017 anis et al 2018 fan et al 2018 malagò et al 2018 rana et al 2019 mcmc infers the posterior distribution from a combination of prior distribution and likelihood function in which empirical knowledge and sampling information are encoded respectively jia et al 2018 for example kwon and lall 2016 proposed a bivariate copula based nonstationary probabilistic model to assess the time varying return periods of drought duration and severity where mcmc named as gibbs sampler was employed to estimate the posterior parameter distributions of marginal distributions and copula functions sadegh et al 2017 developed a multivariate copula analysis toolbox mvcat for multivariate frequency analysis where a hybrid evolution mcmc approach is used for estimating the parameter uncertainty in copula function results showed that the proposed approach is useful to explore applicability of different copula functions under uncertainty generally copula functions are effective for modeling dependence structure of multivariate characteristics of extreme hydrological events they are incapable of handling the multiple uncertainties associated with parameter input data and model structure mcmc provides a mathematical framework for parameter estimation and uncertainty analysis where the posterior distributions of copula parameters are sampled from a well constructed markov chain and the parameter uncertainties are assessed through straightforward bayesian inference hybrid method coupling copula functions with mcmc can analyze the multivariate risk of hydrological extreme event and assess the uncertainties in the copula parameters 1 3 novelty and contribution the novelty and contribution of this study is to develop a hybrid of bayesian copula based frequency analysis bcfa for assessing multivariate flood risk bcfa has advantages in reflecting parameter uncertainty in dependence structure of multivariate frequency analysis the feasibility and applicability of bcfa have been demonstrated in multivariate flood risk assessment of the naryn river which is a typical high mountain watershed with high frequency snowmelt flood in central asia the detailed tasks are 1 identifying the multiple variables of flood events based on flood peak volume and duration 2 modeling the dependence structure among the three flood variables through copula functions 3 inferring the posterior distributions of copula parameters with bayesian inference through mcmc 4 assessing the multiple flood characteristics i e joint distribution conditional distribution and return period as well as their corresponding confidence intervals within a multivariate context 2 methodology 2 1 characteristics of flood events the typical characteristics of a flood event consist of flood peak flow duration and volume yue et al 1999 in this study the flood peak flow q i is defined as annual maximum value of daily runoff in the ith year flood duration d i as defined yue et al 1999 1 d i e d i s d i where sd i and ed i are start date and end date of a flood event for the ith year respectively the flood volume v i can be calculated yue et al 1999 2 v i v i total v i base j s d i e d i q ij 1 2 q is q ie 1 d i where qij is the observed runoff of jth day for ith year qis and qie are observed runoffs on start date and end date for the ith year respectively three food pairs i e peak duration peak volume and duration volume can be achieved and their dependence structures can be modeled through copula functions 2 2 copulas theory copula functions join or couple multivariate distribution functions with standard uniform margins which represent the dependence structure of a vector of time independent variables ghorbel and trabelsi 2014 based on sklar s theorem a multivariate probability distribution f can be expressed as nelsen 2006 3 f x 1 x 2 x n c u 1 u 2 u n where u 1 f x 1 x 1 u 2 f x 2 x 2 u n f x n x n are continuous marginal distributions of random variables x1 x2 xn a copula function c can be written as nelsen 2006 4 c u 1 u 2 u n f f x 1 1 u 1 f x 2 1 u 2 f x n 1 u n for any given copula function the conditional distribution for each xi can be achieved taking a bivariate copula as an example the conditional distribution function of u1 with u2 u2 and u2 u2 can be achieved as follows 5 c u 1 u 2 u 2 u 1 p u 1 u 1 u 2 u 2 c u 1 u 2 u 2 6 c u 1 u 2 u 2 u 1 p u 1 u 1 u 2 u 2 c u 1 u 2 u 2 the probability density function pdf of a copula can be expressed as 7 c u 1 u 2 2 c u 1 u 2 u 1 u

1 x 1 c u 1 u 2 various copula families that represent different dependence structures have been developed including elliptical archimedean and extreme value families nelsen 2006 in this study 12 copula functions i e gaussian student t clayton frank gumbel amh joe galambos husler reiss tawn fgm and plackett copula with different families i e elliptical archimedean extreme value and others are used for screening out the appropriate copula functions for modeling the dependence structure of multiple flood characteristics plackett 1965 ali et al 1978 clayton 1978 nelsen 2006 li et al 2013 huynh et al 2014 2 3 multivariate hydrological risk analysis return period of flood event is a basic criterion for design of hydrological infrastructure and provides a simple means of flood risk analysis salvadori and michele 2010 in multivariate flood risk analysis the joint return periods i e and and or can be calculated as salvadori and michele 2010 10 t u 1 u 2 and μ 1 u 1 u 2 c u 1 u 2 11 t u 1 u 2 or μ 1 c u 1 u 2 where μ is the mean inter arrival time of two consecutive flood events to further understand the concurrence probability of two flood variables the bivariate risk indictor can be defined as fan et al 2016 12 r u 1 u 2 1 1 p u 1 u 2 n 1 q u 1 u 2 n 1 1 1 t u 1 u 2 and n where r u 1 u 2 is the joint risk of two flood variables n is the design life of hydrological infrastructures p u 1 u 2 and q u 1 u 2 are the joint exceedance and nonexceedance probabilities respectively t u 1 u 2 and is the joint return period of a flood event 2 4 bayesian inference bayesian statistical inference is effective for uncertainty assessment and parameter estimation where parameters are assumed to random variables with probability distributions ajami et al 2007 vrugt 2016 the basic theorem of bayesian inference is 13 π θ y obs π θ p y obs θ p y obs π θ l θ y where π θ y obs and π θ are the posterior and prior parameter probability density distribution respectively p y obs p θ p y θ d θ is marginal likelihood acts as a normalization constant and p y obs θ l θ y obs is the likelihood function however the posterior distributions of parameters are difficult to calculate or analytical approximation in practical application mcmc provides a simple and efficient way to estimate the posterior distribution of parameter in this study the posterior distributions of parameters in copula functions are estimated through random walk metropolis rwm algorithm rwm is a commonly used mcmc algorithm which employs proposal distribution to generate a trial move from current markov chain θt 1 to a new state θt and then a accept probability is used to determine whether to accept a trial move or not vrugt 2016 more details on the theoretical background and methodology of rwm can be found in robert and casella 2004 2 5 goodness of fit statistical tests in this study root mean square error rmse and akaike s information criterion aic are used for goodness of fit test of marginal and copula functions their equations are willmott et al 1985 akaike 1987 14 rmse i 1 n x i e s t x i o b s 2 n 15 aic n ln r m s e 2 2 k where xi est and xi obs are theoretical probabilities from fitted distribution functions and empirical values from observed data respectively n is the sample size k is unknown parameters in probability functions kolmogorov smirnov k s test is employed to evaluate fitting effects of marginal distribution functions to flood variables k s test is a non parametric hypothesis test based on the null hypothesis that the samples of flood variables are drawn from the reference distributions the k s statistic is calculated conover 1999 16 t sup x f est x f obs x where sup x is the supremum of distance sets fest x and fobs x are the estimated and empirical distributions respectively the p value of k s test is larger than 0 05 indicating a marginal distribution is suitable for the flood variable the best fitting marginal distribution is selected as having the minimum rmse aic and t statistic values cramér von mises cvm test is employed to evaluate fitting effects of copula functions to flood pairs cvm test is based on kendall s transform proposed by wang and wells 2000 and its associated p value can be obtained using parametric bootstrap genest et al 2009 the upper lower tail dependence coefficient has been widely used in many studies for selecting the appropriate copula functions poulin et al 2008 qian et al 2017 however the previous studies show that the estimation of tail dependence coefficient is biased and susceptible under finite sample sizes michailidi and bacchi 2017 suroso and bardossy 2018 therefore the upper lower tail dependence coefficient is not considered in this study fig 1 presents the framework of bcfa method which includes five parts i flood characteristics identify ii marginal distribution selection iii joint distribution construction through copula functions iv uncertainty analysis based on mcmc v multivariate and conditional flood risk analysis 3 study area and data the proposed bcfa method is applied to flood risk analysis for naryn river which is one of the main tributaries of syr darya river in central asia fig 2 the naryn river originates from tien shan mountains in kyrgyzstan and flows into ferghana valley where it merges with kara darya river to form the syr darya river hagg et al 2013 it has a main stream length of 807 km and a catchment area of 58 205 km2 gan et al 2015 as a typical arid area in high mountain region snow and glacier are major contributors to runoff during the spring and summer seasons dedieu et al 2014 the flooding season is from april to august and is triggered by heavy precipitation in winter and the sharp warming in spring in this study the daily discharge data 1936 2015 at kurgan hydrological station 41 17 n 72 10 e is used for hydrological risk analysis fig 3 shows the variations of three flood variables i e flood peak duration and volume at kurgan hydrological station and their statistical characteristics are presented in table 1 4 result and discussion 4 1 marginal distribution in this study the marginal distributions for three flood variables i e peak duration and volume are modeled based on 8 parametric probabilistic distributions i e normal log normal gamma generalized extreme value gumbel pearson type iii weibull and generalized pareto distribution johnson et al 1995 table 2 shows the estimated parameter values through maximum likelihood estimation mle method and their statistical test results i e rmse aic and k s test fig 4 illustrates the empirical and calculated cumulative distribution functions cdfs for the three flood variables the most fitted marginal distributions for peak duration and volume are weibull generalized pareto and pearson type iii respectively the rmse values of peak duration and volume are 0 0255 0 0380 and 0 0305 respectively the aic values of peak duration and volume are 582 78 517 33 and 552 17 respectively the associated p values for k s test are larger than 0 05 the results show that the model performance is well in quantifying the marginal distributions of peak volume and duration 4 2 joint distribution two non parametric dependence measures i e kendall s tau and spearman s rho are used for evaluating the dependence of flood variables as shown in table 3 the p values of flood pairs i e duration volume peak volume and duration volume are less than 0 05 indicating that the dependences of flood pairs are significant the correlation of duration volume is higher than peak duration and peak volume similar results of correlation coefficients were also reported by some previous studies sraj et al 2015 fan et al 2016 to define the prior distribution and screen out the suitable copula functions the parameters of copula functions are firstly estimated by mom based on kendall s tau and their results are provided in table 4 the performances of copula functions for modeling joint distribution of flood variables are evaluated by rmse aic and cvm test and their results are also listed in table 4 the number of bootstrap samples of cvm test is fixed at n 5000 the p value larger than 0 05 indicates that the copula function is suitable for the flood pair the best fitting copula function is selected as having the minimum aic most of copula functions are suitable for the three flood pairs except clayton copula for peak volume and duration volume and frank copula for duration volume and the best fitting copula functions for peak duration peak volume and duration volume are clayton gaussian and t copula respectively the mom estimator could represent the relationship between sample rank correlation and the copula parameter reddy and ganguli 2012 however due to the systematic and random measurement errors of hydrological station the errors of sample rank correlation are inevitably occurred in the processes of parameter estimations in this study the posterior distributions of parameters in copula functions are estimated based on mcmc with rwm algorithm the prior distributions of copula parameters are assumed to follow gaussian distribution n μ σ2 with the mean values obtained by the mom method and with relatively large variance value σ2 5 this assumption is widely used in many literatures for bayesian inference due to its ease of implementation and little prior knowledge available about the range of the parameter space fan et al 2018 tang et al 2018 van de vyver 2015 for rwm algorithm parameterization a markov chain containing 10 000 iterations is carried the first 8000 iterations are ruled out as burn period and posterior distributions of the parameters are derived from the last 2000 iterations fig 5 presents the kernel smoothing densities of posterior pdfs for the parameter in copula functions most of the copula parameters are well identified and their posterior distributions are different from their prior distributions in term of shapes and parameter ranges to assess whether or not the posterior distributions are approximately normal distributed the normal probability plots of the posterior pdfs are calculated as shown in fig 6 most of posterior pdfs are close to normal distributions with relative symmetric densities some posterior pdfs e g gumbel copula for peak duration are the s shaped curvatures indicating that their posterior distributions are not considered as normal distributions table 5 presents the optimized parameters of copula functions estimated through mcmc and their performance indices results show a good performance of mcmc in parameter uncertainty analysis and the optimized parameters through mcmc are not completely in accordance with the mom based on the aic values clayton copula is best for modeling the dependence structure of peak duration gaussian copula is best for modeling the dependence structures of peak volume and duration volume particularly the joint distribution of duration volume can be quantified best by gaussian copula as compared to mom by t copula accordingly clayton copula would be chosen to model the dependence of peak duration gaussian copula would be chosen to model the dependence of peak volume and duration volume to further understand how the uncertainties in copula parameters translate into the joint distribution fig 7 illustrates the joint distributions of flood pairs for most fitted copula functions and their contour plots under 95 confidence interval 95pci take the contour plot of peak duration as an example when flood peak is larger than 2000 m3 s the confidence intervals of joint distributions are quite narrow in contrast when flood peak is less than 1500 m3 s or flood duration is less than 120 day the confidence intervals of joint distributions are wider the results indicate that the uncertainty ranges of joint distributions are wider when flood variables approach to their lower values furthermore the confidence intervals of joint distribution of peak duration are narrower than other two pairs implying less parameter uncertainty in the dependence structures of peak duration for clayton copula the uncertainty ranges may be influenced by the use of different copula functions or by the low dependence between the flood pair of peak duration fig 8 presents the contour plots of joint distributions of flood pairs for different copula functions i e guassian frank galambos and plackett copula under 95pci the confidence intervals of three flood pairs from plackett copula are narrower than those from other copula functions and the confidence intervals from gaussian copula are wider than those from other copula functions for different flood pairs the confidence intervals of joint densities change insignificantly results disclose that the uncertainty range of joint probability is mainly influenced by the selection of copula function 4 3 conditional and multivariate risk analysis fig 9 presents the conditional cdfs of flood variables based on eqs 5 and 6 these plots show how one flood variable affects the cumulative distribution of other flood variable and its confidence interval for example the plot of peak duration shows the cdf of flood peak at different percentiles of flood duration i e 5 50 and 95 the cumulative probabilities of flood peak would decrease as the percentiles of flood duration increase implying a positive correlation between flood peak and flood duration the confidence interval of flood peak cdf is widest at the 5 percentile of flood duration indicating the larger uncertainty range for the less percentile of flood duration this is due to the fact that higher uncertainty ranges of joint distributions when flood variables approach to their lower values the lower flood variable values should be paid more attention in order to obtain robust multivariate flood risk assessment table 6 shows the joint return periods of and and or cases for the three flood pairs based on eqs 11 and 12 according to the definition joint return periods of and cases indicate the probability that both two flood variables reach extreme large values in a same flood event joint return periods of or cases indicate the probability that either two flood variables exceeds a certain threshold in a same flood event the joint periods of or cases for all flood pairs are much less than joint periods of and cases the higher return periods the greater differences between and joint periods and or joint periods the and return periods of duration volume are shorter than other two flood pairs indicating the highest risk of concurrence of long duration and large volume this is due to high correlation between flood duration and volume the and return periods of peak duration are much larger than other two flood pairs and the or return periods of peak duration are shorter than other two flood pairs the results indicate that the high peak flow is usually accompanied by short duration in a same flood event and the risk of either peak flow or duration exceeds a certain threshold is highest than other two flood pairs fig 10 further illustrates the counter plots of the joint return periods of and and or cases the confidence intervals of and and or return periods for peak duration are narrower than other two flood pairs indicating less uncertainty ranges for the joint return periods of peak duration this is because the dependence structure of peak duration is modeled by clayton copula which has lower uncertainty range of joint distribution than other two flood pairs modeled by gaussian copula the uncertainty ranges are narrower when and return periods larger than 300 day or or return periods larger than 30 day indicating less uncertainty ranges of joint return periods when flood variables approach to their higher values this is because the uncertainty ranges of joint distributions are narrower when flood variables approach to their higher values similar findings are also reported by sadegh et al 2017 the uncertainty ranges of joint return periods in the lower flood variable values are indeed significant and cannot be neglected since the damage caused by a flood event is largely dependent on flood peak flow the bivariate risk indictor of peak duration and peak volume was calculated the bivariate risk indictor represents the concurrence probabilities of peak duration and peak volume based on equations 13 as shown in fig 11 three service scenarios i e 50 70 100 year for river levee around kurgan station and three return periods i e 50 70 100 year for flood peak are investigated if flood durations are less than 24 4 day confidence interval of 23 6 25 2 day the bivariate flood risk of peak duration would not decrease significantly for all service scenarios and return periods high peak flood event is usually accompanied with the flood duration less than 24 4 day confidence interval of 23 6 25 2 day similarly if flood volume is less than 17 6 103 m3 d s confidence interval of 10 2 25 4 103 m3 d s the bivariate risk of peak volume would not decrease significantly indicating that high peak flood event is usually accompanied with the flood volume less than 17 6 103 m3 d s confidence interval of 10 2 25 4 103 m3 d s fig 11 also shows relatively large uncertainties in each bivariate risk level take the plot of 50 year service scenario of peak volume as an example when the value of flood volume is 40 103 m3 d s the low and upper bounds of bivariate risk between flood peak and volume would be 56 7 and 60 7 respectively the ranges of confidence intervals for all peak volume scenarios are wider than peak duration scenarios the results are because of the uncertainty ranges in the joint distributions of peak volume and peak duration and the uncertainty range of peak volume is wider than peak duration as presented in fig 7 5 conclusions in this study a bayesian copula based frequency analysis bcfa method has been developed for supporting multivariate hydrological risk analysis under uncertainty through integrating the mcmc and copula functions into a general framework bcfa can help 1 characterize the multivariate properties of hydrological extreme events 2 infer posterior distributions of copula parameters with bayesian statistical inference which considers prior information and provides more reasonable values and confidence intervals of copula parameters 3 assess hydrological risk and their corresponding confidence intervals within multivariate context the developed bcfa has been applied to the snowmelt flood risk analysis of a real case study in the naryn river central asia where is a typical high mountain watershed with high frequency snowmelt flood compared with 8 parametric probabilistic distributions and 12 copula functions with different families weibull generalized pareto and pearson type iii would be better for quantifying the marginal distributions of peak duration and volume respectively clayton copula would be better for modeling the dependence of peak duration gaussian copula would be better for modeling the dependence of peak volume and duration volume some major findings can be summarized i the uncertainty range of joint distribution decreases along with flood variable value which would translate into conditional distribution joint return period and bivariate flood risk more attention should be paid to the lower value of flood variable to obtain precise flood risk assessment ii compared with the three flood pairs for different copula functions the uncertainty range of joint distribution is mainly influenced by the selection of copula functions iii in a same flood event the probability of both flood duration and flood volume reaching extreme large values is highest followed by peak volume and peak duration the probability of either flood peak or flood duration exceeding a certain threshold is highest followed by peak volume and duration volume iv high peak flows large than 1828 4 m3 s are usually accompanied with flood durations less than 24 4 day confidence interval of 23 6 25 2 day or flood volumes less than 17 6 103 m3 d s confidence interval of 10 2 25 4 103 m3 d s the above findings are helpful for i gaining insight into the relationships between multivariate flood variables ii providing decision support for flood control mitigation such as hydrological infrastructure design reservoir operation management and flood diversion measures this study is the first attempt to apply bcfa in multivariate flood risk assessment under uncertainty however there are also some potential extensions of the proposed method for example in this study bcfa has been used for reflecting multivariate flood characteristics and quantifying the uncertainty in dependence structure in fact the natural and anthropogenic processes e g climate change land use variation and human activity influence flood occurrence course which may result in some biased results in the flood risk assessment thus some robust approaches e g hydro climatological model are desired to be incorporated into bcfa to explore such influences in the future work declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have

5984,hydrology of forested wetlands is critical to the ecosystem functions and services of the forests our understanding of the hydrology of those wetlands however is very limited most likely due to the tediousness and costs of monitoring those scattered small wetlands by the traditional methods stable isotope ratios of oxygen δ18o and hydrogen δ2h in water may provide us a much simpler alternative to study the hydrology of those wetlands we investigated the sensitivity and resolution of using natural stable water isotopes to quantify the hydrology of those isolated wetlands in the forests of north florida the observed local meteoric water line lmwl δ2h 7 7 δ18o 9 2 r2 0 97 n 202 followed closely to the global meteoric water line gmwl indicating the local rains were formed following a general isotopic equilibrium condition using data collected between 2014 and 2017 we observed a negative linear correlation between monthly total rain and the weight of its isotopic signature there was no significant effect of temperature or humidity on the isotopic signatures of the rains the water isotopes of the ephemeral ponds and sinks on the other hand were significantly enriched relative to the precipitation the local evaporation lines lel of the studied ephemeral ponds and sinks indicated significant evaporation the isotope data indicated that the ephemeral pond 55 and pond 12 were rain fed while the water source to blue sink was a mixture of precipitation and groundwater we showed that the significant differences in stable water isotopic signatures among the precipitation especially during tropical storms and hurricanes surface water and ground water can be used to trace the hydrological budgets and processes of forested wetlands in north florida keywords isolated wetlands oxygen and hydrogen tracers hydrology 1 introduction the stable oxygen and hydrogen isotopes have been used extensively as conservative tracers in hydrological studies gremillion and wanielista 2000 for example they have been used to determine the sources of waters flow patterns and mixing of waters in different bodies of water e g katz and bullen 1996 araguás araguás et al 2000

been used as tracers to reconstruct continental paleoclimatology and paleohydrology e g rozanski et al 1992 koch et al 1995 seal and shanks 1998 baczynski et al 2017 on a global scale the average relationship between oxygen δ18o and hydrogen δ2h isotopic ratios in natural meteoric waters show a distinct empirical relationship that can be summed up by the following global meteoric water line or

regions e g prairie potholes playas vernal pools have received some attention in previous research but remains poorly understood zedler 2003 bauder 2005 brooks 2009 roznik et al 2009 it is recognized that these ephemeral systems particularly their water flow connectivity and ecology are as variable as their spatial distribution zedler 2003 brooks 2009 the water balances on these systems are likely highly variable over time due to the influence of evapotranspiration et and groundwater exchange hayashi and rosenberry 2002 in smaller scale forested ecosystems ephemeral wetlands like the prairie pothole wetlands likely shift from groundwater fed systems to primarily precipitation and surface runoff fed systems during most of growing season winter and rosenberry 1998 the hydrology of ephemeral wetlands has not been well described and their reliance on surface and subsurface water charging discharging requires further study especially in humid subtropical regions like the florida coastal plain region the influence of climate and the interaction between surface and subsurface sources and sinks on the ephemeral wetland hydroperiod period of inundation is of particular interest in this region there are still major gaps in the understanding related to the hydrological ecological and herpetological benefits services of these systems e g means 2008 greenberg et al 2015 chandler et al 2016 chandler et al 2017 means et al 2017 zhu et al 2017 our poor understanding of the hydrological budgets and processes in those isolated wetlands is most likely due to the tediousness and costly traditional monitoring methods isotopic tracer method however may provide a much simpler alternative for the study of hydrology in those wetlands with this in mind the primary goal of this research was to determine the sensitivity and resolution of the stable water isotopes as hydrological tracers for isolated forested wetlands in the region our hypothesis is that oxygen and hydrogen isotopes are sensitive tracers for quantifying hydrologic budget and processes of isolated wetlands in florida especially during hurricane and tropical storm situations here we present the isotopic data of precipitations surface water and soil pore water of the selected isolated wetlands in the apalachicola national forest anf and determined the significance and the optimal situations when those isotopic signals can be used to quantify the hydrologic processes of those wetlands 2 experimental 2 1 lake munson sandhills lms geology the study sites pond 55 pond 12 and blue sink fig 1 are located

prior to isotopic analysis samples were only collected during days when it was forecasted to rain at least 0 1 2 54 mm previous studies had shown that rainwater samples typically have d excess values greater than 0 so that any value below 0 is indicative of evaporation in the rain collectors or sampling containers welker 2000 harvey 2001 gammons et al 2006 sjostrom and welker 2009 in addition to the rainwater samples surface and soil pore water samples were also collected temporal surface waters were collected from pond 55 pond 12 and blue sink fig 1 depending on the forecasted rain we aimed to conduct the samplings so that we collected surface water samples before and right after a significant rain event surface waters were sampled by hand by first rinsing a 60 ml hdpe bottle with the water twice before collection bottles were filled to the brim tightly capped and transported to the laboratory and stored in the refrigerator prior to analysis to simulate the evaporation and contribution of rainwaters closed bottom open top pvc cylinders 38 54 h 15 cm d were installed at pond 55 and pond 12 at each site the pvc cylinder contained 8 l pond 55 and 5 l pond 12 of their respective surface waters both also contained onset hobo water loggers onset computer corporation bourne ma that recorded data at 10 min intervals water samples from the pvc experiments were collected almost at the same time as the pond water samples pvc water volume collected for each sampling was only 7 ml so it was a very small fraction relative to the total volume even with evaporation 0 2 collected pvc water samples were stored cold in 7 ml shell vials with closures kimble part number 60965d 1 the integrity of the vial stored sample with regards to evaporation was tested on triplicate tap water volumes 1 3 5 ml in the 7 ml shell vials which showed negligible evaporation effect 0 01 0 02 cv based on weight in a 77 hr storage experiment with the pvc the only water input and output are rain and evaporation respectively while for the pond they could be rain input evaporation output and something else overland flow shallow groundwater etc the similarity between the pond and pvc lels would indicate that rainfall and evaporation are the dominant input and output respectively soil pore water samples were collected at the upland forest near pond 55 when ground water table was higher than the surface water of the pond soil cores below the groundwater table interface were taken using soil augers in the laboratory porewater was collected immediately as free water that separated from the water saturated soil cores we used 1 ml plastic transfer pipets with bulbs for transferring porewater into shell vials or hdpe bottles these samples were processed similarly to the other water samples for isotope analysis a total of nine 9 soil pore water samples were taken from samplings conducted in april 2015 3 samples august 2016 3 and february 2017 3 2 4 isotope analysis water samples were prepared for isotope analysis by withdrawing a 5 10 ml aliquot using a syringe with a 0 45 μm filter attached to the tip approximately 1 ml of the filtered sample was poured directly into a 2 ml auto injector vial and closed with a septum cap samples were analyzed for δ18o and δ2h using a liquid water isotope analyzer lwia generation 2 abb los gatos research san jose ca with an attached auto injector for analysis the lwia gen2 uses off axis integrated cavity output spectroscopy oa icos to analyze the water isotopes e g baer et al 2002 sturm and knohl 2010 briefly the method measures the mixing ratios of three water isotopologues 1h16o1h 1h18o1h and 2h16o1h by scanning over three nearby absorption lines with similar line strengths and wavelength the beam of an infrared diode laser is directed off axis into an optical cavity resulting in an effective optical path length in the order of several kilometers and higher absorption signals sturm and knohl 2010 manufacturer supplied certified standard solutions with known δ18o and δ2h values were run after each set of five samples every vial containing either standard or sample was analyzed six times with means and standard deviations taken from the last four replicates this was done in order to eliminate carryover effects from the previous sample results were expressed in δ notation relative to vienna standard mean ocean water vsmow 1 δ r sample r standard 1 1000 where r 18o 16o or 2h 1h the more the negative the δ value the more depleted in either 18o or 2h the repeated measures error sd of this method is 0 3 and 2 for δ18o and δ2h respectively the oa icos method had been verified with the isotope ratio mass spectrometer method with very good comparability between the two e g lis et al 2008 penna et al 2010 berman et al 2013 2 5 evaporation experiments we also conducted a 14 day laboratory evaporation experiment using pond 55 natural surface waters glass beakers 250 ml were initially added with 200 g of water sample by weighing beakers were then left outside during the day to evaporate but were brought inside at the end of each day or when it rained at the end of each of day beakers were weighed subsampled one 7 ml sample per beaker and weighed again measured accumulated evaporative water loss was calculated as the difference in weight between the measured weight at that time point and the initial weight at the start of the experiment taking into account the amount of the subsample removed we assumed that the water density was 0 998 g ml at 22 c an overall cumulative water loss was calculated at the end of the experiment and the δ18o and δ2h values of all samples were determined 2 6 statistical treatment for the statistical treatment of data we utilized the ibm spss statistical package for the social sciences software armonk ny for performing comparison of means one way anova as related to temperature humidity rain amount and seasonality while correlations between parameters were analyzed using pearson s correlation one tailed at the 95 confidence level 3 results and discussion 3 1 isotopic composition of precipitation collected rainwater samples exhibited a range of δ18o 14 7 to 1 0 and δ2h values 108 to 11 5 table 1 rain samples with the most depleted isotope signals observed were associated with tropical storms and hurricanes that passed through the area water isotopes depleted to the narrow ranges of 14 3 to 14 7 δ18o and 107 3 to 107 8 δ2h during the hurricane hermine and tropical storm colin events which dropped at least 102 mm of rain each in the area this is similar to a number of studies that also showed more depleted δ18o signals from tropical storms and hurricanes e g gedzelman and lawrence 1982 gedzelman and lawrence 1990 lawrence 1998 lawrence et al 2002 good et al 2014 lane et al 2017 vieten et al 2018 lawrence et al 1998 noted that the low isotope ratios of rains in hurricanes is a consequence of their longevity size and high precipitation efficiency defined as the fraction of vapor that condenses and reaches the ground as precipitation the higher the precipitation efficiency the closer the rain δ18o approaches the more depleted δ18o of the source vapor for instance lawrence and gedzelman 1996 showed a 93 precipitation efficiency for tropical storms with a δ18o signature of 9 3 when compared to a mean source vapor δ18o signature of 12 2 the source of precipitation to the study area may change seasonally with convection style thunderstorms delivering rainfall during the summer months and with fall winter and spring rains being associated with frontal systems that are driven west to east by jet streams lambert and aharon 2010 sjostrom and welker 2009 observed that based on analysis of air mass back trajectory models central florida e g tampa could have four possible sources of rainfall gulf mid atlantic continental and pacific gulf sourced air masses are those that originated in the caribbean sea gulf of mexico or in the gulf coast region of the united states dominated during the spring and summer seasons 60 66 of total seasonal rain while continental and gulf derived precipitation 50 and 40 respectively dominated during the winter season continental derived air masses are such that originated and remained in the interior of the higher latitudes of north america without interacting with major western mountain ranges sjostrom and welker 2009 in general rain sources originating from high latitude area tended to be have more depleted δ18o and δ2h values and higher d excess values it has been reported that precipitation with d excess values greater than 15 strongly suggests input from continental sources harvey 2001 sjostrom and welker 2009 in this study we did not observe a statistically significantly seasonality in isotope values p 0 05 table 2 fig 3 except during the hurricane season when hurricanes and tropical storms contribute much depleted isotopic signals fig 3 as shown by the slash marked vertical bars data containing d excess values 15 represented only 13 4 of the total rainfall days which could imply a predominant gulf of mexico rain source throughout the year the lack of seasonality is also more expected in low latitudes like florida than those in mid or high latitudes dansgaard 1964 fricke and o neil 1999 sjostrom and welker 2009 no significant differences in isotopic signatures were observed among rains collected among pond 55 pond 12 and famu campus table 3 indicating not only a similar rain source but also an insignificant canopy effect p 0 05 the non location effect was expected because the three sampling sites are within a 10 km radius while the lack of canopy effect was most likely due to the fact that longleaf pine ecosystems generally consist of sparse to open canopies oswalt et al 2012 the rain δ18o and δ2h values from the three sites in tallahassee showed minimal evaporation based on the lmwls table 3 the lmwl from ne tallahassee area in particular showed no rainfall evaporation since most of the samples were taken during passage of a tropical storm concern had been warranted when we removed rainfall δ18o data with negative d excess values especially if these data were from sites with canopy cover e g allen et al 2017 gautam et al 2017 the excluded data in this study represented only 1 9 4 out of 206 data points of the total data with only one 1 data point out of 46 removed from pond 55 with forest canopy i e throughfall data and three 3 data points from famu site no canopy i e rainfall data we assumed that these outliers were due to post collection evaporation while the rainfall δ18o values were similar to the throughfall values in this study xu et al 2014 had shown that instead of values becoming more enriched due to evaporation throughfall δ18o values could also become more depleted combining all rain isotope data the tallahassee lmwl of δ2h 7 7 δ18o 9 2 r2 0 97 n 202 follows closely the global mean water line gmwl fig 4 indicating mostly isotopic equilibrium conditions during rain formation the slight deviation from the gmwl suggests a minimal evaporation effect during rainfall of event based samples the weighted rain δ18o and δ2h signatures for the entire data using online rainfall data are 5 1 and 30 2 respectively green star fig 4 odezulu 2011 previously collected δ18o and δ2h data from monthly accumulated rainfall from 2006 to 2009 in tallahassee that showed an lmwl of δ2h 8 1 δ18o 13 3 r2 0 98 n 43 table 4 similar to the gmwl wang et al 2018 studied the influence of heavy and small precipitation on lmwls by comparing event based and monthly weighted lmwls their study showed that the inclusion of rain isotope data from rainfalls 1 mm showed a statistically significant larger lmwl slope for weighted data however if only isotope data from 5 mm rains were used there was no significant difference between weighted and unweighted data wang et al 2018 in this study we only collected samples from rains that were 0 1 2 54 mm the two tallahassee lmwl data taken at different sampling periods may not be exactly the same but both did show similarity to the gmwl our data also agreed with data collected in south lido and tampa bay fl table 4 sjostrom and welker 2009 however at central ocala florida and other north florida e g marianna sites having similar humid subtropical climate classifications water isotopic data showed much lower lmwl slopes and hence significantly more evaporation of rains after they were formed despite similar time periods table 4 odezulu 2011 suggested that closer proximity of pensacola rainfall to its δ18o enriched source i e gulf of mexico resulted in less isotope fractionation compared to those observed in a more inland location like tallahassee previous studies on tropical low latitude precipitation have reported that higher rainfall amounts were generally inversely correlated with isotopic signals known as the amount effect dansgaard 1964 lawrence et al 1998 coplen et al 2000 in contrast permana et al 2016 suggested that rather than amount rain condensation mechanisms e g atmospheric temperature in high reaching clouds otte et al 2017 may have an equally if not greater influence on rainfall isotopic composition of tropical convective precipitation the fractionation and exchange process that were related to the amount effect were particularly important at the beginning of the shower or during a short shower before the air beneath the rain cloud becomes saturated and achieved isotopic equilibrium with the falling rain dansgaard 1964 hartley 1981 midwood et al 1998 this leads to relatively enriched precipitation during periods of light rain and a more depleted signature with prolonged rainfall midwood et al 1998 dogramaci et al 2012 a significant inverse correlation was observed in our study between δ18o and rainfall amount p 0 05 fig 5 using monthly weighted values and rainfall totals using data from one site i e famu campus similarly we also found significant inverse correlation between rainfall amount and monthly weighted δ2h p 0 05 our results showed that on average the precipitation δ18o and δ2h became depleted by 1 95 and 14 8 respectively for every 100 mm increased rainfall fig 5 lachniet and patterson 2009 had suggested that the smaller δ18o gradient 1 25 100 mm rainfall in northern central america and mexico was due to a smaller rainout fraction of air masses and that alternatively a larger gradient for a smaller rainout fraction may represent greater amounts of prior rainout upwind of the sampling locations 3 2 stable oxygen and hydrogen isotopes in soil pore waters and natural surface waters soil pore water had a much narrower δ18o range from 4 2 to 2 5 3 1 0 6 n 9 and δ2h from 18 3 to 7 0 14 0 3 2 n 9 mean sd represented as pink star fig 4 than those of the rains while more depleted δ18o values were observed in 2015 3 9 0 3 n 3 compared to either 2016 2 8 0 1 n 3 and 2017 2 7 0 2 n 3 there was no significant difference p 0 05 in δ2h values during the three years 2015 15 6 0 5 n 3 2016 15 6 2 4 n 3 2017 10 8 3 4 n 3 overall these δ18o values were slightly more enriched compared to the weighted mean rain δ18o value of 5 1 with a limestone geology and fast groundwater recharge the groundwater isotopic signature could be similar to the rainfall isotopic signature especially when rainfall exceeded 90 mm month govender et al 2013 the mean soil pore water isotope value obtained in this study was similar to those by katz 2001 which observed a mean wkp groundwater isotope δ18o and δ2h valuesof 3 8 0 4 n 11 and 19 7 2 8 n 11 respectively and that of a nearby wakulla springs δ18o 3 5 δ2h 18 4 the wakulla springs is one of the major springs in florida that discharges millions of gallons of water per day to the wakulla river katz 2001 further observed that the wkp groundwater δ18o δ 2h data showed a regression line slope δ2h 6 2 δ18o 3 9 r2 0 90 n 11 which indicated isotope enrichment relative to either the gmwl or the lmwl temporal ambient surface water samples were collected from pond 55 pond 12 and blue sink from 2014 to 2017 overall the range of isotope values was from 2 to 4 2 for δ18o and from 24 3 to 16 4 for δ2h table 5 lower 10 or negative d excess values in the ponds compared to precipitation indicate fractionation effects due to evaporation as observed by other studies e g reckerth et al 2017 seasonality in isotopic signatures were not observed in either pond 55 or blue sink p 0 05 observed slopes of the δ18o δ2h regression line between 4 5 and 5 6 indicated that overall the natural surface waters in the area were significantly evaporated table 6 rain and groundwater are potential sources of natural surface waters within the anf based on water table changes and measurements of ph and alkalinity it was speculated by milla et al in odezulu 2011 that the water of a nearby ephemeral anf pond 1 was mostly rain derived while that of blue sink was a mixture of rainwater and groundwater based on our isotopic data table 6 the measured lmwl and the pond 55 δ18o δ2h regression line intersect at the point of 5 7 δ18o and 34 7 δ2h these values are similar to that of the mean weighted rain isotope values of 5 1 δ18o and 30 2 δ2h our isotopic results confirm that the source of the surface water in pond 55 was indeed mostly from rain on the other hand the lmwl and the blue sink δ18o δ2h regression line intersected at the point of 4 3 δ18o and 24 0 δ2h which were more enriched than the mean rainwater isotope values indicating another possible water source other than the local rains 3 3 sensitivity of using isotopes as tracers to quantify hydrology of the wetlands this study shows that the difference in isotopic signature between the rain and the surface water was significant and could be used to trace the contribution of a rain to the surface water of a wetland especially during tropical storms and hurricanes tables 1 and 5 for example the rain carried by the tropical storm colin had mean δ18o and δ2h of 12 5 and 92 9 respectively the surface water of pond 55 had mean δ18o and δ2h of 0 7 min 2 and max 3 9 and 2 3 min 24 3 and max 12 0 respectively during the study period the minimum and maximum combined δ18o and δ2h isotopic differences on a δ18o and δ2h plot between tropical storm colin and the pond 55 surface water were 69 4 and 106 2 respectively the combined error of the δ18o and δ2h plot was about 2 the uncertainty of using the isotopic signals to trace the contribution of the tropical storm colin rain to the surface water of pond 55 would be in a range between 1 9 and 2 9 of the total surface water volume in other words the contribution of the tropical storm colin to the surface water of pond 55 can be sensitively quantified using the isotopic signals with the resolution of 1 9 2 9 of the total surface water volume similar analysis for the blue sink indicated the resolution of rain water contribution from tropical storm colin to be in the range between 2 0 and 2 5 of the total surface water volume in case of the hurricane hermine event the resolution of rain water contribution to pond 55 would be in a range between 2 3 and 4 1 of the total surface water volume and that of the blue sink would be between 2 6 and 3 3 of the total surface water volume the surface water volumes of those wetlands are relatively small in which the increase of the surface water during a storm could easily exceed 10 of the total water volume the rainfall contribution to the pond 55 during the category 1 hurricane hermine was 38 3 according to the isotopic signals while tropical storms and hurricanes like colin and hermine provide us with most desirable opportunities to trace the hydrology of those wetlands other rains also may provide good opportunities as well we used the most and least depleted rains other than tropical storms and hurricanes to calculate the uncertainty resolution of rain water contribution to the surface water of those wetlands the results showed that in case of pond 55 the resolution ranged from 4 6 to 30 0 of the total surface water volume and in case of the blue sink it ranged from 5 7 to 11 3 of the total surface water volume in the case of tropical storm cindy the resolution of rain contribution to pond 55 and blue sink total surface water volumes ranged 5 2 65 2 and 6 6 15 5 respectively the much higher maximum uncertainty 65 2 could still occur especially when preceded by other tropical storms or hurricanes these results show that not all rain events were suitable for the tracer approach but many heavier rain events were the estimated contribution of the rain water to the surface water of the wetlands by the isotopic method are all in relative terms i e of the total water volume and applicable to only a specific rain event we can convert those increase in water volumes to the absolute water storage of the pond however by the following strategy first we need to construct the water depth vs surface area relationship by topographic contour plot and surface water area vs water depth to a reference point measurements then we can convert the surface water area vs water depth relationship to a delta water volume increase vs water depth to the reference level increase relationship with this delta water volume increase vs water depth to the reference level increase information we can identify the corresponding water volume increase by the isotopic method during a runoff event and calculate the absolute water volume of the pond at that water depth to the reference level we then have a very convenient means to know the absolute water storage of the pond at any given time by just knowing the water depth to the reference level of a pond at that time monitoring changes in surface water depth to the reference level then becomes a convenient way to quantify hydrologic parameters of the drainage area around the wetland such as runoff precipitation ratio charge discharge rates of the wetland evapotranspiration rate of the drainage area and evaporation rate of the surface water 3 4 evaporation extent of isolated forested wetlands isotopic enrichment of a water body relative to its potential sources is an indication of evaporation assuming isotopic equilibrium between the liquid and vapor phases the degree of primary evaporation of the water body at a given temperature and humidity can be calculated using the craig gordon c g model gonfiantini 1986 majoube 1971 clark and fritz 1997 murad and krishnamurthy 2008 2 δ o h ε total o h ln f rw ε w v ε v bl ln f rw 3 δ δ o δ i ε w v ε v bl ln f rw 4 f rw e δ εtotal 5 f ev 1 f rw where δ o h is the difference in δ18o or δ2h of the original unevaporated source water subscript o and temporal water body subscript i frw and fev are the remaining and evaporated water fractions respectively the isotope signatures of the original unevaporated water source can be calculated from the intersection of the lmwl and lel assuming a single source of water while evaporative water loss can be calculated from eqns 2 9 also see below the term εtotal o h represents the equilibrium and kinetic fractionations of the o and h isotopes at the water vapor w v and evaporation i e vapor boundary layer v bl interfaces respectively and are calculated using the following equations gonfiantini 1986 majoube 1971 araguás araguás et al 2000 for 18 o ε w v 1 137 10 6 t 2 0 4156 10 3 t 2 0667

day temperature and humidity values taken from online meteorological data were used in the calculations benettin et al 2018 argued that not all δ18o δ2h regression lines from soil pore waters and xylem waters can be called lels due to possible multiple sources of waters for ponds 55 and 12 and other ponds that are derived from a single source of water we can use the above equations to calculate their possible evaporative losses isotope data along the pond 55 lel represented calculated evaporative losses that ranged from 20 to 48 with a mean of 35 3 7 3 n 72 fig 6 during the study period on the other hand mean evaporative loss at pond 12 was 46 9 7 3 n 34 fig 6 during the study period pond 12 has much shallower profile and larger surface depth ratio than pond 55 which explains the more significant evaporation observed in the surface water according to previous studies the evaporative enrichment is a dominant factor in the isotope balance of closed or lentic hydrological systems such as lakes and wetlands e g krabbenhoft et al 1990 meyers et al 1993 saxena 1996 gremillion and wanielista 2000 marimuthu et al 2005 with the isotope repeated measurement error of 0 3 and 2 for δ18o and δ2h respectively uncertainties in evaporative loss measurements can be calculated from isotope gradient evaporative loss and the repeated measurement error evaporative loss measurement uncertainty evaporation loss 0 3 for δ18o or 2 for δ2h isotope gradient low calculated evaporative loss measurement with uncertainties of 1 8 0 2 for δ18o based and 2 0 0 2 δ2h based gave good confidence to the estimated evaporative losses of the two ponds as long as the latter values are significantly above the measurement uncertainties for pond 55 the passage of hurricane hermine followed by a prolonged dry period 85 days gave us an opportunity to estimate the extent of evaporation during the dry period with the pond 55 lel being δ2h 5 2 δ18o 13 7 r2 0 98 n 8 the intersection of this lel with the lmwl is at 9 2 and 61 3 for δ18o and δ2h respectively we sampled the water between the 15th and 85th days after the hurricane evaporative loss during the 70 day dry period caused the δ18o and δ2h of pond 55 surface water to be enriched by 3 7 and 16 2 respectively fig 7 the evaporation loss was calculated to be 20 5 3 5 of the original surface water volume the isotope data for pond 12 on the other hand encompassed the 46 dry days between water samplings which showed δ18o and δ2h enrichments to be 1 5 and 10 8 respectively fig 7 the evaporation loss over the 46 day dry period was calculated to be 11 3 0 4 of the original surface water unlike the cases of the rainwater fed pond 55 and 12 blue sink had the mixed contribution of rain and groundwater whose isotopic signature was unknown the evaporation of the blue sink therefore cannot be deduced similarly from the lel however the blue sink lel during this extended dry period δ2h 5 9 δ18o 7 5 r2 0 93 n 8 intersected the lmwl at δ18o 9 3 and δ2h 62 2 very similar to that of the pond 55 δ18o 9 2 and δ2h 61 3 and close to the signals of the hurricane hermine rainfall δ18o 11 1 3 1 and δ2h 80 4 25 9 n 7 we therefore suspect that the rainwater of hurricane hermine probably contributed to the majority of the surface water both in pond 55 and blue sink right after the event with that assumption we estimated the evaporation loss of the blue sink during the 70 day dry period to be 13 1 0 2 blue sink 18o and 2h enrichments reached 1 9 and 12 0 respectively fig 7 in the laboratory the 14 day beaker evaporation experiment using pond 55 waters yielded a total accumulated evaporative loss of 57 5 1 3 with an accompanying 5 0 and 27 6 enrichment of the 18o and 2h isotopes respectively we observed a significant direct correlation between the measured laboratory beaker evaporation losses and those calculated using the c g model fig 8 p 0 05 other pan evaporation rate studies e g gibson et al 1999 van den akker et al 2011 have reported results with high direct regression coefficients r2 0 9 and with mostly 1 1 correlations between their measured and theoretical values this is in contrast to our study in which laboratory measured values were much higher than those that were calculated fig 8 as other studies had pointed out small drying pans 1 l are oversensitive to atmospheric conditions and provide information that is less hydrologically useful e g welhan and fritz 1977 gonfiantini 1986 gibson et al 1999 however even with the small drying pan size the 2 week laboratory experiment still demonstrated a pond 55 evaporation line of δ2h 5 3 δ18o 6 2 r2 0 99 n 5 that was similar to the measured lel δ2h 5 1 δ18o 5 7 r2 0 63 n 72 table 6 furthermore the closed bottom pvc set up installed upslope of pond 55 also showed a similar lel δ2h 5 5 δ18o 4 8 r2 0 80 n 57 gibson and reid 2014 also reported evaporation pan δ18o and δ2h values were similar to the lake isotope values pond 12 another isolated wetland in our study area also showed similar lels between its natural surface waters δ2h 5 6 δ18o 5 6 r2 0 77 n 34 table 6 and pvc counterpart δ2h 5 4 δ18o 4 3 r2 0 90 n 16 the lel comparison of waters from pond 55 and the pvc and beaker experiments suggest that in a hydrological system in which precipitation and evaporation serve as the dominant inflow and outflow conduits such as isolated wetlands the isotopic signature of water can serve as a powerful tracer for studying the water balance due to evaporation we believe that the results we had obtained from this study can be applied to the similar isolated wetlands in the apalachicola national forest and other humid subtropical regions while not a subject of this research the use of the water isotope tracer techniques could also be applied to study the hydrological processes of other isolated palustrine systems such as those dominated by and have more than 50 areal coverage of deciduous trees and shrubs national wetlands inventory accessed 27 oct 2019 this study confirms the sensitivity of the approach and gives us a valuable guidance to our subsequent study of the hydrology in those isolated wetlands in the region 4 conclusion this study has documented the stable isotope signals of the rain the soil pore water and the surface water of the study area the results show the sensitivity and resolution of using the stable isotopic signals to quantify the hydrology of those wetlands the measured local meteoric water line follows closely the global meteoric water line indicating minimal evaporation during rainfall we observed no significant correlations between isotopic signatures with either temperature or relative humidity there was lacking seasonality in the isotopic signatures except during the hurricane season when hurricanes and tropical storms contribute much depleted isotopic signals we did observe a significant inverse correlation between isotopes and rainfall amount we were able to show that the ephemeral ponds pond 55 and pond 12 were mainly derived from rain water and that the blue sink has water source other than rain water this study shows that the δ18o and δ2h of rains especially heavier rains were significantly depleted in comparison to those of the surface water of the wetlands those significant differences in stable isotopic signals can be used to trace the contribution of rain water to the surface water the sources of surface water and the extent of surface evaporation of those wetlands the stable isotope tracers can be a powerful and much simpler tool

5984,hydrology of forested wetlands is critical to the ecosystem functions and services of the forests our understanding of the hydrology of those wetlands however is very limited most likely due to the tediousness and costs of monitoring those scattered small wetlands by the traditional methods stable isotope ratios of oxygen δ18o and hydrogen δ2h in water may provide us a much simpler alternative to study the hydrology of those wetlands we investigated the sensitivity and resolution of using natural stable water isotopes to quantify the hydrology of those isolated wetlands in the forests of north florida the observed local meteoric water line lmwl δ2h 7 7 δ18o 9 2 r2 0 97 n 202 followed closely to the global meteoric water line gmwl indicating the local rains were formed following a general isotopic equilibrium condition using data collected between 2014 and 2017 we observed a negative linear correlation between monthly total rain and the weight of its isotopic signature there was no significant effect of temperature or humidity on the isotopic signatures of the rains the water isotopes of the ephemeral ponds and sinks on the other hand were significantly enriched relative to the precipitation the local evaporation lines lel of the studied ephemeral ponds and sinks indicated significant evaporation the isotope data indicated that the ephemeral pond 55 and pond 12 were rain fed while the water source to blue sink was a mixture of precipitation and groundwater we showed that the significant differences in stable water isotopic signatures among the precipitation especially during tropical storms and hurricanes surface water and ground water can be used to trace the hydrological budgets and processes of forested wetlands in north florida keywords isolated wetlands oxygen and hydrogen tracers hydrology 1 introduction the stable oxygen and hydrogen isotopes have been used extensively as conservative tracers in hydrological studies gremillion and wanielista 2000 for example they have been used to determine the sources of waters flow patterns and mixing of waters in different bodies of water e g katz and bullen 1996 araguás araguás et al 2000 gremillion and wanielista 2000 furthermore through changes of its isotope composition within the water cycle the water can be related to the different phases of the cycle gat 1996 isotope have also been used as tracers to reconstruct continental paleoclimatology and paleohydrology e g rozanski et al 1992 koch et al 1995 seal and shanks 1998 baczynski et al 2017 on a global scale the average relationship between oxygen δ18o and hydrogen δ2h isotopic ratios in natural meteoric waters show a distinct empirical relationship that can be summed up by the following global meteoric water line or

et al 2012 ephemeral ponds are isolated and seasonal wetland systems i e depressions that remain inundated for extended periods during a given year but may dry out completely means 2008 they occur in most regions throughout the world and are often found in the southeastern us coastal plain tiner 2003 zedler 2003 brooks 2009 the dynamics of ephemeral wetlands and their counterparts in various regions e g prairie potholes playas vernal pools have received some attention in previous research but remains poorly understood zedler 2003 bauder 2005 brooks 2009 roznik et al 2009 it is recognized that these ephemeral systems particularly their water flow connectivity and ecology are as variable as their spatial distribution zedler 2003 brooks 2009 the water balances on these systems are likely highly variable over time due to the influence of evapotranspiration et and groundwater exchange hayashi and rosenberry 2002 in smaller scale forested ecosystems ephemeral wetlands like the prairie pothole wetlands likely shift from groundwater fed systems to primarily precipitation and surface runoff fed systems during most of growing season winter and rosenberry 1998 the hydrology of ephemeral wetlands has not been well described and their reliance on surface and subsurface water charging discharging requires further study especially in humid subtropical regions like the florida coastal plain region the influence of climate and the interaction between surface and subsurface sources and sinks on the ephemeral wetland hydroperiod period of inundation is of particular interest in this region there are still major gaps in the understanding related to the hydrological ecological and herpetological benefits services of these systems e g means 2008 greenberg et al 2015 chandler et al 2016 chandler et al 2017 means et al 2017 zhu et al 2017 our poor understanding of the hydrological budgets and processes in those isolated wetlands is most likely due to the tediousness and costly traditional monitoring methods isotopic tracer method however may provide a much simpler alternative for the study of hydrology in those wetlands with this in mind the primary goal of this research was to determine the sensitivity and resolution of the stable water isotopes as hydrological tracers for isolated forested wetlands in the region our hypothesis is that oxygen and hydrogen isotopes are sensitive tracers for quantifying hydrologic budget and processes of isolated wetlands in florida especially during hurricane and tropical storm situations here we present the isotopic data of precipitations surface water and soil pore water of the selected isolated wetlands in the apalachicola national forest anf and determined the significance and the optimal situations when those isotopic signals can be used to quantify the hydrologic processes of those wetlands 2 experimental 2 1 lake munson sandhills lms geology the study sites pond 55 pond 12 and blue sink fig 1 are located within the leon county fl lms region at the western edge of the woodville karst plain wkp hendry and sproul 1966 pond 55 and pond 12 are among at least 200 similar isolated forested wetland ponds in

the wkp is characterized by a thin veneer of unconsolidated and undifferentiated pleistocene quartz sands and shell beds overlying oligocene and miocene age limestones hendry and sproul 1966 rupert 1988 katz 2001 kincaid and werner 2008 porous and permeable veneering sands allow rainwater to rapidly move into the underlying limestone strata that make up the upper floridan aquifer ufa groundwaters from the ufa is the source of water supply for the nearest city tallahassee and for parts of the surrounding areas davis 1996 the underlying limestones are very soluble and have undergone considerable solution by the action of these percolating groundwaters as a result the area has been continuously and rapidly lowered from original level and is presently covered with sinks that appear as shallow sand filled depressions hendry and sproul 1966 katz 2001 the lms region of the apalachicola national forest near tallahassee fl is specifically dotted with by numerous shallow depressions that represent karst features at depth mantled by overlying sands silts and clays hendry and sproul 1966 while the wkp allows for a rapid groundwater recharge the silts and clays of the adjoining apalachicola coastal lowlands interfinger with the sands of the lms region resulting in poorer permeability more restricted downward percolation of the groundwater less solution of the limestone bedrock and therefore minimal change from the original depositional surface and elevation of the wkp hendry and sproul 1966 many of the shallow depressions in the lms region are seasonally filled with

from sail high weatherstem station tallahassee fl https leon weatherstem com was used as a data source since it is one of the nearest weather stations with data dating back to at least 2014 the station is located within a 10 km radius from the study sites during the sampling period three named storms passed through the area tropical storm colin and category 1 hurricane hermine in 2016 both of which caused direct impacts and tropical storm cindy in 2017 which contributed heavy rainfall to the leon county area according to the köppen climate classification north florida s humid subtropical climate is characterized by hot and humid summers and mild to chilly winters peel et al 2007 the colder months are normally from december to february while the hotter months are from may

were generally 10 15 c higher than in winter 14 c fig 2 a during the 3 year sampling period mean monthly humidity values ranged between 71 and 82 fig 2b the meteorological data also showed higher total rainfall amounts during the summer fig 2c and lower amounts during the fall and spring months generally following the trend of normal monthly rainfall amounts for tallahassee fl https climatecenter fsu edu products services data 1981 2010 normals tallahassee based on the online data 8 9 27 1 and 64 of the 1 204 study period days could be classified as heavy rain experiencing 30 mm hr rain intensities light medium rain 30 mm hr intensities and dry days respectively the heavy rain days while few accounted for 69 5 of the total recorded precipitation 3780 mm rain 2 3 water sampling samples from more than 126 rain events were collected from november 2014 to august 2017 at the florida a m university famu campus the tallahassee international airport and the northeastern ne part of tallahassee fl rainwater samples were also collected at pond 55 fig 1 from april 2015 to may 2017 and at pond 12 fig 1 from april 2015 to november 2015 respectively water samples were collected using rain collectors consisting of a high density polyethylene hdpe bottle with a funnel placed on top these rain collectors were placed under a forest canopy at pond 55 under a less dense canopy at pond 12 and under no cover at the famu campus immediately after each event collected rain water samples were transferred to 60 ml hdpe bottles tightly capped and stored in a refrigerator prior to isotopic analysis samples were only collected during days when it was forecasted to rain at least 0 1 2 54 mm previous studies had shown that rainwater samples typically have d excess values greater than 0 so that any value below 0 is indicative of evaporation in the rain collectors or sampling containers welker 2000 harvey 2001 gammons et al 2006 sjostrom and welker 2009 in addition to the rainwater samples surface and soil pore water samples were also collected temporal surface waters were collected from pond 55 pond 12 and blue sink fig 1 depending on the forecasted rain we aimed to conduct the samplings so that we collected surface water samples before and right after a significant rain event surface waters were sampled by hand by first rinsing a 60 ml hdpe bottle with the water twice before collection bottles were filled to the brim tightly capped and transported to the laboratory and stored in the refrigerator prior to analysis to simulate the evaporation and contribution of rainwaters closed bottom open top pvc cylinders 38 54 h 15 cm d were installed at pond 55 and pond 12 at each site the pvc cylinder contained 8 l pond 55 and 5 l pond 12 of their respective surface waters both also contained onset hobo water loggers onset computer corporation bourne ma that recorded data at 10 min intervals water samples from the pvc experiments were collected almost at the same time as the pond water samples pvc water volume collected for each sampling was only 7 ml so it was a very small fraction relative to the total volume even with evaporation 0 2 collected pvc water samples were stored cold in 7 ml shell vials with closures kimble part number 60965d 1 the integrity of the vial stored sample with regards to evaporation was tested on triplicate tap water volumes 1 3 5 ml in the 7 ml shell vials which showed negligible evaporation effect 0 01 0 02 cv based on weight in a 77 hr storage experiment with the pvc the only water input and output are rain and evaporation respectively while for the pond they could be rain input evaporation output and something else overland flow shallow groundwater etc the similarity between the pond and pvc lels would indicate that rainfall and evaporation are the dominant input and output respectively soil pore water samples were collected at the upland forest near pond 55 when ground water table was higher than the surface water of the pond soil cores below the groundwater table interface were taken using soil augers in the laboratory porewater was collected immediately as free water that separated from the water saturated soil cores we used 1 ml plastic transfer pipets with bulbs for transferring porewater into shell vials or hdpe bottles these samples were processed similarly to the other water samples for isotope analysis a total of nine 9 soil pore water samples were taken from samplings conducted in april 2015 3 samples august 2016 3 and february 2017 3 2 4 isotope analysis water samples were prepared for isotope analysis by withdrawing a 5 10 ml aliquot using a syringe with a 0 45 μm filter attached to the tip approximately 1 ml of the filtered sample was poured directly into a 2 ml auto injector vial and closed with a septum cap samples were analyzed for δ18o and δ2h using a liquid water isotope analyzer lwia generation 2 abb los gatos research san jose ca with an attached auto injector for analysis the lwia gen2 uses off axis integrated cavity output spectroscopy oa icos to analyze the water isotopes e g baer et al 2002 sturm and knohl 2010 briefly the method measures the mixing ratios of three water isotopologues 1h16o1h 1h18o1h and 2h16o1h by scanning over three nearby absorption lines with similar line strengths and wavelength the beam of an infrared diode laser is directed off axis into an optical cavity resulting in an effective optical path length in the order of several kilometers and higher absorption signals sturm and knohl 2010 manufacturer supplied certified standard solutions with known δ18o and δ2h values were run after each set of five samples every vial containing either standard or sample was analyzed six times with means and standard deviations taken from the last four replicates this was done in order to eliminate carryover effects from the previous sample results were expressed in δ notation relative to vienna standard mean ocean water vsmow 1 δ r sample r standard 1 1000 where r 18o 16o or 2h 1h the more the negative the δ value the more depleted in either 18o or 2h the repeated measures error sd of this method is 0 3 and 2 for δ18o and δ2h respectively the oa icos method had been verified with the isotope ratio mass spectrometer method with very good comparability between the two e g lis et al 2008 penna et al 2010 berman et al 2013 2 5 evaporation experiments we also conducted a 14 day laboratory evaporation experiment using pond 55 natural surface waters glass beakers 250 ml were initially added with 200 g of water sample by weighing beakers were then left outside during the day to evaporate but were brought inside at the end of each day or when it rained at the end of each of day beakers were weighed subsampled one 7 ml sample per beaker and weighed again measured accumulated evaporative water loss was calculated as the difference in weight between the measured weight at that time point and the initial weight at the start of the experiment taking into account the amount of the subsample removed we assumed that the water density was 0 998 g ml at 22 c an overall cumulative water loss was calculated at the end of the experiment and the δ18o and δ2h values of all samples were determined 2 6 statistical treatment for the statistical treatment of data we utilized the ibm spss statistical package for the social sciences software armonk ny for performing comparison of means one way anova as related to temperature humidity rain amount and seasonality while correlations between parameters were analyzed using pearson s correlation one tailed at the 95 confidence level 3 results and discussion 3 1 isotopic composition of precipitation collected rainwater samples exhibited a range of δ18o 14 7 to 1 0 and δ2h values 108 to 11 5 table 1 rain samples with the most depleted isotope signals observed were associated with tropical storms and hurricanes that passed through the area water isotopes depleted to the narrow ranges of 14 3 to 14 7 δ18o and 107 3 to 107 8 δ2h during the hurricane hermine and tropical storm colin events which dropped at least 102 mm of rain each in the area this is similar to a number of studies that also showed more depleted δ18o signals from tropical storms and hurricanes e g gedzelman and lawrence 1982 gedzelman and lawrence 1990 lawrence 1998 lawrence et al 2002 good et al 2014 lane et al 2017 vieten et al 2018 lawrence et al 1998 noted that the low isotope ratios of rains in hurricanes is a consequence of their longevity size and high precipitation efficiency defined as the fraction of vapor that condenses and reaches the ground as precipitation the higher the precipitation efficiency the closer the rain δ18o approaches the more depleted δ18o of the source vapor for instance lawrence and gedzelman 1996 showed a 93 precipitation efficiency for tropical storms with a δ18o signature of 9 3 when compared to a mean source vapor δ18o signature of 12 2 the source of precipitation to the study area may change seasonally with convection style thunderstorms delivering rainfall during the summer months and with fall winter and spring rains being associated with frontal systems that are driven west to east by jet streams lambert and aharon 2010 sjostrom and welker 2009 observed that based on analysis of air mass back trajectory models central florida e g tampa could have four possible sources of rainfall gulf mid atlantic continental and pacific gulf sourced air masses are those that originated in the caribbean sea gulf of mexico or in the gulf coast region of the united states dominated during the spring and summer seasons 60 66 of total seasonal rain while continental and gulf derived precipitation 50 and 40 respectively dominated during the winter season continental derived air masses are such that originated and remained in the interior of the higher latitudes of north america without interacting with major western mountain ranges sjostrom and welker 2009 in general rain sources originating from high latitude area tended to be have more depleted δ18o and δ2h values and higher d excess values it has been reported that precipitation with d excess values greater than 15 strongly suggests input from continental sources harvey 2001 sjostrom and welker 2009 in this study we did not observe a statistically significantly seasonality in isotope values p 0 05 table 2 fig 3 except during the hurricane season when hurricanes and tropical storms contribute much depleted isotopic signals fig 3 as shown by the slash marked vertical bars data containing d excess values 15 represented only 13 4 of the total rainfall days which could imply a predominant gulf of mexico rain source throughout the year the lack of seasonality is also more expected in low latitudes like florida than those in mid or high latitudes dansgaard 1964 fricke and o neil 1999 sjostrom and welker 2009 no significant differences in isotopic signatures were observed among rains collected among pond 55 pond 12 and famu campus table 3 indicating not only a similar rain source but also an insignificant canopy effect p 0 05 the non location effect was expected because the three sampling sites are within a 10 km radius while the lack of canopy effect was most likely due to the fact that longleaf pine ecosystems generally consist of sparse to open canopies oswalt et al 2012 the rain δ18o and δ2h values from the three sites in tallahassee showed minimal evaporation based on the lmwls table 3 the lmwl from ne tallahassee area in particular showed no rainfall evaporation since most of the samples were taken during passage of a tropical storm concern had been warranted when we removed rainfall δ18o data with negative d excess values especially if these data were from sites with canopy cover e g allen et al 2017 gautam et al 2017 the excluded data in this study represented only 1 9 4 out of 206 data points of the total data with only one 1 data point out of 46 removed from pond 55 with forest canopy i e throughfall data and three 3 data points from famu site no canopy i e rainfall data we assumed that these outliers were due to post collection evaporation while the rainfall δ18o values were similar to the throughfall values in this study xu et al 2014 had shown that instead of values becoming more enriched due to evaporation throughfall δ18o values could also become more depleted combining all rain isotope data the tallahassee lmwl of δ2h 7 7 δ18o 9 2 r2 0 97 n 202 follows closely the global mean water line gmwl fig 4 indicating mostly isotopic equilibrium conditions during rain formation the slight deviation from the gmwl suggests a minimal evaporation effect during rainfall of event based samples the weighted rain δ18o and δ2h signatures for the entire data using online rainfall data are 5 1 and 30 2 respectively green star fig 4 odezulu 2011 previously collected δ18o and δ2h data from monthly accumulated rainfall from 2006 to 2009 in tallahassee that showed an lmwl of δ2h 8 1 δ18o 13 3 r2 0 98 n 43 table 4 similar to the gmwl wang et al 2018 studied the influence of heavy and small precipitation on lmwls by comparing event based and monthly weighted lmwls their study showed that the inclusion of rain isotope data from rainfalls 1 mm showed a statistically significant larger lmwl slope for weighted data however if only isotope data from 5 mm rains were used there was no significant difference between weighted and unweighted data wang et al 2018 in this study we only collected samples from rains that were 0 1 2 54 mm the two tallahassee lmwl data taken at different sampling periods may not be exactly the same but both did show similarity to the gmwl our data also agreed with data collected in south lido and tampa bay fl table 4 sjostrom and welker 2009 however at central ocala florida and other north florida e g marianna sites having similar humid subtropical climate classifications water isotopic data showed much lower lmwl slopes and hence significantly more evaporation of rains after they were formed despite similar time periods table 4 odezulu 2011 suggested that closer proximity of pensacola rainfall to its δ18o enriched source i e gulf of mexico resulted in less isotope fractionation compared to those observed in a more inland location like tallahassee previous studies on tropical low latitude precipitation have reported that higher rainfall amounts were generally inversely correlated with isotopic signals known as the amount effect dansgaard 1964 lawrence et al 1998 coplen et al 2000 in contrast permana et al 2016 suggested that rather than amount rain condensation mechanisms e g atmospheric temperature in high reaching clouds otte et al 2017 may have an equally if not greater influence on rainfall isotopic composition of tropical convective precipitation the fractionation and exchange process that were related to the amount effect were particularly important at the beginning of the shower or during a short shower before the air beneath the rain cloud becomes saturated and achieved isotopic equilibrium with the falling rain dansgaard 1964 hartley 1981 midwood et al 1998 this leads to relatively enriched precipitation during periods of light rain and a more depleted signature with prolonged rainfall midwood et al 1998 dogramaci et al 2012 a significant inverse correlation was observed in our study between δ18o and rainfall amount p 0 05 fig 5 using monthly weighted values and rainfall totals using data from one site i e famu campus similarly we also found significant inverse correlation between rainfall amount and monthly weighted δ2h p 0 05 our results showed that on average the precipitation δ18o and δ2h became depleted by 1 95 and 14 8 respectively for every 100 mm increased rainfall fig 5 lachniet and patterson 2009 had suggested that the smaller δ18o gradient 1 25 100 mm rainfall in northern central america and mexico was due to a smaller rainout fraction of air masses and that alternatively a larger gradient for a smaller rainout fraction may represent greater amounts of prior rainout upwind of the sampling locations 3 2 stable oxygen and hydrogen isotopes in soil pore waters and natural surface waters soil pore water had a much narrower δ18o range from 4 2 to 2 5 3 1 0 6 n 9 and δ2h from 18 3 to 7 0 14 0 3 2 n 9 mean sd represented as pink star fig 4 than those of the rains while more depleted δ18o values were observed in 2015 3 9 0 3 n 3 compared to either 2016 2 8 0 1 n 3 and 2017 2 7 0 2 n 3 there was no significant difference p 0 05 in δ2h values during the three years 2015 15 6 0 5 n 3 2016 15 6 2 4 n 3 2017 10 8 3 4 n 3 overall these δ18o values were slightly more enriched compared to the weighted mean rain δ18o value of 5 1 with a limestone geology and fast groundwater recharge the groundwater isotopic signature could be similar to the rainfall isotopic signature especially when rainfall exceeded 90 mm month govender et al 2013 the mean soil pore water isotope value obtained in this study was similar to those by katz 2001 which observed a mean wkp groundwater isotope δ18o and δ2h valuesof 3 8 0 4 n 11 and 19 7 2 8 n 11 respectively and that of a nearby wakulla springs δ18o 3 5 δ2h 18 4 the wakulla springs is one of the major springs in florida that discharges millions of gallons of water per day to the wakulla river katz 2001 further observed that the wkp groundwater δ18o δ 2h data showed a regression line slope δ2h 6 2 δ18o 3 9 r2 0 90 n 11 which indicated isotope enrichment relative to either the gmwl or the lmwl temporal ambient surface water samples were collected from pond 55 pond 12 and blue sink from 2014 to 2017 overall the range of isotope values was from 2 to 4 2 for δ18o and from 24 3 to 16 4 for δ2h table 5 lower 10 or negative d excess values in the ponds compared to precipitation indicate fractionation effects due to evaporation as observed by other studies e g reckerth et al 2017 seasonality in isotopic signatures were not observed in either pond 55 or blue sink p 0 05 observed slopes of the δ18o δ2h regression line between 4 5 and 5 6 indicated that overall the natural surface waters in the area were significantly evaporated table 6 rain and groundwater are potential sources of natural surface waters within the anf based on water table changes and measurements of ph and alkalinity it was speculated by milla et al in odezulu 2011 that the water of a nearby ephemeral anf pond 1 was mostly rain derived while that of blue sink was a mixture of rainwater and groundwater based on our isotopic data table 6 the measured lmwl and the pond 55 δ18o δ2h regression line intersect at the point of 5 7 δ18o and 34 7 δ2h these values are similar to that of the mean weighted rain isotope values of 5 1 δ18o and 30 2 δ2h our isotopic results confirm that the source of the surface water in pond 55 was indeed mostly from rain on the other hand the lmwl and the blue sink δ18o δ2h regression line intersected at the point of 4 3 δ18o and 24 0 δ2h which were more enriched than the mean rainwater isotope values indicating another possible water source other than the local rains 3 3 sensitivity of using isotopes as tracers to quantify hydrology of the wetlands this study shows that the difference in isotopic signature between the rain and the surface water was significant and could be used to trace the contribution of a rain to the surface water of a wetland especially during tropical storms and hurricanes tables 1 and 5 for example the rain carried by the tropical storm colin had mean δ18o and δ2h of 12 5 and 92 9 respectively the surface water of pond 55 had mean δ18o and δ2h of 0 7 min 2 and max 3 9 and 2 3 min 24 3 and max 12 0 respectively during the study period the minimum and maximum combined δ18o and δ2h isotopic differences on a δ18o and δ2h plot between tropical storm colin and the pond 55 surface water were 69 4 and 106 2 respectively the combined error of the δ18o and δ2h plot was about 2 the uncertainty of using the isotopic signals to trace the contribution of the tropical storm colin rain to the surface water of pond 55 would be in a range between 1 9 and 2 9 of the total surface water volume in other words the contribution of the tropical storm colin to the surface water of pond 55 can be sensitively quantified using the isotopic signals with the resolution of 1 9 2 9 of the total surface water volume similar analysis for the blue sink indicated the resolution of rain water contribution from tropical storm colin to be in the range between 2 0 and 2 5 of the total surface water volume in case of the hurricane hermine event the resolution of rain water contribution to pond 55 would be in a range between 2 3 and 4 1 of the total surface water volume and that of the blue sink would be between 2 6 and 3 3 of the total surface water volume the surface water volumes of those wetlands are relatively small in which the increase of the surface water during a storm could easily exceed 10 of the total water volume the rainfall contribution to the pond 55 during the category 1 hurricane hermine was 38 3 according to the isotopic signals while tropical storms and hurricanes like colin and hermine provide us with most desirable opportunities to trace the hydrology of those wetlands other rains also may provide good opportunities as well we used the most and least depleted rains other than tropical storms and hurricanes to calculate the uncertainty resolution of rain water contribution to the surface water of those wetlands the results showed that in case of pond 55 the resolution ranged from 4 6 to 30 0 of the total surface water volume and in case of the blue sink it ranged from 5 7 to 11 3 of the total surface water volume in the case of tropical storm cindy the resolution of rain contribution to pond 55 and blue sink total surface water volumes ranged 5 2 65 2 and 6 6 15 5 respectively the much higher maximum uncertainty 65 2 could still occur especially when preceded by other tropical storms or hurricanes these results show that not all rain events were suitable for the tracer approach but many heavier rain events were the estimated contribution of the rain water to the surface water of the wetlands by the isotopic method are all in relative terms i e of the total water volume and applicable to only a specific rain event we can convert those increase in water volumes to the absolute water storage of the pond however by the following strategy first we need to construct the water depth vs surface area relationship by topographic contour plot and surface water area vs water depth to a reference point measurements then we can convert the surface water area vs water depth relationship to a delta water volume increase vs water depth to the reference level increase relationship with this delta water volume increase vs water depth to the reference level increase information we can identify the corresponding water volume increase by the isotopic method during a runoff event and calculate the absolute water volume of the pond at that water depth to the reference level we then have a very convenient means to know the absolute water storage of the pond at any given time by just knowing the water depth to the reference level of a pond at that time monitoring changes in surface water depth to the reference level then becomes a convenient way to quantify hydrologic parameters of the drainage area around the wetland such as runoff precipitation ratio charge discharge rates of the wetland evapotranspiration rate of the drainage area and evaporation rate of the surface water 3 4 evaporation extent of isolated forested wetlands isotopic enrichment of a water body relative to its potential sources is an indication of evaporation assuming isotopic equilibrium between the liquid and vapor phases the degree of primary evaporation of the water body at a given temperature and humidity can be calculated using the craig gordon c g

day temperature and humidity values taken from online meteorological data were used in the calculations benettin et al 2018 argued that not all δ18o δ2h regression lines from soil pore waters and xylem waters can be called lels due to possible multiple sources of waters for ponds 55 and 12 and other ponds that are derived from a single source of water we can use the above equations to calculate their possible evaporative losses isotope data along the pond 55 lel represented calculated evaporative losses that ranged from 20 to 48 with a mean of 35 3 7 3 n 72 fig 6 during the study period on the other hand mean evaporative loss at pond 12 was 46 9 7 3 n 34 fig 6 during the study period pond 12 has much shallower profile and larger surface depth ratio than pond 55 which explains the more significant evaporation observed in the surface water according to previous studies the evaporative enrichment is a dominant factor in the isotope balance of closed or lentic hydrological systems such as lakes and wetlands e g krabbenhoft et al 1990 meyers et al 1993 saxena 1996 gremillion and wanielista 2000 marimuthu et al 2005 with the isotope repeated measurement error of 0 3 and 2 for δ18o and δ2h respectively uncertainties in evaporative loss measurements can be calculated from isotope gradient evaporative loss and the repeated measurement error evaporative loss measurement uncertainty evaporation loss 0 3 for δ18o or 2 for δ2h isotope gradient low calculated evaporative loss measurement with uncertainties of 1 8 0 2 for δ18o based and 2 0 0 2 δ2h based gave good confidence to the estimated evaporative losses of the two ponds as long as the latter values are significantly above the measurement uncertainties for pond 55 the passage of hurricane hermine followed by a prolonged dry period 85 days gave us an opportunity to estimate the extent of evaporation during the dry period with the pond 55 lel being δ2h 5 2 δ18o 13 7 r2 0 98 n 8 the intersection of this lel with the lmwl is at 9 2 and 61 3 for δ18o and δ2h respectively we sampled the water between the 15th and 85th days after the hurricane evaporative loss during the 70 day dry period caused the δ18o and δ2h of pond 55 surface water to be enriched by 3 7 and 16 2 respectively fig 7 the evaporation loss was calculated to be 20 5 3 5 of the original surface water volume the isotope data for pond 12 on the other hand encompassed the 46 dry days between water samplings which showed δ18o and δ2h enrichments to be 1 5 and 10 8 respectively fig 7 the evaporation loss over the 46 day dry period was calculated to be 11 3 0 4 of the original surface water unlike the cases of the rainwater fed pond 55 and 12 blue sink had the mixed contribution of rain and groundwater whose isotopic signature was unknown the evaporation of the blue sink therefore cannot be deduced similarly from the lel however the blue sink lel during this extended dry period δ2h 5 9 δ18o 7 5 r2 0 93 n 8 intersected the lmwl at δ18o 9 3 and δ2h 62 2 very similar to that of the pond 55 δ18o 9 2 and δ2h 61 3 and close to the signals of the hurricane hermine rainfall δ18o 11 1 3 1 and δ2h 80 4 25 9 n 7 we therefore suspect that the rainwater of hurricane hermine probably contributed to the majority of the surface water both in pond 55 and blue sink right after the event with that assumption we estimated the evaporation loss of the blue sink during the 70 day dry period to be 13 1 0 2 blue sink 18o and 2h enrichments reached 1 9 and 12 0 respectively fig 7 in the laboratory the 14 day beaker evaporation experiment using pond 55 waters yielded a total accumulated evaporative loss of 57 5 1 3 with an accompanying 5 0 and 27 6 enrichment of the 18o and 2h isotopes respectively we observed a significant direct correlation between the measured laboratory beaker evaporation losses and those calculated using the c g model fig 8 p 0 05 other pan evaporation rate studies e g gibson et al 1999 van den akker et al 2011 have reported results with high direct regression coefficients r2 0 9 and with mostly 1 1 correlations between their measured and theoretical values this is in contrast to our study in which laboratory measured values were much higher than those that were calculated fig 8 as other studies had pointed out small drying pans 1 l are oversensitive to atmospheric conditions and provide information that is less hydrologically useful e g welhan and fritz 1977 gonfiantini 1986 gibson et al 1999 however even with the small drying pan size the 2 week laboratory experiment still demonstrated a pond 55 evaporation line of δ2h 5 3 δ18o 6 2 r2 0 99 n 5 that was similar to the measured lel δ2h 5 1 δ18o 5 7 r2 0 63 n 72 table 6 furthermore the closed bottom pvc set up installed upslope of pond 55 also showed a similar lel δ2h 5 5 δ18o 4 8 r2 0 80 n 57 gibson and reid 2014 also reported evaporation pan δ18o and δ2h values were similar to the lake isotope values pond 12 another isolated wetland in our study area also showed similar lels between its natural surface waters δ2h 5 6 δ18o 5 6 r2 0 77 n 34 table 6 and pvc counterpart δ2h 5 4 δ18o 4 3 r2 0 90 n 16 the lel comparison of waters from pond 55 and the pvc and beaker experiments suggest that in a hydrological system in which precipitation and evaporation serve as the dominant inflow and outflow conduits such as isolated wetlands the isotopic signature of water can serve as a powerful tracer for studying the water balance due to evaporation we believe that the results we had obtained from this study can be applied to the similar isolated wetlands in the apalachicola national forest and other humid subtropical regions while not a subject of this research the use of the water isotope tracer techniques could also be applied to study the hydrological processes of other isolated palustrine systems such as those dominated by and have more than 50 areal coverage of deciduous trees and shrubs national wetlands inventory accessed 27 oct 2019 this study confirms the sensitivity of the approach and gives us a valuable guidance to our subsequent study of the hydrology in those isolated wetlands in the region 4 conclusion this study has documented the stable isotope signals of the rain the soil pore water and the surface water of the study area the results show the sensitivity and resolution of using the stable isotopic signals to quantify the hydrology of those wetlands the measured local meteoric water line follows closely the global meteoric water line indicating minimal evaporation during rainfall we observed no significant correlations between isotopic signatures with either temperature or relative humidity there was lacking seasonality in the isotopic signatures except during the hurricane season when hurricanes and tropical storms contribute much depleted isotopic signals we did observe a significant inverse correlation between isotopes and rainfall amount we were able to show that the ephemeral ponds pond 55 and pond 12 were mainly derived from rain water and that the blue sink has water source other than rain water this study shows that the δ18o and δ2h of rains especially heavier rains were significantly depleted in comparison to those of the surface water of the wetlands those significant differences in stable isotopic signals can be used to trace the contribution of rain water to the surface water the sources of surface water and the extent of surface evaporation of those wetlands the stable isotope tracers can be a powerful and much simpler tool
