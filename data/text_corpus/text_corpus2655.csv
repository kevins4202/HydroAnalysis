13275,bioretention systems are frequently used practice in stormwater treatment to remove pollutants from runoff and reduce waterlogging the additive materials of filler soil in bioretention facilities play a key role in function realization while the traditional additives have some problems of unstable removal efficiency on nutrients and decreasing hydrologic performance polyurethane biochar crosslinked material pcb is a new polyurethane composite material having low nutrients leaching quantities and strong adsorption capacity to evaluate the feasibility of pcb as an additive material of filler soil physicochemical properties tests adsorption experiments column experiments and soil water characteristic curve tests were conducted with the addition of pcb the particle grading and physicochemical properties of filler soil were optimized increasing the specific surface area and cation exchange capacity through electrostatic attraction and chemisorption pcb improved the adsorption quantities and further prolonged the lifespan of the filler soil owing to high cation exchange capacity and hydrophilicity of the pcb due to its porosity the matric suction of the pcb modified filler soil increased significantly as well as the permeability coefficient and saturated water content the application of pcb expanded the contact area and time between stormwater and filler soil and increased the infiltration channels providing better conditions for adsorption reaction the results suggest the addition of pcb optimized adsorption and hydrologic performance of the filler soil in bioretention facilities showing promising potential for stormwater treatment graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords polyurethane composite material additive material bioretention facilities ammonium and phosphate adsorption hydrologic performance 1 introduction with the rapid urban growth impervious surfaces such as asphalt roads and concrete squares gradually replace original greenfields in cities 1 it leads to a decline in the natural water retention quantities of urban underground spaces further resulting in sewer overflows and urban waterlogging 2 meanwhile increasing anthropogenic activities along with the changes of land use accelerate the release of various pollutants from point and non point sources into aquatic ecosystem 3 specifically urban stormwater runoff transport and accumulate diverse contaminants including heavy metals pathogens nutrients oil organic substances and suspended solids into waterways lakes rivers and underground water 4 5 aimed at alleviating the degradation of water retention capacity and the runoff pollution in urban areas a wide range of stormwater treatment technologies has been developed by restoring more natural flow regimes and reducing the loads of pollutants 6 one of the most promising stormwater treatment technologies is bioretention systems 7 bioretention systems are often utilized in metropolitan areas to combat water quality and hydrologic impacts of stormwater 6 the two targets can be achieved by selecting an appropriate structure of the bioretention systems which consists of a vegetation layer at the top a filtration layer a transition layer and a drainage layer at the bottom 8 the medium of filler soil in the filtration layer constitutes the decisive factor for high efficiency of the bioretention systems and it plays a key role in pollutants control and hydrologic reduction in stormwater treatment 9 traditional filler soil in bioretention systems is a mixture of 60 90 sand 5 20 clay soil and 5 20 organic additive materials such as peat wood chips and compost by mass 10 sand forming a framework zone in the filler soil can improve the permeability of the system and clay soil has strong fertility retention capacity and high water content which will support the growth of the plants in the vegetation layer 11 the addition of organic matter in filler soil can adsorb diverse contaminants to achieve the goal of stormwater treatment as well as provide necessary nutrients for plants and microorganisms 12 previous researcher have proved that organic additives in filler soil have effective removal of heavy metals oil organic compounds and solids 9 13 however due to nitrogen and phosphorus leaching in stormwater treatment traditional filler soil has unstable efficiency on the removal of nutrients which has been found in laboratory prototypes and field condition 14 investigators have made efforts to optimize filler soil using different additive materials to achieve desired characteristics the range of additive materials studied in different studies can be divided into three types biological waste materials mineral materials and biochar biological waste materials e g coconut water treatment sludge tea leaves rice husk etc can remove heavy metals via ion exchange surface adsorption and complexation 15 16 yet they have similar defect with traditional additives which is high leaching potential of nutrients 17 mineral materials including volcanic rocks vermiculite and ceramicite etc have strong water permeability with less nutrients 18 19 but they have lower saturated water content and this is at variance with the original goal of bioretention facilities biochar is a proven sorbent for removal of heavy metals organic pollutants viruses and microorganisms 20 nonetheless the phosphorus leaching from biochar can not be neglected in bioretention facilities during laboratory and field stormwater treatment studies 21 22 faced with the challenges of the multiple stormwater treatment targets pollutants control and hydrologic reduction and the limitations of existing additive materials polyurethane biochar crosslinked material pcb has been exploited as a potential additive material in bioretention systems polyurethane composite materials have been gradually applied into agricultural fertilizers to preserve moisture and fertility for amelioration of desertification 23 pcb is a new kind of polyurethane composite material which was modified by hardwood biochar to improve adsorption capacity of the original polyurethane sponge some preliminary studies have been conducted to test the material characterizations of pcb and evaluate the potential impacts in environmental matrices after the application pcb has high water retention capacity and permeability which will help to reduce runoff peak and volume in stormwater treatment 24 as for nutrients leaching pcb releases negligible amounts of nitrogen and phosphorus in the successive leaching artificial stormwater solution 24 25 from the perspective of water quality enhancement the equilibrium adsorption quantities of pcb in the typical nutrients concentration of stormwater runoff are 93 206 mg kg 1 for phosphate and 44 97 mg kg 1 for ammonium which are much higher than some mineral materials and biochar 25 the decomposition temperature of polyurethane composite materials is higher than 245 c indicating they have the good durability of physicochemical properties under multi field coupling in the long term 26 several preliminary explorations have been carried out on the physicochemical and adsorption properties of pcb but there is still a lack of quantitative research and mechanism analysis on the removal of pollutants by using pcb as a filler soil additive in stormwater treatment and its influence on the hydrology of the bioretention systems needs to be further explored the objective of this study is to examine the nutrients removal potential and soil water characteristics of pcb modified filler soil and test the suitability of pcb as a filter media material for bioretention facilities the study compared nutrients adsorption capacities and hydrologic properties of the control filler soil and the pcb modified filler soil using isothermal adsorption experiments and laboratory columns 2 materials and methods 2 1 filler soil preparation and the physicochemical characterizations tests polyurethane biochar crosslinked material pcb was synthesized with a simple one pot method by jinlian landscape engineering services co ltd hangzhou china

facility standards 10 pcb modified filler soil is a mixture of river sand silty clay and pcb at a mass ratio of 88 8 4 for comparison with other additive materials volcanic stone vs hardwood biochar hb and compost co are also chosen as experimental groups which are added into the filler soil in the same proportion of pcb the additive materials are produced by jinlian landscape engineering

scanning electron microscope hitachi tokyo japan working at an accelerating voltage of 10 kv 2 2 ammonium and phosphate adsorption experiments in order to evaluate the effects of pcb on the nutrients adsorption capacity of filler soil in the application of bioretention facilities the isothermal adsorption experiments on ammonium nh4 n and phosphate po4 3 p were carried out on the control and the experimental filler soil the standard solutions of 100 mg l 1 nh4cl and na2hpo4 were diluted to 0 5 1 2 5 7 and 10 mg l 1 with deionized water respectively furthermore 10 g of the control and the experimental filler soil were put into a 50 ml conical flask and 20 ml of the above concentration solution was added into respective flasks the conical flasks were oscillated for 24 h at 150 rpm at 20 2 c the san continuous flow analyzer skalar dutch was used for the testing of nh4 n and po4 3 p in order to explore the nh4 n and po4 3 p adsorption properties and capacities of the control and the experimental filler soil langmuir and freundlich models were used to fit the adsorption equilibrium quantities q e mg kg 1 of nh4 n and po4 3 p after 24 h with the eqs 1 and 2 27 1 q e k f c e 1 n 2 q

column experiments were carried out in the laboratory to simulate the performance of the control and the experimental filler soil under an actual working situation fig 2 demonstrates the devices and process of the experiment there were 4 sets of columns with a height of 30 cm an inner diameter of 6 cm and 3 mm holes of sieve tray at the bottom filter papers were placed above the sieve tray and dried filler soil control filler soil and experimental filler soil were filled into the columns respectively for each 2 cm of mixed filling a wooden hammer was employed to drop 5 times from 5 cm above the filler soil until it was filled to 26 cm washed and dried gravels were placed on top of the mixture filler soil to prevent current scour after filling peristaltic pumps bt01 100 were used at the top of the columns to pump artificial stormwater at a speed of 15 ml min 1 artificial stormwater consisted of 120 mg l 1 cacl2 2 mg l 1 nh4 n and 2 mg l 1 po4 3 p according to the typical concentration of runoff 28 the inflow velocity was calculated according to the rainfall intensity formula eq 3 in nanjing china 3 i 64 3 53 81 g p t 32 9 1 011 where i is the rainfall intensity mm p is the rainfall probability which is set for once a year t is the lasting time which is set for 3 h the catchment ratio of bioretention facilities was set as 15 the calculated stormwater inflow volume for per column in 1 year was 2 7 l the artificial stormwater was continuously pumped into the columns and effluent was collected hourly by the effluent tubing at the bottom to detect the contents of nh4 n and po4 3 p the detection methods were the same as above the injection of artificial stormwater lasted until the concentration of nh4 n and po4 3 p were higher than 2 mg l 1 2 4 infiltration experiments the permeability of the filler soil will directly determine the stormwater treatment performance of the bioretention facilities it is an important criterion to evaluate the efficiency of filler soil whether it can keep the rapid infiltration of stormwater and the long term high permeability the infiltration experiments were conducted using the same soil column device to evaluate the infiltration capacity and permeability of the filler soils as shown in fig 3 the control and experimental filler soil were filled into the soil columns with the same above method only doubling the hammer times from 5 to 10 times to simulate the settlement of filler soil peristaltic pumps were used to supply water maintaining the hydraulic head of 3 cm at the top of each soil column observed and recorded the seepage track and height once started and monitored the water outflow volume of the soil column at the bottom 2 5 soil water characteristic curve tests this study tested the soil water characteristic curves of the control and pcb modified filler soil by using filter paper method to analyze the influence of pcb addition on the water retention capacity of the filler soil make 20 standard cutting ring samples 20 mm of height 61 8 mm of diameter for each filler soil keeping the same density of filler soil samples in each group these samples were vacuumed by a pump immersed in deionized water for 24 h for saturation and then weighed they were transferred into the climate box in 20 2 c for evaporation and monitored their weight when the saturation of filler soil reached the expected value two samples were taken out and clamped three pieces of filter paper one smaller filter paper between two large filter paper the samples were wrapped tightly with plastic film and put into a sealed tank for 1 week to balance the suction between the filler soil samples and the filter papers after that the smaller filter paper was taken out and weighed to calculate the filter paper

specific physicochemical properties to enhance contaminants removal and hydraulic performance in our former researches pcb is stable and porous which has high cec and many functional groups as well as multivalent metal cations on its surface 24 at the same time the content of nutrients of pcb is low avoiding the leaching of nutrients fig 4 demonstrates ftir eds and sem images of pcb according to the basic characteristics of pcb it can be illustrated that the pcb meets the basic requirements for application in the bioretention systems which can increase the pore ratio cec and porosity the basic physicochemical properties of the filler soil will change with the addition of modified materials which will further affect its adsorption performance and hydraulic efficiency table 1 summarizes the physicochemical properties parameters of the control and the experimental filler soil depending on these indicators the addition of pcb greatly changed the size distribution and chemical properties compared to other materials with the addition of 4 of pcb filler soil became lighter and looser and the average grain diameter increased as a light and porous polyurethane material pcb can loosen the soil structure of filler soil and increase the volume of internal pores the sand and clay particles which were originally closely arranged and fitted together were unevenly distributed around pcb particles which greatly increased the intergranular pores the ph of filler soil went from 4 65 to 6 12 through ion exchange and surface adsorption the filler soil in bioretention facilities can adsorb pollutants in stormwater whose adsorption capacity are related to its specific surface area and cation exchange capacity river sand which accounts for 88 of the control filler soil has smooth surface and dense solid structure the surface of pcb is undulating and convex and there are abundant pores inside hence the specific surface area of filler soil greatly increased from 1 97 m2 g 1 to 9 46 m2 g 1 with the modification of pcb the cation exchange capacity of pcb is 37 5 24 the addition of pcb increased the cec of filler soil from 2 8 cmol kg 1 to 9 3 cmol kg 1 which can help to improve the purification effect on cations such as ammonia 3 2 isothermal adsorption properties of filler soil the adsorption experiment results of nh4 n and po4 3 p by the control and the experimental filler soil are shown in fig 5 the compost modified filler soil had negative adsorption quantities so it is not discussed in the following in general the addition of pcb significantly improved the adsorption capacity of the filler soil on nh4 n and po4 3 p compared with hb and vs compared with the control filler soil the equilibrium adsorption capacity of the pcb modified filler soil on nh4 n is 0 934 13 998 mg kg 1 which is 2 28 5 10 times that of the control group 0 183 5 714 mg kg 1 and obviously higher than hb and vs in the bioretention facilities the removal of nh4 n from stormwater runoff is mainly through ion exchange or surface adsorption by filler soil 31 table 1 confirms that pcb has high amounts of cec and bet and the addition of pcb can improve the ion exchange capacity and internal pore volume of filler soil the ratio of mesopore micropore and macropores of filler soil will also influence the surface adsorption if the ratio is kept in a moderate range the adsorption capacity of cations will be improved 32 there are many pores of various sizes on the surface and inside of pcb the pore ratio of filler soil may be optimized with the addition of pcb in addition the adsorption of nh4 n by polyurethane materials also involves in chemisorption 33 oxygen containing functional groups on the surface of pcb could adsorb hydrogen atom in nh4 by its oxygen atom to form stable hydrogen bond through electrostatic attraction therefore pcb can greatly improve the adsorption capacity of the filler soil on nh4 n the pcb modified filler soil has the strongest equilibrium adsorption capacity in po4 3 p adsorption which was 2 21 2 69 times of that of the control filler soil the equilibrium adsorption quantities are 0 274 4 016 mg kg 1 for the pcb modified filler soil and 0 936 14 494 mg kg 1 for the control filler soil for the treatment of phosphate containing stormwater chemical sedimentation and adsorption are the most adopted techniques 34 35 divalent and trivalent metal ions including magnesium iron alum or calcium from adsorbents can combine with phosphate in stormwater to form magnesium phosphate crystal mg3 po4 2 hydroxyl apatite ca5 po4 3 oh and other stable compounds 36 37 in the control filler soil the main component of river sand is silica sio2 and there is few metal ions on its surface accounting for its low phosphate adsorption capacity the presence of metal ions in the additive materials enhances the adsorption of phosphate in the experimental filler soil the surface of pcb carries magnesium calcium aluminum and other metal ions in fig 3 and the cec of pcb is high providing a basis for ion exchange and chemical precipitation of phosphate removal overall the increase of the nutrients adsorption capacity of the filler soil with the addition of pcb was realized by optimizing the adsorption conditions and enhancing the adsorption capacity as for the adsorption condition pcb is porous and the its surface is uneven with many folds providing more adsorption space hence in the process of contacting with stormwater runoff pcb can improve the contact area between stormwater and filler soil increase the infiltration channel and contact time and provide better conditions for adsorption reaction the improvement on nutrients adsorption of the pcb modified filler soil is the comprehensive results of physical attraction and chemical adsorption the addition of pcb increased the cec of filler soil and pcb has many oxygen containing functional groups leading to more active ion exchange and the formation of more stable hydrogen bonds abundant divalent metal ions on the surface of pcb help to promote the complexation reaction between filler soil and phosphate the results of the isothermal adsorption of the control and the experimental filler soil were fitted to two adsorption models as shown in table 2 both the models can reproduce the isotherm data fairly well with correlation coefficients r 2 exceeding 0 95 from the perspective of nh4 n adsorption the langmuir model can be better used to fit the adsorption data of the pcb modified filler soil but the langmuir model fits sightly better for po4 3 p adsorption suggesting the adsorption of po4 3 p onto the pcb modified filler soil was controlled by heterogeneous processes according to the maximum adsorption capacity q max in the langmuir model the addition of pcb increased the adsorption limit of the control filler soil for nh4 n by 1 12 times and 1 85 times for po4 3 p in the freundlich model the reciprocal of the characteristic constants 1 n of the control and the experimental filler soil were less than 1 indicating that the adsorption of filler soil is nonlinear adsorption fig 6 shows the adsorption rate of nh4 n and po4 3 p by the control and the pcb modified fill soil at different concentrations of nutrients with the addition of pcb the adsorption rate of nh4 n increased from 18 3 39 0 to 70 0 93 4 and that of po4 3 p increased from 20 1 27 4 to 72 5 93 9 the adsorption rates of nutrients decreased with the increase of nutrients concentration the adsorption rates of the pcb modified filler soil in the same concentration of nh4 n and po4 3 p were similar the typical nh4 n and po4 3 p concentration of stormwater is around 2 5 mg l 1 at that range of concentrations the adsorption rates of the pcb modified filler soil were all above 80 which were all lower than 40 for the control filler soil it should be noted that the solid liquid mixing ratio the filler soil to the stormwater runoff in the isothermal adsorption experiments was 0 5 g ml 1 in the actual application of filler soil in bioretention facilities the amount of filler soil can be adjusted according to the runoff concentration and rainfall of the local stormwater to optimize the facility economy and adsorption effects 3 3 adsorption capacities and lifespans of filler soil the control pcb modified hb modified and vs modified filler soil were selected to build columns for continuous operation adsorption experiments the outflow concentrations for different columns were shown in fig 7 when outflow concentrations of the column were high than 1 9 mg l 1 for more than 3 h we defined the filler soil has reached saturation situation and stopped the injection of stormwater generally the addition of materials into filler soil reduced the effluent concentration of nh4 n and po4 3 p and improved the nutrients removal rates of the columns the column filled with pcb modified filler soil had the best removal performance the removal effect of po4 3 p by the soil columns was better than that of nh4 n the trend and order of the column test results were consistent with the isothermal adsorption test results to estimate the lifespan of each column second order polynomial was used to fit the outflow concentration trend line when outflow concentration of the column was higher than 1 8 mg l 1 the filler soil was defined to have outlived its usefulness the fitting results and estimated lifespans are listed in table 3 the smaller the trend line quadratic term ratios are the gentler the trend line will be the constant terms of the trend line predict the outflow concentrations in the first stage the r 2 of the trend lines indicates that the outflow concentrations can be fitted by parabola adsorption quantities were calculated based on the outflow concentration and inflow volume when take nh4 n as the target pollutant the column filled with the pcb modified filler soil had a service life of 10 4 years whose adsorption quantities was 35 957 mg kg 1 as for po4 3 p removal it got the saturation situation after 11 3 years of inflow volume and its adsorption quantities was 42 499 mg kg 1 the lifespans of other soil columns were all less than 10 years it should be noted that the column tests did not take the effects of vegetation into consideration hence in actual use the lifespan of bioretention facilities might actually be longer because of the positive effects in nutrients adsorption of the plants 9 the parameter q max from langmuir model is also used to estimated lifespans of each column to evaluate whether isothermal adsorption tests can be used to predict the lifespan of filler soils which is listed in table 3 although the ratio of the weight of filler soil to the runoff inflow volume in column experiments was much lower than the solid liquid mixing ratio 0 5 g ml 1 in isothermal adsorption tests the lifespans of filler soil in soil column experiments were much higher than those calculated by langmuir model the hydrophilicity of additive materials and the contact way between the filler soil and runoff are important factors affecting the nutrients removal performance of bioretention facilities in the stormwater treatment during runoff infiltration 38 as a polyurethane material pcb has strong hydrophilicity due to its concave and convex surface 39 and it could quickly capture stormwater to complete the adsorption process when contacting with runoff compared with isothermal adsorption experiments the contact time between filler soil and runoff in soil column experiments was shorter and the hydraulic action was reduced the nutrients adsorbed on the filler soil surface were difficult to be washed away in columns therefore even if there was heavier inflow volume in the column experiments the nutrient removal performance of filler soil was better in this study the artificial stormwater was continuously injected into soil columns however rainfall is intermittent in practice with the intervals of dry period pollutants take a series of physical chemical and biological changes in the media during the dry period especially for nitrogen 40 under an intermittently wetting regime the ammonium is removed via adsorption during the stormwater dosing and nitrification during subsequent dry days leading to the nitrite leaching in the next rainfall 41 in the drying stage the filler soil is unsaturated filled with water and air providing conditions for nitrification to improve the nitrate removal performance internal water storage layer or zero valent iron have been set for denitrification in some researches 42 when the pcb modified filler soil is applied to the bioretention facilities it is necessary to design the scale of the facilities and determine whether to take denitrification measures according to the local rainfall and common pollutants in runoff meanwhile the application of pcb into the field tests of bioretention facilities for the real stormwater is necessary to be carried out in the future 3 4 hydrologic properties of filler soil the filler soil in bioretention facilities is also responsible for reducing peak flow and providing moisture to the vegetation layer besides pollutants removal and bioretention facilities lifespan can be also limited by clogging therefore it is necessary to discuss the hydrologic properties water retention capacity and permeability of the modified filler soil the constant water head infiltration test was carried out on the control and the experimental filler soil to simulate the operation of bioretention facilities under heavy rainfall the infiltration characteristic curves in the process of runoff infiltrating into the dried filler soil are shown in fig 8 the infiltration characteristic curves of the vs and hb modified filler soil almost coincided with that of the control filler soil and the curve of the hb modified filler soil gradually lagged in the later infiltration period the infiltration speed of the pcb modified filler soil was obviously slower than those of the other groups in the initial stage and the gap gradually widened with the infiltration of runoff the reason for the lag of the pcb modified filler soil was that infiltration runoff saturates the upper filler soil layer first and then permeated downward the average densities of the control and pcb modified filler soil were 1 60 g cm 3 and 1 09 g cm 3 respectively the addition of pcb reduced the bulk density of the filler soil and increased the pore volume between the sand clay particles because of the hydrophilicity of pcb it is easy to catch runoff when contacting with it especially for dried filler soil the water holding capacity can be characterized by the water content of the filler soil after infiltration the water content of the pcb modified filler soil was 1 65 times that of the control filler soil this feature is beneficial for the bioretention systems to cope with short term storm events which can absorb a large amount of runoff quickly in a short time delay the occurrence time of peak flow and have a better stormwater retention performance in the long term operation of bioretention facilities the permeability of the filler soil will gradually decrease due to the weight of the filler soil and the deposition of solid pollutants to explore the permeability of the filler soil during the later period of operation the filler soils were double tamped to simulate settlement and silting the permeability characteristic curves of the control and experimental filler soil are shown in fig 9 the effluent speed of the pcb modified filler soil was faster than that of the control filler soil but slower than those of the vs and hb modified filler soil the main factors affecting the permeability of the filler soil were the particle grading and the hydrophilicity of the medium 43 the particle size of vs was much larger than sand and clay which adjusted the particle distribution of the filler soil and hydrophilicity of vs was poor so it had the strongest permeability rainwater gathered around pcb particles was not easy to penetrate downward because of its strong hydrophilicity hence the permeability of the pcb modified filler soil was not as good as the other two experimental filler soils however pcb has larger particle size and internal pores the addition of pcb optimized the particle grading of the filler soil and the internal pores provided more paths and channels for runoff infiltration therefore the permeability of the pcb modified filler soil was better than that of the control filler soil in europe and the united states the permeability coefficient of the filler soil in the biretention system is required to range from 3 47 10 6 to 5 5 10 5 m s 1 44 considering the rainfall characteristics and pollutant reduction requirements in china scholars suggest that the permeability coefficient of filler soil should be higher than 10 5 m s 1 45 the permeability coefficient of the control filler soil and the pcb modified filler soil were 9 68 10 6 m s 1 and 1 47 10 5 m s 1 respectively and the pcb modified filler soil meets the relevant recommended requirements of the permeability coefficient 3 5 soil water characteristics of filler soil soil water characteristic curve can reflect the characteristics of water holding and water releasing dynamics of soil which can further evaluate its pollution reducing capacity on flood and supporting effectiveness on vegetation the soil water characteristic curves of the control and pcb modified filler soil are shown in fig 10 the results and curves of the vs and hb modified filler soil were close to that of the control filler soil so they were not drawn in the figure in the saturated state the matric suction of the filler soil with the addition of pcb was increased from 2 694 kpa to 3 437 kpa and the volumetric water content was increased by 32 1 at the same saturation the matric suctions of the filler soil were increased by 17 4 452 6 the van genuchten model can well fit the soil water characteristic curves of the control and pcb modified filler soil and the fitting parameters are shown in table 4 according to the fitting curve the addition of pcb increased the volume water content at wilting point of the filler soil from 0 052 cm3 cm 3 to 0 076 cm3 cm 3 and the field capacity the volume water content when matric suction was 20 kpa was 55 8 higher than that of the control filler soil the lightweight loose and porous structure of pcb increased the pore volumes between the particles of the filler soil and helped to improve the water content of the filler soil at low matric suction the enhancement to water holding capacity of filler soil by pcb was helpful to increase the retention of stormwater runoff in bioretention systems delay the flood peak and reduce the discharge the increase will improve the hydraulic retention time of the bioretention facilities prolong the purification reaction time of pollutants in the systems and promote the adsorption effect of stormwater runoff 4 conclusion polyurethane biochar crosslinked material pcb is a new kind of polyurethane composite material pcb has low density low nutrient leaching quantities high ion exchange capacity strong hydrophilicity large specific surface area abundant internal pores and oxygen containing functional groups which are suitable for the addition into filler soil in stormwater treatment with the addition of pcb the density of the filler soil decreased the pore ratio increased by 38 the ph increased from 4 65 to 6 12 the specific surface area increased by 380 and the cation exchange capacity increased by 229 the adsorption capacity of the pcb modified filler soil on nutrients was significantly improved in isothermal adsorption experiments the maximum adsorption quantities of nh4 n and po4 3 p increased by 1 12 times and 1 85 times respectively at the typical nutrients concentrations of stormwater runoff the adsorption rates of the pcb modified filler soil were all above 80 which were all lower than 40 for the control filler soil in the soil column experiments the pcb extended the lifespan of the filler soil by 1 50 1 59 times these improvements were credit to high cation exchange capacity and hydrophilicity of the pcb with the addition of pcb the saturated water content of the modified filler soil increased by 1 65 times and the permeability coefficient increased by 1 52 times pcb brought down the density of the filler soil and increased the pore volume between soil particles providing the attachment and seepage channels for runoff the volume water content of the pcb modified filler soil at wilting point was 0 076 cm3 cm 3 1 65 times of the control filler soil and the field capacity was 55 8 higher than that of the control filler soil the porous structure of pcb can increase the water retention capacity of the filler soil and prolong the hydraulic retention time of bioretention facilities in conclusion the application of pcb has significantly improved the physicochemical properties nutrients adsorption and water retention capacity of the filler soil the pcb modified filler soil used in bioretention facilities can help to achieve the goals of pollutants removal and hydrological reduction in stormwater treatment

alleviating the degradation of water retention capacity and the runoff pollution in urban areas a wide range of stormwater treatment technologies has been developed by restoring more natural flow regimes and reducing the loads of pollutants 6 one of the most promising stormwater treatment technologies is bioretention systems 7 bioretention systems are often utilized in metropolitan areas to combat water quality and hydrologic impacts of stormwater 6 the two targets can be achieved by selecting an appropriate structure of the bioretention systems which consists of a vegetation layer at the top a filtration layer a transition layer and a drainage layer at the bottom 8 the medium of filler soil in the filtration layer constitutes the decisive factor for high efficiency of the bioretention systems and it plays a key role in pollutants control and hydrologic reduction in stormwater treatment 9 traditional filler soil in bioretention systems is a mixture of 60 90 sand 5 20 clay soil and 5 20 organic additive materials such as peat wood chips and compost by mass 10 sand forming a framework zone in the filler soil can improve the permeability of the system and clay soil has strong fertility retention capacity and high water content which will support the growth of the plants in the vegetation layer 11 the addition of organic matter in filler soil can adsorb diverse contaminants to achieve the goal of stormwater treatment as well as provide necessary nutrients for plants and microorganisms 12 previous researcher have proved that organic additives in filler soil have effective removal of heavy metals oil organic compounds and solids 9 13 however due to nitrogen and phosphorus leaching in stormwater treatment traditional filler soil has unstable efficiency on the removal of nutrients which has been found in laboratory prototypes and field condition 14 investigators have made efforts to optimize filler soil using different additive materials to achieve desired characteristics the range of additive materials studied in different studies can be divided into three types biological waste materials mineral materials and biochar biological waste materials e g coconut water treatment sludge tea leaves rice husk etc can remove heavy metals via ion exchange surface adsorption and complexation 15 16 yet they have similar defect with traditional additives which is high leaching potential of nutrients 17 mineral materials including volcanic rocks vermiculite and ceramicite etc have strong water permeability with less nutrients 18 19 but they have lower saturated water content and this is at variance with the original goal of bioretention facilities biochar is a proven sorbent for removal of heavy metals organic pollutants viruses and microorganisms 20 nonetheless the phosphorus leaching from biochar can not be neglected in bioretention facilities during laboratory and field stormwater treatment studies 21 22 faced with the challenges of the multiple stormwater treatment targets pollutants control and hydrologic reduction and the limitations of existing additive materials polyurethane biochar crosslinked material pcb has been exploited as a potential additive material in bioretention systems polyurethane composite materials have been gradually applied into agricultural fertilizers to preserve moisture and fertility for amelioration of desertification 23 pcb is a new kind of polyurethane composite material which was modified by hardwood biochar to improve adsorption capacity of the original polyurethane sponge some preliminary studies have been conducted to test the material characterizations of pcb and evaluate the potential impacts in environmental matrices after the application pcb has high water retention capacity and permeability which will help to reduce runoff peak and volume in stormwater treatment 24 as for nutrients leaching pcb releases negligible amounts of nitrogen and phosphorus in the successive leaching artificial stormwater solution 24 25 from the perspective of water quality enhancement the equilibrium adsorption quantities of pcb in the typical nutrients concentration of stormwater runoff are 93 206 mg kg 1 for phosphate and 44 97 mg kg 1 for ammonium which are much higher than some mineral materials and biochar 25 the decomposition temperature of polyurethane composite materials is higher than 245 c indicating they have the good durability of physicochemical properties under multi field coupling in the long term 26 several preliminary explorations have been carried out on the physicochemical and adsorption properties of pcb but there is still a lack of quantitative research and mechanism analysis on the removal of pollutants by using pcb as a filler soil additive in stormwater treatment and its influence on the hydrology of the bioretention systems needs to be further explored the objective of this study is to examine the nutrients removal potential and soil water characteristics of pcb modified filler soil and test the suitability of pcb as a filter media material for bioretention facilities the study compared nutrients adsorption capacities and hydrologic properties of the control filler soil and the pcb modified filler soil using isothermal adsorption experiments and laboratory columns 2 materials and methods 2 1 filler soil preparation and the physicochemical characterizations tests polyurethane biochar crosslinked material pcb was synthesized with a simple one pot method by jinlian landscape engineering services co ltd hangzhou china

facility standards 10 pcb modified filler soil is a mixture of river sand silty clay and pcb at a mass ratio of 88 8 4 for comparison with other additive materials volcanic stone vs hardwood biochar hb and compost co are also chosen as experimental groups which are added into the filler soil in the same proportion of pcb the additive materials are produced by jinlian landscape engineering

scanning electron microscope hitachi tokyo japan working at an accelerating voltage of 10 kv 2 2 ammonium and phosphate adsorption experiments in order to evaluate the effects of pcb on the nutrients adsorption capacity of filler soil in the application of bioretention facilities the isothermal adsorption experiments on ammonium nh4 n and phosphate po4 3 p were carried out on the control and the experimental filler soil the standard solutions of 100 mg l 1 nh4cl and na2hpo4 were diluted to 0 5 1 2 5 7 and 10 mg l 1 with deionized water respectively furthermore 10 g of the control and the experimental filler soil were put into a 50 ml conical flask and 20 ml of the above concentration solution was added into respective flasks the conical flasks were oscillated for 24 h at 150 rpm at 20 2 c the san continuous flow analyzer skalar dutch was used for the testing of nh4 n and po4 3 p in order to explore the nh4 n and po4 3 p adsorption properties and capacities of the control and the experimental filler soil langmuir and freundlich models were used to fit the adsorption equilibrium quantities q e mg kg 1 of nh4 n and po4 3 p after 24 h with the eqs 1 and 2 27 1 q e k f c e 1 n 2 q

column experiments were carried out in the laboratory to simulate the performance of the control and the experimental filler soil under an actual working situation fig 2 demonstrates the devices and process of the experiment there were 4 sets of columns with a height of 30 cm an inner diameter of 6 cm and 3 mm holes of sieve tray at the bottom filter papers were placed above the sieve tray and dried filler soil control filler soil and experimental filler soil were filled into the columns respectively for each 2 cm of mixed filling a wooden hammer was employed to drop 5 times from 5 cm above the filler soil until it was filled to 26 cm washed and dried gravels were placed on top of the mixture filler soil to prevent current scour after filling peristaltic pumps bt01 100 were used at the top of the columns to pump artificial stormwater at a speed of 15 ml min 1 artificial stormwater consisted of 120 mg l 1 cacl2 2 mg l 1 nh4 n and 2 mg l 1 po4 3 p according to the typical concentration of runoff 28 the inflow velocity was calculated according to the rainfall intensity formula eq 3 in nanjing china 3 i 64 3 53 81 g p t 32 9 1 011 where i is the rainfall intensity mm p is the rainfall probability which is set for once a year t is the lasting time which is set for 3 h the catchment ratio of bioretention facilities was set as 15 the calculated stormwater inflow volume for per column in 1 year was 2 7 l the artificial stormwater was continuously pumped into the columns and effluent was collected hourly by the effluent tubing at the bottom to detect the contents of nh4 n and po4 3 p the detection methods were the same as above the injection of artificial stormwater lasted until the concentration of nh4 n and po4 3 p were higher than 2 mg l 1 2 4 infiltration experiments the permeability of the filler soil will directly determine the stormwater treatment performance of the bioretention facilities it is an important criterion to evaluate the efficiency of filler soil whether it can keep the rapid infiltration of stormwater and the long term high permeability the infiltration experiments were conducted using the same soil column device to evaluate the infiltration capacity and permeability of the filler soils as shown in fig 3 the control and experimental filler soil were filled into the soil columns with the same above method only doubling the hammer times from 5 to 10 times to simulate the settlement of filler soil peristaltic pumps were used to supply water maintaining the hydraulic head of 3 cm at the top of each soil column observed and recorded the seepage track and height once started and monitored the water outflow volume of the soil column at the bottom 2 5 soil water characteristic curve tests this study tested the soil water characteristic curves of the control and pcb modified filler soil by using filter paper method to analyze the influence of pcb addition on the water retention capacity of the filler soil make 20 standard cutting ring samples 20 mm of height 61 8 mm of diameter for each filler soil keeping the same density of filler soil samples in each group these samples were vacuumed by a pump immersed in deionized water for 24 h for saturation and then weighed they were transferred into the climate box in 20 2 c for evaporation and monitored their weight when the saturation of filler soil reached the expected value two samples were taken out and clamped three pieces of filter paper one smaller filter paper between two large filter paper the samples were wrapped tightly with plastic film and put into a sealed tank for 1 week to balance the suction between the filler soil samples and the filter papers after that the smaller filter paper was taken out and weighed to calculate the filter paper

specific physicochemical properties to enhance contaminants removal and hydraulic performance in our former researches pcb is stable and porous which has high cec and many functional groups as well as multivalent metal cations on its surface 24 at the same time the content of nutrients of pcb is low avoiding the leaching of nutrients fig 4 demonstrates ftir eds and sem images of pcb according to the basic characteristics of pcb it can be illustrated that the pcb meets the basic requirements for application in the bioretention systems which can increase the pore ratio cec and porosity the basic physicochemical properties of the filler soil will change with the addition of modified materials which will further affect its adsorption performance and hydraulic efficiency table 1 summarizes the physicochemical properties parameters of the control and the experimental filler soil depending on these indicators the addition of pcb greatly changed the size distribution and chemical properties compared to other materials with the addition of 4 of pcb filler soil became lighter and looser and the average grain diameter increased as a light and porous polyurethane material pcb can loosen the soil structure of filler soil and increase the volume of internal pores the sand and clay particles which were originally closely arranged and fitted together were unevenly distributed around pcb particles which greatly increased the intergranular pores the ph of filler soil went from 4 65 to 6 12 through ion exchange and surface adsorption the filler soil in bioretention facilities can adsorb pollutants in stormwater whose adsorption capacity are related to its specific surface area and cation exchange capacity river sand which accounts for 88 of the control filler soil has smooth surface and dense solid structure the surface of pcb is undulating and convex and there are abundant pores inside hence the specific surface area of filler soil greatly increased from 1 97 m2 g 1 to 9 46 m2 g 1 with the modification of pcb the cation exchange capacity of pcb is 37 5 24 the addition of pcb increased the cec of filler soil from 2 8 cmol kg 1 to 9 3 cmol kg 1 which can help to improve the purification effect on cations such as ammonia 3 2 isothermal adsorption properties of filler soil the adsorption experiment results of nh4 n and po4 3 p by the control and the experimental filler soil are shown in fig 5 the compost modified filler soil had negative adsorption quantities so it is not discussed in the following in general the addition of pcb significantly improved the adsorption capacity of the filler soil on nh4 n and po4 3 p compared with hb and vs compared with the control filler soil the equilibrium adsorption capacity of the pcb modified filler soil on nh4 n is 0 934 13 998 mg kg 1 which is 2 28 5 10 times that of the control group 0 183 5 714 mg kg 1 and obviously higher than hb and vs in the bioretention facilities the removal of nh4 n from stormwater runoff is mainly through ion exchange or surface adsorption by filler soil 31 table 1 confirms that pcb has high amounts of cec and bet and the addition of pcb can improve the ion exchange capacity and internal pore volume of filler soil the ratio of mesopore micropore and macropores of filler soil will also influence the surface adsorption if the ratio is kept in a moderate range the adsorption capacity of cations will be improved 32 there are many pores of various sizes on the surface and inside of pcb the pore ratio of filler soil may be optimized with the addition of pcb in addition the adsorption of nh4 n by polyurethane materials also involves in chemisorption 33 oxygen containing functional groups on the surface of pcb could adsorb hydrogen atom in nh4 by its oxygen atom to form stable hydrogen bond through electrostatic attraction therefore pcb can greatly improve the adsorption capacity of the filler soil on nh4 n the pcb modified filler soil has the strongest equilibrium adsorption capacity in po4 3 p adsorption which was 2 21 2 69 times of that of the control filler soil the equilibrium adsorption quantities are 0 274 4 016 mg kg 1 for the pcb modified filler soil and 0 936 14 494 mg kg 1 for the control filler soil for the treatment of phosphate containing stormwater chemical sedimentation and adsorption are the most adopted techniques 34 35 divalent and trivalent metal ions including magnesium iron alum or calcium from adsorbents can combine with phosphate in stormwater to form magnesium phosphate crystal mg3 po4 2 hydroxyl apatite ca5 po4 3 oh and other stable compounds 36 37 in the control filler soil the main component of river sand is silica sio2 and there is few metal ions on its surface accounting for its low phosphate adsorption capacity the presence of metal ions in the additive materials enhances the adsorption of phosphate in the experimental filler soil the surface of pcb carries magnesium calcium aluminum and other metal ions in fig 3 and the cec of pcb is high providing a basis for ion exchange and chemical precipitation of phosphate removal overall the increase of the nutrients adsorption capacity of the filler soil with the addition of pcb was realized by optimizing the adsorption conditions and enhancing the adsorption capacity as for the adsorption condition pcb is porous and the its surface is uneven with many folds providing more adsorption space hence in the process of contacting with stormwater runoff pcb can improve the contact area between stormwater and filler soil increase the infiltration channel and contact time and provide better conditions for adsorption reaction the improvement on nutrients adsorption of the pcb modified filler soil is the comprehensive results of physical attraction and chemical adsorption the addition of pcb increased the cec of filler soil and pcb has many oxygen containing functional groups leading to more active ion exchange and the formation of more stable hydrogen bonds abundant divalent metal ions on the surface of pcb help to promote the complexation reaction between filler soil and phosphate the results of the isothermal adsorption of the control and the experimental filler soil were fitted to two adsorption models as shown in table 2 both the models can reproduce the isotherm data fairly well with correlation coefficients r 2 exceeding 0 95 from the perspective of nh4 n adsorption the langmuir model can be better used to fit the adsorption data of the pcb modified filler soil but the langmuir model fits sightly better for po4 3 p adsorption suggesting the adsorption of po4 3 p onto the pcb modified filler soil was controlled by heterogeneous processes according to the maximum adsorption capacity q max in the langmuir model the addition of pcb increased the adsorption limit of the control filler soil for nh4 n by 1 12 times and 1 85 times for po4 3 p in the freundlich model the reciprocal of the characteristic constants 1 n of the control and the experimental filler soil were less than 1 indicating that the adsorption of filler soil is nonlinear adsorption fig 6 shows the adsorption rate of nh4 n and po4 3 p by the control and the pcb modified fill soil at different concentrations of nutrients with the addition of pcb the adsorption rate of nh4 n increased from 18 3 39 0 to 70 0 93 4 and that of po4 3 p increased from 20 1 27 4 to 72 5 93 9 the adsorption rates of nutrients decreased with the increase of nutrients concentration the adsorption rates of the pcb modified filler soil in the same concentration of nh4 n and po4 3 p were similar the typical nh4 n and po4 3 p concentration of stormwater is around 2 5 mg l 1 at that range of concentrations the adsorption rates of the pcb modified filler soil were all above 80 which were all lower than 40 for the control filler soil it should be noted that the solid liquid mixing ratio the filler soil to the stormwater runoff in the isothermal adsorption experiments was 0 5 g ml 1 in the actual application of filler soil in bioretention facilities the amount of filler soil can be adjusted according to the runoff concentration and rainfall of the local stormwater to optimize the facility economy and adsorption effects 3 3 adsorption capacities and lifespans of filler soil the control pcb modified hb modified and vs modified filler soil were selected to build columns for continuous operation adsorption experiments the outflow concentrations for different columns were shown in fig 7 when outflow concentrations of the column were high than 1 9 mg l 1 for more than 3 h we defined the filler soil has reached saturation situation and stopped the injection of stormwater generally the addition of materials into filler soil reduced the effluent concentration of nh4 n and po4 3 p and improved the nutrients removal rates of the columns the column filled with pcb modified filler soil had the best removal performance the removal effect of po4 3 p by the soil columns was better than that of nh4 n the trend and order of the column test results were consistent with the isothermal adsorption test results to estimate the lifespan of each column second order polynomial was used to fit the outflow concentration trend line when outflow concentration of the column was higher than 1 8 mg l 1 the filler soil was defined to have outlived its usefulness the fitting results and estimated lifespans are listed in table 3 the smaller the trend line quadratic term ratios are the gentler the trend line will be the constant terms of the trend line predict the outflow concentrations in the first stage the r 2 of the trend lines indicates that the outflow concentrations can be fitted by parabola adsorption quantities were calculated based on the outflow concentration and inflow volume when take nh4 n as the target pollutant the column filled with the pcb modified filler soil had a service life of 10 4 years whose adsorption quantities was 35 957 mg kg 1 as for po4 3 p removal it got the saturation situation after 11 3 years of inflow volume and its adsorption quantities was 42 499 mg kg 1 the lifespans of other soil columns were all less than 10 years it should be noted that the column tests did not take the effects of vegetation into consideration hence in actual use the lifespan of bioretention facilities might actually be longer because of the positive effects in nutrients adsorption of the plants 9 the parameter q max from langmuir model is also used to estimated lifespans of each column to evaluate whether isothermal adsorption tests can be used to predict the lifespan of filler soils which is listed in table 3 although the ratio of the weight of filler soil to the runoff inflow volume in column experiments was much lower than the solid liquid mixing ratio 0 5 g ml 1 in isothermal adsorption tests the lifespans of filler soil in soil column experiments were much higher than those calculated by langmuir model the hydrophilicity of additive materials and the contact way between the filler soil and runoff are important factors affecting the nutrients removal performance of bioretention facilities in the stormwater treatment during runoff infiltration 38 as a polyurethane material pcb has strong hydrophilicity due to its concave and convex surface 39 and it could quickly capture stormwater to complete the adsorption process when contacting with runoff compared with isothermal adsorption experiments the contact time between filler soil and runoff in soil column experiments was shorter and the hydraulic action was reduced the nutrients adsorbed on the filler soil surface were difficult to be washed away in columns therefore even if there was heavier inflow volume in the column experiments the nutrient removal performance of filler soil was better in this study the artificial stormwater was continuously injected into soil columns however rainfall is intermittent in practice with the intervals of dry period pollutants take a series of physical chemical and biological changes in the media during the dry period especially for nitrogen 40 under an intermittently wetting regime the ammonium is removed via adsorption during the stormwater dosing and nitrification during subsequent dry days leading to the nitrite leaching in the next rainfall 41 in the drying stage the filler soil is unsaturated filled with water and air providing conditions for nitrification to improve the nitrate removal performance internal water storage layer or zero valent iron have been set for denitrification in some researches 42 when the pcb modified filler soil is applied to the bioretention facilities it is necessary to design the scale of the facilities and determine whether to take denitrification measures according to the local rainfall and common pollutants in runoff meanwhile the application of pcb into the field tests of bioretention facilities for the real stormwater is necessary to be carried out in the future 3 4 hydrologic properties of filler soil the filler soil in bioretention facilities is also responsible for reducing peak flow and providing moisture to the vegetation layer besides pollutants removal and bioretention facilities lifespan can be also limited by clogging therefore it is necessary to discuss the hydrologic properties water retention capacity and permeability of the modified filler soil the constant water head infiltration test was carried out on the control and the experimental filler soil to simulate the operation of bioretention facilities under heavy rainfall the infiltration characteristic curves in the process of runoff infiltrating into the dried filler soil are shown in fig 8 the infiltration characteristic curves of the vs and hb modified filler soil almost coincided with that of the control filler soil and the curve of the hb modified filler soil gradually lagged in the later infiltration period the infiltration speed of the pcb modified filler soil was obviously slower than those of the other groups in the initial stage and the gap gradually widened with the infiltration of runoff the reason for the lag of the pcb modified filler soil was that infiltration runoff saturates the upper filler soil layer first and then permeated downward the average densities of the control and pcb modified filler soil were 1 60 g cm 3 and 1 09 g cm 3 respectively the addition of pcb reduced the bulk density of the filler soil and increased the pore volume between the sand clay particles because of the hydrophilicity of pcb it is easy to catch runoff when contacting with it especially for dried filler soil the water holding capacity can be characterized by the water content of the filler soil after infiltration the water content of the pcb modified filler soil was 1 65 times that of the control filler soil this feature is beneficial for the bioretention systems to cope with short term storm events which can absorb a large amount of runoff quickly in a short time delay the occurrence time of peak flow and have a better stormwater retention performance in the long term operation of bioretention facilities the permeability of the filler soil will gradually decrease due to the weight of the filler soil and the deposition of solid pollutants to explore the permeability of the filler soil during the later period of operation the filler soils were double tamped to simulate settlement and silting the permeability characteristic curves of the control and experimental filler soil are shown in fig 9 the effluent speed of the pcb modified filler soil was faster than that of the control filler soil but slower than those of the vs and hb modified filler soil the main factors affecting the permeability of the filler soil were the particle grading and the hydrophilicity of the medium 43 the particle size of vs was much larger than sand and clay which adjusted the particle distribution of the filler soil and hydrophilicity of vs was poor so it had the strongest permeability rainwater gathered around pcb particles was not easy to penetrate downward because of its strong hydrophilicity hence the permeability of the pcb modified filler soil was not as good as the other two experimental filler soils however pcb has larger particle size and internal pores the addition of pcb optimized the particle grading of the filler soil and the internal pores provided more paths and channels for runoff infiltration therefore the permeability of the pcb modified filler soil was better than that of the control filler soil in europe and the united states the permeability coefficient of the filler soil in the biretention system is required to range from 3 47 10 6 to 5 5 10 5 m s 1 44 considering the rainfall characteristics and pollutant reduction requirements in china scholars suggest that the permeability coefficient of filler soil should be higher than 10 5 m s 1 45 the permeability coefficient of the control filler soil and the pcb modified filler soil were 9 68 10 6 m s 1 and 1 47 10 5 m s 1 respectively and the pcb modified filler soil meets the relevant recommended requirements of the permeability coefficient 3 5 soil water characteristics of filler soil soil water characteristic curve can reflect the characteristics of water holding and water releasing dynamics of soil which can further evaluate its pollution reducing capacity on flood and supporting effectiveness on vegetation the soil water characteristic curves of the control and pcb modified filler soil are shown in fig 10 the results and curves of the vs and hb modified filler soil were close to that of the control filler soil so they were not drawn in the figure in the saturated state the matric suction of the filler soil with the addition of pcb was increased from 2 694 kpa to 3 437 kpa and the volumetric water content was increased by 32 1 at the same saturation the matric suctions of the filler soil were increased by 17 4 452 6 the van genuchten model can well fit the soil water characteristic curves of the control and pcb modified filler soil and the fitting parameters are shown in table 4 according to the fitting curve the addition of pcb increased the volume water content at wilting point of the filler soil from 0 052 cm3 cm 3 to 0 076 cm3 cm 3 and the field capacity the volume water content when matric suction was 20 kpa was 55 8 higher than that of the control filler soil the lightweight loose and porous structure of pcb increased the pore volumes between the particles of the filler soil and helped to improve the water content of the filler soil at low matric suction the enhancement to water holding capacity of filler soil by pcb was helpful to increase the retention of stormwater runoff in bioretention systems delay the flood peak and reduce the discharge the increase will improve the hydraulic retention time of the bioretention facilities prolong the purification reaction time of pollutants in the systems and promote the adsorption effect of stormwater runoff 4 conclusion polyurethane biochar crosslinked material pcb is a new kind of polyurethane composite material pcb has low density low nutrient leaching quantities high ion exchange capacity strong hydrophilicity large specific surface area abundant internal pores and oxygen containing functional groups which are suitable for the addition into filler soil in stormwater treatment with the addition of pcb the density of the filler soil decreased the pore ratio increased by 38 the ph increased from 4 65 to 6 12 the specific surface area increased by 380 and the cation exchange capacity increased by 229 the adsorption capacity of the pcb modified filler soil on nutrients was significantly improved in isothermal adsorption experiments the maximum adsorption quantities of nh4 n and po4 3 p increased by 1 12 times and 1 85 times respectively at the typical nutrients concentrations of stormwater runoff the adsorption rates of the pcb modified filler soil were all above 80 which were all lower than 40 for the control filler soil in the soil column experiments the pcb extended the lifespan of the filler soil by 1 50 1 59 times these improvements were credit to high cation exchange capacity and hydrophilicity of the pcb with the addition of pcb the saturated water content of the modified filler soil increased by 1 65 times and the permeability coefficient increased by 1 52 times pcb brought down the density of the filler soil and increased the pore volume between soil particles providing the attachment and seepage channels for runoff the volume water content of the pcb modified filler soil at wilting point was 0 076 cm3 cm 3 1 65 times of the control filler soil and the field capacity was 55 8 higher than that of the control filler soil the porous structure of pcb can increase the water retention capacity of the filler soil and prolong the hydraulic retention time of bioretention facilities in conclusion the application of pcb has significantly improved the physicochemical properties nutrients adsorption and water retention capacity of the filler soil the pcb modified filler soil used in bioretention facilities can help to achieve the goals of pollutants removal and hydrological reduction in stormwater treatment

their presence has caused environmental hazards 7 most heavy metals are toxic metals that harm on the internal organs of the body 8 the passage of heavy metals into the natural cycle of the climate makes them enter the human body and cause different infections 9 different physical chemical and biological mechanisms for removing heavy metals from aqueous solutions are known filtration 10 and membrane processes 11 ion exchange 12 chemical precipitation 13 coagulation 14 and flocculation 15 floating 16 electrochemical treatment 17 photocatalyst 18 and adsorption 19 chemical precipitation is the normally utilized cycle for the removal of heavy metals from inorganic effluents relying upon the ph change in a basic solution the chemical precipitation inconveniences are complex the release of an excessive amount of too much sludge produced needs additional treatments coagulation flocculation is additionally utilized to handle wastewaters by adding a coagulant in the coagulation interaction nonetheless this treatment has the chance of weakening colloidal particles and in this manner bringing about sedimentation 20 21 different effluent treatment processes for heavy metal ions are associated with advantages and disadvantages a comparison of which is given in table 1 among the mentioned methods for removing heavy metals from effluent solutions one of the suitable methods with high efficiency and environmentally friendly is the adsorption method 22 among the two adsorption mechanisms the advantages of physical adsorption over chemical adsorption are high selectivity of adsorbents less environmental pollution and adsorption of particles by a particular surface in a substrate however in the process of chemical adsorption the adsorbent is not selectable as a result all the volume of used solvents in the unit is involved in the adsorption process the desorption process is also more straightforward in physical adsorption systems today many adsorbents have been developed that can adsorb heavy metal ions still the development of high adsorption levels and high adsorption speed such as nano porous material or polymeric adsorbents is becoming more and more critical 23 27 the different types of adsorbents in a category are shown in fig 1 at present various polymers natural and synthetic induced by radiation 28 31 in multiple forms of membranes 32 33 resins 34 hydrogels 35 fibers 36 and fibrous fabrics 37 39 have been developed with specific functional groups radiation techniques for adsorbent preparation have two primary systems a adjustment of polymeric or mineral materials by radiation induced graft copolymerization b synthesis of polymer gel hydrogel by crosslinking of radiation that crosslinking alludes to the binding of polymer chains by gamma radiation or electron beam 40 organic hydrogels or gels can be synthesized by radiation crosslinking 41 42 the notable provisions of radiation induced crosslinking are process control no compelling reason to add initiators hydrogel formation and sanitization in one step capacity to deliver gel particles with various measurements and designs by changing radiation boundaries 43 useful copolymers with modification of existing polymers due to high adsorption capacity and high selectivity of accepting functional groups as ligands to form bonds with metal ions in solutions have received much attention 44 46 crosslinked and modified polymer adsorbents are most interested in removing heavy metals from effluent solutions for the following reasons 1 polymeric adsorbents have a high adsorption capacity and their selectivity to remove the target material increases with special ligands 2 functional groups can easily be added to polymer chains to increase adsorption capacity 3 durability and flexibility of the polymer 4 different forms of polymer adsorbents can be prepared in large quantities 47 49 meanwhile the radiation induced graft method has been prevalent for combining different types of polymers with various functional groups such as amin nh2 nhr nhr2 nr3 quaternary phosphonium pr3 hydroxyl oh carboxylic coo sulfunate so3 phophate po oh 2 thiol sh nitrile cn schiff base rc n amide conh2 amidoxime nh2 noh etc 50 56 the specific review on the adsorption of heavy metals with polymeric adsorbents is not illustrated in the literature it would give essential experiences into the plan of new specific adsorbents towards heavy metal ions and comprehend their adsorption mechanisms the purpose of this paper is to consider the advantages of polymeric adsorbents prepared by radiation induced grafting polymerization it explains in detail the methods of radiation induced grafting polymerization in two ways of direct and indirect irradiation using different irradiations under different operating conditions this method facilitates and improves the grafting of monomers to polymer substrates in this study different types of polymer adsorbents are investigated the studies of polymer adsorbents due to radiation bonding for adsorption of heavy metals under adsorbent synthesis conditions such as irradiation method dose amount monomer type and functional groups and adsorption process operating conditions are reviewed the literature survey from the last 20 years is the basis of studies in this review finally there is a reference to the future of polymer adsorbents with the preparation by radiation grafting 2 introduction of polymeric adsorbents with radiation grafting approach polymeric adsorbents can be divided into two categories including polymeric adsorbents based on natural and synthetic polymers 2 1 natural polymer adsorbent today biopolymers like other adsorbents have been developed to adsorb heavy metals gases and various materials 57 biopolymers are composed of natural polymers some of which are common biopolymers such as cellulose chitin chitosan starch and starch based hydrogels lignin aptamer dna binding resin single celled cyanobacteria biomass as microorganisms mixed bark in recent years a lot of research has been done on natural biopolymers and their modifications to remove various heavy ions chitosan alginate cellulose and lignin are known natural polymers that have been used in many cases for water treatment characteristics of different types of biopolymers are shown in table 2 chitosan and cellulose are natural polysaccharides that are the most effective adsorbents for removing heavy metal ions from wastewater chitosan is a versatile polyaminosachride produced by alkaline n deacetylation of chitin involving deproteination and deacetylation chitosan is used to remove heavy metals due to its many adsorption properties such as hydrophobicity biocompatibility degradability non toxicity the presence of highly reactive amino groups and hydroxyl in its backbone modified chitosan can be used to adsorb specific metal ions scientifically chitosan modification is possible due to amino and hydroxyl groups in the main chain 58 chitosan has the property of increasing its metal bonding efficiency by performing chemical modifications with bonding reactants such as ethylene glycondyl glycidyl ether formalehyde glyoxal epichlorohydrin glutaraldehyde and isocyanates 6 cellulose comprises β d glucopyranose repeat units covalently linked by acetal functionalities between the equatorial oh group on the carbon atom c4 and carbon atom c1 hence the name β 1 4 glucan subsequently cellulose has a long direct chain polymer with an enormous number of hydroxyl groups three groups per anhydrous glucose unit agu and a thermodynamically favored conformation 4c1 6 chitosan has different applications in different industries and can be soluble in environmentally friendly solvents one of the applications of chitosan biopolymer is to improve the mechanical properties of sand soil 59 cellulose modification can also be used for hydrophobicity elasticity adsorption of metal ions thermal resistance etc the units that make up the cellulose chain include a primary hydroxyl group and two secondary hydroxyl groups functional groups are attached to these hydroxyl groups 19 the types of cellulose adsorbents have been synthesized to adsorb certain metals such as cellulose g acrylamide hg ii cellulose orange peel citric acid cd ii cellulose g acrylic acid acrylamide cu ii carboxylated polyacrylamide grafted banana stalk pb ii and cd ii 19 cellulose biopolymer is also used to preserve fruits and vegetables because of antioxidants and antibacterial properties in the study of liu and co workers the application of cellulose biopolymer in the food industry has been studied in detail 60 biological adsorption using base biopolymer has attracted a lot of attention the advantages of biological adsorption are low cost high selectivity short time performance easy degradability and availability additionally the solid benefit of biopolymers is that they are sustainable and harmless to the ecosystem for marine frameworks disadvantages include sensitivity to environmental changes by chemically modifying biological adsorbents and combining them with a specific functional group it is possible to achieve the adsorption of metal ions for example by bonding methacrylic acid to titanium dioxide cellulose in the presence of methylenebisacrylamide high adsorption can be achieved for some heavy metals 61 2 2 synthetic polymer adsorbents today various synthetic polymers have been developed in various forms for the base of polymer adsorbents synthetic polymers include polypropylene polyethylene polyethylene terephthalate polyamide polyurethane polytetrafluoroethylene in various forms of nonwoven fabric films fibers hydrogels resins and membranes different monomers are used to modify substrates such as acrylonitrile acrylic acid iminodiacetic acid methacrylic acid glycidyl metaacrylate gma pyrazole derivatives they are very suitable for effluent solutions also increasing the concentration of sulfuric acid is very effective as an additive for the bonding solution various monomers bond with synthetic polymers to remove heavy metals are mentioned in the below section for example a study on grafting copolymerization showed that different mixtures of monomers including acrylonitrile acrylic acid acrylonitrile methacrylic acid acrylonitrile methacrylate glycidyl are suitable for adsorption polymerization 62 okamatoniz and co workers illustrated that poly tfe e tetra fluororthylene co ethylene polypropylene and polyamide showed the highest bond strength 62 in another study pe pp films with a combination of acrylamide and acrylic acid monomers and carboxylic acid and pyridine agents by radiation bonding were studied good results are obtained for removing heavy metal 63 different methods have a unique role in graft polymerization and the creation of suitable polymers the comparison of methods is given in table 3 the following section shows that the reaction design of different co monomers and monomers are attached to various substrates by radiation grafting and are suitable options for the adsorption of heavy metals these adsorbents have been developed in multiple forms of hydrogels resins and particle fibrous fabrics films and membranes 2 2 1 hydrogel adsorbents hydrogels are three dimensional polymer networks with cross over joints that can adsorb a lot of water or biofluids even under pressure these compounds can adsorb large amounts of water without dissolving hydrogels are networked chemically or physically increasing attention is being paid to physiogenic hydrogels because of the overall simplicity of the interaction and the absence of a grid in their synthesis while its substance variations are of interest because of their brilliant mechanical strength in the past few decades hydrogels due to their extraordinary properties in different industries like food packaging drugs agriculture biomedical and bioengineering applications and in the assembling of specialized and electronic devices just as adsorbents for the evacuation of toxins in environmental applications are utilized 64 65 hydrogels are candidates for removing metal ions due to their hydrophilic properties and high swelling ratio however hydrogels have poor mechanical properties in the swelling equilibrium and have a slow reaction time hydrogels with new structures such as comb type hydrogels have fast reaction time and remarkable mechanical properties if these hydrogels are bonded on a polymer matrix such as polyethylene or polypropylene they can be reused and faster than hydrogel reactions 66 radiation induced polymer adsorbents in the form of hydrogels are formed using two methods of radiation induced polymerization and radiation induced crosslinking hydrogel adsorbents are less commonly used as adsorbents for wastewater treatment disadvantages of hydrogels include their poor mechanical strength and low selectivity the high water swelling in them has made them unsuitable as an adsorbent in adsorption columns polymer adsorbents in the form of hydrogels are divided into two categories hydrogel adsorbents based on natural and synthetic polymers natural polymer based hydrogel adsorbents are a type of biosorbent such as cmc gelatin sa carrageenan starch 67 these adsorbents can be synthesized by combining polymers or combining polymers with minerals or combining natural polymers with copolymers of different monomers such as aac aam sss maa amps hema 68 73 for example shawky and co workers grafted aac monomers to k carrageenan by gamma radiation synthesized adsorbents were tested for adsorption of various heavy metals 74 in another study cmc sss hydrogels were synthesized by radiation bonding and tested for adsorption 70 mahmoud and co workers investigated the grafting of paac to cs polymer via gamma ray crosslinking then tio2 nanoparticles are loaded on it the synthesized adsorbent was examined to remove the dye the results showed that the loading of tio2 nanoparticles increased the adsorption capacity 75 the starch was grafted with amps and dmaema under polymerization conditions due to radiation grafting after chemical modification it was tested for adsorption of cobalt and phosphate hydrogels based on synthetic polymers are used to adsorb heavy metals and various materials due to their porous structure their advantage is the ease of construction in different shapes and sizes for example cheng and co workers synthesized amphiphilic gels based on dmaema it was then tested for cr vi uptake after modification with 1 bromoalkanes the results showed that the length of alkyl chains of modifiers affects the adsorption capacity the highest adsorption capacity was 210 5 mg g 76 chen and co workers prepared lipophilic polyelectrolyte gels based on modat and dodecyl acrylate by the polymerization and crosslinking due to radiation grafting lipophilic polyelectrolyte gels can adsorb large amounts of organic solvents with a dielectric constant of less than 20 these gels are capable of high adsorption over a wide range of temperatures 77 2 2 2 granular and resins polymer adsorbents granular and resins polymer adsorbents can be used on a commercial scale due to their large surface area uniform particles and good mechanical strength in these adsorbents polymer particles and resins can be used as a substrate for polymer adsorbents then specific monomers grafted to them by radiation grafting finally after modification with unique functional groups to be used to adsorb heavy metals and various materials the best adsorbent particles are hdpe and evoh particles due to their reasonable price availability high thermal and chemical stability for example du and co workers synthesized a granular polymer adsorbent by irradiating sodium sulfonate on evoh particles and evaluated it as an nh4 adsorbent the maximum adsorption was 22 53 mg g 78 in another study gma was grafted to hdpe particles through radiation induced copolymerization and then modified by n methyl d glucamine to study b ii adsorption the maximum adsorption was 15 63 mg g 79 these adsorbents are often considered on exchange adsorbents in most cases the term refers to separation and disinfection of aqueous solutions and other ion containing solutions with a solid polymer or ion exchange mineral ion exchange methods are based on the reversible exchange of ions between a solution and a solid phase the solid phase is insoluble in water and has groups in the form of acidic or alkaline bases these foundations are the main factors in ion exchange ion exchange resins are of organic origin and are composed of high molecular weight polymers 80 increased graft polymerization alters the properties of the resin in terms of dewatering and ion penetration ion exchangers include two groups of anions and cations ion exchange resins are insoluble polymer matrices these resins contain unstable ions which perform the ion exchange action weak cationic resin can only adsorb alkali cations in water it cannot be used if it requires the adsorption of anions in water a strong anionic resin must be used to adsorb all the anions in the water one of the important advantages of weak anionic resin compared to its strong type is its high resistance therefore in weak water treatment systems the weak anionic resin is more beneficial 81 one of the functional groups considered for anion exchange adsorbents is amin nh2 quaternary phosphonium pr3 quaternary ammonium nr3 tertiary ammonium nr3 cation converters include the rcooh or r so3h groups 2 2 3 fabrics or fibrous adsorbents fibrous fiber sum is a material with flexible and delicate properties it has a longer length than its diameter length ratio to the diameter of the fiber must be more than 1000 to call it fiber fibers are physically short and fragmented or long and one sided they are divided into natural and artificial categories cellulose fibers are one of the most important natural fibers synthetic fibers are called synthetic because they are manufactured today hundreds of types of synthetic fibers are produced around the world by making a slight change in the fabric s nanometer dimensions the arrangement of polymer chains both in natural and synthetic fibers usually creates crystalline or non crystalline and so called amorphous regions the most important properties of fibers are related to the behavior of fibers in tensile and the amount of increase in their length and their behavior against bending properties mechanical fibers these properties are so crucial in many cases and they determine the use of fibers the fibers are always made of polymers that are crystallized the polymers used in the fibers must assemble in a regular arrangement to line up like fibers they can be considered a type of crystal that is very long 82 one of the advantages of fiber adsorbents over granular adsorbents is the ease of recycling on the other hand fiber adsorbents have flexibility low pressure drop and short passage distance to improve the fibers create new properties on the fibers and use them as adsorbents the polymerization technology is used due to radiation grafting of monomers to the surface of the fibers and modifying them with special functional groups fiber adsorbents due to radiation grafting are much more commonly used than particle shaped adsorbents on an industrial scale and in the fixed bed column adsorption experiments 83 the fibers used in fiber adsorbents due to radiation bonding are high molecular weight polyethylene fibers uhmwpe cotton lining pe pp nonwoven fabric and nylon fibers due to their relatively stable surface the long half life strong mechanical properties and corrosion resistance uhmwpe is a suitable substrate for polymer adsorbents due to radiation grafting guven and co workers grafted dmaema monomers on pe pp nwf fibers by polymerization due to radiation grafting they were then modified with dimethyl sulfate and performed adsorption tests to remove phosphate ions for 25 ppm of phosphate the adsorption capacity was 63 mg g and for 1000 ppm the adsorption capacity was 512 mg g 84 in another study dmaema monomers were grafted to pe pp fiber by direct irradiation the adsorption process was investigated for au iii the maximum adsorption capacity was 949 3 mg g 85 kavakli and co workers investigated the grafted vp 4 monomers to pe pp nwf by polymerization the maximum adsorption capacity for as v was reported at ph 7 equal to 98 04 mg g 86 in another study n vinyl 2 pyrrolidone monomers were grafted to pp pe nf by radiation induced graft polymerization by the pri irradiation method iodine uptake capacity was reported to be 1237 8 mg 38 du and co workers investigated the synthesized fibrous adsorbents by quaternary ammonium group gma monomers were grafted to the cotton lining fibers and modified with pentethylene hexamine using electron beams the synthesized adsorbent was examined for phosphate uptake at a concentration of 100 ppm the maximum adsorption capacity was reported to be 130 56 mg g 87 in another study acrylonitrile and acrylic acid monomers were grafted directly to uhmwpe fiber then using hydroxylamine they performed amidoximation to prepare the adsorbent the synthesized adsorbent by radiation grafting was tested to adsorb uranium from seawater the adsorption capacity was obtained equal to 4 54 g kg 88 2 2 4 membrane polymer adsorbents polymeric membrane attractions have become very popular due to their simplicity in design and ease of construction on a commercial scale where molecules are transported through interlayer channels 89 the membrane rejection mechanism is related to its polarity and the affinity between functional group interactions with contaminants 90 91 therefore the surface structures of the films must be modified to improve the membrane rejection capacity the major polymers used in the film industry include polyethylene polypropylene polyvinyl chloride polystyrene polyethylene terephthalate polyamide ethyl vinyl alcohol and polyvinyl chloride films made of different plastics have properties commensurate with the properties of the plastic used the essential features in choosing polymer films include water vapor and oxygen permeability strength and physical strain maximum application temperature cost process ability acceptability of functional groups for metal adsorption special functional groups should modify polymeric membranes according to the membrane type and applications of the adsorption type divided into three categories according to the characteristics of the functional groups anion exchange membrane cation exchange membrane and bipolar membrane the prepared membranes by radiation bonded polymerization are usually anion exchange 92 anion exchange membranes with positive groups and cation exchange membranes with negative groups are activated positive groups like nr3 nr2h nrh2 nh3 imidazole and groups like po3h so3 coo bipolar membranes include both anion and cation exchange groups different types of membranes and ion exchange films due to grafted polymerization are used to remove heavy metals 93 94 for example kim and co workers investigated the sss grafted poly ketone membrane through radiation induced graft polymerization the cation exchange membrane was examined for metal adsorption maximum adsorption was reached 87 95 in another study butyl methacrylate and aac were grafted on ldpe and ppe films it was shown that grafted films have high thermal stability and good hydrophilicity radiation grafted polymer adsorbents were tested for adsorption of copper cobalt and nickel the maximum adsorption was 977 4 mg g 714 3 mg g and 451 mg g respectively 96 in another study nipaam and aac were grafted using gamma radiation on polypropylene films by one step and two step methods the polymer film prepared by radiation grafted was tested for copper adsorption in an acidic environment the maximum adsorption reached 337 mg g 97 also glycidyl methacrylate monomers were bonded by irradiation to a pvdf membrane the grafting membrane was then modified with sodium sulfite polymeric membranes prepared by radiation grafting were tested for oil removal irradiation grafted polymer films have been shown to have good potential for oil removal from water 98 hamzah and co workers investigated the irradiated ptfe films with electron beams the irradiated film was then placed in a monomeric solution of acrylic acid the results showed that the hydrophilicity of the adsorbent obtained from the polymerization of the graft due to radiation was increased the grafted membranes were evaluated for adsorption of lead ions 99 3 methods of radiation grafting ionizing radiation is used to produce active radicals on the substrate that can be attached to various monomers therefore it produces monomeric polymer chains on the substrate surface there are different types of radiation alpha beta x rays gamma protons and neutron particles but the two types of radiation most used in this field are beta radiation and gamma radiation the charge and mass of the radiative particle depend on the state of the material density temperature and other factors of the target material the influence of rays on the properties and performance of each polymer is different which is due to their absolute and inherent sensitivity in the original structure of the polymer all materials in high radiation have a tolerance threshold above which the material will fail 100 the radiation induced graft polymerization is known as a modification technique of existing porous polymeric membranes the simple illustration between grafting performed by a gardener and a radiation chemist is shown in fig 2 cutting a branch and creating a graft on the tree by the gardener causes the fruits of the tree to grow optimally and the weather conditions and poor soil do not affect the fertility of the tree electron beams or gamma rays generate free radicals that can be bonded by carefully designing different monomers these functionalized bonds give a unique ability as a chemical adsorbent or catalyst for the structure limited polymer crosslinking in polymers by radiation bonding method is possible depending on the availability of radiation sources required production amount monomer reaction and sensitivity of the main body of the polymer to radiation and material conditions in two ways direct method and indirect method in both methods of beam bonding to obtain uniform bond efficiency it is essential to achieve the optimal combinations of reaction parameters which fall into two classes parameters directly are related to the radiation source type of radiation source dose and dose rate also they are related to the bond mixture include the sort of polymer base sort of monomer sort of diluent solvent the concentration of monomer reaction time and temperature among the reaction parameters the diluent solvent plays a key role in influencing the access of the monomer to the bonding sites and the bonding mechanism including inception proliferation of the developing chain and end hence it dominantly affects the degree of entrance and consistency nasef and co workers reported for the first time an optimization study for transplant parameters and prediction of transplant performance in the radiation transplant method using the response surface method rsm the use of rsm is a valuable tool to achieve the desired link benefit which has minimized the number of tests and reduced the cost 101 radiation grafting is a simple and helpful way to modify the properties of synthetic and natural polymer layers this method offers immediate benefits to a person that is superior to the usual chemical method and is no primer additive guarantees high purity of the product without impurities and unwanted groups it is possible to radiate polymerization of any monomer in solid liquid gas form polymers sensitive to the thermal process of room temperature can be produced it is possible to disinfect the product for biomaterials simultaneously this process can be controlled by optimizing radiant parameters such as dose etc high polymer efficiency is possible in bonded polymerization ability to combine two incompatible substances do not cause problems in the direction of the specific form of the adsorbent radiation grafting can be classified into five classes based on the type of intermediate 101 1 solvent mediated grafting in a solvent coupled copolymer bond polar and non polar solvents such as dilchromethane and toluene are added to the bonding mixture to enhance and facilitate monomer diffusion into the polymer this method is used in most rigp methods 2 emulsion mediated grafting in this method the monomer is added to the polymer after dilution with water and a small amount of surfactant such as tween this method offers significant advantages in reducing the radiation dose and consuming less monomer so it is economical 3 atomic transfer radical polymerization atrp mediated grafting an atrp catalyst agent enables the monomer to initiate a growing polymer chain and can withstand large amounts of impurities 4 reversible addition fragmentation chain transfer raft mediated grafting 5 nitroxide mediated grafting nitroxide is added to the monomer to stabilize the active radicals by a new reversible radical compound with nitroxide function it increases the balance between the radical growth of the chain and the end radicals coated with the nitroxide molecule 102 3 1 direct irradiation method in this method the monomer and the substrate are irradiated simultaneously one of the advantages of this method is that it has a grafting stage and can lead to a higher degree of grafting dog however this method can lead to large amounts of homopolymers and chemical wastes it is controlled by adding inhibitors or applying lower radiation dose rates however since mohr s salt reduces grafting efficiency an alternative method can be used to use styrene in a monomeric solution in this method the concentration of monomers m is much higher than the concentration of radicals on the substrate s as a result the radical concentration in the monomeric solution m is greater than s therefore based on the following reactions as shown in eqs 1 to 3 the probability of a reaction between m and m is much higher than that of a reaction with other species 1 m m m2 2 m m m2 3 m s m s in this method to increase the number of radicals formed in the bed compared to the inside of the monomeric solution higher temperature allows more diffusion of radical monomers and more growth of monomer chains with the radicals of the bed surface of course it can damage the reaction 103 3 2 indirect irradiation method in this method the substrate is irradiated in an inert atmosphere or vacuum or air after irradiation a monomeric solution is added to the substrate to allow the formed radicals in the substrate to react with the monomers this method reduces the rate of hemopolymerization compared to the direct irradiation method it has been shown that this technique produces less chemical waste and requires less primary monomer in addition grafted substrates are easier to wash to remove homopolymers and excess monomers in contrast the method is more complex in this method to protect more free radicals it is necessary to irradiate the bed at a low temperature before being placed in the monomeric solution the concentration of radicals in this system is not as high as the concentration of radicals in indirect irradiation also in this method the degree of grafting is lower 3 3 radiation grafting on polymers in different atmospheres 3 3 1 radiation under atmosphere when the polymer is irradiated under normal atmospheric conditions the presence of oxygen in the solution or around the sample during irradiation can disrupt the test oxygen is a highly reactive molecule that interacts with radicals formed on the surface of a polymer or monomer to form peroxide radicals leading to the suppression of radicals in some cases can be used for radiation grafting in a system containing polymer r oxygen reactions may occur that indicate the quenching of polymer radicals that can be used to continue the polymerization process 4 r o 2 r o 2 other reactions that may occur in this regard are as follows 5 r o 2 r h ro 2 h r 6 r o 2 r o 2 roor o 2 3 3 2 radiation under nitrous oxide during irradiation of an aqueous solution aqueous electrons and hydroxyl radicals are produced in the solution hydroxyl radicals play an important role in generating radical sites on the polymer column of a substrate for polymerization of bonded radiation to initiate the reaction by decomposing hydrogen from the polymer column or reacting with carbon carbon double bonds to initiate polymerization as a result the high concentration of hydroxyl in the solution during irradiation favour the final dog of the system and create many places for polymerization injection of nitrous oxide into the sample glass before irradiation allows the aqueous electrons to be converted to nitrogen gas and hydroxyl radicals by the following equation 7 e aq n 2 o n 2 o h 2 o n 2 oh oh the reaction between aqueous electrons and nitrous oxide is very fast thus allowing most aqueous electrons to be converted to hydroxyl radicals before they have a chance to react with other molecules in the aqueous system 3 3 3 radiation under inert atmosphere when irradiated under an inert atmosphere the presence of oxygen during irradiation can be ignored so interactions with different materials occur when using a non aqueous solution radiation under an inert atmosphere is beneficial for direct and indirect irradiation oxygen removal from an indirect irradiation system also allows radicals created on the fabric s surface to remain on the fabric until a monomeric solution is added to the vial it allows for a higher percentage of radicals generated to form bonded copolymers on the fabric surface increasing the final dog of the system for a direct bonding system using a non aqueous solution an inert atmosphere will limit the interaction of the radicals with other layers of the fabric 4 review of irradiated adsorbent studies many monomers have been studied in irradiation induced graft polymerization as shown in fig 3 and the primary reaction schemes of monomers for the preparation of adsorbents are shown in fig 4 in the following several studies for the removal of heavy metals including the parameters of irradiation method dose amount type of monomer and functional group adsorption amount and operating conditions of the adsorption process are described in table 4 4 1 adsorbent surface properties after preparing the adsorbents the characteristics of the adsorbent surface in terms of roughness contact surface angle and hydrophilicity and hydrophobic properties are analyzed by sem edx afm and other tests 104 for several decades modification of adsorbent surfaces has been considered to increase hydrophilic properties and increase adsorption for example shaimaa and co workers examined the adsorbent surface through sem after preparing environmentally friendly adsorbents the resulting analysis showed nodular protrusions on the synthesized adsorbent surface nzvi which was improved by silt clay modification sc nzvi to improve the physical properties of the surface 105 the contact angle test is generally used to show the hydrophilicity of the adsorbent surface membrane and fibers the smaller contact angle shows the more hydrophilic properties in the adsorbent according to studies by wenzel and co workers increasing the surface roughness enhances its wettability 106 in other words increasing the roughness of the hydrophilic surface always makes it hydrophilic while increasing the roughness of the hydrophobic surface leads to its hydrophobicity according to studies by wenzel et al in studies on polymer adsorbents due to the grafting of the radiation the grafting of monomers to the polymer surface often increases the surface roughness of the adsorbent it causes more hydrophobic on the other hand the radiation polymerization process in radiation induced polymer adsorbents due to the type of grafted monomer and modification with functional groups often reduces the contact surface angle which studies by nasef and co workers and other researchers 107 109 as another example fatahiyah and co workers investigated the grafted poly hea to the polymer surface of pvdf by pre irradiation method after analyzing the grafted polymer surface they observed that the surface roughness has increased and also the contact surface angle has decreased which means that the hydrophilicity of the polymer has increased after analyzing the afm images which show dark depressed valleys or pores and bright nodules of the surface they found that the unmodified pvdf has more bright nodules during the darker valleys on grafted pvdf 110 these findings are consistent with studies by other researchers 107 111 113 on the other hand the characteristics of the adsorbent surface such as specific surface area polarity and surface porosity are influential factors in the adsorption process surface porosity and the presence of a large surface area per unit mass are essential for the adsorbent in order to prepare polymeric adsorbents different monomers are grafted to different substrates in different shapes and then the grafted polymers are modified by suitable materials to remove different materials a noteworthy point in radiation grafted polymer adsorbents is the degree of radiation it is related to the specific surface of the adsorbent and is a very important factor in increasing the adsorption rate for example xu and co workers investigated the grafted acrylonitrile and acrylic acid monomers to the pe pp polymer substrate by irradiation and then modified them with amidoxy groups the bet surface area of the pe pp and pe pp g paac co pan fibers arrived at 4 3 and 3 7 m2 g respectively it inferred that the pe pp fibers were relatively rough compared to the pe pp g paac co pan fibers contrasted to the bet surface area of the pe pp fibers that of the pe pp g paac co pao fibers arrived at 6 4 m2 g addressing an increment of 48 8 which suggested that expanding the particular surface region will facilitate the extraction 55 due to its particular surface area and a higher degree of grafting radiation grafted polymer nanofibers have received much attention in separation processes abbasi and co workers used an electrospinning process to fabricate a polymer nanofiber then bonded gma monomers to it irradiated it with radiation and finally modified the bonded polymer with amine groups bet analysis showed that with increasing the degree of grafting from 150 to 300 the total pore volume of the samples decreased from 0 009 to 0 006 cm3 g however it is worth noting that these very low values are related to intra fiber pores revealing an almost solid non porous structure of single fibers bet investigation showed that with expanding the degree of grafting from 150 to 300 the total pore volumes diminished from 0 009 to 0 006 cm3 g nonetheless it is significant that these extremely low qualities are identified with intra fiber pores uncovering a practically strong non permeable construction of single fibers 114 4 2 effect of synthesis parameters monomers play an essential role in the adsorption of heavy metals from solutions and the formation of specific functional groups in the adsorbent some monomers such as acrylic acid acrylamide maleic acid and demylaminomethyl methacrylate tend to hemopolymerize during the irradiation process due to their chemical properties since the amount of homopolymer formed in the direct irradiation method is much higher using the indirect irradiation method is better when using these monomers on the other hand with increasing the concentration of monomer more grafting takes place however by increasing the monomer concentration too much the homopolymerization process competes with the polymerization process and reduces the graft performance 115 solvents are often used to dissolve monomers and increase monomer access to bond sites various studies have constantly shown that each particular solvent results in better graft performance for example for acrylic acid monomer water is the most suitable solvent 116 117 also in various studies tween 20 surfactant with water as an emulsion for gma monomer and dmf solvents for an monomer and dioxan solvent has been used for an aac monomers 118 120 the surface irradiation of this polymer has been investigated with various monomers the results of studies are reported in table 5 to extract uranium ions from an aqueous solution and seawater various dose rates are used in the radiation induced graft polymerization process the different dose rates have a significant impact on the properties of adsorbents with the increase in the dose rate the amounts of radical on the surface and the degree of grafting increase in the preparation procedure these conditions are not known as favorable conditions for the adsorption of heavy metals because the adsorption process of heavy metals is mainly done with a polymer adsorbent surface and increasing the bonding degrees in the adsorbent pores does not always help increase the adsorption capacity a comparison of different adsorbents in terms of gamma ray or electron beam dose is shown in table 6 the constituent elements in the polymeric substrate are closely related to the raw materials used for its preparation the proportions of polypropylene polyethylene and other polymeric materials affect the elemental composition of radiated induced graft adsorbents tables 7 and 8 list the differences in the elements contained in adsorbent made from various polymeric materials for uranium and thorium adsorption from aqueous solution mesoporous adsorbents such as sba 15 mcm 41 mcm 48 have a higher surface area and high porosity than polymer adsorbents due to radiation 121 122 however transfer limitations due to pore blockage can significantly reduce the surface area on the other hand the method of preparing these attractions is much more difficult titanium hydrogen oxide as a mesoporous adsorbent has lower strength and lower adsorption capacity than synthetic polymer adsorbents although it is difficult to compare the adsorption capacity between hydrogen titanium oxide and polymer adsorbents due to different test conditions it is observed that the adsorption capacity of these adsorbents is in the range of 0 025 to 1 2 for uranium adsorption 123 125 therefore the radiation grafting polymer adsorbents are more appropriate for uranium uptake as shown in table 7 different methods characterize the synthesized adsorbents each technique can provide significant answers in determining the essential adsorbent parameters and the effects of monomers and the radiation grafting polymerization the most important analysis methods are summarized in fig 5 hegazy and el rehim synthesized membranes with anion and cation exchangers experiments were performed on radiation grafting copolymerization of anionic and cationic binary monomers in this adsorbent acrylic acid and vinyl pyridine monomers are grafted on low density polyethylene polymer substrates by radiation grafting the prepared grafting membrane was examined for the adsorption of heavy metals such as lead zinc iron and a mixture of metals for specific metal selectivity different adsorbent synthesis conditions such as the combined ratio of monomers monomer concentration solvent type and radiation dose effects were analyzed the maximum adsorption capacity of zinc and cobalt was 147 mg g and 116 mg g respectively 126 in another study gamma irradiation was used to graft acrylic acid and 2 hydroxyethyl methacrylate hema comonomers on a polyethylene substrate in the presence of inhibitory salts and methanol and water solvents grafting performance was optimized according to the ratio of monomers monomer concentration and radiation dose the optimum degree of grafting was 289 at a monomer concentration of 20 and a monomeric ratio of hema aac 90 10 and a radiation dose of 30 kgy the adsorption capacity of this adsorbent was 96 6 mg g in an acidic medium ph 5 with an initial concentration of 500 ppm 7 in the study of kavaklı p a and o güven graft n n dipropionitrile and acrylamide on polyethylene coated polypropylene nonwoven fabric by radiation grafting for adsorption of uranium lead copper and cobalt at high concentrations was examined with batch experiments adsorption studies of metal ions with different initial concentrations 100 1500 ppm were performed the studies showed that the interaction between metal ions and amidoximized groups is in good agreement with the langmuir isotherm the amount of metal adsorption for the adsorbent was cu2 co2 uo2 2 pb2 127 in the study of kumar and co workers acrylonitrile monomers were grafted on a polypropylene substrate by grafting irradiation under an electron beam with an energy of 2 mev it was then chemically modified with hydroxylamine in this study the effect of different experimental variables such as radiation dose rate temperature and solvent composition was investigated polypropylene grafted with amidoxime group amo g pp was investigated for adsorption of heavy metal ions such as manganese cobalt nickel and cadmium the adsorption results were obtained as mn2 ni2 co2 cd2 the results showed that the equilibrium adsorption capacity of adsorbents in solutions containing metal ions 128 the pe g pssa adsorbent was investigated by simultaneous irradiation of styrene divinylbenzene onto low density polyethylene film followed by sulfonation to adsorb cobalt copper nickel lead and silver based on batch processes the influence of various parameters such as contact time initial metal ion concentration ph and solution temperature on membrane adsorption capacity was investigated this study showed that the percentage of metal ions adsorption strongly depends on the initial concentration of metal ions and ph the adsorption of metal ions mentioned in this adsorbent is independent of the temperature of the solution the maximum adsorption capacity of metal ions was obtained ag2 pb2 cu2 co2 ni2 129 the removal of cobalt nickel metal ions was investigated by adsorbents poly 1 vinyl 2 pyrrolidone co sodium acrylate they were synthesized by radiation grafting by gamma rays the effect of comonomer composition ratio their concentration and radiation dose on metal adsorption was investigated in addition the effect of adsorption conditions such as contact time ph and initial ion solution concentration on the metal ion binding capacity to the adsorbent was studied the maximum adsorption values for cobalt copper and nickel were 450 81 mg g 425 60 mg g 93 01 mg g respectively 130 przybytniak and co workers were studied the grafted acrylic acid and acrylamide monomers on a polypropylene filter by gamma rays at a dose of 10 kgy the aim of this study was the role of selected monomers in the adsorption of europium the carboxyl groups in the adsorbent increase the hydrophobicity of the polymer polypropylene matrix and increase the affinity for cation adsorption different synthesis and adsorption conditions were investigated in this study it seems that the bonded inner layers do not play an influential role in adsorption and the functional groups on the outer surface of the adsorbent play an essential role in the adsorption of metal ions 131 in the study of kumar and co workers gma monomers were deposited on nonwoven fibers by electron beam induced radiation grafting at a dose of 30 kgy then using different amines the chemical modification was performed and studied for copper adsorption fig 6 shows the structure of corrective adsorbents with different amines the amines used in this study are ethylene diamine eda diethylene acetaminophen deta triethylene tetramine teta tetraethylene pentamine tepa in which case modification with ethylene diamine is the best result for metal adsorption as a result maximum equilibrium adsorption was obtained equal to 50 mg g 12 the synthesis of a new adsorbent for cesium removal from the pollution water is shown in fig 7 it is observed that the new selective adsorbent by introducing ammonium 12 molybdophosphate onto pp nonwoven fabric with rigp method 132 5 continuous condition for adsorption adsorption processes are usually performed into continuous moving bed continuous fixed bed continuous fluidized bed on an industrial scale a fixed bed column is preferable for adsorption processes fixed bed columns are used in most separation processes based on adsorption to remove contaminants or treat wastewater 133 the schematic of the adsorption process in the fixed bed column is shown in fig 8 in these columns the inlet feed enters the column environment and the adsorbent quickly begins to adsorb the surface by the top layers of fresh adsorbent the mass transfer zone mtz is initially located near the top 134 most of the mass transfer takes place in this area in this region mass transfer from the fluid to solid the desired adsorbent occurs at the upper edge of this region the concentration of adsorbate is equal to the initial concentration of the inlet while at the lower edge of this region the concentration of adsorbate in the fluid phase is zero when the lower edge of this region reaches the end of the adsorbent the concentration of adsorbate increases rapidly in the fluid leaving the adsorbent this time is called breakthrough time the mass transfer zone proceeds at a different velocity from the fluid velocity along the column the mass transfer region extends to the column until c c 0 1 the mass transfer region is calculated with the relation zm z 1 tb te in this equation zm and z are the mass transfer zone s height and the bed s height respectively 135 by measuring the concentration of adsorbate in the outlet of the column and plotting this concentration over time a curve called the breakthrough curve is obtained 136 137 the shape of this curve is usually s in shape with different degrees of sharpness by examining this curve the efficiency of the column is obtained the important parameters in the performance of a column are the initial concentration of the adsorbate the flow rate of the adsorbate in the column the height of the column the ph of the adsorbate and the size of the adsorbent particles 134 also different mathematical models such as thomas model 138 adam bohart model and yoon nelson model are used to study the column performance the different mathematical models for the description of the continuous adsorption experiments is described in table 9 the initial concentration parameter of the adsorbate material is one of the most important parameters in the design of fixed bed column systems it can be said that with an increasing initial concentration of adsorbate exhaustion and breakpoints occur earlier this phenomenon is because at the beginning of adsorption due to the presence of many empty sites in the bed adsorption occurs rapidly increasing the initial concentration leads to more driving force this driving force destroys the resistance to mass transfer from the liquid phase to the adsorbent so the sites evacuate quickly here the driving force is the concentration difference between the fluid and the adsorbent the more diluted solution showed less driving force and lower adsorption capacity so in solutions with higher concentrations the slope of the breakthrough curve is greater and the exhaustion and breakpoints occur in a shorter time 139 regarding the adsorbent height parameter it should be said that the exhaustion and break times occur later with increasing height and also the volume of treated effluent increases with increasing bed depth the reason for this is that as the bed height increases the area of the bond area and the number of empty sites for adsorption increases and also the time of interaction of the adsorbate material increases with increasing the amount of adsorbent 140 141 the flow rate parameter is one of the important parameters in the design of the fixed bed column which with the increase of the flow rate the breakpoint occurs faster the rate of mass transfer from the liquid phase to the solid phase increases with increasing flow rate the amount of adsorbed material per unit height of the bed mtz area increases which shortens the saturation time because at lower flow rates the adsorbate has more time to contact the adsorbent which eliminates more adsorbate in the column 142 144 the solution ph parameter is also very important in column design some contaminants are adsorbed more at acidic ph and some have the highest adsorption at alkaline ph this parameter depends on the type of adsorbent and the nature of the adsorbate 145 ting and co workers investigated boron removal from real industrial wastewater containing high concentrations of ammonia using a fibrous adsorbent containing glucamine groups the adsorbent was prepared from the glycidyl methacrylate gma emulsion radiation grafting on nylon 6 fibers and then treated with n methyl d glucamine nmdg the adsorbent performance obtained for boron adsorption was tested at different flow rates using a fixed bed column the data obtained from the fixed bed column were analyzed using three common mathematical models such as yoon nelson thomas and modified dose response mdr models the results of breakthrough curves are better suited to the mdr model the synthesized adsorbent showed the necessary stability after five adsorption desorption cycles according to the results it was observed that this adsorbent has the necessary ability to remove boron 146 dong and co workers studied combining the advantages of cellulose and ionic liquid the ionic liquid functionalized cellulose ilfc as a radiation grafting adsorbent in this study glycidyl methacrylate was grafted onto cellulose microsphere by radiation the reaction was then performed with ionic liquid 1 aminopropyl 3 methyl imidazolium nitrate and the adsorbent was prepared the properties of this adsorbent in cr vi adsorption were investigated by batch and columnar experiments in batch experiments the adsorption kinetics were fitted with a pseudo second order mode with equilibrium time of 2 h and ph 2 the adsorption capacity reached 181 8 mg g in the fixed bed column both yoon nelson and thomas models were consistent with the experimental data and breakthrough curves also in the column experiments the equilibrium adsorption capacity calculated by the thomas model was 161 mg g this adsorbent also showed high selectivity to cr vi adsorption desorption tests also showed that the adsorbent was used several times without reducing its adsorption capacity 147 a comparative study investigated the selective removal of boron from aqueous solutions on a fibrous adsorbent and diaion crb03 granular resin in a fixed bed column the fibrous adsorbent was prepared by binding vinylbenzyl chloride vbc on nylon 6 fibers and then treated with n methyl d glucamine nmdg the effect of changes in space velocities sv on breakthrough curves was investigated it was observed that the mdr model was in good agreement with the experimental adsorption data of both adsorbents the fibrous adsorbent had a higher adsorption capacity than the resin grains in all space velocities sv the adsorbed boron was washed using 0 1 m hcl and the reduced adsorbent remained constant after ten adsorption desorption cycles the author and his colleagues observed that the fibrous adsorbent prepared in this experiment performed better than diaion crb03 granular resin indicating the high capacity of this adsorbent to remove boron from aqueous solutions in the laboratory and industrial rolls 148 vijayasri and co workers studied chitosan a natural biopolymer to remove arsenic from groundwater chitosan was modified with 2 hydroxyethylmethacrylate hema and sodium styrene sulfonate sss the maximum removal percentage of as v occurred at an input concentration of 60 mg l at 1 ml min rate and ph 3 5 and a bed depth of 3 cm the bonded adsorbent used in the fixed bed column was reduced with 0 1 m naoh and the adsorbent remained stable for up to 8 adsorption desorption cycles 149 lopez and co workers studied metal ion adsorbents which have amino and iminodiacetic groups produced by glycidyl methacrylate gma beam grafting on polypropylene non woven fabric synthesis was performed by the reaction of epoxide functional groups with ethylenediamine or iminodiacetic acid based on the results of batch and column adsorption experiments amino and iminodiacetic adsorbents performed well to remove cr vi and cd ii respectively the amino adsorbent was reduced with 2 m naoh solution and the iminodiacetic type adsorbent was reduced by organic acids such as citric acetic and oxalic acids it was observed that both adsorbents had more than 94 adsorption efficiency the adsorbents remained stable in five consecutive adsorption desorption cycles breakthrough curves were plotted in different streams of feed the amino type adsorbent packed in the column can purify 1500 ml of 3 ppm cr vi solution finally it was observed that the amino type adsorbent was successfully used in the actual wastewater treatment and the effluents obtained were by national standards 150 sarala and co workers examined the performance of an adsorbent in a fixed bed column this adsorbent was obtained by glycidyl methacrylate gma grafting by electron beam irradiation on banana fibers the obtained adsorbent was used to adsorb acid blue 80 ab80 the influence of flow rate bed height and inlet concentration was analyzed this experiment showed that increasing the bed height and inlet concentration increase the efficiency of the adsorbent the maximum adsorption capacity was obtained for a bed with a 5 ml min flow rate and an input concentration of 100 mg l and a height of 50 mm 45 19 mg g it was observed that the thomas model had the closest result to the behavior of breakthrough curves 151 6 future perspectives the market needs to commercialize are the most important part of achieving a targeted product a schematic of the transfer procedure from the market to commercial stage for synthetic adsorbents is shown in fig 9 of course the irradiation process the increase in costs the advantages of grafting the specific driving force to achieve the goal are fundamental in selecting a suitable adsorbent uranium uptake was studied in 1984 in japan by the method of grafting irradiation in this method acrylonitrile adsorbents were grafted to the polyethylene fibers under irradiation and the surface was treated with amiodioxime groups economic evaluation of adsorbent production with the aim of adsorbing 2 g of uranium per kilogram of adsorbent repetition period equal to 6 times and adsorption time in the range of 60 days and 360 days for operations were considered the evaluation results are shown in figs 10 and 11 according to the figures 82 of the costs are for the supply of pe polymers and used chemicals therefore high prices are required in the process of synthesis of adsorbent and its production on the other hand the adsorbent can only be recycled in six steps and it is necessary to provide an incinerator to eliminate it which is associated with environmental pollution the type of used solvent such as dimethylformamide also increases the number of environmental pollutants therefore the challenge of producing an adsorbent by reducing costs and reducing the load of environmental pollutants is still in the path of research and development therefore low cost and high efficiency for heavy metals are exceptional characteristics that make rigp polymers attractive adsorbents with increased demand for the preparation of various functional monomers the new approaches aim to understand better the mechanisms of the interaction between heavy metals and the adsorbents and in line with the above and environmental applications to develop new monomers that allow an increase in the selectivity parameter to remove heavy metal ions from wastewater 7 conclusion the discharge of wastewater including heavy metals from many different industrial processes to the environment has been on the rise the removal of them from wastewater has been developed using various techniques a detailed review of severing the radiation induced grafted polymerization adsorbents is discussed in this paper which reveals an excellent potential for the separation of heavy metal ions from aqueous solutions the radiation induced graft polymerization has revolutionized polymeric adsorbents due to the presence of monomers ligands extractants on the surface of polymers with the creation of large surface area and low mass transfer resistance radiation induced grafting polymerization is performed by both direct and indirect methods in the direct method the polymer substrate is irradiated simultaneously in the monomeric solution and in the indirect method the polymer substrate is irradiated first then placed in the monomeric solution a relatively large amount of homopolymer is formed in the indirect procedure indirect techniques can store the radicals produced by electron beam or gamma ray this procedure is effective for the mass production of polymeric adsorbents because the irradiation process and grafting process are separable an appropriate choice of the form of a polymeric adsorbent contributes to an increment in the overall adsorption rate gamma ray is the most abundant economic source for the synthesis which usually uses the lower values for the dose rate the review also suggested that the adsorption capacity of polymeric adsorbent improved with increasing the grafting percentage the production of polymeric adsorbents with high selectivity and adsorption efficiency at a low cost is still a significant challenge environmental effects are reduced and increased by the use of unconventional solvents and the burning of the spent adsorbents this challenge can be reduced only by properly considering environmentally friendly solvents suitable monomers and long term use of the new adsorbents declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper acknowledgment the authors would like to thank the international atomic energy agency for the technical support of this project under

13276,wastewater treatment remains a fundamental issue worldwide to date despite different technological progressions and breakthroughs the wastewater including heavy metal ions represents an extraordinary danger to human health if untreated appropriately making its removal of the most extreme significance among various wastewater treatment approaches adsorption is the most common method to remove heavy metals due to its flexible design operation and cost effectiveness adsorption with novel materials is progressively acquiring fame because of many important highlights like wastewater treatment under various conditions the polymeric adsorbent is the most ordinary adsorbent to eliminate heavy metal ions in wastewater inferable from the simplicity of surface functionalization the various aspects of radiation induced graft polymeric adsorbents and their preparation and application are introduced a list of adsorbents with adsorption capacity and experimental conditions are compiled the findings clarified the roles and advantages of these adsorbents for remediation and wastewater treatment process due to high selectivity providing by radiation induced graft polymerization a productive and minimal expense large surface area and excellent mechanical strength the economic application related to radiation induced graft polymeric adsorbents is also suggested

growth and industries climate change and lack of proper management has caused problems for the international community 1 2 therefore treatment of contaminated water and wastewater including a variety of emerging pollutants including metals dyes biodegradable waste phosphates and nitrates hazardous and toxic chemicals radioactive pollutants pharmaceuticals and personal care products 3 5 is an inevitable necessity recently the study of removing metal ions from aqueous solutions has become significant to control contamination or recover spent materials 6 the increasing upgrades of different industries such as metal plating facilities mining operations fertilizer industries tanneries batteries paper and pesticides industries increase the entry of toxic heavy metals into the environment their presence has caused environmental hazards 7 most heavy metals are toxic metals that harm on the internal organs of the body 8 the passage of heavy metals into the natural cycle of the climate makes them enter the human body and cause different infections 9 different physical chemical and biological mechanisms for removing heavy metals from aqueous solutions are known filtration 10 and membrane processes 11 ion exchange 12 chemical precipitation 13 coagulation 14 and flocculation 15 floating 16 electrochemical treatment 17 photocatalyst 18 and adsorption 19 chemical precipitation is the normally utilized cycle for the removal of heavy metals from inorganic effluents relying upon the ph change in a basic solution the chemical precipitation inconveniences are complex the release of an excessive amount of too much sludge produced needs additional treatments coagulation flocculation is additionally utilized to handle wastewaters by adding a coagulant in the coagulation interaction nonetheless this treatment has the chance of weakening colloidal particles and in this manner bringing about sedimentation 20 21 different effluent treatment processes for heavy metal ions are associated with advantages and disadvantages a comparison of which is given in table 1 among the mentioned methods for removing heavy metals from effluent solutions one of the suitable methods with high efficiency and environmentally friendly is the adsorption method 22 among the two adsorption mechanisms the advantages of physical adsorption over chemical adsorption are high selectivity of adsorbents less environmental pollution and adsorption of particles by a particular surface in a substrate however in the process of chemical adsorption the adsorbent is not selectable as a result all the volume of used solvents in the unit is involved in the adsorption process the desorption process is also more straightforward in physical adsorption systems today many adsorbents have been developed that can adsorb heavy metal ions still the development of high adsorption levels and high adsorption speed such as nano porous material or polymeric adsorbents is becoming more and more critical 23 27 the different types of adsorbents in a category are shown in fig 1 at present various polymers natural and synthetic induced by radiation 28 31 in multiple forms of membranes 32 33 resins 34 hydrogels 35 fibers 36 and fibrous fabrics 37 39 have been developed with specific functional groups radiation techniques for adsorbent preparation have two primary systems a adjustment of polymeric or mineral materials by radiation induced graft copolymerization b synthesis of polymer gel hydrogel by crosslinking of radiation that crosslinking alludes to the binding of polymer chains by gamma radiation or electron beam 40 organic hydrogels or gels can be synthesized by radiation crosslinking 41 42 the notable provisions of radiation induced crosslinking are process control no compelling reason to add initiators hydrogel formation and sanitization in one step capacity to deliver gel particles with various measurements and designs by changing radiation boundaries 43 useful copolymers with modification of existing polymers due to high adsorption capacity and high selectivity of accepting functional groups as ligands to form bonds with metal ions in solutions have received much attention 44 46 crosslinked and modified polymer adsorbents are most interested in removing heavy metals from effluent solutions for the following reasons 1 polymeric adsorbents have a high adsorption capacity and their selectivity to remove the target material increases with special ligands 2 functional groups can easily be added to polymer chains to increase adsorption capacity 3 durability and flexibility of the polymer 4 different forms of polymer adsorbents can be prepared in large quantities 47 49 meanwhile the radiation induced graft method has been prevalent for combining different types of polymers with various functional groups such as amin nh2 nhr nhr2 nr3 quaternary phosphonium pr3 hydroxyl oh carboxylic coo sulfunate so3 phophate po oh 2 thiol sh nitrile cn schiff base rc n amide conh2 amidoxime nh2 noh etc 50 56 the specific review on the adsorption of heavy metals with polymeric adsorbents is not illustrated in the literature it would give essential experiences into the plan of new specific adsorbents towards heavy metal ions and comprehend their adsorption mechanisms the purpose of this paper is to consider the advantages of polymeric adsorbents prepared by radiation induced grafting polymerization it explains in detail the methods of radiation induced grafting polymerization in two ways of direct and indirect irradiation using different irradiations under different operating conditions this method facilitates and improves the grafting of monomers to polymer substrates in this study different types of polymer adsorbents are investigated the studies of polymer adsorbents due to radiation bonding for adsorption of heavy metals under adsorbent synthesis conditions such as irradiation method dose amount monomer type and functional groups and adsorption process operating conditions are reviewed the literature survey from the last 20 years is the basis of studies in this review finally there is a reference to the future of polymer adsorbents with the preparation by radiation grafting 2 introduction of polymeric adsorbents with radiation grafting approach polymeric adsorbents can be divided into two categories including polymeric adsorbents based on natural and synthetic polymers 2 1 natural polymer adsorbent today biopolymers like other adsorbents have been developed to adsorb heavy metals gases and various materials 57 biopolymers are composed of natural polymers some of which are common biopolymers such as cellulose chitin chitosan starch and starch based hydrogels lignin aptamer dna binding resin single celled cyanobacteria biomass as microorganisms mixed bark in recent years a lot of research has been done on natural biopolymers and their modifications to remove various heavy ions chitosan alginate cellulose and lignin are known natural polymers that have been used in many cases for water treatment characteristics of different types of biopolymers are shown in table 2 chitosan and cellulose are natural polysaccharides that are the most effective adsorbents for removing heavy metal ions from wastewater chitosan is a versatile polyaminosachride produced by alkaline n deacetylation of chitin involving deproteination and deacetylation chitosan is used to remove heavy metals due to its many adsorption properties such as hydrophobicity biocompatibility degradability non toxicity the presence of highly reactive amino groups and hydroxyl in its backbone modified chitosan can be used to adsorb specific metal ions scientifically chitosan modification is possible due to amino and hydroxyl groups in the main chain 58 chitosan has the property of increasing its metal bonding efficiency by performing chemical modifications with bonding reactants such as ethylene glycondyl glycidyl ether formalehyde glyoxal epichlorohydrin glutaraldehyde and isocyanates 6 cellulose comprises β d glucopyranose repeat units covalently linked by acetal functionalities between the equatorial oh group on the carbon atom c4 and carbon atom c1 hence the name β 1 4 glucan subsequently cellulose has a long direct chain polymer with an enormous number of hydroxyl groups three groups per anhydrous glucose unit agu and a thermodynamically favored conformation 4c1 6 chitosan has different applications in different industries and can be soluble in environmentally friendly solvents one of the applications of chitosan biopolymer is to improve the mechanical properties of sand soil 59 cellulose modification can also be used for hydrophobicity elasticity adsorption of metal ions thermal resistance etc the units that make up the cellulose chain include a primary hydroxyl group and two secondary hydroxyl groups functional groups are attached to these hydroxyl groups 19 the types of cellulose adsorbents have been synthesized to adsorb certain metals such as cellulose g acrylamide hg ii cellulose orange peel citric acid cd ii cellulose g acrylic acid acrylamide cu ii carboxylated polyacrylamide grafted banana stalk pb ii and cd ii 19 cellulose biopolymer is also used to preserve fruits and vegetables because of antioxidants and antibacterial properties in the study of liu and co workers the application of cellulose biopolymer in the food industry has been studied in detail 60 biological adsorption using base biopolymer has attracted a lot of attention the advantages of biological adsorption are low cost high selectivity short time performance easy degradability and availability additionally the solid benefit of biopolymers is that they are sustainable and harmless to the ecosystem for marine frameworks disadvantages include sensitivity to environmental changes by chemically modifying biological adsorbents and combining them with a specific functional group it is possible to achieve the adsorption of metal ions for example by bonding methacrylic acid to titanium dioxide cellulose in the presence of methylenebisacrylamide high adsorption can be achieved for some heavy metals 61 2 2 synthetic polymer adsorbents today various synthetic polymers have been developed in various forms for the base of polymer adsorbents synthetic polymers include polypropylene polyethylene polyethylene terephthalate polyamide polyurethane polytetrafluoroethylene in various forms of nonwoven fabric films fibers hydrogels resins and membranes different monomers are used to modify substrates such as acrylonitrile acrylic acid iminodiacetic acid methacrylic acid glycidyl metaacrylate gma pyrazole derivatives they are very suitable for effluent solutions also increasing the concentration of sulfuric acid is very effective as an additive for the bonding solution various monomers bond with synthetic polymers to remove heavy metals are mentioned in the below section for example a study on grafting copolymerization showed that different mixtures of monomers including acrylonitrile acrylic acid acrylonitrile methacrylic acid acrylonitrile methacrylate glycidyl are suitable for adsorption polymerization 62 okamatoniz and co workers illustrated that poly tfe e tetra fluororthylene co ethylene polypropylene and polyamide showed the highest bond strength 62 in another study pe pp films with a combination of acrylamide and acrylic acid monomers and carboxylic acid and pyridine agents by radiation bonding were studied good results are obtained for removing heavy metal 63 different methods have a unique role in graft polymerization and the creation of suitable polymers the comparison of methods is given in table 3 the following section shows that the reaction design of different co monomers and monomers are attached to various substrates by radiation grafting and are suitable options for the adsorption of heavy metals these adsorbents have been developed in multiple forms of hydrogels resins and particle fibrous fabrics films and membranes 2 2 1 hydrogel adsorbents hydrogels are three dimensional polymer networks with cross over joints that can adsorb a lot of water or biofluids even under pressure these compounds can adsorb large amounts of water without dissolving hydrogels are networked chemically or physically increasing attention is being paid to physiogenic hydrogels because of the overall simplicity of the interaction and the absence of a grid in their synthesis while its substance variations are of interest because of their brilliant mechanical strength in the past few decades hydrogels due to their extraordinary properties in different industries like food packaging drugs agriculture biomedical and bioengineering applications and in the assembling of specialized and electronic devices just as adsorbents for the evacuation of toxins in environmental applications are utilized 64 65 hydrogels are candidates for removing metal ions due to their hydrophilic properties and high swelling ratio however hydrogels have poor mechanical properties in the swelling equilibrium and have a slow reaction time hydrogels with new structures such as comb type hydrogels have fast reaction time and remarkable mechanical properties if these hydrogels are bonded on a polymer matrix such as polyethylene or polypropylene they can be reused and faster than hydrogel reactions 66 radiation induced polymer adsorbents in the form of hydrogels are formed using two methods of radiation induced polymerization and radiation induced crosslinking hydrogel adsorbents are less commonly used as adsorbents for wastewater treatment disadvantages of hydrogels include their poor mechanical strength and low selectivity the high water swelling in them has made them unsuitable as an adsorbent in adsorption columns polymer adsorbents in the form of hydrogels are divided into two categories hydrogel adsorbents based on natural and synthetic polymers natural polymer based hydrogel adsorbents are a type of biosorbent such as cmc gelatin sa carrageenan starch 67 these adsorbents can be synthesized by combining polymers or combining polymers with minerals or combining natural polymers with copolymers of different monomers such as aac aam sss maa amps hema 68 73 for example shawky and co workers grafted aac monomers to k carrageenan by gamma radiation synthesized adsorbents were tested for adsorption of various heavy metals 74 in another study cmc sss hydrogels were synthesized by radiation bonding and tested for adsorption 70 mahmoud and co workers investigated the grafting of paac to cs polymer via gamma ray crosslinking then tio2 nanoparticles are loaded on it the synthesized adsorbent was examined to remove the dye the results showed that the loading of tio2 nanoparticles increased the adsorption capacity 75 the starch was grafted with amps and dmaema under polymerization conditions due to radiation grafting after chemical modification it was tested for adsorption of cobalt and phosphate hydrogels based on synthetic polymers are used to adsorb heavy metals and various materials due to their porous structure their advantage is the ease of construction in different shapes and sizes for example cheng and co workers synthesized amphiphilic gels based on dmaema it was then tested for cr vi uptake after modification with 1 bromoalkanes the results showed that the length of alkyl chains of modifiers affects the adsorption capacity the highest adsorption capacity was 210 5 mg g 76 chen and co workers prepared lipophilic polyelectrolyte gels based on modat and dodecyl acrylate by the polymerization and crosslinking due to radiation grafting lipophilic polyelectrolyte gels can adsorb large amounts of organic solvents with a dielectric constant of less than 20 these gels are capable of high adsorption over a wide range of temperatures 77 2 2 2 granular and resins polymer adsorbents granular and resins polymer adsorbents can be used on a commercial scale due to their large surface area uniform particles and good mechanical strength in these adsorbents polymer particles and resins can be used as a substrate for polymer adsorbents then specific monomers grafted to them by radiation grafting finally after modification with unique functional groups to be used to adsorb heavy metals and various materials the best adsorbent particles are hdpe and evoh particles due to their reasonable price availability high thermal and chemical stability for example du and co workers synthesized a granular polymer adsorbent by irradiating sodium sulfonate on evoh particles and evaluated it as an nh4 adsorbent the maximum adsorption was 22 53 mg g 78 in another study gma was grafted to hdpe particles through radiation induced copolymerization and then modified by n methyl d glucamine to study b ii adsorption the maximum adsorption was 15 63 mg g 79 these adsorbents are often considered on exchange adsorbents in most cases the term refers to separation and disinfection of aqueous solutions and other ion containing solutions with a solid polymer or ion exchange mineral ion exchange methods are based on the reversible exchange of ions between a solution and a solid phase the solid phase is insoluble in water and has groups in the form of acidic or alkaline bases these foundations are the main factors in ion exchange ion exchange resins are of organic origin and are composed of high molecular weight polymers 80 increased graft polymerization alters the properties of the resin in terms of dewatering and ion penetration ion exchangers include two groups of anions and cations ion exchange resins are insoluble polymer matrices these resins contain unstable ions which perform the ion exchange action weak cationic resin can only adsorb alkali cations in water it cannot be used if it requires the adsorption of anions in water a strong anionic resin must be used to adsorb all the anions in the water one of the important advantages of weak anionic resin compared to its strong type is its high resistance therefore in weak water treatment systems the weak anionic resin is more beneficial 81 one of the functional groups considered for anion exchange adsorbents is amin nh2 quaternary phosphonium pr3 quaternary ammonium nr3 tertiary ammonium nr3 cation converters include the rcooh or r so3h groups 2 2 3 fabrics or fibrous adsorbents fibrous fiber sum is a material with flexible and delicate properties it has a longer length than its diameter length ratio to the diameter of the fiber must be more than 1000 to call it fiber fibers are physically short and fragmented or long and one sided they are divided into natural and artificial categories cellulose fibers are one of the most important natural fibers synthetic fibers are called synthetic because they are manufactured today hundreds of types of synthetic fibers are produced around the world by making a slight change in the fabric s nanometer dimensions the arrangement of polymer chains both in natural and synthetic fibers usually creates crystalline or non crystalline and so called amorphous regions the most important properties of fibers are related to the behavior of fibers in tensile and the amount of increase in their length and their behavior against bending properties mechanical fibers these properties are so crucial in many cases and they determine the use of fibers the fibers are always made of polymers that are crystallized the polymers used in the fibers must assemble in a regular arrangement to line up like fibers they can be considered a type of crystal that is very long 82 one of the advantages of fiber adsorbents over granular adsorbents is the ease of recycling on the other hand fiber adsorbents have flexibility low pressure drop and short passage distance to improve the fibers create new properties on the fibers and use them as adsorbents the polymerization technology is used due to radiation grafting of monomers to the surface of the fibers and modifying them with special functional groups fiber adsorbents due to radiation grafting are much more commonly used than particle shaped adsorbents on an industrial scale and in the fixed bed column adsorption experiments 83 the fibers used in fiber adsorbents due to radiation bonding are high molecular weight polyethylene fibers uhmwpe cotton lining pe pp nonwoven fabric and nylon fibers due to their relatively stable surface the long half life strong mechanical properties and corrosion resistance uhmwpe is a suitable substrate for polymer adsorbents due to radiation grafting guven and co workers grafted dmaema monomers on pe pp nwf fibers by polymerization due to radiation grafting they were then modified with dimethyl sulfate and performed adsorption tests to remove phosphate ions for 25 ppm of phosphate the adsorption capacity was 63 mg g and for 1000 ppm the adsorption capacity was 512 mg g 84 in another study dmaema monomers were grafted to pe pp fiber by direct irradiation the adsorption process was investigated for au iii the maximum adsorption capacity was 949 3 mg g 85 kavakli and co workers investigated the grafted vp 4 monomers to pe pp nwf by polymerization the maximum adsorption capacity for as v was reported at ph 7 equal to 98 04 mg g 86 in another study n vinyl 2 pyrrolidone monomers were grafted to pp pe nf by radiation induced graft polymerization by the pri irradiation method iodine uptake capacity was reported to be 1237 8 mg 38 du and co workers investigated the synthesized fibrous adsorbents by quaternary ammonium group gma monomers were grafted to the cotton lining fibers and modified with pentethylene hexamine using electron beams the synthesized adsorbent was examined for phosphate uptake at a concentration of 100 ppm the maximum adsorption capacity was reported to be 130 56 mg g 87 in another study acrylonitrile and acrylic acid monomers were grafted directly to uhmwpe fiber then using hydroxylamine they performed amidoximation to prepare the adsorbent the synthesized adsorbent by radiation grafting was tested to adsorb uranium from seawater the adsorption capacity was obtained equal to 4 54 g kg 88 2 2 4 membrane polymer adsorbents polymeric membrane attractions have become very popular due to their simplicity in design and ease of construction on a commercial scale where molecules are transported through interlayer channels 89 the membrane rejection mechanism is related to its polarity and the affinity between functional group interactions with contaminants 90 91 therefore the surface structures of the films must be modified to improve the membrane rejection capacity the major polymers used in the film industry include polyethylene polypropylene polyvinyl chloride polystyrene polyethylene terephthalate polyamide ethyl vinyl alcohol and polyvinyl chloride films made of different plastics have properties commensurate with the properties of the plastic used the essential features in choosing polymer films include water vapor and oxygen permeability strength and physical strain maximum application temperature cost process ability acceptability of functional groups for metal adsorption special functional groups should modify polymeric membranes according to the membrane type and applications of the adsorption type divided into three categories according to the characteristics of the functional groups anion exchange membrane cation exchange membrane and bipolar membrane the prepared membranes by radiation bonded polymerization are usually anion exchange 92 anion exchange membranes with positive groups and cation exchange membranes with negative groups are activated positive groups like nr3 nr2h nrh2 nh3 imidazole and groups like po3h so3 coo bipolar membranes include both anion and cation exchange groups different types of membranes and ion exchange films due to grafted polymerization are used to remove heavy metals 93 94 for example kim and co workers investigated the sss grafted poly ketone membrane through radiation induced graft polymerization the cation exchange membrane was examined for metal adsorption maximum adsorption was reached 87 95 in another study butyl methacrylate and aac were grafted on ldpe and ppe films it was shown that grafted films have high thermal stability and good hydrophilicity radiation grafted polymer adsorbents were tested for adsorption of copper cobalt and nickel the maximum adsorption was 977 4 mg g 714 3 mg g and 451 mg g respectively 96 in another study nipaam and aac were grafted using gamma radiation on polypropylene films by one step and two step methods the polymer film prepared by radiation grafted was tested for copper adsorption in an acidic environment the maximum adsorption reached 337 mg g 97 also glycidyl methacrylate monomers were bonded by irradiation to a pvdf membrane the grafting membrane was then modified with sodium sulfite polymeric membranes prepared by radiation grafting were tested for oil removal irradiation grafted polymer films have been shown to have good potential for oil removal from water 98 hamzah and co workers investigated the irradiated ptfe films with electron beams the irradiated film was then placed in a monomeric solution of acrylic acid the results showed that the hydrophilicity of the adsorbent obtained from the polymerization of the graft due to radiation was increased the grafted membranes were evaluated for adsorption of lead ions 99 3 methods of radiation grafting ionizing radiation is used to produce active radicals on the substrate that can be attached to various monomers therefore it produces monomeric polymer chains on the substrate surface there are different types of radiation alpha beta x rays gamma protons and neutron particles but the two types of radiation most used in this field are beta radiation and gamma radiation the charge and mass of the radiative particle depend on the state of the material density temperature and other factors of the target material the influence of rays on the properties and performance of each polymer is different which is due to their absolute and inherent sensitivity in the original structure of the polymer all materials in high radiation have a tolerance threshold above which the material will fail 100 the radiation induced graft polymerization is known as a modification technique of existing porous polymeric membranes the simple illustration between grafting performed by a gardener and a radiation chemist is shown in fig 2 cutting a branch and creating a graft on the tree by the gardener causes the fruits of the tree to grow optimally and the weather conditions and poor soil do not affect the fertility of the tree electron beams or gamma rays generate free radicals that can be bonded by carefully designing different monomers these functionalized bonds give a unique ability as a chemical adsorbent or catalyst for the structure limited polymer crosslinking in polymers by radiation bonding method is possible depending on the availability of radiation sources required production amount monomer reaction and sensitivity of the main body of the polymer to radiation and material conditions in two ways direct method and indirect method in both methods of beam bonding to obtain uniform bond efficiency it is essential to achieve the optimal combinations of reaction parameters which fall into two classes parameters directly are related to the radiation source type of radiation source dose and dose rate also they are related to the bond mixture include the sort of polymer base sort of monomer sort of diluent solvent the concentration of monomer reaction time and temperature among the reaction parameters the diluent solvent plays a key role in influencing the access of the monomer to the bonding sites and the bonding mechanism including inception proliferation of the developing chain and end hence it dominantly affects the degree of entrance and consistency nasef and co workers reported for the first time an optimization study for transplant parameters and prediction of transplant performance in the radiation transplant method using the response surface method rsm the use of rsm is a valuable tool to achieve the desired link benefit which has minimized the number of tests and reduced the cost 101 radiation grafting is a simple and helpful way to modify the properties of synthetic and natural polymer layers this method offers immediate benefits to a person that is superior to the usual chemical method and is no primer additive guarantees high purity of the product without impurities and unwanted groups it is possible to radiate polymerization of any monomer in solid liquid gas form polymers sensitive to the thermal process of room temperature can be produced it is possible to disinfect the product for biomaterials simultaneously this process can be controlled by optimizing radiant parameters such as dose etc high polymer efficiency is possible in bonded polymerization ability to combine two incompatible substances do not cause problems in the direction of the specific form of the adsorbent radiation grafting can be classified into five classes based on the type of intermediate 101 1 solvent mediated grafting in a solvent coupled copolymer bond polar and non polar solvents such as dilchromethane and toluene are added to the bonding mixture to enhance and facilitate monomer diffusion into the polymer this method is used in most rigp methods 2 emulsion mediated grafting in this method the monomer is added to the polymer after dilution with water and a small amount of surfactant such as tween this method offers significant advantages in reducing the radiation dose and consuming less monomer so it is economical 3 atomic transfer radical polymerization atrp mediated grafting an atrp catalyst agent enables the monomer to initiate a growing polymer chain and can withstand large amounts of impurities 4 reversible addition fragmentation chain transfer raft mediated grafting 5 nitroxide mediated grafting nitroxide is added to the monomer to stabilize the active radicals by a new reversible radical compound with nitroxide function it increases the balance between the radical growth of the chain and the end radicals coated with the nitroxide molecule 102 3 1 direct irradiation method in this method the monomer and the substrate are irradiated simultaneously one of the advantages of this method is that it has a grafting stage and can lead to a higher degree of grafting dog however this method can lead to large amounts of homopolymers and chemical wastes it is controlled by adding inhibitors or applying lower radiation dose rates however since mohr s salt reduces grafting efficiency an alternative method can be used to use styrene in a monomeric solution in this method the concentration of monomers m is much higher than the concentration of radicals on the substrate s as a result the radical concentration in the monomeric solution m is greater than s therefore based on the following reactions as shown in eqs 1 to 3 the probability of a reaction between m and m is much higher than that of a reaction with other species 1 m m m2 2 m m m2 3 m s m s in this method to increase the number of radicals formed in the bed compared to the inside of the monomeric solution higher temperature allows more diffusion of radical monomers and more growth of monomer chains with the radicals of the bed surface of course it can damage the reaction 103 3 2 indirect irradiation method in this method the substrate is irradiated in an inert atmosphere or vacuum or air after irradiation a monomeric solution is added to the substrate to allow the formed radicals in the substrate to react with the monomers this method reduces the rate of hemopolymerization compared to the direct irradiation method it has been shown that this technique produces less chemical waste and requires less primary monomer in addition grafted substrates are easier to wash to remove homopolymers and excess monomers in contrast the method is more complex in this method to protect more free radicals it is necessary to irradiate the bed at a low temperature before being placed in the monomeric solution the concentration of radicals in this system is not as high as the concentration of radicals in indirect irradiation also in this method the degree of grafting is lower 3 3 radiation grafting on polymers in different atmospheres 3 3 1 radiation under atmosphere when the polymer is irradiated under normal atmospheric conditions the presence of oxygen in the solution or around the sample during irradiation can disrupt the test oxygen is a highly reactive molecule that interacts with radicals formed on the surface of a polymer or monomer to form peroxide radicals leading to the suppression of radicals in some cases can be used for radiation grafting in a system containing polymer r oxygen reactions may occur that indicate the quenching of polymer radicals that can be used to continue the polymerization process 4 r o 2 r o 2 other reactions that may occur in this regard are as follows 5 r o 2 r h ro 2 h r 6 r o 2 r o 2 roor o 2 3 3 2 radiation under nitrous oxide during irradiation of an aqueous solution aqueous electrons and hydroxyl radicals are produced in the solution hydroxyl radicals play an important role in generating radical sites on the polymer column of a substrate for polymerization of bonded radiation to initiate the reaction by decomposing hydrogen from the polymer column or reacting with carbon carbon double bonds to initiate polymerization as a result the high concentration of hydroxyl in the solution during irradiation favour the final dog of the system and create many places for polymerization injection of nitrous oxide into the sample glass before irradiation allows the aqueous electrons to be converted to nitrogen gas and hydroxyl radicals by the following equation 7 e aq n 2 o n 2 o h 2 o n 2 oh oh the reaction between aqueous electrons and nitrous oxide is very fast thus allowing most aqueous electrons to be converted to hydroxyl radicals before they have a chance to react with other molecules in the aqueous system 3 3 3 radiation under inert atmosphere when irradiated under an inert atmosphere the presence of oxygen during irradiation can be ignored so interactions with different materials occur when using a non aqueous solution radiation under an inert atmosphere is beneficial for direct and indirect irradiation oxygen removal from an indirect irradiation system also allows radicals created on the fabric s surface to remain on the fabric until a monomeric solution is added to the vial it allows for a higher percentage of radicals generated to form bonded copolymers on the fabric surface increasing the final dog of the system for a direct bonding system using a non aqueous solution an inert atmosphere will limit the interaction of the radicals with other layers of the fabric 4 review of irradiated adsorbent studies many monomers have been studied in irradiation induced graft polymerization as shown in fig 3 and the primary reaction schemes of monomers for the preparation of adsorbents are shown in fig 4 in the following several studies for the removal of heavy metals including the parameters of irradiation method dose amount type of monomer and functional group adsorption amount and operating conditions of the adsorption process are described in table 4 4 1 adsorbent surface properties after preparing the adsorbents the characteristics of the adsorbent surface in terms of roughness contact surface angle and hydrophilicity and hydrophobic properties are analyzed by sem edx afm and other tests 104 for several decades modification of adsorbent surfaces has been considered to increase hydrophilic properties and increase adsorption for example shaimaa and co workers examined the adsorbent surface through sem after preparing environmentally friendly adsorbents the resulting analysis showed nodular protrusions on the synthesized adsorbent surface nzvi which was improved by silt clay modification sc nzvi to improve the physical properties of the surface 105 the contact angle test is generally used to show the hydrophilicity of the adsorbent surface membrane and fibers the smaller contact angle shows the more hydrophilic properties in the adsorbent according to studies by wenzel and co workers increasing the surface roughness enhances its wettability 106 in other words increasing the roughness of the hydrophilic surface always makes it hydrophilic while increasing the roughness of the hydrophobic surface leads to its hydrophobicity according to studies by wenzel et al in studies on polymer adsorbents due to the grafting of the radiation the grafting of monomers to the polymer surface often increases the surface roughness of the adsorbent it causes more hydrophobic on the other hand the radiation polymerization process in radiation induced polymer adsorbents due to the type of grafted monomer and modification with functional groups often reduces the contact surface angle which studies by nasef and co workers and other researchers 107 109 as another example fatahiyah and co workers investigated the grafted poly hea to the polymer surface of pvdf by pre irradiation method after analyzing the grafted polymer surface they observed that the surface roughness has increased and also the contact surface angle has decreased which means that the hydrophilicity of the polymer has increased after analyzing the afm images which show dark depressed valleys or pores and bright nodules of the surface they found that the unmodified pvdf has more bright nodules during the darker valleys on grafted pvdf 110 these findings are consistent with studies by other researchers 107 111 113 on the other hand the characteristics of the adsorbent surface such as specific surface area polarity and surface porosity are influential factors in the adsorption process surface porosity and the presence of a large surface area per unit mass are essential for the adsorbent in order to prepare polymeric adsorbents different monomers are grafted to different substrates in different shapes and then the grafted polymers are modified by suitable materials to remove different materials a noteworthy point in radiation grafted polymer adsorbents is the degree of radiation it is related to the specific surface of the adsorbent and is a very important factor in increasing the adsorption rate for example xu and co workers investigated the grafted acrylonitrile and acrylic acid monomers to the pe pp polymer substrate by irradiation and then modified them with amidoxy groups the bet surface area of the pe pp and pe pp g paac co pan fibers arrived at 4 3 and 3 7 m2 g respectively it inferred that the pe pp fibers were relatively rough compared to the pe pp g paac co pan fibers contrasted to the bet surface area of the pe pp fibers that of the pe pp g paac co pao fibers arrived at 6 4 m2 g addressing an increment of 48 8 which suggested that expanding the particular surface region will facilitate the extraction 55 due to its particular surface area and a higher degree of grafting radiation grafted polymer nanofibers have received much attention in separation processes abbasi and co workers used an electrospinning process to fabricate a polymer nanofiber then bonded gma monomers to it irradiated it with radiation and finally modified the bonded polymer with amine groups bet analysis showed that with increasing the degree of grafting from 150 to 300 the total pore volume of the samples decreased from 0 009 to 0 006 cm3 g however it is worth noting that these very low values are related to intra fiber pores revealing an almost solid non porous structure of single fibers bet investigation showed that with expanding the degree of grafting from 150 to 300 the total pore volumes diminished from 0 009 to 0 006 cm3 g nonetheless it is significant that these extremely low qualities are identified with intra fiber pores uncovering a practically strong non permeable construction of single fibers 114 4 2 effect of synthesis parameters monomers play an essential role in the adsorption of heavy metals from solutions and the formation of specific functional groups in the adsorbent some monomers such as acrylic acid acrylamide maleic acid and demylaminomethyl methacrylate tend to hemopolymerize during the irradiation process due to their chemical properties since the amount of homopolymer formed in the direct irradiation method is much higher using the indirect irradiation method is better when using these monomers on the other hand with increasing the concentration of monomer more grafting takes place however by increasing the monomer concentration too much the homopolymerization process competes with the polymerization process and reduces the graft performance 115 solvents are often used to dissolve monomers and increase monomer access to bond sites various studies have constantly shown that each particular solvent results in better graft performance for example for acrylic acid monomer water is the most suitable solvent 116 117 also in various studies tween 20 surfactant with water as an emulsion for gma monomer and dmf solvents for an monomer and dioxan solvent has been used for an aac monomers 118 120 the surface irradiation of this polymer has been investigated with various monomers the results of studies are reported in table 5 to extract uranium ions from an aqueous solution and seawater various dose rates are used in the radiation induced graft polymerization process the different dose rates have a significant impact on the properties of adsorbents with the increase in the dose rate the amounts of radical on the surface and the degree of grafting increase in the preparation procedure these conditions are not known as favorable conditions for the adsorption of heavy metals because the adsorption process of heavy metals is mainly done with a polymer adsorbent surface and increasing the bonding degrees in the adsorbent pores does not always help increase the adsorption capacity a comparison of different adsorbents in terms of gamma ray or electron beam dose is shown in table 6 the constituent elements in the polymeric substrate are closely related to the raw materials used for its preparation the proportions of polypropylene polyethylene and other polymeric materials affect the elemental composition of radiated induced graft adsorbents tables 7 and 8 list the differences in the elements contained in adsorbent made from various polymeric materials for uranium and thorium adsorption from aqueous solution mesoporous adsorbents such as sba 15 mcm 41 mcm 48 have a higher surface area and high porosity than polymer adsorbents due to radiation 121 122 however transfer limitations due to pore blockage can significantly reduce the surface area on the other hand the method of preparing these attractions is much more difficult titanium hydrogen oxide as a mesoporous adsorbent has lower strength and lower adsorption capacity than synthetic polymer adsorbents although it is difficult to compare the adsorption capacity between hydrogen titanium oxide and polymer adsorbents due to different test conditions it is observed that the adsorption capacity of these adsorbents is in the range of 0 025 to 1 2 for uranium adsorption 123 125 therefore the radiation grafting polymer adsorbents are more appropriate for uranium uptake as shown in table 7 different methods characterize the synthesized adsorbents each technique can provide significant answers in determining the essential adsorbent parameters and the effects of monomers and the radiation grafting polymerization the most important analysis methods are summarized in fig 5 hegazy and el rehim synthesized membranes with anion and cation exchangers experiments were performed on radiation grafting copolymerization of anionic and cationic binary monomers in this adsorbent acrylic acid and vinyl pyridine monomers are grafted on low density polyethylene polymer substrates by radiation grafting the prepared grafting membrane was examined for the adsorption of heavy metals such as lead zinc iron and a mixture of metals for specific metal selectivity different adsorbent synthesis conditions such as the combined ratio of monomers monomer concentration solvent type and radiation dose effects were analyzed the maximum adsorption capacity of zinc and cobalt was 147 mg g and 116 mg g respectively 126 in another study gamma irradiation was used to graft acrylic acid and 2 hydroxyethyl methacrylate hema comonomers on a polyethylene substrate in the presence of inhibitory salts and methanol and water solvents grafting performance was optimized according to the ratio of monomers monomer concentration and radiation dose the optimum degree of grafting was 289 at a monomer concentration of 20 and a monomeric ratio of hema aac 90 10 and a radiation dose of 30 kgy the adsorption capacity of this adsorbent was 96 6 mg g in an acidic medium ph 5 with an initial concentration of 500 ppm 7 in the study of kavaklı p a and o güven graft n n dipropionitrile and acrylamide on polyethylene coated polypropylene nonwoven fabric by radiation grafting for adsorption of uranium lead copper and cobalt at high concentrations was examined with batch experiments adsorption studies of metal ions with different initial concentrations 100 1500 ppm were performed the studies showed that the interaction between metal ions and amidoximized groups is in good agreement with the langmuir isotherm the amount of metal adsorption for the adsorbent was cu2 co2 uo2 2 pb2 127 in the study of kumar and co workers acrylonitrile monomers were grafted on a polypropylene substrate by grafting irradiation under an electron beam with an energy of 2 mev it was then chemically modified with hydroxylamine in this study the effect of different experimental variables such as radiation dose rate temperature and solvent composition was investigated polypropylene grafted with amidoxime group amo g pp was investigated for adsorption of heavy metal ions such as manganese cobalt nickel and cadmium the adsorption results were obtained as mn2 ni2 co2 cd2 the results showed that the equilibrium adsorption capacity of adsorbents in solutions containing metal ions 128 the pe g pssa adsorbent was investigated by simultaneous irradiation of styrene divinylbenzene onto low density polyethylene film followed by sulfonation to adsorb cobalt copper nickel lead and silver based on batch processes the influence of various parameters such as contact time initial metal ion concentration ph and solution temperature on membrane adsorption capacity was investigated this study showed that the percentage of metal ions adsorption strongly depends on the initial concentration of metal ions and ph the adsorption of metal ions mentioned in this adsorbent is independent of the temperature of the solution the maximum adsorption capacity of metal ions was obtained ag2 pb2 cu2 co2 ni2 129 the removal of cobalt nickel metal ions was investigated by adsorbents poly 1 vinyl 2 pyrrolidone co sodium acrylate they were synthesized by radiation grafting by gamma rays the effect of comonomer composition ratio their concentration and radiation dose on metal adsorption was investigated in addition the effect of adsorption conditions such as contact time ph and initial ion solution concentration on the metal ion binding capacity to the adsorbent was studied the maximum adsorption values for cobalt copper and nickel were 450 81 mg g 425 60 mg g 93 01 mg g respectively 130 przybytniak and co workers were studied the grafted acrylic acid and acrylamide monomers on a polypropylene filter by gamma rays at a dose of 10 kgy the aim of this study was the role of selected monomers in the adsorption of europium the carboxyl groups in the adsorbent increase the hydrophobicity of the polymer polypropylene matrix and increase the affinity for cation adsorption different synthesis and adsorption conditions were investigated in this study it seems that the bonded inner layers do not play an influential role in adsorption and the functional groups on the outer surface of the adsorbent play an essential role in the adsorption of metal ions 131 in the study of kumar and co workers gma monomers were deposited on nonwoven fibers by electron beam induced radiation grafting at a dose of 30 kgy then using different amines the chemical modification was performed and studied for copper adsorption fig 6 shows the structure of corrective adsorbents with different amines the amines used in this study are ethylene diamine eda diethylene acetaminophen deta triethylene tetramine teta tetraethylene pentamine tepa in which case modification with ethylene diamine is the best result for metal adsorption as a result maximum equilibrium adsorption was obtained equal to 50 mg g 12 the synthesis of a new adsorbent for cesium removal from the pollution water is shown in fig 7 it is observed that the new selective adsorbent by introducing ammonium 12 molybdophosphate onto pp nonwoven fabric with rigp method 132 5 continuous condition for adsorption adsorption processes are usually performed into continuous moving bed continuous fixed bed continuous fluidized bed on an industrial scale a fixed bed column is preferable for adsorption processes fixed bed columns are used in most separation processes based on adsorption to remove contaminants or treat wastewater 133 the schematic of the adsorption process in the fixed bed column is shown in fig 8 in these columns the inlet feed enters the column environment and the adsorbent quickly begins to adsorb the surface by the top layers of fresh adsorbent the mass transfer zone mtz is initially located near the top 134 most of the mass transfer takes place in this area in this region mass transfer from the fluid to solid the desired adsorbent occurs at the upper edge of this region the concentration of adsorbate is equal to the initial concentration of the inlet while at the lower edge of this region the concentration of adsorbate in the fluid phase is zero when the lower edge of this region reaches the end of the adsorbent the concentration of adsorbate increases rapidly in the fluid leaving the adsorbent this time is called breakthrough time the mass transfer zone proceeds at a different velocity from the fluid velocity along the column the mass transfer region extends to the column until c c 0 1 the mass transfer region is calculated with the relation zm z 1 tb te in this equation zm and z are the mass transfer zone s height and the bed s height respectively 135 by measuring the concentration of adsorbate in the outlet of the column and plotting this concentration over time a curve called the breakthrough curve is obtained 136 137 the shape of this curve is usually s in shape with different degrees of sharpness by examining this curve the efficiency of the column is obtained the important parameters in the performance of a column are the initial concentration of the adsorbate the flow rate of the adsorbate in the column the height of the column the ph of the adsorbate and the size of the adsorbent particles 134 also different mathematical models such as thomas model 138 adam bohart model and yoon nelson model are used to study the column performance the different mathematical models for the description of the continuous adsorption experiments is described in table 9 the initial concentration parameter of the adsorbate material is one of the most important parameters in the design of fixed bed column systems it can be said that with an increasing initial concentration of adsorbate exhaustion and breakpoints occur earlier this phenomenon is because at the beginning of adsorption due to the presence of many empty sites in the bed adsorption occurs rapidly increasing the initial concentration leads to more driving force this driving force destroys the resistance to mass transfer from the liquid phase to the adsorbent so the sites evacuate quickly here the driving force is the concentration difference between the fluid and the adsorbent the more diluted solution showed less driving force and lower adsorption capacity so in solutions with higher concentrations the slope of the breakthrough curve is greater and the exhaustion and breakpoints occur in a shorter time 139 regarding the adsorbent height parameter it should be said that the exhaustion and break times occur later with increasing height and also the volume of treated effluent increases with increasing bed depth the reason for this is that as the bed height increases the area of the bond area and the number of empty sites for adsorption increases and also the time of interaction of the adsorbate material increases with increasing the amount of adsorbent 140 141 the flow rate parameter is one of the important parameters in the design of the fixed bed column which with the increase of the flow rate the breakpoint occurs faster the rate of mass transfer from the liquid phase to the solid phase increases with increasing flow rate the amount of adsorbed material per unit height of the bed mtz area increases which shortens the saturation time because at lower flow rates the adsorbate has more time to contact the adsorbent which eliminates more adsorbate in the column 142 144 the solution ph parameter is also very important in column design some contaminants are adsorbed more at acidic ph and some have the highest adsorption at alkaline ph this parameter depends on the type of adsorbent and the nature of the adsorbate 145 ting and co workers investigated boron removal from real industrial wastewater containing high concentrations of ammonia using a fibrous adsorbent containing glucamine groups the adsorbent was prepared from the glycidyl methacrylate gma emulsion radiation grafting on nylon 6 fibers and then treated with n methyl d glucamine nmdg the adsorbent performance obtained for boron adsorption was tested at different flow rates using a fixed bed column the data obtained from the fixed bed column were analyzed using three common mathematical models such as yoon nelson thomas and modified dose response mdr models the results of breakthrough curves are better suited to the mdr model the synthesized adsorbent showed the necessary stability after five adsorption desorption cycles according to the results it was observed that this adsorbent has the necessary ability to remove boron 146 dong and co workers studied combining the advantages of cellulose and ionic liquid the ionic liquid functionalized cellulose ilfc as a radiation grafting adsorbent in this study glycidyl methacrylate was grafted onto cellulose microsphere by radiation the reaction was then performed with ionic liquid 1 aminopropyl 3 methyl imidazolium nitrate and the adsorbent was prepared the properties of this adsorbent in cr vi adsorption were investigated by batch and columnar experiments in batch experiments the adsorption kinetics were fitted with a pseudo second order mode with equilibrium time of 2 h and ph 2 the adsorption capacity reached 181 8 mg g in the fixed bed column both yoon nelson and thomas models were consistent with the experimental data and breakthrough curves also in the column experiments the equilibrium adsorption capacity calculated by the thomas model was 161 mg g this adsorbent also showed high selectivity to cr vi adsorption desorption tests also showed that the adsorbent was used several times without reducing its adsorption capacity 147 a comparative study investigated the selective removal of boron from aqueous solutions on a fibrous adsorbent and diaion crb03 granular resin in a fixed bed column the fibrous adsorbent was prepared by binding vinylbenzyl chloride vbc on nylon 6 fibers and then treated with n methyl d glucamine nmdg the effect of changes in space velocities sv on breakthrough curves was investigated it was observed that the mdr model was in good agreement with the experimental adsorption data of both adsorbents the fibrous adsorbent had a higher adsorption capacity than the resin grains in all space velocities sv the adsorbed boron was washed using 0 1 m hcl and the reduced adsorbent remained constant after ten adsorption desorption cycles the author and his colleagues observed that the fibrous adsorbent prepared in this experiment performed better than diaion crb03 granular resin indicating the high capacity of this adsorbent to remove boron from aqueous solutions in the laboratory and industrial rolls 148 vijayasri and co workers studied chitosan a natural biopolymer to remove arsenic from groundwater chitosan was modified with 2 hydroxyethylmethacrylate hema and sodium styrene sulfonate sss the maximum removal percentage of as v occurred at an input concentration of 60 mg l at 1 ml min rate and ph 3 5 and a bed depth of 3 cm the bonded adsorbent used in the fixed bed column was reduced with 0 1 m naoh and the adsorbent remained stable for up to 8 adsorption desorption cycles 149 lopez and co workers studied metal ion adsorbents which have amino and iminodiacetic groups produced by glycidyl methacrylate gma beam grafting on polypropylene non woven fabric synthesis was performed by the reaction of epoxide functional groups with ethylenediamine or iminodiacetic acid based on the results of batch and column adsorption experiments amino and iminodiacetic adsorbents performed well to remove cr vi and cd ii respectively the amino adsorbent was reduced with 2 m naoh solution and the iminodiacetic type adsorbent was reduced by organic acids such as citric acetic and oxalic acids it was observed that both adsorbents had more than 94 adsorption efficiency the adsorbents remained stable in five consecutive adsorption desorption cycles breakthrough curves were plotted in different streams of feed the amino type adsorbent packed in the column can purify 1500 ml of 3 ppm cr vi solution finally it was observed that the amino type adsorbent was successfully used in the actual wastewater treatment and the effluents obtained were by national standards 150 sarala and co workers examined the performance of an adsorbent in a fixed bed column this adsorbent was obtained by glycidyl methacrylate gma grafting by electron beam irradiation on banana fibers the obtained adsorbent was used to adsorb acid blue 80 ab80 the influence of flow rate bed height and inlet concentration was analyzed this experiment showed that increasing the bed height and inlet concentration increase the efficiency of the adsorbent the maximum adsorption capacity was obtained for a bed with a 5 ml min flow rate and an input concentration of 100 mg l and a height of 50 mm 45 19 mg g it was observed that the thomas model had the closest result to the behavior of breakthrough curves 151 6 future perspectives the market needs to commercialize are the most important part of achieving a targeted product a schematic of the transfer procedure from the market to commercial stage for synthetic adsorbents is shown in fig 9 of course the irradiation process the increase in costs the advantages of grafting the specific driving force to achieve the goal are fundamental in selecting a suitable adsorbent uranium uptake was studied in 1984 in japan by the method of grafting irradiation in this method acrylonitrile adsorbents were grafted to the polyethylene fibers under irradiation and the surface was treated with amiodioxime groups economic evaluation of adsorbent production with the aim of adsorbing 2 g of uranium per kilogram of adsorbent repetition period equal to 6 times and adsorption time in the range of 60 days and 360 days for operations were considered the evaluation results are shown in figs 10 and 11 according to the figures 82 of the costs are for the supply of pe polymers and used chemicals therefore high prices are required in the process of synthesis of adsorbent and its production on the other hand the adsorbent can only be recycled in six steps and it is necessary to provide an incinerator to eliminate it which is associated with environmental pollution the type of used solvent such as dimethylformamide also increases the number of environmental pollutants therefore the challenge of producing an adsorbent by reducing costs and reducing the load of environmental pollutants is still in the path of research and development therefore low cost and high efficiency for heavy metals are exceptional characteristics that make rigp polymers attractive adsorbents with increased demand for the preparation of various functional monomers the new approaches aim to understand better the mechanisms of the interaction between heavy metals and the adsorbents and in line with the above and environmental applications to develop new monomers that allow an increase in the selectivity parameter to remove heavy metal ions from wastewater 7 conclusion the discharge of wastewater including heavy metals from many different industrial processes to the environment has been on the rise the removal of them from wastewater has been developed using various techniques a detailed review of severing the radiation induced grafted polymerization adsorbents is discussed in this paper which reveals an excellent potential for the separation of heavy metal ions from aqueous solutions the radiation induced graft polymerization has revolutionized polymeric adsorbents due to the presence of monomers ligands extractants on the surface of polymers with the creation of large surface area and low mass transfer resistance radiation induced grafting polymerization is performed by both direct and indirect methods in the direct method the polymer substrate is irradiated simultaneously in the monomeric solution and in the indirect method the polymer substrate is irradiated first then placed in the monomeric solution a relatively large amount of homopolymer is formed in the indirect procedure indirect techniques can store the radicals produced by electron beam or gamma ray this procedure is effective for the mass production of polymeric adsorbents because the irradiation process and grafting process are separable an appropriate choice of the form of a polymeric adsorbent contributes to an increment in the overall adsorption rate gamma ray is the most abundant economic source for the synthesis which usually uses the lower values for the dose rate the review also suggested that the adsorption capacity of polymeric adsorbent improved with increasing the grafting percentage the production of polymeric adsorbents with high selectivity and adsorption efficiency at a low cost is still a significant challenge environmental effects are reduced and increased by the use of unconventional solvents and the burning of the spent adsorbents this challenge can be reduced only by properly considering environmentally friendly solvents

13277,we evaluated the impact of feeding strategy on the performance and operational stability of aerobic granular sludge ags treating high strength ammonium concentrations synthetic wastewater with characteristics close to those found in sanitary landfill leachate was applied in sequential batch reactors sbr for biomass cultivation in this sense differing only in the feeding method three identical 7 6 l working volume reactors were operated with the same total cycle time of 12 h duration in r1 and r2 it was adopted feeding in the anaerobic period with a duration of 20 min fast and 40 min slow respectively in r3 feeding was distributed throughout the cycle step feeding half of which was introduced initially and the other half divided equally with 40 and 60 of the cycle substrate distribution throughout the cycle r3 minimized three of the biggest problems faced when treating leachate in ags systems granules stability biomass retention and nitrite accumulation besides compared to fast r1 and slow r3 feeding this mode of operation obtained the best total phosphorus tp 53 and total nitrogen tn 92 removals without any nitrite or nitrate accumulations cod removals were very similar in r2 and r3 but tn and tp removals were significantly greater in r3 therefore the feeding method directly interferes with the performance granules characteristics and system stability the results obtained in this research can be used in future works applying the ags technology for sanitary landfill leachate and other complex wastewaters treatment graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords aerobic granular sludge concentrated wastewaters leachate treatment step feeding 1 introduction leachate treatment from sanitary landfills has been carried out mainly by classic biological processes however landfill age ends up limiting the application of these processes due to toxicity by free ammonia fa and free nitrous acid fna in old landfills 10 years 1 2 this complex wastewater is characterized by high concentrations of total nitrogen tn especially ammonia recalcitrant organic matter and low biodegradability bod5 cod 0 1 heavy metals inorganic salts and xenobiotic organic compounds 3 5 new alternatives to conventional biological treatments have been sought to cover all landfills leachate characteristics and the aerobic granular sludge ags system technology has been considered promising especially for its capacity of carrying out almost all biological conversions in a single system i e organic matter nitrification denitrification and phosphorus removals 6 7 however operational strategies must be adopted to minimize the problems reported by several authors lee et al 39 lin et al 40 such as biomass instability long period of granule formation when using real sewage nitrite accumulation low phosphorus removal in some cases among others advances in the use of the ags technology for sanitary landfill leachate treatment are still incipient and include the pre treatment study and optimization of the aeration system 8 9 the comparison with activated sludge process regarding different raw leachate dilutions 2 5 10 and the co treatment with domestic sewage 3 10 therefore there are still many gaps to be filled especially concerning optimizing operational conditions for the formation and maintenance of aerobic granules the feeding mode is one of the key factors in the selection formation and stability of aerobic granules 11 12 the anaerobic filling in sequential batch reactors sbr has been widely accepted in which the duration and influent load are considered efficiency determining factors little studied but with great potential to favor granulation in effluents with high refractory loads such as sanitary landfill leachate step feeding can be an efficient strategy to remove organic matter and nitrogen simultaneously it is known that during biological nitrogen removal denitrification is usually the limiting step due to the lack of a proper carbon source in the leachate to support denitrification 3 5 consequently a high concentration of nitrite no2 or nitrate no3 can be found in the effluent reducing nitrogen removal efficiency in ags denitrification can occur in the anoxic zone of the granules or anoxic phases of the cycle however even before denitrification occurs the influent carbon has already been depleted therefore the substrate distributed throughout the sbr operating cycle can make good use of the influent organic matter as the carbon source allowing nitrification to occur with a lower organic load in the aerobic phase and favoring denitrification 13 14 to date the number of investigations applying the ags technology with step feeding is still limited chen et al 15 obtained tn removals of 93 for granules of 0 7 mm and 95 9 for granules of 1 5 mm without nitrite accumulations however wang et al 14 observed nitrite accumulation in the order of 93 5 reducing tn removal to 70 tn removals were greater than 90 and more significant in c n ratios of 5 1 than 3 1 13 zhong et al 16 achieved tn removals of 89 7 92 4 in step feeding mode and 48 1 59 5 in single feeding mode however all these investigations alternated anoxic phases with oxide phases and worked with low medium influent loads in this context the present research evaluated the feeding impact on the performance and operational stability of ags systems treating high strength ammonium concentrations for this three ags reactors were fed with synthetic effluent with characteristics similar to the leachate from a brazilian sanitary landfill each reactor had a different feeding strategy conventional fast conventional slow and step mainly aiming at increasing biomass retention minimizing nitrite accumulation and favoring phosphorous removal as far as we are concerned step feeding has not been previously investigated for leachate treatment in ags systems 2 material and methods 2 1 experimental set up the experiments were carried out in three identical sbrs inoculated with the same biomass and operated under the same conditions changing only the feeding method the reactors had 7 85 l with working volume of 7 6 l internal diameter of 10 cm height of 100 cm and height to diameter ratio h d of 10 with a 50 exchange volume the total experiment duration was 120 days for r1 and 134 days for r2 and r3 both divided into two periods by changing the sedimentation time ts in the first 40 days of operation the ts was 20 min period i being reduced to 10 min period ii until the experiment completion the reduction in ts favors biomass selection and increases efficiency and long term stability benefiting aerobic granulation 6 the duration of each cycle was 12 h which consisted of feeding 20 40 min aerobic reaction 659 679 min sedimentation 20 10 min and discharge 1 min in the aerobic phase the air was injected by porous fine bubble diffusers through the reactor bottom using an air compressor yuting sun china ensuring a dissolved oxygen do concentration between 2 and 5 mg l systems operation was automated using synchronized timers fig 1 the feeding differentiation in the reactors followed the description below r1 conventional feeding piston flow in anaerobic anoxic phase lasting 20 min fast r2 conventional feeding piston flow in anaerobic anoxic phase lasting 40 min slow r3 step feeding over the cycle in three moments with 50 of the influent volume being introduced at the beginning of the cycle and the other half divided equally with 40 and 60 of the cycle the reactors were operated at room temperature and the reaction temperature was around 28 2 c during the experiment there was no programmed sludge discharge resulting in different sludge retention times srts 2 2 sludge source and synthetic wastewater composition the reactors were inoculated with the same volume of flocculent aerobic sludge from an activated sludge plant treatment domestic sewage fortaleza ceará brazil a synthetic wastewater was used presenting the c n p ratio of 50 10 1 found in the raw leachate from the municipal sanitary landfill west of caucaia asmoc ceará brazil table 1 it is important to mention that heavy metals concentration in the sanitary landfill leachate is usually very low not causing toxicity to the biological treatment 3 10 furthermore heavy metals solubility is reduced due to the higher ph found in old leachate which allows metal precipitates formation along with sorption processes on the colloidal matter surface decreasing the leachate toxicity 17 18 thus the influent synthetic wastewater was composed of 1000 mg cod l of sodium acetate as a carbon source 200 mg l of nh4 n nh4cl as nitrogen source 20 mg l of po4 3 p from kh2po4 as a phosphorus source and 1 ml l of trace element solution as described by rollemberg et al 19 like the asmoc leachate and the ones investigated by ren et al 2 10 the ph was kept close to neutrality being adjusted with sodium bicarbonate 2 3 analytical methods system influent and effluent cod ph nh4 n no2 n no3 n po4 3 p mixed liquor suspended solids mlss mixed liquor volatile suspended solids mlvss and sludge volumetric index svi in 10 e 30 min svi10 and svi30 were analyzed two to three times a week and determined according to apha 41 dissolved oxygen do was measured by a ysi 5000 probe ysi incorporated usa total inorganic nitrogen tin was considered as the sum of nh4 n no2 n and no3 n 20 the content of eps extracellular polymeric substances was also quantified by the modified heat extraction method according to rollemberg et al 19 particle size was measured to determine the granulation process and granules stability using image pro plus software from microscopic images the reactor reaches the aerobic granulation stage only when more than 80 of the biomass had a diameter greater than 0 2 mm 21 the cycle tests were carried out at the end of the experiment period ii when the reactors reached complete stability to understand the sndpr mechanisms simultaneous nitrification denitrification and phosphorus removal concentrations of nh4 n no2 n and no3 n po4 3 p and do were determined as described by li et al 22 2 4 morphology of the granules the structure of the mature granules was analyzed by scanning electron microscopy sem combined with spectrum energy dispersive x rays inspect s50 fei company usa the pretreated consisted of fixing washing and lyophilization according to the methodology described by motteran et al 23 2 5 statistical methods statistical analyses were performed with the origin 2018 computer software using the mann whitney rank sum test to compare the reactor performance at a 95 confidence level the data groups were statistically different when p 0 05 3 results and discussion 3 1 start up formation and stabilization of the granules the three reactors were initially operated with the same sludge source presenting about 3 4 g l of mlss mlvss mlss ratio of 88 and svi30 of 190 ml g the evolution of these parameters throughout the experiment is shown in fig 2 after start up the mlss concentration gradually decreased in both r1 20 min feeding and r2 40 min feeding sedimentation time reduction was a key strategy for promoting granulation however even after biomass stabilization a constant sludge loss washout was observed in these reactors which is very common in ags systems operated with high load wastewaters 24 26 it may indicate the formation of a biomass with high growth of filamentous microorganisms at high rates of substrate transport making them more flocculent as the high influent organic load is not biodegradable there will be impacts on the carbon supply for denitrification which might also result in biomass washout 3 5 8 thus an external addition of soluble cod becomes necessary for ags cultivation when it is intended to treat effluents not favorable to slow growing bacteria development besides distributing the organic load throughout the cycle to reduce toxicity and favor denitrification seems to be an efficient strategy disintegration of the granules was frequent in r2 and mlss concentration was very unstable failing to achieve a consistent regranulation as previously reported for ags systems treating leachate from sanitary landfills granule disintegration also occurred after 50 days of operation and excessive biomass loss was found 3 10 these authors also pointed out that loads above 200 mg l nh3 n favored granules disintegration therefore it becomes evident that the influent cod n ratio is preponderant for the formation and maintenance of stable granules when this ratio is high there is a growth of filamentous microorganisms that can cause granule disintegration 27 28 on the other hand reducing this ratio generates great changes in the microbial community it decreases the eps content impacting nitrification and resistance size and sedimentation capacity of the granules and subsequent biomass loss thus the instability and disintegration of aerobic granules in high influent loads can be attributed to the increase in granule size due to the inability of carbon penetration to the hydrolysis and protein degradation of the granule nucleus and to the loss of microorganisms ability to self aggregate due to reduction of eps protein content 29 30 in r3 step feeding during period i sedimentation time of 20 min despite mlss concentration has increased the svi also increased which indicates a sludge of low sedimentability possibly dispersed or flocculent after reducing the sedimentation time this poor quality sludge was washed out after 30 days of stability there was again a biomass growth significantly improving sedimentability and reaching a mlss concentration similar to the inoculum therefore as in the experiments by wang et al 14 with two feeds throughout the cycle the mlss first decreased and then increased and stabilized these results are also in line with those of wei et al 9 treating leachate without dilution 3 2 g l mlss and bueno et al 3 with 5 leachate diluted in synthetic domestic sewage 3 3 g l mlss therefore r3 had greater solids retention 3 4 g l mlss followed by r2 2 1 g l mlss and r1 1 9 g l mlss also at the end of the operation mlvss proportion in relation to mlss was 90 in r3 88 in r1 and 67 in r2 retention of solids in ags reactors has been one of the difficulties encountered when treating leachate with controversial results and without a defined tendency wei et al 9 and bella and torregrossa 8 obtained a decrease in mlss concentration when they started with 4 and 11 g l mlss respectively and ended the experiments with 3 and 5 g l mlss ren et al 5 10 practically achieved twice the initial mlss concentration while ren et al 10 did not obtain any change apparently the only pattern found is that the higher the leachate concentration the greater the solids loss agreeing with some previous studies 2 3 wang et al 14 point out that the mlss maintenance is mainly linked to the inoculum quality as the high concentration of inoculum sludge causes stronger and more frequent collisions and friction among microorganisms resulting in the microbial self aggregation improvement other causes are high influent carbon and nitrogen loads system operation and dilution factors in terms of sedimentability in all reactors the first falls in the svis were due to the initial biomass washout however except r1 the svi improved a lot after the adaptation period reaching a good stability thus r3 had the best svi30 result 30 ml g while r1 had the worst result with svi30 greater than 120 ml g as in r1 the aeration phase was greater it was expected to present better sedimentability which did not occur however the svi30 was greater than 160 ml g during period i being improved with sedimentation time reduction period ii therefore to improve the sedimentability in r1 lower sedimentation time would be necessary to select the biomass better in addition between 60 and 70 days of operation the sludge from r2 and r3 reached svi30 60 ml g while in r1 it was above 100 ml g therefore the granulation process was better in r3 and r2 respectively since normally mature granules have svi30 between 30 and 80 ml g 31 even with higher carbon and nitrogen loads the results for r3 were similar to those that adopted the same feeding configuration svi30 30 ml g 13 14 and those that used dilutions that varied between 10 and 100 svi30 25 ml g 2 10 these results showed that compared with reactors with fast single feeding r1 and slow single feeding r2 the step feeding distributed throughout the cycle is an excellent strategy to retain biomass and improve sedimentability this configuration inhibits the excessive proliferation of fast growing heterotrophic bacteria through the succession of feast famine conditions it promotes the development of granules of good sedimentation with reinforced structure contributing greatly to the system stability 13 32 besides it has become evident that fast feeding imposes a strong selection pressure making biomass retention and granulation difficult as the cod is not readily oxidized in the anaerobic period and in the first hours of the aerobic reaction ordinary heterotrophic organisms oho begin to develop mainly in filaments being eliminated in the frequent washouts therefore if a large part of the cod is not oxidized at the beginning of the cycle problems with biomass may be more significant as the organic matter present in the leachate is recalcitrant and of low biodegradability a longer time is required for hydrolysis thus an anaerobic feeding with a longer duration favors granulation and studies with longer times than those used in this research are recommended in the case of step feeding the cod toxicity is minimized as it is distributed throughout the cycle favoring the development of beneficial microorganisms for the granulation without being eliminated since the washouts are much less frequent and biomass growth is greater than its loss 3 2 characteristics of the granules the aerobic granules showed some different physical and chemical characteristics table 2 therefore how the reactors were fed affected granules characteristics probably due to the different microbial groups that were favored with each strategy adopted in reactors r2 and r3 it can be seen that the values of svi5 svi10 and svi30 became lower with the sedimentation time decrease this result demonstrates that biomass sedimentability has improved over time being a typical evolution behavior from flocculent sludge to granular sludge the opposite occurred with r1 in which svi5 and svi10 increased with reduced sedimentation time indicating poor sedimentability and filamentous biomass several authors point out that the svi8 svi30 or svi5 svi30 ratios can be considered good predictors of granulation meaning that a value closer to 1 0 indicates that the sludge consists mainly of mature granules 19 33 34 for effluents with high loads they observed that there is a predominance of aerobic granules when this ratio is between 1 2 and 1 8 values above 1 8 characterize an ags thickening thus the results indicate that the granulation in r2 and r3 was better than in r1 whose svi5 svi30 ratio of 1 7 0 3 suggests biomass thickening in addition the higher the leachate proportion the closer to 1 0 will be the svi5 svi30 ratio 3 5 10 with this regard r3 was the best strategy to achieve such a profile the literature also reports that the reactor is considered granular when more than 80 of the biomass has a diameter greater than 0 2 mm 34 therefore the three reactors fit as aerobic granular systems since more than 80 of the granules are larger than 0 2 mm fig 3 in r3 more than 80 of the granules were not only larger than 0 2 mm but larger than 1 0 mm with an average diameter in period ii of 1 0 mm and 1 3 mm at the end of the experiment thus the average diameter of the granules in r3 after 134 days of operation was greater than those obtained in all existing ags studies so far on leachate treatment 0 36 0 60 mm 9 0 80 0 90 mm 8 0 31 mm 10 1 1 mm 5 0 21 0 48 mm 2 10 0 61 mm 3 however some granules with a diameter of 1 5 mm were observed furthermore they were also superior to the granules reported in the studies by wang et al 14 with feeding distributed in two stages of the cycle 1 1 mm and similar to those of chen et al 13 with alternating feeding in 3 times 1 3 mm furthermore as shown in fig 4 only r3 presented a granule with a more stable and uniform surface making it possible to verify the dominance of coccus over bacillus and filamentous bacteria r1 and r2 did not exactly present a uniform granular structure being observed a tangle of filaments however in r2 a more granular structure that tends to uniformity is verified despite not showing dominance of coccus concerning eps these substances are biopolymers consisting of polysaccharides proteins and other substances which play a fundamental role in the granules structure formation and stability in other words they act as a biological glue in which ps and pn are responsible respectively for granule aggregation and mechanical stabilization 6 as expected r1 had a higher total eps content which agrees with rusanowska et al 35 who reported that smaller granules have a higher amount of eps besides the longer aeration phase duration also influences the eps content confirming that eps production is stimulated by the stress caused by the aeration condition 6 however this high eps production in r1 did not result in a better sedimentation capacity of the granules the reported eps results for r2 and r3 were lower than r1 and similar to each other indicating a balance between eps production and consumption as is known eps production occurs mainly during the feast period and its consumption occurs during the famine period so it was expected that in step feeding eps production tended to balance being lower than in the other reactors since the operation produces successive periods of feast famine distributed throughout the cycle in most studies aerobic granules that are stable have a higher protein portion pn than polysaccharides ps being correlated to hydrophobicity therefore because pn promotes ags stability pn ps ratio is a way of characterizing its stability 6 thus the granules in r1 also showed better results pn ps 5 2 than those in r2 pn ps 4 9 and r3 pn ps 3 9 retention of solids has generated inconsistent results among the leachate studies it seems that eps production does not follow a trend as well for instance pn ps ratio was 4 8 9 while it did not exceed 0 6 in other studies 5 10 eps production is influenced by several factors such as aeration time cycle time shear stress reactor settings type of inoculum among others therefore the set of configurations adopted in this study favored eps production and the pn ps ratio possibly improving granules stability and structure 3 3 performance of the reactors during the granulation process the performance of the reactors was evaluated in terms of cod nitrogen and phosphorus table 3 in all reactors the cod removal was high but nitrogen and phosphorus removals had different behaviors and were better with the sedimentation time reduction the fast anaerobic feeding r1 showed total and soluble cod removals statistically different and lower than in r2 with slow anaerobic feeding p 0 001 and the one achieved in r3 with step feeding p 0 001 r3 showed a greater and significantly different total cod removal compared to r2 p 0 001 however there were no statistical differences between r2 and r3 regarding soluble cod removals p 0 604 which may once again emphasize that the constant washouts in r2 may have influenced the total effluent cod concentration regarding total nitrogen tn removal mean values above 50 were observed during the entire operation except r1 in period i and significant statistical differences between the three systems were found p 0 001 as the profile of nitrogenous fractions was different it is worth mentioning that the removal mechanisms were also different there was nitrite accumulation in r1 and r2 being significantly lower in r2 p 0 004 in r3 low nitrite and nitrate concentrations were observed resulting in higher tn removals 92 tn removals in r3 were superior to the values of 75 4 9 and 50 10 reported with real sanitary leachate during the two periods the nitrification process was observed in both r1 and r2 systems with values greater than 70 and increased when the sedimentation time was reduced however in period ii it was possible to verify significant differences between r1 and r2 p 0 001 and between r2 and r3 p 0 008 thus the largest removal of ammonia occurred in r3 99 followed by r2 98 and r1 97 as the mlvss concentration decreased r1 and r2 and remained unchanged r3 after system stability the demand for do did not increase since the aeration flow rate was kept unchanged during the operation nitrifying bacteria activity was not affected favoring nitrification efficiency in addition in r2 during granules disintegration and recurrent washouts ammonia removal was reduced although on some days ammonia removal was restored possibly due to the loss of nitrifying bacteria that were present in the broken granules when washouts occur at higher frequencies the sludge age is reduced and nitrification will be affected if the sludge age is too low according to rollemberg et al 6 several studies have shown that the sludge age is an important parameter for granules stabilization and reactors performance since it is directly related to the maintenance of slow growing bacteria it has been reported that the step feeding mode is effective for making good use of the influent carbon source increasing the denitrification rate and tn removal 15 thus nitrification occurs with a lower organic load in the aerobic phase accelerating the nitrification rate and saving do consumption to oxidize the influent organic matter this feeding mode benefits ammonia oxidizing bacteria aob growth and inhibits nitrate oxidizing bacteria nob accelerating nitrite accumulation 13 14 however in this study no accumulation of nitrite was observed it is important to note that in the later works in addition to the low influent loads the reaction phase was not totally aerobic interspersed with anaerobic anoxic phase which may have contributed to failures in the simultaneous nitrification and denitrification snd besides in r3 there was no solids loss favoring aob and nob maintenance in the system the larger granules of r3 may also have favored snd since this process occurs mainly in granules of larger size in which nitrification occurs in the outer layer and denitrification in the innermost layer anoxic as is known the proportion of denitrified nitrate in relation to the nitrate produced increases with the average granule diameter i e with a greater anoxic layer 19 concerning total phosphorus tp removals the three systems showed significantly different values p 0 001 and were practically unchanged by decreasing the sedimentation time as expected r1 had the lowest tp removals due to the rapid anaerobic feeding and the absence of anaerobic anoxic phases during the cycle r2 presented tp removals similar to traditional ags cycles for low load effluents and smaller than in r3 probably in r2 there may have been competition between phosphate accumulating organisms paos and denitrifying microorganisms in which denitrifying ones may have been favored another probable cause is the presence of glycogen accumulating organisms gaos which have a similar metabolism to paos but do not accumulate phosphorus besides substrate complexity must be considered which may not have favored phosphorus removals in both reactors the best tp removals were in r3 53 in which the three feast moments during the cycle favored the selection of paos it is important to mention that from the 20th to the 35th tp removals in r3 were greater than 80 however there was a reduction to stabilize then probably the bacteria saturated and the efficiency decreased requiring sludge age control zhu et al 36 demonstrated that aerobic granule deterioration occurred more easily in ags systems with high srt of granular sludge and an adequate selective sludge discharge favors process stability bassin et al 37 and rollemberg et al 6 also suggest controlled sludge removal bed or bottom to remove these saturated bacteria and improve phosphorus removal also tp removals in r3 were slightly higher than those by bueno et al 3 when treating higher leachate concentrations in both low and high leachate dilutions ren et al 2 did not obtain phosphorus removal being sometimes even reported negative values therefore it was found that the anaerobic feeding with a longer duration had the best tn and tp removals table 4 for cod removals feeding duration does not seem to interfere with efficiency however the influent load increase negatively impacts cod removal however the step feeding investigated in this work showed a higher cod removal efficiency than all previous studies except for 10 who used influent concentrations of phosphorus much lower than the current investigation tp removal through step feeding was also the highest observed regarding tn removal step feeding showed efficiency greater than 90 also being better than the values reported elsewhere likely because it provides carbon for denitrification to occur throughout the cycle therefore these cod tn and tp removal results clearly demonstrated that the step feeding mode in ags sbr can be applied in high load wastewater and or with a c n ratio similar to that of leachate favoring granules stability and treatment performance 3 4 cycle experiments the simultaneous conversions and removals of organic nitrogenous and phosphorus constituents were investigated over a complete cycle fig 5 from oxygen analysis during the cycle it was observed that the do was between 2 and 4 mg l during the first 4 h of aeration of r1 and during the first 2 h of aeration of r2 and r3 being in all cases greater than 5 mg l at the end of the aeration period these times coincided with the famine period i e when the available cod is in very low concentrations therefore the famine period coincided with the do increase since the microorganisms enter in the endogenous phase and require lower oxygen concentrations for their metabolism in r1 as soon as cod is practically consumed nitrite begins to accumulate significantly and the nitrate concentration increases slightly simultaneously with ammonia oxidation although r2 had the same profile nitrite accumulation was much lower the low denitrification in r1 and r2 during the oxic period may be associated with the rapid carbon source consumption rate and the absence of an anoxic condition polyhydroxyalkanoates pha accumulation during a short period of cod depletion in the aerobic phase may not be sufficient for the subsequent denitrification in addition the carbon source in the feeding was not fully utilized by denitrification due to microorganisms growth and maintenance which also led to incomplete denitrification and therefore decreasing tn removal in r3 ammonia was completely oxidized without significant nitrite and nitrate accumulations therefore snd during the oxic period was the main mechanism of removing the nitrogen fractions when complete nitrification occurred there was still enough time in the oxic phase for the remaining nitrite to be converted to nitrate by nobs since in this reactor configuration free ammonia did not cause toxicity to nobs according to wang et al 14 nob was much more sensitive to fa than aob it is important to mention that heterotrophic denitrification can also occur using eps as an electron donor during the starvation period it is possible that at the end of the oxic phase the extracellular content initially produced was used as an electron donor to remove nitrogenous fractions endogenously in addition from the data obtained it is possible to point out that a fraction of the partial nitrification product was denitrified and the remaining fraction underwent complete nitrification to be subsequently denitrified such results were similar to those of chen et al 15 in which a step feeding strategy created exclusive and ideal conditions for denitrification right after the total ammonia oxidation without relying solely on the anoxic zone within the granules during the cycle a low ph variation was also observed in r1 7 0 7 1 and in r2 and r3 7 1 7 9 probably due to the balance in alkalinity consumption and production during nitrification and denitrification respectively snd this profile is also in line with other investigations that have observed that step feeding positively influences the distribution of the main functional groups of microorganisms and the microbiota responsible for the denitrification process may change positively 13 14 32 thus microorganisms that remove phosphorus can also use the nitrogen products from nitrification as electron acceptors which favors the high tp removal in r3 38 therefore it is possible to verify that the removal of nitrogenous constituents may have occurred from different processes the accumulated nitrogen fraction was immediately converted using the influent organic matter as an electron donor during the feeding period performing exogenous denitrification in the oxic periods the snd process prevailed for ammonia conversion during the step feeding r3 other nitrogenous fractions were removed endogenously using the intracellular organic constituents as electron donors therefore the cycle that showed the best performance was the one used in r3 since without affecting granules sedimentation and stability the three feast periods interspersed with famine periods were sufficient for nitrification facilitating denitrification due to the availability of cod in the feast periods distributed throughout the cycle and obtaining high phosphorus removals this is excellent for treating more complex wastewater because the nitrification and denitrification processes generally depend on the amount of influent available organic matter 4 conclusions step feeding r3 minimized three great problems of leachate treatment in ags systems granules stability biomass retention and nitrite accumulation compared to fast r1 and slow r2 feeding step feeding achieved the best tp 53 and tn 92 removals it also kept low carbon concentrations during the oxic period which accelerated the ammonia conversion process favored denitrification and reduced the oxygen demand to remove organic matter this is notable because the operation mode can reduce extra carbon addition for denitrification expanding its practical application especially for wastewater with high recalcitrant loads such as sanitary landfill leachate declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper 
13277,we evaluated the impact of feeding strategy on the performance and operational stability of aerobic granular sludge ags treating high strength ammonium concentrations synthetic wastewater with characteristics close to those found in sanitary landfill leachate was applied in sequential batch reactors sbr for biomass cultivation in this sense differing only in the feeding method three identical 7 6 l working volume reactors were operated with the same total cycle time of 12 h duration in r1 and r2 it was adopted feeding in the anaerobic period with a duration of 20 min fast and 40 min slow respectively in r3 feeding was distributed throughout the cycle step feeding half of which was introduced initially and the other half divided equally with 40 and 60 of the cycle substrate distribution throughout the cycle r3 minimized three of the biggest problems faced when treating leachate in ags systems granules stability biomass retention and nitrite accumulation besides compared to fast r1 and slow r3 feeding this mode of operation obtained the best total phosphorus tp 53 and total nitrogen tn 92 removals without any nitrite or nitrate accumulations cod removals were very similar in r2 and r3 but tn and tp removals were significantly greater in r3 therefore the feeding method directly interferes with the performance granules characteristics and system stability the results obtained in this research can be used in future works applying the ags technology for sanitary landfill leachate and other complex wastewaters treatment graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords aerobic granular sludge concentrated wastewaters leachate treatment step feeding 1 introduction leachate treatment from sanitary landfills has been carried out mainly by classic biological processes however landfill age ends up limiting the application of these processes due to toxicity by free ammonia fa and free nitrous acid fna in old landfills 10 years 1 2 this complex wastewater is characterized by high concentrations of total nitrogen tn especially ammonia recalcitrant organic matter and low biodegradability bod5 cod 0 1 heavy metals inorganic salts and xenobiotic organic compounds 3 5 new alternatives to conventional biological treatments have been sought to cover all landfills leachate characteristics and the aerobic granular sludge ags system technology has been considered promising especially for its capacity of carrying out almost all biological conversions in a single system i e organic matter nitrification denitrification and phosphorus removals 6 7 however operational strategies must be adopted to minimize the problems reported by several authors lee et al 39 lin et al 40 such as biomass instability long period of granule formation when using real sewage nitrite accumulation low phosphorus removal in some cases among others advances in the use of the ags technology for sanitary landfill leachate treatment are still incipient and include the pre treatment study and optimization of the aeration system 8 9 the comparison with activated sludge process regarding different raw leachate dilutions 2 5 10 and the co treatment with domestic sewage 3 10 therefore there are still many gaps to be filled especially concerning optimizing operational conditions for the formation and maintenance of aerobic granules the feeding mode is one of the key factors in the selection formation and stability of aerobic granules 11 12 the anaerobic filling in sequential batch reactors sbr has been widely accepted in which the duration and influent load are considered efficiency determining factors little studied but with great potential to favor granulation in effluents with high refractory loads such as sanitary landfill leachate step feeding can be an efficient strategy to remove organic matter and nitrogen simultaneously it is known that during biological nitrogen removal denitrification is usually the limiting step due to the lack of a proper carbon source in the leachate to support denitrification 3 5 consequently a high concentration of nitrite no2 or nitrate no3 can be found in the effluent reducing nitrogen removal efficiency in ags denitrification can occur in the anoxic zone of the granules or anoxic phases of the cycle however even before denitrification occurs the influent carbon has already been depleted therefore the substrate distributed throughout the sbr operating cycle can make good use of the influent organic matter as the carbon source allowing nitrification to occur with a lower organic load in the aerobic phase and favoring denitrification 13 14 to date the number of investigations applying the ags technology with step feeding is still limited chen et al 15 obtained tn removals of 93 for granules of 0 7 mm and 95 9 for granules of 1 5 mm without nitrite accumulations however wang et al 14 observed nitrite accumulation in the order of 93 5 reducing tn removal to 70 tn removals were greater than 90 and more significant in c n ratios of 5 1 than 3 1 13 zhong et al 16 achieved tn removals of 89 7 92 4 in step feeding mode and 48 1 59 5 in single feeding mode however all these investigations alternated anoxic phases with oxide phases and worked with low medium influent loads in this context the present research evaluated the feeding impact on the performance and operational stability of ags systems treating high strength ammonium concentrations for this three ags reactors were fed with synthetic effluent with characteristics similar to the leachate from a brazilian sanitary landfill each reactor had a different feeding strategy conventional fast conventional slow and step mainly aiming at increasing biomass retention minimizing nitrite accumulation and favoring phosphorous removal as far as we are concerned step feeding has not been previously investigated for leachate treatment in ags systems 2 material and methods 2 1 experimental set up the experiments were carried out in three identical sbrs inoculated with the same biomass and operated under the same conditions changing only the feeding method the reactors had 7 85 l with working volume of 7 6 l internal diameter of 10 cm height of 100 cm and height to diameter ratio h d of 10 with a 50 exchange volume the total experiment duration was 120 days for r1 and 134 days for r2 and r3 both divided into two periods by changing the sedimentation time ts in the first 40 days of operation the ts was 20 min period i being reduced to 10 min period ii until the experiment completion the reduction in ts favors biomass selection and increases efficiency and long term stability benefiting aerobic granulation 6 the duration of each cycle was 12 h which consisted of feeding 20 40 min aerobic reaction 659 679 min sedimentation 20 10 min and discharge 1 min in the aerobic phase the air was injected by porous fine bubble diffusers through the reactor bottom using an air compressor yuting sun china ensuring a dissolved oxygen do concentration between 2 and 5 mg l systems operation was automated using synchronized timers fig 1 the feeding differentiation in the reactors followed the description below r1 conventional feeding piston flow in anaerobic anoxic phase lasting 20 min fast r2 conventional feeding piston flow in anaerobic anoxic phase lasting 40 min slow r3 step feeding over the cycle in three moments with 50 of the influent volume being introduced at the beginning of the cycle and the other half divided equally with 40 and 60 of the cycle the reactors were operated at room temperature and the reaction temperature was around 28 2 c during the experiment there was no programmed sludge discharge resulting in different sludge retention times srts 2 2 sludge source and synthetic wastewater composition the reactors were inoculated with the same volume of flocculent aerobic sludge from an activated sludge plant treatment domestic sewage fortaleza ceará brazil a synthetic wastewater was used presenting the c n p ratio of 50 10 1 found in the raw leachate from the municipal sanitary landfill west of caucaia asmoc ceará brazil table 1 it is important to mention that heavy metals concentration in the sanitary landfill leachate is usually very low not causing toxicity to the biological treatment 3 10 furthermore heavy metals solubility is reduced due to the higher ph found in old leachate which allows metal precipitates formation along with sorption processes on the colloidal matter surface decreasing the leachate toxicity 17 18 thus the influent synthetic wastewater was composed of 1000 mg cod l of sodium acetate as a carbon source 200 mg l of nh4 n nh4cl as nitrogen source 20 mg l of po4 3 p from kh2po4 as a phosphorus source and 1 ml l of trace element solution as described by rollemberg et al 19 like the asmoc leachate and the ones investigated by ren et al 2 10 the ph was kept close to neutrality being adjusted with sodium bicarbonate 2 3 analytical methods system influent and effluent cod ph nh4 n no2 n no3 n po4 3 p mixed liquor suspended solids mlss mixed liquor volatile suspended solids mlvss and sludge volumetric index svi in 10 e 30 min svi10 and svi30 were analyzed two to three times a week and determined according to apha 41 dissolved oxygen do was measured by a ysi 5000 probe ysi incorporated usa total inorganic nitrogen tin was considered as the sum of nh4 n no2 n and no3 n 20 the content of eps extracellular polymeric substances was also quantified by the modified heat extraction method according to rollemberg et al 19 particle size was measured to determine the granulation process and granules stability using image pro plus software from microscopic images the reactor reaches the aerobic granulation stage only when more than 80 of the biomass had a diameter greater than 0 2 mm 21 the cycle tests were carried out at the end of the experiment period ii when the reactors reached complete stability to understand the sndpr mechanisms simultaneous nitrification denitrification and phosphorus removal concentrations of nh4 n no2 n and no3 n po4 3 p and do were determined as described by li et al 22 2 4 morphology of the granules the structure of the mature granules was analyzed by scanning electron microscopy sem combined with spectrum energy dispersive x rays inspect s50 fei company usa the pretreated consisted of fixing washing and lyophilization according to the methodology described by motteran et al 23 2 5 statistical methods statistical analyses were performed with the origin 2018 computer software using the mann whitney rank sum test to compare the reactor performance at a 95 confidence level the data groups were statistically different when p 0 05 3 results and discussion 3 1 start up formation and stabilization of the granules the three reactors were initially operated with the same sludge source presenting about 3 4 g l of mlss mlvss mlss ratio of 88 and svi30 of 190 ml g the evolution of these parameters throughout the experiment is shown in fig 2 after start up the mlss concentration gradually decreased in both r1 20 min feeding and r2 40 min feeding sedimentation time reduction was a key strategy for promoting granulation however even after biomass stabilization a constant sludge loss washout was observed in these reactors which is very common in ags systems operated with high load wastewaters 24 26 it may indicate the formation of a biomass with high growth of filamentous microorganisms at high rates of substrate transport making them more flocculent as the high influent organic load is not biodegradable there will be impacts on the carbon supply for denitrification which might also result in biomass washout 3 5 8 thus an external addition of soluble cod becomes necessary for ags cultivation when it is intended to treat effluents not favorable to slow growing bacteria development besides distributing the organic load throughout the cycle to reduce toxicity and favor denitrification seems to be an efficient strategy disintegration of the granules was frequent in r2 and mlss concentration was very unstable failing to achieve a consistent regranulation as previously reported for ags systems treating leachate from sanitary landfills granule disintegration also occurred after 50 days of operation and excessive biomass loss was found 3 10 these authors also pointed out that loads above 200 mg l nh3 n favored granules disintegration therefore it becomes evident that the influent cod n ratio is preponderant for the formation and maintenance of stable granules when this ratio is high there is a growth of filamentous microorganisms that can cause granule disintegration 27 28 on the other hand reducing this ratio generates great changes in the microbial community it decreases the eps content impacting nitrification and resistance size and sedimentation capacity of the granules and subsequent biomass loss thus the instability and disintegration of aerobic granules in high influent loads can be attributed to the increase in granule size due to the inability of carbon penetration to the hydrolysis and protein degradation of the granule nucleus and to the loss of microorganisms ability to self aggregate due to reduction of eps protein content 29 30 in r3 step feeding during period i sedimentation time of 20 min despite mlss concentration has increased the svi also increased which indicates a sludge of low sedimentability possibly dispersed or flocculent after reducing the sedimentation time this poor quality sludge was washed out after 30 days of stability there was again a biomass growth significantly improving sedimentability and reaching a mlss concentration similar to the inoculum therefore as in the experiments by wang et al 14 with two feeds throughout the cycle the mlss first decreased and then increased and stabilized these results are also in line with those of wei et al 9 treating leachate without dilution 3 2 g l mlss and bueno et al 3 with 5 leachate diluted in synthetic domestic sewage 3 3 g l mlss therefore r3 had greater solids retention 3 4 g l mlss followed by r2 2 1 g l mlss and r1 1 9 g l mlss also at the end of the operation mlvss proportion in relation to mlss was 90 in r3 88 in r1 and 67 in r2 retention of solids in ags reactors has been one of the difficulties encountered when treating leachate with controversial results and without a defined tendency wei et al 9 and bella and torregrossa 8 obtained a decrease in mlss concentration when they started with 4 and 11 g l mlss respectively and ended the experiments with 3 and 5 g l mlss ren et al 5 10 practically achieved twice the initial mlss concentration while ren et al 10 did not obtain any change apparently the only pattern found is that the higher the leachate concentration the greater the solids loss agreeing with some previous studies 2 3 wang et al 14 point out that the mlss maintenance is mainly linked to the inoculum quality as the high concentration of inoculum sludge causes stronger and more frequent collisions and friction among microorganisms resulting in the microbial self aggregation improvement other causes are high influent carbon and nitrogen loads system operation and dilution factors in terms of sedimentability in all reactors the first falls in the svis were due to the initial biomass washout however except r1 the svi improved a lot after the adaptation period reaching a good stability thus r3 had the best svi30 result 30 ml g while r1 had the worst result with svi30 greater than 120 ml g as in r1 the aeration phase was greater it was expected to present better sedimentability which did not occur however the svi30 was greater than 160 ml g during period i being improved with sedimentation time reduction period ii therefore to improve the sedimentability in r1 lower sedimentation time would be necessary to select the biomass better in addition between 60 and 70 days of operation the sludge from r2 and r3 reached svi30 60 ml g while in r1 it was above 100 ml g therefore the granulation process was better in r3 and r2 respectively since normally mature granules have svi30 between 30 and 80 ml g 31 even with higher carbon and nitrogen loads the results for r3 were similar to those that adopted the same feeding configuration svi30 30 ml g 13 14 and those that used dilutions that varied between 10 and 100 svi30 25 ml g 2 10 these results showed that compared with reactors with fast single feeding r1 and slow single feeding r2 the step feeding distributed throughout the cycle is an excellent strategy to retain biomass and improve sedimentability this configuration inhibits the excessive proliferation of fast growing heterotrophic bacteria through the succession of feast famine conditions it promotes the development of granules of good sedimentation with reinforced structure contributing greatly to the system stability 13 32 besides it has become evident that fast feeding imposes a strong selection pressure making biomass retention and granulation difficult as the cod is not readily oxidized in the anaerobic period and in the first hours of the aerobic reaction ordinary heterotrophic organisms oho begin to develop mainly in filaments being eliminated in the frequent washouts therefore if a large part of the cod is not oxidized at the beginning of the cycle problems with biomass may be more significant as the organic matter present in the leachate is recalcitrant and of low biodegradability a longer time is required for hydrolysis thus an anaerobic feeding with a longer duration favors granulation and studies with longer times than those used in this research are recommended in the case of step feeding the cod toxicity is minimized as it is distributed throughout the cycle favoring the development of beneficial microorganisms for the granulation without being eliminated since the washouts are much less frequent and biomass growth is greater than its loss 3 2 characteristics of the granules the aerobic granules showed some different physical and chemical characteristics table 2 therefore how the reactors were fed affected granules characteristics probably due to the different microbial groups that were favored with each strategy adopted in reactors r2 and r3 it can be seen that the values of svi5 svi10 and svi30 became lower with the sedimentation time decrease this result demonstrates that biomass sedimentability has improved over time being a typical evolution behavior from flocculent sludge to granular sludge the opposite occurred with r1 in which svi5 and svi10 increased with reduced sedimentation time indicating poor sedimentability and filamentous biomass several authors point out that the svi8 svi30 or svi5 svi30 ratios can be considered good predictors of granulation meaning that a value closer to 1 0 indicates that the sludge consists mainly of mature granules 19 33 34 for effluents with high loads they observed that there is a predominance of aerobic granules when this ratio is between 1 2 and 1 8 values above 1 8 characterize an ags thickening thus the results indicate that the granulation in r2 and r3 was better than in r1 whose svi5 svi30 ratio of 1 7 0 3 suggests biomass thickening in addition the higher the leachate proportion the closer to 1 0 will be the svi5 svi30 ratio 3 5 10 with this regard r3 was the best strategy to achieve such a profile the literature also reports that the reactor is considered granular when more than 80 of the biomass has a diameter greater than 0 2 mm 34 therefore the three reactors fit as aerobic granular systems since more than 80 of the granules are larger than 0 2 mm fig 3 in r3 more than 80 of the granules were not only larger than 0 2 mm but larger than 1 0 mm with an average diameter in period ii of 1 0 mm and 1 3 mm at the end of the experiment thus the average diameter of the granules in r3 after 134 days of operation was greater than those obtained in all existing ags studies so far on leachate treatment 0 36 0 60 mm 9 0 80 0 90 mm 8 0 31 mm 10 1 1 mm 5 0 21 0 48 mm 2 10 0 61 mm 3 however some granules with a diameter of 1 5 mm were observed furthermore they were also superior to the granules reported in the studies by wang et al 14 with feeding distributed in two stages of the cycle 1 1 mm and similar to those of chen et al 13 with alternating feeding in 3 times 1 3 mm furthermore as shown in fig 4 only r3 presented a granule with a more stable and uniform surface making it possible to verify the dominance of coccus over bacillus and filamentous bacteria r1 and r2 did not exactly present a uniform granular structure being observed a tangle of filaments however in r2 a more granular structure that tends to uniformity is verified despite not showing dominance of coccus concerning eps these substances are biopolymers consisting of polysaccharides proteins and other substances which play a fundamental role in the granules structure formation and stability in other words they act as a biological glue in which ps and pn are responsible respectively for granule aggregation and mechanical stabilization 6 as expected r1 had a higher total eps content which agrees with rusanowska et al 35 who reported that smaller granules have a higher amount of eps besides the longer aeration phase duration also influences the eps content confirming that eps production is stimulated by the stress caused by the aeration condition 6 however this high eps production in r1 did not result in a better sedimentation capacity of the granules the reported eps results for r2 and r3 were lower than r1 and similar to each other indicating a balance between eps production and consumption as is known eps production occurs mainly during the feast period and its consumption occurs during the famine period so it was expected that in step feeding eps production tended to balance being lower than in the other reactors since the operation produces successive periods of feast famine distributed throughout the cycle in most studies aerobic granules that are stable have a higher protein portion pn than polysaccharides ps being correlated to hydrophobicity therefore because pn promotes ags stability pn ps ratio is a way of characterizing its stability 6 thus the granules in r1 also showed better results pn ps 5 2 than those in r2 pn ps 4 9 and r3 pn ps 3 9 retention of solids has generated inconsistent results among the leachate studies it seems that eps production does not follow a trend as well for instance pn ps ratio was 4 8 9 while it did not exceed 0 6 in other studies 5 10 eps production is influenced by several factors such as aeration time cycle time shear stress reactor settings type of inoculum among others therefore the set of configurations adopted in this study favored eps production and the pn ps ratio possibly improving granules stability and structure 3 3 performance of the reactors during the granulation process the performance of the reactors was evaluated in terms of cod nitrogen and phosphorus table 3 in all reactors the cod removal was high but nitrogen and phosphorus removals had different behaviors and were better with the sedimentation time reduction the fast anaerobic feeding r1 showed total and soluble cod removals statistically different and lower than in r2 with slow anaerobic feeding p 0 001 and the one achieved in r3 with step feeding p 0 001 r3 showed a greater and significantly different total cod removal compared to r2 p 0 001 however there were no statistical differences between r2 and r3 regarding soluble cod removals p 0 604 which may once again emphasize that the constant washouts in r2 may have influenced the total effluent cod concentration regarding total nitrogen tn removal mean values above 50 were observed during the entire operation except r1 in period i and significant statistical differences between the three systems were found p 0 001 as the profile of nitrogenous fractions was different it is worth mentioning that the removal mechanisms were also different there was nitrite accumulation in r1 and r2 being significantly lower in r2 p 0 004 in r3 low nitrite and nitrate concentrations were observed resulting in higher tn removals 92 tn removals in r3 were superior to the values of 75 4 9 and 50 10 reported with real sanitary leachate during the two periods the nitrification process was observed in both r1 and r2 systems with values greater than 70 and increased when the sedimentation time was reduced however in period ii it was possible to verify significant differences between r1 and r2 p 0 001 and between r2 and r3 p 0 008 thus the largest removal of ammonia occurred in r3 99 followed by r2 98 and r1 97 as the mlvss concentration decreased r1 and r2 and remained unchanged r3 after system stability the demand for do did not increase since the aeration flow rate was kept unchanged during the operation nitrifying bacteria activity was not affected favoring nitrification efficiency in addition in r2 during granules disintegration and recurrent washouts ammonia removal was reduced although on some days ammonia removal was restored possibly due to the loss of nitrifying bacteria that were present in the broken granules when washouts occur at higher frequencies the sludge age is reduced and nitrification will be affected if the sludge age is too low according to rollemberg et al 6 several studies have shown that the sludge age is an important parameter for granules stabilization and reactors performance since it is directly related to the maintenance of slow growing bacteria it has been reported that the step feeding mode is effective for making good use of the influent carbon source increasing the denitrification rate and tn removal 15 thus nitrification occurs with a lower organic load in the aerobic phase accelerating the nitrification rate and saving do consumption to oxidize the influent organic matter this feeding mode benefits ammonia oxidizing bacteria aob growth and inhibits nitrate oxidizing bacteria nob accelerating nitrite accumulation 13 14 however in this study no accumulation of nitrite was observed it is important to note that in the later works in addition to the low influent loads the reaction phase was not totally aerobic interspersed with anaerobic anoxic phase which may have contributed to failures in the simultaneous nitrification and denitrification snd besides in r3 there was no solids loss favoring aob and nob maintenance in the system the larger granules of r3 may also have favored snd since this process occurs mainly in granules of larger size in which nitrification occurs in the outer layer and denitrification in the innermost layer anoxic as is known the proportion of denitrified nitrate in relation to the nitrate produced increases with the average granule diameter i e with a greater anoxic layer 19 concerning total phosphorus tp removals the three systems showed significantly different values p 0 001 and were practically unchanged by decreasing the sedimentation time as expected r1 had the lowest tp removals due to the rapid anaerobic feeding and the absence of anaerobic anoxic phases during the cycle r2 presented tp removals similar to traditional ags cycles for low load effluents and smaller than in r3 probably in r2 there may have been competition between phosphate accumulating organisms paos and denitrifying microorganisms in which denitrifying ones may have been favored another probable cause is the presence of glycogen accumulating organisms gaos which have a similar metabolism to paos but do not accumulate phosphorus besides substrate complexity must be considered which may not have favored phosphorus removals in both reactors the best tp removals were in r3 53 in which the three feast moments during the cycle favored the selection of paos it is important to mention that from the 20th to the 35th tp removals in r3 were greater than 80 however there was a reduction to stabilize then probably the bacteria saturated and the efficiency decreased requiring sludge age control zhu et al 36 demonstrated that aerobic granule deterioration occurred more easily in ags systems with high srt of granular sludge and an adequate selective sludge discharge favors process stability bassin et al 37 and rollemberg et al 6 also suggest controlled sludge removal bed or bottom to remove these saturated bacteria and improve phosphorus removal also tp removals in r3 were slightly higher than those by bueno et al 3 when treating higher leachate concentrations in both low and high leachate dilutions ren et al 2 did not obtain phosphorus removal being sometimes even reported negative values therefore it was found that the anaerobic feeding with a longer duration had the best tn and tp removals table 4 for cod removals feeding duration does not seem to interfere with efficiency however the influent load increase negatively impacts cod removal however the step feeding investigated in this work showed a higher cod removal efficiency than all previous studies except for 10 who used influent concentrations of phosphorus much lower than the current investigation tp removal through step feeding was also the highest observed regarding tn removal step feeding showed efficiency greater than 90 also being better than the values reported elsewhere likely because it provides carbon for denitrification to occur throughout the cycle therefore these cod tn and tp removal results clearly demonstrated that the step feeding mode in ags sbr can be applied in high load wastewater and or with a c n ratio similar to that of leachate favoring granules stability and treatment performance 3 4 cycle experiments the simultaneous conversions and removals of organic nitrogenous and phosphorus constituents were investigated over a complete cycle fig 5 from oxygen analysis during the cycle it was observed that the do was between 2 and 4 mg l during the first 4 h of aeration of r1 and during the first 2 h of aeration of r2 and r3 being in all cases greater than 5 mg l at the end of the aeration period these times coincided with the famine period i e when the available cod is in very low concentrations therefore the famine period coincided with the do increase since the microorganisms enter in the endogenous phase and require lower oxygen concentrations for their metabolism in r1 as soon as cod is practically consumed nitrite begins to accumulate significantly and the nitrate concentration increases slightly simultaneously with ammonia oxidation although r2 had the same profile nitrite accumulation was much lower the low denitrification in r1 and r2 during the oxic period may be associated with the rapid carbon source consumption rate and the absence of an anoxic condition polyhydroxyalkanoates pha accumulation during a short period of cod depletion in the aerobic phase may not be sufficient for the subsequent denitrification in addition the carbon source in the feeding was not fully utilized by denitrification due to microorganisms growth and maintenance which also led to incomplete denitrification and therefore decreasing tn removal in r3 ammonia was completely oxidized without significant nitrite and nitrate accumulations therefore snd during the oxic period was the main mechanism of removing the nitrogen fractions when complete nitrification occurred there was still enough time in the oxic phase for the remaining nitrite to be converted to nitrate by nobs since in this reactor configuration free ammonia did not cause toxicity to nobs according to wang et al 14 nob was much more sensitive to fa than aob it is important to mention that heterotrophic denitrification can also occur using eps as an electron donor during the starvation period it is possible that at the end of the oxic phase the extracellular content initially produced was used as an electron donor to remove nitrogenous fractions endogenously in addition from the data obtained it is possible to point out that a fraction of the partial nitrification product was denitrified and the remaining fraction underwent complete nitrification to be subsequently denitrified such results were similar to those of chen et al 15 in which a step feeding strategy created exclusive and ideal conditions for denitrification right after the total ammonia oxidation without relying solely on the anoxic zone within the granules during the cycle a low ph variation was also observed in r1 7 0 7 1 and in r2 and r3 7 1 7 9 probably due to the balance in alkalinity consumption and production during nitrification and denitrification respectively snd this profile is also in line with other investigations that have observed that step feeding positively influences the distribution of the main functional groups of microorganisms and the microbiota responsible for the denitrification process may change positively 13 14 32 thus microorganisms that remove phosphorus can also use the nitrogen products from nitrification as electron acceptors which favors the high tp removal in r3 38 therefore it is possible to verify that the removal of nitrogenous constituents may have occurred from different processes the accumulated nitrogen fraction was immediately converted using the influent organic matter as an electron donor during the feeding period performing exogenous denitrification in the oxic periods the snd process prevailed for ammonia conversion during the step feeding r3 other nitrogenous fractions were removed endogenously using the intracellular organic constituents as electron donors therefore the cycle that showed the best performance was the one used in r3 since without affecting granules sedimentation and stability the three feast periods interspersed with famine periods were sufficient for nitrification facilitating denitrification due to the availability of cod in the feast periods distributed throughout the cycle and obtaining high phosphorus removals this is excellent for treating more complex wastewater because the nitrification and denitrification processes generally depend on the amount of influent available organic matter 4 conclusions step feeding r3 minimized three great problems of leachate treatment in ags systems granules stability biomass retention and nitrite accumulation compared to fast r1 and slow r2 feeding step feeding achieved the best tp 53 and tn 92 removals it also kept low carbon concentrations during the oxic period which accelerated the ammonia conversion process favored denitrification and reduced the oxygen demand to remove organic matter this is notable because the operation mode can reduce extra carbon addition for denitrification expanding its practical application especially for wastewater with high recalcitrant loads such as sanitary landfill leachate declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper

non conventional water resources used in the irrigation sector in many countries particularly in arid countries owing to this and the development of ecological insurance the need to evaluate predict and redesign wastewater treatment plants wwtps is expanding 1 although all wwtp data are easy to assemble it is still difficult to make an effective decision because of the sophisticated relationships of the data consequently it is necessary to find an appropriate methodology for wwtp modelling and evaluating plant efficiency 2 moreover owing to the territorial distinction of the wastewater quality and different human habits it is difficult to establish a coordinated relationship that can portray wastewater activity through all anticipated circumstances 3 furthermore the sophisticated relations between the chemical physical and biological treatment techniques applied in wwtps present nonlinear practices that are difficult to depict using straight numerical models 4 therefore using various

smoothed lstm and smoothed lstm to forecast the key features of a wwtp influent temperature influent flow influent and effluent bod5 effluent chloride and power utilization according to mentioned references all previous models proposed to provide better anticipation of the treated effluents of wwtps they focused on predicting the number of pollutants in treated wastewater based on previously monitored values over a limited period not exceeding three years also they have used a simple design of tf dfb dcb and dltsf in the wwtp field furthermore only a few parameters were taken into account in each investigation based on the previous discussion various issues should be addressed including the consideration of field data over a long period of time the development of improved machine learning technique systems to give accurate models and the assessment of more parameters in the wwtp in the same study due to the lack of the wwtp time series forecasting models in the literature there is a need for more solid and effective forecasting models for all sorts of comparable difficulties this study was carried out in order to address some of the above discussed issues applied neural network models were developed using five wastewater parameters tss cod bod5 ammonia and sulphide associated with wwtp effluents in egypt al berka wwtp the dcb dfb and dltsf network structures have all been enhanced resulting in new network designs that improve the outcomes the models were developed based on the data obtained over eight years to achieve more accurate results two methods were proposed the first method provides a comparison between three prediction models the traditional feed forward tf deep feed forward backpropagation dfb and deep cascade forward backpropagation dcb networks the second method implements deep learning time series forecasting dltsf using a long short term memory lstm network for wastewater treatment 2 materials and evaluation metrics 2 1 plant description the selected plant for this study was the el berka wwtp bwwtp located in northeast cairo in the eastern desert of egypt fig 1 the plant uses activated sludge as a biological treatment technology for wastewater treatment it receives 600 000 m3 day of wastewater which is equivalent to the waste from approximately 3 million people the final effluent discharges into the gabal el asfar drain that flows to the bilbays drain and then into the bahr ei baqar drain and lake manzala finally it flows into the mediterranean fig 1 40 2 2 data collection daily records over eight years from 2011 to 2018 were obtained from the treatment plant and a comprehensive analysis of the influent wastewater and effluent treated water was carried out for five parameters bod5 cod tss ammonia and sulphide table s1 in the supplementary information si presents a detailed list of the field data used in this assessment all parameters were analyzed according to standard methods 41 42 2 3 evaluation metrics generally networks store the information regarding their corresponding loads the activity of deciding network loads is called training learning or preparing wherein a set of information is converted to known yield information 43 a generous hindrance in the preparation cycle is minimizing errors between the observed and anticipated yield in the layer through numerous factual standards 44 the statistical assessment measurements utilized for network preparation in the current work were mean square error mse mean absolute error mae root mean square error rmse mean absolute percentage error mape the coefficient of determination r squared and coefficient of connection r 45 these parameters were determined using the following equation 1 mae 1 n a n x a y a 2 mse 1 n a n x a y a 2 3

total number of measurements x a are the actual values y a are the corresponding estimated values x is the mean of the actual values of the x variables and y is the mean of the estimated values in y variables 3 methodology the design of the proposed model is established using learning based data driven multi classification and time series forecasting the proposed model structure has two stages prediction and forecasting fig 2 this was decided based on the findings in the literature as most researchers work in one stage and one or two parameters we didn t find similar techniques which give us the advantages over the literature the prediction stage comprises three different networks tf dfb and dcb networks here a comparison of the three networks was performed subsequently dltsf was used to forecast future time step values several stages were completed during the model advancement process as follows 3 1 data collection and pre processing before running the proposed networks the collection data were divided into training validation and testing the dataset was split into two parts that is the data for first seven years were used as the training 52 of the dataset and validation 32 of the dataset set and the data for the last year were used as the verification test 12 of the dataset set 3 2 prediction stage in this study the network structure training rate in wastewater treatment of el berka plant was investigated for five key descriptive variables tss cod bod5 ammonia and sulphide the wwtp data samples from 2011 to 2017 were used as input data in the models while the data from 2018 was kept for model verification 3 2 1 traditional feed forward tf model design the output node is termed the output neuron and all output combined neurons are called the output layer if only a single output is considered the output layer consists of one neuron each of the m nodes in the center is called a hidden neuron all collectively hidden neurons are called a hidden layer inputs are often referred to input neurons and all input neurons are referred to the input layer fig 3 46 there are numerous types of anns perhaps the most widely recognized neural network used in this work is the traditional feed forward tf network wherein the data are communicated in a forward manner only the developed neural network model in matlab presents a platform to simulate any conditions and it successfully predicts peak concentrations the network properties of the prediction stages are summarized in table 1 karunanithi et al 47 confirmed that the number of hidden layers depends on the problem conditions on the off chance that the number of nodes in the hidden layer is less the network might not have enough levels of autonomy to finish the interaction effectively however if the number is too high the preparation will take a lot of time and the network may now and then over fit the data therefore in this study different values of hidden layers and neurons in each hidden layer were applied to discover the ideal model as shown in fig 4 there are no norms or rules to decide the most reasonable network a few preliminaries for each gathering have been directed to an appropriate learning rate some hidden layers and the number of neurons per hidden layer were also obtained 3 2 2 deep feed forward back propagation dfb network the dfb network is a multilayer neural network a graphical representation of this network is presented in fig s2 the dfb network includes six independent layers one input layer four hidden layers and one output layer the input layer obtains the input values as a matrix representation of the neuron that enters the network fig 5 while the output layer provides the predicted output 48 the output equation of layer n is given below 6 a n f n w n a n 1 b n n 1 m where w a n 1 b and a n represent the neuron vector weights input bias and output respectively and the number of nodes in the four hidden layers is ten nodes each the four hidden layer activation levels n i n of the n layer depend on the biases and weights of the layer as presented in the following equation 7 n i n j 1 s n 1 w ij n a j n 1 b i n 3 2 3 deep cascade forward backpropagation network dcb the dcb network is a multi layer neural network with a direct connection between the input hidden and output layers each layer is connected directly with the primary layer providing a skip connection the graphical representation is shown in fig 6 the dcb network includes six layers one input layer four hidden layers and one output layer the input layer receives the input values as a matrix representation of the neuron that enters the network whereas the output layer provides the predicted output 48 each hidden layer has ten nodes and one bias and the number of weights in each layer is equal to the number of previous layers 3 3 forecasting stage a dltsf was proposed for simulating the el berka wwtp based on a lstm in recent years recurrent neural networks rnns have been considered the most effective tools in machine learning for solving different forecasting tasks lstm is used in different applications designed by hochreiter and schmidhuber 49 the network includes seven layers the input layer three lstm layers two fully connected layers and a regression output layer fig 7 the lstm architecture comprises an rnn in which the evolution state depends on the previous time step entry and current entry lstms learn from previous experiences and use method corresponding to data in the computer s memory data can be saved read or written from a network cell moreover this type of design can limit error propagation in different layers over time this technology allows the network to extend its learning process over various periods 50 fig 8 displays how the gate neglects updates and yields the cell and hidden states the lstm layer learnable weights are the input weights w and bias b the matrices w and b are concatenations of the input weights and bias of each element respectively the cell state equation is given as 8 c t f t c t 1 i t g t where denotes the element wise multiplication of vectors i f g and o denote the input gate forget gate cell candidate and output gate respectively the hidden state at time step t is given as follows 9 h t ot σc c t where σ c denotes the state activation function 4 results and discussions 4 1 field data analysis fig 9 shows the fluctuation in the removal efficiency for tss bod5 cod ammonia and sulphide over the years these fluctuations may return to the various influent concentrations of the parameters during summer and winter over the time table 2 illustrates a statistical summary of the effluent monitored parameters which indicates the necessity to raise the wwtp efficiency for achieving the permissible limits of the treated wastewater parameters this would save the surrounding surface water or groundwater resources from the continuous accumulation of disposal pollutants from the previous eight years of daily reports on the el baka wwtp 51 it was found that the efficiency of the plant decreased in the summer months during which the amount of influent raw sewage increased therefore a statistical analysis is required to determine the correlation between the removal efficiency and influent flow statistical tests were performed by computing pearson s correlation coefficient r values table 3 shows the correlation matrix for the removal efficiencies of the five parameters and the average influent flow the matrix showed a positive correlation of bod5 cod and tss with the average flow r 0 50 this also confirms that the plant s design capacity must be increased by building an extended area or converting the extra flow to a new plant for avoiding a negative impact on the environment around the plant 4 2 prediction models results in this study the proposed methods for modelling the removal ratio of the bod5 cod tss ammonia and sulphide were trained using three methods the tf dfb and dcb matlab software was used to implement and execute the proposed model the regression factor r for the proposed models with the three training methods tf dfb and dcb were plotted for modelling the bod5 cod tss ammonia and sulphide contents the cod regression factor results for the training validation and test datasets for the tf dfb and dcb methods are shown in figs 10 12 respectively the yield effectively tracked the objectives associated with the training of cod with r values being 0 94702 0 95819 and 0 96517 for tf dfb and dcb respectively the r values for the three models were acceptable and it highlighted the ability of the dcb model to give the closest r value to 1 which indicated the superiority of the dcb model over the tf and dfb models the regression factors for other parameters bod5 tss ammonia and sulphide for the three proposed methods are presented in the supplementary materials si see figs s2 to s13 the illustrated regression factors showed that the fitting results and conversion were acceptable for all the models however optimizing the parameters with the dcb model generated regression factors much closer to 1 as compared to those generated using the tf and dfb methods fig 13 shows a comparison between the measured cod removal ratio and the output cod removal ratio from the tf dfb and dcb models this figure demonstrates that the cod removal ratios obtained from all models were close to those of the measured removal ratios thereby indicating that all the models were accurate and valid furthermore the proposed dcb model helps to minimise the distinction between the model and measured outputs resulting in a minimal relative error as compared to those obtained using tf and dfb models figs s14 s17 in si file show a comparison between the measured bod5 tss sulphide and ammonia removal ratios along with their output removal ratios obtained from the tf dfb and dc models respectively the deviations between the bod5 measured values and the output values of the three models are presented in fig s14 the results of the three models show acceptable closeness to the measured bod5 however a better consistency may be needed this could be achieved by further training or through the application of another model for tss the dfb model coincided with the measured values better than the tf and dcb models see fig s15 notably the dcb model presented the best coincidence for sulphide and ammonia see figs s16 and s17 the statistical analyses used to check the exactness of the proposed tf dfb and dcb models for modelling the cod bod5 tss sulphide and ammonia removal ratios were mse mae rmse mape and r squared table 4 the rendering of the proposed tf dfb and dcb models for cod removal ratio was analyzed using the four indices mae rmse mape and r squared from the results presented in table 4 when the tf was used the performance indices the mae rmse mape and r squared were 0 01 2 81 3 56 5 15 and 0 87 respectively in the instance of the dfb model the mae rmse mape and r squared were 0 19 2 72 5 23 4 98 and 0 78 respectively while the mae rmse mape and r squared for training with the dcb model were 0 53 1 95 3 35 3 26 and 0 90 respectively the dcb model s verification findings were also well with r squared and rmse of 0 89 and 0 77 respectively from these results it can conclude that the performance of the dcb model was better than that of the tf and dfb models table s2 in the si also confirms the priority of the dcb model over the tf and dfb models in modelling bod5 tss ammonia and sulphide this result may be associated with the ability of each layer in this model to connect directly with the all followed layer with a skip connection which improves the model to simulate the measured data in different layers the correlations between the observed and predicted values of cod bod5 tss sulphide and ammonia for 2018 are shown in fig s18 several additional discussions can be made for example the dataset remains convergent most of the year even when recreation is employed for entering new data sources therefore the model created in this work exhibits satisfactory speculation ability and gives exact results an additional benefit of the model is that there is no need for any supposition about the scope of discharge or temperature notwithstanding the information data should be reliable and the controlling variables for preparing and testing data should be very similar there is no single model applicable for all types of similar issues due to the complicated nature of various wwtp processes as a result developing more robust and effective models was required based on the data provided table 5 summarizes and compares our models to previous studies on wwtp prediction the performance of several models was evaluated using mae mse mape rmse and r squared calculations as shown in table 5 the dcb model showed the highest r squared of 0 89 for cod which is substantially higher than that for other models 20 29 30 32 35 36 37 in the dfb model r squared for the cod was 0 77 which is close to other research 35 37 hvala and kocijan 35 created a parallel serial hybrid model to predict cod with an r squared of 0 81 much lower than this study also the current dcb model achieved an rmse of 0 77 which is lower than previous literature models the predicted value is closer to the actual value with lower rmse values as a result the proposed method is a high precision prediction model based on machine learning models as seen in recent similar studies 4 3 forecasting model results the primary reason for this section is to comprehend the capacities of the dltsf model for forecasting a future condition of the wwtp the data for eight years from the el berka wwtp were used the dataset was divided into two parts the first seven years were used as the training and validation sets and the last year was used as the verification test set the training curves of the tss bod5 cod sulphide and ammonia contents are shown in fig s19 this figure shows the evolution of the dltsf as a function of the iteration number it can be observed that the training data were fit and worked efficiently using the dltsf model fig 14 presents the observed and dltsf forecasting outputs of the tss bod5 cod sulphide and ammonia contents the results show satisfactory competence and accuracy in forecasting the tss bod5 cod and ammonia concentrations in the wwtp wastewater however sulphide forecasting data is not fully coincided with the observed sulphide dataset this may need a special model modification to be only applicable for sulphide forecasting process notably the dltsf forecasting output data especially tss bod5 cod and ammonia contents were consistent with the measured dataset from the el berka wwtp this confirms the validation of the model to forecast future data for wastewater treatment plants fig 15 displays the forecasting errors for the dltsf model for each variable i e tss bod5 cod sulphide and ammonia the anticipating mistake is defined as the distinction between the measured and forecasted worth the removal efficiency error of total suspended solids tss chemical oxygen demand cod biological oxygen demand bod5 sulphide and ammonia is ranging between 0 06 and 3 95 the analysis of the error reveals that the forecasting precision obtained by the dltsf model can fulfil pragmatic necessities and be applicable for full scale wwtps the dltsf model for each variable i e tss bod5 cod sulphide and ammonia was assessed using the rmse as shown in table 6 the rmse value for tss bod5 cod sulphide and ammonia are 1 68 0 85 2 05 and 4 56 respectively the rmse indicates the reliability of the dltsf as a valuable forecasting method for all the five parameters the minimum rmse was 0 85 for bod5 and the maximum was 4 56 for ammonia this may be due to the high fluctuation of ammonia in the measured data which may require more datasets for training however the bod5 dataset has the best consistency as compared to the other four parameters i e tss cod sulphide and ammonia this helps to finalize the best model for the available dataset rmse is used to analyze the performance of models only two pieces of research for wwtp time series forecasting have been founded in the literature related to our research yaqub et al 38 applied a simple lstm model for cod forecasting which gained an rmse of 10 89 also cheng et al 39 introduced the lstm model for bod5 forecasting that gained an rmse of 2 02 the proposed model performance indicated a higher rmse over the literature model with rmse of 3 36 for cod and 1 92 for bod5 5 conclusions the relevance of utilizing the appropriate machine learning techniques as a prediction booster and time series forecasting for el berka wwtp was assessed in this study the following findings have been derived considering the outcome of recent literature for wwtp data prediction the current study introduced more powerful prediction models tf dfb and dcb for the wwtp also it presented a convenient and efficient time series forecasting model dltsf for the wwtp the models result indicated a positive correlation between the measured data bod5 cod and tss and the average flow of the wwtp a high relationship coefficient r existed between the measured and anticipated factors 0 94702 0 95819 and 0 96517 with three types of prediction models tf dfb and dcb respectively the r squared values for the three models were acceptable and it highlighted the ability of the dcb model to give the highest r squared value to 0 89 for cod all proposed designed models had an acceptable outcome also the dcb model introduces the most effective model for predicting the removal efficiency of the wwtp and it is highly recommended as an essential performance appraisal instrument for plant decision makers a dltsf was also used to simulate the removal efficiency of bod5 cod tss ammonia and sulphide for the wwtp it showed high proficiency in time series forecasting of the five tested parameters over the literature with the smallest rmse of 1 92 3 36 2 63 6 45 and 2 35 respectively therefore the key results of this study can be used to fathom and anticipate plant behavior for facilitating plant management enhancing system reliability

13278,expectation of wastewater quality in wastewater treatment plants wwtps is significant and can decrease the sampling number cost decision time and energy this paper presents two methods for predicting and forecasting the removal efficiency of total suspended solids tss chemical oxygen demand cod biological oxygen demand bod5 ammonia and sulphide at el berka wastewater treatment plant egypt the first method uses different prediction models includes the use of traditional feed forward tf deep feed forward backpropagation dfb and deep cascade forward backpropagation dcb networks the tf was generated in three layers input hidden and an output layer the dfb network comprised of six layers an input four hidden and an output layer the dcb network was created with six layers with skip

the dcb model are 1 95 and 0 90 respectively the rmse of dltsf was 0 85 for forecasting of bod5 thus the dcb and dltsf models are recommended for evaluating and predicting the performance of wwtp

wwtps wastewater treatment plants keywords wastewater treatment plant machine learning techniques artificial neural network deep learning techniques 1 introduction wastewater treatment is one of the non conventional water resources used in the irrigation sector in many countries particularly in arid countries owing to this and the development of ecological insurance the need to evaluate predict and redesign wastewater treatment plants wwtps is expanding 1 although all wwtp data are easy to assemble it is still difficult to make an effective decision because of the sophisticated relationships of the data consequently it is necessary to find an appropriate methodology for wwtp modelling and evaluating plant efficiency 2 moreover owing to the territorial distinction of the wastewater quality and different human habits it is difficult to establish a coordinated relationship that can portray wastewater activity through all anticipated circumstances 3 furthermore the sophisticated relations between the chemical physical and biological treatment techniques applied in wwtps present nonlinear practices that are difficult to depict using straight numerical models 4 therefore using various statistical models can provide better spatial and transient connections to improve the comprehension of wastewater treatment 5 recently a few investigations on wastewater treatments were performed while focussing on keen strategies concerning the expectations of the wwtp boundaries implementation of control measures for wwtps and assessment of the attributes of the emanate as per the wwtp influent 6 the most common methodologies and frameworks that have been published in the field of wwtp evaluation are as follows 1 life cycle assessment lca is a useful technique to survey the environmental effects of wastewater treatment 7 10 2 multivariate statistical analysis msa was used to establish reliable and straightforward predictive models to predict the quality of treated and untreated wastewater 5 11 3 partial least analysis pls and principal component analysis pca were developed to obtain data on occasional impact and compositional contrasts in sewage created by industrial and domestic waste 12 13 4 artificial neural networks ann are proven as useful analysis tools to comprehend and mimic the nonlinear conduct of the wwtp and have been implemented as

smoothed lstm and smoothed lstm to forecast the key features of a wwtp influent temperature influent flow influent and effluent bod5 effluent chloride and power utilization according to mentioned references all previous models proposed to provide better anticipation of the treated effluents of wwtps they focused on predicting the number of pollutants in treated wastewater based on previously monitored values over a limited period not exceeding three years also they have used a simple design of tf dfb dcb and dltsf in the wwtp field furthermore only a few parameters were taken into account in each investigation based on the previous discussion various issues should be addressed including the consideration of field data over a long period of time the development of improved machine learning technique systems to give accurate models and the assessment of more parameters in the wwtp in the same study due to the lack of the wwtp time series forecasting models in the literature there is a need for more solid and effective forecasting models for all sorts of comparable difficulties this study was carried out in order to address some of the above discussed issues applied neural network models were developed using five wastewater parameters tss cod bod5 ammonia and sulphide associated with wwtp effluents in egypt al berka wwtp the dcb dfb and dltsf network structures have all been enhanced resulting in new network designs that improve the outcomes the models were developed based on the data obtained over eight years to achieve more accurate results two methods were proposed the first method provides a comparison between three prediction models the traditional feed forward tf deep feed forward backpropagation dfb and deep cascade forward backpropagation dcb networks the second method implements deep learning time series forecasting dltsf using a long short term memory lstm network for wastewater treatment 2 materials and evaluation metrics 2 1 plant description the selected plant for this study was the el berka wwtp bwwtp located in northeast cairo in the eastern desert of egypt fig 1 the plant uses activated sludge as a biological treatment technology for wastewater treatment it receives 600 000 m3 day of wastewater which is equivalent to the waste from approximately 3 million people the final effluent discharges into the gabal el asfar drain that flows to the bilbays drain and then into the bahr ei baqar drain and lake manzala finally it flows into the mediterranean fig 1 40 2 2 data collection daily records over eight years from 2011 to 2018 were obtained from the treatment plant and a comprehensive analysis of the influent wastewater and effluent treated water was carried out for five parameters bod5 cod tss ammonia and sulphide table s1 in the supplementary information si presents a detailed list of the field data used in this assessment all parameters were analyzed according to standard methods 41 42 2 3 evaluation metrics generally networks store the information regarding their corresponding loads the activity of deciding network loads is called training learning or preparing wherein a set of information is converted to known yield information 43 a generous hindrance in the preparation cycle is minimizing errors between the observed and anticipated yield in the layer through numerous factual standards 44 the statistical assessment measurements utilized for network preparation in the current work were mean square error mse mean absolute error mae root mean square error rmse mean absolute percentage error mape the coefficient of determination r squared and coefficient of connection r 45 these parameters were determined using the following equation 1 mae 1 n a n x a y a 2 mse 1 n a n x a y a 2 3

total number of measurements x a are the actual values y a are the corresponding estimated values x is the mean of the actual values of the x variables and y is the mean of the estimated values in y variables 3 methodology the design of the proposed model is established using learning based data driven multi classification and time series forecasting the proposed model structure has two stages prediction and forecasting fig 2 this was decided based on the findings in the literature as most researchers work in one stage and one or two parameters we didn t find similar techniques which give us the advantages over the literature the prediction stage comprises three different networks tf dfb and dcb networks here a comparison of the three networks was performed subsequently dltsf was used to forecast future time step values several stages were completed during the model advancement process as follows 3 1 data collection and pre processing before running the proposed networks the collection data were divided into training validation and testing the dataset was split into two parts that is the data for first seven years were used as the training 52 of the dataset and validation 32 of the dataset set and the data for the last year were used as the verification test 12 of the dataset set 3 2 prediction stage in this study the network structure training rate in wastewater treatment of el berka plant was investigated for five key descriptive variables tss cod bod5 ammonia and sulphide the wwtp data samples from 2011 to 2017 were used as input data in the models while the data from 2018 was kept for model verification 3 2 1 traditional feed forward tf model design the output node is termed the output neuron and all output combined neurons are called the output layer if only a single output is considered the output layer consists of one neuron each of the m nodes in the center is called a hidden neuron all collectively hidden neurons are called a hidden layer inputs are often referred to input neurons and all input neurons are referred to the input layer fig 3 46 there are numerous types of anns perhaps the most widely recognized neural network used in this work is the traditional feed forward tf network wherein the data are communicated in a forward manner only the developed neural network model in matlab presents a platform to simulate any conditions and it successfully predicts peak concentrations the network properties of the prediction stages are summarized in table 1 karunanithi et al 47 confirmed that the number of hidden layers depends on the problem conditions on the off chance that the number of nodes in the hidden layer is less the network might not have enough levels of autonomy to finish the interaction effectively however if the number is too high the preparation will take a lot of time and the network may now and then over fit the data therefore in this study different values of hidden layers and neurons in each hidden layer were applied to discover the ideal model as shown in fig 4 there are no norms or rules to decide the most reasonable network a few preliminaries for each gathering have been directed to an appropriate learning rate some hidden layers and the number of neurons per hidden layer were also obtained 3 2 2 deep feed forward back propagation dfb network the dfb network is a multilayer neural network a graphical representation of this network is presented in fig s2 the dfb network includes six independent layers one input layer four hidden layers and one output layer the input layer obtains the input values as a matrix representation of the neuron that enters the network fig 5 while the output layer provides the predicted output 48 the output equation of layer n is given below 6 a n f n w n a n 1 b n n 1 m where w a n 1 b and a n represent the neuron vector weights input bias and output respectively and the number of nodes in the four hidden layers is ten nodes each the four hidden layer activation levels n i n of the n layer depend on the biases and weights of the layer as presented in the following equation 7 n i n j 1 s n 1 w ij n a j n 1 b i n 3 2 3 deep cascade forward backpropagation network dcb the dcb network is a multi layer neural network with a direct connection between the input hidden and output layers each layer is connected directly with the primary layer providing a skip connection the graphical representation is shown in fig 6 the dcb network includes six layers one input layer four hidden layers and one output layer the input layer receives the input values as a matrix representation of the neuron that enters the network whereas the output layer provides the predicted output 48 each hidden layer has ten nodes and one bias and the number of weights in each layer is equal to the number of previous layers 3 3 forecasting stage a dltsf was proposed for simulating the el berka wwtp based on a lstm in recent years recurrent neural networks rnns have been considered the most effective tools in machine learning for solving different forecasting tasks lstm is used in different applications designed by hochreiter and schmidhuber 49 the network includes seven layers the input layer three lstm layers two fully connected layers and a regression output layer fig 7 the lstm architecture comprises an rnn in which the evolution state depends on the previous time step entry and current entry lstms learn from previous experiences and use method corresponding to data in the computer s memory data can be saved read or written from a network cell moreover this type of design can limit error propagation in different layers over time this technology allows the network to extend its learning process over various periods 50 fig 8 displays how the gate neglects updates and yields the cell and hidden states the lstm layer learnable weights are the input weights w and bias b the matrices w and b are concatenations of the input weights and bias of each element respectively the cell state equation is given as 8 c t f t c t 1 i t g t where denotes the element wise multiplication of vectors i f g and o denote the input gate forget gate cell candidate and output gate respectively the hidden state at time step t is given as follows 9 h t ot σc c t where σ c denotes the state activation function 4 results and discussions 4 1 field data analysis fig 9 shows the fluctuation in the removal efficiency for tss bod5 cod ammonia and sulphide over the years these fluctuations may return to the various influent concentrations of the parameters during summer and winter over the time table 2 illustrates a statistical summary of the effluent monitored parameters which indicates the necessity to raise the wwtp efficiency for achieving the permissible limits of the treated wastewater parameters this would save the surrounding surface water or groundwater resources from the continuous accumulation of disposal pollutants from the previous eight years of daily reports on the el baka wwtp 51 it was found that the efficiency of the plant decreased in the summer months during which the amount of influent raw sewage increased therefore a statistical analysis is required to determine the correlation between the removal efficiency and influent flow statistical tests were performed by computing pearson s correlation coefficient r values table 3 shows the correlation matrix for the removal efficiencies of the five parameters and the average influent flow the matrix showed a positive correlation of bod5 cod and tss with the average flow r 0 50 this also confirms that the plant s design capacity must be increased by building an extended area or converting the extra flow to a new plant for avoiding a negative impact on the environment around the plant 4 2 prediction models results in this study the proposed methods for modelling the removal ratio of the bod5 cod tss ammonia and sulphide were trained using three methods the tf dfb and dcb matlab software was used to implement and execute the proposed model the regression factor r for the proposed models with the three training methods tf dfb and dcb were plotted for modelling the bod5 cod tss ammonia and sulphide contents the cod regression factor results for the training validation and test datasets for the tf dfb and dcb methods are shown in figs 10 12 respectively the yield effectively tracked the objectives associated with the training of cod with r values being 0 94702 0 95819 and 0 96517 for tf dfb and dcb respectively the r values for the three models were acceptable and it highlighted the ability of the dcb model to give the closest r value to 1 which indicated the superiority of the dcb model over the tf and dfb models the regression factors for other parameters bod5 tss ammonia and sulphide for the three proposed methods are presented in the supplementary materials si see figs s2 to s13 the illustrated regression factors showed that the fitting results and conversion were acceptable for all the models however optimizing the parameters with the dcb model generated regression factors much closer to 1 as compared to those generated using the tf and dfb methods fig 13 shows a comparison between the measured cod removal ratio and the output cod removal ratio from the tf dfb and dcb models this figure demonstrates that the cod removal ratios obtained from all models were close to those of the measured removal ratios thereby indicating that all the models were accurate and valid furthermore the proposed dcb model helps to minimise the distinction between the model and measured outputs resulting in a minimal relative error as compared to those obtained using tf and dfb models figs s14 s17 in si file show a comparison between the measured bod5 tss sulphide and ammonia removal ratios along with their output removal ratios obtained from the tf dfb and dc models respectively the deviations between the bod5 measured values and the output values of the three models are presented in fig s14 the results of the three models show acceptable closeness to the measured bod5 however a better consistency may be needed this could be achieved by further training or through the application of another model for tss the dfb model coincided with the measured values better than the tf and dcb models see fig s15 notably the dcb model presented the best coincidence for sulphide and ammonia see figs s16 and s17 the statistical analyses used to check the exactness of the proposed tf dfb and dcb models for modelling the cod bod5 tss sulphide and ammonia removal ratios were mse mae rmse mape and r squared table 4 the rendering of the proposed tf dfb and dcb models for cod removal ratio was analyzed using the four indices mae rmse mape and r squared from the results presented in table 4 when the tf was used the performance indices the mae rmse mape and r squared were 0 01 2 81 3 56 5 15 and 0 87 respectively in the instance of the dfb model the mae rmse mape and r squared were 0 19 2 72 5 23 4 98 and 0 78 respectively while the mae rmse mape and r squared for training with the dcb model were 0 53 1 95 3 35 3 26 and 0 90 respectively the dcb model s verification findings were also well with r squared and rmse of 0 89 and 0 77 respectively from these results it can conclude that the performance of the dcb model was better than that of the tf and dfb models table s2 in the si also confirms the priority of the dcb model over the tf and dfb models in modelling bod5 tss ammonia and sulphide this result may be associated with the ability of each layer in this model to connect directly with the all followed layer with a skip connection which improves the model to simulate the measured data in different layers the correlations between the observed and predicted values of cod bod5 tss sulphide and ammonia for 2018 are shown in fig s18 several additional discussions can be made for example the dataset remains convergent most of the year even when recreation is employed for entering new data sources therefore the model created in this work exhibits satisfactory speculation ability and gives exact results an additional benefit of the model is that there is no need for any supposition about the scope of discharge or temperature notwithstanding the information data should be reliable and the controlling variables for preparing and testing data should be very similar there is no single model applicable for all types of similar issues due to the complicated nature of various wwtp processes as a result developing more robust and effective models was required based on the data provided table 5 summarizes and compares our models to previous studies on wwtp prediction the performance of several models was evaluated using mae mse mape rmse and r squared calculations as shown in table 5 the dcb model showed the highest r squared of 0 89 for cod which is substantially higher than that for other models 20 29 30 32 35 36 37 in the dfb model r squared for the cod was 0 77 which is close to other research 35 37 hvala and kocijan 35 created a parallel serial hybrid model to predict cod with an r squared of 0 81 much lower than this study also the current dcb model achieved an rmse of 0 77 which is lower than previous literature models the predicted value is closer to the actual value with lower rmse values as a result the proposed method is a high precision prediction model based on machine learning models as seen in recent similar studies 4 3 forecasting model results the primary reason for this section is to comprehend the capacities of the dltsf model for forecasting a future condition of the wwtp the data for eight years from the el berka wwtp were used the dataset was divided into two parts the first seven years were used as the training and validation sets and the last year was used as the verification test set the training curves of the tss bod5 cod sulphide and ammonia contents are shown in fig s19 this figure shows the evolution of the dltsf as a function of the iteration number it can be observed that the training data were fit and worked efficiently using the dltsf model fig 14 presents the observed and dltsf forecasting outputs of the tss bod5 cod sulphide and ammonia contents the results show satisfactory competence and accuracy in forecasting the tss bod5 cod and ammonia concentrations in the wwtp wastewater however sulphide forecasting data is not fully coincided with the observed sulphide dataset this may need a special model modification to be only applicable for sulphide forecasting process notably the dltsf forecasting output data especially tss bod5 cod and ammonia contents were consistent with the measured dataset from the el berka wwtp this confirms the validation of the model to forecast future data for wastewater treatment plants fig 15 displays the forecasting errors for the dltsf model for each variable i e tss bod5 cod sulphide and ammonia the anticipating mistake is defined as the distinction between the measured and forecasted worth the removal efficiency error of total suspended solids tss chemical oxygen demand cod biological oxygen demand bod5 sulphide and ammonia is ranging between 0 06 and 3 95 the analysis of the error reveals that the forecasting precision obtained by the dltsf model can fulfil pragmatic necessities and be applicable for full scale wwtps the dltsf model for each variable i e tss bod5 cod sulphide and ammonia was assessed using the rmse as shown in table 6 the rmse value for tss bod5 cod sulphide and ammonia are 1 68 0 85 2 05 and 4 56 respectively the rmse indicates the reliability of the dltsf as a valuable forecasting method for all the five parameters the minimum rmse was 0 85 for bod5 and the maximum was 4 56 for ammonia this may be due to the high fluctuation of ammonia in the measured data which may require more datasets for training however the bod5 dataset has the best consistency as compared to the other four parameters i e tss cod sulphide and ammonia this helps to finalize the best model for the available dataset rmse is used to analyze the performance of models only two pieces of research for wwtp time series forecasting have been founded in the literature related to our research yaqub et al 38 applied a simple lstm model for cod forecasting which gained an rmse of 10 89 also cheng et al 39 introduced the lstm model for bod5 forecasting that gained an rmse of 2 02 the proposed model performance indicated a higher rmse over the literature model with rmse of 3 36 for cod and 1 92 for bod5 5 conclusions the relevance of utilizing the appropriate machine learning techniques as a prediction booster and time series forecasting for el berka wwtp was assessed in this study the following findings have been derived considering the outcome of recent literature for wwtp data prediction the current study introduced more powerful prediction models tf dfb and dcb for the wwtp also it presented a convenient and efficient time series forecasting model dltsf for the wwtp the models result indicated a positive correlation between the measured data bod5 cod and tss and the average flow of the wwtp a high relationship coefficient r existed between the measured and anticipated factors 0 94702 0 95819 and 0 96517 with three types of prediction models tf dfb and dcb respectively the r squared values for the three models were acceptable and it highlighted the ability of the dcb model to give the highest r squared value to 0 89 for cod all proposed designed models had an acceptable outcome also the dcb model introduces the most effective model for predicting the removal efficiency of the wwtp and it is highly recommended as an essential performance appraisal instrument for plant decision makers a dltsf was also used to simulate the removal efficiency of bod5 cod tss ammonia and sulphide for the wwtp it showed high proficiency in time series forecasting of the five tested parameters over the literature with the smallest rmse of 1 92 3 36 2 63 6 45 and 2 35 respectively therefore the key results of this study can be used to fathom and anticipate plant behavior for facilitating plant management enhancing system reliability

13279,total suspended solids tss are the major factors that reduce water quality in a recirculating aquaculture system ras in the present study electrocoagulation ec was used for the first time to increase the particle size of tss in ras and improve the filtration efficiency of the microscreen drum filter mdf without reducing the filtration pore size when the aquaculture water was treated using an electrocoagulation diameter increasing reactor edir for 2 min with current density at 50 a m2 and influent flow at 300 l h the d50 of tss increased by 86 43 an electrocoagulation diameter increasing reactor and microscreen drum filter edir mdf linkage control system was constructed and its application in the ras of litopenaeus vannamei was investigated the working principle of the edir mdf linkage control system is that the output current of edir i edir was feedback controlled by the backwashing interval period of mdf t mdf results showed that the edir mdf linkage control system increased the average removal efficiency of ras for tss chemical oxygen demand cod ammonia and nitrite by 24 07 24 30 8 94 and 1 39 respectively and resulted in average energy consumption and anode loss of edir of 2 38 kwh d 1 68 rmb d and 370 g d 2 22 rmb d graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords recirculating aquaculture system electrocoagulation microscreen drum filter water treatment energy consumption 1 introduction litopenaeus vannamei the most widely cultured shrimp and productive crustacean worldwide exhibits fast growth high yield and strong adaptability 1 the traditionally used shrimp culture model for l vannamei yields large amounts of high quality proteins but it causes marine pollution 2 comparatively the recirculating aquaculture model is more controllable eco friendly water saving and produces higher yields 1 3 during the last decade the recirculating aquaculture system ras has been successfully applied in the industrial farming of l vannamei 1 2 4 in ras the sewage from the aquaculture pond ap is reused after purification with the water treatment equipment at a recycling rate of 90 3 further optimization and improvement of water treatment processes are particularly important for the sustainable development of ras 3 5 generally the aquaculture sewage is initially pretreated using a solid liquid separation equipment to reduce the processing load and energy consumption in subsequent water treatment units 6 the microscreen drum filter mdf is widely used for water treatment in ras due to its small footprint strong processing capacity and simple operation 6 the treatment efficiency of mdf depends on its filter pore size and particle size of total suspended solids tss in the sewage 6 however because of the need to ensure smooth circulation of water in ras it is not feasible to improve the filtration efficiency of mdf by continuously reducing the filter pore size 5 therefore increasing the particle size of tss is another approach to improve the filtration efficiency of mdf ebeling et al 7 used aluminum sulfate to improve the particle size of tss in ras tailwater and enhance the treatment efficiency of the filtration equipment they achieved a tss removal efficiency re of 82 compared with chemical flocculation electrocoagulation ec causes less secondary pollution less sludge output has simple operation and is more controllability 8 9 the ec produces flocculants by sacrificing the anode to adsorb pollutants and increase the particle size of suspended solids ss in sewage 5 10 the coupling technology of ec and filtration has been successfully applied in surface water purification 11 12 industrial wastewater treatment 13 automotive service wastewater treatment 14 and other fields this technology can effectively remove tss 15 chemical oxygen demand cod total nitrogen ammonia microorganism etc 5 8 although ec has been widely used as a novel and promising water treatment technology its application in ras has not yet been reported moreover the majority of previous research on ec technology is based on sewage with uniform and stable pollutants and the output current of ec is kept constant during the sewage treatment 5 10 11 however the water quality of sewage fluctuates during actual production in ras the tss of aquaculture water changes with the types of breeding species feeding frequency and environmental factors 3 when ec technology is applied in actual production the output current of ec should be adjusted continuously according to water quality characteristics of the sewage to ensure that pollutants are removed with minimum energy consumption and avoid secondary pollution caused by excessive metal ions in the present study an electrocoagulation diameter increasing reactor and microscreen drum filter edir mdf linkage control system was constructed in the ras of l vannamei based on changes in tss concentration c tss in aquaculture water the output current of edir i edir was feedback controlled by the backwashing interval period of mdf t mdf in ras t mdf shortens with the increase in tss concentration in aquaculture water 6 a shorter t mdf signifies a decrease in water quality of the ras thus it is necessary to increase i edir to obtain more flocculants and enhance the treatment efficiency of subsequent filtration equipment of note i edir decreases with an increase in t mdf this study provides a novel technical approach to improve the re of tss and optimize the water quality environment of ras 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental set up two devices were used in this study a laboratory scale edir mdf system fig 1a and a pilot scale ras of l vannamei fig 1b the laboratory scale edir mdf system was mainly composed of direct current dc power etm 3080 china programmable time relay ybd 4 24 china electrode plate reaction tank buffer tank and mdf the volumes of the reaction tank and buffer tank were about 10 0 l and 3 0 l respectively the inlet water flow was controlled using a liquid flow meter at 300 l h the hydraulic retention time hrt of the reaction tank was 2 min the dc power of edir was connected to the programmable time relay to create an alternating pulse

return pipe and the influent flow of edir was 6 m3 h about 15 of aquaculture water in the buffer tank was treated using edir and contained large amounts of flocculants in edir there were five sets of anodes fe and five sets of cathodes fe and the arrangement was mp p moreover the gap and total effective area of the electrode with the length of 30 cm width of 25 cm and thickness of 0 3 cm were 2 0 cm and 1 25 m2 respectively the filter area and pore size of mdf was 2 26 m2 and 260 mesh respectively the filling rate of mbbr was 50 and used a 64 hole circular polyethylene bio carrier with a diameter of 2 5 cm and a thickness of 0 4 cm before experiment the ras for l vannamei has been in operation for 2 years and thus the biofilm of mbbr was relatively mature the mdf level switch was used to control the mdf when the mdf level switch was turned on for the first time mdf rotated half a circle and when the mdf level switch was turned on for the second time the mdf underwent a full circle rotation and simultaneously performed backwashing in ras the time taken for mdf to undergo a full circle rotation and backwashing was 9 s the water consumption was about 8 l time and energy consumption was 0 02 kwh time energy consumption by the circulating pump mbbr fs and ultraviolet lamp was about 72 36 13 2 and 12 kwh d respectively 2 2 experimental design step 1 the effect of ec on

92 the dissolved oxygen was 6 93 7 25 mg l and the temperature was 26 8 c before the test a 50 mesh about 300 μm sieve silk was used to filter large ss in the culture water such as shrimp shells and residual feed the current density of the edir was 50 a m2 the influent and effluent of edir were collected to detect the particle size of tss step 2 the relationship between i edir and t mdf was

machine was used in ras at a feeding frequency of 1 4 time h and feeding amount of 3 2 23 6 kg day 0th 60th day the c tss of mdf influent and its corresponding t mdf were recorded daily the detection process was as follows 7 00 8 00 am and 2 00 3 00 pm with 30 min as a detection cycle the mdf backwashing frequency was recorded in each detection cycle to calculate t mdf and the tss concentration in the mdf influent was detected every 5 min to obtain the average c tss a set of c tss and its corresponding t mdf could be obtained from one detection cycle a relationship model between t mdf and c tss was established based on the collected data secondly the relationship model between c tss and actual fe anode dissolution c fe ad by concentration was established in the laboratory scale edir mdf system different c tss ranges were obtained based on the change of mdf influent c tss in ras within 60 days the relationship between threshold points in different c tss ranges and c fe ad was investigated the basis of this relationship is that the re of tss by mdf increased by about 20 when edir was applied finally based on the relationship between t mdf and c tss c fe ad and c tss c fe ad and i edir 17 the relationship between t mdf and i edir was obtained based on the relationship between t mdf and i edir the linkage control system of edir and mdf was constructed in l vannamei ras the opening frequency of the mdf level switch which controlled the backwashing process was uploaded to the ras central control system to calculate the t mdf based on the t mdf the i edir was adjusted to realize the linkage control of the mdf and edir step 3 the performance of the edir mdf linkage control system in l vannamei ras was investigated edir with 3 h as a working cycle operated for 8 h daily

experiment lasted for 21 days the edir mdf linkage control system was shut down in the 0th 7th days no ec stage and started up in the 8th 21st days ec stage the concentration of tss cod ammonia and nitrite in the effluent of ap mdf mbbr and fs and influent of mdf was measured daily edir effluent was replaced with mdf influent to facilitate calculation in addition the backwashing frequency of mdf and the dry weight of mdf residue before and after edir start up were recorded the edir voltage current and anode loss were recorded the application of the edir mdf linkage control system in ras was evaluated by water quality and energy consumption 2 3 analysis method the particle size distribution of tss was detected using a laser particle size distribution analyzer bettersize2000 china the concentrations of tss cod ammonia and nitrite were measured according to the standard methods of the american public health association 18 after the experiment the electrode was cleaned with distilled water and dried at 105 c then weighed using an analytical balance bsm220 3 china salinity ph temperature and dissolved oxygen were measured with a water quality analyzer ysi 556 usa removal efficiency

to develop a simple and easy method for removing fine solids from ras water results shown in fig 2 indicated that ec increased the particle size of tss in aquaculture water notably d10 d50 and d90 of tss in the influent and effluent of edir were 44 44 and 57 25 μm 129 70 and 241 80 μm 297 50 and 484 60 μm respectively application of edir increased the d10 d50 and d90 of tss in aquaculture water by 28 83 86 43 and 62 89 respectively moreover the proportions of suspended solid particle size 75 μm were 23 39 and 14 33 before and after treatment with edir translating to a reduction of about 9 06 the most commonly used mdf mesh size in ras is 75 μm 200 mesh 6 therefore applying ec technology to ras can improve the ability of mdf to remove tss and reduce the deposition of small particle size ss in ras 3 2 construction of the edir mdf linkage control system in ras of l vannamei 3 2 1 relationship between t mdf and c tss of mdf influent t mdf and c tss of mdf influent in ras were measured for 60 days and 231 sets of c tss and its corresponding t mdf were obtained regression analysis of t mdf and c tss was conducted based on the power function relationship between t mdf and c tss of the mdf influent fig 3 the relationship between t mdf and c tss was presented by the formulae c tss 23166t mdf 1 262 r 2 0 9107 3 2 2 relationship between c tss and c fe ad based on changes in c tss of the mdf influent within 60 days seven c tss ranges 0 6 6 12 12 18 18 24 24 30 30 36 and 36 42 mg l were obtained from which seven thresholds 6 12 18 24 30 36 and 42 mg l were selected in the laboratory scale edir mdf system the i edir and c fe ad corresponding to thresholds of different c tss ranges when the tss removal of mdf was increased by 20 by edir are shown in table 1 results shown in table 1 indicate that the re of tss by edir mdf system at a current of 0 a was 50 35 58 67 when edir was turned on the re of tss by mdf increased by 18 41 22 22 interestingly c fe ad was higher than c fe td and φ exceeded 100 with an average of 123 and a maximum of 130 the aquaculture water was rich in chloride ions which produced pitting corrosion on the surface of fe anode and increased the dissolution of the anode resulting in more m fe ad than m fe td 16 zodi et al 20 used an electrocoagulation flotation process to treat dye wastewater and found that average φ was 158 regression analysis of c tss and c fe ad was conducted based on the power function relationship between c tss and c fe ad fig 4 the relationship between c tss and c fe ad was fitted as c fe ad 0 0268c tss 0 321 r 2 0 9813 3 2 3 relationship between t mdf and i edir the relationship between t mdf and i edir was determined using the following four formula conversion c tss 23166 t mdf 1 262 5 c fe ad 0 0268 c tss 0 321 6 m fe

ras within t mdf in ras with edir mdf linkage control system the c fe ad in mdf influent was calculated using formula 8 q l s was the flow rate of the circulating pump in ras after calculation the relationship between t mdf and i edir was obtained eq 9 9 i edir 3217 69 t mdf 1 262 1 66 q φ 3 3 application of the edir mdf linkage control system in l vannamei ras 3 3 1 effects of the edir mdf linkage control system on tss in ras during the operation of ras failure to remove some tss with small particle size results in accumulation of tss 6 chen et al 21 used an elzone model 180xy particle counter to study particle size distribution of tss in the rass under different water treatment processes they found that the proportion of tss 20 μm in the high density ras was 47 an increase in tss concentration may decrease water quality and increase oxygen consumption in the ras as well as the number of pathogenic bacteria all which will threatening the health of cultured organisms 6 previously it was reported that edir can increase the particle size of tss through electro neutralization and flocculation thereby improve the re of mdf for tss 5 ec can also affect the treatment efficiency of biofilters and flotation equipment 22 the removal of tss by each water treatment unit in ras equipped with an edir mdf linkage control system is shown in fig 5 results presented in the figure indicate that in no ec stage 0th 7th day the average concentration of tss in ap mdf mbbr and fs effluent was 22 86 1 81 11 14 0 83 13 57 0 90 and 8 86 0 64 mg l respectively in ec stage 8th 21st day the average concentration of tss in ap mdf mbbr fs effluent and mdf influent was 30 64 2 52 6 36 1 05 8 43 1 29 4 50 1 34 and 33 93 2 96 mg l respectively under the action of the edir mdf linkage control system the tss concentration in mdf mbbr and fs effluent decreased remarkably interestingly the concentration of tss decreased after aquaculture water was treated using mdf and fs but increased after treatment with edir and mbbr edir can increase the particle size of tss through electro neutralization and flocculation improving the re of mdf for tss 5 previous study has found that ec can also affect the treatment efficiency of biofilters and flotation equipment 22 the removal of tss by each water treatment unit in ras equipped with an edir mdf linkage control system is shown in fig 5 from the figure in no ec stage 0th 7th day the average concentration of tss in ap mdf mbbr and fs effluent was 22 86 1 81 11 14 0 83 13 57 0 90 and 8 86 0 64 mg l respectively in ec stage 8th 21st day the average concentration of tss in ap mdf mbbr fs effluent and mdf influent was 30 64 2 52 6 36 1 05 8 43 1 29 4 50 1 34 and 33 93 2 96 mg l respectively under the action of the edir mdf linkage control system the tss concentration in mdf mbbr and fs effluent decreased remarkably interestingly the concentration of tss decreased after aquaculture water was treated using mdf and fs but increased after treatment with edir and mbbr specifically compared with tss concentration in ap effluent tss concentration in mdf influent increased by 2 4 mg l under the action of edir this is due to dissolution of the fe anode during ec to form flocculants which adsorb dissolved pollutants in aquaculture wastewater thereby increasing tss concentration 10 17 notably we found that the average re of tss by mdf was 51 27 and 79 24 in the no ec stage and ec stage respectively when edir mdf linkage control system was applied the re of mdf increased by 27 97 garcía morales et al 13 found that ec enhanced the removal of tss when used to treat chocolate processing wastewater before filtration this method also reduced turbidity by 95 another study found that the combination of ec and ultrafiltration technology removed 85 of tss in poultry processing wastewater and ec suppressed fouling on the membrane of ultrafiltration equipment and enhanced the re of ultrafiltration equipment for tss 23 moreover the average concentration of tss in mbbr effluent increased by 2 43 and 2 07 mg l in the no ec stage and ec stage respectively compared to the tss concentration in mbbr influent mdf effluent this is because the biofilm on the bio carriers ages and is replaced during the operation of mbbr and the shed biofilm increases tss concentration in mbbr effluent 24 of note under the effect of edir tss concentration in mbbr effluent was reduced by 14 57 this could be explained by the following two reasons 1 the flocculants improved adsorption and interception of tss by mbbr 2 the iron based flocculants changed the structure of the biofilm making it compact and difficult to fall off 25 26 chakraborty et al 27 applied electrocoagulation and sequencing batch reactor ec sbr technology to treat a mixture of municipal sewage and landfill leachate and found that the re of tss by sbr was increased by 21 under the action of ec in the ec stage the removal of tss by fs was reduced which was mainly due to the reduction of tss load in fs influent by 36 26 therefore under the effect of the edir mdf linkage control system the fs scale can be adjusted appropriately to reduce operation and construction costs overall the average re of tss in ras was 61 24 and 85 31 in the no ec stage and ec stage respectively application of edir mdf linkage control system increased the re of ras for tss by 24 07 an increase in re of tss in ras improves the water quality 6 the impact of edir mdf linkage control system on the aquaculture water of ap is shown in fig 6 in the no ec stage 7th day the aquaculture water was turbid and pale yellow with foam floating on the surface however under the action of the edir mdf linkage control system the aquaculture water became clearer and foam free 11th day 3 3 2 effects of the edir mdf linkage control system on cod in ras effective removal of cod also guarantees stable operation of ras 6 the effects of the edir mdf linkage control system on cod concentration in ras are shown in fig 7 in the no ec stage 0th 7th day the average concentration of cod in ap mdf mbbr and fs effluent was 9 16 0 69 6 10 0 33 4 78 0 14 and 4 50 0 11 mg l respectively the average re of cod by mdf mbbr and fs was 33 41 14 41 and 3 06 respectively in the ec stage 8th 21st day the average concentration of cod in ap mdf mbbr fs effluent and mdf influent was 12 97 1 38 7 08 0 47 4 26 0 17 3 22 0 33 and 12 84 1 36 mg l respectively the average re of cod by edir mdf mbbr and fs was 0 97 44 19 21 60 and 7 89 respectively the re of mdf mbbr and fs for cod was significantly increased when edir was applied during ec when the anode is oxidized and dissolved a series of side reactions occur these reactions produce active oxidation substances such as free chlorine and active oxygen which can degrade cod 12 xu et al 5 found that when fe electrode was used as the anode the current was 1 23 a the influent flow was 67 l h and the treatment time was 4 5 min the ec reactor could remove 22 97 0 30 of cod in mariculture tailwater the initial concentration of cod was 12 44 mg l edir can remove cod by electro oxidation and the re is closely related to the current and influent flow 20 in this experiment the re of edir for cod was only 0 97 0 21 which was attributed to the large influent flow notably the edir mdf linkage control system removed 45 16 of the cod in the ap effluent after opening edir the average re of mdf for cod increased by 10 92 this is because tss contains a large amount of cod 6 ec increased the re of mdf for tss by releasing flocculants which increased the re of mdf for cod mostafazadeh et al 28 used a combination of ec and ultrafiltration technology to treat laundry wastewater and found that when the current was 400 a m2 an fe electrode was used as the anode the filtration pore diameter was 0 02 μm and the hrt was 45 min the re of system for cod was over 80 and the re of cod by the ultrafiltration equipment increased by about 30 under the action of ec xu et al 5 removed cod from mariculture tailwater using ec mdf technology and the results showed that when the current density was 19 22 a m2 an fe electrode was used as the anode the filtration pore diameter was 63 μm and the hrt was 4 5 min the re of ec mdf system for cod was about 37 and the re of mdf increased by about 9 8 under the action of ec the ec technology can improve the cod removal of biological treatment and flotation 22 29 the average amount of cod removed by mbbr was 1 32 0 19 and 2 82 0 47 mg l in the no ec stage and the ec stage respectively under the effect of the edir the removal capacity of cod by mbbr increased by 114 this could be explained as follows 1 ec increased the adsorption and retention capacity of mbbr for tss which contained cod 2 ec improved the bio degradability of aquaculture water 30 3 the fe ion produced by ec improved the activity of microorganisms in mbbr increasing its treatment efficiency for cod 25 26 using ec sbr water treatment technology to purify a mixture of municipal sewage and landfill leachate chakraborty et al 27 found that the re of cod by sbr was increased by 33 under the action of ec the study also found that edir enhanced the re of fs for cod the average amount of cod removed by fs was 0 23 and 1 04 mg l in the no ec stage and the ec stage respectively under edir action the re of fs for cod increased by 352 fs can remove cod by separating dissolved and suspended organic matter 6 sokolov et al 31 found that cationic flocculants could improve the removal of cod in the flotation process another study found that iron based flocculants produced by ec adsorbed tiny ss and dissolved pollutants in the laundry wastewater to form flocs the flocs were brought to the surface of the water by microbubbles thereby improving the re of the flotation process for pollutants 29 overall the average re of ras for cod was 50 87 and 75 17 in the no ec stage and the ec stage respectively the edir mdf linkage control system improved the re of ras for cod by 24 30 3 3 3 effect of the edir mdf linkage control system on ammonia and nitrite in ras ammonia and nitrite produced in the ras pose a health threat to organisms 5 therefore successful breeding requires that ammonia and nitrite are removed from the ras 6 the influence of edir mdf linkage control system on ammonia and nitrite concentration in ras is shown in fig 8 in the no ec stage the average concentration of ammonia and nitrite in ap mbbr and fs effluent was 0 55 0 04 and 0 054 0 005 mg l 0 43 0 04 and 0 036 0 005 mg l and 0 40 0 04 and 0 036 0 005 mg l respectively the average re of ammonia and nitrite by mbbr and fs was 22 14 2 16 and 32 82 4 87 and 5 13 1 50 and 1 13 1 92 respectively in the ec stage the average concentration of ammonia and nitrite in ap mbbr and fs effluent and mdf influent was 0 58 0 07 and 0 072 0 006 mg l 0 40 0 06 and 0 048 0 003 mg l 0 37 0 06 and 0 047 0 003 mg l and 0 57 0 07 and 0 073 0 006 mg l respectively the average re of ammonia and nitrite by edir mbbr and fs was 1 86 0 78 and 0 74 0 88 28 07 4 80 and 33 40 6 75 and 6 07 1 65 and 1 76 1 87 respectively these results showed that treatment with edir decreased the concentration of ammonia in the aquaculture water and increased the concentration of nitrite slightly edir degraded ammonia and nitrite through active oxidizing substances produced by the electrooxidation process the ammonia was firstly oxidized to nitrite which was in turn oxidized to nitrate 5 due to the large influent flow active oxidants produced by edir in the present experiment were insufficient to completely convert ammonia into nitrate increasing nitrite concentration xu et al 5 used ec technology to treat mariculture tailwater and found that when fe electrode was used as the anode the current was 1 23 a the influent flow was 67 l h and the treatment time was 4 5 min the re of ammonia and nitrite was 63 19 1 69 and 67 42 3 47 respectively in addition the study found that mbbr played a dominant role in the removal of ammonia and nitrite previous researches have shown that ras mainly relies on biotransformation to remove ammonia and nitrite 3 6 therefore improving the nitrification of mbbr may help to optimize the water environment in ras as shown in fig 7 after switching on the edir mdf linkage control system the removal of ammonia and nitrite by mbbr increased specifically the amount of ammonia and nitrite removed by mbbr was 0 12 and 0 018 mg l and 0 17 and 0 025 mg l in the no ec stage and ec stage respectively under the action of the edir mdf linkage control system the removal capacity of ammonia and nitrite by mbbr increased by 41 67 and 38 89 respectively previous studies reported that ec can improve the efficiency of the biological treatment process especially when fe electrode is used as the anode by promoting the activity of nitrifying bacteria 25 26 30 qian et al 32 found that fe3 can increase the number of nitrosomonas and nitrobacter in sbr and improve the re of ammonia nitrogen and nitrite nitrogen li et al 33 combined ec with submerged membrane bioreactor technology to treat sewage and found that the fe electrode could increase the activity of enzymes related to nitrification interestingly in the ec stage the re of fs for ammonia and nitrite increased this can be explained by the following two aspects 1 fe3 increased the nitrification of the exfoliated biofilm from mbbr in fs 2 the combined result of adsorption of the flocculants and flotation of fs overall the average re of ras for ammonia and nitrite in the no ec stage was 27 27 and 33 33 while that in the ec stage was 36 21 and 34 72 which increased by 8 94 and 1 39 respectively 3 3 4 changes in t mdf i edir and energy consumption during the experiment the changes in t mdf and i edir during the experiment are shown in fig 9 t mdf was 242 280 and 172 202 s in the no ec stage and the ec stage and the average t mdf was 262 and 189 s respectively with a difference of 73 s the change in t mdf was marked before and after the edir mdf linkage system was turned on specifically the t mdf on the 8th day was lower by 41 s compared to that on day 7 moreover i edir increased from 51 03 a to 58 86 a with a decrease in t mdf in the ec stage compared with conventional ras ras equipped with edir mdf linkage control consumes more energy mainly due to loss of electric energy and fe anode during edir operation and increased energy consumption of mdf due to edir the energy consumption of mdf edir and ras before and after the ec mdf linkage control system was turned on is shown in table 2 the backwashing frequency the water used for backwashing and the filter residue output dry weight of mdf on the 7th and 8th days were 357 and 430 time d 7 14 and 8 60 m3 14 16 0 24 and 16 35 0 51 g time respectively edir increased the backwashing frequency and filter residue output of mdf the filter residue output of mdf on the 8th day was 7030 50 g whereas that on the 7th day was 5055 12 g representing an increase of 1975 38 g when edir was applied on the 8th day the energy consumed during edir was 2 06 kwh d and the anode loss was 350 g d the power consumption and water consumption of mdf increased by 20 45 and 20 28 relative to the 7th day moreover the energy consumption in ras before 7th day and after 8th day ec was 140 34 and 143 86 kwh d respectively application of edir mdf linkage control system increased energy consumption in the ras by 2 51 in the ec stage the average consumption of electric energy and anode of edir was 2 38 kwh d 1 68 rmb d and 370 g d 2 22 rmb d respectively and the average energy consumption in the ras was 144 74 kwh d 101 21 rmb d although edir can improve the treatment efficiency of mdf mbbr and fs in ras it releases fe3 into aquaculture water which may affect the health of cultured organisms adhikari et al 34 investigated the effect of fe3 on macrobrachium rosenbergii and found that the average growth feed utilization and survival of this species decreased with an increase in fe3 concentration the basic growth parameters of l vannamei during the experiment are shown in table 3 before and after ec the survival rate daily growth rate and feed conversion ratio of l vannamei were 99 2 and 97 3 0 13 and 0 15 cm d 0 17 and 0 18 g d 1 11 and 1 08 respectively these results showed that the edir mdf linkage control system not only improved the water treatment efficiency of ras but also prevented excessive production of metal ions 4 conclusions ec increased the particle size of tss in aquaculture water and enhanced the efficiency of subsequent water treatment equipment when the aquaculture water was treated using ecir for 2 min with a current density of 50 a m2 and influent flow of 300 l h the d50 of tss increased from 129 70 μm to 241 80 μm representing an increase of 86 43 based on the established relationship equation i edir 3217 86t mdf 1 262 1 66 q φ where q l s was the flow of ras and φ was current efficiency an edir mdf linkage control system in the ras was constructed the i edir was feedback controlled using t mdf moreover edir improved the removal of tss by ras and enhanced the nitrification of ras it also increased the backwash frequency and filter residue output of mdf in addition under the action of edir the removal of ammonia and nitrite by mbbr increased by 41 67 and 38 89 respectively application of the edir mdf linkage control system increased the treatment efficiency of ras for tss cod ammonia and nitrite by 24 07 24 30 8 94 and 1 39 respectively for ras with a volume of 90 m3 circulating flow of 40 m3 h and culture density of 1100 shrimps with a body length of 6 0 9 0 cm per m3 the average energy consumption and anode loss of edir were 2 38 kwh d 1 68 rmb d and 370 g d 2 22 rmb d respectively declaration of competing interest the authors declared that they have no conflicts of

13279,total suspended solids tss are the major factors that reduce water quality in a recirculating aquaculture system ras in the present study electrocoagulation ec was used for the first time to increase the particle size of tss in ras and improve the filtration efficiency of the microscreen drum filter mdf without reducing the filtration pore size when the aquaculture water was treated using an electrocoagulation diameter increasing reactor edir for 2 min with current density at 50 a m2 and influent flow at 300 l h the d50 of tss increased by 86 43 an electrocoagulation diameter increasing reactor and microscreen drum filter edir mdf linkage control system was constructed and its application in the ras of litopenaeus vannamei was investigated the working principle of the edir mdf linkage control system is that the output current of edir i edir was feedback controlled by the backwashing interval period of mdf t mdf results showed that the edir mdf linkage control system increased the average removal efficiency of ras for tss chemical oxygen demand cod ammonia and nitrite by 24 07 24 30 8 94 and 1 39 respectively and resulted in average energy consumption and anode loss of edir of 2 38 kwh d 1 68 rmb d and 370 g d 2 22 rmb d graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords recirculating aquaculture system electrocoagulation microscreen drum filter water treatment energy consumption 1 introduction litopenaeus vannamei the most widely cultured shrimp and productive crustacean worldwide exhibits fast growth high yield and strong adaptability 1 the traditionally used shrimp culture model for l vannamei yields large amounts of high quality proteins but it causes marine pollution 2 comparatively the recirculating aquaculture model is more controllable eco friendly water saving and produces higher yields 1 3 during the last decade the recirculating aquaculture system ras has been successfully applied in the industrial farming of l vannamei 1 2 4 in ras the sewage from the aquaculture pond ap is reused after purification with the water treatment equipment at a recycling rate of 90 3 further optimization and improvement of water treatment processes are particularly important for the sustainable development of ras 3 5 generally the aquaculture sewage is initially pretreated using a solid liquid separation equipment to reduce the processing load and energy consumption in subsequent water treatment units 6 the microscreen drum filter mdf is widely used for water treatment in ras due to its small footprint strong processing capacity and simple operation 6 the treatment efficiency of mdf depends on its filter pore size and particle size of total suspended solids tss in the sewage 6 however because of the need to ensure smooth circulation of water in ras it is not feasible to improve the filtration efficiency of mdf by continuously reducing the filter pore size 5 therefore increasing the particle size of tss is another approach to improve the filtration efficiency of mdf ebeling et al 7 used aluminum sulfate to improve the particle size of tss in ras tailwater and enhance the treatment efficiency of the filtration equipment they achieved a tss removal efficiency re of 82 compared with chemical flocculation electrocoagulation ec causes less secondary pollution less sludge output has simple operation and is more controllability 8 9 the ec produces flocculants by sacrificing the anode to adsorb pollutants and increase the particle size of suspended solids ss in sewage 5 10 the coupling technology of ec and filtration has been successfully applied in surface water purification 11 12 industrial wastewater treatment 13 automotive service wastewater treatment 14 and other fields this technology can effectively remove tss 15 chemical oxygen demand cod total nitrogen ammonia microorganism etc 5 8 although ec has been widely used as a novel and promising water treatment technology its application in ras has not yet been reported moreover the majority of previous research on ec technology is based on sewage with uniform and stable pollutants and the output current of ec is kept constant during the sewage treatment 5 10 11 however the water quality of sewage fluctuates during actual production in ras the tss of aquaculture water changes with the types of breeding species feeding frequency and environmental factors 3 when ec technology is applied in actual production the output current of ec should be adjusted continuously according to water quality characteristics of the sewage to ensure that pollutants are removed with minimum energy consumption and avoid secondary pollution caused by excessive metal ions in the present study an electrocoagulation diameter increasing reactor and microscreen drum filter edir mdf linkage control system was constructed in the ras of l vannamei based on changes in tss concentration c tss in aquaculture water the output current of edir i edir was feedback controlled by the backwashing interval period of mdf t mdf in ras t mdf shortens with the increase in tss concentration in aquaculture water 6 a shorter t mdf signifies a decrease in water quality of the ras thus it is necessary to increase i edir to obtain more flocculants and enhance the treatment efficiency of subsequent filtration equipment of note i edir decreases with an increase in t mdf this study provides a novel technical approach to improve the re of tss and optimize the water quality environment of ras 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental set up two devices were used in this study a laboratory scale edir mdf system fig 1a and a pilot scale ras of l vannamei fig 1b the laboratory scale edir mdf system was mainly composed of direct current dc power etm 3080 china programmable time relay ybd 4 24 china electrode plate reaction tank buffer tank and mdf the volumes of the reaction tank and buffer tank were about 10 0 l and 3 0 l respectively the inlet water flow was controlled using a liquid flow meter at 300 l h the hydraulic retention time hrt of the reaction tank was 2 min the dc power of edir was connected to the programmable time relay to create an alternating pulse current which could alleviate electrode passivation and improve current efficiency 16 the electrode plates with a gap of 2 0 cm were monopolar in parallel connection mp p 17 with five sets of anodes and five sets of cathodes moreover the electrode adopted iron fe plates with the length of 20 cm width of 5 cm and thickness of 0 3 cm and the total effective area of the electrode plate was about 0 16 m2 the filter area and pore size of mdf were 0 32 m2 and 260 mesh about 63 μm respectively the pilot scale ras for l vannamei consisted of an aquaculture pond ap edir buffer tank mdf water collection tank circulating pump moving bed biofilter mbbr foam separator fs and an ultraviolet lamp the total effective volume of ras was about 90 m3 in which the volume of ap edir buffer tank water collection tank mbbr and fs was 36 0 3 2 0 3 0 12 0 and 3 0 m3 respectively the ras contained two aps the flow rate of the circulating pump was set to 40 m3 h the edir inlet was connected with an ap return pipe and the influent flow of edir was 6 m3 h about 15 of aquaculture water in the buffer tank was treated using edir and contained large amounts of flocculants in edir there were five sets of anodes fe and five sets of cathodes fe and the arrangement was mp p moreover the gap and total effective area of the electrode with the length of 30 cm width of 25 cm and thickness of 0 3 cm were 2 0 cm and 1 25 m2 respectively the filter area and pore size of mdf was 2 26 m2 and 260 mesh respectively the filling rate of mbbr was 50 and used a 64 hole circular polyethylene bio carrier with a diameter of 2 5 cm and a thickness of 0 4 cm before experiment the ras for l vannamei has been in operation for 2 years and thus the biofilm of mbbr was relatively mature the mdf level switch was used to control the mdf when the mdf level switch was turned on for the first time mdf rotated half a circle and when the mdf level switch was turned on for the second time the mdf underwent a full circle rotation and simultaneously performed backwashing in ras the time taken for mdf to undergo a full circle rotation and backwashing was 9 s the water consumption was about 8 l time and energy consumption was 0 02 kwh time energy consumption by the circulating pump mbbr fs and ultraviolet lamp was about 72 36 13 2 and 12 kwh d respectively 2 2 experimental design step 1 the effect of ec on the particle size of tss was investigated in the laboratory scale system the experiment water was collected from the ap of the ras for l vannamei the culture water salinity was about 15 the ph was 6 92 the dissolved oxygen was 6 93 7 25 mg l and the temperature was 26 8 c before the test a 50 mesh about 300 μm sieve silk was used to filter large ss in the culture water such as shrimp shells and residual feed the current density of the edir was 50 a m2 the influent and effluent of edir were collected to detect the particle size of tss step 2 the relationship between i edir and t mdf was established and the edir mdf linkage control system was constructed in l vannamei ras firstly the relationship between c tss of mdf influent and t mdf was studied in l vannamei ras without edir mdf linkage control system the experimental period was about 60 days the salinity of l vannamei ras was about 12 15 the ph was 6 52 7 45 the dissolved oxygen was 6 50 7 20 mg l the temperature was 25 8 27

machine was used in ras at a feeding frequency of 1 4 time h and feeding amount of 3 2 23 6 kg day 0th 60th day the c tss of mdf influent and its corresponding t mdf were recorded daily the detection process was as follows 7 00 8 00 am and 2 00 3 00 pm with 30 min as a detection cycle the mdf backwashing frequency was recorded in each detection cycle to calculate t mdf and the tss concentration in the mdf influent was detected every 5 min to obtain the average c tss a set of c tss and its corresponding t mdf could be obtained from one detection cycle a relationship model between t mdf and c tss was established based on the collected data secondly the relationship model between c tss and actual fe anode dissolution c fe ad by concentration was established in the laboratory scale edir mdf system different c tss ranges were obtained based on the change of mdf influent c tss in ras within 60 days the relationship between threshold points in different c tss ranges and c fe ad was investigated the basis of this relationship is that the re of tss by mdf increased by about 20 when edir was applied finally based on the relationship between t mdf and c tss c fe ad and c tss c fe ad and i edir 17 the relationship between t mdf and i edir was obtained based on the relationship between t mdf and i edir the linkage control system of edir and mdf was constructed in l vannamei ras the opening frequency of the mdf level switch which controlled the backwashing process was uploaded to the ras central control system to calculate the t mdf based on the t mdf the i edir was adjusted to realize the linkage control of the mdf and edir step 3 the performance of the edir mdf linkage control system in l vannamei ras was investigated edir with 3 h as a working cycle operated for 8 h daily the first 2 h of each working cycle were used to calculate the t mdf and edir was started in the 3rd h i edir was set based on t mdf ras salinity ph dissolved oxygen and temperature were 13 6 82 7 15 6 22 7 50 mg l and 26 2 27 5 c respectively the body length weight of shrimps before and after the experiment was about 6 0 cm 3 23 g and 9 0 cm 8 43 g respectively the initial and final shrimp density was 3 55 and 9 27 kg m3 1100 shrimps m3 the automatic bait throwing machine with feeding frequency of 1 4 time h was used and the feeding amount was 15 2 27 5 kg day 0th 60th day the experiment lasted for 21 days the edir mdf linkage control system was shut down in the 0th 7th days no ec stage and started up in the 8th 21st days ec stage the concentration of tss cod ammonia and nitrite in the effluent of ap mdf mbbr and fs and influent of mdf was measured daily edir effluent was replaced with mdf influent to facilitate calculation in addition the backwashing frequency of mdf and the dry weight of mdf residue before and after edir start up were recorded the edir voltage current and anode loss were recorded the application of the edir mdf linkage control system in ras was evaluated by water quality and energy consumption 2 3 analysis method the particle size distribution of tss was detected using a laser particle size distribution analyzer bettersize2000 china the concentrations of tss cod ammonia and nitrite were measured according to the standard methods of the american public health association 18 after the experiment the electrode was cleaned with distilled water and dried at 105 c then weighed using an analytical balance bsm220 3 china salinity ph temperature and dissolved oxygen were measured with a water quality analyzer ysi 556 usa removal efficiency re of the equipment for pollutants was calculated using eq 1 5 1 re c 1 c 2 c 1 100 where c 1 mg l is the initial concentration of pollutants and c 2 mg l is the concentration of pollutants after treatment the theoretical fe anode dissolution m fe td g was calculated using eq 2 17 2 m fe td i edir t m fe nf where i edir t m fe n and f represent current a ec reaction time s molecular weight 55 85 g mol electron involved n 3 and faraday s constant 96 485c mol respectively current efficiency φ is the ratio of the actual fe anode dissolution m fe ad g to the theoretical fe anode dissolution m fe td g which was calculated using eq 3 16 3 φ m fe ad m fe td 100 energy consumption w kwh of ec was calculated using eq 4 5 4 w uit where u i and t represent the voltage v current a and operating time h of the equipment 3 results and discussion 3 1 effects of ec on the particle size of tss accumulation of small particle size ss 25 μm in ras decreases water quality 19 therefore it is important to develop a simple and easy method for removing fine solids from ras water results shown in fig 2 indicated that ec increased the particle size of tss in aquaculture water notably d10 d50 and d90 of tss in the influent and effluent of edir were 44 44 and 57 25 μm 129 70 and 241 80 μm 297 50 and 484 60 μm respectively application of edir increased the d10 d50 and d90 of tss in aquaculture water by 28 83 86 43 and 62 89 respectively moreover the proportions of suspended solid particle size 75 μm were 23 39 and 14 33 before and after treatment with edir translating to a reduction of about 9 06 the most commonly used mdf mesh size in ras is 75 μm 200 mesh 6 therefore applying ec technology to ras can improve the ability of mdf to remove tss and reduce the deposition of small particle size ss in ras 3 2 construction of the edir mdf linkage control system in ras of l vannamei 3 2 1 relationship between t mdf and c tss of mdf influent t mdf and c tss of mdf influent in ras were measured for 60 days and 231 sets of c tss and its corresponding t mdf were obtained regression analysis of t mdf and c tss was conducted based on the power function relationship between t mdf and c tss of the mdf influent fig 3 the relationship between t mdf and c tss was presented by the formulae c tss 23166t mdf 1 262 r 2 0 9107 3 2 2 relationship between c tss and c fe ad based on changes in c tss of the mdf influent within 60 days seven c tss ranges 0 6 6 12 12 18 18 24 24 30 30 36 and 36 42 mg l were obtained from which seven thresholds 6 12 18 24 30 36 and 42 mg l were selected in the laboratory scale edir mdf system the i edir and c fe ad corresponding to thresholds of different c tss ranges when the tss removal of mdf was increased by 20 by edir are shown in table 1 results shown in table 1 indicate that the re of tss by edir mdf system at a current of 0 a was 50 35 58 67 when edir was turned on the re of tss by mdf increased by 18 41 22 22 interestingly c fe ad was higher than c fe td and φ exceeded 100 with an average of 123 and a maximum of 130 the aquaculture water was rich in chloride ions which produced pitting corrosion on the surface of fe anode and increased the dissolution of the anode resulting in more m fe ad than m fe td 16 zodi et al 20 used an electrocoagulation flotation process to treat dye wastewater and found that average φ was 158 regression analysis of c tss and c fe ad was conducted based on the power function relationship between c tss and c fe ad fig 4 the relationship between c tss and c fe ad was fitted as c fe ad 0 0268c tss 0 321 r 2 0 9813 3 2 3 relationship between t mdf and i edir the relationship between t mdf and i edir was determined using the following four formula conversion c tss 23166 t mdf 1 262 5 c fe ad 0 0268 c tss 0 321 6 m fe

ras within t mdf in ras with edir mdf linkage control system the c fe ad in mdf influent was calculated using formula 8 q l s was the flow rate of the circulating pump in ras after calculation the relationship between t mdf and i edir was obtained eq 9 9 i edir 3217 69 t mdf 1 262 1 66 q φ 3 3 application of the edir mdf linkage control system in l vannamei ras 3 3 1 effects of the edir mdf linkage control system on tss in ras during the operation of ras failure to remove some tss with small particle size results in accumulation of tss 6 chen et al 21 used an elzone model 180xy particle counter to study particle size distribution of tss in the rass under different water treatment processes they found that the proportion of tss 20 μm in the high density ras was 47 an increase in tss concentration may decrease water quality and increase oxygen consumption in the ras as well as the number of pathogenic bacteria all which will threatening the health of cultured organisms 6 previously it was reported that edir can increase the particle size of tss through electro neutralization and flocculation thereby improve the re of mdf for tss 5 ec can also affect the treatment efficiency of biofilters and flotation equipment 22 the removal of tss by each water treatment unit in ras equipped with an edir mdf linkage control system is shown in fig 5 results presented in the figure indicate that in no ec stage 0th 7th day the average concentration of tss in ap mdf mbbr and fs effluent was 22 86 1 81 11 14 0 83 13 57 0 90 and 8 86 0 64 mg l respectively in ec stage 8th 21st day the average concentration of tss in ap mdf mbbr fs effluent and mdf influent was 30 64 2 52 6 36 1 05 8 43 1 29 4 50 1 34 and 33 93 2 96 mg l respectively under the action of the edir mdf linkage control system the tss concentration in mdf mbbr and fs effluent decreased remarkably interestingly the concentration of tss decreased after aquaculture water was treated using mdf and fs but increased after treatment with edir and mbbr edir can increase the particle size of tss through electro neutralization and flocculation improving the re of mdf for tss 5 previous study has found that ec can also affect the treatment efficiency of biofilters and flotation equipment 22 the removal of tss by each water treatment unit in ras equipped with an edir mdf linkage control system is shown in fig 5 from the figure in no ec stage 0th 7th day the average concentration of tss in ap mdf mbbr and fs effluent was 22 86 1 81 11 14 0 83 13 57 0 90 and 8 86 0 64 mg l respectively in ec stage 8th 21st day the average concentration of tss in ap mdf mbbr fs effluent and mdf influent was 30 64 2 52 6 36 1 05 8 43 1 29 4 50 1 34 and 33 93 2 96 mg l respectively under the action of the edir mdf linkage control system the tss concentration in mdf mbbr and fs effluent decreased remarkably interestingly the concentration of tss decreased after aquaculture water was treated using mdf and fs but increased after treatment with edir and mbbr specifically compared with tss concentration in ap effluent tss concentration in mdf influent increased by 2 4 mg l under the action of edir this is due to dissolution of the fe anode during ec to form flocculants which adsorb dissolved pollutants in aquaculture wastewater thereby increasing tss concentration 10 17 notably we found that the average re of tss by mdf was 51 27 and 79 24 in the no ec stage and ec stage respectively when edir mdf linkage control system was applied the re of mdf increased by 27 97 garcía morales et al 13 found that ec enhanced the removal of tss when used to treat chocolate processing wastewater before filtration this method also reduced turbidity by 95 another study found that the combination of ec and ultrafiltration technology removed 85 of tss in poultry processing wastewater and ec suppressed fouling on the membrane of ultrafiltration equipment and enhanced the re of ultrafiltration equipment for tss 23 moreover the average concentration of tss in mbbr effluent increased by 2 43 and 2 07 mg l in the no ec stage and ec stage respectively compared to the tss concentration in mbbr influent mdf effluent this is because the biofilm on the bio carriers ages and is replaced during the operation of mbbr and the shed biofilm increases tss concentration in mbbr effluent 24 of note under the effect of edir tss concentration in mbbr effluent was reduced by 14 57 this could be explained by the following two reasons 1 the flocculants improved adsorption and interception of tss by mbbr 2 the iron based flocculants changed the structure of the biofilm making it compact and difficult to fall off 25 26 chakraborty et al 27 applied electrocoagulation and sequencing batch reactor ec sbr technology to treat a mixture of municipal sewage and landfill leachate and found that the re of tss by sbr was increased by 21 under the action of ec in the ec stage the removal of tss by fs was reduced which was mainly due to the reduction of tss load in fs influent by 36 26 therefore under the effect of the edir mdf linkage control system the fs scale can be adjusted appropriately to reduce operation and construction costs overall the average re of tss in ras was 61 24 and 85 31 in the no ec stage and ec stage respectively application of edir mdf linkage control system increased the re of ras for tss by 24 07 an increase in re of tss in ras improves the water quality 6 the impact of edir mdf linkage control system on the aquaculture water of ap is shown in fig 6 in the no ec stage 7th day the aquaculture water was turbid and pale yellow with foam floating on the surface however under the action of the edir mdf linkage control system the aquaculture water became clearer and foam free 11th day 3 3 2 effects of the edir mdf linkage control system on cod in ras effective removal of cod also guarantees stable operation of ras 6 the effects of the edir mdf linkage control system on cod concentration in ras are shown in fig 7 in the no ec stage 0th 7th day the average concentration of cod in ap mdf mbbr and fs effluent was 9 16 0 69 6 10 0 33 4 78 0 14 and 4 50 0 11 mg l respectively the average re of cod by mdf mbbr and fs was 33 41 14 41 and 3 06 respectively in the ec stage 8th 21st day the average concentration of cod in ap mdf mbbr fs effluent and mdf influent was 12 97 1 38 7 08 0 47 4 26 0 17 3 22 0 33 and 12 84 1 36 mg l respectively the average re of cod by edir mdf mbbr and fs was 0 97 44 19 21 60 and 7 89 respectively the re of mdf mbbr and fs for cod was significantly increased when edir was applied during ec when the anode is oxidized and dissolved a series of side reactions occur these reactions produce active oxidation substances such as free chlorine and active oxygen which can degrade cod 12 xu et al 5 found that when fe electrode was used as the anode the current was 1 23 a the influent flow was 67 l h and the treatment time was 4 5 min the ec reactor could remove 22 97 0 30 of cod in mariculture tailwater the initial concentration of cod was 12 44 mg l edir can remove cod by electro oxidation and the re is closely related to the current and influent flow 20 in this experiment the re of edir for cod was only 0 97 0 21 which was attributed to the large influent flow notably the edir mdf linkage control system removed 45 16 of the cod in the ap effluent after opening edir the average re of mdf for cod increased by 10 92 this is because tss contains a large amount of cod 6 ec increased the re of mdf for tss by releasing flocculants which increased the re of mdf for cod mostafazadeh et al 28 used a combination of ec and ultrafiltration technology to treat laundry wastewater and found that when the current was 400 a m2 an fe electrode was used as the anode the filtration pore diameter was 0 02 μm and the hrt was 45 min the re of system for cod was over 80 and the re of cod by the ultrafiltration equipment increased by about 30 under the action of ec xu et al 5 removed cod from mariculture tailwater using ec mdf technology and the results showed that when the current density was 19 22 a m2 an fe electrode was used as the anode the filtration pore diameter was 63 μm and the hrt was 4 5 min the re of ec mdf system for cod was about 37 and the re of mdf increased by about 9 8 under the action of ec the ec technology can improve the cod removal of biological treatment and flotation 22 29 the average amount of cod removed by mbbr was 1 32 0 19 and 2 82 0 47 mg l in the no ec stage and the ec stage respectively under the effect of the edir the removal capacity of cod by mbbr increased by 114 this could be explained as follows 1 ec increased the adsorption and retention capacity of mbbr for tss which contained cod 2 ec improved the bio degradability of aquaculture water 30 3 the fe ion produced by ec improved the activity of microorganisms in mbbr increasing its treatment efficiency for cod 25 26 using ec sbr water treatment technology to purify a mixture of municipal sewage and landfill leachate chakraborty et al 27 found that the re of cod by sbr was increased by 33 under the action of ec the study also found that edir enhanced the re of fs for cod the average amount of cod removed by fs was 0 23 and 1 04 mg l in the no ec stage and the ec stage respectively under edir action the re of fs for cod increased by 352 fs can remove cod by separating dissolved and suspended organic matter 6 sokolov et al 31 found that cationic flocculants could improve the removal of cod in the flotation process another study found that iron based flocculants produced by ec adsorbed tiny ss and dissolved pollutants in the laundry wastewater to form flocs the flocs were brought to the surface of the water by microbubbles thereby improving the re of the flotation process for pollutants 29 overall the average re of ras for cod was 50 87 and 75 17 in the no ec stage and the ec stage respectively the edir mdf linkage control system improved the re of ras for cod by 24 30 3 3 3 effect of the edir mdf linkage control system on ammonia and nitrite in ras ammonia and nitrite produced in the ras pose a health threat to organisms 5 therefore successful breeding requires that ammonia and nitrite are removed from the ras 6 the influence of edir mdf linkage control system on ammonia and nitrite concentration in ras is shown in fig 8 in the no ec stage the average concentration of ammonia and nitrite in ap mbbr and fs effluent was 0 55 0 04 and 0 054 0 005 mg l 0 43 0 04 and 0 036 0 005 mg l and 0 40 0 04 and 0 036 0 005 mg l respectively the average re of ammonia and nitrite by mbbr and fs was 22 14 2 16 and 32 82 4 87 and 5 13 1 50 and 1 13 1 92 respectively in the ec stage the average concentration of ammonia and nitrite in ap mbbr and fs effluent and mdf influent was 0 58 0 07 and 0 072 0 006 mg l 0 40 0 06 and 0 048 0 003 mg l 0 37 0 06 and 0 047 0 003 mg l and 0 57 0 07 and 0 073 0 006 mg l respectively the average re of ammonia and nitrite by edir mbbr and fs was 1 86 0 78 and 0 74 0 88 28 07 4 80 and 33 40 6 75 and 6 07 1 65 and 1 76 1 87 respectively these results showed that treatment with edir decreased the concentration of ammonia in the aquaculture water and increased the concentration of nitrite slightly edir degraded ammonia and nitrite through active oxidizing substances produced by the electrooxidation process the ammonia was firstly oxidized to nitrite which was in turn oxidized to nitrate 5 due to the large influent flow active oxidants produced by edir in the present experiment were insufficient to completely convert ammonia into nitrate increasing nitrite concentration xu et al 5 used ec technology to treat mariculture tailwater and found that when fe electrode was used as the anode the current was 1 23 a the influent flow was 67 l h and the treatment time was 4 5 min the re of ammonia and nitrite was 63 19 1 69 and 67 42 3 47 respectively in addition the study found that mbbr played a dominant role in the removal of ammonia and nitrite previous researches have shown that ras mainly relies on biotransformation to remove ammonia and nitrite 3 6 therefore improving the nitrification of mbbr may help to optimize the water environment in ras as shown in fig 7 after switching on the edir mdf linkage control system the removal of ammonia and nitrite by mbbr increased specifically the amount of ammonia and nitrite removed by mbbr was 0 12 and 0 018 mg l and 0 17 and 0 025 mg l in the no ec stage and ec stage respectively under the action of the edir mdf linkage control system the removal capacity of ammonia and nitrite by mbbr increased by 41 67 and 38 89 respectively previous studies reported that ec can improve the efficiency of the biological treatment process especially when fe electrode is used as the anode by promoting the activity of nitrifying bacteria 25 26 30 qian et al 32 found that fe3 can increase the number of nitrosomonas and nitrobacter in sbr and improve the re of ammonia nitrogen and nitrite nitrogen li et al 33 combined ec with submerged membrane bioreactor technology to treat sewage and found that the fe electrode could increase the activity of enzymes related to nitrification interestingly in the ec stage the re of fs for ammonia and nitrite increased this can be explained by the following two aspects 1 fe3 increased the nitrification of the exfoliated biofilm from mbbr in fs 2 the combined result of adsorption of the flocculants and flotation of fs overall the average re of ras for ammonia and nitrite in the no ec stage was 27 27 and 33 33 while that in the ec stage was 36 21 and 34 72 which increased by 8 94 and 1 39 respectively 3 3 4 changes in t mdf i edir and energy consumption during the experiment the changes in t mdf and i edir during the experiment are shown in fig 9 t mdf was 242 280 and 172 202 s in the no ec stage and the ec stage and the average t mdf was 262 and 189 s respectively with a difference of 73 s the change in t mdf was marked before and after the edir mdf linkage system was turned on specifically the t mdf on the 8th day was lower by 41 s compared to that on day 7 moreover i edir increased from 51 03 a to 58 86 a with a decrease in t mdf in the ec stage compared with conventional ras ras equipped with edir mdf linkage control consumes more energy mainly due to loss of electric energy and fe anode during edir operation and increased energy consumption of mdf due to edir the energy consumption of mdf edir and ras before and after the ec mdf linkage control system was turned on is shown in table 2 the backwashing frequency the water used for backwashing and the filter residue output dry weight of mdf on the 7th and 8th days were 357 and 430 time d 7 14 and 8 60 m3 14 16 0 24 and 16 35 0 51 g time respectively edir increased the backwashing frequency and filter residue output of mdf the filter residue output of mdf on the 8th day was 7030 50 g whereas that on the 7th day was 5055 12 g representing an increase of 1975 38 g when edir was applied on the 8th day the energy consumed during edir was 2 06 kwh d and the anode loss was 350 g d the power consumption and water consumption of mdf increased by 20 45 and 20 28 relative to the 7th day moreover the energy consumption in ras before 7th day and after 8th day ec was 140 34 and 143 86 kwh d respectively application of edir mdf linkage control system increased energy consumption in the ras by 2 51 in the ec stage the average consumption of electric energy and anode of edir was 2 38 kwh d 1 68 rmb d and 370 g d 2 22 rmb d respectively and the average energy consumption in the ras was 144 74 kwh d 101 21 rmb d although edir can improve the treatment efficiency of mdf mbbr and fs in ras it releases fe3 into aquaculture water which may affect the health of cultured organisms adhikari et al 34 investigated the effect of fe3 on macrobrachium rosenbergii and found that the average growth feed utilization and survival of this species decreased with an increase in fe3 concentration the basic growth parameters of l vannamei during the experiment are shown in table 3 before and after ec the survival rate daily growth rate and feed conversion ratio of l vannamei were 99 2 and 97 3 0 13 and 0 15 cm d 0 17 and 0 18 g d 1 11 and 1 08 respectively these results showed that the edir mdf linkage control system not only improved the water treatment efficiency of ras but also prevented excessive production of metal ions 4 conclusions ec increased the particle size of tss in aquaculture water and enhanced the efficiency of subsequent water treatment equipment when the aquaculture water was treated using ecir for 2 min with a current density of 50 a m2 and influent flow of 300 l h the d50 of tss increased from 129 70 μm to 241 80 μm representing an increase of 86 43 based on the established relationship equation i edir 3217 86t mdf 1 262 1 66 q φ where q l s was the flow of ras and φ was current efficiency an edir mdf linkage control system in the ras was constructed the i edir was feedback controlled using t mdf moreover edir improved the removal of tss by ras and enhanced the nitrification of ras it also increased the backwash frequency and filter residue output of mdf in addition under the action of edir the removal of ammonia and nitrite by mbbr increased by 41 67 and 38 89 respectively application of the edir mdf linkage control system increased the treatment efficiency of ras for tss cod ammonia and nitrite by 24 07 24 30 8 94 and 1 39 respectively for ras with a volume of 90 m3 circulating flow of 40 m3 h and culture density of 1100 shrimps with a body length of 6 0 9 0 cm per m3 the average energy consumption and anode loss of edir were 2 38 kwh d 1 68 rmb d and 370 g d 2 22 rmb d respectively declaration of competing interest the authors declared that they have no conflicts of
