to support the decision making process of protecting healthy waterbodies and restoring impaired ones data driven modeling is an efficient technique that can be used to support such efforts our objective was to determine if in stream concentrations of contaminants nutrients total phosphorus tp and total nitrogen tn total suspended solids tss dissolved oxygen do and fecal coliform bacteria fc can be predicted satisfactorily using machine learning ml algorithms based on publicly available datasets to achieve this objective we evaluated four modeling scenarios differing in terms of the required inputs i e publicly available datasets e g land use land cover antecedent conditions and additional in stream water quality observations e g ph and turbidity we implemented five ml algorithms support vector machines random forest rf extreme gradient boost xgb ensemble rf xgb and artificial neural network ann and demonstrated our modeling framework in an inland stream bullfrog creek located near tampa florida the results showed that while including additional water quality drivers improved overall model performance for all target constituents tp tn do and tss could still be predicted satisfactorily using only publicly available datasets nash sutcliffe efficiency nse 0 75 and percent bias pbias 10 whereas fc could not nse 0 49 and pbias 25 additionally antecedent conditions slightly improved predictions and reduced the predictive uncertainty particularly when paired with other water quality observations 6 9 increase in nse for fc and 2 7 for tp tn do and tss also comparable model performances of all water quality constituents in wet and dry seasons suggest minimal season dependence of the predictions 4 difference in nse and 10 difference in pbias our developed modeling framework is generic and can serve as a complementary tool for monitoring and predicting in stream water quality constituents graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords in stream water quality machine learning seasonality uncertainty quantification data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction elevated levels of in stream pollutants are linked to water quality degradation and pose a significant hazard to human life and biodiversity alnahit et al 2022 despite efforts in water quality restoration over the years 41 000 waterbodies and 482 000 km of streams and shorelines are impaired nationwide as of 2012 copeland 2012 johnson et al 2013 in 2022 50 years after the establishment of the clean water act in 1972 this number has increased to over 1 million kilometers 50 increase for impaired rivers alone kelderman et al 2022 consequently the average cost of developing and implementing total maximum daily loads tmdls can be as high as 4 3 billion year usepa 2001 water quality management and restoration projects require adequate and continuous data for load reduction calculations borah et al 2006 2019 mallya et al 2020 and efficient modeling tools for timely water quality assessments non point sources are the primary drivers of water quality degradation in many watersheds and modeling in stream pollution requires adequate assessments of these sources borah et al 2006 thus the inter linkage among environmental drivers such as watershed characteristics meteorological and water quality has been widely discussed in the literature cho et al 2016 fluke et al 2019 while interactions among waterbody pollutants follow different linear and non linear patterns constituting complexities in predictive modeling sufficient or unavailable data further complicates these complexities various combinations of environmental predictors have been employed in water quality modeling depending on data availability water quality constituents of concern and the scope of the study commonly used predictors include publicly available datasets such as streamflow land cover soil meteorological e g precipitation and air temperature topography and animal population which explain underlying physical chemical and biological processes for water quality constituents david and haggard 2011 sakizadeh 2016 water quality observations are used to calibrate and validate water quality models khatri et al 2020 sakizadeh 2016 unlike hydrological data that are often obtained continuously water quality observations are sparse due to the costs of monitoring and limited resources mallya et al 2020 this is particularly the case for constituents like bacteria the data are even sparser due to relatively more complex and expensive monitoring holcomb et al 2018 yu et al 2021 sparse datasets are some of the most significant challenges for modeling especially for data driven water quality modeling such as machine learning ml mallya et al 2020a also data quality comes into question high concentration samples are crucial for pollution control studies like tmdls and their absence or inadequacy in datasets introduces bias to the water quality model predictions park and engel 2015 furthermore while some studies have successfully predicted pollutants without using other water quality constituents abimbola et al 2020 2021 other studies have suggested that their exclusion can lead to biased results e g an overestimation reported by park and engel 2015 or underestimation found by abimbola et al 2021 antecedent conditions with time windows e g days have been used to represent initial conditions and studies have emphasized their importance in water quality modeling abimbola et al 2020 2021 kao et al 2020 adequate representation of in stream water quality in watersheds requires an in depth understanding of the underlying physical chemical and biological processes beven 2018 process based models like soil and water assessment tool swat neitsch et al 2011 and hydrological simulation program fortran hspf bicknell et al 2005 have been widely used in predicting water quality constituents at the watershed scale these models are generally complicated and computationally demanding particularly for large scale watersheds and probabilistic analyses they are also neither easy to implement use nor scalable in situations of limited data simple models such as load estimator loadest runkel et al 2004 web based load interpolation tool loadin park and engel 2015 spatially referenced regressions on watershed attributes sparrow schwarz et al 2006 and load duration curves zhang and quinn 2019 have been used to generate water quality data and augment existing observations these models are typically limited by many degrees of freedom and the assumption of linearity in predicting water quality constituent loads using loadest park and engel 2015 found significant bias in model predictions park and engel 2015 their finding corroborates the study of lee et al 2016 who suggested that regression based models can result in high systematic errors in conditions like heteroscedasticity of model residuals poor pollutant flow correlation and seasonality lee et al 2016 in addition to the disadvantages mentioned above these simple models do not account for pollution drivers e g suspended solids and turbidity and their underlying processes e g settling and resuspension these drivers and processes can be harnessed from data using statistical associations and dependencies in ml modeling wang et al 2021 over the last decade ml algorithms like ensemble ml eml and artificial neural networks ann have received attention in the area of water quality modeling abba et al 2020 al sulttani et al 2021 chen et al 2020 this upward trend in the application of ml methods can be attributed to their ability to model intrinsic relationships in environmental systems while being computationally efficient easy to use and easily automated abbas et al 2021 adams et al 2013 ml algorithms can be used in conjunction with feature subset selection and model interpretation techniques like shapely additive explanations shap and relief based algorithms rba to explain model outputs and quantify feature importance via a small number of water quality drivers bilali et al 2021 wang et al 2021 feature selection varies widely in the literature due to constraints like data availability spatiotemporal scale and scope of the study to the best of our knowledge there are no systematic investigations into the importance of individual predictor sets such as water quality drivers and antecedent conditions for watershed scale water quality modeling additionally model uncertainties associated with water quality predictions are rarely reported in ml based water quality modeling studies duan et al 2013 farnham and lall 2015 posing a challenge for risk based water quality management ahmadisharaf et al 2019 ahmadisharaf and benham 2020 mishra et al 2018 2019 thus it is crucial to evaluate the effectiveness and uncertainty of ml based modeling frameworks for in stream water quality predictions using publicly available datasets alongside additional factors like antecedent conditions and other water quality constituents the main objective of this study was to evaluate the performance of five ml algorithms support vector machines svm random forest rf extreme gradient boost xgb ensemble rf xgb and ann in predicting the in stream concentration of fecal coliform fc nutrients total phosphorus tp and total nitrogen tn total suspended solids tss and dissolved oxygen do at the watershed scale using publicly available datasets through our analyses we also aimed to 1 determine if incorporating additional water quality constituents and accounting for antecedent conditions assist in improving the prediction of the five constituents 2 investigate the role of seasonality on the predictive capability of ml models for the water quality constituents and 3 quantify the uncertainty of ml predictions in terms of the water quality constituents the model applicability was demonstrated on an inland stream bullfrog creek watershed tampa florida where the abovementioned constituents are the primary sources of impairments like many streams in florida and the u s 2 methodology the modeling framework fig 1 shows a sequence of steps including identification of critical drivers features or exploratory variables of in stream pollution in terms of the five water quality constituents collection of the data representing pertinent processes selection of the most important drivers as model features implementation of ml algorithms in each scenario and evaluation of modeling scenarios using a set of fit metrics subsequently seasonality and uncertainty analyses were conducted 2 1 exploratory data analyses and knowledge guided feature selection we conducted exploratory data analyses to investigate the relationships between the water quality constituents and their drivers here target refers to a water quality constituent predicted by the ml algorithms and feature is a variable that can explain the underlying physical chemical and biological processes of the target water quality constituent generally increasing model dimension number of features exponentially increases the number of observations required tripathi and govindaraju 2007 hence careful feature selection is essential to improve the model accuracy and robustness and minimize the introduction of random errors from weak features into the learning algorithm kuhn and johnson 2019 here we selected the most important or most informative features that can explain the maximum target variability for each target water constituent we employed filter and embedded feature selection methods spearman s rank order correlation tree based shapely additive explanations treeshap and relief based algorithms rbas to extract critical features driving in stream pollution from an initial set of 35 exploratory features these methods use monotonic rank value strongest monotonic association rrelieff regression based relief score presence of feature value difference in adjacent data instances and absolute shapely values mean absolute shap value in determining features with the highest importance we used spearman s correlation to prioritize the initial 35 features this correlation is non parametric and evaluates monotonic associations based on the rating of each variable and as a result linear and non linear statistical dependencies among the target and features were assessed one drawback is that spearman s ranking does not consider the dependencies between the target and features thus we also used rrelieff a relief based algorithm that does not assume independence among features and is generally robust to missing data instances kononenko 1994 high dimensionality eiras franco et al 2021 feature interactions urbanowicz et al 2018 and noise in data eiras franco et al 2021 urbanowicz et al 2018 in datasets lastly we used treeshap xgb shap a game theory based method suitable for capturing complex feature target relationships robust to outliers and provides interpretations for black box models like rf xgb and ann xgb shap has been used in previous water quality prediction studies and found to be a highly effective model explanation method e g li et al 2022 we repeated the aforementioned feature selection criteria spearman s correlation rrelieff and xgb shap for each target water quality constituent and obtained a set of the most important features to be employed in the models this multi method approach was taken to obtain a credible set of explanatory variables for water quality modeling 2 2 machine learning algorithms to identify the most suitable models for future water quality applications five ml algorithms svm rf xgb rf xgb and ann were selected and compared in this study svm and ann were chosen due to numerous applications in previous environmental modeling studies banadkooki et al 2020 elshorbagy et al 2005 while eml methods like rf and xgb are emerging algorithms in water quality applications li et al 2022 wang et al 2021 zounemat kermani et al 2021 these methods are known for their adaptability to non linear problems and remarkable modeling performance as is the case in water quality modeling alqahtani et al 2022 li et al 2022 sakizadeh 2016 in this study we selected different eml methods rf and xgb based on the literature li et al 2022 wang et al 2021 zounemat kermani et al 2021 and the training method employed rf utilizes parallel training where each base learner is built independently using equal weights in each leaf node and eventual averaging all tree outputs in the case of xgb the base learners are generated sequentially and a gradient is used from one learner to the others thereby updating the leaf weights in subsequent trees this way each new tree corrects the error from the former giving more precise training predictions although xgb is a stronger algorithm known for more precise training predictions over rf it requires careful parameter tuning and is sensitive to overfitting in noisy data conditions zounemat kermani et al 2021 the strength of xgb is an added advantage due reduction in error propagation when building subsequent base learners while overfitting occurs when the model memorizes random errors noise in the training data on the other hand rf is intrinsically robust to overfitting due to the random selection of inputs but generally requires higher computational time than xgb stocker et al 2022 zounemat kermani et al 2021 in an effort to minimize the limitations and leverage the strengths of individual algorithms we implemented rf xgb using voting regressor a sci kit learn package this approach was supported by zounemat kermani et al 2021 who suggested that combining multiple ml algorithms through model averaging can leverage the strengths of individual algorithms and improve generalization ability zounemat kermani et al 2021 2 3 performance evaluation metrics for machine learning models parameters of each selected ml algorithm were optimized and their predictive performances were evaluated employing multiple fit metrics is helpful in modeling studies as the strengths and limitations of individual measures can be leveraged ahmadisharaf et al 2019 here we used six metrics to evaluate the performance of the ml algorithms in terms of bias error and correlation the metrics included the adjusted coefficient of determination adj r2 nash sutcliffe efficiency nse nash and sutcliffe 1970 percent bias pbias root mean square error rmse observations standard deviation ratio rsr and kling gupta efficiency kge gupta et al 2009 based on these metrics the performance of each ml algorithm was ranked using suggested guidelines for accurate quantification in watershed modeling ahmadisharaf et al 2022 ahmadisharaf et al 2019 lamontagne et al 2020 moriasi et al 2015 in addition to these metrics we used generalization ability ga to ensure each model performed satisfactorily with the introduction of new data bilali et al 2021 a ga value of unity 1 indicates excellent model generalization ga 1 indicates overfitting while values less than one 1 indicates an underfitting bilali et al 2021 the term improvement in model performance in this study refers to a significant improvement recorded in one or more of the selected objective functions likewise the term best model used in each modeling scenario was selected based on larger adj r2 nse and kge and lower rsr and pbias hereafter excellent very good good and satisfactory are derived based on moriasi et al 2015 and ahmadisharaf et al 2019 we computed these metrics using hydrostats and hydroerr packages in python the reader is referred to the papers mentioned above for details of the selected evaluation matrices 2 4 training and testing of machine learning models the ml algorithms were evaluated using a cross validation cv technique with multiple repetitions typically five to assure valid prediction results due to the learning algorithm s stochastic nature i e samples are randomly split in each learning scenario although 5 fold cv i e using 80 of observation for training and the remaining 20 for testing is typically found suitable in many modeling practices we examined 3 4 and 7 fold cv train test ratios alongside the 5 fold for all the ml algorithms our rationale was that the ml model performance increases with data volume so the ratio of the training and hold out sets was kept constant across the learning scenarios for each target water quality constituent to ensure the impartial model and scenario comparison unfitted rf and xgb models were combined using an ensemble meta estimator voting regressor in scikit learn python library that averages the predictions of each estimator also since adjusting the model hyper parameter factors that regulate the learning process manually is inefficient due to numerous tunable functions table 1 we used levenberg marquardt and early stopping optimization techniques to perform an exhaustive search and determine the optimum value of the model hyperparameters levenberg marquardt technique a simple and robust function approximation method was used to optimize ann model performance while svm rf and xgb were optimized using grid search tuning technique and early stopping also due to the size of our data 234 for fc tn tp and do and 80 for tss the learning algorithms chosen in this study tended to overfit the observed data therefore to minimize the variance levenberg marquardt and early stopping optimization were used in the ann and tree based algorithms respectively while a step size of 0 001 yielded an optimal performance in the neural network increasing either iterations or neuron count above 20 did not improve the learning performance table 1 lists the primary hyper parameters and functions for all the ml algorithms 2 5 modeling scenarios modeling scenarios table 2 were designed such that each scenario represents the water quality processes and data requirement considerations in scenario 1 s1 we assessed only the following variables land use land cover lulc meteorological soil animal statistics etc whose data are publicly available throughout the u s in scenario 2 s2 we considered the role of antecedent conditions which can influence contaminant leaching water seepage and overland flow volume different representations of antecedent conditions have been incorporated in previous studies such as cumulative rain prior to a water quality observation antecedent dry days weighted antecedent rainfall or a combination of different factors in one variable abimbola et al 2020 dada and hamilton 2016 farnham and lall 2015 thus we evaluated cumulative rainfall over a range of periods one to 14 days antecedent dry days and different sets of three day weight adjusted prior to an observed water quality constituent as representations of the antecedent conditions these conditions can influence in stream pollutant dynamics accumulated pollutants on the land surface can be mobilized and conveyed during a rainfall event and subsequently transported to receiving waters via succeeding rainfall events wash off many antecedent rainfalls can pronounce the effect of rainfall on the day of observation due to increased soil moisture content decreased soil infiltration capacity due to saturation and increased surface runoff farnham and lall 2015 furthermore in scenario 3 s3 we evaluated the effect of incorporating additional water quality constituents e g ph and turbidity to represent in stream water quality processes like settling resuspension and die off regrowth without considering antecedent conditions since data on these additional water quality constituents may be proprietary limited or unavailable in many watersheds this scenario is applicable only when such data are available or resources exist to collect them through monitoring finally scenario 4 s4 combines scenarios s1 s3 representing a situation where all data mentioned above are available 2 6 uncertainty quantification the uncertainty of ml algorithms was quantified using a robust estimator of variance suggested by wahl 2004 and ahmadisharaf et al 2016 in this approach the uncertainty of each ml algorithm is presented in terms of a prediction interval around a hypothetical value of unity the overall methodological sequence includes an initial computation of prediction errors eq 1 exclusion of outliers from the prediction errors series estimation of the mean and standard deviation of the prediction errors and determination of the confidence band around the predicted values of each target water quality constituent eq 2 1 prediction error e log 10 y sim log 10 y obs 2 prediction interval band upper limit lower limit y sim 10 e mean 2 s e y sim 10 e mean 2 s e where e is the prediction error e mean and s e are the mean and standard deviation of the prediction error respectively and 2s e provides the 95 prediction interval the estimated prediction interval for each water quality constituent can be used as multipliers to achieve a range of predictions when using the ml models in other water quality modeling scenarios 2 7 seasonality analyses seasonal influence on prediction performance is essential mainly when profound seasonal trends are present in the observations high intensity and more frequent precipitations are prevalent in the wet season which increases the overland flow and transport of contaminants to the stream through wash off processes moriasi et al 2014 sigleo and frick 2003 in a dry season sporadic short and high intensity rainfall events are prevalent promoting the transport of contaminants to adjacent streams and tributaries here we developed the ml algorithms for wet and dry seasons following the methodology presented in sections 2 1 2 6 we then compared the performance of these algorithms to investigate whether the performance is season dependent 3 case study the study area is the freshwater segment of the bullfrog river watershed located in the southern region of hillsborough county tampa florida fig 2 the watershed covers a drainage area of 104 2 km2 corresponding to the hydrologic code unit huc031002060401 according to the u s geological survey classifications the climate in this watershed is humid subtropical where air temperatures range from daily lows of 8 c to as high as 34 c the watershed has a heterogeneous landscape with developed agriculture wetlands open waters barren land and forest land covers although historically the watershed was considered an agricultural watershed dominated by pasturelands over the years there has been substantial urban sprawl across the downstream which is the area closest to tampa metropolitan area urban is the dominant land cover in the watershed downstream while the upstream part is still predominantly agricultural pasture and cropland the soil is mainly composed of highly permeable soil with a blend of hydrologic soil groups a and a d the watershed is low lying average ground slope of 2 5 with an average water table depth of 0 to 1 45 m additional information on data sources and temporal coverage can be found in the supplementary information document table s1 4 results and discussion 4 1 statistical analyses and feature importance log transformations were applied to all target time series to remove skewness in the distributions and deemphasize outliers thereby improving statistical validity of the observations for our predictions descriptive statistics such as minimum maximum mean and quantiles of log transformed target constituents are shown in fig s3 additional analyses of the time series show that the distribution of rainfall five day antecedent rainfall cr5 fc do and tss had no significant trend from 1998 to 2016 conversely tp had a significant decreasing trend p value 0 whereas a slightly increasing trend was observed for tn p value 0 02 furthermore seventeen most important features were selected and implemented in the ml algorithms we examined the cumulative rainfall over a range of periods one to 14 days antecedent dry days and different sets of 3 day weight adjusted prior to an observed water quality constituent to represent the most crucial antecedent conditions in terms of each of the five water quality constituents our results showed that cr5 was more important than other antecedent condition features for all the water quality constituents subsequently we obtained a union feature set of the top 17 features after combining the results from features importance analyses of each target water quality constituent fig 3 shows that the final selection of most important features top 17 features was consistent across target variables except for the inclusion of forest area in predicting tn tp do and tss also meteorological variables were more significant for tn and do while the inclusion of additional water quality constituents scenarios s3 and s4 dominated in predicting fc tp and tss agricultural area combined pasture cropland and grassland forest area and human population were the most important factors in predicting fc tn and do while surface imperviousness was more important for tp and tss predictions similarly antecedent conditions were more important than rainfall for fc tp and tss further highlighting the importance of accounting for infiltration runoff effect and soil memory in watershed scale water quality predictions despite the low lying characteristic of the study watershed baseflow was not found to be an important feature and was excluded from the final feature set likewise animal population was excluded due to its relatively weaker importance than other features which can stem from significant temporal and spatial approximation in the data other excluded variables included soil moisture wind speed atmospheric pressure and vapor pressure deficit it is important to note that limiting factors can present unavoidable bias in our modeling framework such factors include but are not limited to insufficient temporal coverage for some features and inadequate information on others including septic tanks wildlife population animal grazing patterns proximity to the stream and fertilizer application 4 2 model performance in this section we evaluated the selected methods in terms of their overall effectiveness in predicting target water quality constituents for each modeling scenario fig 4 and fig 5 detail the performance of each model in terms of the five water quality constituents using the six model fit metrics while fig 6 reveals the average percent improvement from scenarios s1 to s4 the reader is referred to fig s1 for information on training performance and fig s2 for quantile quantile probability plots of observed and predicted values in all scenarios 4 2 1 fecal coliform fc we found that fc cannot be satisfactorily by solely using publicly available datasets nse 0 5 and pbias 24 5 in scenario s1 however the performance of ml algorithms improved from scenario s1 to s4 suggesting that satisfactorily prediction of this water quality constituent can only be achieved when additional water quality constituents turbidity tn tp water temperature do ph specific conductivity and tss are used along the publicly available datasets overall there was a 1 8 24 0 and 30 9 improvement in r2 in scenarios s2 s3 and s4 fig 6 pbias values averaged between 24 5 s1 and 15 5 s3 for most ml models while ann had the lowest pbias 13 4 in scenario s4 according to rsr values in fig 4a prediction errors decreased considerably from scenario s1 to s4 20 1 and 22 2 reduction in rsr for training and test phases respectively with rf xgb and ann having the lowest values in scenario s4 0 48 and 0 49 respectively in scenarios s1 and s2 error values were generally satisfactory 0 6 rsr 0 7 and good in scenarios s3 and s4 0 rsr 0 5 similarly ga values indicated good generalizability without significant overtraining across all the modeling scenarios 1 4 on average except for svr with an average ga of 2 6 fig 5 4 2 2 total nitrogen tn and total phosphorous tp tn and tp predictions were satisfactory and similar across the four modeling scenarios suggesting that these nutrients can be predicted satisfactorily by solely using the publicly available data nse 0 68 and 0 69 for tn and tp respectively the prediction accuracy however improved from scenario s1 to s2 with more improvement evident for tp nse 0 69 and 0 73 for tn and tp respectively in the test phases as shown in fig 6 fig 7b and fig 7c likewise prediction accuracy was significantly improved in scenario s3 17 0 for tp and 14 8 for tn and peaked in scenario s4 21 1 for tp and 18 5 for tn as observed for fc the performance improvement from scenario s3 to s4 was more prominent than that from scenario s1 to s2 suggesting that the influence of antecedent conditions was more significant when combined with additional water quality constituents turbidity water temperature dissolved oxygen ph specific conductivity and total suspended solids 4 2 3 dissolved oxygen do and total suspended solids tss the predictions of do and tss were very good r2 0 7 in all the modeling scenarios though there were no significant differences in the training accuracies of do and tss predictions for all the ml models pbias was greatly improved in scenario s4 particularly for tss 11 in do and 21 2 in tss fig 6 xgb and rf xgb slightly outperformed other models in the test phases of do predictions 4 2 4 fecal coliform fc total nitrogen tn total phosphorous tp dissolved oxygen do and total suspended solids tss while the rsr values of tn tp do and tss were minimal in all the modeling scenarios there was a notable decrease in rsr values in scenarios s3 and s4 from s1 average values of 17 4 in s3 and 18 6 in s4 fig 6 this decrease was more pronounced for fc tp do and tss than other target variables even though tp was better predicted than tn tn predictions had smaller rsr values than tp this can be due to a larger standard deviation of the tn observations furthermore the average pbias across all modeling scenarios were marginal in the testing phase with values of 8 7 5 5 2 2 and 8 4 for tn tp do and tss respectively a closer look at pbias variability across all the target constituents revealed a similar pattern as seen in the prediction uncertainty where fc tss and tn had the largest pbias for tn tp and do model overfitting reduced was as indicated by the decrease in ga value in scenarios s3 and s4 fig 7 decreasing ga value in the same experiment can be localized to a larger training error suggesting that the prediction improvement decrease in variance observed in these scenarios was more prominent in the test phase than the training phase conversely unity values of ga in all the modeling scenarios were observed for tss suggesting that tss predictions have more generalizability than all other constituents furthermore although svm had significant overfitting for fc tn and tp average ga 3 4 average values of ga were excellent in predicting tss ga 1 while do s prediction had a slight overfitting problem do ga 1 7 despite considerable effort to minimize variance in test predictions considerable overfitting was observed in the predicted results of the xgb model across all scenarios ga 2 7 for fc ga 3 7 for tn ga 2 6 for tp ga 2 for do and ga 1 3 for tss fig 5 on the other hand rf xgb presented the most generalizable predictions ga 1 2 for fc ga 2 for tn ga 1 5 for tp ga 1 9 for do and ga 1 for tss fig 5 across all modeling scenarios compared to rf ga 1 7 for fc ga 2 4 for tn ga 2 2 for tp ga 2 for do and ga 1 5 for tss fig 5 based on average ga values for fc tp tn do and tss across scenarios rf xgb provided a 36 and 22 4 reduction in model overfitting for xgb and rf xgb models respectively in conclusion among the five ml models ann and rf xgb had the lowest overfitting problems fig 5 4 3 importance of additional water quality constituents and antecedent conditions although the performance of each ml model somehow improved with the addition of antecedent conditions and water quality features overall the performance without their addition was satisfactory for all the constituents except for fc the model performance improved marginally 4 2 for fc 2 2 for tp and 1 2 for tn with the inclusion of antecedent conditions in scenario s2 consistent with previous studies that emphasized the association of water quality constituents like bacteria with prior rainstorm events due to sediment resuspension in the water column abimbola et al 2020 farnham and lall 2015 motamarri and boccelli 2012 furthermore the inclusion of water quality data in scenario s3 significantly improved the prediction accuracy 21 1 for fc 17 for tp and 14 8 for tn as observed in other water quality studies abimbola et al 2021 park and engel 2015 2014 horowitz et al 2001 also stated that limited water quality data could lead to imprecise waterbody pollutant predictions further alluding to the importance of water quality data in this study when additional water quality constituents were included in the ml predictions scenario s3 there was a 24 increase in adj r2 23 decrease in rsr and 42 decrease in pbias respectively compared to scenario s1 fig 6 similarly when antecedent conditions were considered alongside additional water quality constituents scenario s4 there was an additional 6 9 increase in adj r2 4 decrease in rsr and 6 9 decrease in pbias respectively from scenario s3 to s4 fig 6 compared to scenario s4 r2 and rsr only improved by 1 8 and 2 9 when antecedent conditions were considered and no additional water quality constituents were included scenario s2 similarly higher peaks in the fc time series were better captured in scenarios s3 and s4 as shown in fig 7a these findings suggest that the importance of antecedent conditions becomes more pronounced when used in conjunction with additional water quality constituents across all the four modeling scenarios the models were found to overestimate fc concentration values 800 cfu 100 ml and underestimate concentrations 1360 cfu 100 ml on average there was an underestimation bias across all the modeling scenarios due to the underestimation of high fc concentrations which was significantly reduced when additional water quality constituents and antecedent conditions were accounted for in scenarios s3 and s4 fig 7a underestimation of large fc concentrations could be due to the unbalanced observation dataset since concentrations 1320 cfu 100 ml cover only 29 of the entire observations nevertheless ga fluctuated across the modeling scenarios without a clear pattern suggesting that prediction generalization does not necessarily improve with the inclusion of additional water quality constituents alone but through the combination of additional water quality constituents with antecedent conditions similarly model performance for tn and tp fig 6 fig 7b and fig 7c showed improvements in scenarios s3 and s4 with the introduction of antecedent conditions and additional water quality constituents although to a lesser degree compared to fc suggesting that nutrients are less reliant on these factors than fc in scenario s3 fig 4c and fig 7c tn was less reliant on including additional water quality constituents than tp fig 4b and fig 7b the trend from scenario s1 to s4 for tn showed that pbias did not significantly decrease with the introduction of additional water quality constituents tn predictions had a slightly larger bias than tp do and tss in all the modeling scenarios training phases while fc had the largest pbias 7 3 in the training phase fig 4c fig 4d and fig 7e all evaluation criteria suggested that additional water quality constituents and antecedent conditions significantly improved the model performance for fc tp and tn however their influence in predicting do and tss was small 2 and 1 improvement in r2 for do and tss respectively thus using only publicly accessible datasets was sufficient to predict do and tss 4 4 seasonality of the water quality predictions predictive performances of water quality constituents were evaluated for wet may to october and dry november to april seasons across all the modeling scenarios table 3 shows that the average seasonal concentrations 1998 2016 were larger for fc and do during the dry season but smaller for tp tn and tss in this season almost identical model performances of all the water quality constituents during the wet and dry seasons suggested that the season dependency of our predictions was minimal 4 difference nevertheless seasonal model performances showed that fc and tn had greater seasonal disparity compared to other target water quality constituents fig 8 considering the fit metrics in scenarios s1 s4 tn and do were slightly better predicted during the wet season while fc tp and tss were slightly better predicted during the dry season also there was a clear seasonal differentiation for the nutrients for tp model performance was more profound in the dry season for three scenarios s2 s3 and s4 while superior performances were found for the wet season for tn this suggests that tn is greatly affected by season regardless of the modeling scenario the effects of meteorologic features rainfall cr5 air temperature and relative humidity were more substantial during the dry season i e leading to a better model performance however because there were no apparent differences in the seasonal importance of meteorological features for tp the superior performance during the wet season cannot be directly attributed to meteorologic features the superior predictive performance of all the water quality constituents in scenario s1 can be attributed to more profound importance of rainfall in this scenario from scenario s1 to s4 the importance of rainfall dampens with the subsequent introduction of antecedent conditions and water quality constituents and more prominently during the wet season for scenario s4 this can explain why prediction performance for all target constituents excluding tn was superior during the dry season for scenario s4 similarly although fc s concentration was higher during the dry season there was more underestimation of large fc concentrations during the wet season this provides an additional possible explanation for a poorer prediction performance during the dry season also tss and turbidity were notably prominent for improving fc tp and tss predictions scenarios s3 and s4 highlighting the role of sediment transport during the dry season this suggests that the effect of short intermittent rainfall events during the wet season are stronger drivers of these water quality constituents than more frequent and intense ones during the dry season 4 5 uncertainty quantification predictive uncertainties of the best ml models for each target constituent are presented in fig 9 the findings showed that fc and do predictions were the most and least uncertain respectively aside from do the predictions of water quality constituents were least uncertain for scenario s4 incorporating antecedent conditions and additional water quality constituents scenarios s2 s4 reduced the predictive uncertainty around predictions of all water quality constituents this reduction was most significant for fc and tss fig 9a corroborating the earlier evidence of accounting for water quality processes like bacteria resuspension that can be explained by water quality constituents like turbidity and tss although tp predictions were more uncertain than tn tn had a larger pbias on average 8 6 for tn 5 5 for tp nevertheless tp experienced greater improvements in pbias from scenario s1 to s4 alongside fc and tss fig 6 also while do and tss had outstanding performances adj r2 0 9 fig 9e and fig 9f predictive uncertainties were larger for tss this can be attributed to the relatively small observation dataset of tss about one third of the other water quality constituents the uncertainties can be attributed to learning optimization algorithm biases water quality measurements the approximation of features across time and space when the data were not available and inadequate features to capture specific watershed processes such as atmospheric deposition nitrification denitrification among others mallya et al 2020 since the uncertainty reported in this study depended on the existing data in our case study the reliability of extrapolating the findings to a similar study area low lying with similar land cover distribution depends on knowledge of watershed processes and data quality however our presented modeling framework is generic and applicable to modeling in stream water quality at the watershed scale 5 summary and conclusions this study demonstrated a ml based framework to predict five in stream water quality constituents tp tn tss and do at the watershed scale the framework used water quality drivers meteorologic hydrologic geomorphologic land cover and pedologic which represent pertinent physical chemical and biological processes and are publicly available throughout the us alongside antecedent conditions and other water quality constituents that explain physical processes ph and turbidity we evaluated the performance of five ml algorithms svm rf xgb rf xgb and ann using various fit metrics adj r2 nse pbias kge and ga explanatory variables representing water quality processes were identified using tree based shap relieff ranking and spearman rank order correlation feature analyses revealed that water quality constituents tss and turbidity were the most important drivers of fc tp and tss while antecedent conditions cr5 and meteorological factors like rainfall and air temperature were the most important for tn and do s predictions this finding in addition to the model performance generally revealed that 1 though including additional water quality drivers improved overall model performance for all target constituents tp tn do and tss could still be predicted satisfactorily using only publicly available datasets nash sutcliffe efficiency nse 0 75 and percent bias pbias 10 whereas fc could not nse 0 49 and pbias 25 2 water quality data and antecedent conditions are influential in improving the predictive performance capturing high concentrations and in reducing predictive uncertainties for all target water quality constituents fc tp tn do and tss despite these advantages they were generally not necessary in predicting tp tn do and tss adj r2 0 71 nse 0 69 kge 0 72 and pbias 10 in contrast they are a necessity to achieve satisfactorily prediction for fc adj r2 0 68 nse 0 68 kge 0 69 and pbias 14 3 and even better when used in conjunction with antecedent conditions adj r2 0 72 nse 0 7 kge 0 7 and pbias 13 4 the most remarkable model improvement was observed for fc followed by tp tn do and tss based on adj r2 and nse whereas with regards to pbias the most significant improvement was observed for fc tp and tss 3 prediction uncertainties decreased for all target constituents and most prominent for fc and tss and the smallest predictive uncertainty was found for do followed by tn tp tss and fc this showed that fc and do predictions were the most and least uncertain respectively 4 although there were disparities in the prediction performances of target water quality constituents during the wet and dry seasons these differences were only marginal 4 difference in the fit metrics and more pronounced for fc and tn also fc tp and tss had better predictions during the dry season while superior performances were obtained for tn and do during the wet season thus short sporadic dry season rainfall was more important in predicting fc tp and tss whereas longer and more frequent rainfall dominated in the predictions of tn and do 5 while all the examined ml algorithms performed adequately for all the target water quality constituents rf xgb and ann produced more accurate and generalizable outputs this study shed insights into important water quality drivers and pertinent processes using ml algorithms for predicting in stream water quality seasonality of these models and the predictive uncertainties the models can also serve as an alternative tool when process based models cannot be implemented this in turn can support water quality restoration projects like tmdls in the u s and more broadly water quality restoration efforts future research should focus on evaluating the prediction performance of other ml algorithms like recurrent and attention based neural networks as well as autoregressive algorithms for water quality predictions similarly evaluating other water quality constituents at different spatial scales and examining other watersheds with different spatiotemporal characteristics e g tidally influenced and predominantly urban or agricultural are potential research areas that

to support the decision making process of protecting healthy waterbodies and restoring impaired ones data driven modeling is an efficient technique that can be used to support such efforts our objective was to determine if in stream concentrations of contaminants nutrients total phosphorus tp and total nitrogen tn total suspended solids tss dissolved oxygen do and fecal coliform bacteria fc can be predicted satisfactorily using machine learning ml algorithms based on publicly available datasets to achieve this objective we evaluated four modeling scenarios differing in terms of the required inputs i e publicly available datasets e g land use land cover antecedent conditions and additional in stream water quality observations e g ph and turbidity we implemented five ml algorithms support vector machines random forest rf extreme gradient boost xgb ensemble rf xgb and artificial neural network ann and demonstrated our modeling framework in an inland stream bullfrog creek located near tampa florida the results showed that while including additional water quality drivers improved overall model performance for all target constituents tp tn do and tss could still be predicted satisfactorily using only publicly available datasets nash sutcliffe efficiency nse 0 75 and percent bias pbias 10 whereas fc could not nse 0 49 and pbias 25 additionally antecedent conditions slightly improved predictions and reduced the predictive uncertainty particularly when paired with other water quality observations 6 9 increase in nse for fc and 2 7 for tp tn do and tss also comparable model performances of all water quality constituents in wet and dry seasons suggest minimal season dependence of the predictions 4 difference in nse and 10 difference in pbias our developed modeling framework is generic and can serve as a complementary tool for monitoring and predicting in stream water quality constituents graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords in stream water quality machine learning seasonality uncertainty quantification data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction elevated levels of in stream pollutants are linked to water quality degradation and pose a significant hazard to human life and biodiversity alnahit et al 2022 despite efforts in water quality restoration over the years 41 000 waterbodies and 482 000 km of streams and shorelines are impaired nationwide as of 2012 copeland 2012 johnson et al 2013 in 2022 50 years after the establishment of the clean water act in 1972 this number has increased to over 1 million kilometers 50 increase for impaired rivers alone kelderman et al 2022 consequently the average cost of developing and implementing total maximum daily loads tmdls can be as high as 4 3 billion year usepa 2001 water quality management and restoration projects require adequate and continuous data for load reduction calculations borah et al 2006 2019 mallya et al 2020 and efficient modeling tools for timely water quality assessments non point sources are the primary drivers of water quality degradation in many watersheds and modeling in stream pollution requires adequate assessments of these sources borah et al 2006 thus the inter linkage among environmental drivers such as watershed characteristics meteorological and water quality has been widely discussed in the literature cho et al 2016 fluke et al 2019 while interactions among waterbody pollutants follow different linear and non linear patterns constituting complexities in predictive modeling sufficient or unavailable data further complicates these complexities various combinations of environmental predictors have been employed in water quality modeling depending on data availability water quality constituents of concern and the scope of the study commonly used predictors include publicly available datasets such as streamflow land cover soil meteorological e g precipitation and air temperature topography and animal population which explain underlying physical chemical and biological processes for water quality constituents david and haggard 2011 sakizadeh 2016 water quality observations are used to calibrate and validate water quality models khatri et al 2020 sakizadeh 2016 unlike hydrological data that are often obtained continuously water quality observations are sparse due to the costs of monitoring and limited resources mallya et al 2020 this is particularly the case for constituents like bacteria the data are even sparser due to relatively more complex and expensive monitoring holcomb et al 2018 yu et al 2021 sparse datasets are some of the most significant challenges for modeling especially for data driven water quality modeling such as machine learning ml mallya et al 2020a also data quality comes into question high concentration samples are crucial for pollution control studies like tmdls and their absence or inadequacy in datasets introduces bias to the water quality model predictions park and engel 2015 furthermore while some studies have successfully predicted pollutants without using other water quality constituents abimbola et al 2020 2021 other studies have suggested that their exclusion can lead to biased results e g an overestimation reported by park and engel 2015 or underestimation found by abimbola et al 2021 antecedent conditions with time windows e g days have been used to represent initial conditions and studies have emphasized their importance in water quality modeling abimbola et al 2020 2021 kao et al 2020 adequate representation of in stream water quality in watersheds requires an in depth understanding of the underlying physical chemical and biological processes beven 2018 process based models like soil and water assessment tool swat neitsch et al 2011 and hydrological simulation program fortran hspf bicknell et al 2005 have been widely used in predicting water quality constituents at the watershed scale these models are generally complicated and computationally demanding particularly for large scale watersheds and probabilistic analyses they are also neither easy to implement use nor scalable in situations of limited data simple models such as load estimator loadest runkel et al 2004 web based load interpolation tool loadin park and engel 2015 spatially referenced regressions on watershed attributes sparrow schwarz et al 2006 and load duration curves zhang and quinn 2019 have been used to generate water quality data and augment existing observations these models are typically limited by many degrees of freedom and the assumption of linearity in predicting water quality constituent loads using loadest park and engel 2015 found significant bias in model predictions park and engel 2015 their finding corroborates the study of lee et al 2016 who suggested that regression based models can result in high systematic errors in conditions like heteroscedasticity of model residuals poor pollutant flow correlation and seasonality lee et al 2016 in addition to the disadvantages mentioned above these simple models do not account for pollution drivers e g suspended solids and turbidity and their underlying processes e g settling and resuspension these drivers and processes can be harnessed from data using statistical associations and dependencies in ml modeling wang et al 2021 over the last decade ml algorithms like ensemble ml eml and artificial neural networks ann have received attention in the area of water quality modeling abba et al 2020 al sulttani et al 2021 chen et al 2020 this upward trend in the application of ml methods can be attributed to their ability to model intrinsic relationships in environmental systems while being computationally efficient easy to use and easily automated abbas et al 2021 adams et al 2013 ml algorithms can be used in conjunction with feature subset selection and model interpretation techniques like shapely additive explanations shap and relief based algorithms rba to explain model outputs and quantify feature importance via a small number of water quality drivers bilali et al 2021 wang et al 2021 feature selection varies widely in the literature due to constraints like data availability spatiotemporal scale and scope of the study to the best of our knowledge there are no systematic investigations into the importance of individual predictor sets such as water quality drivers and antecedent conditions for watershed scale water quality modeling additionally model uncertainties associated with water quality predictions are rarely reported in ml based water quality modeling studies duan et al 2013 farnham and lall 2015 posing a challenge for risk based water quality management ahmadisharaf et al 2019 ahmadisharaf and benham 2020 mishra et al 2018 2019 thus it is crucial to evaluate the effectiveness and uncertainty of ml based modeling frameworks for in stream water quality predictions using publicly available datasets alongside additional factors like antecedent conditions and other water quality constituents the main objective of this study was to evaluate the performance of five ml algorithms support vector machines svm random forest rf extreme gradient boost xgb ensemble rf xgb and ann in predicting the in stream concentration of fecal coliform fc nutrients total phosphorus tp and total nitrogen tn total suspended solids tss and dissolved oxygen do at the watershed scale using publicly available datasets through our analyses we also aimed to 1 determine if incorporating additional water quality constituents and accounting for antecedent conditions assist in improving the prediction of the five constituents 2 investigate the role of seasonality on the predictive capability of ml models for the water quality constituents and 3 quantify the uncertainty of ml predictions in terms of the water quality constituents the model applicability was demonstrated on an inland stream bullfrog creek watershed tampa florida where the abovementioned constituents are the primary sources of impairments like many streams in florida and the u s 2 methodology the modeling framework fig 1 shows a sequence of steps including identification of critical drivers features or exploratory variables of in stream pollution in terms of the five water quality constituents collection of the data representing pertinent processes selection of the most important drivers as model features implementation of ml algorithms in each scenario and evaluation of modeling scenarios using a set of fit metrics subsequently seasonality and uncertainty analyses were conducted 2 1 exploratory data analyses and knowledge guided feature selection we conducted exploratory data analyses to investigate the relationships between the water quality constituents and their drivers here target refers to a water quality constituent predicted by the ml algorithms and feature is a variable that can explain the underlying physical chemical and biological processes of the target water quality constituent generally increasing model dimension number of features exponentially increases the number of observations required tripathi and govindaraju 2007 hence careful feature selection is essential to improve the model accuracy and robustness and minimize the introduction of random errors from weak features into the learning algorithm kuhn and johnson 2019 here we selected the most important or most informative features that can explain the maximum target variability for each target water constituent we employed filter and embedded feature selection methods spearman s rank order correlation tree based shapely additive explanations treeshap and relief based algorithms rbas to extract critical features driving in stream pollution from an initial set of 35 exploratory features these methods use monotonic rank value strongest monotonic association rrelieff regression based relief score presence of feature value difference in adjacent data instances and absolute shapely values mean absolute shap value in determining features with the highest importance we used spearman s correlation to prioritize the initial 35 features this correlation is non parametric and evaluates monotonic associations based on the rating of each variable and as a result linear and non linear statistical dependencies among the target and features were assessed one drawback is that spearman s ranking does not consider the dependencies between the target and features thus we also used rrelieff a relief based algorithm that does not assume independence among features and is generally robust to missing data instances kononenko 1994 high dimensionality eiras franco et al 2021 feature interactions urbanowicz et al 2018 and noise in data eiras franco et al 2021 urbanowicz et al 2018 in datasets lastly we used treeshap xgb shap a game theory based method suitable for capturing complex feature target relationships robust to outliers and provides interpretations for black box models like rf xgb and ann xgb shap has been used in previous water quality prediction studies and found to be a highly effective model explanation method e g li et al 2022 we repeated the aforementioned feature selection criteria spearman s correlation rrelieff and xgb shap for each target water quality constituent and obtained a set of the most important features to be employed in the models this multi method approach was taken to obtain a credible set of explanatory variables for water quality modeling 2 2 machine learning algorithms to identify the most suitable models for future water quality applications five ml algorithms svm rf xgb rf xgb and ann were selected and compared in this study svm and ann were chosen due to numerous applications in previous environmental modeling studies banadkooki et al 2020 elshorbagy et al 2005 while eml methods like rf and xgb are emerging algorithms in water quality applications li et al 2022 wang et al 2021 zounemat kermani et al 2021 these methods are known for their adaptability to non linear problems and remarkable modeling performance as is the case in water quality modeling alqahtani et al 2022 li et al 2022 sakizadeh 2016 in this study we selected different eml methods rf and xgb based on the literature li et al 2022 wang et al 2021 zounemat kermani et al 2021 and the training method employed rf utilizes parallel training where each base learner is built independently using equal weights in each leaf node and eventual averaging all tree outputs in the case of xgb the base learners are generated sequentially and a gradient is used from one learner to the others thereby updating the leaf weights in subsequent trees this way each new tree corrects the error from the former giving more precise training predictions although xgb is a stronger algorithm known for more precise training predictions over rf it requires careful parameter tuning and is sensitive to overfitting in noisy data conditions zounemat kermani et al 2021 the strength of xgb is an added advantage due reduction in error propagation when building subsequent base learners while overfitting occurs when the model memorizes random errors noise in the training data on the other hand rf is intrinsically robust to overfitting due to the random selection of inputs but generally requires higher computational time than xgb stocker et al 2022 zounemat kermani et al 2021 in an effort to minimize the limitations and leverage the strengths of individual algorithms we implemented rf xgb using voting regressor a sci kit learn package this approach was supported by zounemat kermani et al 2021 who suggested that combining multiple ml algorithms through model averaging can leverage the strengths of individual algorithms and improve generalization ability zounemat kermani et al 2021 2 3 performance evaluation metrics for machine learning models parameters of each selected ml algorithm were optimized and their predictive performances were evaluated employing multiple fit metrics is helpful in modeling studies as the strengths and limitations of individual measures can be leveraged ahmadisharaf et al 2019 here we used six metrics to evaluate the performance of the ml algorithms in terms of bias error and correlation the metrics included the adjusted coefficient of determination adj r2 nash sutcliffe efficiency nse nash and sutcliffe 1970 percent bias pbias root mean square error rmse observations standard deviation ratio rsr and kling gupta efficiency kge gupta et al 2009 based on these metrics the performance of each ml algorithm was ranked using suggested guidelines for accurate quantification in watershed modeling ahmadisharaf et al 2022 ahmadisharaf et al 2019 lamontagne et al 2020 moriasi et al 2015 in addition to these metrics we used generalization ability ga to ensure each model performed satisfactorily with the introduction of new data bilali et al 2021 a ga value of unity 1 indicates excellent model generalization ga 1 indicates overfitting while values less than one 1 indicates an underfitting bilali et al 2021 the term improvement in model performance in this study refers to a significant improvement recorded in one or more of the selected objective functions likewise the term best model used in each modeling scenario was selected based on larger adj r2 nse and kge and lower rsr and pbias hereafter excellent very good good and satisfactory are derived based on moriasi et al 2015 and ahmadisharaf et al 2019 we computed these metrics using hydrostats and hydroerr packages in python the reader is referred to the papers mentioned above for details of the selected evaluation matrices 2 4 training and testing of machine learning models the ml algorithms were evaluated using a cross validation cv technique with multiple repetitions typically five to assure valid prediction results due to the learning algorithm s stochastic nature i e samples are randomly split in each learning scenario although 5 fold cv i e using 80 of observation for training and the remaining 20 for testing is typically found suitable in many modeling practices we examined 3 4 and 7 fold cv train test ratios alongside the 5 fold for all the ml algorithms our rationale was that the ml model performance increases with data volume so the ratio of the training and hold out sets was kept constant across the learning scenarios for each target water quality constituent to ensure the impartial model and scenario comparison unfitted rf and xgb models were combined using an ensemble meta estimator voting regressor in scikit learn python library that averages the predictions of each estimator also since adjusting the model hyper parameter factors that regulate the learning process manually is inefficient due to numerous tunable functions table 1 we used levenberg marquardt and early stopping optimization techniques to perform an exhaustive search and determine the optimum value of the model hyperparameters levenberg marquardt technique a simple and robust function approximation method was used to optimize ann model performance while svm rf and xgb were optimized using grid search tuning technique and early stopping also due to the size of our data 234 for fc tn tp and do and 80 for tss the learning algorithms chosen in this study tended to overfit the observed data therefore to minimize the variance levenberg marquardt and early stopping optimization were used in the ann and tree based algorithms respectively while a step size of 0 001 yielded an optimal performance in the neural network increasing either iterations or neuron count above 20 did not improve the learning performance table 1 lists the primary hyper parameters and functions for all the ml algorithms 2 5 modeling scenarios modeling scenarios table 2 were designed such that each scenario represents the water quality processes and data requirement considerations in scenario 1 s1 we assessed only the following variables land use land cover lulc meteorological soil animal statistics etc whose data are publicly available throughout the u s in scenario 2 s2 we considered the role of antecedent conditions which can influence contaminant leaching water seepage and overland flow volume different representations of antecedent conditions have been incorporated in previous studies such as cumulative rain prior to a water quality observation antecedent dry days weighted antecedent rainfall or a combination of different factors in one variable abimbola et al 2020 dada and hamilton 2016 farnham and lall 2015 thus we evaluated cumulative rainfall over a range of periods one to 14 days antecedent dry days and different sets of three day weight adjusted prior to an observed water quality constituent as representations of the antecedent conditions these conditions can influence in stream pollutant dynamics accumulated pollutants on the land surface can be mobilized and conveyed during a rainfall event and subsequently transported to receiving waters via succeeding rainfall events wash off many antecedent rainfalls can pronounce the effect of rainfall on the day of observation due to increased soil moisture content decreased soil infiltration capacity due to saturation and increased surface runoff farnham and lall 2015 furthermore in scenario 3 s3 we evaluated the effect of incorporating additional water quality constituents e g ph and turbidity to represent in stream water quality processes like settling resuspension and die off regrowth without considering antecedent conditions since data on these additional water quality constituents may be proprietary limited or unavailable in many watersheds this scenario is applicable only when such data are available or resources exist to collect them through monitoring finally scenario 4 s4 combines scenarios s1 s3 representing a situation where all data mentioned above are available 2 6 uncertainty quantification the uncertainty of ml algorithms was quantified using a robust estimator of variance suggested by wahl 2004 and ahmadisharaf et al 2016 in this approach the uncertainty of each ml algorithm is presented in terms of a prediction interval around a hypothetical value of unity the overall methodological sequence includes an initial computation of prediction errors eq 1 exclusion of outliers from the prediction errors series estimation of the mean and standard deviation of the prediction errors and determination of the confidence band around the predicted values of each target water quality constituent eq 2 1 prediction error e log 10 y sim log 10 y obs 2 prediction interval band upper limit lower limit y sim 10 e mean 2 s e y sim 10 e mean 2 s e where e is the prediction error e mean and s e are the mean and standard deviation of the prediction error respectively and 2s e provides the 95 prediction interval the estimated prediction interval for each water quality constituent can be used as multipliers to achieve a range of predictions when using the ml models in other water quality modeling scenarios 2 7 seasonality analyses seasonal influence on prediction performance is essential mainly when profound seasonal trends are present in the observations high intensity and more frequent precipitations are prevalent in the wet season which increases the overland flow and transport of contaminants to the stream through wash off processes moriasi et al 2014 sigleo and frick 2003 in a dry season sporadic short and high intensity rainfall events are prevalent promoting the transport of contaminants to adjacent streams and tributaries here we developed the ml algorithms for wet and dry seasons following the methodology presented in sections 2 1 2 6 we then compared the performance of these algorithms to investigate whether the performance is season dependent 3 case study the study area is the freshwater segment of the bullfrog river watershed located in the southern region of hillsborough county tampa florida fig 2 the watershed covers a drainage area of 104 2 km2 corresponding to the hydrologic code unit huc031002060401 according to the u s geological survey classifications the climate in this watershed is humid subtropical where air temperatures range from daily lows of 8 c to as high as 34 c the watershed has a heterogeneous landscape with developed agriculture wetlands open waters barren land and forest land covers although historically the watershed was considered an agricultural watershed dominated by pasturelands over the years there has been substantial urban sprawl across the downstream which is the area closest to tampa metropolitan area urban is the dominant land cover in the watershed downstream while the upstream part is still predominantly agricultural pasture and cropland the soil is mainly composed of highly permeable soil with a blend of hydrologic soil groups a and a d the watershed is low lying average ground slope of 2 5 with an average water table depth of 0 to 1 45 m additional information on data sources and temporal coverage can be found in the supplementary information document table s1 4 results and discussion 4 1 statistical analyses and feature importance log transformations were applied to all target time series to remove skewness in the distributions and deemphasize outliers thereby improving statistical validity of the observations for our predictions descriptive statistics such as minimum maximum mean and quantiles of log transformed target constituents are shown in fig s3 additional analyses of the time series show that the distribution of rainfall five day antecedent rainfall cr5 fc do and tss had no significant trend from 1998 to 2016 conversely tp had a significant decreasing trend p value 0 whereas a slightly increasing trend was observed for tn p value 0 02 furthermore seventeen most important features were selected and implemented in the ml algorithms we examined the cumulative rainfall over a range of periods one to 14 days antecedent dry days and different sets of 3 day weight adjusted prior to an observed water quality constituent to represent the most crucial antecedent conditions in terms of each of the five water quality constituents our results showed that cr5 was more important than other antecedent condition features for all the water quality constituents subsequently we obtained a union feature set of the top 17 features after combining the results from features importance analyses of each target water quality constituent fig 3 shows that the final selection of most important features top 17 features was consistent across target variables except for the inclusion of forest area in predicting tn tp do and tss also meteorological variables were more significant for tn and do while the inclusion of additional water quality constituents scenarios s3 and s4 dominated in predicting fc tp and tss agricultural area combined pasture cropland and grassland forest area and human population were the most important factors in predicting fc tn and do while surface imperviousness was more important for tp and tss predictions similarly antecedent conditions were more important than rainfall for fc tp and tss further highlighting the importance of accounting for infiltration runoff effect and soil memory in watershed scale water quality predictions despite the low lying characteristic of the study watershed baseflow was not found to be an important feature and was excluded from the final feature set likewise animal population was excluded due to its relatively weaker importance than other features which can stem from significant temporal and spatial approximation in the data other excluded variables included soil moisture wind speed atmospheric pressure and vapor pressure deficit it is important to note that limiting factors can present unavoidable bias in our modeling framework such factors include but are not limited to insufficient temporal coverage for some features and inadequate information on others including septic tanks wildlife population animal grazing patterns proximity to the stream and fertilizer application 4 2 model performance in this section we evaluated the selected methods in terms of their overall effectiveness in predicting target water quality constituents for each modeling scenario fig 4 and fig 5 detail the performance of each model in terms of the five water quality constituents using the six model fit metrics while fig 6 reveals the average percent improvement from scenarios s1 to s4 the reader is referred to fig s1 for information on training performance and fig s2 for quantile quantile probability plots of observed and predicted values in all scenarios 4 2 1 fecal coliform fc we found that fc cannot be satisfactorily by solely using publicly available datasets nse 0 5 and pbias 24 5 in scenario s1 however the performance of ml algorithms improved from scenario s1 to s4 suggesting that satisfactorily prediction of this water quality constituent can only be achieved when additional water quality constituents turbidity tn tp water temperature do ph specific conductivity and tss are used along the publicly available datasets overall there was a 1 8 24 0 and 30 9 improvement in r2 in scenarios s2 s3 and s4 fig 6 pbias values averaged between 24 5 s1 and 15 5 s3 for most ml models while ann had the lowest pbias 13 4 in scenario s4 according to rsr values in fig 4a prediction errors decreased considerably from scenario s1 to s4 20 1 and 22 2 reduction in rsr for training and test phases respectively with rf xgb and ann having the lowest values in scenario s4 0 48 and 0 49 respectively in scenarios s1 and s2 error values were generally satisfactory 0 6 rsr 0 7 and good in scenarios s3 and s4 0 rsr 0 5 similarly ga values indicated good generalizability without significant overtraining across all the modeling scenarios 1 4 on average except for svr with an average ga of 2 6 fig 5 4 2 2 total nitrogen tn and total phosphorous tp tn and tp predictions were satisfactory and similar across the four modeling scenarios suggesting that these nutrients can be predicted satisfactorily by solely using the publicly available data nse 0 68 and 0 69 for tn and tp respectively the prediction accuracy however improved from scenario s1 to s2 with more improvement evident for tp nse 0 69 and 0 73 for tn and tp respectively in the test phases as shown in fig 6 fig 7b and fig 7c likewise prediction accuracy was significantly improved in scenario s3 17 0 for tp and 14 8 for tn and peaked in scenario s4 21 1 for tp and 18 5 for tn as observed for fc the performance improvement from scenario s3 to s4 was more prominent than that from scenario s1 to s2 suggesting that the influence of antecedent conditions was more significant when combined with additional water quality constituents turbidity water temperature dissolved oxygen ph specific conductivity and total suspended solids 4 2 3 dissolved oxygen do and total suspended solids tss the predictions of do and tss were very good r2 0 7 in all the modeling scenarios though there were no significant differences in the training accuracies of do and tss predictions for all the ml models pbias was greatly improved in scenario s4 particularly for tss 11 in do and 21 2 in tss fig 6 xgb and rf xgb slightly outperformed other models in the test phases of do predictions 4 2 4 fecal coliform fc total nitrogen tn total phosphorous tp dissolved oxygen do and total suspended solids tss while the rsr values of tn tp do and tss were minimal in all the modeling scenarios there was a notable decrease in rsr values in scenarios s3 and s4 from s1 average values of 17 4 in s3 and 18 6 in s4 fig 6 this decrease was more pronounced for fc tp do and tss than other target variables even though tp was better predicted than tn tn predictions had smaller rsr values than tp this can be due to a larger standard deviation of the tn observations furthermore the average pbias across all modeling scenarios were marginal in the testing phase with values of 8 7 5 5 2 2 and 8 4 for tn tp do and tss respectively a closer look at pbias variability across all the target constituents revealed a similar pattern as seen in the prediction uncertainty where fc tss and tn had the largest pbias for tn tp and do model overfitting reduced was as indicated by the decrease in ga value in scenarios s3 and s4 fig 7 decreasing ga value in the same experiment can be localized to a larger training error suggesting that the prediction improvement decrease in variance observed in these scenarios was more prominent in the test phase than the training phase conversely unity values of ga in all the modeling scenarios were observed for tss suggesting that tss predictions have more generalizability than all other constituents furthermore although svm had significant overfitting for fc tn and tp average ga 3 4 average values of ga were excellent in predicting tss ga 1 while do s prediction had a slight overfitting problem do ga 1 7 despite considerable effort to minimize variance in test predictions considerable overfitting was observed in the predicted results of the xgb model across all scenarios ga 2 7 for fc ga 3 7 for tn ga 2 6 for tp ga 2 for do and ga 1 3 for tss fig 5 on the other hand rf xgb presented the most generalizable predictions ga 1 2 for fc ga 2 for tn ga 1 5 for tp ga 1 9 for do and ga 1 for tss fig 5 across all modeling scenarios compared to rf ga 1 7 for fc ga 2 4 for tn ga 2 2 for tp ga 2 for do and ga 1 5 for tss fig 5 based on average ga values for fc tp tn do and tss across scenarios rf xgb provided a 36 and 22 4 reduction in model overfitting for xgb and rf xgb models respectively in conclusion among the five ml models ann and rf xgb had the lowest overfitting problems fig 5 4 3 importance of additional water quality constituents and antecedent conditions although the performance of each ml model somehow improved with the addition of antecedent conditions and water quality features overall the performance without their addition was satisfactory for all the constituents except for fc the model performance improved marginally 4 2 for fc 2 2 for tp and 1 2 for tn with the inclusion of antecedent conditions in scenario s2 consistent with previous studies that emphasized the association of water quality constituents like bacteria with prior rainstorm events due to sediment resuspension in the water column abimbola et al 2020 farnham and lall 2015 motamarri and boccelli 2012 furthermore the inclusion of water quality data in scenario s3 significantly improved the prediction accuracy 21 1 for fc 17 for tp and 14 8 for tn as observed in other water quality studies abimbola et al 2021 park and engel 2015 2014 horowitz et al 2001 also stated that limited water quality data could lead to imprecise waterbody pollutant predictions further alluding to the importance of water quality data in this study when additional water quality constituents were included in the ml predictions scenario s3 there was a 24 increase in adj r2 23 decrease in rsr and 42 decrease in pbias respectively compared to scenario s1 fig 6 similarly when antecedent conditions were considered alongside additional water quality constituents scenario s4 there was an additional 6 9 increase in adj r2 4 decrease in rsr and 6 9 decrease in pbias respectively from scenario s3 to s4 fig 6 compared to scenario s4 r2 and rsr only improved by 1 8 and 2 9 when antecedent conditions were considered and no additional water quality constituents were included scenario s2 similarly higher peaks in the fc time series were better captured in scenarios s3 and s4 as shown in fig 7a these findings suggest that the importance of antecedent conditions becomes more pronounced when used in conjunction with additional water quality constituents across all the four modeling scenarios the models were found to overestimate fc concentration values 800 cfu 100 ml and underestimate concentrations 1360 cfu 100 ml on average there was an underestimation bias across all the modeling scenarios due to the underestimation of high fc concentrations which was significantly reduced when additional water quality constituents and antecedent conditions were accounted for in scenarios s3 and s4 fig 7a underestimation of large fc concentrations could be due to the unbalanced observation dataset since concentrations 1320 cfu 100 ml cover only 29 of the entire observations nevertheless ga fluctuated across the modeling scenarios without a clear pattern suggesting that prediction generalization does not necessarily improve with the inclusion of additional water quality constituents alone but through the combination of additional water quality constituents with antecedent conditions similarly model performance for tn and tp fig 6 fig 7b and fig 7c showed improvements in scenarios s3 and s4 with the introduction of antecedent conditions and additional water quality constituents although to a lesser degree compared to fc suggesting that nutrients are less reliant on these factors than fc in scenario s3 fig 4c and fig 7c tn was less reliant on including additional water quality constituents than tp fig 4b and fig 7b the trend from scenario s1 to s4 for tn showed that pbias did not significantly decrease with the introduction of additional water quality constituents tn predictions had a slightly larger bias than tp do and tss in all the modeling scenarios training phases while fc had the largest pbias 7 3 in the training phase fig 4c fig 4d and fig 7e all evaluation criteria suggested that additional water quality constituents and antecedent conditions significantly improved the model performance for fc tp and tn however their influence in predicting do and tss was small 2 and 1 improvement in r2 for do and tss respectively thus using only publicly accessible datasets was sufficient to predict do and tss 4 4 seasonality of the water quality predictions predictive performances of water quality constituents were evaluated for wet may to october and dry november to april seasons across all the modeling scenarios table 3 shows that the average seasonal concentrations 1998 2016 were larger for fc and do during the dry season but smaller for tp tn and tss in this season almost identical model performances of all the water quality constituents during the wet and dry seasons suggested that the season dependency of our predictions was minimal 4 difference nevertheless seasonal model performances showed that fc and tn had greater seasonal disparity compared to other target water quality constituents fig 8 considering the fit metrics in scenarios s1 s4 tn and do were slightly better predicted during the wet season while fc tp and tss were slightly better predicted during the dry season also there was a clear seasonal differentiation for the nutrients for tp model performance was more profound in the dry season for three scenarios s2 s3 and s4 while superior performances were found for the wet season for tn this suggests that tn is greatly affected by season regardless of the modeling scenario the effects of meteorologic features rainfall cr5 air temperature and relative humidity were more substantial during the dry season i e leading to a better model performance however because there were no apparent differences in the seasonal importance of meteorological features for tp the superior performance during the wet season cannot be directly attributed to meteorologic features the superior predictive performance of all the water quality constituents in scenario s1 can be attributed to more profound importance of rainfall in this scenario from scenario s1 to s4 the importance of rainfall dampens with the subsequent introduction of antecedent conditions and water quality constituents and more prominently during the wet season for scenario s4 this can explain why prediction performance for all target constituents excluding tn was superior during the dry season for scenario s4 similarly although fc s concentration was higher during the dry season there was more underestimation of large fc concentrations during the wet season this provides an additional possible explanation for a poorer prediction performance during the dry season also tss and turbidity were notably prominent for improving fc tp and tss predictions scenarios s3 and s4 highlighting the role of sediment transport during the dry season this suggests that the effect of short intermittent rainfall events during the wet season are stronger drivers of these water quality constituents than more frequent and intense ones during the dry season 4 5 uncertainty quantification predictive uncertainties of the best ml models for each target constituent are presented in fig 9 the findings showed that fc and do predictions were the most and least uncertain respectively aside from do the predictions of water quality constituents were least uncertain for scenario s4 incorporating antecedent conditions and additional water quality constituents scenarios s2 s4 reduced the predictive uncertainty around predictions of all water quality constituents this reduction was most significant for fc and tss fig 9a corroborating the earlier evidence of accounting for water quality processes like bacteria resuspension that can be explained by water quality constituents like turbidity and tss although tp predictions were more uncertain than tn tn had a larger pbias on average 8 6 for tn 5 5 for tp nevertheless tp experienced greater improvements in pbias from scenario s1 to s4 alongside fc and tss fig 6 also while do and tss had outstanding performances adj r2 0 9 fig 9e and fig 9f predictive uncertainties were larger for tss this can be attributed to the relatively small observation dataset of tss about one third of the other water quality constituents the uncertainties can be attributed to learning optimization algorithm biases water quality measurements the approximation of features across time and space when the data were not available and inadequate features to capture specific watershed processes such as atmospheric deposition nitrification denitrification among others mallya et al 2020 since the uncertainty reported in this study depended on the existing data in our case study the reliability of extrapolating the findings to a similar study area low lying with similar land cover distribution depends on knowledge of watershed processes and data quality however our presented modeling framework is generic and applicable to modeling in stream water quality at the watershed scale 5 summary and conclusions this study demonstrated a ml based framework to predict five in stream water quality constituents tp tn tss and do at the watershed scale the framework used water quality drivers meteorologic hydrologic geomorphologic land cover and pedologic which represent pertinent physical chemical and biological processes and are publicly available throughout the us alongside antecedent conditions and other water quality constituents that explain physical processes ph and turbidity we evaluated the performance of five ml algorithms svm rf xgb rf xgb and ann using various fit metrics adj r2 nse pbias kge and ga explanatory variables representing water quality processes were identified using tree based shap relieff ranking and spearman rank order correlation feature analyses revealed that water quality constituents tss and turbidity were the most important drivers of fc tp and tss while antecedent conditions cr5 and meteorological factors like rainfall and air temperature were the most important for tn and do s predictions this finding in addition to the model performance generally revealed that 1 though including additional water quality drivers improved overall model performance for all target constituents tp tn do and tss could still be predicted satisfactorily using only publicly available datasets nash sutcliffe efficiency nse 0 75 and percent bias pbias 10 whereas fc could not nse 0 49 and pbias 25 2 water quality data and antecedent conditions are influential in improving the predictive performance capturing high concentrations and in reducing predictive uncertainties for all target water quality constituents fc tp tn do and tss despite these advantages they were generally not necessary in predicting tp tn do and tss adj r2 0 71 nse 0 69 kge 0 72 and pbias 10 in contrast they are a necessity to achieve satisfactorily prediction for fc adj r2 0 68 nse 0 68 kge 0 69 and pbias 14 3 and even better when used in conjunction with antecedent conditions adj r2 0 72 nse 0 7 kge 0 7 and pbias 13 4 the most remarkable model improvement was observed for fc followed by tp tn do and tss based on adj r2 and nse whereas with regards to pbias the most significant improvement was observed for fc tp and tss 3 prediction uncertainties decreased for all target constituents and most prominent for fc and tss and the smallest predictive uncertainty was found for do followed by tn tp tss and fc this showed that fc and do predictions were the most and least uncertain respectively 4 although there were disparities in the prediction performances of target water quality constituents during the wet and dry seasons these differences were only marginal 4 difference in the fit metrics and more pronounced for fc and tn also fc tp and tss had better predictions during the dry season while superior performances were obtained for tn and do during the wet season thus short sporadic dry season rainfall was more important in predicting fc tp and tss whereas longer and more frequent rainfall dominated in the predictions of tn and do 5 while all the examined ml algorithms performed adequately for all the target water quality constituents rf xgb and ann produced more accurate and generalizable outputs this study shed insights into important water quality drivers and pertinent processes using ml algorithms for predicting in stream water quality seasonality of these models and the predictive uncertainties the models can also serve as an alternative tool when process based models cannot be implemented this in turn can support water quality restoration projects like tmdls in the u s and more broadly water quality restoration efforts future research should focus on evaluating the prediction performance of other ml algorithms like recurrent and attention based neural networks as well as autoregressive algorithms for water quality predictions similarly evaluating other water quality constituents at

1251,to guarantee proper protection from fecally transmitted pathogen infections drinking water wells should have a sufficiently large setback distance from potential sources of contamination e g a nearby river the aim of this study was to provide insight in regards to microbial contamination of groundwater under different flow velocities which can vary over time due to changes in river stage season or pumping rate the effects of these changes and how they affect removal parameters are not completely understood in this study field tracer tests were carried out in a sandy gravel aquifer near vienna austria to evaluate the ability of subsurface media to attenuate bacillus subtilis spores used as a surrogate for cryptosporidium and campylobacter the hydraulic gradient between injection and extraction was controlled by changing the pumping rate 1 10 l s of a pumping well at the test site building upon previously published work in which tracer tests with a 5 l s pumping rate were carried out attachment and detachment rate coefficients were determined using a hydrus 3d model and ranged from 0 12 to 0 76 and 0 0 0013 h 1 respectively setback distances were calculated based on the 60 day travel time as well as a quantitative microbial risk assessment qmra approach which showed similar results at this site around 700 m at the highest pumping rate removal rates λ in the field tests ranged from 0 2 to 0 3 log m with lower pumping rates leading to higher removal it was shown that scale must be taken into consideration when determining λ for the calculation of safe setback distances keywords riverbank filtration tracer test qmra safe setback distance cryptosporidium campylobacter 1 introduction waterborne disease outbreaks are still a major health issue worldwide beer et al 2015 beller 1997 rasmuson et al 2019 to reduce the risk of these outbreaks pre treatment steps such as riverbank filtration can be used to lower pathogen concentration ray et al 2002 sharma et al 2012 during subsurface flow the removal of pathogens is influenced by groundwater flow rate which can vary due to factors such as groundwater abstraction river stage seasonal changes city planning decisions such as stream rehabilitation and effects of climate change furthermore water level fluctuations can lead to higher concentrations of pathogens derx et al 2013 in many countries an adequate removal of pathogens is usually assumed when subsurface travel times are 60 days or more and setback distances for drinking water wells are often calculated on this basis schijven and hassanizadeh 2002 however in contrast to this 60 day time of travel tot approach the world health organization who has recommended that a quantitative microbial risk assessment qmra approach should be used for defining safe setback distances for drinking water production who 2011 2017 to be able to carry out a qmra reliable transport and removal parameters describing subsurface flow are needed to accurately quantify these parameters tracer tests should be carried out at the site of interest using surrogates that experience similar transport and removal as pathogenic microorganisms studies in columns show that faster flow rates can lead to less removal choi et al 2007 ryan and gschwend 1994 walshe et al 2010 and attachment and detachment rates have been shown to vary with decreasing pore velocity bradford et al 2006 hendry et al 1999 an explanation for this is that lower velocity leads to longer residence times which increase the probability of microbes to diffuse over the energy barrier as well as leading to lower hydrodynamic forces decreasing detachment sasidharan et al 2017 furthermore colloid filtration theory cft predicts that the attachment efficiency α is dependent on the single collector contact efficiency η0 which in turn depends on the flow velocity because it affects among other processes the particle deposition rate due to interception tufenkji and elimelech 2004 yao et al 1971 this shows that velocity is an important factor affecting bacterial removal in groundwater however most tracer tests in the field are carried out within natural i e unforced gradient flow conditions which makes it difficult to observe the effects of different flow rates on microbial removal directly deborde et al 1999 mallén et al 2005 pang et al 2005 comparing removal rates at different flow velocities is usually done by comparing tests in different aquifers and few tests have been carried out with varying flow rates at the same test site kvitsand et al 2015 pang 2009 therefore it is not well understood at the field scale if and how changes in flow velocity affect microbial removal and the parameters that govern it in order to compare setback distances at the various flow rates a qmra was carried out for cryptosporidium and campylobacter as well as calculations of the traditional 60 day tot both pathogens considered in this study are commonly found in human and animal waste and can cause gastrointestinal illnesses leading to severe and prolonged diarrhea which might pose significant health risks especially for vulnerable and immunocompromised patients hoogenboezem et al 2001 percival and williams 2013 teunis et al 2005 teunis et al 2002 who 2011 campylobacter are fecally borne bacteria that have led to numerous waterborne disease outbreaks in the past years even in developed countries craun 2012 guzman herrador et al 2015 cryptosporidium are protozoa usually present in the form of oocysts which resist degradation and are generally more persistent in the environment not unlike spores of b subtilis headd and bradford 2016 campylobacter is removed more readily as it is not spore or oocyst forming and therefore experiences more die off and inactivation processes whereby the organism either dies or is unable to infect schijven et al 2013 the groundwater flow rates in this study were controlled by changing the pumping rate of an abstraction well in the area where tracer tests were carried out using spores of bacillus subtilis these endospore forming bacteria are very persistent during transport and are therefore regarded as worst case scenario microbial tracers to study the removal of bacteria in the subsurface li et al 2018 pang et al 1998 setlow 1995 b subtilis 1 5 μm long is of similar size when compared to many important bacterial pathogens such as salmonella spp and campylobacter spp and is also used as a surrogate for cryptosporidium spp which is up to 7 μm long even though there are differences in size surface charge and hydrophobicity bradford et al 2016a emelko and huck 2004 cools et al 2003 chen et al 2010 this study builds upon a previous study by oudega et al 2021 by performing additional field tracer tests at different pumping rates which are modeled in hydrus 3d to attain reliable parameters for the assessment of alluvial aquifers furthermore this study adds a comparison of the 60 day tot versus the qmra approach for defining the setback distances from a drinking water well using cryptosporidium and campylobacter as reference pathogens 2 materials and methods 2 1 field site the study was carried out at the obere lobau test site located near the river danube in vienna austria and contains alluvial sediments of mostly gravel and sand d50 4 mm cu 38 4 the effective porosity of the material is 0 12 and the hydraulic conductivity is 7 5 10 3 m s the groundwater at the site is not in direct contact with danube river water due to the presence of a dam and contains little to no oxygen a near neutral ph and a high iron content a more extensive description of the study site sediment and groundwater characteristics is given in oudega et al 2021 the site contains an injection well p24 and a pumping well lb13 at a distance of 25 m which also serves as the sampling point fig 1 there are additional pumping wells north and south of the study site which together create a drawdown of hydraulic head and a predominantly west to east groundwater flow the injection well has a well screen from 8 to 14 m depth the pumping well has a well screen from 5 to 23 m depth and both well screens are located fully in the saturated zone 2 2 experimental design to allow for direct comparison of transport processes at different flow rates duplicate tracer tests were performed in a forced gradient system with pumping rates of 1 5 and 10 l s table 1 these pumping rates are about an order of magnitude lower than the maximum extraction rates in drinking water wells downstream of the study site however due to regulations higher pumping rates were not allowed the flow rates given in this table are averages over the transport distance but not uniform as they increase towards the pumping well all experiments were done with spores of b subtilis and a conservative tracer either uranine or bromide tests 5a b were done with bromide using a pumping rate of 5 l s results published in oudega et al 2021 the additional tests for this study were carried out with uranine tests 1a b with a 1 l s pumping rate and tests 10a b with a 10 l s pumping rate test 1pre was carried out with both bromide and uranine to check whether the transport behavior of the two conservative tracers was comparable to one another the absolute difference in gradient between duplicate experiments was never 2 8 2 3 characteristics culture and essay of the tracers 2 3 1 bacillus subtilis all tests were carried out with b subtilis endospores strain atcc 6633 which are rod shaped aerobic and non pathogenic bacteria present in low temperature environments harden and harris 1953 headd and bradford 2016 wightman et al 2001 in the spore state b subtilis bacteria are well protected against damage and survive for a long time setlow 1995 setlow and johnson 2019 using an electron microscope fei company hillsboro usa the spores were measured to be 1 5 μm in length and 0 5 μm in width they have an isoelectric point of ph 2 2 and are strongly hydrophilic bradford et al 2016b harden and harris 1953 preparation and assay was described in oudega et al 2021 the spores were injected in a concentration of approximately 109 spores ml the suspension of 1 5 l groundwater was injected in 1 5 min at 7 m depth by using a peristaltic pump samples of 12 ml were taken by an autosampler from a flow through cell linked to pumping well lb13 and stored in glass test tubes an initial interval of 5 min between samples was used in tests 5a b and 10a b and 60 min in tests 1a b these intervals were extended after the peaks passed depending on the expected concentration sample volumes of 1 2 3 6 or 9 ml were used on one or up to three petri dishes the lower the expected concentration the higher was the sample volume analyzed using the pour plating technique and pc agar merck darmstadt germany 2 3 2 bromide according to the maximum concentration of 100 mg l nabr permitted by the government the bromide 100 g was injected in a volume of 1000 l groundwater to ensure sufficient concentration in the samples the bromide solution was injected by fuel pump 2 min after the injection of the b subtilis spore suspension and took approximately 15 min we assumed no mixing between the two tracer solutions the samples were analyzed at the tu wien with hp lc chromatography metrohm eco ic herisau switzerland 2 3 3 uranine uranine was used in tests 1a b and 10a b in a concentration of 10 g l and a volume of 10 l groundwater using the same injection method as for bromide the fluorescence of the water was measured directly in the flow through cell using a ggun fl24 flow through field fluorospectrophotometer albillia co neuchatel switzerland 2 4 modeling 2 4 1 hydrus the field tests were modeled using hydrus 3d software šimůnek et al 2016 the three dimensional domain was defined as a cuboid with a depth of 24 m which is the top of a clayey aquitard in the study area constant heads were assigned to the domain boundaries upstream and downstream as well as on the main pumping well as to maintain perfect control over the hydraulic gradient fig 1 no flow conditions were assigned to the north and south boundaries on either side of the flow line except for two pumping wells on these boundaries which were modeled by constant discharge the values for hydraulic conductivity were found by calibration on the basis of the measured water levels in the piezometers during tests the injection solution was assumed to be mixed in the entire well screen calibration of dispersivity values was done by fitting the modeled breakthrough curves btcs of conservative tracers to the measured data more details about the model and its parameters can be found in oudega et al 2021 to calculate the model derived 60 day tot distances the modeled hydraulic gradient was extrapolated in space for each test darcy s equation was then employed using the calibrated values for hydraulic conductivity and porosity the subsurface flow was simulated in 3 dimensions with the richards equation simunek et al 2012 1 θ t x i k h k ij a h x j k iz a where θ is the water content t is time t xi is the spatial coordinate l k is the hydraulic conductivity l t h is the pressure head l and kij a are components of a dimensionless anisotropy tensor the transport of spores of b subtilis was modeled using the following advection dispersion equation and two site attachment detachment model schijven and šimůnek 2002 2 c t d x 2 c x 2 d y 2 c y 2 d z 2 c z 2 v c x ρ b θ δ s 1 δt ρ b θ δ s 2 δt 3 ρ b

water velocity l t whereby x is the direction of flow ρb is bulk density m l3 and s is the concentration of attached particles m l3 values for katt and kdet 1 t attachment and detachment rate coefficients respectively were found by calibrating the model to the btc of each test 2 4 2 qmraspot qmraspot is a computational tool to analyze and conduct a quantitative microbial risk assessment qmra for drinking water it was used for this study site to calculate the necessary removal of cryptosporidium oocysts and campylobacter during subsurface transport the model uses monte carlo simulations to calculate the risk of infection based on the distribution of the input data as well pathogen specific dose response parameters schijven et al 2011 this is done in order to reach a health based target which is the criterion to minimize the risk of infection below 10 4 person year based on recommendations by the who who 2011 to reach this target qmraspot was calibrated by trial and error for the necessary subsurface removal the input parameters for the program are given in table 2 the source concentrations of cryptosporidium and campylobacter were obtained from demeter et al 2021 who used a probabilistic deterministic water quality model of the danube which considered the major wastewater sources upstream of the study site this water quality model produced a mean and 95th percentile concentration for each pathogen from which the program created a distribution to run 10 000 monte carlo simulations resulting in a specific risk infections person year two separate inactivation rates were used for campylobacter because of large differences in the literature for cryptosporidium these differences were smaller and therefore of less influence on the resulting setback distances which is why only one value was used dose response curves for each pathogen are included in the program schijven et al 2011 teunis et al 2005 teunis et al 2002 2 5 analytical methods btcs for the conservative tracers and b subtilis were plotted as sample concentrations over time normalized by the initial concentration from this data spatial removal rates λ 1 l for b subtilis spores were calculated for each test as per eq 5 which is valid for three dimensions if the flow rate is constant kretzschmar et al 1997 pang 2009 5 λ ln q n 0 0 t f c t dt x 2 3 log 10 q n 0 0 t f c t dt x where q is the flow rate in the well l3 t n0 is the total amount of microbial tracer injected m c t the concentration at a given time t after injection m l3 tf is the final time of the test t and x the distance traveled to the pumping well l the integration was approximated by dividing the time series into sampling intervals of which it was assumed that the sample concentration was an average value for that time interval the setback distance for the qmra method was calculated by the 1d advection dispersion equation coupled with the removal λ and inactivation rate modified from blaschke et al 2016 6 x 2 3 2 α l log f 1 1 4 α l λ v μ v where f is calculated by qmraspot and is the necessary removal of cryptosporidium or campylobacter by subsurface transport as a fraction to meet the health based target αl is the longitudinal dispersivity l and μ is the inactivation rate 1 t as a comparison to the model derived 60 day tot described above the setback distance based on the austrian 60 day tot regulation was calculated by trial and error as per eq 7 övgw 2004 7 t 0 462 0 045 k f u x q u h gw 2 π ln 1 x u h gw 2 π q where kf is the hydraulic conductivity l t u is the darcy velocity l t and hgw is the height of the water column in the aquifer l 2 6 upscaling of λ in this study the values for λ were found for a distance of 25 m and may not be representative for larger transport distances as λ has been reported to decrease with an increase in travel distance hornstra et al 2018 kvitsand et al 2015 schijven and šimůnek 2002 explanations for this phenomenon include distance related straining processes reduction of the ionic strength of the input solution over time due to dilution blocking of favorable attachment sites and bacterial heterogeneity bradford et al 2007 pang 2009 camesano et al 1999 because the necessary setback distances are likely an order of magnitude larger than this distance the obtained values for λ from the experiments might yield setback distances that are too small which could lead to potential health hazards to solve this problem an upscaled λ was estimated using the literature comparison in oudega et al 2021 from which a relationship between travel distance and λ can be formulated fig 2 the relationship of y corresponding to λfield λcolumn and x corresponding to transport distance was then used to calculate the ratio of λfield λcolumn at larger transport distances because the value of λcolumn is known λfield can be calculated at a different transport distance because the relationship as found in fig 2 has no data points with a transport distance larger than 97 m harvey et al 2008 scaling beyond this point would be unreliable therefore a transport distance of 96 m was chosen as a characteristic length for upscaling λ since this relationship is merely a first step to understanding the upscaling relationship at different transport distances the resulting λ values have a very high uncertainty therefore the upscaling of λ is used here only to showcase how setback distances could change if tracer tests are performed at different distances highlighting the importance of reliably determining λ 3 results 3 1 comparison of bromide and uranine as conservative tracers to ascertain that direct comparisons were possible between bromide and uranine a test with both conservative tracers was carried out the results show that bromide and uranine behave similarly in terms of peak timing and change in concentration fig 3 note that bromide was injected in a 100 times larger volume than uranine hence the 2 log difference in c c0 this might also change flow properties such as dispersion between the tests leading to slightly differing results a further explanation of the differences between the two conservative tracers is that uranine might experience sorption to aquifer grains during subsurface flow dollinger et al 2017 as bromide does not experience sorption a higher concentration may be transported to the pumping well lastly the difference in sampling and measurement methods might cause differences between the btcs bromide was sampled by an autosampler while uranine was measured in the flow through cell with a fluorescence meter which is an advantage over sampling because of the high temporal resolution the recovery rates were 67 7 for bromide and 63 3 for uranine the similarities were considered sufficient to approve using uranine at this study site as a conservative tracer 3 2 bacillus subtilis spores breakthrough and model results in tests 1a b the b subtilis concentrations are in the range of the limit of quantification due to the low concentrations in the zed samples fig 4 1a and 1b at t 30 h b subtilis peaked earlier than the conservative tracer showing that pore size exclusion is an important process in the study area grindrod et al 1996 pang et al 2005 this in turn affects the dispersivity values in the model which were lower for b subtilis than for the conservative tracers table 3 this is because the microbial tracers travel predominantly through larger and better connected pores leading to a more advective and less dispersive transport than the conservative tracers pang et al 1998 the peak c c0 breakthrough was 4 2 10 9 showing a peak reduction of just under 9 log the very early breakthrough in test 1a was assumed to be contamination both tests exhibit significant tailing as well as breakthrough of higher concentrations after the initial peak has passed the high concentration in spore samples at t 60 h in both tests 1a and 1b in tests 5a b peak concentrations were around 4 times higher than in tests 1a b furthermore peak time was much earlier than the conservative tracer peak the reduction in peak concentration was approximately 8 logs the outliers were likely a product of sample contamination in tests 10a b btcs were less irregular than in the lower pumping rate tests which can be attributed to the higher concentrations in the analyzed samples concentrations peaked at approximately t 4 69 h with c c0 at 3 75 10 8 around 3 4 times higher than tests 5a b an overview of the tests is shown in table 3 with the removal rates for b subtilis as calculated per eq 5 and values for katt and kdet taken from the modeling study 4 discussion 4 1 hydrus 3d modeling the ratio of cmax c0 for b subtilis spores in the tracer tests was generally 10 8 10 9 compared to 10 3 for the conservative tracers table 3 this shows that removal processes are important for colloid transport in this area many studies have ascertained that no significant inactivation of b subtilis spores took place after time periods from 7 days up to 45 days greskowiak et al 2006 li et al 2018 pang et al 1998 pike et al 1969 ratcliffe 1995 and because the fraction of colloid size to median grain size 0 0003 in our experiments is smaller than 0 0017 straining should not occur bradford et al 2002 for these reasons the removal of b subtilis in this study was assumed to be governed by attachment two attachment and detachments rate coefficients were necessary to accurately model the tailing of the b subtilis btcs in this model katt1 mainly controls the height of the peak concentration while katt2 kdet1 and kdet2 mainly control the shape of the falling limb of the btc schijven et al 2001 table 3 shows the attachment and detachment rate coefficients that were found for each experiment the difference between attachment sites can be explained by microbial population heterogeneity i e certain b subtilis spores within the colloidal population are inherently more or less likely to attach to sorption sites due to differences in their surface structure or charge foppen and schijven 2006 schijven and hassanizadeh 2000 however the more widely accepted explanation is that physical heterogeneity is more important i e certain attachment sites are more likely to capture b subtilis spores than others this could depend on multiple factors for example the extent of the favorable attachment sites or their charge i e iron content ginn et al 2002 knapp et al 1998 schijven and šimůnek 2002 it was found that katt1 was lowest for the lowest flow rate tests 1 l s but in the middle and highest flow rate tests 5 and 10 l s respectively katt1 was similar other studies have also found an increase in attachment rate with pore water velocity v on both the column and field scale hendry et al 1999 hijnen et al 2005 schijven et al 2001 kdet1 katt2 and kdet2 were also found to increase with v this shows that the ratio of reversibly attached particles increases with v which affirms previous findings bradford et al 2016b more reversible attachment might be an important mechanism that causes removal to decrease with an increase in flow rate even though the attachment rate coefficients increased with flow rate overall removal decreased due to shorter residence times a pumping rate change from 1 to 10 l s decreased the removal rate λ by 30 table 3 this is supported by the literature on field tracer studies which generally states that an increase in flow rate decreases removal camesano and logan 1998 kvitsand et al 2015 pang 2009 which in this study ranges from 0 19 to 0 28 log m typically values for λ are in the range of 10 2 10 1 log m for sand and gravel aquifers but in gravel aquifers with a flow rate 11 m d can be as low as 10 3 log m pang 2009 the values for λ in this study are on the higher side of this range which might be due to the high amount of fine material present at this study s field site the d50 is 4 mm versus for example 18 mm at the burnham test site pang et al 2005 another explanation is that there could be differences in sphericity and or surface roughness of the material which can influence attachment saiers and ryan 2005 shellenberger and logan 2002 lastly the high iron content in the groundwater of our study site points to the presence of iron oxides which can function as attachment sites leading to enhanced microbial attachment ginn et al 2002 knapp et al 1998 4 2 setback distances the computations with qmraspot showed that to reach the health based target the necessary total subsurface removal was 5 6 log for cryptosporidium and 6 8 log for campylobacter the setback distances needed to realize this were calculated as per eq 6 in this equation the values of λ found by the microbial tracer tests were used as well as the values for the estimated upscaled λ as an additional comparison a high and low value were used taken from the range of λ for sand and gravel in the literature pang 2009 table 4 shows setback distances calculated for each pumping rate based on the 60 day tot as per eq 7 as well as extrapolated from model results and based on the qmra eq 6 for each pathogen the results show that a pumping rate increase from 1 to 10 l s can lead to a 1 0 3 8 times greater setback distance depending on the method used setback distances for campylobacter were similar or smaller than for cryptosporidium due to the higher inactivation rates 0 11 5 versus 0 011 log day respectively sidhu et al 2010 however cryptosporidium is larger than b subtilis and might therefore experience additional removal processes such as straining and or wedging headd and bradford 2016 li et al 2006 tufenkji et al 2004 therefore the setback distances for cryptosporidium can be regarded as conservative for low values of λ setback distances varied more with pumping rate than for higher λ this is because at lower λ inactivation becomes more important due to the longer travel times compared to the 60 day tot method the setback distances as calculated by qmra can be either smaller or larger depending on the pathogen and the chosen value of λ table 4 the setback distances for both pathogens as calculated with the estimated upscaled λ 700 m for the highest pumping rate are similar to the model derived 60 day tot setback distances this shows that at least in this study the best estimates for setback distances based on qmra do not differ greatly from the 60 day tot distance and highlights that the tot method is still viable if the necessary data for qmra is not available especially when considering its greater ease of use however whereas the 60 day tot method is considered to be sufficient for all pathogens the qmra in this study was only done for cryptosporidium and campylobacter other pathogens might have different source concentrations removal parameters and dose response curves which could lead to vastly different setback distances still these results are in contrast with findings by schijven et al 2006 who calculated by qmra that protection zones of 1 2 years were needed to reach the same health based target however schijven et al 2006 did their analysis for viruses in raw sewage water leaking through a pipe into a uniform sand aquifer the situation in this study is very different as it assumes infiltration of river water through the riverbank even though pathogen concentrations in a river can increase drastically after heavy rainfalls strongly affecting setback distances this study accounts for this variability in source concentration by using results from a probabilistic deterministic water quality model demeter et al 2021 important parameters in the calculation of setback distances by qmra are λ and inactivation rate μ because it is not easy to find accurate values for these parameters literature values are often used instead a challenge is that a large range of values exists in the literature even for the same aquifer type as is the case for λ in gravel aquifers pang 2009 this is shown in table 4 where using different λ for alluvial gravel aquifers can yield vastly different setback distances in the case of campylobacter setback distances varied by 1 2 log depending on which value of μ was chosen which shows that the effect of μ on setback distance is greater than that of pumping rate or flow gradient this underlines the importance of obtaining reliable μ and λ values for the calculation of setback distances with qmra in situ batch tests and field tracer tests are the most reliable methods to determine these parameters however besides the practical difficulties inherent in carrying out these tests interpreting the resulting λ values poses further difficulties because λ can change with pumping rate as well as with scale therefore it is additionally important to consider scaling for the calculation of setback distances with qmra unfortunately our methods of upscaling are not yet adequate for reliably estimating λ at larger scales ideally there would be multiple sampling points to capture the effects of changing λ with distance or microbial tracer tests would be done from the furthest possible point from the drinking water well such as a river to be able to accurately calculate setback distances based on qmra it is important not only to obtain reliable transport parameters but also to understand the hydrogeological setting if the source of pathogens is a river there might be additional inactivation due to sunlight exposure bambic et al 2015 rosa and giuseppina 2016 if the river has a static riverbank a colmation layer might be present at the river aquifer interface which would dramatically increase removal derx et al 2014 derx et al 2010 on the other hand if the riverbank is natural or if the likely source of pathogens is from a pipe located near the saturated zone this attenuation effect would be largely diminished 5 conclusions this study shows that when removal λ is low varying the flow rate can have a large influence on setback distance calculations inactivation μ is also an extremely important parameter when the value of λ is small and setback distances are calculated with a qmra approach the literature range of λ and in the case of some pathogens μ is very broad which can lead to inaccurate setback distances for this reason tracer tests with surrogates should be performed at the site of interest but care should be taken as to which surrogates are used as well as which transport distance should be used to reliably determine λ unfortunately it is not always possible to carry out tracer tests over large enough distances and thus it is important to create better and more reliable upscaling methods to be able to do so not only are more studies with microbial tracer tests needed at the column and field scale but also more studies comparing different field scales i e field studies in the same aquifer but with different transport distances as well as studies at the mesoscale for example in large 1 m columns funding this work was supported by the vienna science and technology fund wwtf grant esr17 070 giardy

1251,to guarantee proper protection from fecally transmitted pathogen infections drinking water wells should have a sufficiently large setback distance from potential sources of contamination e g a nearby river the aim of this study was to provide insight in regards to microbial contamination of groundwater under different flow velocities which can vary over time due to changes in river stage season or pumping rate the effects of these changes and how they affect removal parameters are not completely understood in this study field tracer tests were carried out in a sandy gravel aquifer near vienna austria to evaluate the ability of subsurface media to attenuate bacillus subtilis spores used as a surrogate for cryptosporidium and campylobacter the hydraulic gradient between injection and extraction was controlled by changing the pumping rate 1 10 l s of a pumping well at the test site building upon previously published work in which tracer tests with a 5 l s pumping rate were carried out attachment and detachment rate coefficients were determined using a hydrus 3d model and ranged from 0 12 to 0 76 and 0 0 0013 h 1 respectively setback distances were calculated based on the 60 day travel time as well as a quantitative microbial risk assessment qmra approach which showed similar results at this site around 700 m at the highest pumping rate removal rates λ in the field tests ranged from 0 2 to 0 3 log m with lower pumping rates leading to higher removal it was shown that scale must be taken into consideration when determining λ for the calculation of safe setback distances keywords riverbank filtration tracer test qmra safe setback distance cryptosporidium campylobacter 1 introduction waterborne disease outbreaks are still a major health issue worldwide beer et al 2015 beller 1997 rasmuson et al 2019 to reduce the risk of these outbreaks pre treatment steps such as riverbank filtration can be used to lower pathogen concentration ray et al 2002 sharma et al 2012 during subsurface flow the removal of pathogens is influenced by groundwater flow rate which can vary due to factors such as groundwater abstraction river stage seasonal changes city planning decisions such as stream rehabilitation and effects of climate change furthermore water level fluctuations can lead to higher concentrations of pathogens derx et al 2013 in many countries an adequate removal of pathogens is usually assumed when subsurface travel times are 60 days or more and setback distances for drinking water wells are often calculated on this basis schijven and hassanizadeh 2002 however in contrast to this 60 day time of travel tot approach the world health organization who has recommended that a quantitative microbial risk assessment qmra approach should be used for defining safe setback distances for drinking water production who 2011 2017 to be able to carry out a qmra reliable transport and removal parameters describing subsurface flow are needed to accurately quantify these parameters tracer tests should be carried out at the site of interest using surrogates that experience similar transport and removal as pathogenic microorganisms studies in columns show that faster flow rates can lead to less removal choi et al 2007 ryan and gschwend 1994 walshe et al 2010 and attachment and detachment rates have been shown to vary with decreasing pore velocity bradford et al 2006 hendry et al 1999 an explanation for this is that lower velocity leads to longer residence times which increase the probability of microbes to diffuse over the energy barrier as well as leading to lower hydrodynamic forces decreasing detachment sasidharan et al 2017 furthermore colloid filtration theory cft predicts that the attachment efficiency α is dependent on the single collector contact efficiency η0 which in turn depends on the flow velocity because it affects among other processes the particle deposition rate due to interception tufenkji and elimelech 2004 yao et al 1971 this shows that velocity is an important factor affecting bacterial removal in groundwater however most tracer tests in the field are carried out within natural i e unforced gradient flow conditions which makes it difficult to observe the effects of different flow rates on microbial removal directly deborde et al 1999 mallén et al 2005 pang et al 2005 comparing removal rates at different flow velocities is usually done by comparing tests in different aquifers and few tests have been carried out with varying flow rates at the same test site kvitsand et al 2015 pang 2009 therefore it is not well understood at the field scale if and how changes in flow velocity affect microbial removal and the parameters that govern it in order to compare setback distances at the various flow rates a qmra was carried out for cryptosporidium and campylobacter as well as calculations of the traditional 60 day tot both pathogens considered in this study are commonly found in human and animal waste and can cause gastrointestinal illnesses leading to severe and prolonged diarrhea which might pose significant health risks especially for vulnerable and immunocompromised patients hoogenboezem et al 2001 percival and williams 2013 teunis et al 2005 teunis et al 2002 who 2011 campylobacter are fecally borne bacteria that have led to numerous waterborne disease outbreaks in the past years even in developed countries craun 2012 guzman herrador et al 2015 cryptosporidium are protozoa usually present in the form of oocysts which resist degradation and are generally more persistent in the environment not unlike spores of b subtilis headd and bradford 2016 campylobacter is removed more readily as it is not spore or oocyst forming and therefore experiences more die off and inactivation processes whereby the organism either dies or is unable to infect schijven et al 2013 the groundwater flow rates in this study were controlled by changing the pumping rate of an abstraction well in the area where tracer tests were carried out using spores of bacillus subtilis these endospore forming bacteria are very persistent during transport and are therefore regarded as worst case scenario microbial tracers to study the removal of bacteria in the subsurface li et al 2018 pang et al 1998 setlow 1995 b subtilis 1 5 μm long is of similar size when compared to many important bacterial pathogens such as salmonella spp and campylobacter spp and is also used as a surrogate for cryptosporidium spp which is up to 7 μm long even though there are differences in size surface charge and hydrophobicity bradford et al 2016a emelko and huck 2004 cools et al 2003 chen et al 2010 this study builds upon a previous study by oudega et al 2021 by performing additional field tracer tests at different pumping rates which are modeled in hydrus 3d to attain reliable parameters for the assessment of alluvial aquifers furthermore this study adds a comparison of the 60 day tot versus the qmra approach for defining the setback distances from a drinking water well using cryptosporidium and campylobacter as reference pathogens 2 materials and methods 2 1 field site the study was carried out at the obere lobau test site located near the river danube in vienna austria and contains alluvial sediments of mostly gravel and sand d50 4 mm cu 38 4 the effective porosity of the material is 0 12 and the hydraulic conductivity is 7 5 10 3 m s the groundwater at the site is not in direct contact with danube river water due to the presence of a dam and contains little to no oxygen a near neutral ph and a high iron content a more extensive description of the study site sediment and groundwater characteristics is given in oudega et al 2021 the site contains an injection well p24 and a pumping well lb13 at a distance of 25 m which also serves as the sampling point fig 1 there are additional pumping wells north and south of the study site which together create a drawdown of hydraulic head and a predominantly west to east groundwater flow the injection well has a well screen from 8 to 14 m depth the pumping well has a well screen from 5 to 23 m depth and both well screens are located fully in the saturated zone 2 2 experimental design to allow for direct comparison of transport processes at different flow rates duplicate tracer tests were performed in a forced gradient system with pumping rates of 1 5 and 10 l s table 1 these pumping rates are about an order of magnitude lower than the maximum extraction rates in drinking water wells downstream of the study site however due to regulations higher pumping rates were not allowed the flow rates given in this table are averages over the transport distance but not uniform as they increase towards the pumping well all experiments were done with spores of b subtilis and a conservative tracer either uranine or bromide tests 5a b were done with bromide using a pumping rate of 5 l s results published in oudega et al 2021 the additional tests for this study were carried out with uranine tests 1a b with a 1 l s pumping rate and tests 10a b with a 10 l s pumping rate test 1pre was carried out with both bromide and uranine to check whether the transport behavior of the two conservative tracers was comparable to one another the absolute difference in gradient between duplicate experiments was never 2 8 2 3 characteristics culture and essay of the tracers 2 3 1 bacillus subtilis all tests were carried out with b subtilis endospores strain atcc 6633 which are rod shaped aerobic and non pathogenic bacteria present in low temperature environments harden and harris 1953 headd and bradford 2016 wightman et al 2001 in the spore state b subtilis bacteria are well protected against damage and survive for a long time setlow 1995 setlow and johnson 2019 using an electron microscope fei company hillsboro usa the spores were measured to be 1 5 μm in length and 0 5 μm in width they have an isoelectric point of ph 2 2 and are strongly hydrophilic bradford et al 2016b harden and harris 1953 preparation and assay was described in oudega et al 2021 the spores were injected in a concentration of approximately 109 spores ml the suspension of 1 5 l groundwater was injected in 1 5 min at 7 m depth by using a peristaltic pump samples of 12 ml were taken by an autosampler from a flow through cell linked to pumping well lb13 and stored in glass test tubes an initial interval of 5 min between samples was used in tests 5a b and 10a b and 60 min in tests 1a b these intervals were extended after the peaks passed depending on the expected concentration sample volumes of 1 2 3 6 or 9 ml were used on one or up to three petri dishes the lower the expected concentration the higher was the sample volume analyzed using the pour plating technique and pc agar merck darmstadt germany 2 3 2 bromide according to the maximum concentration of 100 mg l nabr permitted by the government the bromide 100 g was injected in a volume of 1000 l groundwater to ensure sufficient concentration in the samples the bromide solution was injected by fuel pump 2 min after the injection of the b subtilis spore suspension and took approximately 15 min we assumed no mixing between the two tracer solutions the samples were analyzed at the tu wien with hp lc chromatography metrohm eco ic herisau switzerland 2 3 3 uranine uranine was used in tests 1a b and 10a b in a concentration of 10 g l and a volume of 10 l groundwater using the same injection method as for bromide the fluorescence of the water was measured directly in the flow through cell using a ggun fl24 flow through field fluorospectrophotometer albillia co neuchatel switzerland 2 4 modeling 2 4 1 hydrus the field tests were modeled using hydrus 3d software šimůnek et al 2016 the three dimensional domain was defined as a cuboid with a depth of 24 m which is the top of a clayey aquitard in the study area constant heads were assigned to the domain boundaries upstream and downstream as well as on the main pumping well as to maintain perfect control over the hydraulic gradient fig 1 no flow conditions were assigned to the north and south boundaries on either side of the flow line except for two pumping wells on these boundaries which were modeled by constant discharge the values for hydraulic conductivity were found by calibration on the basis of the measured water levels in the piezometers during tests the injection solution was assumed to be mixed in the entire well screen calibration of dispersivity values was done by fitting the modeled breakthrough curves btcs of conservative tracers to the measured data more details about the model and its parameters can be found in oudega et al 2021 to calculate the model derived 60 day tot distances the modeled hydraulic gradient was extrapolated in space for each test darcy s equation was then employed using the calibrated values for hydraulic conductivity and porosity the subsurface flow was simulated in 3 dimensions with the richards equation simunek et al 2012 1 θ t x i k h k ij a h x j k iz a where θ is the water content t is time t xi is the spatial coordinate l k is the hydraulic conductivity l t h is the pressure head l and kij a are components of a dimensionless anisotropy tensor the transport of spores of b subtilis was modeled

coefficients respectively were found by calibrating the model to the btc of each test 2 4 2 qmraspot qmraspot is a computational tool to analyze and conduct a quantitative microbial risk assessment qmra for drinking water it was used for this study site to calculate the necessary removal of cryptosporidium oocysts and campylobacter during subsurface transport the model uses monte carlo simulations to calculate the risk of infection based on the distribution of the input data as well pathogen specific dose response parameters schijven et al 2011 this is done in order to reach a health based target which is the criterion to minimize the risk of infection below 10 4 person year based on recommendations by the who who 2011 to reach this target qmraspot was calibrated by trial and error for the necessary subsurface removal the input parameters for the program are given in table 2 the source concentrations of cryptosporidium and campylobacter were obtained from demeter et al 2021 who used a probabilistic deterministic water quality model of the danube which considered the major wastewater sources upstream of the study site this water quality model produced a mean and 95th percentile concentration for each pathogen from which the program created a distribution to run 10 000 monte carlo simulations resulting in a specific risk infections person year two separate inactivation rates were used for campylobacter because of large differences in the literature for cryptosporidium these differences were smaller and therefore of less influence on the resulting setback distances which is why only one value was used dose response curves for each pathogen are included in the program schijven et al 2011 teunis et al 2005 teunis et al 2002 2 5 analytical methods btcs for the conservative tracers and b subtilis were plotted as sample concentrations over time normalized by the initial concentration from this data spatial removal rates λ 1 l for b subtilis spores were calculated for each test as per eq 5 which is valid for three dimensions if the flow rate is constant kretzschmar et al 1997 pang 2009 5 λ ln q n 0 0 t f c t dt x 2 3 log 10 q n 0 0 t f c t dt x where q is the flow rate in the well l3 t n0 is the total amount of microbial tracer injected m c t the concentration at a given time t after injection m l3 tf is the final time of the test t and x the distance traveled to the pumping well l the integration was approximated by dividing the time series into sampling intervals of which it was assumed that the sample concentration was an average value for that time interval the setback distance for the qmra method was calculated by the 1d advection dispersion equation coupled with the removal λ and inactivation rate modified from blaschke et al 2016 6 x 2 3 2 α l log f 1 1 4 α l λ v μ v where f is calculated by qmraspot and is the necessary removal of cryptosporidium or campylobacter by subsurface transport as a fraction to meet the health based target αl is the longitudinal dispersivity l and μ is the inactivation rate 1 t as a comparison to the model derived 60 day tot described above the setback distance based on the austrian 60 day tot regulation was calculated by trial and error as per eq 7 övgw 2004 7 t 0 462 0 045 k f u x q u h gw 2 π ln 1 x u h gw 2 π q where kf is the hydraulic conductivity l t u is the darcy velocity l t and hgw is the height of the water column in the aquifer l 2 6 upscaling of λ in this study the values for λ were found for a distance of 25 m and may not be representative for larger transport distances as λ has been reported to decrease with an increase in travel distance hornstra et al 2018 kvitsand et al 2015 schijven and šimůnek 2002 explanations for this phenomenon include distance related straining processes reduction of the ionic strength of the input solution over time due to dilution blocking of favorable attachment sites and bacterial heterogeneity bradford et al 2007 pang 2009 camesano et al 1999 because the necessary setback distances are likely an order of magnitude larger than this distance the obtained values for λ from the experiments might yield setback distances that are too small which could lead to potential health hazards to solve this problem an upscaled λ was estimated using the literature comparison in oudega et al 2021 from which a relationship between travel distance and λ can be formulated fig 2 the relationship of y corresponding to λfield λcolumn and x corresponding to transport distance was then used to calculate the ratio of λfield λcolumn at larger transport distances because the value of λcolumn is known λfield can be calculated at a different transport distance because the relationship as found in fig 2 has no data points with a transport distance larger than 97 m harvey et al 2008 scaling beyond this point would be unreliable therefore a transport distance of 96 m was chosen as a characteristic length for upscaling λ since this relationship is merely a first step to understanding the upscaling relationship at different transport distances the resulting λ values have a very high uncertainty therefore the upscaling of λ is used here only to showcase how setback distances could change if tracer tests are performed at different distances highlighting the importance of reliably determining λ 3 results 3 1 comparison of bromide and uranine as conservative tracers to ascertain that direct comparisons were possible between bromide and uranine a test with both conservative tracers was carried out the results show that bromide and uranine behave similarly in terms of peak timing and change in concentration fig 3 note that bromide was injected in a 100 times larger volume than uranine hence the 2 log difference in c c0 this might also change flow properties such as dispersion between the tests leading to slightly differing results a further explanation of the differences between the two conservative tracers is that uranine might experience sorption to aquifer grains during subsurface flow dollinger et al 2017 as bromide does not experience sorption a higher concentration may be transported to the pumping well lastly the difference in sampling and measurement methods might cause differences between the btcs bromide was sampled by an autosampler while uranine was measured in the flow through cell with a fluorescence meter which is an advantage over sampling because of the high temporal resolution the recovery rates were 67 7 for bromide and 63 3 for uranine the similarities were considered sufficient to approve using uranine at this study site as a conservative tracer 3 2 bacillus subtilis spores breakthrough and model results in tests 1a b the b subtilis concentrations are in the range of the limit of quantification due to the low concentrations in the zed samples fig 4 1a and 1b at t 30 h b subtilis peaked earlier than the conservative tracer showing that pore size exclusion is an important process in the study area grindrod et al 1996 pang et al 2005 this in turn affects the dispersivity values in the model which were lower for b subtilis than for the conservative tracers table 3 this is because the microbial tracers travel predominantly through larger and better connected pores leading to a more advective and less dispersive transport than the conservative tracers pang et al 1998 the peak c c0 breakthrough was 4 2 10 9 showing a peak reduction of just under 9 log the very early breakthrough in test 1a was assumed to be contamination both tests exhibit significant tailing as well as breakthrough of higher concentrations after the initial peak has passed the high concentration in spore samples at t 60 h in both tests 1a and 1b in tests 5a b peak concentrations were around 4 times higher than in tests 1a b furthermore peak time was much earlier than the conservative tracer peak the reduction in peak concentration was approximately 8 logs the outliers were likely a product of sample contamination in tests 10a b btcs were less irregular than in the lower pumping rate tests which can be attributed to the higher concentrations in the analyzed samples concentrations peaked at approximately t 4 69 h with c c0 at 3 75 10 8 around 3 4 times higher than tests 5a b an overview of the tests is shown in table 3 with the removal rates for b subtilis as calculated per eq 5 and values for katt and kdet taken from the modeling study 4 discussion 4 1 hydrus 3d modeling the ratio of cmax c0 for b subtilis spores in the tracer tests was generally 10 8 10 9 compared to 10 3 for the conservative tracers table 3 this shows that removal processes are important for colloid transport in this area many studies have ascertained that no significant inactivation of b subtilis spores took place after time periods from 7 days up to 45 days greskowiak et al 2006 li et al 2018 pang et al 1998 pike et al 1969 ratcliffe 1995 and because the fraction of colloid size to median grain size 0 0003 in our experiments is smaller than 0 0017 straining should not occur bradford et al 2002 for these reasons the removal of b subtilis in this study was assumed to be governed by attachment two attachment and detachments rate coefficients were necessary to accurately model the tailing of the b subtilis btcs in this model katt1 mainly controls the height of the peak concentration while katt2 kdet1 and kdet2 mainly control the shape of the falling limb of the btc schijven et al 2001 table 3 shows the attachment and detachment rate coefficients that were found for each experiment the difference between attachment sites can be explained by microbial population heterogeneity i e certain b subtilis spores within the colloidal population are inherently more or less likely to attach to sorption sites due to differences in their surface structure or charge foppen and schijven 2006 schijven and hassanizadeh 2000 however the more widely accepted explanation is that physical heterogeneity is more important i e certain attachment sites are more likely to capture b subtilis spores than others this could depend on multiple factors for example the extent of the favorable attachment sites or their charge i e iron content ginn et al 2002 knapp et al 1998 schijven and šimůnek 2002 it was found that katt1 was lowest for the lowest flow rate tests 1 l s but in the middle and highest flow rate tests 5 and 10 l s respectively katt1 was similar other studies have also found an increase in attachment rate with pore water velocity v on both the column and field scale hendry et al 1999 hijnen et al 2005 schijven et al 2001 kdet1 katt2 and kdet2 were also found to increase with v this shows that the ratio of reversibly attached particles increases with v which affirms previous findings bradford et al 2016b more reversible attachment might be an important mechanism that causes removal to decrease with an increase in flow rate even though the attachment rate coefficients increased with flow rate overall removal decreased due to shorter residence times a pumping rate change from 1 to 10 l s decreased the removal rate λ by 30 table 3 this is supported by the literature on field tracer studies which generally states that an increase in flow rate decreases removal camesano and logan 1998 kvitsand et al 2015 pang 2009 which in this study ranges from 0 19 to 0 28 log m typically values for λ are in the range of 10 2 10 1 log m for sand and gravel aquifers but in gravel aquifers with a flow rate 11 m d can be as low as 10 3 log m pang 2009 the values for λ in this study are on the higher side of this range which might be due to the high amount of fine material present at this study s field site the d50 is 4 mm versus for example 18 mm at the burnham test site pang et al 2005 another explanation is that there could be differences in sphericity and or surface roughness of the material which can influence attachment saiers and ryan 2005 shellenberger and logan 2002 lastly the high iron content in the groundwater of our study site points to the presence of iron oxides which can function as attachment sites leading to enhanced microbial attachment ginn et al 2002 knapp et al 1998 4 2 setback distances the computations with qmraspot showed that to reach the health based target the necessary total subsurface removal was 5 6 log for cryptosporidium and 6 8 log for campylobacter the setback distances needed to realize this were calculated as per eq 6 in this equation the values of λ found by the microbial tracer tests were used as well as the values for the estimated upscaled λ as an additional comparison a high and low value were used taken from the range of λ for sand and gravel in the literature pang 2009 table 4 shows setback distances calculated for each pumping rate based on the 60 day tot as per eq 7 as well as extrapolated from model results and based on the qmra eq 6 for each pathogen the results show that a pumping rate increase from 1 to 10 l s can lead to a 1 0 3 8 times greater setback distance depending on the method used setback distances for campylobacter were similar or smaller than for cryptosporidium due to the higher inactivation rates 0 11 5 versus 0 011 log day respectively sidhu et al 2010 however cryptosporidium is larger than b subtilis and might therefore experience additional removal processes such as straining and or wedging headd and bradford 2016 li et al 2006 tufenkji et al 2004 therefore the setback distances for cryptosporidium can be regarded as conservative for low values of λ setback distances varied more with pumping rate than for higher λ this is because at lower λ inactivation becomes more important due to the longer travel times compared to the 60 day tot method the setback distances as calculated by qmra can be either smaller or larger depending on the pathogen and the chosen value of λ table 4 the setback distances for both pathogens as calculated with the estimated upscaled λ 700 m for the highest pumping rate are similar to the model derived 60 day tot setback distances this shows that at least in this study the best estimates for setback distances based on qmra do not differ greatly from the 60 day tot distance and highlights that the tot method is still viable if the necessary data for qmra is not available especially when considering its greater ease of use however whereas the 60 day tot method is considered to be sufficient for all pathogens the qmra in this study was only done for cryptosporidium and campylobacter other pathogens might have different source concentrations removal parameters and dose response curves which could lead to vastly different setback distances still these results are in contrast with findings by schijven et al 2006 who calculated by qmra that protection zones of 1 2 years were needed to reach the same health based target however schijven et al 2006 did their analysis for viruses in raw sewage water leaking through a pipe into a uniform sand aquifer the situation in this study is very different as it assumes infiltration of river water through the riverbank even though pathogen concentrations in a river can increase drastically after heavy rainfalls strongly affecting setback distances this study accounts for this variability in source concentration by using results from a probabilistic deterministic water quality model demeter et al 2021 important parameters in the calculation of setback distances by qmra are λ and inactivation rate μ because it is not easy to find accurate values for these parameters literature values are often used instead a challenge is that a large range of values exists in the literature even for the same aquifer type as is the case for λ in gravel aquifers pang 2009 this is shown in table 4 where using different λ for alluvial gravel aquifers can yield vastly different setback distances in the case of campylobacter setback distances varied by 1 2 log depending on which value of μ was chosen which shows that the effect of μ on setback distance is greater than that of pumping rate or flow gradient this underlines the importance of obtaining reliable μ and λ values for the calculation of setback distances with qmra in situ batch tests and field tracer tests are the most reliable methods to determine these parameters however besides the practical difficulties inherent in carrying out these tests interpreting the resulting λ values poses further difficulties because λ can change with pumping rate as well as with scale therefore it is additionally important to consider scaling for the calculation of setback distances with qmra unfortunately our methods of upscaling are not yet adequate for reliably estimating λ at larger scales ideally there would be multiple sampling points to capture the effects of changing λ with distance or microbial tracer tests would be done from the furthest possible point from the drinking water well such as a river to be able to accurately calculate setback distances based on qmra it is important not only to obtain reliable transport parameters but also to understand the hydrogeological setting if the source of pathogens is a river there might be additional inactivation due to sunlight exposure bambic et al 2015 rosa and giuseppina 2016 if the river has a static riverbank a colmation layer might be present at the river aquifer interface which would dramatically increase removal derx et al 2014 derx et al 2010 on the other hand if the riverbank is natural or if the likely source of pathogens is from a pipe located near the saturated zone this attenuation effect would be largely diminished 5 conclusions this study shows that when removal λ is low varying the flow rate can have a large influence on setback distance calculations inactivation μ is also an extremely important parameter when the value of λ is small and setback distances are calculated with a qmra approach the literature range of λ and in the case of some pathogens μ is very broad which can lead to inaccurate setback distances for this reason tracer tests with surrogates should be performed at the site of interest but care should be taken as to which surrogates are used as well as which transport distance should be used to reliably determine λ unfortunately it is not always possible to carry out tracer tests over large enough distances and thus it is important to create better and more reliable upscaling methods to be able to do so not only are more studies with microbial tracer tests needed at the column and field scale but also more studies comparing different field scales i e field studies in the same aquifer but with different transport distances as well as studies at the mesoscale for example in large 1 m columns funding this work was supported by the vienna science and technology fund wwtf grant esr17 070 giardy

1252,many studies have used numerical simulations and experiments to simulate saltwater intrusion in a nearshore aquifer thus it is known that seawater recirculation occurs in a porous medium just below a sloping beach and a saltwater wedge occurs in the medium below where the slope intersects the water level at low tide this study investigated the salt distribution in the surface water when subterranean recirculation of seawater is occurring and there is a saltwater wedge in an underlying porous medium along with the relationships between the seawater recirculation and the tidal amplitude and beach gradient the salt distribution in a subterranean aquifer and in surface seawater where the shore sloped gently seaward with a constant slope of 1 10 or 1 5 under tidal amplitudes of 0 5 1 0 or 2 0 m was numerically simulated by the asgmf method which couples water pressure and water flow in a porous medium with those in the overlying surface water and can simulate variable density flows and the salt concentration distribution in both the porous medium and the surface water the results showed that the recirculation of seawater depended on the tidal amplitude being greater when the amplitude exceeded 1 0 m but that it was unlikely to occur when the beach gradient was steep thus the aspect ratio width to depth of the seawater recirculation decreased as the tidal amplitude increased above 1 0 m furthermore the simulated surface water level was often lower than the tidal water level thus the surface water level was not consistent with the tidal water level imposed at the right boundary of the simulation domain but varied slightly under the influence of water flow in the surface water and gas flow in the atmosphere the salt concentration in the surface water was not always the same as the seawater salt concentration because a thin freshwater layer and a brackish water layer of mixed freshwater and saltwater overlay the seawater keywords recirculation saltwater wedge salt intrusion variable density flow advection dispersion equation multiphase flow 1 introduction many studies have numerically simulated saltwater intrusion in a nearshore aquifer these numerical simulations can be classified according to the outside oceanic forcing considered 1 constant seawater level 2 tidal forcing 3 wave forcing and 4 a combination of wave and tide forcing numerical simulations of a saltwater wedge in a porous medium under a constant seawater level are classic examples e g langevin et al 2010 lin et al 2009 lu et al 2013 2015 nishikawa et al 2009 pool and carrera 2010 webb and howard 2011 these numerical simulations represented only the saltwater wedge in a porous medium by using darcy s law a mass conservation equation with variable density flow and an advection dispersion equation for salt migration in the water phase of the porous medium thus they targeted only the porous medium however tides and waves cause nearshore seawater levels to fluctuate and these oceanic forces can influence subterranean saltwater migration around the shoreline accordingly elad et al 2017 and guo et al 2019 conducted numerical simulations of seawater flow in a subterranean coastal aquifer forced by tidal fluctuations by using only darcy s law and the advection dispersion equation for porous media robinson et al 2007a goswami and clement 2007b numerically simulated subterranean seawater recirculation beneath an onshore beach surface and the main subterranean saltwater wedge due to tidal fluctuation by treating the seawater domain as a saturated highly permeable porous medium porosity 1 0 with a high hydraulic conductivity 106 m d filled with saltwater with a salt concentration of 35 ppt where the upper surface of the seawater domain fluctuated according to a specific tidal amplitude and period robinson et al 2007a 2007b employed only darcy s law with variable density flow combined with an advection dispersion equation for a porous medium saturated with water they did not rigorously solve water flows and salt migration in the seawater xin et al 2010 robinson et al 2014 and yang et al 2013 used the empirical formula of nielsen 2009 and depth averaged shallow water equations hibberd and peregrine 1979 li et al 2002 or the diffusive wave equation viessman and lewis 1996 to represent fluctuations of the seawater surface elevation due to waves and tides however these simulations could not represent water flow and salt transport in the seawater because these methods treat water pressure in the seawater as hydrostatic instead like robinson et al 2007a 2007b they treated the seawater region as a highly permeable porous medium with a constant salt concentration bakhtyar et al 2011 represented waves and tides by using a k ε turbulence closure model based on the navier stokes equations and the volume of fluid method hirt and nichols 1981 lopez de bertodano et al 1994 to simulate two phase gas water flow and migration interfaces between gas and water however even though this method can calculate water flow and water pressure under non hydrostatic conditions to simulate salt transport they treated the seawater region as a fictitious porous medium with very high permeability and did not use the calculated non hydrostatic water pressure and water flow moreover xin et al 2010 and robinson et al 2014 like robinson et al 2007a 2007b conducted simulations for only a porous medium saturated with water and not an unsaturated porous medium in contrast hibi 2020 developed a numerical simulation method that combines seawater flow with subterranean water flow and can reproduce salt transport in both the nearshore seawater and groundwater furthermore hibi 2020 confirmed that the results obtained with the developed numerical simulation method were consistent with experimental results obtained in a tank in which both surface seawater and a subterranean estuary in a porous medium compacted sand were reproduced in these tank experiments freshwater infiltrated the sand from the side of the tank opposite the seawater side and a saltwater wedge eventually formed in the porous medium around the shoreline although as indicated above robinson et al 2007a 2007b xin et al 2010 bakhtyar et al 2011 and robinson et al 2014 could perfectly reproduce the subterranean recirculation of seawater just below an onshore surface and the main seawater wedge in a porous medium around a shoreline caused by tides and waves they did not verify their assumption that the nearshore seawater salt concentration is always constant either experimentally or by numerical simulation this study however conducted numerical simulations for reproducing the recirculation and circulation the saltwater wedge of seawater in a porous medium and surface water caused by tides with analytical domains consisting of a porous medium surface water and atmosphere no numerical simulations considering water flow and the migration of salt in the surface water have been carried out previously under tidal fluctuation accordingly by using the atmosphere surface water groundwater multi flow asgmf method this study investigated the salt distribution in surface seawater with consideration of the water flow and the salt migration in surface water when subterranean seawater recirculation is occurring and there is a main seawater wedge onshore and around the shoreline further it examined the relationships between the recirculation of seawater and the tidal amplitude and between the recirculation of seawater and the beach gradient thus the salt distribution in a subterranean aquifer and in the nearshore seawater under oceanic forcing by tides where the shore sloped gently seaward with a constant slope 1 10 or 1 5 was simulated by using the numerical simulation method developed by the author 2 numerical simulation theory and procedure 2 1 theory fluid flows in surface water and a porous medium can be rigorously solved by applying navier stokes equations and employing a multiphase flow numerical technique that considers water retention in the porous medium hibi and tomigashi 2015 2018 hibi et al 2015 and hibi 2020 have developed a numerical simulation method the asgmf method that employs a one field model for multiple immiscible fluids to simulate surface water flow and water saturation

van genuchten parameters and γ 1 1 β by substituting p g t δt p w t δt p cgw t into p t δt f w t p w t δt f g t p g t δt we obtain p t δt f w t f g t p w t δt f g t p cgw t where p g t δt and p w t δt at each nodal point are gas pressure and water pressure at time t δt respectively next we substitute f w t f g t 1 into p t δt f w t f g t p w t δt f g t p cgw t and then rearrange the result with

advection dispersion equation eq 23 to deal with the transfer of saltwater in the surface water and the water in the porous medium 23 c t v w θ c d ij c where c is the salt concentration in water θ is 1 0 in the surface water or the volumetric water content in the porous medium and d ij is dispersion in the i and j directions as follows 24a d ij d d in surface water 24b d ij τd d α t δ ij δ km α l

system here the position vector r i v w t δt φ δt is specified from v w t δt θ and v w t δt obtained by eqs 2 and 21a and c is c at r i v w t δt φ δt in the solute concentration field at time t then the distribution of c t δt is obtained by interpolating with cip for c and the backward difference method for time as follows 25 1 δ t c t δ t d ij c t δ t 1 δ t c finally eq 25 is discretized by using the galerkin finite element method fem asgmf handles variable density flows in a porous medium and surface water flow by using eq 26 because seawater is heavier than freshwater 26 ρ w ρ w freshwater c ρ w seawater ρ w freshwater c seawater where ρ w freshwater is the density of freshwater ρ w seawater is the density of seawater and c seawater is the salt concentration in the original seawater 2 2 procedure by discretizing eq 1 the analytical domain by the galerkin fem we obtain the following algebraic equation 27 1 ρ t j 1 n v n i n j dv p j t δ t q i v n i dv g 1 δ t j 1 n v n i

velocity at the position vector r j v t δt at the elapsed time t n i and n j are the shape function at the nodal points i and j respectively and ρ t is the average value of fluid density in an element the fluid velocity v t j 1 at the position vector r j v t j δt is first obtained by interpolation from the distribution of velocity at the elapsed time t to obtain v t in the position vector r j v t δt at the nodal point j here v t j is the velocity at the nodal point j at the elapsed time t second the fluid velocity v t j 2 is obtained at the position vector r j v t j 1 δt in the velocity field at the elapsed time t finally v t at the nodal point j is equal to the fluid velocity at the position vector r j v t j 1 v t j 2 δt 2 in the velocity field at the elapsed time t in addition q i is defined as follows 28 q i 1 ρ t j 1 n ω n i n j p j t δ t ρ t g n dω i 1 to n here ω is the perimeter of the analytical domain eq 27 must be simultaneously solved with the discretized eq 13 for the fluid pressure in the porous medium however the discrepancy between the gas pressure in the atmosphere and the synthetic pressure in the porous medium at the porous medium surface facing the atmosphere has to be considered in eq 13 the gas pressure in the atmosphere should be equal to that in a porous medium unsaturated with water however the synthetic pressure includes the water pressure multiplied by f w see eq 8 the synthetic pressure in the porous medium becomes similar to the atmospheric pressure because f w approaches zero as the water saturation becomes closer to zero as the water saturation in the porous medium approaches 1 0 however the synthetic pressure is different from the atmospheric pressure because f w increases to 1 0 with the water saturation this difference is equal to f w p cwg which can be obtained by eq 8 considering that p cgw p g po p w po and f n f g 1 as follows 29 p f w p w po f g p g po p g po f w p cwg eq 29 shows that the synthetic pressure is lower than the gas pressure in the porous medium as stated above the gas pressure in the porous medium equals the atmospheric pressure consequently the synthetic pressure should be lower than the atmospheric pressure at the surface by f w p cwg fig 1 by considering this difference f w p cwg at the surface eq 13 can be changed as follows 30 λ t k s p t δ t λ t k s p c t χ f w t p cwg t λ t k s

respectively at the elapsed time t λ t f g t p cgw t and f w t are the average of λ t f g t p cgw and f w t respectively in an element at the elapsed time t furthermore q i in eq 30 describes the

for the fluid pressure by the gauss seidel method or the successive overrelaxation sor method the velocity of fluid at each nodal point in the surface system can be obtained from the pressure of fluid

eq 4 p j t is the pressure of fluid at the nodal point j at the elapsed time t which has already been obtained by eqs 27 and 31 when this equation is solved in addition τ i in eq 33 is the shear force on the boundary of the analytical domain which is defined as follows 34 τ i μ t j 1 n ω n i n j n dω v j t δ t i 1 to n algebraic equations can be derived from eq 14 by discretization in the analytical domain with the galerkin fem by considering the difference f w p cwg as follows 35 v n i d v v t i t δ t j 1 n λ t k s v n i n j d v p j t δ t χ f wj t p cgwj t p cgw t v n i n j d v f g j t f w t ρ w f g t ρ g v n i d v g i 1 to n thus the total flow velocity at the elapsed time t δt at nodal point i in the porous medium v t i t δt can be obtained by using only the equation stated above however for the present problem it is necessary to consider interaction between fluid flows in the porous medium and the surface system at the boundary between the two regions accordingly eq 33 and eq 35 are simultaneously solved by using the gauss seidel method the sor method or the preconditioned conjugate gradient method in this case because eq 33 and eq 35 are employed in some elements on the surface system side and on the porous medium side respectively of a nodal point on the boundary between the porous medium and the surface system the interaction of the fluid flows in the two regions can be considered at the nodal point on the boundary between the two regions the void fraction of water s w at each nodal point in the surface water is obtained with eq 5 and the position vector can be computed using the fluid velocity obtained with eqs 33 and 35 however the total flow velocity obtained with eqs 33 and 35 cannot simply be used to migrate water saturation s w in the porous medium as in the surface system in the porous medium apparent velocity v soil t and the dispersion coefficient d soil t determined with eq 16 are needed at any nodal point in the porous medium for the water saturation migration hence df g ds w t dλ ds w t κ and dp cgw ds w t in eq 16 must be calculated at each nodal point from the water saturation obtained in the previous time step further v soil t and d soil t in eq 16 are computed using the total flow velocity and synthetic pressure values already obtained these v soil t and d soil t values are substituted into the algebraic equations obtained by discretizing eq 15 over the analytical domain with the galerkin fem as follows 36 v n i d v s w i t δ t δ t j 1 n d soil t v n i n j d v s w j t δ t δ t q w i v n i d v s w i i 1 to n where s w i t δt and s w j t δt are the water saturation at nodal points i and j respectively at the elapsed time t δt d soil t is the average of d soil in an element and s w i is the water saturation at r i v soil t δt in the water saturation field at the elapsed time t first v soil t i obtained at any nodal point i by using eq 16a is employed to decide v soil t in the position vector r i v soil t δt next v soil t i at the position r i v soil t i δt decided with v soil t i is obtained by interpolating with cip finally the position for interpolation of s w i is decided by r i v soil t i v soil t i δt 2 in addition q w i in eq 36 is defined as follows 37 q w i j 1 n d soil t ω n i n j s w j t δ t n dω i 1 to n water velocity in the porous medium and the surface water are needed to calculate the advection of the salt concentration in water the water velocity in the surface water has already been obtained by using eq 33 but only the total velocity in the porous medium has been obtained by eq 35 the water velocity at each nodal point in the porous medium including on the surface should be calculated with eq 20 using the synthetic pressure obtained by eq 31 and the capillary pressure between water and gas and f g t i at the nodal point i the position interpolating the salt concentration c i at the nodal point i by advection is consistent with r i v w i t δt v w i t δt 2φ δt where v w i t δt is the water velocity at the nodal point i obtained by eq 21 and v w i t δt is the water velocity at the position vector r i v w i t δt φ δt obtained by interpolation in the water velocity field at the elapsed time t δt then eq 25 is discretized over the analytical domain by using the galerkin fem as follows 38 v n i d v c i t δ t δ t j 1 n d i j v n i n j d v c j t δ t δ t q c i v n i d v c i i 1 to n where c i t δt and c j t δt are the salt concentration at nodal points i and j respectively at the elapsed time t δt d i j is the average of d i j which is the dispersion coefficient in an element in the i and j directions of the coordinate as shown in eq 24 further q c i in eq 38 is defined as follows 39 q c i j 1 n d i j ω n i n j c j t δ t n dω i 1 to n the salt concentration at each nodal point obtained by eq 38 is used to calculate the density of water at each nodal point with eq 26 further the relative permeabilities of the groundwater and the gas at each nodal point are calculated by eq 18 with the water saturation obtained as described above and these relative permeabilities are used to obtain λ t f g t and f w t at each nodal point the p cgw at each nodal point is calculated from the water saturation with eq 19 the intrusion recirculation and circulation of saltwater in the porous medium and surface seawater for seawater of various densities should depend on the density of seawater and is a nonlinear problem thus after completing the above calculations for one time step some iteration method inherently has to be used to solve this problem however an iteration method is not employed in the present numerical simulations with asgmf because the time increment δt was very short at 0 05 0 1 s the total velocity in the porous medium and the fluid velocity in the surface system obtained above are used to get the interpolation position of v at the next time step and the synthetic pressure and the fluid pressure at the next time step are obtained with eq 27 and 31 the total velocity the fluid velocity the water saturation and the void fraction of water and the salt concentration are calculated sequentially as described above asgmf repeats these calculations until the elapsed time reaches the maximum time fig 2 hibi 2020 has evaluated the accuracy of asgmf by comparing the results between two dimensional experiments and numerical simulations first results for transient variable density flow in only a porous medium unsaturated with water were compared between tank experiments conducted by goswami and clement 2007 and numerical simulations goswami and clement 2007 put compacted silica sand into a two dimensional plexiglas tank with a length of 53 cm a height of 30 5 cm and a width of 2 7 cm along with freshwater density 1 000 g cm3 and seawater density 1 026 g cm3 the compacted silica sand had an intrinsic permeability of 1 34 10 9 m2 a porosity of 0 385 a longitudinal dispersivity of 0 001 m and a transverse dispersivity of 0 0001 m the tank had a seawater reservoir on its left side and a freshwater reservoir on its right side the seawater level in the seawater reservoir was kept constant at a height of 25 5 cm from the bottom of the tank but the freshwater level in the freshwater reservoir was varied from a height of 26 7 cm to 26 2 cm and from a height of 26 2 cm to 26 55 cm above the bottom of the tank thus the flow in the porous medium in the tank was consistent with transient variable density flow without surface water flow the salt concentration distribution reproduced by numerical simulations of these tank experiments with asgmf was consistent with the experimental distribution in all cases consequently hibi 2020 verified that asgmf could accurately reproduce the salt concentration distribution caused by variable flow and salt transport in a porous medium without surface water flow next hibi 2020 conducted experiments in a two dimensional tank length 190 cm height 60 cm width 13 5 cm with two reservoirs each 4 cm long and 13 5 cm wide installed on either side of the tank one for supplying freshwater and the other for supplying saltwater into the tank first seawater was poured into the tank at the height of 35 5 cm from the bottom of the tank second glass beads with average grain size 0 2 mm were compacted into the tank at the height of 0 425 cm from the bottom of the tank at the boundary with the freshwater reservoir and at the height of 0 200 cm from the boundary with the saltwater reservoir thus the surface of the compacted glass beads sloped with a gradient of about 0 124 the compacted glass beads had an intrinsic permeability of 3 60 10 11 m2 a porosity of 0 405 a longitudinal dispersivity of 0 121 m and a transverse dispersivity of 0 0121 m further the saltwater and freshwater densities were 1 024 g cm3 and 1 000 g cm3 respectively at the start time of the experiment there was a layer of saltwater above the surface of the compacted glass beads on the saltwater reservoir side because the initial water level was at a height of 35 5 cm from the bottom of the tank the water level was kept constant at 38 8 cm in the freshwater reservoir and at 35 5 cm in the saltwater reservoir during the experiment as a result a main saltwater wedge developed which after an elapsed time of 20 h was stationary at a horizontal distance of 60 to 75 cm from the freshwater reservoir at this time there was a layer of freshwater with a thickness of 5 9 cm above the surface saltwater layer hibi 2020 simulated this two dimensional tank experiment using asgmf with an analytical domain that included the atmosphere and surface water regions comparison of the results between the numerical simulation and the experiment confirmed that the location and thickness of the main saltwater wedge reproduced by asgmf were similar to those in the experimental results and the thickness of the surface freshwater layer was identical to that in the experiment therefore hibi 2020 confirmed that asgmf could accurately reproduce the saltwater wedge in the porous medium and the surface freshwater layer obtained in the experimental results 3 configuration of models parameters and boundary and initial conditions for numerical simulations in this study numerical simulations were conducted by the asgmf method in the two dimensional vertical domain illustrated in fig 3 to obtain salt concentration distributions in seawater and in a subterranean estuary in the nearshore region in these numerical simulations tidal amplitudes were 0 50 m 1 0 m or 2 0 m and the beach gradient was 1 10 or 1 5 the analytical domain shown in fig 3 is consistent with that used by xin et al 2010 who simulated seawater intrusion into a subterranean estuary by using darcy s law and the mass conservation law with variable density of water and a solute transport equation however in the present study a pool with width 1 m was located at the left end of the domain and filled with water up to z 31 m which was equal to the initial water level thus a water head of 31 m and vertical and horizontal water velocities of 0 m s were imposed from z 0 m to 2 m at the left boundary of the domain fig 3 therefore the water pressure at this boundary was hydrostatic subject to the water level of 31 m the horizontal velocity of water was also zero from z 2 m to 60 m and both horizontal and vertical velocities of water and gas were zero from 32 m to 60 m at the left boundary of the domain in addition at the upper boundary gas pressure was zero and both the vertical and horizontal velocities of gas were zero furthermore the lower boundary of the domain was impermeable and the water level at the right boundary was specified by a series of time variation pressure as follows 40 h z h in a mp cos ω tid t where h z and h in are the water level at elapsed time t and the initial water level z 31 00 m at the right boundary respectively a mp and ω tid are the tidal amplitude and angular frequency respectively where ω tid is 1 4537 10 4 rad s the tidal water elevations obtained by eq 40 are illustrated in fig 4 for tidal amplitudes of 0 5 1 0 and 2 0 m water pressure at the right domain boundary was hydrostatic when the water level was equal to the value obtained by eq 40 and the gas pressure was static provided that the gas pressure was zero at the upper boundary in addition both horizontal and vertical water velocities of zero were imposed at the right boundary except in the porous medium and the salt concentration was imposed as 1 0 which is equal to the salt concentration of seawater at the right boundary to z not exceeding the water level the void fraction of water and water saturation were 1 0 below the water level and zero above the water level at the right boundary initial water pressure and gas pressure were equal to hydrostatic pressure subject to the initial water level z 31 00 m and static pressure subject to a gas pressure of zero on the upper boundary respectively in addition initial vertical and horizontal velocities of water and gas were both zero everywhere in the domain the initial salt concentration below the initial water level was 1 0 from x 151 m to 201 m and 0 0 from x 0 0 m to 151 m the initial void fraction of water and water saturation were 1 0 below the water level in both the surface water and the porous medium and the initial water saturation in the porous medium above the water level was calculated using the capillary pressure and the van genuchten equation van genuchten 1980 as follows 41 s w 1 αp cgw β γ the parameter values used in the present numerical simulations are shown in table 1 porosity the water retention curve and characteristics of dispersion in the porous medium used in these simulations were the same as those used in the simulations implemented by xin et al 2010 and robinson et al 2007a the diffusion coefficient was set to the generally accepted values and tortuosity was not considered in these simulations because values for the diffusion coefficient and tortuosity were not found in xin et al 2010 and robinson et al 2007a the density of seawater used in these simulations is consistent with a salt concentration of 35 ppt the value used in the simulations by xin et al 2010 and robinson et al 2007a and which is equal to a relative salt concentration of 1 0 densities and viscosities of freshwater and gas used in these simulations were approximately those at 20 c the permeability shown in table 1 is 1 55 times greater than that used in the simulations conducted by xin et al 2010 and robison et al 2007a because the computers used in this study do not have enough capability for these complicated numerical simulations if the permeability value used by xin et al 2010 and robinson et al 2007a had been used the computations for the present simulations would have been too time consuming therefore a greater permeability value was used here so that the recirculation of seawater onshore could be reproduced at a relatively early elapsed time 4 numerical simulation results and discussion salt concentration distributions in the porous medium and surface water were examined in simulations conducted to an elapsed time of up to 30 days for each of the three tidal amplitudes and two beach gradients the salt concentration distribution did not reach a steady state within the elapsed time of 30 days although ideally these simulations should be continued until a steady state was reached the computers used in this study cpu ryzen threadripper 3970 3 7ghz 32 cores 64 threads asgmf code parallelized by openmp did not have enough capacity to conduct the simulations to steady state therefore the simulations were terminated at the elapsed time of 30 days because the focus of this study was the salt concentration distribution in the surface water and by the elapsed time of 30 days seawater was beginning to recirculate just below the onshore portion of the beach using all 32 cores and the parallelized asgmf the present simulations required 21 to 28 days to be completed to an elapsed time of 30 days thus the calculation speed was close to one day per elapsed day when the tidal amplitude was 2 m and the beach gradient was 1 10 recirculation of seawater was already occurring below the onshore beach surface to a depth of 8 7 m by the elapsed time of 6 days fig 5c and the maximum depth of the recirculating seawater became deeper with elapsed time finally reaching a depth of 24 8 m similar to about 0 9 of the depth of the offshore thickness of the porous medium of 27 m fig 6 furthermore the slope of the main interface between the freshwater and the seawater the leading edge of the saltwater wedge became gentler as the area of the recirculating seawater expanded figs 5c f i l and o in contrast when the tidal amplitude was 0 5 m or 1 0 m and the beach gradient was 1 10 recirculation of seawater did not occur in the porous medium beneath the onshore beach surface until the elapsed time reached 9 days fig 6 however at the elapsed time of 9 days a freshwater layer 0 salt concentration 0 1 and a brackish layer of mixed freshwater and saltwater 0 1 salt concentration 0 9 were present in the surface water just below the top of the surface water figs 5d and e and fig 7 the freshwater and dilute brackish water layers remained in the surface water from 9 days until the elapsed time of 30 days but just before 30 days the depth of both layers 0 salt concentration 0 9 was 0 14 to 0 35 m below the top of the surface water when the tidal amplitude was 0 5 m and 0 3 to 0 40 m when the amplitude was 1 0 m fig 7a for a beach gradient of 1 10 the depths from the water level to the elevation with a salt concentration of 0 9 at high and low tide are shown in fig 7a and those from the water level to the elevation with a salt concentration of 0 1 at high and low tide are shown in fig 7b when the tidal amplitude was 0 5 m the difference between high tide and low tide for a salt concentration of 0 9 became larger with elapsed time and was 0 21 m at 30 days similarly when the tidal amplitude was 1 0 m the difference between high and low tide for a salt concentration of 0 9 initially increased but after an elapsed time of 9 days the difference became smaller with elapsed time at an elapsed time of 30 days the difference was 0 10 m much smaller than that when the tidal amplitude was 0 5 m however at high tide the depth from the water level to the elevation with a salt concentration of 0 9 was slightly deeper when the tidal amplitude was 1 0 m than when the tidal amplitude was 0 5 m in contrast when the tidal amplitude was 2 0 m the depth from the water level to the elevation of a salt concentration of 0 9 increased to 0 89 m and was much deeper than that at tidal amplitudes of 0 5 m and 1 0 m subsequently the depth decreased with elapsed time to 0 08 m at an elapsed time of 30 days when the beach gradient was 1 10 and the amplitude was 2 0 m the difference in the depth from the water level to the elevation of a salt concentration of 0 9 between high and low tide reached a maximum of 0 79 m fig 7a when the tidal amplitude was 0 5 m and 1 0 m the depth from the water level to the elevation of a salt concentration of 0 1 did not exceed 0 18 m and was 1 15 to 1 3 the depth respectively for a salt concentration of 0 9 the differences between high tide and low tide were smaller for a salt concentration of 0 1 than for a salt concentration of 0 9 when the amplitude was 2 0 m the depth from the water level to the elevation of a salt concentration of 0 1 decreased with elapsed time and approached zero just before the elapsed time of 30 days fig 7b therefore the thicknesses of the brackish mixed seawater and freshwater layer decreased as tidal amplitude increased and was not 0 33 m at an elapsed time 30 days the freshwater layer was thinner than the brackish layer its maximum thickness was 1 4 the thickness of the brackish layer in addition the layers were thicker at high tide than at low tide consequently when the beach gradient was 1 10 a thin freshwater layer and brackish layer where seawater and freshwater were mixed formed within the surface seawater at the same time as seawater recirculation was occurring just below the onshore beach surface and the thicknesses of each layer depended on the tidal water level when the tidal amplitude was 0 5 m and 1 0 m and the beach gradient was 1 10 recirculation of seawater appeared below the landward beach slope at an elapsed time of 9 days to 12 days and subsequently became deeper with elapsed time the maximum depth of the recirculation eventually reached 9 9 m when the amplitude was 0 5 m and 11 2 m when it was 1 0 m figs 5j k m and n and fig 6 therefore when the beach gradient was 1 10 the recirculation of seawater in a porous medium just below the onshore beach slope became both broader and deeper as the tidal amplitude increased however when the tidal amplitude was 1 0 m the seawater recirculation appeared at a slightly later elapsed time than when the amplitude was 0 5 m figs 5 g and h and fig 6 hence for tidal amplitudes not exceeding 1 0 m no relationship was found between tidal amplitude and the elapsed time at which recirculation appeared however when the beach gradient was 1 10 the recirculation of seawater occurred earlier and was greater when the tidal amplitude was 2 0 m than when it was 0 5 m or 1 0 m figs 5c f i l and o and fig 6 although the depth of the seawater recirculation below the onshore beach increased with tidal amplitude when the beach gradient was 1 10 the difference in depth was slight when the amplitude did not exceed 1 0 m furthermore before an elapsed time of about 19 days when the tidal amplitude was 1 0 m the recirculation was narrower than when the amplitude was 0 5 m whereas after that time the recirculation was wider at an amplitude of 1 0 than at an amplitude of 0 5 m at the elapsed time of 30 days the recirculation widths at amplitudes of 0 5 m and 1 0 m were 18 m and 20 m respectively when the tidal amplitude was 2 0 m the width and depth of the recirculation of seawater were 28 5 m and 21 6 m respectively thus at this amplitude the recirculation width and depth were both much greater than those at amplitudes of 0 5 m or 1 0 m hence when the beach gradient was 1 10 the seawater recirculation width also depended on the tidal amplitude moreover at this beach gradient the seawater recirculation width was greater than its depth in every case fig 6 when the beach gradient was 1 5 no seawater recirculation appeared below the onshore beach surface when the tidal amplitude was 1 m even at the elapsed time of 30 days fig 8i unlike the case when the beach gradient was 1 10 however a thin freshwater layer and a brackish water layer occurred at this tidal amplitude in the surface seawater fig 9 as they did when the beach gradient was 1 10 when the beach gradient was 1 5 and the tidal amplitude was 1 0 m both the depth from the top of the surface water to the elevation of a salt concentration of 0 9 and that from the top of the surface water to the elevation of a salt concentration of 0 1 were deeper at high tide than at low tide fig 9 furthermore the depth from the top of the surface water to the elevation of a salt concentration of 0 1 increased with elapsed time at both high and low tide and the difference between the distance at high tide and that at low tide ranged from 0 07 to 0 22 m fig 9b at an elapsed time 30 days the depth was 0 26 m at high tide and 0 04 m at low tide fig 9b in contrast at 30 days elapsed time the depth from the top of the surface water to the elevation of a salt concentration of 0 9 was 0 58 m at high tide and 0 40 m at low tide hence there was little freshwater above the seawater when the tidal amplitude was 1 0 because after an elapsed time of 29 50 days the depth from the top of the surface water to the elevation of a salt concentration of 0 1 was not mostly 0 1 m at low tide in contrast when the tide was high there was a thin freshwater layer with a thickness of about 0 26 m and a dilute brackish layer with a thickness of about 0 32 m overlying the surface seawater fig 9 when the beach gradient was 1 5 and the tidal amplitude was 2 m recirculation of seawater occurred early in the porous medium below the onshore beach surface and became both broader and deeper with elapsed time similar to when the beach gradient was 1 10 the maximum depth of seawater recirculation as the elapse time of 30 day reached 21 3 m below the beach surface about 3 m shallower than that when the beach gradient was 1 10 figs 8b d f h and j and fig 10 the width and depth of the seawater recirculation both increased suddenly to 9 0 m and 4 3 m respectively from 1 24 to 1 3 days elapsed time subsequently the depth increased gradually with elapsed time whereas the width first increased gradually with elapsed time and then became approximately constant at 15 8 m at the elapsed time of 30 days the width when the gradient was 1 5 was 10 7 m smaller than the width when the gradient was 1 10 and the depth when the gradient was 1 5 was also smaller than that when the gradient was 1 10 therefore the width and depth of the seawater recirculation were both negatively related to the beach gradient and positively related to the tidal amplitude consequently recirculation of seawater cannot occur when the beach gradient is steeper than 1 5 and the tidal amplitude does not exceed 1 0 m fig 10 the depth from the top of the surface water to the elevation of a salt concentration of 0 9 was deeper at high tide than at low tide until the elapsed time reached 22 days 528 days similar to when the amplitude was 1 0 m and the gradient was 1 5 however after about 22 days the depth at high tide was shallower than that at low tide fig 9a similarly the depth from the top of the surface water to the elevation of a salt concentration of 0 1 was deeper at high tide than at low tide until the elapsed time reached 23 days 552 days but after that time the depth at both high tide and low tide ranged from 0 0 to 0 01 m fig 9b when the tide was low the depth from the top of the surface water to the elevation of a salt concentration of 0 9 increased gently from 0 25 m to 0 30 m until 16 days and thereafter became constant at about 0 3 m however when the tide was high the depth from the top of the surface water to the elevation of a salt concentration of 0 9 decreased with elapsed time from about 0 9 m to 0 07 m at an elapsed time of 30 days in contrast the depth from the top of the surface water to the elevation of a salt concentration of 0 1 was always close to zero at low tide at high tide it decreased from about 0 15 m to 0 02 m at an elapsed time of 19 days and thereafter was near zero therefore when the beach gradient was 1 5 there was little freshwater salt concentration 0 1 after 18 days elapsed time at both low and high tide whereas the brackish water layer salt concentration 0 1 to 0 9 overlying the seawater was 0 07 m thick at high tide and 0 30 m thick at low tide at an elapsed time of 30 days fig 9 when the beach gradient was 1 5 and the tidal amplitude was 2 0 m the aspect ratio that is the ratio of the width to the depth of the seawater recirculation in the porous medium increased drastically from 0 to 1 95 from 0 7 day to 1 day elapsed time thereafter the aspect ratio decreased gradually to 0 74 18 by 30 days elapsed time fig 11 similarly when the gradient was 1 10 and the amplitude was 2 0 m the aspect ratio increased from 0 7 day to 1 day and then gently decreased but at 30 days elapsed time it was still 1 0 however when the beach gradient was 1 10 the aspect ratio was 3 3 near the beginning of the seawater recirculation when the amplitude was 0 5 m whereas when the tidal amplitude was 1 0 m the aspect ratio increased until the elapsed time reached 24 days and then decreased gently recall that at this gradient seawater recirculation appeared 9 days later at tidal amplitudes of 0 5 m and 1 0 m than at a tidal amplitude of 2 0 m at tidal amplitudes of both 0 5 m and 1 0 m the aspect ratio was about 1 77 at an elapsed time of 30 days 0 69 greater than that when the amplitude was 2 0 m fig 11 thus the aspect ratio of the seawater recirculation depended on the tidal amplitude when the tidal amplitude was 1 0 and also depended on the beach gradient except when the tidal amplitude was 1 0 m the aspect ratio tended to be lower when the beach gradient was lower and the tidal amplitude was higher when the beach gradient was 1 10 and the tide was high the water level at x 181 m at the foot of the slope was mostly less than or approximately equal to that at x 201 m but occasionally the water level at x 181 m exceeded that at x 201 m fig 12 the maximum difference in water level between x 181 m and x 201 m at high tide was 0 043 m when the water level at x 181 m was higher than that at x 201 m and it was 0 120 m when the water level at x 201 m was higher than that at x 181 m the water level at x 181 m was often below the water level at x 201 m and the difference between the water levels at x 181 m and x 201 m at high tide became greater with elapsed time fig 12a in contrast at low tide the water level at x 181 m never exceeded that at x 201 m rather the water level at x 181 m was approximately equal to or often lower than that at x 201 m as at high tide the difference between the water level at x 181 m and that at x 201 m became gradually smaller with elapsed time at low tide however the maximum difference in the water level between x 181 m and x 201 m at low tide was 0 044 m smaller than the maximum difference of 0 120 m at high tide at low tide the water level at x 181 m dropped less from that at x 201 m than it did at high tide on the whole the water level drop at x 181 m when the tidal amplitude was 0 5 m was similar to that when the amplitude was 1 and 2 m before the elapsed time of 15 days at high tide and at about 18 days elapsed time at low tide subsequently however the drop at x 181 m when the amplitude was 0 5 m became smaller than that when the amplitude was 1 and 2 m the drop at x 181 m when the tidal amplitude was 1 0 m was similar to that when the amplitude was 2 0 m fig 12 thus when the beach gradient was 1 10 the surface water seawater level was not consistent with the tidal water level imposed at the right boundary x 201 m and varied slightly under the influence of water flow in the surface water and gas flow in the atmosphere the surface water level often dropped and the magnitude of the water level drop at high tide was three times that at low tide similarly when the beach gradient was 1 5 the water level at x 181 m rarely exceeded that at x 201 m at high tide and at low tide it exceeded that at x 201 m except the elapsed time of 25 days furthermore at both low and high tide the water level at x 181 m often dropped from the water level at x 201 m the maximum water level drop at x 181 m i e the water level at x 181 m minus that at x 201 m was 0 122 m at high tide and 0 056 m at low tide these maximum drops were similar to those when the beach gradient was 1 10 the water level drop at high tide occasionally exceeded 0 05 cm when the amplitude was 1 0 m but when the amplitude was 2 0 m it was never 0 05 m at low tide the water level drop at x 181 m did not seem to depend on tidal amplitude the water level often dropped whether the beach gradient was 1 5 or 1 10 and the water level at x 181 m was in most cases approximately equal to that at x 201 m the water level when the beach gradient was 1 5 also varied slightly and was not consistent with the tidal water level which was the water level at x 201 m fig 13 when the beach gradient was 1 10 and the tidal amplitude was 2 0 m the surface water seawater level at high tide was about 1 0 m higher than the water level in the porous medium consequently at high tide both the surface water flow and the water flow in the porous medium were mainly in the landward direction and the maximum flow velocity was 4 10 4 m s in the porous medium and 0 5 m s in the surface seawater on the seaward side of the shoreline the water flow was landward in the porous medium and just below the top of the surface water some water flows were upward or downward in the surface seawater because these water flows below the water surface raised or lowered the surface water level the surface water level varied slightly from the tidal water level imposed at the right boundary x 201 m when the tide was high fig 14a in contrast at low tide water saturation was slightly decreased in the porous medium and the water flow in the porous medium directly under the shoreline was radial with a maximum velocity of 1 10 4 m s the water flows in the porous medium were mainly seaward under the offshore slope and landward under the onshore slope because of the seawater recirculation the water flowing in the porous medium landward of the shoreline and the seawater flowing on the landward beach surface did not discharge into the surface water but infiltrated into the porous medium furthermore the surface water flowed uniformly seaward at low tide as a result at low tide when the beach gradient was 1 10 the surface water level did not vary significantly from the water level at x 201 m fig 14b even when the beach gradient was 1 10 and the tidal amplitude was 0 5 m fig 15 there was seawater on the surface of the beach landward of the shoreline that infiltrated into the porous medium at low tide this seawater flowed radially with a maximum velocity 2 10 5 m s into the porous medium whereas water in the porous medium under the seaward slope of the beach flowed seaward fig 15b at high tide the seawater on the beach surface landward of the shoreline infiltrated radially into the porous medium with a maximum velocity of 2 10 5 m s and subsequently flowed offshore as it did at low tide however different from when the tidal amplitude was 2 m the surface water level at high tide was significantly lower than the level at which the water saturation in the porous medium was 1 0 unlike when the amplitude was 2 0 m the direction of the water flow mostly did not vary but approximately paralleled the surface water level consequently the surface water level varied much less when the tidal amplitude was 0 5 m than it did when the amplitude was 2 0 m fig 15a at both low and high tide when the beach gradient was 1 10 and the tidal amplitude was 0 5 m water infiltrated into the porous medium as described above and was discharged into the surface water around the shoreline fig 15 in contrast at high tide when the amplitude was 2 0 m the water overlying the porous medium seaward of the shoreline flowed into the porous medium as described above because the surface water level was higher than the level where the water saturation in the porous medium was 1 0 fig 14 at all tidal amplitudes the edge of the saltwater in the porous medium at low tide was located directly under the shoreline figs 5 8 14 and 15 when the beach gradient was 1 10 the region at the top of the porous medium with s w 1 0 extended slightly farther seaward at low tide than it did at high tide at all tidal amplitudes however when the beach gradient was 1 5 the region at the top of the porous medium with s w 1 0 extended considerably farther seaward at low tide than at high tide at this tidal amplitude the water flow in the porous medium directly under the shoreline was seaward with velocity of 8 10 5 m s thus the seawater did not remain in the porous medium directly under the shoreline consequently no recirculation of seawater occurred in the porous medium when the beach gradient was 1 5 and the tidal amplitude was 1 0 m figs 14 15 and 16 the velocity vectors of water flow on and directly under the surface of the porous medium was often in the direction of the seawater especially at low tide the water pressure in the surface system varied slightly because of gas flow in the atmosphere as a result water saturation at the surface of the porous medium varied the variation in water velocity at the surface of the porous medium might be caused by this variation of water saturation although gas flow in the atmosphere should affect the water flow in the porous medium it would influence only the shallow water flow close to the surface of the porous medium thus the gas pressure and gas flow cannot significantly influence the saltwater wedge and the recirculation of seawater deeper than the seawater level 5 conclusion i previously developed a numerical simulation method called the asgmf method for reproducing gas flow and gas pressure in the atmosphere and a porous medium and water flow and water pressure in surface water and a porous medium asgmf also couples the water pressure and water flow in a porous medium with those in the surface water and can simulate variable density flow and the salt concentration distribution in the porous medium and the surface water in this study the results of numerical simulations with asgmf showed that the recirculation of seawater depends on the tidal amplitude and is greater when the amplitude exceeds 1 0 m but also that it is unlikely to occur when the beach gradient is steep in these simulations the aspect ratio width depth of the seawater recirculation initially increased drastically to 1 0 but thereafter decreased to 1 0 when the tidal amplitude exceeded 1 0 m and to 2 0 when the tidal amplitude was 1 0 m thus when the tidal amplitude was 1 0 m the aspect ratio of the seawater recirculation depended on the tidal amplitude decreasing as the tidal amplitude increased furthermore although the surface water level was equal to the tidal water level in many cases it was sometimes lower than the tidal water level when the tidal amplitude was 1 0 m this drop in the surface water level was significant because water flowed upward or downward in the surface water below the water surface level thus when the beach gradient was both 1 10 and 1 5 the surface water level was not consistent with the tidal water level imposed at the right boundary but varied slightly because of the influence of water flow in the surface water and gas flow in the atmosphere the thickness of the layer of mixed freshwater and seawater in the surface water decreased with tidal amplitude the freshwater layer was thin reaching a maximum of 1 4 the thickness of the brackish mixed layer in addition the thicknesses of both the freshwater layer and the brackish layer were greater at high tide than at low tide consequently when the beach gradient was 1 10 a thin freshwater layer and a mixed freshwater and saltwater layer formed in the surface seawater when seawater recirculation was occurring in the porous medium landward of the shoreline the thicknesses of these layers depended on the tidal water level when the beach gradient was 1 5 after an elapsed time of 18 days there was little freshwater at both low and high tide and at an elapsed time of 30 days only a brackish mixed layer 0 07 m thick at high tide and 0 30 m thick at low tide was present above the seawater therefore the salt concentration in the surface water often differed from the seawater salt concentration because a thin freshwater layer and brackish layer of mixed freshwater and saltwater occurred above the seawater in actual surface seawater near a coast the water flow is not caused only by tidal forcing but can also be influenced by wave action as shown in figs 15 and 16 seawater circulated in the surface seawater and flowed parallel to the top of the surface seawater level because the density of freshwater is less than that of seawater the freshwater discharged to outside the porous medium was transferred by this circulation and flow and it occurred above the seawater and beneath the surface of the surface seawater however when the beach gradient was 1 10 and the tidal amplitude was 2 0 m water flow in the surface seawater was not parallel to the surface and the flow direction went up or down because the difference in water level between low tide and high tide was greater than at other title amplitude as shown in fig 14a further in this case the surface seawater level would not remain constant rather small waves formed in the surface seawater as a result the layer with a salt concentration of 0 0 to 0 1 would become thinner with elapsed time and finally disappear from the surface seawater figs 9 and 14a thus as a result of wave action there might be only a thin mixed zone with a salt concentration between 0 1 and 1 0 all numerical simulations conducted in this study were ended at an elapsed time of 30 days however ideally the numerical simulations would be continued until gas and water flows reached a steady state in the porous medium the surface water and the atmosphere in the future the asgmf numerical simulation method will be improved by further parallelization with mpi to allow simulations of seawater recirculation to be conducted up to an elapsed time of 360 days author statement

1252,many studies have used numerical simulations and experiments to simulate saltwater intrusion in a nearshore aquifer thus it is known that seawater recirculation occurs in a porous medium just below a sloping beach and a saltwater wedge occurs in the medium below where the slope intersects the water level at low tide this study investigated the salt distribution in the surface water when subterranean recirculation of seawater is occurring and there is a saltwater wedge in an underlying porous medium along with the relationships between the seawater recirculation and the tidal amplitude and beach gradient the salt distribution in a subterranean aquifer and in surface seawater where the shore sloped gently seaward with a constant slope of 1 10 or 1 5 under tidal amplitudes of 0 5 1 0 or 2 0 m was numerically simulated by the asgmf method which couples water pressure and water flow in a porous medium with those in the overlying surface water and can simulate variable density flows and the salt concentration distribution in both the porous medium and the surface water the results showed that the recirculation of seawater depended on the tidal amplitude being greater when the amplitude exceeded 1 0 m but that it was unlikely to occur when the beach gradient was steep thus the aspect ratio width to depth of the seawater recirculation decreased as the tidal amplitude increased above 1 0 m furthermore the simulated surface water level was often lower than the tidal water level thus the surface water level was not consistent with the tidal water level imposed at the right boundary of the simulation domain but varied slightly under the influence of water flow in the surface water and gas flow in the atmosphere the salt concentration in the surface water was not always the same as the seawater salt concentration because a thin freshwater layer and a brackish water layer of mixed freshwater and saltwater overlay the seawater keywords recirculation saltwater wedge salt intrusion variable density flow advection dispersion equation multiphase flow 1 introduction many studies have numerically simulated saltwater intrusion in a nearshore aquifer these numerical simulations can be classified according to the outside oceanic forcing considered 1 constant seawater level 2 tidal forcing 3 wave forcing and 4 a combination of wave and tide forcing numerical simulations of a saltwater wedge in a porous medium under a constant seawater level are classic examples e g langevin et al 2010 lin et al 2009 lu et al 2013 2015 nishikawa et al 2009 pool and carrera 2010 webb and howard 2011 these numerical simulations represented only the saltwater wedge in a porous medium by using darcy s law a mass conservation equation with variable density flow and an advection dispersion equation for salt migration in the water phase of the porous medium thus they targeted only the porous medium however tides and waves cause nearshore seawater levels to fluctuate and these oceanic forces can influence subterranean saltwater migration around the shoreline accordingly elad et al 2017 and guo et al 2019 conducted numerical simulations of seawater flow in a subterranean coastal aquifer forced by tidal fluctuations by using only darcy s law and the advection dispersion equation for porous media robinson et al 2007a goswami and clement 2007b numerically simulated subterranean seawater recirculation beneath an onshore beach surface and the main subterranean saltwater wedge due to tidal fluctuation by treating the seawater domain as a saturated highly permeable porous medium porosity 1 0 with a high hydraulic conductivity 106 m d filled with saltwater with a salt concentration of 35 ppt where the upper surface of the seawater domain fluctuated according to a specific tidal amplitude and period robinson et al 2007a 2007b employed only darcy s law with variable density flow combined with an advection dispersion equation for a porous medium saturated with water they did not rigorously solve water flows and salt migration in the seawater xin et al 2010 robinson et al 2014 and yang et al 2013 used the empirical formula of nielsen 2009 and depth averaged shallow water equations hibberd and peregrine 1979 li et al 2002 or the diffusive wave equation viessman and lewis 1996 to represent fluctuations of the seawater surface elevation due to waves and tides however these simulations could not represent water flow and salt transport in the seawater because these methods treat water pressure in the seawater as hydrostatic instead like robinson et al 2007a 2007b they treated the seawater region as a highly permeable porous medium with a constant salt concentration bakhtyar et al 2011 represented waves and tides by using a k ε turbulence closure model based on the navier stokes equations and the volume of fluid method hirt and nichols 1981 lopez de bertodano et al 1994 to simulate two phase gas water flow and migration interfaces between gas and water however even though this method can calculate water flow and water pressure under non hydrostatic conditions to simulate salt transport they treated the seawater region as a fictitious porous medium with very high permeability and did not use the calculated non hydrostatic water pressure and water flow moreover xin et al 2010 and robinson et al 2014 like robinson et al 2007a 2007b conducted simulations for only a porous medium saturated with water and not an unsaturated porous medium in contrast hibi 2020 developed a numerical simulation method that combines seawater flow with subterranean water flow and can reproduce salt transport in both the nearshore seawater and groundwater furthermore hibi 2020 confirmed that the results obtained with the developed numerical simulation method were consistent with experimental results obtained in a tank in which both surface seawater and a subterranean estuary in a porous medium compacted sand were reproduced in these tank experiments freshwater infiltrated the sand from the side of the tank opposite the seawater side and a saltwater wedge eventually formed in the porous medium around the shoreline although as indicated above robinson et al 2007a 2007b xin et al 2010 bakhtyar et al 2011 and robinson et al 2014 could perfectly reproduce the subterranean recirculation of seawater just below an onshore surface and the main seawater wedge in a porous medium around a shoreline caused by tides and waves they did not verify their assumption that the nearshore seawater salt concentration is always constant either experimentally or by numerical simulation this study however conducted numerical simulations for reproducing the recirculation and circulation the saltwater wedge of seawater in a porous medium and surface water caused by tides with analytical domains consisting of a porous medium surface water and atmosphere no numerical simulations considering water flow and the migration of salt in the surface water have been carried out previously under tidal fluctuation accordingly by using the atmosphere surface water groundwater multi flow asgmf method this study investigated the salt distribution in surface seawater with consideration of the water flow and the salt migration in surface water when subterranean seawater recirculation is occurring and there is a main seawater wedge onshore and around the shoreline further it examined the relationships between the recirculation of seawater and the tidal amplitude and between the recirculation of seawater and the beach gradient thus the salt distribution in a subterranean aquifer and in the nearshore seawater under oceanic forcing by tides where the shore sloped gently seaward with a constant slope 1 10 or 1 5 was simulated by using the numerical simulation method developed by the author 2 numerical simulation theory and procedure 2 1 theory fluid flows in surface water and a porous medium can be rigorously solved by applying navier stokes equations and employing a multiphase flow numerical technique that considers water retention in the porous medium hibi and tomigashi 2015 2018 hibi et al 2015 and hibi 2020 have developed a numerical simulation method the asgmf method that employs a one field model for multiple immiscible fluids to simulate surface water flow and water saturation equations to simulate groundwater flows by considering the mass conservation law together with incompressibility navier stokes equations are solved by a semi lagrange method with cubic interpolated

van genuchten parameters and γ 1 1 β by substituting p g t δt p w t δt p cgw t into p t δt f w t p w t δt f g t p g t δt we obtain p t δt f w t f g t p w t δt f g t p cgw t where p g t δt and p w t δt at each nodal point are gas pressure and water pressure at time t δt respectively next we substitute f w t f g t 1 into p t δt f w t f g t p w t δt f g t p cgw t and then rearrange the result with

advection dispersion equation eq 23 to deal with the transfer of saltwater in the surface water and the water in the porous medium 23 c t v w θ c d ij c where c is the salt concentration in water θ is 1 0 in the surface water or the volumetric water content in the porous medium and d ij is dispersion in the i and j directions as follows 24a d ij d d in surface water 24b d ij τd d α t δ ij δ km α l

system here the position vector r i v w t δt φ δt is specified from v w t δt θ and v w t δt obtained by eqs 2 and 21a and c is c at r i v w t δt φ δt in the solute concentration field at time t then the distribution of c t δt is obtained by interpolating with cip for c and the backward difference method for time as follows 25 1 δ t c t δ t d ij c t δ t 1 δ t c finally eq 25 is discretized by using the galerkin finite element method fem asgmf handles variable density flows in a porous medium and surface water flow by using eq 26 because seawater is heavier than freshwater 26 ρ w ρ w freshwater c ρ w seawater ρ w freshwater c seawater where ρ w freshwater is the density of freshwater ρ w seawater is the density of seawater and c seawater is the salt concentration in the original seawater 2 2 procedure by discretizing eq 1 the analytical domain by the galerkin fem we obtain the following algebraic equation 27 1 ρ t j 1 n v n i n j dv p j t δ t q i v n i dv g 1 δ t j 1 n v n i n j dv v j i 1 to n where n is the number of nodal points v is the volume of the analytical domain p j t δt is the pressure of the fluid at nodal point j at the elapsed time t δt v j is the fluid velocity at the position vector r j v t δt at the elapsed time t n i and n j are the shape function at the nodal points i and j respectively and ρ t is the average value of fluid density in an element the fluid velocity v t j 1 at the position vector r j v t j δt is first obtained by interpolation from the distribution of velocity at the elapsed time t to obtain v t in the position vector r j v t δt at the nodal point j here v t j is the velocity at the nodal point j at the elapsed time t second the fluid velocity v t j 2 is obtained at the position vector r j v t j 1 δt in the velocity field at the elapsed time t finally v t at the nodal point j is equal to the fluid velocity at the position vector r j v t j 1 v t j 2 δt 2 in the velocity field at the elapsed time t in addition q i is defined as follows 28 q i 1 ρ t j 1 n ω n i n j p j t δ t ρ t g n dω i 1 to n here ω is the perimeter of the analytical domain eq 27 must be simultaneously solved with the discretized eq 13 for the fluid pressure in the porous medium however the discrepancy between the gas pressure in the atmosphere and the synthetic pressure in the porous medium at the porous medium surface facing the atmosphere has to be considered in eq 13 the gas pressure in the atmosphere should be equal to that in a porous medium unsaturated with water however the synthetic pressure includes the water pressure multiplied by f w see eq 8 the synthetic pressure in the porous medium becomes similar to the atmospheric pressure because f w approaches zero as the water saturation becomes closer to zero as the water saturation in the porous medium approaches 1 0 however the synthetic pressure is different from the atmospheric pressure because f w increases to 1 0 with the water saturation this difference is equal to f w p cwg which can be obtained by eq 8 considering that p cgw p g po p w po and f n f g 1 as follows 29 p f w p w po f g p g po p g po f w p cwg eq 29 shows that the synthetic pressure is lower than the gas pressure in the porous medium as stated above the gas pressure in the porous medium equals the atmospheric pressure consequently the synthetic pressure should be lower than the atmospheric pressure at the surface by f w p cwg fig 1 by considering this difference f w p cwg at the surface eq 13 can be changed as follows 30 λ t k s p t δ t λ t k s p c t χ f w t p cwg t λ t k s f w t ρ w f g t ρ g g where p cwg t is the capillary pressure at the elapsed time t and χ is 1 0 at one nodal point on the surface and 0 at another nodal point eq 30 can be discretized over the analytical domain by the fem as follows 31 j 1 n λ t k s v n i n j d v p j t δ t q i j 1 n λ t p cgw t k s v n i n j d v f g j t j 1 n λ t k s χ v n i n j d v f wj t p cgwj t λ t k s f w t ρ w f g t ρ

respectively at the elapsed time t λ t f g t p cgw t and f w t are the average of λ t f g t p cgw and f w t respectively in an element at the elapsed time t furthermore q i in eq 30 describes the outflow or inflow volume of fluid at nodal point i on a boundary of the analytical domain 32 q i j 1 n λ t k s ω n i n j p j t δ t χ f wj t p cgwj t p cgw t n j f g j t f w t ρ w f g t ρ g g n dω i 1 to n then the algebraic equations eqs 27 and 31 for the fluid pressure in the surface system and the porous medium are solved simultaneously with consideration of the initial and boundary conditions for the fluid pressure by the gauss seidel method or the successive overrelaxation sor method the velocity of fluid at each nodal point in the surface system can be obtained from the pressure of fluid in the surface system with algebraic equations derived from eq 2 by the galerkin fem as follows 33 v n i d v v i t δ t μ t ρ t δ t j 1 n v n i n j d v v j t δ t v n i d v v i δ t ρ t j 1 n v n i n j d v p j t δ t v n i d v g δ t ρ t τ i i 1 to n where v i t δt and v j t δt are the fluid velocities at nodal points i and j respectively at the elapsed time t δt μ t is the average viscosity obtained by eq 4 p j t is the pressure of fluid at the nodal point j at the elapsed time t which has already been obtained by eqs 27 and 31 when this equation is solved in addition τ i in eq 33 is the shear force on the boundary of the analytical domain which is defined as follows 34 τ i μ t j 1 n ω n i n j n dω v j t δ t i 1 to n algebraic equations can be derived from eq 14 by discretization in the analytical domain with the galerkin fem by considering the difference f w p cwg as follows 35 v n i d v v t i t δ t j 1 n λ t k s v n i n j d v p j t δ t χ f wj t p cgwj t p cgw t v n i n j d v f g j t f w t ρ w f g t ρ g v n i d v g i 1 to n thus the total flow velocity at the elapsed time t δt at nodal point i in the porous medium v t i t δt can be obtained by using only the equation stated above however for the present problem it is necessary to consider interaction between fluid flows in the porous medium and the surface system at the boundary between the two regions accordingly eq 33 and eq 35 are simultaneously solved by using the gauss seidel method the sor method or the preconditioned conjugate gradient method in this case because eq 33 and eq 35 are employed in some elements on the surface system side and on the porous medium side respectively of a nodal point on the boundary between the porous medium and the surface system the interaction of the fluid flows in the two regions can be considered at the nodal point on the boundary between the two regions the void fraction of water s w at each nodal point in the surface water is obtained with eq 5 and the position vector can be computed using the fluid velocity obtained with eqs 33 and 35 however the total flow velocity obtained with eqs 33 and 35 cannot simply be used to migrate water saturation s w in the porous medium as in the surface system in the porous medium apparent velocity v soil t and the dispersion coefficient d soil t determined with eq 16 are needed at any nodal point in the porous medium for the water saturation migration hence df g ds w t dλ ds w t κ and dp cgw ds w t in eq 16 must be calculated at each nodal point from the water saturation obtained in the previous time step further v soil t and d soil t in eq 16 are computed using the total flow velocity and synthetic pressure values already obtained these v soil t and d soil t values are substituted into the algebraic equations obtained by discretizing eq 15 over the analytical domain with the galerkin fem as follows 36 v n i d v s w i t δ t δ t j 1 n d soil t v n i n j d v s w j t δ t δ t q w i v n i d v s w i i 1 to n where s w i t δt and s w j t δt are the water saturation at nodal points i and j respectively at the elapsed time t δt d soil t is the average of d soil in an element and s w i is the water saturation at r i v soil t δt in the water saturation field at the elapsed time t first v soil t i obtained at any nodal point i by using eq 16a is employed to decide v soil t in the position vector r i v soil t δt next v soil t i at the position r i v soil t i δt decided with v soil t i is obtained by interpolating with cip finally the position for interpolation of s w i is decided by r i v soil t i v soil t i δt 2 in addition q w i in eq 36 is defined as follows 37 q w i j 1 n d soil t ω n i n j s w j t δ t n dω i 1 to n water velocity in the porous medium and the surface water are needed to calculate the advection of the salt concentration in water the water velocity in the surface water has already been obtained by using eq 33 but only the total velocity in the porous medium has been obtained by eq 35 the water velocity at each nodal point in the porous medium including on the surface should be calculated with eq 20 using the synthetic pressure obtained by eq 31 and the capillary pressure between water and gas and f g t i at the nodal point i the position interpolating the salt concentration c i at the nodal point i by advection is consistent with r i v w i t δt v w i t δt 2φ δt where v w i t δt is the water velocity at the nodal point i obtained by eq 21 and v w i t δt is the water velocity at the position vector r i v w i t δt φ δt obtained by interpolation in the water velocity field at the elapsed time t δt then eq 25 is discretized over the analytical domain by using the galerkin fem as follows 38 v n i d v c i t δ t δ t j 1 n d i j v n i n j d v c j t δ t δ t q c i v n i d v c i i 1 to n where c i t δt and c j t δt are the salt concentration at nodal points i and j respectively at the elapsed time t δt d i j is the average of d i j which is the dispersion coefficient in an element in the i and j directions of the coordinate as shown in eq 24 further q c i in eq 38 is defined as follows 39 q c i j 1 n d i j ω n i n j c j t δ t n dω i 1 to n the salt concentration at each nodal point obtained by eq 38 is used to calculate the density of water at each nodal point with eq 26 further the relative permeabilities of the groundwater and the gas at each nodal point are calculated by eq 18 with the water saturation obtained as described above and these relative permeabilities are used to obtain λ t f g t and f w t at each nodal point the p cgw at each nodal point is calculated from the water saturation with eq 19 the intrusion recirculation and circulation of saltwater in the porous medium and surface seawater for seawater of various densities should depend on the density of seawater and is a nonlinear problem thus after completing the above calculations for one time step some iteration method inherently has to be used to solve this problem however an iteration method is not employed in the present numerical simulations with asgmf because the time increment δt was very short at 0 05 0 1 s the total velocity in the porous medium and the fluid velocity in the surface system obtained above are used to get the interpolation position of v at the next time step and the synthetic pressure and the fluid pressure at the next time step are obtained with eq 27 and 31 the total velocity the fluid velocity the water saturation and the void fraction of water and the salt concentration are calculated sequentially as described above asgmf repeats these calculations until the elapsed time reaches the maximum time fig 2 hibi 2020 has evaluated the accuracy of asgmf by comparing the results between two dimensional experiments and numerical simulations first results for transient variable density flow in only a porous medium unsaturated with water were compared between tank experiments conducted by goswami and clement 2007 and numerical simulations goswami and clement 2007 put compacted silica sand into a two dimensional plexiglas tank with a length of 53 cm a height of 30 5 cm and a width of 2 7 cm along with freshwater density 1 000 g cm3 and seawater density 1 026 g cm3 the compacted silica sand had an intrinsic permeability of 1 34 10 9 m2 a porosity of 0 385 a longitudinal dispersivity of 0 001 m and a transverse dispersivity of 0 0001 m the tank had a seawater reservoir on its left side and a freshwater reservoir on its right side the seawater level in the seawater reservoir was kept constant at a height of 25 5 cm from the bottom of the tank but the freshwater level in the freshwater reservoir was varied from a height of 26 7 cm to 26 2 cm and from a height of 26 2 cm to 26 55 cm above the bottom of the tank thus the flow in the porous medium in the tank was consistent with transient variable density flow without surface water flow the salt concentration distribution reproduced by numerical simulations of these tank experiments with asgmf was consistent with the experimental distribution in all cases consequently hibi 2020 verified that asgmf could accurately reproduce the salt concentration distribution caused by variable flow and salt transport in a porous medium without surface water flow next hibi 2020 conducted experiments in a two dimensional tank length 190 cm height 60 cm width 13 5 cm with two reservoirs each 4 cm long and 13 5 cm wide installed on either side of the tank one for supplying freshwater and the other for supplying saltwater into the tank first seawater was poured into the tank at the height of 35 5 cm from the bottom of the tank second glass beads with average grain size 0 2 mm were compacted into the tank at the height of 0 425 cm from the bottom of the tank at the boundary with the freshwater reservoir and at the height of 0 200 cm from the boundary with the saltwater reservoir thus the surface of the compacted glass beads sloped with a gradient of about 0 124 the compacted glass beads had an intrinsic permeability of 3 60 10 11 m2 a porosity of 0 405 a longitudinal dispersivity of 0 121 m and a transverse dispersivity of 0 0121 m further the saltwater and freshwater densities were 1 024 g cm3 and 1 000 g cm3 respectively at the start time of the experiment there was a layer of saltwater above the surface of the compacted glass beads on the saltwater reservoir side because the initial water level was at a height of 35 5 cm from the bottom of the tank the water level was kept constant at 38 8 cm in the freshwater reservoir and at 35 5 cm in the saltwater reservoir during the experiment as a result a main saltwater wedge developed which after an elapsed time of 20 h was stationary at a horizontal distance of 60 to 75 cm from the freshwater reservoir at this time there was a layer of freshwater with a thickness of 5 9 cm above the surface saltwater layer hibi 2020 simulated this two dimensional tank experiment using asgmf with an analytical domain that included the atmosphere and surface water regions comparison of the results between the numerical simulation and the experiment confirmed that the location and thickness of the main saltwater wedge reproduced by asgmf were similar to those in the experimental results and the thickness of the surface freshwater layer was identical to that in the experiment therefore hibi 2020 confirmed that asgmf could accurately reproduce the saltwater wedge in the porous medium and the surface freshwater layer obtained in the experimental results 3 configuration of models parameters and boundary and initial conditions for numerical simulations in this study numerical simulations were conducted by the asgmf method in the two dimensional vertical domain illustrated in fig 3 to obtain salt concentration distributions in seawater and in a subterranean estuary in the nearshore region in these numerical simulations tidal amplitudes were 0 50 m 1 0 m or 2 0 m and the beach gradient was 1 10 or 1 5 the analytical domain shown in fig 3 is consistent with that used by xin et al 2010 who simulated seawater intrusion into a subterranean estuary by using darcy s law and the mass conservation law with variable density of water and a solute transport equation however in the present study a pool with width 1 m was located at the left end of the domain and filled with water up to z 31 m which was equal to the initial water level thus a water head of 31 m and vertical and horizontal water velocities of 0 m s were imposed from z 0 m to 2 m at the left boundary of the domain fig 3 therefore the water pressure at this boundary was hydrostatic subject to the water level of 31 m the horizontal velocity of water was also zero from z 2 m to 60 m and both horizontal and vertical velocities of water and gas were zero from 32 m to 60 m at the left boundary of the domain in addition at the upper boundary gas pressure was zero and both the vertical and horizontal velocities of gas were zero furthermore the lower boundary of the domain was impermeable and the water level at the right boundary was specified by a series of time variation pressure as follows 40 h z h in a mp cos ω tid t where h z and h in are the water level at elapsed time t and the initial water level z 31 00 m at the right boundary respectively a mp and ω tid are the tidal amplitude and angular frequency respectively where ω tid is 1 4537 10 4 rad s the tidal water elevations obtained by eq 40 are illustrated in fig 4 for tidal amplitudes of 0 5 1 0 and 2 0 m water pressure at the right domain boundary was hydrostatic when the water level was equal to the value obtained by eq 40 and the gas pressure was static provided that the gas pressure was zero at the upper boundary in addition both horizontal and vertical water velocities of zero were imposed at the right boundary except in the porous medium and the salt concentration was imposed as 1 0 which is equal to the salt concentration of seawater at the right boundary to z not exceeding the water level the void fraction of water and water saturation were 1 0 below the water level and zero above the water level at the right boundary initial water pressure and gas pressure were equal to hydrostatic pressure subject to the initial water level z 31 00 m and static pressure subject to a gas pressure of zero on the upper boundary respectively in addition initial vertical and horizontal velocities of water and gas were both zero everywhere in the domain the initial salt concentration below the initial water level was 1 0 from x 151 m to 201 m and 0 0 from x 0 0 m to 151 m the initial void fraction of water and water saturation were 1 0 below the water level in both the surface water and the porous medium and the initial water saturation in the porous medium above the water level was calculated using the capillary pressure and the van genuchten equation van genuchten 1980 as follows 41 s w 1 αp cgw β γ the parameter values used in the present numerical simulations are shown in table 1 porosity the water retention curve and characteristics of dispersion in the porous medium used in these simulations were the same as those used in the simulations implemented by xin et al 2010 and robinson et al 2007a the diffusion coefficient was set to the generally accepted values and tortuosity was not considered in these simulations because values for the diffusion coefficient and tortuosity were not found in xin et al 2010 and robinson et al 2007a the density of seawater used in these simulations is consistent with a salt concentration of 35 ppt the value used in the simulations by xin et al 2010 and robinson et al 2007a and which is equal to a relative salt concentration of 1 0 densities and viscosities of freshwater and gas used in these simulations were approximately those at 20 c the permeability shown in table 1 is 1 55 times greater than that used in the simulations conducted by xin et al 2010 and robison et al 2007a because the computers used in this study do not have enough capability for these complicated numerical simulations if the permeability value used by xin et al 2010 and robinson et al 2007a had been used the computations for the present simulations would have been too time consuming therefore a greater permeability value was used here so that the recirculation of seawater onshore could be reproduced at a relatively early elapsed time 4 numerical simulation results and discussion salt concentration distributions in the porous medium and surface water were examined in simulations conducted to an elapsed time of up to 30 days for each of the three tidal amplitudes and two beach gradients the salt concentration distribution did not reach a steady state within the elapsed time of 30 days although ideally these simulations should be continued until a steady state was reached the computers used in this study cpu ryzen threadripper 3970 3 7ghz 32 cores 64 threads asgmf code parallelized by openmp did not have enough capacity to conduct the simulations to steady state therefore the simulations were terminated at the elapsed time of 30 days because the focus of this study was the salt concentration distribution in the surface water and by the elapsed time of 30 days seawater was beginning to recirculate just below the onshore portion of the beach using all 32 cores and the parallelized asgmf the present simulations required 21 to 28 days to be completed to an elapsed time of 30 days thus the calculation speed was close to one day per elapsed day when the tidal amplitude was 2 m and the beach gradient was 1 10 recirculation of seawater was already occurring below the onshore beach surface to a depth of 8 7 m by the elapsed time of 6 days fig 5c and the maximum depth of the recirculating seawater became deeper with elapsed time finally reaching a depth of 24 8 m similar to about 0 9 of the depth of the offshore thickness of the porous medium of 27 m fig 6 furthermore the slope of the main interface between the freshwater and the seawater the leading edge of the saltwater wedge became gentler as the area of the recirculating seawater expanded figs 5c f i l and o in contrast when the tidal amplitude was 0 5 m or 1 0 m and the beach gradient was 1 10 recirculation of seawater did not occur in the porous medium beneath the onshore beach surface until the elapsed time reached 9 days fig 6 however at the elapsed time of 9 days a freshwater layer 0 salt concentration 0 1 and a brackish layer of mixed freshwater and saltwater 0 1 salt concentration 0 9 were present in the surface water just below the top of the surface water figs 5d and e and fig 7 the freshwater and dilute brackish water layers remained in the surface water from 9 days until the elapsed time of 30 days but just before 30 days the depth of both layers 0 salt concentration 0 9 was 0 14 to 0 35 m below the top of the surface water when the tidal amplitude was 0 5 m and 0 3 to 0 40 m when the amplitude was 1 0 m fig 7a for a beach gradient of 1 10 the depths from the water level to the elevation with a salt concentration of 0 9 at high and low tide are shown in fig 7a and those from the water level to the elevation with a salt concentration of 0 1 at high and low tide are shown in fig 7b when the tidal amplitude was 0 5 m the difference between high tide and low tide for a salt concentration of 0 9 became larger with elapsed time and was 0 21 m at 30 days similarly when the tidal amplitude was 1 0 m the difference between high and low tide for a salt concentration of 0 9 initially increased but after an elapsed time of 9 days the difference became smaller with elapsed time at an elapsed time of 30 days the difference was 0 10 m much smaller than that when the tidal amplitude was 0 5 m however at high tide the depth from the water level to the elevation with a salt concentration of 0 9 was slightly deeper when the tidal amplitude was 1 0 m than when the tidal amplitude was 0 5 m in contrast when the tidal amplitude was 2 0 m the depth from the water level to the elevation of a salt concentration of 0 9 increased to 0 89 m and was much deeper than that at tidal amplitudes of 0 5 m and 1 0 m subsequently the depth decreased with elapsed time to 0 08 m at an elapsed time of 30 days when the beach gradient was 1 10 and the amplitude was 2 0 m the difference in the depth from the water level to the elevation of a salt concentration of 0 9 between high and low tide reached a maximum of 0 79 m fig 7a when the tidal amplitude was 0 5 m and 1 0 m the depth from the water level to the elevation of a salt concentration of 0 1 did not exceed 0 18 m and was 1 15 to 1 3 the depth respectively for a salt concentration of 0 9 the differences between high tide and low tide were smaller for a salt concentration of 0 1 than for a salt concentration of 0 9 when the amplitude was 2 0 m the depth from the water level to the elevation of a salt concentration of 0 1 decreased with elapsed time and approached zero just before the elapsed time of 30 days fig 7b therefore the thicknesses of the brackish mixed seawater and freshwater layer decreased as tidal amplitude increased and was not 0 33 m at an elapsed time 30 days the freshwater layer was thinner than the brackish layer its maximum thickness was 1 4 the thickness of the brackish layer in addition the layers were thicker at high tide than at low tide consequently when the beach gradient was 1 10 a thin freshwater layer and brackish layer where seawater and freshwater were mixed formed within the surface seawater at the same time as seawater recirculation was occurring just below the onshore beach surface and the thicknesses of each layer depended on the tidal water level when the tidal amplitude was 0 5 m and 1 0 m and the beach gradient was 1 10 recirculation of seawater appeared below the landward beach slope at an elapsed time of 9 days to 12 days and subsequently became deeper with elapsed time the maximum depth of the recirculation eventually reached 9 9 m when the amplitude was 0 5 m and 11 2 m when it was 1 0 m figs 5j k m and n and fig 6 therefore when the beach gradient was 1 10 the recirculation of seawater in a porous medium just below the onshore beach slope became both broader and deeper as the tidal amplitude increased however when the tidal amplitude was 1 0 m the seawater recirculation appeared at a slightly later elapsed time than when the amplitude was 0 5 m figs 5 g and h and fig 6 hence for tidal amplitudes not exceeding 1 0 m no relationship was found between tidal amplitude and the elapsed time at which recirculation appeared however when the beach gradient was 1 10 the recirculation of seawater occurred earlier and was greater when the tidal amplitude was 2 0 m than when it was 0 5 m or 1 0 m figs 5c f i l and o and fig 6 although the depth of the seawater recirculation below the onshore beach increased with tidal amplitude when the beach gradient was 1 10 the difference in depth was slight when the amplitude did not exceed 1 0 m furthermore before an elapsed time of about 19 days when the tidal amplitude was 1 0 m the recirculation was narrower than when the amplitude was 0 5 m whereas after that time the recirculation was wider at an amplitude of 1 0 than at an amplitude of 0 5 m at the elapsed time of 30 days the recirculation widths at amplitudes of 0 5 m and 1 0 m were 18 m and 20 m respectively when the tidal amplitude was 2 0 m the width and depth of the recirculation of seawater were 28 5 m and 21 6 m respectively thus at this amplitude the recirculation width and depth were both much greater than those at amplitudes of 0 5 m or 1 0 m hence when the beach gradient was 1 10 the seawater recirculation width also depended on the tidal amplitude moreover at this beach gradient the seawater recirculation width was greater than its depth in every case fig 6 when the beach gradient was 1 5 no seawater recirculation appeared below the onshore beach surface when the tidal amplitude was 1 m even at the elapsed time of 30 days fig 8i unlike the case when the beach gradient was 1 10 however a thin freshwater layer and a brackish water layer occurred at this tidal amplitude in the surface seawater fig 9 as they did when the beach gradient was 1 10 when the beach gradient was 1 5 and the tidal amplitude was 1 0 m both the depth from the top of the surface water to the elevation of a salt concentration of 0 9 and that from the top of the surface water to the elevation of a salt concentration of 0 1 were deeper at high tide than at low tide fig 9 furthermore the depth from the top of the surface water to the elevation of a salt concentration of 0 1 increased with elapsed time at both high and low tide and the difference between the distance at high tide and that at low tide ranged from 0 07 to 0 22 m fig 9b at an elapsed time 30 days the depth was 0 26 m at high tide and 0 04 m at low tide fig 9b in contrast at 30 days elapsed time the depth from the top of the surface water to the elevation of a salt concentration of 0 9 was 0 58 m at high tide and 0 40 m at low tide hence there was little freshwater above the seawater when the tidal amplitude was 1 0 because after an elapsed time of 29 50 days the depth from the top of the surface water to the elevation of a salt concentration of 0 1 was not mostly 0 1 m at low tide in contrast when the tide was high there was a thin freshwater layer with a thickness of about 0 26 m and a dilute brackish layer with a thickness of about 0 32 m overlying the surface seawater fig 9 when the beach gradient was 1 5 and the tidal amplitude was 2 m recirculation of seawater occurred early in the porous medium below the onshore beach surface and became both broader and deeper with elapsed time similar to when the beach gradient was 1 10 the maximum depth of seawater recirculation as the elapse time of 30 day reached 21 3 m below the beach surface about 3 m shallower than that when the beach gradient was 1 10 figs 8b d f h and j and fig 10 the width and depth of the seawater recirculation both increased suddenly to 9 0 m and 4 3 m respectively from 1 24 to 1 3 days elapsed time subsequently the depth increased gradually with elapsed time whereas the width first increased gradually with elapsed time and then became approximately constant at 15 8 m at the elapsed time of 30 days the width when the gradient was 1 5 was 10 7 m smaller than the width when the gradient was 1 10 and the depth when the gradient was 1 5 was also smaller than that when the gradient was 1 10 therefore the width and depth of the seawater recirculation were both negatively related to the beach gradient and positively related to the tidal amplitude consequently recirculation of seawater cannot occur when the beach gradient is steeper than 1 5 and the tidal amplitude does not exceed 1 0 m fig 10 the depth from the top of the surface water to the elevation of a salt concentration of 0 9 was deeper at high tide than at low tide until the elapsed time reached 22 days 528 days similar to when the amplitude was 1 0 m and the gradient was 1 5 however after about 22 days the depth at high tide was shallower than that at low tide fig 9a similarly the depth from the top of the surface water to the elevation of a salt concentration of 0 1 was deeper at high tide than at low tide until the elapsed time reached 23 days 552 days but after that time the depth at both high tide and low tide ranged from 0 0 to 0 01 m fig 9b when the tide was low the depth from the top of the surface water to the elevation of a salt concentration of 0 9 increased gently from 0 25 m to 0 30 m until 16 days and thereafter became constant at about 0 3 m however when the tide was high the depth from the top of the surface water to the elevation of a salt concentration of 0 9 decreased with elapsed time from about 0 9 m to 0 07 m at an elapsed time of 30 days in contrast the depth from the top of the surface water to the elevation of a salt concentration of 0 1 was always close to zero at low tide at high tide it decreased from about 0 15 m to 0 02 m at an elapsed time of 19 days and thereafter was near zero therefore when the beach gradient was 1 5 there was little freshwater salt concentration 0 1 after 18 days elapsed time at both low and high tide whereas the brackish water layer salt concentration 0 1 to 0 9 overlying the seawater was 0 07 m thick at high tide and 0 30 m thick at low tide at an elapsed time of 30 days fig 9 when the beach gradient was 1 5 and the tidal amplitude was 2 0 m the aspect ratio that is the ratio of the width to the depth of the seawater recirculation in the porous medium increased drastically from 0 to 1 95 from 0 7 day to 1 day elapsed time thereafter the aspect ratio decreased gradually to 0 74 18 by 30 days elapsed time fig 11 similarly when the gradient was 1 10 and the amplitude was 2 0 m the aspect ratio increased from 0 7 day to 1 day and then gently decreased but at 30 days elapsed time it was still 1 0 however when the beach gradient was 1 10 the aspect ratio was 3 3 near the beginning of the seawater recirculation when the amplitude was 0 5 m whereas when the tidal amplitude was 1 0 m the aspect ratio increased until the elapsed time reached 24 days and then decreased gently recall that at this gradient seawater recirculation appeared 9 days later at tidal amplitudes of 0 5 m and 1 0 m than at a tidal amplitude of 2 0 m at tidal amplitudes of both 0 5 m and 1 0 m the aspect ratio was about 1 77 at an elapsed time of 30 days 0 69 greater than that when the amplitude was 2 0 m fig 11 thus the aspect ratio of the seawater recirculation depended on the tidal amplitude when the tidal amplitude was 1 0 and also depended on the beach gradient except when the tidal amplitude was 1 0 m the aspect ratio tended to be lower when the beach gradient was lower and the tidal amplitude was higher when the beach gradient was 1 10 and the tide was high the water level at x 181 m at the foot of the slope was mostly less than or approximately equal to that at x 201 m but occasionally the water level at x 181 m exceeded that at x 201 m fig 12 the maximum difference in water level between x 181 m and x 201 m at high tide was 0 043 m when the water level at x 181 m was higher than that at x 201 m and it was 0 120 m when the water level at x 201 m was higher than that at x 181 m the water level at x 181 m was often below the water level at x 201 m and the difference between the water levels at x 181 m and x 201 m at high tide became greater with elapsed time fig 12a in contrast at low tide the water level at x 181 m never exceeded that at x 201 m rather the water level at x 181 m was approximately equal to or often lower than that at x 201 m as at high tide the difference between the water level at x 181 m and that at x 201 m became gradually smaller with elapsed time at low tide however the maximum difference in the water level between x 181 m and x 201 m at low tide was 0 044 m smaller than the maximum difference of 0 120 m at high tide at low tide the water level at x 181 m dropped less from that at x 201 m than it did at high tide on the whole the water level drop at x 181 m when the tidal amplitude was 0 5 m was similar to that when the amplitude was 1 and 2 m before the elapsed time of 15 days at high tide and at about 18 days elapsed time at low tide subsequently however the drop at x 181 m when the amplitude was 0 5 m became smaller than that when the amplitude was 1 and 2 m the drop at x 181 m when the tidal amplitude was 1 0 m was similar to that when the amplitude was 2 0 m fig 12 thus when the beach gradient was 1 10 the surface water seawater level was not consistent with the tidal water level imposed at the right boundary x 201 m and varied slightly under the influence of water flow in the surface water and gas flow in the atmosphere the surface water level often dropped and the magnitude of the water level drop at high tide was three times that at low tide similarly when the beach gradient was 1 5 the water level at x 181 m rarely exceeded that at x 201 m at high tide and at low tide it exceeded that at x 201 m except the elapsed time of 25 days furthermore at both low and high tide the water level at x 181 m often dropped from the water level at x 201 m the maximum water level drop at x 181 m i e the water level at x 181 m minus that at x 201 m was 0 122 m at high tide and 0 056 m at low tide these maximum drops were similar to those when the beach gradient was 1 10 the water level drop at high tide occasionally exceeded 0 05 cm when the amplitude was 1 0 m but when the amplitude was 2 0 m it was never 0 05 m at low tide the water level drop at x 181 m did not seem to depend on tidal amplitude the water level often dropped whether the beach gradient was 1 5 or 1 10 and the water level at x 181 m was in most cases approximately equal to that at x 201 m the water level when the beach gradient was 1 5 also varied slightly and was not consistent with the tidal water level which was the water level at x 201 m fig 13 when the beach gradient was 1 10 and the tidal amplitude was 2 0 m the surface water seawater level at high tide was about 1 0 m higher than the water level in the porous medium consequently at high tide both the surface water flow and the water flow in the porous medium were mainly in the landward direction and the maximum flow velocity was 4 10 4 m s in the porous medium and 0 5 m s in the surface seawater on the seaward side of the shoreline the water flow was landward in the porous medium and just below the top of the surface water some water flows were upward or downward in the surface seawater because these water flows below the water surface raised or lowered the surface water level the surface water level varied slightly from the tidal water level imposed at the right boundary x 201 m when the tide was high fig 14a in contrast at low tide water saturation was slightly decreased in the porous medium and the water flow in the porous medium directly under the shoreline was radial with a maximum velocity of 1 10 4 m s the water flows in the porous medium were mainly seaward under the offshore slope and landward under the onshore slope because of the seawater recirculation the water flowing in the porous medium landward of the shoreline and the seawater flowing on the landward beach surface did not discharge into the surface water but infiltrated into the porous medium furthermore the surface water flowed uniformly seaward at low tide as a result at low tide when the beach gradient was 1 10 the surface water level did not vary significantly from the water level at x 201 m fig 14b even when the beach gradient was 1 10 and the tidal amplitude was 0 5 m fig 15 there was seawater on the surface of the beach landward of the shoreline that infiltrated into the porous medium at low tide this seawater flowed radially with a maximum velocity 2 10 5 m s into the porous medium whereas water in the porous medium under the seaward slope of the beach flowed seaward fig 15b at high tide the seawater on the beach surface landward of the shoreline infiltrated radially into the porous medium with a maximum velocity of 2 10 5 m s and subsequently flowed offshore as it did at low tide however different from when the tidal amplitude was 2 m the surface water level at high tide was significantly lower than the level at which the water saturation in the porous medium was 1 0 unlike when the amplitude was 2 0 m the direction of the water flow mostly did not vary but approximately paralleled the surface water level consequently the surface water level varied much less when the tidal amplitude was 0 5 m than it did when the amplitude was 2 0 m fig 15a at both low and high tide when the beach gradient was 1 10 and the tidal amplitude was 0 5 m water infiltrated into the porous medium as described above and was discharged into the surface water around the shoreline fig 15 in contrast at high tide when the amplitude was 2 0 m the water overlying the porous medium seaward of the shoreline flowed into the porous medium as described above because the surface water level was higher than the level where the water saturation in the porous medium was 1 0 fig 14 at all tidal amplitudes the edge of the saltwater in the porous medium at low tide was located directly under the shoreline figs 5 8 14 and 15 when the beach gradient was 1 10 the region at the top of the porous medium with s w 1 0 extended slightly farther seaward at low tide than it did at high tide at all tidal amplitudes however when the beach gradient was 1 5 the region at the top of the porous medium with s w 1 0 extended considerably farther seaward at low tide than at high tide at this tidal amplitude the water flow in the porous medium directly under the shoreline was seaward with velocity of 8 10 5 m s thus the seawater did not remain in the porous medium directly under the shoreline consequently no recirculation of seawater occurred in the porous medium when the beach gradient was 1 5 and the tidal amplitude was 1 0 m figs 14 15 and 16 the velocity vectors of water flow on and directly under the surface of the porous medium was often in the direction of the seawater especially at low tide the water pressure in the surface system varied slightly because of gas flow in the atmosphere as a result water saturation at the surface of the porous medium varied the variation in water velocity at the surface of the porous medium might be caused by this variation of water saturation although gas flow in the atmosphere should affect the water flow in the porous medium it would influence only the shallow water flow close to the surface of the porous medium thus the gas pressure and gas flow cannot significantly influence the saltwater wedge and the recirculation of seawater deeper than the seawater level 5 conclusion i previously developed a numerical simulation method called the asgmf method for reproducing gas flow and gas pressure in the atmosphere and a porous medium and water flow and water pressure in surface water and a porous medium asgmf also couples the water pressure and water flow in a porous medium with those in the surface water and can simulate variable density flow and the salt concentration distribution in the porous medium and the surface water in this study the results of numerical simulations with asgmf showed that the recirculation of seawater depends on the tidal amplitude and is greater when the amplitude exceeds 1 0 m but also that it is unlikely to occur when the beach gradient is steep in these simulations the aspect ratio width depth of the seawater recirculation initially increased drastically to 1 0 but thereafter decreased to 1 0 when the tidal amplitude exceeded 1 0 m and to 2 0 when the tidal amplitude was 1 0 m thus when the tidal amplitude was 1 0 m the aspect ratio of the seawater recirculation depended on the tidal amplitude decreasing as the tidal amplitude increased furthermore although the surface water level was equal to the tidal water level in many cases it was sometimes lower than the tidal water level when the tidal amplitude was 1 0 m this drop in the surface water level was significant because water flowed upward or downward in the surface water below the water surface level thus when the beach gradient was both 1 10 and 1 5 the surface water level was not consistent with the tidal water level imposed at the right boundary but varied slightly because of the influence of water flow in the surface water and gas flow in the atmosphere the thickness of the layer of mixed freshwater and seawater in the surface water decreased with tidal amplitude the freshwater layer was thin reaching a maximum of 1 4 the thickness of the brackish mixed layer in addition the thicknesses of both the freshwater layer and the brackish layer were greater at high tide than at low tide consequently when the beach gradient was 1 10 a thin freshwater layer and a mixed freshwater and saltwater layer formed in the surface seawater when seawater recirculation was occurring in the porous medium landward of the shoreline the thicknesses of these layers depended on the tidal water level when the beach gradient was 1 5 after an elapsed time of 18 days there was little freshwater at both low and high tide and at an elapsed time of 30 days only a brackish mixed layer 0 07 m thick at high tide and 0 30 m thick at low tide was present above the seawater therefore the salt concentration in the surface water often differed from the seawater salt concentration because a thin freshwater layer and brackish layer of mixed freshwater and saltwater occurred above the seawater in actual surface seawater near a coast the water flow is not caused only by tidal forcing but can also be influenced by wave action as shown in figs 15 and 16 seawater circulated in the surface seawater and flowed parallel to the top of the surface seawater level because the density of freshwater is less than that of seawater the freshwater discharged to outside the porous medium was transferred by this circulation and flow and it occurred above the seawater and beneath the surface of the surface seawater however when the beach gradient was 1 10 and the tidal amplitude was 2 0 m water flow in the surface seawater was not parallel to the surface and the flow direction went up or down because the difference in water level between low tide and high tide was greater than at other title amplitude as shown in fig 14a further in this case the surface seawater level would not remain constant rather small waves formed in the surface seawater as a result the layer with a salt concentration of 0 0 to 0 1 would become thinner with elapsed time and finally disappear from the surface seawater figs 9 and 14a thus as a result of wave action there might be only a thin mixed zone with a salt concentration between 0 1 and 1 0 all numerical simulations conducted in this study were ended at an elapsed time of 30 days however ideally the numerical simulations would be continued until gas and water flows reached a steady state in the porous medium the surface water and the atmosphere in the future the asgmf numerical simulation method will be improved by further parallelization with mpi to allow simulations of seawater recirculation to be conducted up to an elapsed time of 360 days author statement

1253,biosolids are an important resource for agricultural practice but have recently received increased focus as a potential source of per and polyfluoroalkyl substances pfas in the environment few studies have investigated the transport of pfas through the unsaturated zone under conditions relevant to biosolids application sites herein the unsaturated flow and transport model hydrus is used to evaluate the leaching of per and polyfluoroalkyl substances pfas from land applied biosolids used in agricultural practice to determine the impacts of pfas leaching on underlying groundwater resources this numerical case study was based on conditions and operations at two test sites in central illinois where biosolids were applied at agronomic rates and where pfas contents and desorption characteristics were previously characterized each site possessed different vadose zone soil textural heterogeneity simulations were performed under actual present day meteorological conditions and extended 150 years beyond the initial biosolids application these long term simulations demonstrate how soil equilibrium sorption desorption processes within the biosolids amended surface soils effectively control the transport rate of individual pfas to groundwater air water interfacial awi adsorption which is sometimes considered to be a significant source of pfas retention in vadose zone soils was observed to have minimal impacts on pfas leaching rates within the biosolids amended surface soils at these sites additionally the impact of awi adsorption was found to be most significant for pfas transport within the underlying vadose zone soils when these soils were more texturally homogeneous and considerably less significant within the texturally heterogeneous soils represented herein the results of multiple long term simulations were used to develop an empirical equation that relates predicted maximum pfas pore water concentrations reaching the saturated zone with changes in pfas concentrations in the biosolids amended soil for various biosolids re application events this approach is shown to be very useful in developing site specific pfas soil screening levels and or maximum leachate levels for pfas in support of establishing best management practices bmps for land application of biosolids keywords land applied biosolids pfas leaching pfas vadose zone transport

important supplemental source of nutrients for agronomic silviculture and land restoration purposes biosolids are used in agriculture because they contain high concentrations of essential nutrients primarily nitrogen and phosphorus which are recycled into crop production to supplement or replace inorganic fertilizers biosolids also replenish soil organic matter enhance soil water retention and improve soil properties to support plant root growth the total mass of biosolids applied to soils in the united states u s is substantial approximately 7 2 million dry metric tons of biosolids are generated in the u s annually with roughly 55 or 3 9 million tons being land applied water environment federation wef 2017 while the agricultural application of biosolids represents a beneficial use of an otherwise discarded waste product biosolids have also been shown to be a source of heavy metals pharmaceuticals and other environmental pollutants e g usepa 1990 kinney et al 2006 harrison et al

the soil and potentially impact underlying groundwater resources sepulvado et al 2011 these findings have raised recent concerns about environmental and human health impacts associated with pfas in land applied biosolids such concerns have led to regulations of pfas levels in biosolids in states such as maine and massachusetts which require quarterly monitoring of pfas in biosolids destined for land applications burns 2019 massachusetts department of environmental protection massdep 2022 many pfas are surface active agents or surfactants with the potential to accumulate at environmental interfaces in the vadose zone environment when released into the vadose zone soils primary interfaces include air water interfaces awi within the water unsaturated soil matrix and soil water interfaces where pfas can additionally associate with the solid phase i e sorption both awi adsorption and solid phase sorption combine to slow the rate of pfas transport the significance of pfas adsorption to awis is dependent on the magnitude of the awi area a aw within the vadose zone the surface activity of the pfas and the concentration of pfas in the solution phase the magnitude of a aw within the vadose zone changes temporally and spatially within the vadose zone environment due to changes in soil moisture content θ w as infiltrating rainwater moves vertically downward through the vadose zone the surface activity of a specific pfas molecule varies in response to its structural characteristics such as the pfas alkyl chain length i e carbon number c n and functional group further the amount of adsorbed pfas depends on both concentration and solution ionic strength silva et al 2019 pfas sorption to model sands and natural soils has shown to be generally non ideal e g moderately non linear and kinetically or diffusion controlled guelfo et al 2020 brusseau 2020 these and other complexities associated with pfas vadose zone transport highlight challenges in predicting the environmental impacts due to the occurrence of pfas in land applied biosolids standards of practice for land application of biosolids are based on the united states environmental protection agency usepa part 503 rule i e 40 cfr part 503 usepa 1993 which provides guidance for the agronomic use of biosolids based primarily on nutrient loading limits and mitigating the leaching of toxic metals currently part 503 does not consider other pollutants like pfas further the current understanding of pfas leaching from land applied biosolids including the potential to impact underlying groundwater resources is limited to field studies in which surficial and depth discrete soil samples have been collected and analyzed for pfas over time e g washington et al 2010 sepulvado et al 2011 pepper et al 2021 while these studies provide important information about the impacts of past biosolids application the data collected typically represent snapshots of the vertical distribution of pfas i e type and mass distribution resulting from pfas leaching and do not provide much information needed to evaluate historical and future changes in the vertical distribution of pfas prior field studies also have not provided data needed to evaluate important causal factors or environmental impacts such as the effects of pfas mass application rates associated with biosolids application rates the rate of pfas transport within the vadose zone or the resulting impact on groundwater resources to perform these evaluations numerical methods present a useful tool that can account for the dynamic temporal interchange of pfas mass within the vadose zone in response to transient unsaturated flow conditions resulting from patterns of natural infiltrating precipitation the goal of this work was to evaluate the significance of land applied biosolids as a long term source of pfas in agricultural applications under natural flow conditions and to assess the potential for pfas leaching from these surficial sources to underlying groundwater data collected from two field sites located in central illinois was used to parameterize a version of the well known hydrus unsaturated flow and transport model šimůnek et al 2016 that was recently modified to simulate the transport of pfas in the vadose zone silva et al 2020 here simulated operational variables include vadose zone hydrostratigraphy biosolids loading rate blr and a number of repeated annual biosolids applications at a given blr transport specific variables and conditions were additionally included as will be demonstrated the numerical model was used to evaluate pfas leaching from a source zone and vertical transport in the underlying vadose zone over extended periods which in turn allowed for observation of the true timescales for pfas transport from the surficial source to the underlying groundwater table 2 summary of site characteristics and model preparation a detailed description of the methods and data used to prepare and parameterize hydrus for unsaturated water flow and pfas transport is provided in the supplemental information si the si also includes a detailed discussion of the hydrogeologic characteristics of the test sites used in this evaluation and biosolids application information pertinent to this work the si also provides details pertaining to the numerical modeling approach briefly the two test sites selected for this evaluation are located within agricultural districts in central illinois and were a part of a previous study evaluating the impacts of biosolids application on soil fertility and corn yields metropolitan water reclamation district of greater chicago mwrdgc 2008 higgins et al 2011 at these sites designated sites k and w class b biosolids were applied to individual test plots and were incorporated into the topsoil via tilling biosolids loading rates blr varied between individual plots and were applied over three consecutive years section s1 1 4 1 notably the objective of this current work was not to mirror test plot operations for the purpose of making site specific predictions of groundwater impacts resulting from test operations at this site rather this study used available data from these sites to parameterize hydrus for general use in evaluating the potential impacts of pfas leaching to groundwater when biosolids are applied in some cases simulations used blrs in excess of those actually applied at the test sites however simulations were performed to be consistent with actual dates of initial biosolids application and re application at these sites specific site data used included historical precipitation and evaporation data section s1 1 1 fig s1 site soil types and hydrostratigraphic data section s1 1 3 individual one dimensional 1d simulation profiles were constructed for both test sites i e using hydrus that extended from the ground surface to the water table i e 3 m below ground surface bgs at both sites and incorporated soil textural changes observed at both sites surficial topsoil and vadose zone soils beneath site k were homogeneous deposits of silty fine sand of glacial origin fig s2 the surficial soil at site w was a loam and the underlying soils consisted of layers of silty clay sandy loam and medium grained sands fig s2 textural characteristics and unsaturated hydraulic parameters for the soils are provided in table s1 and fig s3 much of the biosolids specific pfas data used here was derived from the work of sepulvado et al 2011 who examined the leaching of pfas from soils collected from these same test sites this includes a linear biosolids loading rate blr mg ha model used to parameterize pfas mass input in the simulator i e 1 s bs pfas m blr where s bs pfas is the biosolids amended soil concentration ng g soil and m is the slope of the blr s bs pfas regression originally provided by sepulvado et al 2011 table s2 specific pfas of interest in this work included five homologous perfluoroalkyl carboxylates i e perfluorohexanoic acid pfhxa perfluoroheptanoic acid pfhpa perfluorooctanoic acid pfoa perfluorononanoic acid pfna perfluorodecanoic acid pfda and two perfluoroalkyl sulfonates i e perfluorohexane sulfonate pfhxs and perfluorooctane sulfonate pfos the perfluorinated tails of these surfactants consist of linear carbon chains and can be described by their carbon number c n e g c n for pfhxa pfhxs 6 and for pfoa pfos 8 pfas leaching from the biosolids was modeled as a two site kinetic process that assumed sorption and desorption of pfas from soil occurs as both an instantaneous process i e type 1 sites and as a slower rate limited process i e type 2 sites where the fractions of type i f 1 and type 2 f 2 are used in the model i e f 1 f 2 1 section s1 1 4 3 desorption rate coefficients k used to govern the rate limited release of pfas from agricultural soils were derived from another field study washington et al 2010 section s1 1 4 2 table s3 representative soil sorption parameters for the vadose zone soils underlying the biosolids amended topsoil were derived from published laboratory experiments performed by guelfo and higgins 2013 and guelfo et al 2020 specifically pfas sorption to these vadose zone soils was represented using either a linear sorption model or a non linear freundlich model depending on the results of the transport experiments section s1 1 4 3 table s4 sorption and desorption within vadose zone soils were additionally modeled as a rate limited process using the same two site model used for the biosolids amended topsoil representative f values and k values for these soils table s5 were derived from the work of guelfo et al 2020 awi adsorption was modeled as a langmuir type adsorption process and the dependence of awi area on changes in soil moisture content θ w was modeled using the leverett thermodynamic model also described in the si section 1 1 4 4 and in the recent literature silva et al 2020 2022 the relationship between a aw and θ w used for the site soils is shown in fig s3 awi adsorption parameters used in these simulations are provided in table s6 finally simulations used two monitoring points at both sites the first was positioned at the base of the tilled topsoil containing biosolids i e 30 cm bgs which also represents the base of the pfas source zone to monitor the dynamics of pfas leaching from the source zone the second monitoring point was positioned at the top of the capillary fringe representing the first point of contact with the saturated zone this point provides information about the potential impacts of pfas leaching from biosolids sources on groundwater pore water in the capillary fringe is tension saturated i e hydraulic head is less than atmospheric pressure or h 0 where reference pressure is defined as 0 at atmospheric pressure however because it is fully saturated significant horizontal flow first occurs here which exchanges with flowing groundwater at and below the water table defined as h 0 silliman et al 2002 3 results and discussion 3 1 source zone dynamics generally the magnitude and rate of loss of pfas mass from the source ultimately govern the degree and longevity of the impact on underlying groundwater resources therefore our first objective was to focus this evaluation on pfas leaching from the biosolids applied to the surface soils simulations were performed for a single biosolids application event occurring in the fall of 2004 for site w and the spring of 2005 for site k this timing of the simulated application events is in keeping with the actual initial biosolids application for these sites the simulated leaching of pfas from the applied biosolids is characteristic of a temporally diminishing source fig 1 with the rate of change in pfas concentrations in the leachate c w consistent with the comparative magnitude of the desorption coefficient k des assigned to individual pfas table s3 that is pfas with lower c n each from the biosolids source faster than those with higher c n this is consistent with field data where existing sources show more rapid depletion of lower c n i e lower molecular weight pfas sepulvado et al 2011 bekele et al 2020 the variability in c w superimposed on pfas leaching trends observed for some pfas demonstrates the response of the solution phase concentration to awi adsorption as infiltrating precipitation changed the θ w and magnitude of the a aw throughout the simulation period note that increasing θ w corresponds with decreaseing a aw and vice versa this variability is most pronounced for pfna and pfda and less pronounced for the remaining pfas this reflects the variability in the significance of awi adsorption vs interaction with the soil for a given pfas relative to their interaction with the soil the lower c n pfas e g pfhxa pfhpa and pfhxs are less surface active and therefore awi adsorption is less significant pfna and pfda are among the most surface active solutes considered here note the magnitudes of the awi adsorption coefficients provided in table s6 therefore in these cases awi adsorption competes more effectively with soil sorption processes to raise and lower c w when θ w and a aw change within the pfas source in contrast while pfda and pfos share similar surface activity the temporal trend in c w for pfos does not exhibit the same degree of variability observed for pfda pfos in this case is more strongly associated with the soil phase i e highest k des table s3 which out competes awi adsorption in the distribution of pfas mass generally rates of pfas desorption from the source zones for the lower c n pfas were observed to increase with decreasing blr over the 15 year simulation period figs s4 and s5 however for the higher c n pfass the rate of decrease in concentration was much less dependent on the blr figs s4 and s5 these results are attributed to differences in the affinity of the different pfas for the biosolids amended soil as sorption desorption processes within the source soils retard the transport of the lower c n pfass than the higher c n pfass additionally for a given blr the rate of pfas leaching was found to be largely insensitive to the rate constant used figs s4 and s5 even when its value is varied by two orders of magnitude table s6 this lack of sensitivity is attributed to 1 the generally high k des of the biosolids amended soils 2 the relatively small fraction of rate limited sites associated with these same soils f 2 0 16 in this case and 3 the low concentration gradients associated with low pfas leachate concentrations which limit the driving force for mass transfer to the rate limited sites the limited influence of sorption desorption kinetics on the leaching of pfas from shallow source zones for observed for the 15 year simulations performed here is consistent with a prior long term leaching evaluation kuntz and grathwohl 2009 these results demonstrate that equilibrium sorption would be an appropriate transport model simplification for sites k and w this result is significant because it suggests that when biosolids are applied to surface soils at typical agronomic loading rates predicted rates of pfas mass loss from the surficial soil source are more dependent on an accurate characterization of the equilibrium sorption desorption parameters than on non equilibrium parameters 3 2 vadose zone hydrodynamics vadose zone hydrodynamics are indicative of the interplay between changes in soil moisture and other soil hydraulic and physical properties infiltrating precipitation increases θ w resulting in a corresponding increase in unsaturated hydraulic conductivity k unsat the downward flux of water q the volume of water per unit area per time and contaminant mass changes in θ w vary spatially and temporally within the vadose zone resulting in the transient character of the hydraulic properties profiles fig 2 similarly changes in θ w result in concomitant changes in a aw e g silva et al 2022 which governs the amount of pfas mass adsorbed at awis and thereby regulates the mass flux of contaminants within the vadose zone for site k the pfas source zone and the underlying vadose zone share the same hydraulic properties but different transport characteristics i e soil sorption desorption coefficients and rate constants hydraulically site k is modeled as a homogeneous system and the response observed in the parameters in fig 2 reflects this homogeneity k unsat values are periodically very low near the soil surface due to low θ w due to evaporation however k unsat generally ranges between 0 01 and 1 cm day below the surface this is well below the saturated conductivity 21 2 cm day of this silty sandy soil and q is thus more variable in this system and more dependent on precipitation variability this well drained soil provides a lower pseudo steady state moisture content that yields elevated a aw values ranging between 200 and 400 cm2 cm3 and promotes more significant retention via awi adsorption in the upper vadose zone relative to site w see below the vadose zone at site w is texturally and hydraulically heterogeneous the loamy pfas source zone retains more soil moisture during the simulation period which is shown in the uppermost layer of fig 2g generally θ w is shown to increase in time within individual strata resulting in independent inter layer changes in a aw values the general increase in retained moisture increases k unsat values within the system resulting in a reasonably uniform k unsat distribution vertically due to the higher overall θ w k unsat in site w soils can more readily approach the saturated hydraulic conductivity the pseudo steady state flux of water in the site w vadose zone is also generally vertically uniform although the water flux is still lower in the site w vadose zone than in the site k vadose zone however incidents of greater than average rainfall can significantly increase q in this system i e note the significant increase in q at year 15 fig 2f given the hydraulic and sorption heterogeneity pfas would be expected to transport more slowly in the vadose zone at site w vs site k and the transport rate will be less sharply affected by precipitation patterns leaching of pfas from the source zone would also be expected to be slowed due to the hydraulic limitations of the underlying strata 3 3 significance of pfas awi adsorption awi adsorption can play a significant role in regulating the rate of pfas transport in the vadose zone however this was not the case within the biosolids amended source zones of sites k and w regardless of whether awi adsorption was or was not considered in these simulations the overall rate of pfas leaching from the biosolids amended soil source zone into the vadose zone does not change at either site fig 3 these results again demonstrate the dominance of soil sorption desorption processes on pfas leaching from the surficial source soils in these simulated cases note again the fluctuating c w values in simulations that considered awi adsorption compared to smooth changes in c w values when awi adsorption was neglected this is because awi adsorption depends on changes in θ w and awi area while soil sorption does not infiltrating water increases θ w and reduces awi area producing the release of pfas from awi to the soil solution on the other hand evaporation decreases θ w and increases awi area producing the mass transfer of pfas from the soil solution to awi the effect of awi adsorption on the simulated transport of pfas within the entire vadose zone is shown in figs 4 and 5 for sites k and w respectively for the less surface active pfas awi adsorption does not significantly contribute to transport at either site however as the surface activity of the solute increases awi adsorption plays a more significant role in the retention of these solutes for example at the more homogeneous site k transport of pfoa is observed to be moderately accelerated and the transport of pfos is significantly accelerated when awi adsorption is not considered in the model the effect is not nearly as contributive at the texturally heterogeneous site w while clear differences exist in the rate of change of pfas concentrations in the upper part of the vadose zone after 15 years pfoa concentrations contacting the saturated zone are not significantly different whether awi adsorption is considered or not likewise after 15 simulated years pfos at site w has not contacted the saturated zone and has transported to essentially the same depth i e 265 cm regardless of whether awi adsorption is considered assuming equivalent meteorological inputs the significance of awi adsorption on the overall transport of surface active solutes is dependent on three primary factors 1 the degree of affinity for the solid phase as demonstrated for the biosolids amended soils 2 the surface activity of the solute i e an affinity for the awi and 3 the magnitude of a aw as it changes during infiltration events i e higher a aw values associated with lower water content values provide increased awi adsorption and retention of surface active solutes factor 3 is strongly influenced by textural heterogeneity at site k the modeled soil textural homogeneity of the vadose zone soils allows for the establishment of a smaller pseudo steady state θ w condition that promotes awi adsorption in the upper vadose zone fig 2 by maintaining higher a aw in the absence of awi adsorption transport occurs much faster because transport is now dependent only on the hydraulic properties of the media and interactions with the solid phase at site w the modeled soil textural heterogeneity limits the contribution of awi adsorption because the soils beneath the biosolids amended source zone maintain a higher θ w and as a result lower a aw awi adsorption is therefore not significant in the upper site w vadose zone and does not contribute significantly to the retention of pfas in this system at site w pfas transport is dominated by interactions with the soils and the hydraulics of unsaturated flow these results demonstrate how soil textural heterogeneity can under certain conditions play a more important role than awi adsorption in determining the magnitude and rate of pfas transport in the vadose zone even for more surface active pfas e g pfos in these cases the downward coarsening sequence of soil layering present at site w fig s2 promotes this heterogeneity imposed hydraulic control on pfas transport alternatively if the soils beneath the topsoil were coarser e g sand steady state soil moisture would likely be lower within that underlying coarse layer and a aw values would be much higher see a aw θ w curves fig s3c and awi adsorption would play a greater role in pfas retention however hydraulic conditions within the site w loam topsoil would still limit the rate and magnitude of leaching in this case because of the intermittent release of pfas from that source soil due to the capillary barrier effect i e infiltrating precipitation would need to build up enough hydraulic head at the loam sand interface to overcome the suction in that layer and initiate flow within the underlying sand further the flux of water entering the coarser media would be limited by the overall lower hydraulic conductivity of the surface soil therefore soil textural heterogeneity should be considered carefully when simulating pfas leaching in the vadose zone 3 4 leaching of pfas from a land applied biosolids source 3 4 1 single event biosolids application to better evaluate pfas leaching in these systems pfas transport in the vadose zone was simulated for a single biosolids application over a longer simulated time period an example of the simulated arrival of pfas at the top of the capillary fringe at both test sites is presented in fig 6 for blr 50 mg ha immediately apparent in fig 6 are the differences in the time needed for these pfas to reach the saturated zone the less surface active pfas i e pfhxa pfhpa pfoa pfhxs are generally less retained by soil interactions and awi adsorption in these systems and therefore move more rapidly through the vadose zone however the higher c n pfas i e pfna pfda and pfos in this case are more surface active and sorbing and are considerably more retained requiring many decades to transport to the saturated zone and impact groundwater resources the times required to achieve maximum pfas concentrations are also remarkable with pfos shown to require 60 years to reach a peak concentration at the top of the saturated zone at site k and 109 years at site w cumulative mass flux cmf plots additionally demonstrate the differences in arrival times for pfas represented in this work fig 6 cmf values are presented using hectares as the areal dimension to be consistent with units used for the blrs and are useful as input datasets i e source terms for groundwater i e saturated zone modeling efforts the time to approach maximal cmf reflects the transport characteristics of the individual pfas and the magnitude of the maximum cmf achieved reflects the initial pfas mass loading within the source zone for a given blr for these sites the maximal cumulative pfas mass flux entering the saturated zone was 1 to 100 g per hectare of biosolids amended land but in some cases required several decades to reach that loading expanding this evaluation simulations were performed for additional single event biosolids applications at blrs of 5 10 25 50 and 100 mg ha the results of these simulations for pfoa and pfos are presented in fig 7 simulated maximum or peak leachate concentrations reaching the saturated zone c w max for all pfas evaluated herein table s7 increased linearly with increasing blr for all pfas evaluated consistent with the use of a linear loading rate model used to parameterize pfas mass input in the simulator eq 1 the slope of the blr c w max regression can be used to directly estimate the maximum blr for a given site and pfas however because the pfas mass associated with the applied biosolids can change from source to source and over time it is more practical to represent predicted c w max values as a function of s bs pfas e g pfoa and pfos in fig 8 s bs pfas values were calculated using eq 1 and the values for all pfas included in this evaluation are presented in table s8 the slopes of the linear regressions of this data are likewise provided in table s9 these data can then be used to directly estimate c w max values for these sites and simulated conditions if s bs pfas is determined for a given biosolids application 3 4 2 multiple biosolids applications in practice biosolids are often applied annually over multi year cycles as was the case for test sites k and w higgins et al 2011 therefore additional simulations were performed to examine the effect of multi year biosolids applications on maximum pfas concentrations in leachate reaching the saturated zone lower and more agronomic blr s of 5 10 and 25 mg ha and annual biosolids re application periods t app of 1 3 5 and 10 years were used in these simulations the remaining conditions and parameters were the same as in previous simulations examples of the simulated arrival of pfoa and pfos at different application periods are presented in fig 9 for both test sites additionally simulated c w max values for pfoa and pfos resulting from the various application periods and loading rates are provided in fig 10 as shown in fig 10 simulated c w max was observed to increase nonlinearly with t app and a 2nd order polynomial regression equation forced through the origin was used to represent the trend in the data for the t app c w max relationships the degree of non linearity increased with increasing blr which is most clearly observed in pfoa results e g fig 10a and c but is also evident in fig 9 where the leading edge of the pfoa arrival profiles are coincident which indicates the initial pfas arrival times are independent of t app for a given blr similar to increasing the blr multiple annual biosolids applications increase the pfas c w max reaching the groundwater table however multiple annual applications ultimately provide a greater c w max values for a given blr due to the re application of a fresh source of pfas that increases the pfas mass within the surface soils i e s bs pfas and in the leachate these results indicate a practical limit for biosolids applications in agriculture would need to be derived to be protective of underlying groundwater resources like regression equations presented in figs 7 and 8 those provided in fig 10 could also be used to estimate c w max for pfas at different values of t app and for the blr and associated s bs pfas values applied however a unifying predictive relationship is preferred to include the impacts of both s bs pfas and t app for an individual site to this end the slope values of the linear sbs pfas cw max regressions table s9 were regressed against t app and fit using a 2nd order polynomial regression equation forced through the origin these m t app relationships were then used in combination with sbs pfas cw max regression equations to derive the following polynomial expression that allows the prediction of c w max for various combinations of s bs pfas and t app as 2 c w max s bs pfas a 1 t app 2 a 2 t app where a 1 and a 2 are regression coefficients for the pfas of interest table 1 this approach was used for both sites as proposed eq 2 is site specific and additionally dependent on the linearity of s bs pfas with changes in blr for the biosolids applied therefore additional model simulations would need to be performed for a given site to derive new site specific a 1 and a 2 parameters however once derived eq 2 could be applied to the development of site specific pfas soil screening levels and or maximum leachate levels for pfas for proposed s bs pfas and t app to develop best management practices bmps for land application of biosolids 3 5 implications for groundwater contamination the usepa recommended the use of 70 ng l for pfoa and pfos i e individual or combined as the preliminary remediation goal prg for groundwater contaminated by pfas which is a current or potential source of drinking water for sites where state or local metrics have not been adopted usepa 2019 if this same metric is used to define maximum allowable leaching levels for pfoa and pfos the allowable leaching level is shown to have been exceeded at site k and site w for a single blr of 50 mg ha fig 8 likewise this prg is met or exceeded for several multi year applications shown in figs 9 and 10 however more typically the prg of 70 ng l would be for pfoa and pfos arriving or produced at a down gradient receptor point e g a surface water body or groundwater well therefore depending on the distance between the receptor and the biosolids application area attenuation processes may allow pfas leachate concentrations immediately beneath the biosolids application site to be in excess of 70 ng l well known analytical solutions for solute transport e g domenico 1987 have been incorporated into various analytical models to allow the estimation of dilution attenuation factors daf at user defined distances from the source of contamination e g nevin et al 1997 usepa 2000 using the domenico model for a sorbing and non decaying solute section s3 and relevant site specific inputs for these sites daf values were calculated for pfoa and pfos at site k table 2 the daf value was used to determine c w max for a 70 ng l arrival at a given receptor distance from the source in turn these c w max values were used to determine the corresponding s bs pfas values for pfoa and pfos using the linear regression and slope values described above table s9 these s bs pfas values would then be the maximum values or potential site specific soil screening levels ssl for pfoa and pfos that represent the maximum pfas mass per unit mass of soil that could be applied to the land surface either in a single event or accumulated or over multiple application events to avoid exceeding the 70 ng l prg at a distant receptor for example a receptor positioned 500 ft ft downgradient of site k would see pfoa and pfos concentrations exceed the 70 ng l limit when s bs pfoa and s bs pfos at site k exceed 4 32 and 48 9 μg kg respectively or when the cumulative blr in each case exceeds 288 and 247 mg ha respectively given the significant amount of time needed for pfoa and pfos transport in the vadose zone and the arrival of the peak concentration at the saturated zone the potential for prg exceedances at potential receptors should additionally be considered in both the nearer term i e based on pfoa peak arrival times and in the much longer term i e based on peak pfos peak arrival as maximum solution concentrations at the receptors could occur many decades after initial biosolids application regarding the continued and long term use of biosolids at these sites the simulated results of this work suggest biosolids application should be a strictly managed activity in a manner consistent with the management methods outlined in usepa 40 cfr part 503 for metals the blr values greater than those in table 2 would result in exceedances of the 70 ng l leachate level for pfas at different receptor distances at site k however given the longevity of biosolids as a source of pfas and the significant times involved in pfas contamination of groundwater for these sites the same blr s bs pfas values may also be the practical upper lifetime limit of biosolids application for these sites concentrations of pfas of current regulatory concern e g pfoa and pfos in municipal biosolids will vary between source municipalities and could ultimately diminish over time as these compounds are phased out of consumer products additionally methods to treat the biosolids to reduce pfas concentrations prior to land application should be evaluated any reduction of the pfas mass loading will extend the beneficial and safe use of these products for agricultural applications the usepa recently updated its lifetime drinking water health advisory limit for pfoa and pfos to 0 004 ng l and 0 02 ng l respectively usepa 2022 however at the time of this publication it is unclear whether the prg has also been updated to what degree these recommended advisory levels will be adapted as state level regulatory limits and whether analytical methods will be developed that can routinely and reliably evaluate these levels in drinking water regardless the approach and methods described in this current evaluation could prove useful to agricultural practitioners management as these environmental regulatory metrics change in the future to reflect new toxicity data and regulation of additional pfas 4 conclusions because pfas are present in land applied municipal biosolids it is important to understand the fate and transport of these contaminants in the vadose zone to assess the potential for groundwater contamination in this work numerical simulations were employed to evaluate the significance of land applied biosolids as a long term source of pfas in agricultural applications under natural infiltration conditions using flow and pfas specific transport parameters derived from existing site information or the literature simulations were performed for two test sites located in the same climatic zone with differing vadose zone hydrostratigraphy results of these simulations demonstrated the following within the biosolids amended pfas source soil sorption desorption processes were the dominant retention mechanisms for pfas with rate limited desorption contributing minimally to the overall release rate of pfas from the source this result is significant because it suggests that over the long term rates of pfas mass loss from the surficial biosolids amended soil source are most dependent on the accurate characterization of the equilibrium soil interaction parameters than on those for non equilibrium processes this in turn simplifies leaching calculations while awi adsorption can be an important process for retaining pfas in the vadose zone this process did not contribute significantly to the overall release rate of pfas from the biosolids amended source soils at either test site climate conditions at these sites provided persistently elevated soil moisture conditions and correspondingly lower a aw values within these surface soils that minimized the contribution of awi adsorption within the vadose zone soils underlying biosolids amended source soils awi adsorption was observed to be most contributive to the retention of pfas at site k where the vadose zone was characterized and modeled as a predominantly homogeneous vadose zone of silty sand at site k lower moisture conditions and thus larger a aw values were maintained throughout the 150 year simulation period this condition allowed awi adsorption to play a more significant role in limiting the rate of pfas transport to groundwater particularly for the more surface active pfas in contrast textural heterogeneities and finer grained soils at site w collectively minimized the role of awi adsorption resulting in faster transport to groundwater for the same pfas source condition even with an overall lower unsaturated hydraulic conductivity finer grained soils comprising the upper vadose zone at site w retained more moisture throughout the period of simulation resulting in lower a aw values and less overall retention of pfas these results are consistent with prior work highlighting the impact of vadose zone hydrostratigraphy on the significance of awi adsorption as a mechanism for pfas retention during leaching from a surficial source silva et al 2020 individual pfas leach from a biosolids source transport through the vadose zone at different rates and reach the saturated zone at different times for linear perfluoroalkyl pfas employed herein the rate of transport is dependent on the pfas c n which impacts its surface activity and the interaction with the soil solid phase and its surface activity for two of the pfas of federal regulatory concern used here i e pfoa and pfos peak concentrations arrive at the saturated zone many decades apart fig 7 this requires treating pfoa and pfos separately when applying usepa guidance on pfas limits for groundwater increasing the blr at both sites increased pfas concentrations in the leachate but did not impact the rate of release from the source zone increasing the number of annual biosolids application events also increased pfas concentrations but did not significantly affect the rate of transport of individual pfas through the vadose zone however it did increase the overall mass of pfas leaching through the soil for a given blr peak pfas concentrations reaching the saturated zone increased linearly with increasing blr and increased nonlinearly with increasing biosolids re application at a given blr the results of these simulations were used to develop an empirical equation eq 2 that was in turn used to directly evaluate the impact of biosolids amended soil pfas loading rates and annual re application periods on pfas leaching concentrations for a given test site this approach could be useful in developing site specific soil screening levels for pfas in support of bmps for land application of biosolids containing pfas at additional sites likewise an up scaled version of this approach could be used to develop state or county level soil screening levels for generic soil conditions most common in areas where biosolids land application sites are present example soil screening calculations for site k table 2 also demonstrate that the numerical modeling approach used here can support the continued safe use of biosolids with respect to managing impacts related to pfas and groundwater contamination in a manner consistent with the methods outlined in usepa 40 cfr part 503 for other biosolid specific contaminants in this work it was assumed that a finite mass of pfas was applied as either a single application or as incremental additions associated with an annual biosolids application however recent investigations have shown the potential for degradation of pfas precursor compounds within land applied biosolids that could be represented as an additional source of some pfas over the time scales represented herein roehler et al 2021 for the current case this additional source of pfas could impact the magnitude of c w max values and breakthrough profiles in figs 7 and 10 would plateau at a different c w max for those pfas being produced given that the rates and duration of pfas production can be characterized such a source of pfas could be simulated as an in situ production process within the source zone as was done in our prior work silva et al 2020 however simulated pfas arrival times and the general approach proposed here to estabilish soil screening levels and assist

1253,biosolids are an important resource for agricultural practice but have recently received increased focus as a potential source of per and polyfluoroalkyl substances pfas in the environment few studies have investigated the transport of pfas through the unsaturated zone under conditions relevant to biosolids application sites herein the unsaturated flow and transport model hydrus is used to evaluate the leaching of per and polyfluoroalkyl substances pfas from land applied biosolids used in agricultural practice to determine the impacts of pfas leaching on underlying groundwater resources this numerical case study was based on conditions and operations at two test sites in central illinois where biosolids were applied at agronomic rates and where pfas contents and desorption characteristics were previously characterized each site possessed different vadose zone soil textural heterogeneity simulations were performed under actual present day meteorological conditions and extended 150 years beyond the initial biosolids application these long term simulations demonstrate how soil equilibrium sorption desorption processes within the biosolids amended surface soils effectively control the transport rate of individual pfas to groundwater air water interfacial awi adsorption which is sometimes considered to be a significant source of pfas retention in vadose zone soils was observed to have minimal impacts on pfas leaching rates within the biosolids amended surface soils at these sites additionally the impact of awi adsorption was found to be most significant for pfas transport within the underlying vadose zone soils when these soils were more texturally homogeneous and considerably less significant within the texturally heterogeneous soils represented herein the results of multiple long term simulations were used to develop an empirical equation that relates predicted maximum pfas pore water concentrations reaching the saturated zone with changes in pfas concentrations in the biosolids amended soil for various biosolids re application events this approach is shown to be very useful in developing site specific pfas soil screening levels and or maximum leachate levels for pfas in support of establishing best management practices bmps for land application of biosolids keywords land applied biosolids pfas leaching pfas vadose zone transport

important supplemental source of nutrients for agronomic silviculture and land restoration purposes biosolids are used in agriculture because they contain high concentrations of essential nutrients primarily nitrogen and phosphorus which are recycled into crop production to supplement or replace inorganic fertilizers biosolids also replenish soil organic matter enhance soil water retention and improve soil properties to support plant root growth the total mass of biosolids applied to soils in the united states u s is substantial approximately 7 2 million dry metric tons of biosolids are generated in the u s annually with roughly 55 or 3 9 million tons being land applied water environment federation wef 2017 while the agricultural application of biosolids represents a beneficial use of an otherwise discarded waste product biosolids have also been shown to be a source of heavy metals pharmaceuticals and other environmental pollutants e g usepa 1990 kinney et al 2006 harrison et al

the soil and potentially impact underlying groundwater resources sepulvado et al 2011 these findings have raised recent concerns about environmental and human health impacts associated with pfas in land applied biosolids such concerns have led to regulations of pfas levels in biosolids in states such as maine and massachusetts which require quarterly monitoring of pfas in biosolids destined for land applications burns 2019 massachusetts department of environmental protection massdep 2022 many pfas are surface active agents or surfactants with the potential to accumulate at environmental interfaces in the vadose zone environment when released into the vadose zone soils primary interfaces include air water interfaces awi within the water unsaturated soil matrix and soil water interfaces where pfas can additionally associate with the solid phase i e sorption both awi adsorption and solid phase sorption combine to slow the rate of pfas transport the significance of pfas adsorption to awis is dependent on the magnitude of the awi area a aw within the vadose zone the surface activity of the pfas and the concentration of pfas in the solution phase the magnitude of a aw within the vadose zone changes temporally and spatially within the vadose zone environment due to changes in soil moisture content θ w as infiltrating rainwater moves vertically downward through the vadose zone the surface activity of a specific pfas molecule varies in response to its structural characteristics such as the pfas alkyl chain length i e carbon number c n and functional group further the amount of adsorbed pfas depends on both concentration and solution ionic strength silva et al 2019 pfas sorption to model sands and natural soils has shown to be generally non ideal e g moderately non linear and kinetically or diffusion controlled guelfo et al 2020 brusseau 2020 these and other complexities associated with pfas vadose zone transport highlight challenges in predicting the environmental impacts due to the occurrence of pfas in land applied biosolids standards of practice for land application of biosolids are based on the united states environmental protection agency usepa part 503 rule i e 40 cfr part 503 usepa 1993 which provides guidance for the agronomic use of biosolids based primarily on nutrient loading limits and mitigating the leaching of toxic metals currently part 503 does not consider other pollutants like pfas further the current understanding of pfas leaching from land applied biosolids including the potential to impact underlying groundwater resources is limited to field studies in which surficial and depth discrete soil samples have been collected and analyzed for pfas over time e g washington et al 2010 sepulvado et al 2011 pepper et al 2021 while these studies provide important information about the impacts of past biosolids application the data collected typically represent snapshots of the vertical distribution of pfas i e type and mass distribution resulting from pfas leaching and do not provide much information needed to evaluate historical and future changes in the vertical distribution of pfas prior field studies also have not provided data needed to evaluate important causal factors or environmental impacts such as the effects of pfas mass application rates associated with biosolids application rates the rate of pfas transport within the vadose zone or the resulting impact on groundwater resources to perform these evaluations numerical methods present a useful tool that can account for the dynamic temporal interchange of pfas mass within the vadose zone in response to transient unsaturated flow conditions resulting from patterns of natural infiltrating precipitation the goal of this work was to evaluate the significance of land applied biosolids as a long term source of pfas in agricultural applications under natural flow conditions and to assess the potential for pfas leaching from these surficial sources to underlying groundwater data collected from two field sites located in central illinois was used to parameterize a version of the well known hydrus unsaturated flow and transport model šimůnek et al 2016 that was recently modified to simulate the transport of pfas in the vadose zone silva et al 2020 here simulated operational variables include vadose zone hydrostratigraphy biosolids loading rate blr and a number of repeated annual biosolids applications at a given blr transport specific variables and conditions were additionally included as will be demonstrated the numerical model was used to evaluate pfas leaching from a source zone and vertical transport in the underlying vadose zone over extended periods which in turn allowed for observation of the true timescales for pfas transport from the surficial source to the underlying groundwater table 2 summary of site characteristics and model preparation a detailed description of the methods and data used to prepare and parameterize hydrus for unsaturated water flow and pfas transport is provided in the supplemental information si the si also includes a detailed discussion of the hydrogeologic characteristics of the test sites used in this evaluation and biosolids application information pertinent to this work the si also provides details pertaining to the numerical modeling approach briefly the two test sites selected for this evaluation are located within agricultural districts in central illinois and were a part of a previous study evaluating the impacts of biosolids application on soil fertility and corn yields metropolitan water reclamation district of greater chicago mwrdgc 2008 higgins et al 2011 at these sites designated sites k and w class b biosolids were applied to individual test plots and were incorporated into the topsoil via tilling biosolids loading rates blr varied between individual plots and were applied over three consecutive years section s1 1 4 1 notably the objective of this current work was not to mirror test plot operations for the purpose of making site specific predictions of groundwater impacts resulting from test operations at this site rather this study used available data from these sites to parameterize hydrus for general use in evaluating the potential impacts of pfas leaching to groundwater when biosolids are applied in some cases simulations used blrs in excess of those actually applied at the test sites however simulations were performed to be consistent with actual dates of initial biosolids application and re application at these sites specific site data used included historical precipitation and evaporation data section s1 1 1 fig s1 site soil types and hydrostratigraphic data section s1 1 3 individual one dimensional 1d simulation profiles were constructed for both test sites i e using hydrus that extended from the ground surface to the water table i e 3 m below ground surface bgs at both sites and incorporated soil textural changes observed at both sites surficial topsoil and vadose zone soils beneath site k were homogeneous deposits of silty fine sand of glacial origin fig s2 the surficial soil at site w was a loam and the underlying soils consisted of layers of silty clay sandy loam and medium grained sands fig s2 textural characteristics and unsaturated hydraulic parameters for the soils are provided in table s1 and fig s3 much of the biosolids specific pfas data used here was derived from the work of sepulvado et al 2011 who examined the leaching of pfas from soils collected from these same test sites this includes a linear biosolids loading rate blr mg ha model used to parameterize pfas mass input in the simulator i e 1 s bs pfas m blr where s bs pfas is the biosolids amended soil concentration ng g soil and m is the slope of the blr s bs pfas regression originally provided by sepulvado et al 2011 table s2 specific pfas of interest in this work included five homologous perfluoroalkyl carboxylates i e perfluorohexanoic acid pfhxa perfluoroheptanoic acid pfhpa perfluorooctanoic acid pfoa perfluorononanoic acid pfna perfluorodecanoic acid pfda and two perfluoroalkyl sulfonates i e perfluorohexane sulfonate pfhxs and perfluorooctane sulfonate pfos the perfluorinated tails of these surfactants consist of linear carbon chains and can be described by their carbon number c n e g c n for pfhxa pfhxs 6 and for pfoa pfos 8 pfas leaching from the biosolids was modeled as a two site kinetic process that assumed sorption and desorption of pfas from soil occurs as both an instantaneous process i e type 1 sites and as a slower rate limited process i e type 2 sites where the fractions of type i f 1 and type 2 f 2 are used in the model i e f 1 f 2 1 section s1 1 4 3 desorption rate coefficients k used to govern the rate limited release of pfas from agricultural soils were derived from another field study washington et al 2010 section s1 1 4 2 table s3 representative soil sorption parameters for the vadose zone soils underlying the biosolids amended topsoil were derived from published laboratory experiments performed by guelfo and higgins 2013 and guelfo et al 2020 specifically pfas sorption to these vadose zone soils was represented using either a linear sorption model or a non linear freundlich model depending on the results of the transport experiments section s1 1 4 3 table s4 sorption and desorption within vadose zone soils were additionally modeled as a rate limited process using the same two site model used for the biosolids amended topsoil representative f values and k values for these soils table s5 were derived from the work of guelfo et al 2020 awi adsorption was modeled as a langmuir type adsorption process and the dependence of awi area on changes in soil moisture content θ w was modeled using the leverett thermodynamic model also described in the si section 1 1 4 4 and in the recent literature silva et al 2020 2022 the relationship between a aw and θ w used for the site soils is shown in fig s3 awi adsorption parameters used in these simulations are provided in table s6 finally simulations used two monitoring points at both sites the first was positioned at the base of the tilled topsoil containing biosolids i e 30 cm bgs which also represents the base of the pfas source zone to monitor the dynamics of pfas leaching from the source zone the second monitoring point was positioned at the top of the capillary fringe representing the first point of contact with the saturated zone this point provides information about the potential impacts of pfas leaching from biosolids sources on groundwater pore water in the capillary fringe is tension saturated i e hydraulic head is less than atmospheric pressure or h 0 where reference pressure is defined as 0 at atmospheric pressure however because it is fully saturated significant horizontal flow first occurs here which exchanges with flowing groundwater at and below the water table defined as h 0 silliman et al 2002 3 results and discussion 3 1 source zone dynamics generally the magnitude and rate of loss of pfas mass from the source ultimately govern the degree and longevity of the impact on underlying groundwater resources therefore our first objective was to focus this evaluation on pfas leaching from the biosolids applied to the surface soils simulations were performed for a single biosolids application event occurring in the fall of 2004 for site w and the spring of 2005 for site k this timing of the simulated application events is in keeping with the actual initial biosolids application for these sites the simulated leaching of pfas from the applied biosolids is characteristic of a temporally diminishing source fig 1 with the rate of change in pfas concentrations in the leachate c w consistent with the comparative magnitude of the desorption coefficient k des assigned to individual pfas table s3 that is pfas with lower c n each from the biosolids source faster than those with higher c n this is consistent with field data where existing sources show more rapid depletion of lower c n i e lower molecular weight pfas sepulvado et al 2011 bekele et al 2020 the variability in c w superimposed on pfas leaching trends observed for some pfas demonstrates the response of the solution phase concentration to awi adsorption as infiltrating precipitation changed the θ w and magnitude of the a aw throughout the simulation period note that increasing θ w corresponds with decreaseing a aw and vice versa this variability is most pronounced for pfna and pfda and less pronounced for the remaining pfas this reflects the variability in the significance of awi adsorption vs interaction with the soil for a given pfas relative to their interaction with the soil the lower c n pfas e g pfhxa pfhpa and pfhxs are less surface active and therefore awi adsorption is less significant pfna and pfda are among the most surface active solutes considered here note the magnitudes of the awi adsorption coefficients provided in table s6 therefore in these cases awi adsorption competes more effectively with soil sorption processes to raise and lower c w when θ w and a aw change within the pfas source in contrast while pfda and pfos share similar surface activity the temporal trend in c w for pfos does not exhibit the same degree of variability observed for pfda pfos in this case is more strongly associated with the soil phase i e highest k des table s3 which out competes awi adsorption in the distribution of pfas mass generally rates of pfas desorption from the source zones for the lower c n pfas were observed to increase with decreasing blr over the 15 year simulation period figs s4 and s5 however for the higher c n pfass the rate of decrease in concentration was much less dependent on the blr figs s4 and s5 these results are attributed to differences in the affinity of the different pfas for the biosolids amended soil as sorption desorption processes within the source soils retard the transport of the lower c n pfass than the higher c n pfass additionally for a given blr the rate of pfas leaching was found to be largely insensitive to the rate constant used figs s4 and s5 even when its value is varied by two orders of magnitude table s6 this lack of sensitivity is attributed to 1 the generally high k des of the biosolids amended soils 2 the relatively small fraction of rate limited sites associated with these same soils f 2 0 16 in this case and 3 the low concentration gradients associated with low pfas leachate concentrations which limit the driving force for mass transfer to the rate limited sites the limited influence of sorption desorption kinetics on the leaching of pfas from shallow source zones for observed for the 15 year simulations performed here is consistent with a prior long term leaching evaluation kuntz and grathwohl 2009 these results demonstrate that equilibrium sorption would be an appropriate transport model simplification for sites k and w this result is significant because it suggests that when biosolids are applied to surface soils at typical agronomic loading rates predicted rates of pfas mass loss from the surficial soil source are more dependent on an accurate characterization of the equilibrium sorption desorption parameters than on non equilibrium parameters 3 2 vadose zone hydrodynamics vadose zone hydrodynamics are indicative of the interplay between changes in soil moisture and other soil hydraulic and physical properties infiltrating precipitation increases θ w resulting in a corresponding increase in unsaturated hydraulic conductivity k unsat the downward flux of water q the volume of water per unit area per time and contaminant mass changes in θ w vary spatially and temporally within the vadose zone resulting in the transient character of the hydraulic properties profiles fig 2 similarly changes in θ w result in concomitant changes in a aw e g silva et al 2022 which governs the amount of pfas mass adsorbed at awis and thereby regulates the mass flux of contaminants within the vadose zone for site k the pfas source zone and the underlying vadose zone share the same hydraulic properties but different transport characteristics i e soil sorption desorption coefficients and rate constants hydraulically site k is modeled as a homogeneous system and the response observed in the parameters in fig 2 reflects this homogeneity k unsat values are periodically very low near the soil surface due to low θ w due to evaporation however k unsat generally ranges between 0 01 and 1 cm day below the surface this is well below the saturated conductivity 21 2 cm day of this silty sandy soil and q is thus more variable in this system and more dependent on precipitation variability this well drained soil provides a lower pseudo steady state moisture content that yields elevated a aw values ranging between 200 and 400 cm2 cm3 and promotes more significant retention via awi adsorption in the upper vadose zone relative to site w see below the vadose zone at site w is texturally and hydraulically heterogeneous the loamy pfas source zone retains more soil moisture during the simulation period which is shown in the uppermost layer of fig 2g generally θ w is shown to increase in time within individual strata resulting in independent inter layer changes in a aw values the general increase in retained moisture increases k unsat values within the system resulting in a reasonably uniform k unsat distribution vertically due to the higher overall θ w k unsat in site w soils can more readily approach the saturated hydraulic conductivity the pseudo steady state flux of water in the site w vadose zone is also generally vertically uniform although the water flux is still lower in the site w vadose zone than in the site k vadose zone however incidents of greater than average rainfall can significantly increase q in this system i e note the significant increase in q at year 15 fig 2f given the hydraulic and sorption heterogeneity pfas would be expected to transport more slowly in the vadose zone at site w vs site k and the transport rate will be less sharply affected by precipitation patterns leaching of pfas from the source zone would also be expected to be slowed due to the hydraulic limitations of the underlying strata 3 3 significance of pfas awi adsorption awi adsorption can play a significant role in regulating the rate of pfas transport in the vadose zone however this was not the case within the biosolids amended source zones of sites k and w regardless of whether awi adsorption was or was not considered in these simulations the overall rate of pfas leaching from the biosolids amended soil source zone into the vadose zone does not change at either site fig 3 these results again demonstrate the dominance of soil sorption desorption processes on pfas leaching from the surficial source soils in these simulated cases note again the fluctuating c w values in simulations that considered awi adsorption compared to smooth changes in c w values when awi adsorption was neglected this is because awi adsorption depends on changes in θ w and awi area while soil sorption does not infiltrating water increases θ w and reduces awi area producing the release of pfas from awi to the soil solution on the other hand evaporation decreases θ w and increases awi area producing the mass transfer of pfas from the soil solution to awi the effect of awi adsorption on the simulated transport of pfas within the entire vadose zone is shown in figs 4 and 5 for sites k and w respectively for the less surface active pfas awi adsorption does not significantly contribute to transport at either site however as the surface activity of the solute increases awi adsorption plays a more significant role in the retention of these solutes for example at the more homogeneous site k transport of pfoa is observed to be moderately accelerated and the transport of pfos is significantly accelerated when awi adsorption is not considered in the model the effect is not nearly as contributive at the texturally heterogeneous site w while clear differences exist in the rate of change of pfas concentrations in the upper part of the vadose zone after 15 years pfoa concentrations contacting the saturated zone are not significantly different whether awi adsorption is considered or not likewise after 15 simulated years pfos at site w has not contacted the saturated zone and has transported to essentially the same depth i e 265 cm regardless of whether awi adsorption is considered assuming equivalent meteorological inputs the significance of awi adsorption on the overall transport of surface active solutes is dependent on three primary factors 1 the degree of affinity for the solid phase as demonstrated for the biosolids amended soils 2 the surface activity of the solute i e an affinity for the awi and 3 the magnitude of a aw as it changes during infiltration events i e higher a aw values associated with lower water content values provide increased awi adsorption and retention of surface active solutes factor 3 is strongly influenced by textural heterogeneity at site k the modeled soil textural homogeneity of the vadose zone soils allows for the establishment of a smaller pseudo steady state θ w condition that promotes awi adsorption in the upper vadose zone fig 2 by maintaining higher a aw in the absence of awi adsorption transport occurs much faster because transport is now dependent only on the hydraulic properties of the media and interactions with the solid phase at site w the modeled soil textural heterogeneity limits the contribution of awi adsorption because the soils beneath the biosolids amended source zone maintain a higher θ w and as a result lower a aw awi adsorption is therefore not significant in the upper site w vadose zone and does not contribute significantly to the retention of pfas in this system at site w pfas transport is dominated by interactions with the soils and the hydraulics of unsaturated flow these results demonstrate how soil textural heterogeneity can under certain conditions play a more important role than awi adsorption in determining the magnitude and rate of pfas transport in the vadose zone even for more surface active pfas e g pfos in these cases the downward coarsening sequence of soil layering present at site w fig s2 promotes this heterogeneity imposed hydraulic control on pfas transport alternatively if the soils beneath the topsoil were coarser e g sand steady state soil moisture would likely be lower within that underlying coarse layer and a aw values would be much higher see a aw θ w curves fig s3c and awi adsorption would play a greater role in pfas retention however hydraulic conditions within the site w loam topsoil would still limit the rate and magnitude of leaching in this case because of the intermittent release of pfas from that source soil due to the capillary barrier effect i e infiltrating precipitation would need to build up enough hydraulic head at the loam sand interface to overcome the suction in that layer and initiate flow within the underlying sand further the flux of water entering the coarser media would be limited by the overall lower hydraulic conductivity of the surface soil therefore soil textural heterogeneity should be considered carefully when simulating pfas leaching in the vadose zone 3 4 leaching of pfas from a land applied biosolids source 3 4 1 single event biosolids application to better evaluate pfas leaching in these systems pfas transport in the vadose zone was simulated for a single biosolids application over a longer simulated time period an example of the simulated arrival of pfas at the top of the capillary fringe at both test sites is presented in fig 6 for blr 50 mg ha immediately apparent in fig 6 are the differences in the time needed for these pfas to reach the saturated zone the less surface active pfas i e pfhxa pfhpa pfoa pfhxs are generally less retained by soil interactions and awi adsorption in these systems and therefore move more rapidly through the vadose zone however the higher c n pfas i e pfna pfda and pfos in this case are more surface active and sorbing and are considerably more retained requiring many decades to transport to the saturated zone and impact groundwater resources the times required to achieve maximum pfas concentrations are also remarkable with pfos shown to require 60 years to reach a peak concentration at the top of the saturated zone at site k and 109 years at site w cumulative mass flux cmf plots additionally demonstrate the differences in arrival times for pfas represented in this work fig 6 cmf values are presented using hectares as the areal dimension to be consistent with units used for the blrs and are useful as input datasets i e source terms for groundwater i e saturated zone modeling efforts the time to approach maximal cmf reflects the transport characteristics of the individual pfas and the magnitude of the maximum cmf achieved reflects the initial pfas mass loading within the source zone for a given blr for these sites the maximal cumulative pfas mass flux entering the saturated zone was 1 to 100 g per hectare of biosolids amended land but in some cases required several decades to reach that loading expanding this evaluation simulations were performed for additional single event biosolids applications at blrs of 5 10 25 50 and 100 mg ha the results of these simulations for pfoa and pfos are presented in fig 7 simulated maximum or peak leachate concentrations reaching the saturated zone c w max for all pfas evaluated herein table s7 increased linearly with increasing blr for all pfas evaluated consistent with the use of a linear loading rate model used to parameterize pfas mass input in the simulator eq 1 the slope of the blr c w max regression can be used to directly estimate the maximum blr for a given site and pfas however because the pfas mass associated with the applied biosolids can change from source to source and over time it is more practical to represent predicted c w max values as a function of s bs pfas e g pfoa and pfos in fig 8 s bs pfas values were calculated using eq 1 and the values for all pfas included in this evaluation are presented in table s8 the slopes of the linear regressions of this data are likewise provided in table s9 these data can then be used to directly estimate c w max values for these sites and simulated conditions if s bs pfas is determined for a given biosolids application 3 4 2 multiple biosolids applications in practice biosolids are often applied annually over multi year cycles as was the case for test sites k and w higgins et al 2011 therefore additional simulations were performed to examine the effect of multi year biosolids applications on maximum pfas concentrations in leachate reaching the saturated zone lower and more agronomic blr s of 5 10 and 25 mg ha and annual biosolids re application periods t app of 1 3 5 and 10 years were used in these simulations the remaining conditions and parameters were the same as in previous simulations examples of the simulated arrival of pfoa and pfos at different application periods are presented in fig 9 for both test sites additionally simulated c w max values for pfoa and pfos resulting from the various application periods and loading rates are provided in fig 10 as shown in fig 10 simulated c w max was observed to increase nonlinearly with t app and a 2nd order polynomial regression equation forced through the origin was used to represent the trend in the data for the t app c w max relationships the degree of non linearity increased with increasing blr which is most clearly observed in pfoa results e g fig 10a and c but is also evident in fig 9 where the leading edge of the pfoa arrival profiles are coincident which indicates the initial pfas arrival times are independent of t app for a given blr similar to increasing the blr multiple annual biosolids applications increase the pfas c w max reaching the groundwater table however multiple annual applications ultimately provide a greater c w max values for a given blr due to the re application of a fresh source of pfas that increases the pfas mass within the surface soils i e s bs pfas and in the leachate these results indicate a practical limit for biosolids applications in agriculture would need to be derived to be protective of underlying groundwater resources like regression equations presented in figs 7 and 8 those provided in fig 10 could also be used to estimate c w max for pfas at different values of t app and for the blr and associated s bs pfas values applied however a unifying predictive relationship is preferred to include the impacts of both s bs pfas and t app for an individual site to this end the slope values of the linear sbs pfas cw max regressions table s9 were regressed against t app and fit using a 2nd order polynomial regression equation forced through the origin these m t app relationships were then used in combination with sbs pfas cw max regression equations to derive the following polynomial expression that allows the prediction of c w max for various combinations of s bs pfas and t app as 2 c w max s bs pfas a 1 t app 2 a 2 t app where a 1 and a 2 are regression coefficients for the pfas of interest table 1 this approach was used for both sites as proposed eq 2 is site specific and additionally dependent on the linearity of s bs pfas with changes in blr for the biosolids applied therefore additional model simulations would need to be performed for a given site to derive new site specific a 1 and a 2 parameters however once derived eq 2 could be applied to the development of site specific pfas soil screening levels and or maximum leachate levels for pfas for proposed s bs pfas and t app to develop best management practices bmps for land application of biosolids 3 5 implications for groundwater contamination the usepa recommended the use of 70 ng l for pfoa and pfos i e individual or combined as the preliminary remediation goal prg for groundwater contaminated by pfas which is a current or potential source of drinking water for sites where state or local metrics have not been adopted usepa 2019 if this same metric is used to define maximum allowable leaching levels for pfoa and pfos the allowable leaching level is shown to have been exceeded at site k and site w for a single blr of 50 mg ha fig 8 likewise this prg is met or exceeded for several multi year applications shown in figs 9 and 10 however more typically the prg of 70 ng l would be for pfoa and pfos arriving or produced at a down gradient receptor point e g a surface water body or groundwater well therefore depending on the distance between the receptor and the biosolids application area attenuation processes may allow pfas leachate concentrations immediately beneath the biosolids application site to be in excess of 70 ng l well known analytical solutions for solute transport e g domenico 1987 have been incorporated into various analytical models to allow the estimation of dilution attenuation factors daf at user defined distances from the source of contamination e g nevin et al 1997 usepa 2000 using the domenico model for a sorbing and non decaying solute section s3 and relevant site specific inputs for these sites daf values were calculated for pfoa and pfos at site k table 2 the daf value was used to determine c w max for a 70 ng l arrival at a given receptor distance from the source in turn these c w max values were used to determine the corresponding s bs pfas values for pfoa and pfos using the linear regression and slope values described above table s9 these s bs pfas values would then be the maximum values or potential site specific soil screening levels ssl for pfoa and pfos that represent the maximum pfas mass per unit mass of soil that could be applied to the land surface either in a single event or accumulated or over multiple application events to avoid exceeding the 70 ng l prg at a distant receptor for example a receptor positioned 500 ft ft downgradient of site k would see pfoa and pfos concentrations exceed the 70 ng l limit when s bs pfoa and s bs pfos at site k exceed 4 32 and 48 9 μg kg respectively or when the cumulative blr in each case exceeds 288 and 247 mg ha respectively given the significant amount of time needed for pfoa and pfos transport in the vadose zone and the arrival of the peak concentration at the saturated zone the potential for prg exceedances at potential receptors should additionally be considered in both the nearer term i e based on pfoa peak arrival times and in the much longer term i e based on peak pfos peak arrival as maximum solution concentrations at the receptors could occur many decades after initial biosolids application regarding the continued and long term use of biosolids at these sites the simulated results of this work suggest biosolids application should be a strictly managed activity in a manner consistent with the management methods outlined in usepa 40 cfr part 503 for metals the blr values greater than those in table 2 would result in exceedances of the 70 ng l leachate level for pfas at different receptor distances at site k however given the longevity of biosolids as a source of pfas and the significant times involved in pfas contamination of groundwater for these sites the same blr s bs pfas values may also be the practical upper lifetime limit of biosolids application for these sites concentrations of pfas of current regulatory concern e g pfoa and pfos in municipal biosolids will vary between source municipalities and could ultimately diminish over time as these compounds are phased out of consumer products additionally methods to treat the biosolids to reduce pfas concentrations prior to land application should be evaluated any reduction of the pfas mass loading will extend the beneficial and safe use of these products for agricultural applications the usepa recently updated its lifetime drinking water health advisory limit for pfoa and pfos to 0 004 ng l and 0 02 ng l respectively usepa 2022 however at the time of this publication it is unclear whether the prg has also been updated to what degree these recommended advisory levels will be adapted as state level regulatory limits and whether analytical methods will be developed that can routinely and reliably evaluate these levels in drinking water regardless the approach and methods described in this current evaluation could prove useful to agricultural practitioners management as these environmental regulatory metrics change in the future to reflect new toxicity data and regulation of additional pfas 4 conclusions because pfas are present in land applied municipal biosolids it is important to understand the fate and transport of these contaminants in the vadose zone to assess the potential for groundwater contamination in this work numerical simulations were employed to evaluate the significance of land applied biosolids as a long term source of pfas in agricultural applications under natural infiltration conditions using flow and pfas specific transport parameters derived from existing site information or the literature simulations were performed for two test sites located in the same climatic zone with differing vadose zone hydrostratigraphy results of these simulations demonstrated the following within the biosolids amended pfas source soil sorption desorption processes were the dominant retention mechanisms for pfas with rate limited desorption contributing minimally to the overall release rate of pfas from the source this result is significant because it suggests that over the long term rates of pfas mass loss from the surficial biosolids amended soil source are most dependent on the accurate characterization of the equilibrium soil interaction parameters than on those for non equilibrium processes this in turn simplifies leaching calculations while awi adsorption can be an important process for retaining pfas in the vadose zone this process did not contribute significantly to the overall release rate of pfas from the biosolids amended source soils at either test site climate conditions at these sites provided persistently elevated soil moisture conditions and correspondingly lower a aw values within these surface soils that minimized the contribution of awi adsorption within the vadose zone soils underlying biosolids amended source soils awi adsorption was observed to be most contributive to the retention of pfas at site k where the vadose zone was characterized and modeled as a predominantly homogeneous vadose zone of silty sand at site k lower moisture conditions and thus larger a aw values were maintained throughout the 150 year simulation period this condition allowed awi adsorption to play a more significant role in limiting the rate of pfas transport to groundwater particularly for the more surface active pfas in contrast textural heterogeneities and finer grained soils at site w collectively minimized the role of awi adsorption resulting in faster transport to groundwater for the same pfas source condition even with an overall lower unsaturated hydraulic conductivity finer grained soils comprising the upper vadose zone at site w retained more moisture throughout the period of simulation resulting in lower a aw values and less overall retention of pfas these results are consistent with prior work highlighting the impact of vadose zone hydrostratigraphy on the significance of awi adsorption as a mechanism for pfas retention during leaching from a surficial source silva et al 2020 individual pfas leach from a biosolids source transport through the vadose zone at different rates and reach the saturated zone at different times for linear perfluoroalkyl pfas employed herein the rate of transport is dependent on the pfas c n which impacts its surface activity and the interaction with the soil solid phase and its surface activity for two of the pfas of federal regulatory concern used here i e pfoa and pfos peak concentrations arrive at the saturated zone many decades apart fig 7 this requires treating pfoa and pfos separately when applying usepa guidance on pfas limits for groundwater increasing the blr at both sites increased pfas concentrations in the leachate but did not impact the rate of release from the source zone increasing the number of annual biosolids application events also increased pfas concentrations but did not significantly affect the rate of transport of individual pfas through the vadose zone however it did increase the overall mass of pfas leaching through the soil for a given blr peak pfas concentrations reaching the saturated zone increased linearly with increasing blr and increased nonlinearly with increasing biosolids re application at a given blr the results of these simulations were used to develop an empirical equation eq 2 that was in turn used to directly evaluate the impact of biosolids amended soil pfas loading rates and annual re application periods on pfas leaching concentrations for a given test site this approach could be useful in developing site specific soil screening levels for pfas in support of bmps for land application of biosolids containing pfas at additional sites likewise an up scaled version of this approach could be used to develop state or county level soil screening levels for generic soil conditions most common in areas where biosolids land application sites are present example soil screening calculations for site k table 2 also demonstrate that the numerical modeling approach used here can support the continued safe use of biosolids with respect to managing impacts related to pfas and groundwater contamination in a manner consistent with the methods outlined in usepa 40 cfr part 503 for other biosolid specific contaminants in this work it was assumed that a finite mass of pfas was applied as either a single application or as incremental additions associated with an annual biosolids application however recent investigations have shown the potential for degradation of pfas precursor compounds within land applied biosolids that could be represented as an additional source of some pfas over the time scales represented herein roehler et al 2021 for the current case this additional source of pfas could impact the magnitude of c w max values and breakthrough profiles in figs 7 and 10 would plateau at a different c w max for those pfas being produced given that the rates and duration of pfas production can be characterized such a source of pfas could be simulated as an in situ production process within the source zone as was done in our prior work silva et al 2020 however simulated pfas arrival times and the general approach proposed here to estabilish soil screening levels and assist management of pfas loading rates for biosolids application remain appropriate credit authorship contribution statement jeff a k silva conceptualization methodology validation formal analysis

1254,degradation of 7 common pesticides bentazon boscalid chloridazon fluopyram flutolanil imidacloprid and methoxyfenozide and 2 metabolites of chloridazon desphenyl chloridazon and methyl desphenyl chloridazon was studied in an anoxic and brackish sandy aquifer before and during aquifer storage transfer and recovery astr operation fresh tile drainage water was injected and stored for later re use as irrigation water we hypothesized that electron acceptors o2 no3 dissolved organic carbon 24 7 mg l nutrients no3 14 1 mg l nh4 0 13 mg l po4 5 2 mg l and biodegrading bacteria in tile drainage water could stimulate degradation of the pesticides and metabolites ranging between 0 013 and 10 8 μg l introduced in the aquifer pesticide degradation was studied at 6 depths in the aquifer using push pull tests lasting 18 days before the onset of astr operation degradation was too limited to quantify and or could not be assessed because of the potential occurrence of pesticide retardation utilizing push pull tests to obtain degradation constants should only be considered in future studies for non retarding pesticides with relative low half lives here 20 days during astr operation pesticide degradation was studied at the same depths during 3 storage periods equally spread over 1 5 years of astr operation overall trends of degradation were observed although with relatively high half lives of at least 53 days microbial adaptation of the aquifer and or bioaugmentation by the injected biodegrading bacteria did not result in enhanced degradation during consecutive storage periods operational monitoring data over longer periods and distances yielded half lives of at least 141 days the slow degradation mostly agrees with previous studies the injected tile drainage water composition did therefore not notably stimulate pesticide degradation the relatively persistent behavior of the studied pesticides metabolites implies that astr abstracted water will have generally high pesticide concentrations and non abstracted water may form a contamination risk for the surrounding native brackish groundwater graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords managed aquifer

or as in the current study tile drainage water from agricultural lands kruisdijk and van breukelen 2021 tile drainage water originates from an agricultural drainage system which is designed to remove excess water in agricultural fields via subsurface pipes this system optimizes crop growth and prevents rotting and crop death residence and transport of infiltrated water in aquifers is known to often improve water quality during mar e g bekele et al 2018 dillon et al 2003 in the current study we assessed the degradation rates of pesticides and metabolites as introduced with tile drainage water during mar operation in order to better assess the risks for groundwater contamination pesticide degradation depends on the physicochemical characteristics of the pesticide arias estevez et al 2008 fenner et al 2013 its initial concentration baumgarten et al 2011 oberleitner et al 2020 and aquifer conditions such as temperature munz et al 2019 storck et al 2012 ph arias estévez et al 2008

composition bertelkamp et al 2016a regnery et al 2015 greskowiak et al 2017 compared biodegradation rate constants of 82 emerging organic compounds of which 8 pesticides from 48 studies and observed that most of the rate constants vary over 3 orders of magnitude this indicates the large impact of the above mentioned conditions on pesticide degradation microbial adaptation is another factor influencing pesticide degradation it is defined as the time needed for the microbial population to adjust to a new introduced chemical alexander 1999 adaptation times can vary between a few hours to several years alexander 1999 baumgarten et al 2011 but generally do not exceed 6 months hoppe jones et al 2012 during this time the microbial community changes in composition and or in abundances furthermore biodegradation can be enhanced by introducing new types of bacteria as naturally part of the infiltration water to the aquifer during mar e g bioaugmentation microbial adaptation and bioaugmentation are both often indicated by increasing pesticide degradation rates over time fetter et al 1999 hoppe jones et al 2012 degradation of pesticides or other organic micro pollutants have

recovery asr sites e g page et al 2014 stuyfzand et al 2007 many of these studies focused on mar systems with travel times up to several years which permitted the use of averaged input levels as water composition was substantially homogenized during aquifer transport wiese et al 2011 this approach is not suitable for smaller scale systems as in the current study as aquifer travel times between injection and abstraction can be relatively short in the order of days to weeks and concentrations of the injected water can fluctuate considerably huntscha et al 2013 aquifer storage transfer and recovery astr is one of the various methods of mar wherein water is stored in an aquifer during wet periods via well injection and abstracted from another well when needed in the current study we monitored an astr system in which fresh tile drainage water is collected from an agricultural parcel during wet periods injected and stored in the originally brackish coastal aquifer and abstracted when needed e g during droughts for irrigation purposes on the same plot we focused on the degradation of 7 common pesticides and 2 metabolites the current research is a follow up on the research performed by kruisdijk et al 2022 they studied pesticide sorption during astr in the same aquifer as the current study the obtained sorption parameters in kruisdijk et al 2022 were used in the analysis of the current research which is appropriate as about the same set of pesticides was studied at the same depths we hypothesized that conditions in the current mar application are favorable for pesticide degradation as injected tile drainage water contains electron acceptors e g o2 no3 nutrients doc and likely biodegrading bacteria besides the injected pesticides and metabolites these factors can stimulate biodegradation aldas vargas et al 2021 luo et al 2019 while in oligotrophic groundwater systems biodegradation is often limited due to limited carbon and nutrient sources egli 2010 push pull tests were performed to assess pesticide degradation in the native aquifer before the start of astr operation furthermore pesticide degradation was monitored during three storage periods of astr operation and by periodical operational monitoring the research objectives of the current study were to i determine degradation rate constants for several pesticides and metabolites at 6 different depths within the aquifer to better assess the risks for groundwater contamination during mar ii assess if degradation rate constants increase over time in subsequent storage periods due to microbial adaptation and or bioaugmentation iii compare the obtained degradation rate constants to those obtained for similar groundwater systems to assess if the injection of aerobic nutrient and doc rich and microbially active tile drainage water favors pesticide degradation and iv assess the utility of push pull tests to assess pesticide degradation in mar systems 2 methods 2 1 field site description pesticide degradation was examined in an aquifer storage transfer and recovery astr system for agricultural use in the north western part of the netherlands coordinates 52 8883 4 8221 injected water is collected from a tile drainage network approximately 1 m below the 10 ha agricultural parcel fig 1 tile drainage water in this network ends up in a collection drain from where it is discharged to the astr system the collected tile drainage water is injected in the aquifer by 2 wells well screens ranging from 11 5 to 33 0 m below surface level b s l injection well a and b the water can be retrieved by 4 abstraction wells well screens ranging from 12 0 to 23 0 m b s l in periods of drought and re used for crop irrigation a holocene peaty clay layer confines the target aquifer ranging from surface level to about 10 m b s l the sandy aquifer itself is of late pleistocene and holocene origin and reaches to about 45 m b s l for monitoring purposes 2 sets of 6 piezometers 1 in diameter were constructed at 2 5 m monitoring well mw 1 6 and at about 15 m mw b1 b6 distance from injection well a fig 1 kruisdijk et al 2022 studied pesticide sorption at the same monitoring wells mw1 6 and observed that the hydraulic conductivity was highest at the well screen depth of mw4 moderate at mw3 and 5 and relatively low at mw1 2 and 6 2 2 overview of study and astr operation fig 2 shows an overview of the total injected volumes during astr operation before the start of astr operation push pull tests were performed from 25 february till 18 march 2019 astr operation started with the injection of 2700 m3 water in the first operation period during operation period 2 and 3 2900 and 4300 m3 of water were injected respectively storage periods took place after each operation period in winter 2019 from 19 december 2019 to 2 february 2020 fall 2020 from 14 october 2020 to 24 november 2020 and spring 2021 from 18 march 2021 to 03 may 2021 2 3 push pull tests 2 3 1 method push pull tests consist of a push phase during which water with a known quality is injected through a groundwater well and a subsequent pull phase during which the injected water is gradually abstracted abstracted water is periodically sampled after which the water quality changes of these samples were assessed push pull tests were performed in 6 monitoring wells mw1 6 located at different depths ranging from 11 4 to 32 2 m b s l table 1 samples from the native groundwater were taken before the start of the push pull tests injection water consisted of approximately 300 l tile drainage water to which 0 1 mmol l br as nabr was added as a conservative tracer and a solution with pesticides and metabolites selected on the basis of a multi criteria analysis for more information see kruisdijk et al 2022 the reactant solution was prepared in advance and consisted of the pesticides bentazon boscalid chloridazon fluopyram flutolanil imidacloprid methoxyfenozide and the metabolites of chloridazon desphenyl chloridazon d chloridazon and methyl desphenyl chloridazon md chloridazon approximately 9 mg of each pesticide was added to 6 l of distilled water next the solution was mixed for 48 h using a magnetic stir plate a small coagulate of the reactants developed in the bottle which was removed from the solution therefore final reactant concentrations were somewhat lower than aimed at lastly the obtained solution was divided over 6 glass bottles of 1 l one bottle for each monitoring well this would result in a maximum concentration of 5 μg l when added to the 300 l tile drainage water obtained from the collection drain which fits inside the typical range of pesticide concentrations observed in tile drainage water observed in the current study see table 1 for each monitoring well a storage tank containing tile drainage water plus reactants was prepared in the storage tank the tile drainage water was thoroughly mixed manually with a pole after adding the pesticide solutions water in the storage tank was injected using a peristaltic pump eijkelkamp the netherlands through each of the 6 monitoring wells in approximately 2 5 h with a steady flow of about 2 l min push phase four water samples were taken of the injected water equally spread over time during the pull phase the period in between sampling was for the first samples 4 h but gradually increased until maximum three days in between the last samples the total push pull test duration was 17 or 18 days during which 14 water samples were taken during the first 12 samples 360 l water was abstracted 12 30 l 30 l is substantially more than the max standing well volume of 17 l on the last day a total of 120 l was abstracted during which 2 water samples were collected after abstraction of 60 and 120 l 2 3 2 data analysis first order degradation rate constants k were determined based on the well mixed reactor model haggerty et al 1998 which was successfully used in previous studies e g huntscha et al 2013 kruisdijk and van breukelen 2021 vandenbohede et al 2008 this model is shown to be accurate when the push phase takes substantially less time than the pull phase which is valid in our case push phase 2 5 h pull phase 400 h to assess the significance of the calculated rate constants 95 confidence limits were calculated from the variance of the degradation rate constants schroth et al 2000 first order reaction rate constants were estimated based on eq 1 developed by haggerty et al 1998 which is valid if the retardation factors of the tracer and reactants are identical 1 ln c r t c tr t ln 1 e k t inj k t inj k t where c r t and c tr t are normalized concentrations of respectively the reactant and the tracer at time t days k is the first order reaction rate constant of the reactant day 1 t inj is the duration of the push phase days and t is the time elapsed since the push phase days br was used as the tracer for mw1 mw4 unfortunately br concentrations in injected water 8 2 9 6 mg l were relatively close to the native groundwater concentrations at mw 5 and mw 6 7 2 and 13 0 mg l respectively cl concentrations varied more distinctly between injected 255 436 mg l and native groundwater for mw 5 and mw 6 1780 and 3170 mg l respectively and was used as the tracer at these depths rate constants were estimated by fitting a regression line to a plot of ln c r t c tr t versus t which generates a line with a slope k only the water samples were used where c tr t 0 2 we assumed that assessing water samples where c tr t 0 2 resulted in larger uncertainties as i lower c tr t infers that a larger part of the abstracted water originates from native groundwater which means that the tracer and reactant concentrations become lower and measurement errors increasingly influence the obtained k and ii tracer concentrations in groundwater are not 100 homogeneous which leads to higher uncertainties for lower c tr t normalized concentrations were calculated for tracer and reactants following eq 2 2 c tr c tr c gw c inf c gw c r c r c 1 st sample where c tr is the tracer concentration during the pull phase mg l c gw the concentration in native groundwater mg l c inf the mean concentration of the 4 samples taken during injection mg l c r the reactant concentration during the pull phase mg l and c 1 st sample the concentration of the first abstracted sample during the pull phase mg l different equations were used for the normalized concentrations of the tracer and the reactants because we observed unexpectedly higher concentrations in the first samples of the pull phase than in the injection phase for some of the reactants this suggests that the total concentration of the added reactant was not fully analyzed during the injection phase for which we cannot provide a clear explanation therefore we used c 1 st sample for the reactants instead of c inf c gw was 0 for the reactants and could therefore be neglected a nonlinear least squares routine was used to fit eq 1 to the observed concentrations in python python v 3 6 4 the influence of pesticide retardation on the push pull test breakthrough

during the push pull tests before aquifer storage transfer and recovery astr operation push pull tests were conducted to assess the initial capacity of the native anoxic brackish aquifer to degrade pesticides and metabolites in injected tile drainage water tile drainage water was injected at 6 different depths via the monitoring wells 1 6 mw1 6 located at 2 5 m from injection well a during the push phase of the push pull tests fig 1 injected tile drainage water had o2 concentrations ranging from 5 4 to 9 6 mg l dissolved organic carbon doc concentrations between 20 8 and 23 8 mg l and relatively high nutrient concentrations no3 41 1 49 7 mg l po4 6 54 9 98 mg l nh4 0 04 0 85 mg l water temperature ranged from 7 0 to 14 4 c and ph from 7 2 to 8 0 table 1 shows the native groundwater composition at the well screen depths of mw1 6 before the push pull tests and astr operation the native groundwater was anoxic o2 and no3 below detection limit with mainly mn iv and fe iii reducing conditions based on the relatively high concentrations of mn ii and fe ii respectively table 1 the shallow part of the aquifer was relatively fresh electrical conductivity ec at mw1 2 and 3 11 4 19 3 m below surface was between 1850 and 2000 μs cm and turned more saline with depth ec at mw4 5 and 6 22 78 32 2 m below surface was 3280 5090 and 8930 μs cm respectively during the pull phase of the push pull tests redox conditions changed rapidly in the abstracted water as shown in more detail in s3 2 injected water became anoxic within 1 day of residence in the aquifer and subsequently no3 reducing conditions were observed at all depths furthermore reductive dissolution of fe and mn oxides probably occurred so4 reduction was not observed except at mw2 any degradation of pesticides and metabolites thus occurred at about neutral ph under mostly no3 and or metal oxide reducing conditions during the push pull tests 3 1 2 observed pesticide degradation during the push pull tests fig 3 shows the push pull test results of fluopyram for a selection of depths the classes stated in the labels will be explained later in this section the results are shown for the other depths and pesticides metabolites in s3 3 in the left panels concentrations of the tracer br or cl and fluopyram gradually decreased because of dispersive mixing with native groundwater during the abstraction phase of the push pull tests except for mw5 and mw6 s3 3 where cl concentrations were higher in native groundwater compared to injected tile drainage water due to the higher salinity at larger depths in the aquifer similar trends were observed for the normalized concentrations in the middle panels where the occurrence of degradation was suggested by a faster decline of normalized fluopyram concentrations compared to those of the conservative tracer in the right panel linear regression was performed on the natural logarithm of the normalized fluopyram concentrations divided by the normalized tracer over time from which the first order degradation rate constants and half lives dt50 were estimated by eq 1 the calculated 95 confidence intervals were used to denominate the obtained k values as statistically significant when they excluded k 0 3 1 2 1 influences of retardation on obtained dt50 the performed method is only valid when retardation is assumed negligible as pesticide retardation can also result in decreasing pesticide concentrations which can influence the estimated dt50 value schroth et al 2000 degradation is indicated by normalized pesticide concentrations lower than those of the conservative tracer during the entire pull phase haggerty et al 1998 whereas sorption is indicated by initially lower concentrations until the arrival of the 50 front position i e where the normalized tracer concentration 0 5 followed by higher concentrations afterwards schroth et al 2000 see s3 1 analytical solutions are not available which can disentangle sorption from degradation kruisdijk et al 2022 obtained retardation factors r of about the same set of pesticides and metabolites at the same depths in the aquifer for a short description of the method see s3 4 most 32 out of 38 r values range between 0 8 and 2 0 table 2 the highest r values were observed at the top of the aquifer and generally decreased with depth which corresponded with the higher sedimentary organic matter contents at the top of the aquifer compared to the bottom before the onset of the push pull tests we simulated the influence of pesticide retardation on the push pull test breakthrough curves using eqs 3 and 4 schroth et al 2000 stated that methodological errors of 14 could be expected in a physically and chemically homogeneous aquifer by using these equations however errors could be larger under more heterogeneous conditions the variation in pesticide concentrations was 5 1 relative concentration when r 2 relative concentration when r 1 100 when estimating pesticide concentrations by r 2 compared to r 1 s3 1 based on these outcomes we did not expect major interferences from pesticide retardation in the current study to examine the actual influence of sorption in the obtained data during the push pull tests we first visually examined the trends observed in the figs s3 11 in s3 3 and categorized these trends in 5 classes table 2 1 the reactant behaves similarly as the conservative tracer or the reactant acts differently due to 2 degradation 3 sorption 4 unknown reasons e g scattered concentrations or 5 sorption or degradation no clear distinction fig 3 shows an example of the categorization of the push pull test results for a selection of depths of fluopyram where the trend at mw1 was categorized as sorption class 3 at mw2 as degradation class 2 and at mw5 as similar to the conservative tracer class 1 table 2 presents the estimated dt50 values the results of the qualitative assessment and the retardation factors obtained from kruisdijk et al 2022 kruisdijk et al 2022 observed r 1 at 2 depths for a few pesticides the mechanism behind the r 1 remained unclear although a relation with doc associated transport seemed unlikely most estimated dt50 values were positive 51 out of 64 negative dt50 values were observed during the push pull tests but were all insignificant significant dt50 values 39 out of 64 ranged from 5 2 to 45 days at mw1 all pesticide and metabolite concentration trends resembled those associated with sorption this corresponds with the retardation factors in table 1 which show that pesticide sorption was most substantial at mw1 compared to the other depths nevertheless sorption influences were not only observed if r 2 0 as suggested by the calculations using eq 3 s3 1 but also for r 1 3 d chloridazon and r 1 5 md chloridazon at mw1 at the other depths the influence of sorption was observed for 7 pesticides metabolites where r was lower than 2 and was even observed when r was estimated about equal to 1 this shows that sorption played a substantially bigger role than expected based on the analytical equation of schroth et al 2000 which is additionally shown by the relatively large occurrence of the sorption related class 3 31 the discrepancy between the analytical solution and the observed results is probably resulting from physical or chemical heterogeneity of the aquifer layers in the current study which schroth et al 2000 stated as a drawback of this method this made it impossible to estimate a realistic dt50 value for the pesticides and metabolites which were influenced by sorption 3 1 2 2 outcomes push pull tests the orange cells represent class 2 where a clear pesticide degradation trend was observed remarkably such a degradation trend was only observed for 5 pesticides metabolites chloridazon md chloridazon fluopyram imidacloprid and methoxyfenozide and only at mw2 these trends represented some of the lowest dt50 values 5 2 13 days we question these degradation trends observed at mw2 as i we deem it unlikely that degradation only occurred at this depth for no apparent reason ii no influences of sorption are observed while the r values are only slightly lower compared to mw1 and iii the results do not agree with the results obtained during the storage periods section 3 2 nevertheless no clear explanation can be given for the observed trends observed at mw2 despite degradation dt50 values were also estimated for class 1 the class in which pesticides and metabolites visually act similar as the conservative tracer in class 1 the minimum positive dt50 value was 23 days estimated dt50 values 20 days seem highly uncertain as these dt50 values are substantially larger than the durations of the push pull tests 7 12 days which makes it troublesome to disentangle degradation and the scatter of pesticide concentrations in the current study the obtained dt50 have a relatively low reliability due to the unexpected effects of pesticide retardation and the relatively short time span of the push pull tests in combination with the mostly high dt50 obtained we learned that push pull tests are only useful when pesticide degradation is relatively fast here dt50 values 20 days and pesticide retardation is negligible huntscha et al 2013 successfully obtained first order degradation rate constants using push pull tests but studied non retarding organic micropollutants which degraded much faster k values in order of hour 1 from the data in the current study we can conclude that degradation could have occurred for some pesticides and metabolites at mw2 before the start of astr operation but generally it did not or was too small to observe dt50 values 20 days 3 2 pesticide degradation during storage periods of astr operation 3 2 1 hydrochemical conditions during storage periods periods of injection and storage periodically alternated depending on the availability of tile drainage water during astr operation we assessed pesticide degradation during the storage periods when groundwater was stagnant collected groundwater samples were anoxic at wells mw1 6 at 2 5 m distance from infiltration well a during the storage periods o2 was thus fully consumed during transport of tile drainage water from the injection well to the monitoring wells similarly no3 was already fully consumed at mw3 before the winter 2019 storage period started and at mw6 for all storage periods s4 2 no3 was initially present in all other cases mws and storage periods but its concentrations were steadily decreasing until depletion reflecting ongoing denitrification during storage fe concentrations mostly gradually increased which indicates reductive dissolution of fe hydr oxides so4 concentrations were increasing at most depths during the storage periods which is explained by pyrite oxidation linked to no3 reduction so4 concentrations decreased pointing to occurrence of so4 reduction at some depths and storage periods all storage periods at mw2 winter 2019 storage period at mw3 and spring 2021 storage period at mw6 the simultaneous occurrence of different redox conditions likely points to aquifer heterogeneity at the grain scale and therefore different conditions in pore spaces jakobsen 2007 jakobsen and postma 1999 abstracted water had a temperature range of 8 7 10 2 c during storage period 1 winter 2019 11 7 13 9 c during storage period 2 fall 2020 and 7 2 13 7 c during storage period 3 spring 2021 during all storage periods ph ranged from 6 6 to 7 3 doc concentrations from 14 0 to 26 3 mg l po4 from 0 05 to 2 60 mg l and nh4 from 0 1 1 3 mg l pesticide degradation was therefore studied under mostly no3 and metal oxide reducing conditions in the presence of mostly relatively high doc and nutrient concentrations 3 2 2 observed pesticide degradation during storage periods 3 2 2 1 degradation of fluopyram dt50 values were calculated during storage periods of astr operation fig 4 presents the dt50 values of fluopyram which are calculated based on the obtained first order rate constants k at the different aquifer depths during the three storage periods the 95 confidence intervals show the significance of the obtained k values the obtained k values were denominated statistically significant if the confidence interval excluded k 0 the normalized standard error nse is a measure of the scatter of the observed pesticide concentrations where a low nse indicates a more accurate dt50 value for example a nse of 0 1 represents a mean deviation of the regression line of 10 we show again the results of fluopyram because significant degradation was observed during one of the storage periods and the nse of the fitted data are smaller than those of most other pesticides and metabolites s4 4 degradation of fluopyram is slow or not significant dt50 values 158 days or negative except for the fall 2020 storage period for which a dt50 value of 59 days was estimated at mw 2 after the winter 2019 storage period the astr system was not in operation for another 275 days from 19 december 2019 19 september 2020 to assess long term trends water samples were taken 219 days 25 july 2020 after the start of this first storage period these samples likewise show that degradation is slow as observed concentrations after 219 days were only slightly lower than the concentrations during the storage period 3 2 2 2 degradation of all pesticides and metabolites table 3 shows the deduced dt50 values during the winter 2019 w 19 fall 2020 f 20 and spring 2021 storage period s 21 all first order rate constants and their 95 confidence intervals can be found in s4 3 most of the calculated dt50 values were significant 99 out of 162 note that 26 of the determined dt50 values was negative reflecting an increasing concentration trend substantially low negative dt50 values were not observed maximum negative dt50 value 95 days median 280 days but some of the negative dt50 values were significant these significant negative dt50 values point to some uncertainty of the applied method as will be explained later in more detail faster degradation 0 dt50 100 days occurred mostly for the pesticides boscalid flutolanil and imidacloprid the lowest positive dt50 value i e fastest degradation observed is 27 days flutolanil mw 5 but the median positive dt50 value is 184 days which shows that degradation is mostly slow this also corresponds with the pesticide concentrations in the samples taken 219 days after the start of the first storage period as concentrations were above the limit of detection for 37 out of 64 pesticides at all depths most dt50 values 100 days were observed for pesticides at mw2 in the fall 2020 storage period this seems to agree with the seemingly highest degradation rates at mw2 during the push pull tests it should be noted however that i the observed dt50 values during the push pull tests were generally more than a factor 5 lower than observed during the storage periods and ii these lower dt50 values were only observed during the 2nd fall 2020 storage period making it less likely that this layer in the aquifer has for some unknown reason special degradation capabilities 3 2 2 3 reliability obtained dt50 during storage periods our dt50 calculation method assumes for simplicity that i pesticide concentrations in the injected tile drainage water were constant over time and ii that degradation was negligible during transport from the injection well to the monitoring wells we can largely verify the second assumption as the average age of sampled tile drainage water 2 4 5 77 days s4 1 and the maximum age 8 5 days s4 1 at the start of the storage phase was considerably lower than the total duration of the storage phase almost 50 days based on both assumptions pesticide concentrations would be constant across the entire radius of abstraction 0 23 0 54 m for calculation see s4 1 of the total sampled water volume during the storage period any occurrence of degradation during storage would then lead to a decline in concentrations over time while being homogeneous in space the concentration data however do show some degree of scatter which is much larger than the analytical measurement uncertainty and in some cases result in increasing concentration trends over time we expect that these trends primarily reflect the temporal variation of pesticide concentrations in injected tile drainage water a collected sample essentially presents a mixture of slightly different ages of injected tile drainage water where with each subsequent collected sample the range in ages in the sample increases somewhat when degradation is absent or very slow as in this aquifer the scattering should mostly reflect temporal variations in pesticides concentrations in tile drainage water at the time of injection very low groundwater flow velocities resulting in 0 5 m displacement over 50 days of storage during storage may contribute to this effect on the one hand decreasing concentrations over time might in fact only reflect temporal variations in injected tile drainage water while degradation does not occur on the other hand it should be noted that in the aforementioned case degradation might in fact be higher than calculated when in subsequent samples there is a tendency towards collecting tile drainage water which initially had higher concentrations the bottom line is that calculated dt50 values are prone to some degree of uncertainty as concentrations in tile drainage water were not completely constant the fact that i overall decreasing concentration time trends were observed and ii most dt50 values were positive points to general occurrence of degradation in the aquifer albeit at very low rates 3 2 2 4 outcomes storage periods we arbitrarily decided to highlight pesticide trends with a minimum nse of 0 1 displayed in green in table 3 as we considered these trends convincing after a visual inspection of the figures in s4 4 in this selection only 6 of 86 dt50 are larger than 0 and smaller than 100 days despite the uncertainty in some of the dt50 values this learns us that pesticide degradation is mostly slow dt50 values 100 days or insignificant during storage periods of astr operation furthermore we do not see an increase in pesticide degradation rates as an effect of microbial adaptation of the aquifer or bioaugmentation of the aquifer by the injected tile drainage water microbiome therefore we expect that their effects i already occurred before the first storage period in the aquifer or ii did not quantifiably occur in the aquifer during the storage periods 3 3 pesticide degradation during operational monitoring pesticide concentrations were periodically measured at the monitoring wells 15 m away from injection well a during the entire period of astr operation fig 5 shows the results for d chloridazon and chloride cl d chloridazon is shown here as it was the only pesticide above the detection limit at mw b4 and b3 together with bentazon results for the other pesticides can be found in s6 1 cl was used as a natural conservative tracer as concentrations were lower in injected tile drainage water compared to the native groundwater decreasing cl concentrations therefore demonstrated the arrival of the injected tile drainage water at the monitored monitoring wells cl concentrations are relatively stable and indicative of native brackish saline groundwater at mw b1 2 5 and 6 freshening is occurring to some extent due to the arrival of fresh tile drainage water at mw b3 and more distinct at mw b4 this shows that the hydraulic conductivity of the aquifer is higher at mw b3 and b4 compared to the other depths injected tile drainage water preferentially flows through these layers and therefore freshening is only observed here at mw b4 the cl concentration decreased almost to that of injected tile drainage water mean injected tile drainage water concentrations can be found in table 1 d chloridazon was detected above the detection limit only during the last sampling event at these 2 depth levels where the tile drainage water arrived based on eq 2 normalized cl and pesticide concentrations were calculated where a normalized concentration of 1 presents injected tile drainage water and a normalized concentration of 0 the native groundwater pesticide concentrations can decrease due to degradation or sorption while cl as tracer is conservative and does not react the fraction of pesticide left in the sample was calculated and corrected for the fraction of cl by dividing the normalized reactant concentration by the normalized tracer concentration c r t c tr t bentazon and d chloridazon were the only pesticides observed above the detection limit at mw b3 only 45 of the injected bentazon concentration was observed and for d chloridazon approximately 9 retardation was small for bentazon r 1 1 and negligible for d chloridazon r 1 0 table 2 and therefore the decreasing concentration is mostly related to degradation the other monitored pesticides had larger r and did therefore not yet arrive the time between the start of astr operation and the arrival of the 50 front position was estimated at 485 days for mw b3 and 334 days for mw b4 dt50 values calculated were 433 and 141 days for bentazon and d chloridazon table 4 respectively at mw b3 s6 2 bentazon boscalid chloridazon d chloridazon md chloridazon fluopyram flutolanil and methoxyfenozide were observed above the detection limit at mw b4 negligible degradation c r t c tr t 0 99 was observed for chloridazon md chloridazon and flutolanil for the other pesticides between 61 and 74 of the injected concentrations were observed even for bentazon and fluopyram which were prone to small retardation r 1 1 degradation rates could be higher in reality for bentazon and fluopyram as also retardation could be the cause of the lowered concentrations note that retardation factors were not available for flutolanil and methoxyfenozide table 2 table 4 shows the estimated dt50 values for all pesticides at mw b3 and mw b4 the observed dt50 values for bentazon are similar at mw b3 and mw b4 while for d chloridazon the dt50 value at mw b3 are almost an order of magnitude lower the observed dt50 values during operational monitoring fall mostly within the range of the dt50 observed during the storage periods 3 4 comparison obtained dt50 values with previous studies table 5 gives an overview of the dt50 values of the studied pesticides and metabolites as deduced or reported in i this study ii the ppdb database which is an international database for risk assessment and management based on regulatory files lewis et al 2016 and iii previous pesticide degradation studies in field or column studies of aquifer systems several aquifer studies investigated the fate of bentazon and chloridazon bentazon dt50 values ranged from about 700 7000 days bertelkamp et al 2016b broholm et al 2001 stuyfzand et al 2007 tuxen et al 2000 only stuyfzand et al 2007 studied the fate of bentazon in groundwater under various redox conditions they observed a persistent behavior in suboxic and anoxic groundwaters which corresponds with the results obtained in the current study dt50 values of chloridazon ranged from 0 2 to 0 5 days in previous performed column studies with sands from a riverbank filtration site bertelkamp et al 2015 bertelkamp et al 2016a bertelkamp et al 2016c which was substantially faster than observed in our study nevertheless the dt50 values of chloridazon from the ppdb database are mostly in the same range as observed in this study to our knowledge degradation rate constants were not determined for the other pesticides in aquifer sediments therefore we compared our results with the ppdb database which consists mostly of dt50 values for topsoils collected from regulatory files the water phase only dt50 values from the ppdb database are generally a little lower than in the current study but the water sediment and the aerobic dt50 values are mostly within the same range table 6 shows the detection of the pesticides assessed in the current study in groundwater monitoring campaigns in europe bentazon was observed in groundwater at all monitoring networks in at least 1 of the monitored wells similarly boscalid chloridazon metabolites and flutolanil were observed in all monitoring programs when analyzed chloridazon was observed in groundwater in the netherlands united kingdom uk and italy but not in spain this shows that these pesticides are often persistent in groundwater systems the mostly low degradation rates observed during the storage periods and the operational monitoring in this study corresponds with the data from the european groundwater monitoring programs 4 conclusion in this study we assessed degradation of 7 commonly used pesticides and 2 metabolites before and during aquifer storage transfer and recovery astr tile drainage water containing pesticides ranging between 0 013 and 10 8 μg l was collected from a 10 ha agricultural parcel injected in an anoxic brackish saline aquifer and abstracted when water was needed for irrigation purposes we hypothesized that injection of fresh oxic nutrient and dissolved organic carbon doc rich mean concentrations no3 14 1 mg l nh4 0 13 mg l po4 5 2 mg l doc 24 7 mg l and probably microbially active tile drainage water would stimulate pesticide degradation push pull tests were performed to assess pesticide degradation in the native aquifer at 6 depths before astr operation retardation likely caused by pesticide sorption to sedimentary organic matter interfered unexpectedly with the degradation assessment for some of the pesticides therefore we could not obtain accurate dt50 values for all pesticides for the other pesticides degradation was not convincingly observed during the push pull tests which lasted for 18 days we recommend the use of push pull tests in future studies only when fast pesticide degradation dt50 values 20 days and negligible retardation is expected subsequently pesticide degradation was studied during 3 storage periods of 45 days spread out over a period of 1 5 years of astr operation obtained dt50 values were prone to some uncertainty related to variations in pesticide concentrations in the injected and later abstracted tile drainage water nonetheless generally decreasing pesticide concentrations were observed and mostly positive dt50 values which indicates degradation albeit at low rates with high half lives of at least 53 days degradation rate constants did not increase during the consecutive storage periods suggesting no influences of microbial adaptation and or bioaugmentation operational monitoring was performed at the wells at 15 m distance from the injection well pesticides were detected at only two depths after a travel time of approximately 485 and 334 days respectively estimated dt50 values were relatively high and exceeded 141 days lastly the obtained dt50 values were compared to existing literature and corresponded mostly to previous pesticide degradation studies in aquifers and groundwater monitoring studies therefore we found no strong evidence that pesticide degradation is stimulated by the co injection of electron acceptors o2 no3 doc nutrients and biodegrading bacteria as contained in tile drainage water the relatively high dt50 values consequently result in relatively high pesticide concentrations in abstracted astr water furthermore the persistent pesticides in the non abstracted water constitute a risk for contamination of the native brackish groundwater credit authorship contribution statement emiel kruisdijk conceptualization

1254,degradation of 7 common pesticides bentazon boscalid chloridazon fluopyram flutolanil imidacloprid and methoxyfenozide and 2 metabolites of chloridazon desphenyl chloridazon and methyl desphenyl chloridazon was studied in an anoxic and brackish sandy aquifer before and during aquifer storage transfer and recovery astr operation fresh tile drainage water was injected and stored for later re use as irrigation water we hypothesized that electron acceptors o2 no3 dissolved organic carbon 24 7 mg l nutrients no3 14 1 mg l nh4 0 13 mg l po4 5 2 mg l and biodegrading bacteria in tile drainage water could stimulate degradation of the pesticides and metabolites ranging between 0 013 and 10 8 μg l introduced in the aquifer pesticide degradation was studied at 6 depths in the aquifer using push pull tests lasting 18 days before the onset of astr operation degradation was too limited to quantify and or could not be assessed because of the potential occurrence of pesticide retardation utilizing push pull tests to obtain degradation constants should only be considered in future studies for non retarding pesticides with relative low half lives here 20 days during astr operation pesticide degradation was studied at the same depths during 3 storage periods equally spread over 1 5 years of astr operation overall trends of degradation were observed although with relatively high half lives of at least 53 days microbial adaptation of the aquifer and or bioaugmentation by the injected biodegrading bacteria did not result in enhanced degradation during consecutive storage periods operational monitoring data over longer periods and distances yielded half lives of at least 141 days the slow degradation mostly agrees with previous studies the injected tile drainage water composition did therefore not notably stimulate pesticide degradation the relatively persistent behavior of the studied pesticides metabolites implies that astr abstracted water will have generally high pesticide concentrations and non abstracted water may form a contamination risk for the surrounding native brackish groundwater graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords managed aquifer

technique to intentionally replenish groundwater for later re use dillon et al 2019 sprenger et al 2017 mar application has been initially focused on natural waters from streams lakes and aquifers

or as in the current study tile drainage water from agricultural lands kruisdijk and van breukelen 2021 tile drainage water originates from an agricultural drainage system which is designed to remove excess water in agricultural fields via subsurface pipes this system optimizes crop growth and prevents rotting and crop death residence and transport of infiltrated water in aquifers is known to often improve water quality during mar e g bekele et al 2018 dillon et al 2003 in the current study we assessed the degradation rates of pesticides and metabolites as introduced with tile drainage water during mar operation in order to better assess the risks for groundwater contamination pesticide degradation depends on the physicochemical characteristics of the pesticide arias estevez et al 2008 fenner et al 2013 its initial concentration baumgarten et al 2011 oberleitner et al 2020 and aquifer conditions such as temperature munz et al 2019 storck et al 2012 ph arias estévez et al 2008

composition bertelkamp et al 2016a regnery et al 2015 greskowiak et al 2017 compared biodegradation rate constants of 82 emerging organic compounds of which 8 pesticides from 48 studies and observed that most of the rate constants vary over 3 orders of magnitude this indicates the large impact of the above mentioned conditions on pesticide degradation microbial adaptation is another factor influencing pesticide degradation it is defined as the time needed for the microbial population to adjust to a new introduced chemical alexander 1999 adaptation times can vary between a few hours to several years alexander 1999 baumgarten et al 2011 but generally do not exceed 6 months hoppe jones et al 2012 during this time the microbial community changes in composition and or in abundances furthermore biodegradation can be enhanced by introducing new types of bacteria as naturally part of the infiltration water to the aquifer during mar e g bioaugmentation microbial adaptation and bioaugmentation are both often indicated by increasing pesticide degradation rates over time fetter et al 1999 hoppe jones et al 2012 degradation of pesticides or other organic micro pollutants have been studied before in full scale mar systems for example riverbank filtration sites e g hamann et al 2016 oberleitner et al 2020 basin recharge systems kuster et al 2010 and aquifer storage and recovery asr sites e g page et al 2014 stuyfzand et al 2007 many of these studies focused on mar systems with travel times up to several years which permitted the use of averaged input levels as water composition was substantially homogenized during aquifer transport wiese et al 2011 this approach is not suitable for smaller scale systems as in the current study as aquifer travel times between injection and abstraction can be relatively short in the order of days to weeks and concentrations of the injected water can fluctuate considerably huntscha et al 2013 aquifer storage transfer and recovery astr is one of the various methods of mar wherein water is stored in an aquifer during wet periods via well injection and abstracted from another well when needed in the current study we monitored an astr system in which fresh tile drainage water is collected from an agricultural parcel during wet periods injected and stored in the originally brackish coastal aquifer and abstracted when needed e g during droughts for irrigation purposes on the same plot we focused on the degradation of 7 common pesticides and 2 metabolites the current research is a follow up on the research performed by kruisdijk et al 2022 they studied pesticide sorption during astr in the same aquifer as the current study the obtained sorption parameters in kruisdijk et al 2022 were used in the analysis of the current research which is appropriate as about the same set of pesticides was studied at the same depths we hypothesized that conditions in the current mar application are favorable for pesticide degradation as injected tile drainage water contains electron acceptors e g o2 no3 nutrients doc and likely biodegrading bacteria besides the injected pesticides and metabolites these factors can stimulate biodegradation aldas vargas et al 2021 luo et al 2019 while in oligotrophic groundwater systems biodegradation is often limited due to limited carbon and nutrient sources egli 2010 push pull tests were performed to assess pesticide degradation in the native aquifer before the start of astr operation furthermore pesticide degradation was monitored during three storage periods of astr operation and by periodical operational monitoring the research objectives of the current study were to i determine degradation rate constants for several pesticides and metabolites at 6 different depths within the aquifer to better assess the risks for groundwater contamination during mar ii assess if degradation rate constants increase over time in subsequent storage periods due

description pesticide degradation was examined in an aquifer storage transfer and recovery astr system for agricultural use in the north western part of the netherlands coordinates 52 8883 4 8221 injected water is collected from a tile drainage network approximately 1 m below the 10 ha agricultural parcel fig 1 tile drainage water in this network ends up in a collection drain from where it is discharged to the astr system the collected tile drainage water is injected in the aquifer by 2 wells well screens ranging from 11 5 to 33 0 m below surface level b s l injection well a and b the water can be retrieved by 4 abstraction wells well screens ranging from 12 0 to 23 0 m b s l in periods of drought and re used for crop irrigation a holocene peaty clay layer confines the target aquifer ranging from surface level to about 10 m b s l the sandy aquifer itself is of late pleistocene and holocene origin and reaches to about 45 m b s l for monitoring purposes 2 sets of 6 piezometers 1 in diameter were constructed at 2 5 m monitoring well mw 1 6 and at about 15 m mw b1 b6 distance from injection well a fig 1 kruisdijk et al 2022 studied pesticide sorption at the same monitoring wells mw1 6 and observed that the hydraulic conductivity was highest at the well screen depth of mw4 moderate at mw3 and 5 and relatively low at mw1 2 and 6 2 2 overview of study and astr operation fig 2 shows an overview of the total injected volumes during astr operation before the start of astr operation push pull tests were performed from 25 february till 18 march 2019 astr operation started with the injection of 2700 m3 water in the first operation period during operation period 2 and 3 2900 and 4300 m3 of water were injected respectively storage periods took place after each operation period in winter 2019 from 19 december 2019 to 2 february 2020 fall 2020 from 14 october 2020 to 24 november 2020 and spring 2021 from 18 march 2021 to 03 may 2021 2 3 push pull tests 2 3 1 method push pull tests consist of a push phase during which water with a known quality is injected through a groundwater well and a subsequent pull phase during which the injected water is gradually abstracted abstracted water is periodically sampled after which the water quality changes of these samples were assessed push pull tests were performed in 6 monitoring wells mw1 6 located at different depths ranging from 11 4 to 32 2 m b s l table 1 samples from the native groundwater were taken before the start of the push pull tests injection water consisted of approximately 300 l tile drainage water to which 0 1 mmol l br as nabr was added as a conservative tracer and a solution with pesticides and metabolites selected on the basis of a multi criteria analysis for more information see kruisdijk et al 2022 the reactant solution was prepared in advance and consisted of the pesticides bentazon boscalid chloridazon fluopyram flutolanil imidacloprid methoxyfenozide and the metabolites of chloridazon desphenyl chloridazon d chloridazon and methyl desphenyl chloridazon md chloridazon approximately 9 mg of each pesticide was added to 6 l of distilled water next the solution was mixed for 48 h using a magnetic stir plate a small coagulate of the reactants developed in the bottle which was removed from the solution therefore final reactant concentrations were somewhat lower than aimed at lastly the obtained solution was divided over 6 glass bottles of 1 l one bottle for each monitoring well this would result in a maximum concentration of 5 μg l when added to the 300 l tile drainage water obtained from the collection drain which fits inside the typical range of pesticide concentrations observed in tile drainage water observed in the current study see table 1 for each monitoring well a storage tank containing tile drainage water plus reactants was prepared in the storage tank the tile drainage water was thoroughly mixed manually with a pole after adding the pesticide solutions water in the storage tank was injected using a peristaltic pump eijkelkamp the netherlands through each of the 6 monitoring wells in approximately 2 5 h with a steady flow of about 2 l min push phase four water samples were taken of the injected water equally spread over time during the pull phase the period in between sampling was for the first samples 4 h but gradually increased until maximum three days in between the last samples the total push pull test duration was 17 or 18 days during which 14 water samples were taken during the first 12 samples 360 l water was abstracted 12 30 l 30 l is substantially more than the max standing well volume of 17 l on the last day a total of 120 l was abstracted during which 2 water samples were collected after abstraction of 60 and 120 l 2 3 2 data analysis first order degradation rate constants k were determined based on the well mixed reactor model haggerty et al 1998 which was successfully used in previous studies e g huntscha et al 2013 kruisdijk and van breukelen 2021 vandenbohede et al 2008 this model is shown to be accurate when the push phase takes substantially less time than the pull phase which is valid in our case push phase 2 5 h pull phase 400 h to assess the significance of the calculated rate constants 95 confidence limits were calculated from the variance of the degradation rate constants schroth et al 2000 first order reaction rate constants were estimated based on eq 1 developed by haggerty et al 1998 which is valid if the retardation factors of the tracer and reactants are identical 1 ln c r t c tr t ln 1 e k t inj k t inj k t where c r t and c tr t are normalized concentrations of respectively the reactant and the tracer at time t days k is the first order reaction rate constant of the reactant day 1 t inj is the duration of the push phase days and t is the time elapsed since the push phase days br was used as the tracer for mw1 mw4 unfortunately br concentrations in injected water 8 2 9 6 mg l were relatively close to the native groundwater concentrations at mw 5 and mw 6 7 2 and 13 0 mg l respectively cl concentrations varied more distinctly between injected 255 436 mg l and native groundwater for mw 5 and mw 6 1780 and 3170 mg l respectively and was used as the tracer at these depths rate constants were estimated by fitting a regression line to a plot of ln c r t c tr t versus t which generates a line with a slope k only the water samples were used where c tr t 0 2 we assumed that assessing water samples where c tr t 0 2 resulted in larger uncertainties as i lower c tr t infers that a larger part of the abstracted water originates from native groundwater which means that the tracer and reactant concentrations become lower and measurement errors increasingly influence the obtained k and ii tracer concentrations in groundwater are not 100 homogeneous which leads to higher uncertainties for lower c tr t normalized concentrations were calculated for tracer and reactants following eq 2 2 c tr c tr c gw c inf c gw c r c r c 1 st sample where c tr is the tracer concentration during the pull phase mg l c gw the concentration in native groundwater mg l c inf the mean concentration of the 4 samples taken during injection mg l c r the reactant concentration during the pull phase mg l and c 1 st sample the concentration of the first abstracted sample during the pull phase mg l different equations were used for the normalized concentrations of the tracer and the reactants because we observed unexpectedly higher concentrations in the first samples of the pull phase than in the injection phase for some of the reactants this suggests that the total concentration of the added reactant was not fully analyzed during the injection phase for which we cannot provide a clear explanation therefore we used c 1 st sample for the reactants instead of c inf c gw was 0 for the reactants and could therefore be neglected a nonlinear least squares routine was used to fit eq 1 to the observed concentrations in python python v 3 6 4 the influence of pesticide retardation on the push pull test breakthrough

during the push pull tests before aquifer storage transfer and recovery astr operation push pull tests were conducted to assess the initial capacity of the native anoxic brackish aquifer to degrade pesticides and metabolites in injected tile drainage water tile drainage water was injected at 6 different depths via the monitoring wells 1 6 mw1 6 located at 2 5 m from injection well a during the push phase of the push pull tests fig 1 injected tile drainage water had o2 concentrations ranging from 5 4 to 9 6 mg l dissolved organic carbon doc concentrations between 20 8 and 23 8 mg l and relatively high nutrient concentrations no3 41 1 49 7 mg l po4 6 54 9 98 mg l nh4 0 04 0 85 mg l water temperature ranged from 7 0 to 14 4 c and ph from 7 2 to 8 0 table 1 shows the native groundwater composition at the well screen depths of mw1 6 before the push pull tests and astr operation the native groundwater was anoxic o2 and no3 below detection limit with mainly mn iv and fe iii reducing conditions based on the relatively high concentrations of mn ii and fe ii respectively table 1 the shallow part of the aquifer was relatively fresh electrical conductivity ec at mw1 2 and 3 11 4 19 3 m below surface was between 1850 and 2000 μs cm and turned more saline with depth ec at mw4 5 and 6 22 78 32 2 m below surface was 3280 5090 and 8930 μs cm respectively during the pull phase of the push pull tests redox conditions changed rapidly in the abstracted water as shown in more detail in s3 2 injected water became anoxic within 1 day of residence in the aquifer and subsequently no3 reducing conditions were observed at all depths furthermore reductive dissolution of fe and mn oxides probably occurred so4 reduction was not observed except at mw2 any degradation of pesticides and metabolites thus occurred at about neutral ph under mostly no3 and or metal oxide reducing conditions during the push pull tests 3 1 2 observed pesticide degradation during the push pull tests fig 3 shows the push pull test results of fluopyram for a selection of depths the classes stated in the labels will be explained later in this section the results are shown for the other depths and pesticides metabolites in s3 3 in the left panels concentrations of the tracer br or cl and fluopyram gradually decreased because of dispersive mixing with native groundwater during the abstraction phase of the push pull tests except for mw5 and mw6 s3 3 where cl concentrations were higher in native groundwater compared to injected tile drainage water due to the higher salinity at larger depths in the aquifer similar trends were observed for the normalized concentrations in the middle panels where the occurrence of degradation was suggested by a faster decline of normalized fluopyram concentrations compared to those of the conservative tracer in the right panel linear regression was performed on the natural logarithm of the normalized fluopyram concentrations divided by the normalized tracer over time from which the first order degradation rate constants and half lives dt50 were estimated by eq 1 the calculated 95 confidence intervals were used to denominate the obtained k values as statistically significant when they excluded k 0 3 1 2 1 influences of retardation on obtained dt50 the performed method is only valid when retardation is assumed negligible as pesticide retardation can also result in decreasing pesticide concentrations which can influence the estimated dt50 value schroth et al 2000 degradation is indicated by normalized pesticide concentrations lower than those of the conservative tracer during the entire pull phase haggerty et al 1998 whereas sorption is indicated by initially lower concentrations until the arrival of the 50 front position i e where the normalized tracer concentration 0 5 followed by higher concentrations afterwards schroth et al 2000 see s3 1 analytical solutions are not available which can disentangle sorption from degradation kruisdijk et al 2022 obtained retardation factors r of about the same set of pesticides and metabolites at the same depths in the aquifer for a short description of the method see s3 4 most 32 out of 38 r values range between 0 8 and 2 0 table 2 the highest r values were observed at the top of the aquifer and generally decreased with depth which corresponded with the higher sedimentary organic matter contents at the top of the aquifer compared to the bottom before the onset of the push pull tests we simulated the influence of pesticide retardation on the push pull test breakthrough curves using eqs 3 and 4 schroth et al 2000 stated that methodological errors of 14 could be expected in a physically and chemically homogeneous aquifer by using these equations however errors could be larger under more heterogeneous conditions the variation in pesticide concentrations was 5 1 relative concentration when r 2 relative concentration when r 1 100 when estimating pesticide concentrations by r 2 compared to r 1 s3 1 based on these outcomes we did not expect major interferences from pesticide retardation in the current study to examine the actual influence of sorption in the obtained data during the push pull tests we first visually examined the trends observed in the figs s3 11 in s3 3 and categorized these trends in 5 classes table 2 1 the reactant behaves similarly as the conservative tracer or the reactant acts differently due to 2 degradation 3 sorption 4 unknown reasons e g scattered concentrations or 5 sorption or degradation no clear distinction fig 3 shows an example of the categorization of the push pull test results for a selection of depths of fluopyram where the trend at mw1 was categorized as sorption class 3 at mw2 as degradation class 2 and at mw5 as similar to the conservative tracer class 1 table 2 presents the estimated dt50 values the results of the qualitative assessment and the retardation factors obtained from kruisdijk et al 2022 kruisdijk et al 2022 observed r 1 at 2 depths for a few pesticides the mechanism behind the r 1 remained unclear although a relation with doc associated transport seemed unlikely most estimated dt50 values were positive 51 out of 64 negative dt50 values were observed during the push pull tests but were all insignificant significant dt50 values 39 out of 64 ranged from 5 2 to 45 days at mw1 all pesticide and metabolite concentration trends resembled those associated with sorption this corresponds with the retardation factors in table 1 which show that pesticide sorption was most substantial at mw1 compared to the other depths nevertheless sorption influences were not only observed if r 2 0 as suggested by the calculations using eq 3 s3 1 but also for r 1 3 d chloridazon and r 1 5 md chloridazon at mw1 at the other depths the influence of sorption was observed for 7 pesticides metabolites where r was lower than 2 and was even observed when r was estimated about equal to 1 this shows that sorption played a substantially bigger role than expected based on the analytical equation of schroth et al 2000 which is additionally shown by the relatively large occurrence of the sorption related class 3 31 the discrepancy between the analytical solution and the observed results is probably resulting from physical or chemical heterogeneity of the aquifer layers in the current study which schroth et al 2000 stated as a drawback of this method this made it impossible to estimate a realistic dt50 value for the pesticides and metabolites which were influenced by sorption 3 1 2 2 outcomes push pull tests the orange cells represent class 2 where a clear pesticide degradation trend was observed remarkably such a degradation trend was only observed for 5 pesticides metabolites chloridazon md chloridazon fluopyram imidacloprid and methoxyfenozide and only at mw2 these trends represented some of the lowest dt50 values 5 2 13 days we question these degradation trends observed at mw2 as i we deem it unlikely that degradation only occurred at this depth for no apparent reason ii no influences of sorption are observed while the r values are only slightly lower compared to mw1 and iii the results do not agree with the results obtained during the storage periods section 3 2 nevertheless no clear explanation can be given for the observed trends observed at mw2 despite degradation dt50 values were also estimated for class 1 the class in which pesticides and metabolites visually act similar as the conservative tracer in class 1 the minimum positive dt50 value was 23 days estimated dt50 values 20 days seem highly uncertain as these dt50 values are substantially larger than the durations of the push pull tests 7 12 days which makes it troublesome to disentangle degradation and the scatter of pesticide concentrations in the current study the obtained dt50 have a relatively low reliability due to the unexpected effects of pesticide retardation and the relatively short time span of the push pull tests in combination with the mostly high dt50 obtained we learned that push pull tests are only useful when pesticide degradation is relatively fast here dt50 values 20 days and pesticide retardation is negligible huntscha et al 2013 successfully obtained first order degradation rate constants using push pull tests but studied non retarding organic micropollutants which degraded much faster k values in order of hour 1 from the data in the current study we can conclude that degradation could have occurred for some pesticides and metabolites at mw2 before the start of astr operation but generally it did not or was too small to observe dt50 values 20 days 3 2 pesticide degradation during storage periods of astr operation 3 2 1 hydrochemical conditions during storage periods periods of injection and storage periodically alternated depending on the availability of tile drainage water during astr operation we assessed pesticide degradation during the storage periods when groundwater was stagnant collected groundwater samples were anoxic at wells mw1 6 at 2 5 m distance from infiltration well a during the storage periods o2 was thus fully consumed during transport of tile drainage water from the injection well to the monitoring wells similarly no3 was already fully consumed at mw3 before the winter 2019 storage period started and at mw6 for all storage periods s4 2 no3 was initially present in all other cases mws and storage periods but its concentrations were steadily decreasing until depletion reflecting ongoing denitrification during storage fe concentrations mostly gradually increased which indicates reductive dissolution of fe hydr oxides so4 concentrations were increasing at most depths during the storage periods which is explained by pyrite oxidation linked to no3 reduction so4 concentrations decreased pointing to occurrence of so4 reduction at some depths and storage periods all storage periods at mw2 winter 2019 storage period at mw3 and spring 2021 storage period at mw6 the simultaneous occurrence of different redox conditions likely points to aquifer heterogeneity at the grain scale and therefore different conditions in pore spaces jakobsen 2007 jakobsen and postma 1999 abstracted water had a temperature range of 8 7 10 2 c during storage period 1 winter 2019 11 7 13 9 c during storage period 2 fall 2020 and 7 2 13 7 c during storage period 3 spring 2021 during all storage periods ph ranged from 6 6 to 7 3 doc concentrations from 14 0 to 26 3 mg l po4 from 0 05 to 2 60 mg l and nh4 from 0 1 1 3 mg l pesticide degradation was therefore studied under mostly no3 and metal oxide reducing conditions in the presence of mostly relatively high doc and nutrient concentrations 3 2 2 observed pesticide degradation during storage periods 3 2 2 1 degradation of fluopyram dt50 values were calculated during storage periods of astr operation fig 4 presents the dt50 values of fluopyram which are calculated based on the obtained first order rate constants k at the different aquifer depths during the three storage periods the 95 confidence intervals show the significance of the obtained k values the obtained k values were denominated statistically significant if the confidence interval excluded k 0 the normalized standard error nse is a measure of the scatter of the observed pesticide concentrations where a low nse indicates a more accurate dt50 value for example a nse of 0 1 represents a mean deviation of the regression line of 10 we show again the results of fluopyram because significant degradation was observed during one of the storage periods and the nse of the fitted data are smaller than those of most other pesticides and metabolites s4 4 degradation of fluopyram is slow or not significant dt50 values 158 days or negative except for the fall 2020 storage period for which a dt50 value of 59 days was estimated at mw 2 after the winter 2019 storage period the astr system was not in operation for another 275 days from 19 december 2019 19 september 2020 to assess long term trends water samples were taken 219 days 25 july 2020 after the start of this first storage period these samples likewise show that degradation is slow as observed concentrations after 219 days were only slightly lower than the concentrations during the storage period 3 2 2 2 degradation of all pesticides and metabolites table 3 shows the deduced dt50 values during the winter 2019 w 19 fall 2020 f 20 and spring 2021 storage period s 21 all first order rate constants and their 95 confidence intervals can be found in s4 3 most of the calculated dt50 values were significant 99 out of 162 note that 26 of the determined dt50 values was negative reflecting an increasing concentration trend substantially low negative dt50 values were not observed maximum negative dt50 value 95 days median 280 days but some of the negative dt50 values were significant these significant negative dt50 values point to some uncertainty of the applied method as will be explained later in more detail faster degradation 0 dt50 100 days occurred mostly for the pesticides boscalid flutolanil and imidacloprid the lowest positive dt50 value i e fastest degradation observed is 27 days flutolanil mw 5 but the median positive dt50 value is 184 days which shows that degradation is mostly slow this also corresponds with the pesticide concentrations in the samples taken 219 days after the start of the first storage period as concentrations were above the limit of detection for 37 out of 64 pesticides at all depths most dt50 values 100 days were observed for pesticides at mw2 in the fall 2020 storage period this seems to agree with the seemingly highest degradation rates at mw2 during the push pull tests it should be noted however that i the observed dt50 values during the push pull tests were generally more than a factor 5 lower than observed during the storage periods and ii these lower dt50 values were only observed during the 2nd fall 2020 storage period making it less likely that this layer in the aquifer has for some unknown reason special degradation capabilities 3 2 2 3 reliability obtained dt50 during storage periods our dt50 calculation method assumes for simplicity that i pesticide concentrations in the injected tile drainage water were constant over time and ii that degradation was negligible during transport from the injection well to the monitoring wells we can largely verify the second assumption as the average age of sampled tile drainage water 2 4 5 77 days s4 1 and the maximum age 8 5 days s4 1 at the start of the storage phase was considerably lower than the total duration of the storage phase almost 50 days based on both assumptions pesticide concentrations would be constant across the entire radius of abstraction 0 23 0 54 m for calculation see s4 1 of the total sampled water volume during the storage period any occurrence of degradation during storage would then lead to a decline in concentrations over time while being homogeneous in space the concentration data however do show some degree of scatter which is much larger than the analytical measurement uncertainty and in some cases result in increasing concentration trends over time we expect that these trends primarily reflect the temporal variation of pesticide concentrations in injected tile drainage water a collected sample essentially presents a mixture of slightly different ages of injected tile drainage water where with each subsequent collected sample the range in ages in the sample increases somewhat when degradation is absent or very slow as in this aquifer the scattering should mostly reflect temporal variations in pesticides concentrations in tile drainage water at the time of injection very low groundwater flow velocities resulting in 0 5 m displacement over 50 days of storage during storage may contribute to this effect on the one hand decreasing concentrations over time might in fact only reflect temporal variations in injected tile drainage water while degradation does not occur on the other hand it should be noted that in the aforementioned case degradation might in fact be higher than calculated when in subsequent samples there is a tendency towards collecting tile drainage water which initially had higher concentrations the bottom line is that calculated dt50 values are prone to some degree of uncertainty as concentrations in tile drainage water were not completely constant the fact that i overall decreasing concentration time trends were observed and ii most dt50 values were positive points to general occurrence of degradation in the aquifer albeit at very low rates 3 2 2 4 outcomes storage periods we arbitrarily decided to highlight pesticide trends with a minimum nse of 0 1 displayed in green in table 3 as we considered these trends convincing after a visual inspection of the figures in s4 4 in this selection only 6 of 86 dt50 are larger than 0 and smaller than 100 days despite the uncertainty in some of the dt50 values this learns us that pesticide degradation is mostly slow dt50 values 100 days or insignificant during storage periods of astr operation furthermore we do not see an increase in pesticide degradation rates as an effect of microbial adaptation of the aquifer or bioaugmentation of the aquifer by the injected tile drainage water microbiome therefore we expect that their effects i already occurred before the first storage period in the aquifer or ii did not quantifiably occur in the aquifer during the storage periods 3 3 pesticide degradation during operational monitoring pesticide concentrations were periodically measured at the monitoring wells 15 m away from injection well a during the entire period of astr operation fig 5 shows the results for d chloridazon and chloride cl d chloridazon is shown here as it was the only pesticide above the detection limit at mw b4 and b3 together with bentazon results for the other pesticides can be found in s6 1 cl was used as a natural conservative tracer as concentrations were lower in injected tile drainage water compared to the native groundwater decreasing cl concentrations therefore demonstrated the arrival of the injected tile drainage water at the monitored monitoring wells cl concentrations are relatively stable and indicative of native brackish saline groundwater at mw b1 2 5 and 6 freshening is occurring to some extent due to the arrival of fresh tile drainage water at mw b3 and more distinct at mw b4 this shows that the hydraulic conductivity of the aquifer is higher at mw b3 and b4 compared to the other depths injected tile drainage water preferentially flows through these layers and therefore freshening is only observed here at mw b4 the cl concentration decreased almost to that of injected tile drainage water mean injected tile drainage water concentrations can be found in table 1 d chloridazon was detected above the detection limit only during the last sampling event at these 2 depth levels where the tile drainage water arrived based on eq 2 normalized cl and pesticide concentrations were calculated where a normalized concentration of 1 presents injected tile drainage water and a normalized concentration of 0 the native groundwater pesticide concentrations can decrease due to degradation or sorption while cl as tracer is conservative and does not react the fraction of pesticide left in the sample was calculated and corrected for the fraction of cl by dividing the normalized reactant concentration by the normalized tracer concentration c r t c tr t bentazon and d chloridazon were the only pesticides observed above the detection limit at mw b3 only 45 of the injected bentazon concentration was observed and for d chloridazon approximately 9 retardation was small for bentazon r 1 1 and negligible for d chloridazon r 1 0 table 2 and therefore the decreasing concentration is mostly related to degradation the other monitored pesticides had larger r and did therefore not yet arrive the time between the start of astr operation and the arrival of the 50 front position was estimated at 485 days for mw b3 and 334 days for mw b4 dt50 values calculated were 433 and 141 days for bentazon and d chloridazon table 4 respectively at mw b3 s6 2 bentazon boscalid chloridazon d chloridazon md chloridazon fluopyram flutolanil and methoxyfenozide were observed above the detection limit at mw b4 negligible degradation c r t c tr t 0 99 was observed for chloridazon md chloridazon and flutolanil for the other pesticides between 61 and 74 of the injected concentrations were observed even for bentazon and fluopyram which were prone to small retardation r 1 1 degradation rates could be higher in reality for bentazon and fluopyram as also retardation could be the cause of the lowered concentrations note that retardation factors were not available for flutolanil and methoxyfenozide table 2 table 4 shows the estimated dt50 values for all pesticides at mw b3 and mw b4 the observed dt50 values for bentazon are similar at mw b3 and mw b4 while for d chloridazon the dt50 value at mw b3 are almost an order of magnitude lower the observed dt50 values during operational monitoring fall mostly within the range of the dt50 observed during the storage periods 3 4 comparison obtained dt50 values with previous studies table 5 gives an overview of the dt50 values of the studied pesticides and metabolites as deduced or reported in i this study ii the ppdb database which is an international database for risk assessment and management based on regulatory files lewis et al 2016 and iii previous pesticide degradation studies in field or column studies of aquifer systems several aquifer studies investigated the fate of bentazon and chloridazon bentazon dt50 values ranged from about 700 7000 days bertelkamp et al 2016b broholm et al 2001 stuyfzand et al 2007 tuxen et al 2000 only stuyfzand et al 2007 studied the fate of bentazon in groundwater under various redox conditions they observed a persistent behavior in suboxic and anoxic groundwaters which corresponds with the results obtained in the current study dt50 values of chloridazon ranged from 0 2 to 0 5 days in previous performed column studies with sands from a riverbank filtration site bertelkamp et al 2015 bertelkamp et al 2016a bertelkamp et al 2016c which was substantially faster than observed in our study nevertheless the dt50 values of chloridazon from the ppdb database are mostly in the same range as observed in this study to our knowledge degradation rate constants were not determined for the other pesticides in aquifer sediments therefore we compared our results with the ppdb database which consists mostly of dt50 values for topsoils collected from regulatory files the water phase only dt50 values from the ppdb database are generally a little lower than in the current study but the water sediment and the aerobic dt50 values are mostly within the same range table 6 shows the detection of the pesticides assessed in the current study in groundwater monitoring campaigns in europe bentazon was observed in groundwater at all monitoring networks in at least 1 of the monitored wells similarly boscalid chloridazon metabolites and flutolanil were observed in all monitoring programs when analyzed chloridazon was observed in groundwater in the netherlands united kingdom uk and italy but not in spain this shows that these pesticides are often persistent in groundwater systems the mostly low degradation rates observed during the storage periods and the operational monitoring in this study corresponds with the data from the european groundwater monitoring programs 4 conclusion in this study we assessed degradation of 7 commonly used pesticides and 2 metabolites before and during aquifer storage transfer and recovery astr tile drainage water containing pesticides ranging between 0 013 and 10 8 μg l was collected from a 10 ha agricultural parcel injected in an anoxic brackish saline aquifer and abstracted

doc 24 7 mg l and probably microbially active tile drainage water would stimulate pesticide degradation push pull tests were performed to assess pesticide degradation in the native aquifer at 6 depths before astr operation retardation likely caused by pesticide sorption to sedimentary organic matter interfered unexpectedly with the degradation assessment for some of the pesticides therefore we could not obtain accurate dt50 values for all pesticides for the other pesticides degradation was not convincingly observed during the push pull tests which lasted for 18 days we recommend the use of push pull tests in future studies only when fast pesticide degradation dt50 values 20 days and negligible retardation is expected subsequently pesticide degradation was studied during 3 storage periods of 45 days spread out over a period of 1 5 years of astr operation obtained dt50 values were prone to some uncertainty related to variations in pesticide concentrations in the injected and later abstracted tile drainage water nonetheless generally decreasing pesticide concentrations were observed and mostly positive dt50 values which indicates degradation albeit at low rates with high half lives of at least 53 days degradation rate constants did not increase during the consecutive storage periods suggesting no influences of microbial adaptation and or bioaugmentation operational monitoring was performed at the wells at 15 m distance from the injection well pesticides were detected at only two depths after a travel time of approximately 485 and 334 days respectively estimated dt50 values were relatively high and exceeded 141 days lastly the obtained dt50 values were compared to existing literature and corresponded mostly to previous pesticide degradation studies in aquifers and groundwater monitoring studies therefore we found no strong evidence that pesticide degradation is stimulated by the co injection of electron acceptors o2 no3 doc nutrients and biodegrading bacteria as contained in tile drainage water the relatively high dt50 values consequently result in relatively high pesticide concentrations in abstracted astr water furthermore the persistent pesticides in the non abstracted water constitute a risk for contamination of the native brackish groundwater credit authorship contribution statement emiel kruisdijk conceptualization
